1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,030
It's kind of weird how it took a long
time for three d me to come back.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,390
I they think I really
made it come back either.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,260
Well Dude Avatar in my opinion,

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,290
the admitted combat and I saw it in imax
three d that's like an experienced man.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,670
I had a smile on my face,

7
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:20,250
that whole movie and when I heard
all these people that were like,

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,790
oh the movies to the plot was very
transparent and like oh my God,

9
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,624
shut up.

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,411
Shut up.

11
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:25,891
Stupid.

12
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,000
How could you not enjoy that?

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,240
Oh you're telling me the
big blue aliens aren't real.

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,080
Whoa.

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,960
Get out of here

16
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,800
after Avatar.

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,480
People reporting depression like,

18
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:37,920
but yeah,

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,160
cause they liked our
depression is a real thing.

20
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,581
Yeah,

21
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:44,580
it's a fucking is now there's
no color and after Avatar.

22
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,930
I wonder how it's recognized.

23
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:48,550
I wonder if like psychologists
are behind it as well.

24
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,040
You have avatar depression.

25
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,030
It sounds like you've got a
bad case of Avatar to press.

26
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,820
That's not outside of
the realm of possibility.

27
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,683
Oh I'm sure.

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,050
Yeah.

29
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,231
Well,

30
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:03,030
I know the depression that comes from
playing a really awesome video game and

31
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:04,530
then going out into the world.

32
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,211
You know what I mean?

33
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:08,300
Like we were driving
here and we'd go back,

34
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,240
we'd go by this mountain of rocks and
he looks out the window and he goes,

35
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,601
oh,

36
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:13,261
that's like,

37
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:14,670
what does that look from our,

38
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,863
oh,

39
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,933
I'm like,

40
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,430
I don't even know what that means.

41
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,260
You have a fantasy environment.

42
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,500
What the fuck are you talking about?

43
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,351
Well,

44
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,940
I just got this Imac.

45
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,220
I just got this like giant Imac,

46
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:31,410
like the biggest monitor I've ever had.

47
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,191
So I was like,

48
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:32,580
well,

49
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,413
aren't those awesome?

50
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,620
I've got to see what works.

51
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:35,101
Suck.

52
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:35,970
Mine died today.

53
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:36,181
Yeah,

54
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:37,380
but it's probably just a hard drive.

55
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:37,840
No,

56
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,580
I hope not.

57
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,413
Oh God,

58
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,190
I'd got to back your shit up,

59
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,253
dude.

60
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,350
There are,

61
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,670
there are things back.

62
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,180
Not that,

63
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,871
not that computer,

64
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:47,430
because I use that
computer just for audio,

65
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,390
like you know,

66
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:53,391
for podcasts and slap a
fucking one terabyte drive
on it and one time timeshare

67
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,020
full drives.

68
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,790
I just keep on running
on of hard drive space.

69
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,150
Wow.

70
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,983
That's incredible.

71
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,250
Fucking sucks.

72
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,120
That shouldn't needs to go away.

73
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:00,954
What happened to,

74
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,580
I remember when I worked
at gateway computers,

75
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,950
I don't know if we talked about it
as anyway he's telling him come on,

76
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,521
design it back.

77
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:06,354
It is awesome.

78
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,340
I know you were saying that your shit
died but it is awesome and what were you

79
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:09,901
going to say about that?

80
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:14,901
I was going to say it's like a fucking
window and do an alternate universe.

81
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:18,420
When you've got a really good video
game and you're looking at it,

82
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,590
it's like these,

83
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,000
I think the word video games,

84
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,070
you got to go down the
tube is man because you,

85
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,360
you,

86
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,821
someone hears,

87
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:24,031
you say,

88
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:25,080
I love to play video games.

89
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,520
They're like you fucking nerd.

90
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,650
But it's like hey cause
you know it's like what,

91
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,660
what it's turning into.

92
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:31,494
It's not really,

93
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,130
it's going to get to the point where
it's not video games anymore where it's

94
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:35,911
something else.

95
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:38,550
Like I feel like it's
like world of Warcraft,

96
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,320
starcraft,

97
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,030
all these like a portal.

98
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,541
What we're,

99
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:47,541
this is the very first surge of water
and this virtual tsunami that's about to

100
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:51,180
come subjectively sweeping over everyone.

101
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:55,590
Because that thing you say about like
maybe our neurology can't resist movies

102
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:56,790
cause it's so overpowering.

103
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,980
It's like I think that there's
gonna be some truth to that

104
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,770
because these games are missing
a few components and this is,

105
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,560
this is what I think of when I'm
stoned playing world of Warcraft.

106
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,870
If I could smell like,

107
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:11,870
if there was a sense of smell involved
in this and also they've made it,

108
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,030
there was a sense of like,

109
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,170
I mean it's,

110
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,740
they've made machines that do that and
I don't think it's going to have to be a

111
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:18,574
mind thing.

112
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,260
It's a mind machine thing.

113
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,190
I think it's going to have to be,

114
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,830
so it's going to be a little
stimulate some part of your mind.

115
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,500
Maybe you can wear some,

116
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,120
maybe everyone's going to
have to shave their head.

117
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,320
Like real players.

118
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:29,970
The view,

119
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,803
you know,

120
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,840
you're going to have to do like a
horizontal Mohawk thing real plus I,

121
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,080
you know like this dude's legit,

122
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,981
he doesn't give a fuck.

123
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:36,600
It was up to club,

124
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,360
but this big stripe shaved on his head
and then you put this thing on skin to

125
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:41,850
skin on your head and it,

126
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:43,210
it has precise,

127
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:45,070
like you line it up on the video game,

128
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,250
it'll show you how to line
it up with the exact cortex,

129
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,630
exact portion of your brain.

130
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,630
And then it sends signals
that show you like burning,

131
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:53,001
meet,

132
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:53,621
smell,

133
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,620
and show you that.

134
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,420
And then,

135
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,580
but then you know what
else it does while you're,

136
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:01,030
and this is really weird while you're
playing the game and our races,

137
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,400
your memory of your previous life.

138
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,350
So the moment that thing goes on,

139
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,700
you'll have no more past your,

140
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,180
just the memories of the
character in the game,

141
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,160
rushing through the game,

142
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:12,971
playing the game,

143
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:17,110
completely unaware of the fact that
you used to exist as a person too.

144
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,370
And then you know what happens,

145
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,260
you're doing a podcast,

146
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,363
you're like,

147
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,240
oh fuck man,

148
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,440
my heart feels weird.

149
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,850
And you suddenly wake up and your
futuristic apart and you're like,

150
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,511
ah man,

151
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:29,590
that game was awesome.

152
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,510
So right now we're playing a game.

153
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:32,950
Yeah.

154
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,370
Like,

155
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:33,611
yeah,

156
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:37,000
like that with a lot of people say this
could be like some alien simulation,

157
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:41,380
you know that we're just an alien and
involved in a really high powered super

158
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,460
advanced bad ass video game
called planet experience.

159
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,340
The lives of billions of
people all individually.

160
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,460
I wrote something once about
maybe the life that we're living.

161
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:54,640
Maybe the reason why it seemed
so fake is cause it is fake.

162
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:59,110
And what we are in is some sort of a
reality simulation of the roaring twenties

163
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,370
of the technological age.

164
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,610
Like maybe we live in some time where
everything is all scented candles and

165
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:09,850
perfectly lit white rooms and no one has
a muscle car and no one's getting their

166
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,684
dick sucked.

167
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,471
And you know,

168
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:15,700
and maybe there's like a simulator that
you can run when you run where it's just

169
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:19,360
chaos but chaos that's
entertaining as fuck.

170
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,280
He's like every time you turn around
there's some new thing Christina Aguilar

171
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,120
fucking up the national anthem,

172
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,180
2 billion people tuning into the wedding.

173
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,270
There's constant shit going on to
keep you entertained and you are,

174
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,750
you are in this biological ride canister.

175
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,171
Yeah.

176
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,050
And you're going through this
thing and you're in this,

177
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:41,511
you're the,

178
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:45,700
you're a portal to this ride is
your skin and your flesh pops.

179
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:48,370
It pops through into this
dimension and you know,

180
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,650
it sounds like you're advocating fantasy.

181
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,330
It sounds like you're advocating,

182
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:52,900
well,

183
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,261
you know,

184
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:57,040
so you want to look at your life as
if it's some sort of a simulation.

185
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,340
Just live it as a simulation.

186
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,461
Yeah.

187
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:00,294
I'm saying yes I am.

188
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,680
Yeah,

189
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,131
why not?

190
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:01,311
Right.

191
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:02,360
It's very empowering.

192
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:02,750
Yeah.

193
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,060
I think the first person ever
heard suggest that was Mckenna.

194
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,220
I think Mckenna was talking about you.

195
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,133
How did he say it?

196
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,621
He was,

197
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:10,770
and he was quoting someone else.

198
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,350
So I'm doing a third hand quote,

199
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,710
but he said you should
view your life as he's,

200
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:17,544
say it

201
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,920
as a conspiracy or as view your life as
it's as it's as if the world is run by a

202
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:29,780
select group of people and that group
of people is you and your friends.

203
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,800
Yeah.

204
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:30,951
The,

205
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:31,281
your,

206
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:31,611
your,

207
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:36,050
your somehow or another secretly in
charge with running the world and running

208
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:38,080
the university and the most
important things in the university.

209
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:38,180
She,

210
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,090
you and your friends cause it's the
most empowering way to view the world.

211
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,041
Well yeah,

212
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,420
because what's the cause?

213
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:44,231
What's the other side?

214
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:48,160
The other side of it is this kind of like
pseudo empathy for like strangers that

215
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:48,701
you don't know.

216
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:53,140
Like so many people wander through
their day just frothing with terror or

217
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:54,520
whatever they've seen on the news.

218
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,470
And so for them the world's awful,

219
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,270
but then they're real situation
is usually pretty good.

220
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,970
You know,

221
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,640
like the,

222
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,850
it's like a fucking,

223
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,600
uh,

224
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,090
Bill Hicks has that
awesome joke about CNN,

225
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:10,390
CNN watch the news and then outside
it's like beautiful and the grass is

226
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:11,110
growing.

227
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,910
So there's this mental pollution that
comes pouring out of every information

228
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:17,080
device that we have.

229
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,820
And that like corrupts your mind and you
begin to think you're in a horror story

230
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:25,480
when your real reality is one
that's usually quite pleasant.

231
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,060
The,

232
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,940
that experience,

233
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:28,020
the [inaudible] experience,

234
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:28,950
the mushroom experience,

235
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,341
you know,

236
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:30,174
everybody,

237
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,970
everybody that is religious
wants to believe in God.

238
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,250
What I'm telling you is I can show you
something that represents God for sure.

239
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,140
You can meet what God is.

240
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,730
And I'm not saying it's God your meeting,

241
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:43,440
but you can meet what God is,

242
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,590
what God is is perfect and all knowing
and all embracing and loving and wise and

243
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,000
and constantly around you all the time.

244
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,680
Well when you take mushrooms,

245
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,700
that's what you feel.

246
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,631
That's what you feel.

247
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:55,740
You really feel God.

248
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:59,100
And I'm not saying that it is God that
you're communicating with or what God is

249
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:01,320
or what are the what
even the concept of God.

250
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:02,310
When you say God,

251
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,190
all of a sudden it's this male hierarchy,

252
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,720
a point of you know,

253
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:10,410
point of reference where you think
of like one alpha that controls all.

254
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,180
But it's not that God is
more like everything I,

255
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,340
it's like a super dimensional
glob of its efforts.

256
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:21,830
It's

257
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,700
an intelligence,

258
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:23,121
it's this,

259
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,080
it's always,

260
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,220
and also it's,

261
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:26,720
it's constantly changing.

262
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:27,710
That's the other thing like it's,

263
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,330
it's like trying to even talk about it.

264
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:32,480
It's like trying to talk about
like a spinning slot machine.

265
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:32,781
It's like,

266
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:37,220
it's constantly like morphing and
shifting and it's so fucking potent.

267
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,650
Whatever it is that we're runoffs of it.

268
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,680
Like when you see water running
down your windshield and like,

269
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,640
streams of water will break
into little globs of water.

270
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,511
That's what we are.

271
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:51,830
We're just little broken off globs of
superintelligence that have taken on these

272
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,800
personalities and think that
we're individuals and you
know what else breaks off

273
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,040
in that

274
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,873
fucking thing?

275
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,810
Elves,

276
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,080
hyper dimensional things that
aren't necessarily out to love you.

277
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:06,081
And like there really is like there
are beings out there that are,

278
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:06,954
um,

279
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,891
I don't know man,

280
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:09,660
like superintelligent toddlers,

281
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:11,040
I think Mckenna talked about it.

282
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:11,760
They're like,

283
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,620
they're like baby God or something.

284
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,370
Okay,

285
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,410
here's the devil's advocate point of view.

286
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,273
Please.

287
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,980
How do you not know that those thoughts,

288
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:24,750
those demons just represent thoughts
in your mind and perhaps what that

289
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:29,751
experience is entirely is you contacting
your own thoughts and ideas and dreams

290
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:35,310
and hopes and expression without the
context of reality attached to them.

291
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:35,611
Sure.

292
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:37,560
So without the idea of,

293
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:37,920
you know,

294
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,260
what you did that you're
embarrassed about,

295
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:44,640
that made you weird about your
underwear when you were 13 you know,

296
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:49,641
instead of that maybe it manifests itself
in almost a living thing and almost a,

297
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:53,760
you know that project you're seeing these
when you're saying you are beings out

298
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:54,630
there that are fucking with you,

299
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,240
maybe those are things that
you've let grow in your mind.

300
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:57,661
Well yeah,

301
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:00,990
I mean I think that that's the modern
take on it and I think that that's one

302
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,780
useful handle to like get her get,

303
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:04,470
get to,

304
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,030
to like grab a hold of an ideal.

305
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:07,610
I'd be considered that
when you were in there,

306
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:07,981
when you,

307
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:08,251
when you,

308
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:11,330
you said you had an experience where
like these are projection mechanisms but

309
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,031
this the yeah,

310
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:16,290
that what you're seeing literally is
like that thoughts are live there.

311
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,420
They're real things that they look,

312
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,010
you ever heard the possibility,

313
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:25,011
I mean the discussion rather of the idea
that aliens will come through the mind

314
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,630
and that they're not going to
manifest themselves in a real form.

315
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:31,350
And that when you think of the imagination
or when you think of dreams and what

316
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:32,610
we have is some weird,

317
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:36,030
slippery sort of experience that
we can't completely control.

318
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,880
But what if that dimension of dreams,

319
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:42,420
that sleep dimension that you tap into
when all your neurochemistry starts

320
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:45,600
flowing between the blood brain barrier
while you're in heavy rem sleep,

321
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,890
what does that is in fact,

322
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:49,290
another dimension would have
that is in fact a world.

323
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,810
And that is where aliens
will contact you through.

324
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,100
They will contact you through this
spiritual dimension instead of a physical

325
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:56,580
dimension.

326
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:56,880
Yeah.

327
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,031
Well,

328
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:57,870
if that's the case,

329
00:10:57,871 --> 00:11:00,300
and if you think about
taking mushrooms and these,

330
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,260
these l show up,

331
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,680
it is possible that negative things
that you've created in your own life,

332
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,400
shitty choices or bad energy that you've
set forth and then nurtured and and

333
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,880
repressed and put it down and tried to
deny it and all these different things

334
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:18,120
that people do to sort of rationalize
creepy things that they're doing in their

335
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:18,780
lives.

336
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,780
What if those things manifest themselves
as living organisms in the free pool of

337
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,624
your mind?

338
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,081
Yeah.

339
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:25,351
You know,

340
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,011
that's actually,

341
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:31,011
I think fucking Carl Young said that
exact same thing that you met Carl Young

342
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:31,854
this weekend.

343
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,930
I'm at a crazy guy who took ship 6.8
grams of mushrooms and told me he was Carl

344
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,763
Young.

345
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,660
This guy comes up to me and goes,

346
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,290
he goes,

347
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,640
I need to talk to you.

348
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,710
I have information that I'm
sure you don't know about it.

349
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:43,921
I go,

350
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:44,754
how can you be sure?

351
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,451
And he goes,

352
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:45,991
I just know.

353
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:46,441
I just know.

354
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:46,921
I just know.

355
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:47,880
I tried to talk to Brian,

356
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:48,571
read Ben about it,

357
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:50,760
but he replied to my email
with some stupid joke.

358
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,140
You go,

359
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,160
that sounds like Brian.

360
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,070
I want

361
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,970
to give you nuggets for that.

362
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,310
So that whole boy goes,

363
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,671
I really,

364
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:59,260
I've been doing psychedelic research.

365
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,580
I need to get this information for you.

366
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,270
I listen.

367
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,110
It's going to sound crazy.

368
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:03,280
I used to be in another life.

369
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:04,114
I was Carl Young.

370
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:04,991
I go,

371
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,860
how can you be sure?

372
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:06,881
And he goes,

373
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:08,320
I've seen things that you've never seen.

374
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:08,770
I go,

375
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,500
how can you know that this is ridiculous?

376
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,220
So you get to confidence
on get out of here.

377
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,890
I remember that guy have is,

378
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,550
do you remember?

379
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:15,701
Yeah,

380
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:16,780
I got to find that email.

381
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,040
That's crazy.

382
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,300
I talked about them on the podcast,

383
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:20,270
on a plane with Sam Aaa.

384
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:20,531
I did.

385
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,760
But that podcast might suck.

386
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:22,690
I'm not even going to release it.

387
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,410
I might not release it because we were
both hung over and tired and we're

388
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,590
talking about stupid shit.

389
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,630
So I'm not sure if I'm still hung over
from fucking Joey Diaz giving me a banana

390
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:31,960
cake.

391
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,111
Yeah,

392
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:35,590
I got a text from Brian in
capital letters do not eat.

393
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:37,510
Joey Diaz is banana bread.

394
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,300
You can never eat edible
marijuana that Joey Dee has given.

395
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:43,000
Know as you have xenon hand,

396
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,520
don't take that list.

397
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,160
You have a fucking big hypodermic filled
with adrenaline that you get stuff into

398
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:48,994
your chest.

399
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,363
Where vein?

400
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Oh Dude,

401
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:52,351
you,

402
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,890
Joey Diaz gave me a,

403
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,820
um,

404
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,480
once gave me like some breath strips I
guess is the first time I'd taken breath

405
00:12:58,481 --> 00:12:59,980
strips and he was like,

406
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,480
eat two of these.

407
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,670
And I'm like,

408
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:04,690
no,

409
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,381
he really tell you,

410
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:05,830
hey,

411
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,980
I don't tell anybody ever
detect more than a quarter.

412
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:09,971
I hold their hand.

413
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:10,151
I go,

414
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:10,481
dude,

415
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:11,230
listen to me Bro.

416
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:11,621
Listen to me.

417
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:12,250
I love you.

418
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,300
Don't take more than a quarter.

419
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,090
Joey likes the tour knowing Joey Diaz.

420
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,380
That's what I did.

421
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,790
I only took half of one of these knowing
him and I was driving home on the

422
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,070
interstate and uh,

423
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,671
was like,

424
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,180
well it's,

425
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,420
it's definitely the
apocalypse world is ending.

426
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,680
I see that clearly now.

427
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,990
I'm when the last days and uh,

428
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,243
and um,

429
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,330
there was a McDonald's and I was going
to stop my car and to the Mcdonald's to

430
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:40,060
get a burger because
traffic wasn't moving.

431
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:42,550
That's how bad the logic
was working in my mind.

432
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,990
I just get a fucking,

433
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,180
I know I can make it there
to get a diet coke and back.

434
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,650
But anyway,

435
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:48,191
I get home,

436
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:50,710
I'm having the most
terrible marijuana trip.

437
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm laying in bed.

438
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,361
I'm like,

439
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:52,960
oh my God,

440
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,790
the world's in my heart's
pounding phone rings,

441
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,253
phone rings,

442
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,093
Joey Diaz,

443
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:57,880
I answered.

444
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,360
He's like,

445
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,410
welcome to my house mother fucker.

446
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,770
So he's thought you took all two of them.

447
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,210
He knew the number you're
going to get a quarter.

448
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:11,044
Yeah.

449
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,380
Fuzzy.

450
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,180
Just surmise that he's so crazy.

451
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,560
My best buddies got the little Listerine,

452
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,640
the acid thing and there was like a few
of them in there and I guess they all

453
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:19,391
melted together.

454
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,141
Do you remember that?

455
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:20,740
I did that.

456
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,490
I did that once and the guy took
like a bunch of them ever did.

457
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,660
He never smoked weed.

458
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:26,830
You never eat wheat.

459
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:28,330
And he was like as first time trying it.

460
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,110
So Joey,

461
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,381
you know,

462
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:30,101
gave him some,

463
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:33,190
and there was like a lot in there and
they had melted together into one and you

464
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:34,370
got a massive panic attack.

465
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:37,300
I think the guy called an ambulance
call called nine one one you had a panic

466
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:37,780
attack.

467
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,201
Yeah,

468
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:38,561
we'd see.

469
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:39,101
That's the thing,

470
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:39,311
man.

471
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:43,030
There needs to be a special nine one
one like when you press a button on your

472
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:43,810
phone,

473
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,710
when you get directed,

474
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:44,980
like,

475
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,750
have you eaten edible marijuana?

476
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,360
Press Cherry Garcia.

477
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,710
Somebody can calm you down.

478
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,553
Yeah.

479
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,250
Okay.
