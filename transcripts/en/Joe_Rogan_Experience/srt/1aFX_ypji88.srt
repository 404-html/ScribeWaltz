1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,170
The joe rogan experience and I
can't think you enough Joe for uh,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,850
really sticking your neck out there.

3
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:06,600
And really,

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,230
I know you faced a lot of criticism
for your supportive psychedelics.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:11,980
Yeah,

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,191
no,

7
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:13,090
it's been pretty easy.

8
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:13,930
I'm going to be honest with you,

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm sitting here given this like heartfelt

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:22,650
but it,

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,770
but I did take you seriously that day in
the podcast when you told me mushrooms

12
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:29,550
could change the world and it really
planted a seed in my head which sprouted

13
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,970
this journey that I've been doing
around the world investigating these

14
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:33,750
medicines.

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,150
And that never would have happened.

16
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:36,720
My,

17
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:36,961
you know,

18
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,900
my life wouldn't be in
such the amazing state.

19
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,130
I feel like it is in now.

20
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:45,590
If it hadn't been for you
having the gumption to,

21
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,510
to talk about this and start
this dialogue is our country.

22
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,370
Cause psychedelics have been so taboo,

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,200
especially in the mainstream and I,

24
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,700
and I think you're really helping to
shift that consciousness nationwide.

25
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,400
I honestly don't think I am.

26
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:00,860
I think I'm just the whole thing itself.

27
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:01,990
It's very nice.

28
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,870
Tried to give me,

29
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,820
I don't deserve any credit,

30
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,290
nor do I want any.

31
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,461
I just,

32
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:08,240
um,

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,073
I,

34
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,700
I'm shocked that more people don't know
about the experiences and I feel a duty

35
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,430
because I've been there.

36
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:20,210
It's just like if you and your friends
were starving to death and you found some

37
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:21,080
food and the test and you're like,

38
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:21,381
guys,

39
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:21,681
come here.

40
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:21,951
Come here.

41
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:22,191
Come here.

42
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:22,731
I found the food.

43
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:23,564
I found the food.

44
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,490
Would you want all this
credit for finding that food?

45
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:25,731
No.

46
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:27,110
You'd want your friends to have the food.

47
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,273
That's how I feel.

48
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,851
I feel like,

49
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:29,570
uh,

50
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,403
you know what,

51
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,260
what we're all experiencing
right now is a wait,

52
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,160
what moment?

53
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,160
The whole coach culture is going,

54
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,381
wait,

55
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:36,531
wait,

56
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:36,681
wait,

57
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:36,890
wait.

58
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:37,570
What?

59
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:37,780
Wait,

60
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:37,940
wait,

61
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,091
wait,

62
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:38,241
wait,

63
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:38,750
wait a minute.

64
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,450
The NSA's listening to my fucking emails.

65
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,040
They're listening to my voicemails.

66
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,300
They're reading my emails.

67
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,650
I don't do anything wrong,

68
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:45,921
man.

69
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:46,251
Come on.

70
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:46,381
I'm,

71
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:46,441
I'm,

72
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:47,870
I'm a fucking insurance salesman.

73
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,440
And then,

74
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,131
and then people go,

75
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:49,281
wait,

76
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:49,431
wait,

77
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:49,551
wait,

78
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:49,701
wait,

79
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:49,821
wait,

80
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:49,970
wait.

81
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,240
What marijuana makes how much
in fucking taxes for Colorado?

82
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,960
They make how much for we know we're
running out of fucking money for schools

83
00:01:56,961 --> 00:01:58,340
and we could pay for that with weed,

84
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,060
but p and people are going to smoke
the same amount of weed anyway.

85
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,450
Statistically proven.

86
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,470
What the fuck is going on when they look
at [inaudible] we're going to go into

87
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:07,010
Syria.

88
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,211
Wait,

89
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:07,401
well,

90
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:07,641
well,

91
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:07,851
well,

92
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:08,121
well,

93
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:08,391
well,

94
00:02:08,391 --> 00:02:10,490
well what the fuck are we doing this?

95
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:10,911
Wait,

96
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:13,100
what moment is we're all a part of this?

97
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:13,341
Wait,

98
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,840
what moment you're a big part of this.

99
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:15,051
Wait,

100
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:19,570
what moment you're a big part of it by
they sticking your neck out about Bahrain

101
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,170
and about CNN and about,

102
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,531
you know,

103
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:23,780
working for a corporation
and being honest about it,

104
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,220
you,

105
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,441
you,

106
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:25,730
you stuck your neck out about it.

107
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,750
We're all just,

108
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,260
we're all forced into this reality.

109
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,520
We didn't ask to be here.

110
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:32,260
We were,

111
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,720
you know,

112
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:32,961
hey,

113
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:36,230
could you give birth to me so I can
grow up in the 21st century and fake?

114
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,040
No,

115
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,920
this is what you get.

116
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,010
Nobody asked you.

117
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,120
This is what you get.

118
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,870
And I think all of us realize that
that was the same for our far parents.

119
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,460
It was the same for our grandparents.

120
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,280
It was the same for everybody
and nobody hit the brakes.

121
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,650
Nobody had the wait what
moment where they went,

122
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:51,801
wait,

123
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:51,951
wait,

124
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:52,101
wait,

125
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:52,281
wait,

126
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:53,480
what the fuck are we doing?

127
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,250
Everybody just kept going and then had
heart attacks and died and taught a bunch

128
00:02:58,251 --> 00:03:02,710
of nonsense to their kids and they went
and they had heart attacks and died

129
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,030
teaching a bunch of nonsense to their
kids and then the internet came along and

130
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:07,511
that's the way,

131
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:08,830
what moment and the way,

132
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:09,431
what moment?

133
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:11,200
The real tipping point is people like you,

134
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:11,981
people like me,

135
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,480
people like anybody that's a part of the,

136
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:13,691
wait,

137
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,970
what moment doesn't like my new tee shirt?
