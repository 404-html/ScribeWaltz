1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,200
Like fucking robbed. And now look at
that. Um, live. Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:09,020
we are alive. We are here at the
compound, chillin with Eddie the twister.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,680
Bravo Shizam son. Welcome to
the podcast again, Mr Ravo, sir,

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,630
thank you for having me, man.
Thank you for being, it's,

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,650
it's an honor to be on the show sponsored
as always by the fleshlight and you

6
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:25,710
know, dudes giving me shit
about promoting this. And uh,

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,050
lately guys like woody was spokesman
from the flashlight while he was bring up

8
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:30,960
the flourish. Let your
podcast, first of all,

9
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,630
because the fleshlight is
actually sponsoring this pocket,

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,540
that fucking thing behind me. I forgot
how. Shut that off, man. First of all,

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,900
we never,
we never have something that doesn't fuck.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,230
Only twice we've ever done this where
we don't have sound going off in the

13
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:50,550
background. My computer has the, um, the
volume on, oh, my cat's in the room too.

14
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,930
That's also could be a mistake.
Yeah, I thought I kicked her out.

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,840
She's so needy.
She's an awesome cat,

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,680
but she's needy as fuck
when it comes to a podcasts.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,240
She doesn't give a shit about you
guys. Spazz go, go, go, go as fast.

18
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,540
Was that you or the cat? That was
fine. It was probably a cat. Anyway,

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,270
people have been giving me a hard time
saying like what are you a spokesperson

20
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:16,620
for the Po?
For the flashlight?

21
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,430
No I am not but they are sponsoring this
podcast and I'm here to tell you just

22
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:23,460
as a person who jerks off,
it's a fucking solid product.

23
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,030
It doesn't seem like it would be. It
seems like it's a silly thing. It's the,

24
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:28,560
but look,
you're going to jerk off.

25
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:32,730
Just accept that and it's like 50 bucks
or something like that and I think it's

26
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:36,540
like 15% off, 69 bucks, 69 bucks
and there was some of them vibrate.

27
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,510
They cross more. You don't need
that. What do you, a fucking robot.

28
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,120
The vibration probably would
not be the best on that day.

29
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,530
How much distance in a that would work.

30
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:48,510
It's just a dude who buys like extras
who will want it loaded. Loaded.

31
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,330
It's like in the 60 60
bucks and it's like 50% off.

32
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:55,080
So for like 70% off for other,
for like another 15 bucks for the wig.

33
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,570
You're talking about 75 bucks total.
Well,

34
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:00,280
Brian's been stuff in them and
couches and fucking them. Yeah.

35
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,770
You put them in between the two.

36
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,570
I did that with a towel once
you take a a plastic bag, uh,

37
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,740
a friend of mine, we both know
him. Uh, he's a cartoonist. Oh,

38
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,330
tell that you get a plan.

39
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,900
You put a towel out and then you put a
plastic bag on it and then you roll up

40
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:19,530
the towel, right. And then it's
like a Burrito and then you make,

41
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,110
you just put some,
you know,

42
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,440
some guy has a youtube tutorial on
how to make your own fleshlight.

43
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,150
He makes it really, yeah, it looks
super complicated. But the bottom line,

44
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,360
that's like, how much time is
your time worth? An hour. Okay.

45
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,830
Is it worth 20 bucks an hour?

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,830
It's going to take you more
than three hours to make
that gut. Just buy it. Right?

47
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,731
You don't want to be cool.
You know,

48
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:43,320
it'd be awesome if you were so tight and
so cool with your housekeeper that you

49
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:46,890
didn't even have to clean it. You can just
leave it out by like 20 of them. Right.

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,480
You buy like 20 of them and then she
cleans for you. Right. That would be dope.

51
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,060
Then I would use that
shit all the goddamn time.

52
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,840
Me and my housekeeper just saying we
ain't that tight yet. Yeah, that, no,

53
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,190
no housekeeper wants to be cleaning loads.
That's where they draw

54
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,840
the line. How cool would it be? Seriously.

55
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,610
That would be cool if you could
just throw it like underwear.

56
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:04,960
You know when you just
leave your shit everywhere.

57
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,660
You know your housekeepers coming
on Wednesday. You know what I mean?

58
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,130
It'd be cool, man. Then I would definitely
use it. I buy it wholesale and shit.

59
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,780
That's like, somebody told
me the other day, it's like,

60
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:18,130
don't you know that we'd stores or like
a way for the government to get involved

61
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,100
and take your money. I'm like, dude, I
can use a credit card and be in and out.

62
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,070
You know? That's why. Who cares if
the government gets a piece of it.

63
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,970
Who the fuck told you the government's
involved in the West because of credit

64
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:28,340
card?

65
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,220
Well that is the number one problem with
hanging out with people that smoke pot.

66
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,570
Is there so many dopey stoners
that have like crazy ideas?

67
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,820
The latest is that this Gulf
disaster is um, all the,

68
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,760
the wacky are saying that this was a
planned event and that they're doing this

69
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:49,120
to use it as an excuse to kill off a
giant percentage of the population.

70
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,510
Is Alex Shelan saying that too?
He said we need to get to them.

71
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,940
We need to get to the bottom of it.
He's got to have black helicopters.

72
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:55,511
Ladies and gentlemen.

73
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:58,540
What they're doing right now in the Gulf
mirrors what they're trying to do in

74
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,580
our school systems. They're
trying to take your guns. Did,

75
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:04,180
if you ever had a cartoon,
if you ever had a cartoon,

76
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:07,750
you would have to have the Alex Jones
be a character in the Joey d is because

77
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:10,630
those two are almost perfect,
like identical.

78
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:14,200
You could totally have the best
I can do Alex. Really good.

79
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:16,690
If I listen to them when I listened
to him, ladies and gentlemen,

80
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,000
I get the tones of the voice.

81
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:23,470
I understand what the new world
order is plotting and it's evil.

82
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,250
It's wrong.
What is they're coming for your babies.

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,430
They want to put implants in your uterus.

84
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,050
What does Joey think about the oil spill?

85
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,510
What the fuck are you bothering me
with this oil spill bullshit. Listen,

86
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,000
cock sucker.
I got no time.

87
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,700
I've got 10 cats and the weed store is
open at 9:00 AM. You know what I'm saying?

88
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,360
I get down there. I get my
old g Kush. I say, hello.

89
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,260
Maybe I have some fresh squeezed orange
juice and I mind my fucking business.

90
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,640
This was asked, this was asked on my
form of spring that I just started.

91
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,690
Cannabis clubs are one of the biggest
capitalist money making schemes that have

92
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:02,530
ever come around in 15 years. Why is
this never called out? Why is that? Well,

93
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:05,470
what does that mean? Capitalist money
making schemes. Okay. First of all,

94
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,870
the one that I go to that
Joe was just shut down.

95
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,870
What's shut was owned by
a guy who's a businessman,

96
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:14,500
who's a nice guy who took a chance on
something that's very controversial,

97
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,360
like opening up a marijuana store and he
provides good service and he has loyal

98
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:23,050
customers because he's a friendly guy
and they always give you like free joints

99
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:25,510
and everything. When you leave here,
try these cookies, they're awesome.

100
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,460
They're super nice and super friendly.

101
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,970
And it was a privately owned business
by one guy. This guy's full of shit. I,

102
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,600
this guy was providing me
with an awesome service.

103
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,190
He was selling great.

104
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:40,060
We'd all legally doing
everything according to
California state law by the book,

105
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:42,910
every single aspect of it.
And he had a nice business going.

106
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,860
We're at a bunch of people
that were like loyal business.

107
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,010
There's nothing that government has
nothing to do with that. I mean,

108
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,220
no more than the government has to do
with me telling jokes because look,

109
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,800
if I'm telling jokes, you know,
if I'm getting paid to do comedy,

110
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,030
I got to pay taxes.

111
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,520
So when a sense when you go to see my
act support the government, you know,

112
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,200
I mean really in a sense,
you know,

113
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:04,580
I pay the government a ton of money
every year it comes 48% or something like

114
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:05,570
that of your,
your money.

115
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,160
It goes literally to taxes supporting my
government by drinking is coconut water.

116
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,720
Yeah. Well he's launching a certain
amount of fucking government folks. Okay.

117
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,980
Don't worry about, you know where the
money from pot stores is going. All right.

118
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:23,981
Worry about the massive impact that
marijuana being that accessible and

119
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:28,220
basically legal, the massive impact
that that has on our culture.

120
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,840
It's only been going on for a few years
and I've noticed a giant difference in

121
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,320
just how many people are more aware.

122
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,210
How many more people are, are just
like aware of like the legality of it.

123
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,920
Why, why it's illegal, what
the, you know what the,

124
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:47,150
the whole conspiracy was with William
Randolph Hearst back in the 30s.

125
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,510
So many more people are informed
and people aren't afraid of anymore.

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,160
It's not like people think that
it's going to give you brain damage.

127
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,440
Just going to fuck your world up.

128
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,170
Like people understand now that that's
bullshit and they're starting to realize

129
00:06:57,171 --> 00:07:01,020
that it can enhance your life.
That's so fucking important, man.

130
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,270
Fuck all this government conspiracy.
The biggest capital is making scheme.

131
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,850
Everyone don't look at that.
Stop. You're being silly.

132
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,760
You're looking for a negative
in something that's incredible.

133
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,870
Marijuana's finally broken through
and I can tell you from California,

134
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,670
it's crazy. You can go anywhere.
There's weed stores. My,

135
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,260
my place got closed down because
it's too close to a school,

136
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,430
but I put an article on my, uh, on
Twitter and I put an article or you know,

137
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:28,220
I put a post on Twitter and I put
a post on a message board, hey,

138
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,280
where are the good places in the
valley in California and fucking,

139
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:34,030
I got dozens of suggestions.
Like instantly that's,

140
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,100
there's never been a time like this
ever. I like my place. Check it out.

141
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,410
It's just a house.
It's like a suburban neighborhood.

142
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:43,840
What's your face going to
Luca? Late collective. Oh,
you took me there once. Yeah.

143
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,520
That place is cool. Yeah, no, that
place is very good. It is like a house,

144
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,640
like you go in little little picket fence,
front yard and shit was kind of weird.

145
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:53,810
The Best Shit is med pot delivery.com
have you ever thought that? I done,

146
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,420
I've already used them. Now
what's the negative? My mother,

147
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,360
I needed weed and this
motherfucker came to my house.

148
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:00,620
The negatives is that illegal?

149
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,150
The negatives and some dude who delivers
pot knows where you live? No. No.

150
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,150
Oh, okay. You actually bought weed from
him before. Which guys? His name is Brett.

151
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,500
He trains that.
I'm in Culver city with a Gerson.

152
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,280
He's a bog Gracie guy. We know him. Okay.
You remember that guy? Yeah. Really good.

153
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:23,700
So now the Shit Med
pot. Oh Dude. But yeah,

154
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,131
that is correct.

155
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:29,570
Like if you were thinking like out
of this cloud you would say, Hey,

156
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:33,500
this guy is in the drug business and
he's in my house checking my shit out.

157
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,870
You know, that's Kinda, you
could look at it that way,

158
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:39,320
but would you be bothered if a guy
came over with a delivery of fine wine?

159
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,510
You wouldn't [inaudible] guy came over
your house and he had some really nice

160
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,730
expensive French wine.
That guy's a drug dealer.

161
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,710
Well I would never let
him in my house like,

162
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,710
like I don't let me pee he ups guy
but I would have to let them eat that.

163
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,040
The weed guy in my house.
Cause you're

164
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,590
not going to just break out.
No.

165
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,470
You would know why not if it's legal
because I have my neighbors don't care if

166
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:04,650
it's legal. They think, oh this guy's
doing drugs on the front porch neighbors.

167
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,890
My neighbors can suck my Dick
Button from your neighbor.

168
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:10,460
You could roll down the hill and you
still don't hit your neighbors. Yeah,

169
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:12,360
but if I did,
even if I did have neighbors,

170
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:13,950
your neighbors should do
who the fuck you are, man.

171
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,040
You worried about getting a bag of weed
and from your neighbors. That's crazy.

172
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,440
Yeah.
Well they also own the place.

173
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:22,090
So I think if a guy came over your
house and deliver a nice case won,

174
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,943
you'd let them right in.

175
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,980
You let them run it in a role that
little dolly right into your kitchen like

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,360
dumb.
Fuck some wine.

177
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,020
I lost my fucking button up shirt.
It's trust me. It's hilarious.

178
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,460
I just met with someone
with that mentality.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,820
I mean once a drug is a drug,

180
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,380
it's responsible for so
much art and culture and so
much of the way human beings

181
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:51,040
behave. You know, alcohol based societies,
any alcohol based society, they're there.

182
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,000
It's like, you know when
societies getting into alcohol,

183
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:59,001
it's always like violence and yelling and
lots of fun and passion and poetry and

184
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:04,650
music and shit like that. Next weed
and alcohol together. That's the past.

185
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,580
Isn't it funny though that you'd never
think of wine as a drug but nobody thinks

186
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:12,220
of why like I do drugs. What kind
of drug you do? I do. One was,

187
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:15,510
this certificate is not to be trusted.
I don't know what that's going on.

188
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,400
I think my Twitter is crashing. My girl,
ex girlfriend used to always say that.

189
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,480
She's always said that wines, that
drug, that a certificate, nevermind.

190
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,920
Oh there's nobody knows what
we're talking about here.

191
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,070
Twitter is going to be there.

192
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,910
It's going nutty and I'm going
to just going to shut it off.

193
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,820
Shut off the youth stream though. No,
no, no. I'm not shut off shut anyway. Um,

194
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,230
wine is a drug. It really is.
Nobody thinks about, always
forget that, that, that,

195
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,410
that alcohol is a drug and everybody,
especially with walnut time,

196
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,100
wine seems like something, you know, you
have, if you're sophisticated, you know,

197
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,400
it's like the most, the most accepted.
Like if you tell people you smoke weed,

198
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,200
there's a lot of people that look at
you like there's something wrong with,

199
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,140
you don't want to read that shit
sometimes. But then you get like,

200
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,900
you get like wine in a box
and that's just like, man,

201
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:02,480
this is like cool laid for alcohol. Did
you know $5 I got a whole box of alcohol.

202
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,390
Thank you though. There's nothing worse
than some shitty wine, man. I agree.

203
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,810
What do you think Mel Gibson was
drinking when he made those calls?

204
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,510
What was he drank? Can
we hear him? If we don't,

205
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,740
if you don't know what
we're talking about.

206
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,840
Mel Gibson apparently lost
his fucking marbles. He's
got this chick who, uh, he's,

207
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:22,350
uh, I mean he was married for a
number of years and has, uh, you know,

208
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:26,000
quite a few kids with
and he left her and uh,

209
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,780
this is the new chick
that he hooked up with.

210
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,250
I think it's more than alcohol though.

211
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:32,550
I think this is just straight like what
she was saying. Crazy person. Yeah.

212
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,180
But you would know. This is what
I've always told people about actors,

213
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,430
like actors are really annoying.

214
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,690
And one of the things that's so annoying
about them is they really are like you,

215
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,730
you, you have to be crazy
to want to be an actor.

216
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,950
You have to be crazy to get
through all those hoops.

217
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,120
And there's a lot of them that are cool.

218
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,070
I'm in a lot of actors that are
really fun to hang around with,

219
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:53,980
but for the most part, a giant
percentage of them are fucking completely

220
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,550
insane.

221
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,080
And the business coddles to them because
the business has kindly like kind of,

222
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,661
uh,
they're,

223
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:02,260
they're like always like getting them
food and kissing their ass and Mr. Gibson

224
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:05,710
will be ready for you in 20 minutes and
he's making so much money and he's the,

225
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:08,410
you know, the focus of all these people's
attention and love and adulation.

226
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:11,350
These movies are giant, you know,
passion that Christ is giant.

227
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,340
And so that just blows your fucking ego
up even more, you know? And most of them,

228
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,850
like a good percentage of them
are really truly insane. You know,

229
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:21,520
a good percentage of actors are,
they're totally delusional.

230
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,390
But we're starting to see that now
because of these, all of these sources,

231
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:28,600
these TMZ places and stuff like that,
we get to see someone's true personality.

232
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,600
They catch them draw coming out of a
nightclub and you get a camera on him.

233
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,620
All this shit that's going on right now
when you're getting to see like deep

234
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:39,580
behind the curtain Twitter, I mean,
shit, you know, you got some time.

235
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:44,080
There's a lot crazy ass celebrities,
I swear to God and couple of fighters.

236
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,910
Oh man, that there, it's growing
machine has an awesome tour falling,

237
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:52,300
falling apart in front of the world.
You know, it's, it's incredible.

238
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:54,790
So I'm a loving, very entertaining. Yeah,

239
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,770
there's definitely people that
are losing their fucking shit.

240
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,070
There's a lot of people out there
doing Twitter that really should not be

241
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:04,180
allowed to talk. You shouldn't be allowed
to be just talking publicly. Yeah.

242
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,290
Handle you man. Like whoever, whoever's
handling Brittany Spears right now,

243
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,350
they've got it wired for years.
This wasn't an issue.

244
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,200
People are going to have publicists
and he could say stupid shit and,

245
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,190
and you know, and nobody, nobody cared.
Nobody ever found out about it all.

246
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,040
Think about all the crazy scandals that
have happened throughout history and how

247
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,010
much they would be much more in
the news today than ever before.

248
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,570
And we'll think about the rod Stewart
pumping the stomach rumor level that,

249
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,720
that was like early eighties when we
talked about this before. The Jabil rumor,

250
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,900
the Richard Gere Djerba rumor.
That's the world champ before Twitter,

251
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,950
before the Internet, he imagined that
shit. That is the world champion rumor.

252
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,810
No rumor can fuck with that.

253
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:46,870
Richard Greer durable up the ass for
or cause there was nothing, nothing.

254
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:51,220
There was no CD television shows and
talked about it. There was no internet.

255
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,970
It's somehow or another made it. He grew
up in California. I grew up in Boston.

256
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,450
We both heard it. Yep. That one and that
stomach pumping rod Stewart, Taco Bell's,

257
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,650
uh, survived the sour cream come
rumor. And I still even wild.

258
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,140
I've never even heard this guy
got busted working at Taco Bell.

259
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,570
He just came in a bunch of Tacos. He used
to do it for two months, blah, blah, blah.

260
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:14,900
It's dry. And that was a rumor only in
your town. That shit didn't make it.

261
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,270
That happens.
That's like portal is food.

262
00:14:20,271 --> 00:14:22,820
We're talking about a human beings.
Life is ruined.

263
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,010
I don't put human beings in my mouth
unless I could stop eating tacos and you

264
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:30,350
wouldn't have to worry about that guy.
You don't stop being Richard Gere.

265
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,980
What are the two? What are the biggest,
what are the two biggest rumors?

266
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:38,981
Pre Internet having common loads and sex.

267
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:42,460
Gay Sex.
[inaudible]

268
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,060
I don't give a fuck what anybody
says. What about the George? Michael.

269
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,070
Remember the George Michael Thing?
Was that before the Internet?

270
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,620
What was that same with with the cops.

271
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,920
I mean there was a boy who was a
meager intern. There was a little,

272
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:56,500
it was not the kind of culture.
That's how everybody had an AOL.

273
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,630
You know my space. Yeah.
It wasn't like that was,

274
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,520
I watched careless whisper today on
Youtube. George Michael, careless whisper,

275
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,530
do it click.
I think you'll open that shit up.

276
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:12,040
You went to first year this Mel Gibson,
careless whisper. First they were little.

277
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,200
Mel Gibson. Let's go. Let's go
positive first. That negative

278
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,330
careless whispers, George Michaels
and it's all talking about the videos.

279
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:21,940
Him and he's dancing.
He's with a girl,

280
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:23,660
so I'll talk about him and a
girl breaking out. It's a great,

281
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:27,470
but there's a scene where he has to kiss
the girl. Why did you want it today? Why?

282
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,430
Because it's fascinating.
Was this during fleshlight time,

283
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,790
you're like Sumit on his face,
like with some crazy FBI.

284
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,310
CIA stopped and you see
right when he kept his eyes,

285
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,430
his eyes rolled back, but
it's just something about
the, even the words were gay.

286
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,480
It wasn't just gay, the way he
dressed and looked and you know,

287
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,620
maybe he did it except it guilty feed.
I've got no rhythm.

288
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:01,220
No, I'm never gonna dance again.
Guilty feed have got no rhythm.

289
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,640
What heterosexual man would be
willing to say that I've done

290
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,270
guilty feet.
I've got no rhythm.

291
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,890
Jyoti feed of what the fuck are you
talking? Oh you got it hooked up Brian

292
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,440
to the soundboard on the fly. Like
write news and gentlemen, tech support.

293
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:22,940
Extraordinary Brian Redman
Reichle and everything about him.

294
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,830
He's so like feminine, like beautiful,
handsome man. His hair is fabulous.

295
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,040
You know,
striking features only.

296
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,780
Only gay people like saxophone and songs.
If George Michael was strange,

297
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,760
he could do so much damage.

298
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,830
If he says straight aggressive man with
those looks and the fucking voice to the

299
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:45,830
ads, you know what kind of damage that
motherfucker could have done. Facial hair,

300
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,590
God, everything. The whole
package. Beautiful Man,

301
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,260
sad.
Listen to this

302
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,160
guilty feed.
I've gotten over the cut son.

303
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,240
You're gay and you're
white, gay, guilty feet.

304
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,260
You've got no rhythm.

305
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,460
Fantastic music of the 80s all right.
Now that's positive and that's all good.

306
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,460
And now what we have to talk
about ladies and gentleman,

307
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,120
something that's not so
positive and not so good.

308
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:22,670
We've got to play this buck and Mel Gibson
clip. Can you cause you need to know,

309
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,270
tell me when to positive
if this was a gay thing,

310
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,810
like a gay relationship. That's
the next, that's the next one.

311
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,800
Going to be a Ted Haggard. Ted Haggard
banned me from fucking Twitter man.

312
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,370
God dammit. What? He
blocked me. I'm so mad.

313
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:40,820
I want to see you are about all
the time I was enjoying it and uh,

314
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,020
no it was because of a comment.

315
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:45,050
I think he probably has heard my bit
before but he probably didn't know it was

316
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:47,600
following them. I mean I would
assume if he's got, if he's online,

317
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:52,410
someone probably sat on my bed but he's
um, anyway, he wrote on his Twitter,

318
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,550
he goes after Sunday, you know, um,

319
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,670
Bible study sandwiches and
then.dot, dot. Question Mark.

320
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,830
So I wrote math and blow jobs.
Question Mark, my response.

321
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,720
And so he blocked me and fucking very
upset man. Cause it was fascinating.

322
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,570
Reading is Twitter now. I have to, I
could still watch read it though, Dude,

323
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,940
you can't totally block me.
I'll just go in through a web browser.

324
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,900
The old block c on your iPhone though
doesn't it only blocks you on whatever

325
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:20,880
application using tweetdeck
or Twitter or whatever.

326
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:22,980
It doesn't do it on the weapon.
He could go right to the website.

327
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,260
Remember that was how our
friend did not know that.

328
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:29,220
We knew that he was saying some fucked
up shit. Right. Totally unrelated thing.

329
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:29,690
But,

330
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,500
but so I still get to read and take
into goodness that is the Ted Haggard

331
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,850
Twitter.
If you don't know Ted Haggard,

332
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:40,851
his famous evangelist that turned out
was actually smoking math and having gay

333
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:45,330
sex with hookers, all these gay
hookers. And he was like a huge,

334
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:47,910
like I'm a spokesperson
for the religious right.

335
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,670
Used to have conference calls
weekly with George Bush,

336
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,040
what they would talk about, you
know, such things as, you know,

337
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:57,060
promoting Christianity and stopping the
gauge. And then it was just a crazy homo.

338
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,840
That sounds like a sitcom.

339
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,980
Like that dude's life is a sitcom.
He's married, he's got kids. He's,

340
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,910
but he's not gay, but he said cooker
on the side just to pay the bills.

341
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,730
Oh my.
And Ted Haggard is one of his customers.

342
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,360
When that got busted,
what did he feel like?

343
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,490
How did that feel to get caught?
Like with the

344
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,350
video taped it like real clear quality,

345
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,870
hello job. That's probably what he
wanted to know. Wanted to get high.

346
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,460
That's probably what this whole thing was.
I mean,

347
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,050
he probably got caught and start twisting
his nipples by what's happening in the

348
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:41,750
cops know that.

349
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,880
Yeah, he probably, I think Eddie's
right, but I also think that when you,

350
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,680
when you're hiding that much,

351
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:53,460
I think the pressure is so hard that
you almost want to get caught to end it.

352
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,910
I think the pressure of like
having that big of a secret,

353
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,610
you're this Christian
religious evangelists,

354
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:02,840
that's like a public speaker
who's revered by the,

355
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:07,110
the Christian movement and meanwhile
you're smoking crystal meth and sucking a

356
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:11,450
guy's ass hole. You know, you're, you're
following. I know that. Yeah, no, no.

357
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,480
The guy was very explicit.
Not all guys suck ass or no.

358
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,140
The hooker and the hooker was very,
very open about it.

359
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:22,260
He talked about the rectum.
They get freaky. I don't know.

360
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:25,890
I don't remember. I might be
talking about my ass right there.

361
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,090
I don't remember the exact details.

362
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:28,680
I remember he was talking
about having gay sex.

363
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,700
There's stuff he actually mentioned
sucking blame checks and who don't really

364
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:33,630
like to suck.
Dick.

365
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,200
I wonder if there's like a lame gay
dudes who they don't really like to look

366
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:40,150
assholes and I'm sure.
Just give me a little selfish

367
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,290
hope as gay dude. I was on some
mate. Your flicks last night.com.

368
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,040
It's just like youtube for porn.
And there

369
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,120
was this one video where this hot chick
had this nasty boyfriend and she was

370
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:56,540
just like, this is home amateur video.
Just fucking eating his ass. I want to,

371
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,630
you know, it's like, it's like crazy.

372
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:02,170
Like how do you get to that point where
you're like, dude, it's right there.

373
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,920
Never had a chick flick your ass, Huh?
Yeah. But it was by mistake kind of.

374
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,160
It wasn't like
Shit's going to lick your ass.

375
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,970
You, you can't, there was a
very funny episode of sex.

376
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,770
She came out that very funny episode of
Sex and the city where a guy wanted to

377
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:20,420
get his ass lick and he was like,

378
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,070
when he licked her ass and he was
like trying to like lean his, her,

379
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,130
his ass towards her face.
And I like it.

380
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,650
Yeah. I don't know what, what do you,

381
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,140
why do you think porn is going in such
a crazy direction or people spiral

382
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,150
spiraling out of control?
I mean the amount of like fucked up porn,

383
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:40,970
it's available today. It must
be like 10,000 times. What?

384
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:44,450
It wasn't the eighties
more even there was,

385
00:21:44,451 --> 00:21:47,690
it was very hard like in the 1980s to get,
I think it's just technology.

386
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,840
They got one mouth fucks,
you know like smacks,

387
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,940
beaten chick checks up and nothing in
their eyeballs and there's like so much

388
00:21:55,941 --> 00:22:00,730
nutty shit that's online like
aggressive, like violent porn. Yeah.

389
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,843
So much more.

390
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,670
It's more people have cameras and
internet connections and what that,

391
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:09,671
what it is and I think people are numb
to the regular shit and things like porn

392
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,380
and the obsession with porn
accelerates just like technology.

393
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,120
It just gets crazier
and crazier and crazier.

394
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:16,880
Crazier because there's a lot of like
porn that you used to watch when you were

395
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:20,720
a kid that you know wouldn't even get
you excited. Now it'd be boring as fuck.

396
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,550
You just get so desensitized. You want
that high resolution closeup. Shit.

397
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,670
1,008 did porn and three d. What's
the latest on that? Who knows? I know,

398
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:34,540
but you went here. Mel Glitzy. Yeah. Let's
go to Mel Gibson before we go into porn.

399
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,930
All right, here's the, here's the
big call. This is the first one.

400
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:40,190
This is I think the second one,

401
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:44,300
but this is like if you don't know Mel
Gibson has this check and the check is is

402
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:48,800
a baby mamma and she's got his daughter
and so Mel Gibson is calling her and

403
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,020
they're having a
conversation over the phone.

404
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,930
The chicken is secretly taping it and
it's fucking crazy. All right, here we go.

405
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,243
Okay.

406
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,060
Don't hang up on me.
You gotta make this much louder,

407
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,810
Brian. This is really low. All right.

408
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,640
I don't know if this
is going to work folks.

409
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,140
You know when it was better than that,

410
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,710
it was better when you had the microphone
and you put it right over the youtube

411
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,040
again.
We're going to try a different way folks,

412
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,050
cause I think this recording
is just a little too low.

413
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:22,920
I don't think it's good to the mic. That's
the way we did it before. It's louder.

414
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,980
That's the thing. Give us one
second here, ladies and gentlemen,

415
00:23:25,981 --> 00:23:27,270
we apologize for the delay,

416
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,910
but
you got to Brian.

417
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,520
Yeah, now it's just downloading the video.
It's, I mean it's gonna take a second.

418
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,840
Yeah. To about bringing a
little bit, a lot of it.

419
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,950
Why did it stop Goddamn Internet.

420
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,400
Okay. Right. When you think you've got
to figure it out. Don't hang out with me.

421
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,810
I have plenty of energy to drive
over there. You understand me?

422
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,120
So just listen to me.
Listen to like,

423
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,550
I didn't do anything to you.

424
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,580
You are ruining my life.

425
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,030
Fucking difficult. Well, you know what?

426
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,920
It's your supports me
instead of chuck taught me,

427
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,530
I just fucking sucked me dry.
What

428
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:27,300
do love me?
What am I?

429
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,930
Oh shit
relationship.

430
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,050
Listen to me as somebody
who loves does not behave.

431
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,440
I know like this because I know
everyone says that you cannot let me and

432
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,030
every time no consideration to
reject it or be happy. Fuck.

433
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,500
Get the fuck away from me,
but my daughter.

434
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,420
That's nice.
I'll get you one more time.

435
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,740
Damn.
You care about that yourself.

436
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,240
I did not do anything.
This is your selfish imagination.

437
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,133
That's okay.

438
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,360
I'm sleeping with the baby.
I'm waking up every two hours.

439
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,540
I still asleep because I was waiting for
you because you weren't ready to go to

440
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,680
Jacuzzi as we reach.

441
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,890
Yup. We agreed. Agreed.

442
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,230
You just fucking expect shit go.

443
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,300
I thought it got down to commit
to yourself to go with you

444
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,373
because

445
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,033
I

446
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,550
left my wife because we had
no spiritual common ground.

447
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,703
Okay.

448
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,790
No fucking dude,
because you heard me so bad.

449
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,060
I didn't want to see normally whether
it be you didn't go do anything.

450
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,683
Oh really?

451
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,080
I want it to peace.
I want it to happen.

452
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,420
No. For me, I didn't.

453
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,760
I feel that bad and be patronized by

454
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,170
dishonesty and meditation.

455
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,450
Medicaid, no god, but

456
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,100
God damn life,
miserable

457
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,823
medication

458
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,500
sampling.
Fuck a little girl with,

459
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,780
I'm fucking dysfunctional

460
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,760
fucking side of the head,
right.

461
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,620
Judy does Dr
Brain transplant.

462
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:01,930
Fucking
I need medication

463
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,400
because I fucking bend over backwards
with eye balls of and not just do it all

464
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,900
for it. She gives me like I'm
fucking sour. Look or say,

465
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,613
hold on.

466
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,190
You know care about me.
I have no hard time,

467
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,210
bitch.
You fucking bitch.

468
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,630
Don't hang up on me.
Listen to this anymore.

469
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,740
Hang up coming over there.

470
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:01,080
You fucking, I'm coming to
my house. My house. Honey.

471
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,180
Yes, but you honey. Don't call me honey.

472
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,760
You just
call the police and tell them there.

473
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,783
How about that?

474
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,010
You can do that.
That's fine.

475
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,490
Fuck you.
I don't blog.

476
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,620
I wrote by the policeman anything
because I stand up for myself. Yo,

477
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,310
your week you'll call a fucking cop

478
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,210
and that will go to Lsu is right.

479
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,300
Well don't you fuck off.
Did I

480
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,850
fucking making eyes at me in five seconds.

481
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:38,350
Five seconds.
She's not your brand,

482
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,870
your fucking friend who took me.

483
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,860
How would he friends?

484
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,483
Come on.

485
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,470
That's fucking actors.
This is what I'm talking about.

486
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,860
When I first moved to California and
I first started working with actors,

487
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:11,320
I couldn't believe how
crazy so many of them were.

488
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,460
There's a lot of crazy motherfuckers
that just know how to act normal when

489
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:18,800
they're being interviewed during
press junkets and you know,

490
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:22,010
and I figured out a way he can save his
career. The black shut the fuck up. No,

491
00:30:22,011 --> 00:30:26,680
no seriously. That is all viral videos
for a movie coming out. It'd be brilliant.

492
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,860
It would be brow crazy viral
video for a movie about a,

493
00:30:30,861 --> 00:30:34,630
an obsessive rich guy who's taking
care of a Russian whore and we mean,

494
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,450
I mean it's going to get worse.
Yeah,

495
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,610
that's a great idea for a movie that's
going to get worse comes over. She,

496
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,590
that's actually a great idea for a movie.

497
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:45,470
You get a girl from a country like Russia,
which you know, it's poor and they,

498
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,490
they, there's a lot of women over
there that are fucking beautiful man.

499
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,570
Stunningly beautiful. But we
got like a hardness to them,
right? So she comes over,

500
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:54,520
she decides, all right, I'm going
to let this rich guy, fuck me.

501
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,560
I'm going to make a ton of money and just,
you know,

502
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,890
just deal with it and deal with him
and he just becomes fucking crazy.

503
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,990
And He's like a giant
movie star like Mel Gibson.

504
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,660
You know what movie was kind of like that?
That hasn't even come out yet.

505
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:07,330
Remember without dude. What
was that? Joaquin Phoenix.

506
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:10,630
I started growing the beard and going
crazy and then I keep, that's a movie.

507
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:15,400
Is He doing that for movies? Viral
bullshit. That's what I've always thought.

508
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,090
I was wondered what the other day
did he go on Conan?

509
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:23,590
Is he like gave up acting east and
then he had all these like television

510
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:25,570
appearances where he
acted crazy and stuff.

511
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:29,980
That was like a film I just found out
recently and I thought that from day one

512
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:31,870
I'm like, this is bullshit. That is not,

513
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,920
why is he on Conan if he's going crazy and
quitting acting, you know? Right, right,

514
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:39,820
right. That's fascinating. So hopefully
Mel Gibson who was supposed to come out,

515
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,330
I don't know. I just a couple of weeks
ago I heard about it. It was like,

516
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:46,810
like a document mockumentary there's a
few dudes that can just act their fucking

517
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:48,190
ass off. There's, you know,

518
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:51,220
there's a few dudes where I
really appreciate the craft
and what they're doing.

519
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:55,640
Like a Gary Oldman. He's one of them.
Walk Jakeem. How, how'd you say it?

520
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,530
[inaudible] he's one of them to that
motherfucking could act as ass off.

521
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,910
He did Johnny Cash. Perfect.
Perfect. That's a flux.

522
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,770
Blueray must blueberry. It must be. I
got it on my Mel Gibson. A great actor.

523
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,570
Fuck you. Fuck you. Because he's
crazy as fuck. Back in the day, dude.

524
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:14,590
The Mad Max days.

525
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,560
Who the fuck would have been a better
mad max and [inaudible] fuck you in the

526
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:22,100
drive Thru to Mad Max was,
that's a fucking Joe Pesci Bro.

527
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,010
Yeah, but that was from lethal
weapon. The weapon sucked, Dude. I,

528
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:30,160
that's how I liked the weapon in life.
Horn was okay.

529
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,180
One was kind of cool and then they got
stupid, but mad max is the shit dude.

530
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,950
Mad Max is that, it was
awesome. Bad Ass Braveheart.

531
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:42,530
Braveheart was the shit. Braveheart was
outstanding. That was his best word. Yeah.

532
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,400
I remember leaving that was like a three
hour movie and I left and I went to the

533
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,950
comedy store right afterwards
and I got on stage and I just,

534
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:53,030
I had so much fucking energy just from
that movie. Like I felt it like it,

535
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,480
you know, who used to always say that Paul
Mooney, he used to always say that, uh,

536
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,890
whenever he entertains or
whenever he gets entertained,

537
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:03,530
rather he does a better job
of entertaining. He goes,

538
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:06,770
I always do a better job after I've seen
something entertaining. Yeah. Braveheart.

539
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:08,450
I did not expect that.
I thought that was,

540
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:10,760
I didn't even want to
say it was three hours.

541
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:14,240
I like the movie I wanted to see wasn't,
it was sold out and I was like,

542
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,110
fuck this Braveheart bullshit.

543
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,910
I walked out of that motherfucker
and my head just exploded.

544
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,140
I thought it was a date movie.
You know, it's like, what
does it mean? What is this?

545
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,840
You know, a bunch of dummies
running on each other with swords.

546
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,770
I always thought that that is like the
most tired premise ever threw his group

547
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:32,360
of fucking enemy on one side.
You know,

548
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:34,910
group of soldiers on one side and their
enemy on the other side and they were

549
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:37,580
run out of each other and fucking smash
in the middle and kill each other.

550
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,300
How many times did they do that
fucking scene and you know, keep going.

551
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,090
Brave heart. Brave heart should be
that should have settled it. That shit.

552
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:50,420
Unless you're using monsters and goblins
and shit coming at each other like that.

553
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,900
Stop doing that. Stop doing those.
Gladiator was good though too.

554
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,740
People started making more titanics
you know people rip off movies.

555
00:33:57,741 --> 00:33:58,850
There's like a vampire genre.

556
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,960
What if there's a giant cruise
liners sinking genre? Yeah,

557
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:06,980
they do rip off shore earners but some
they can decide and adventures like the,

558
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,810
that's like the only other, well I think
shit really ripping off. Right, right,

559
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,960
right. But how does that work? There's
only one person authorized. I mean,

560
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:17,740
anyone can pretty much write their
own story about the titanic, right?

561
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,690
I guess once it's covered
like that and people go, well,

562
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,940
it's a academy award winner.
Let's just leave it alone.

563
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,950
I don't think that they left it alone.

564
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:26,960
I think there's a lot of
titanic movies called Titanic.

565
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,640
You know there's a couple of shitty
ones you see now like to cheap ones that

566
00:34:31,641 --> 00:34:36,620
existed before. I don't know who
gives a fuck. Who Cares? Yeah,

567
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:39,650
but anyway, that y'all walking peanuts,
dude. That guy can act as ass off.

568
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,580
There's a few guys like that.
What's his face to the Australian dude?

569
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,430
What the fuck's his name?
Russell Crowe. Correct?

570
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,780
He's a bad motherfucker to Robin Hudson.
Big Balls.

571
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:55,360
Thought he didn't see that new
one. Yes. I didn't even know.

572
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:59,000
It looks so fucking guard.
First of all,

573
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:01,790
he does not look like a Robin Hood.
He's got this fat face.

574
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,030
He looks like a guy who eats too much.
You know what I'm saying? I mean,

575
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:09,050
he looks like this, like he looks
like a well fed taken care of guy.

576
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,410
He doesn't look like a hungry. It was
in Andrews. Who is Robin Russell Crowe.

577
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,310
Russell Crowe. Like he looked, I
mean he's not fat, but he's not,

578
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,850
he's not like a lean like
sinewy we looking dude,

579
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,280
you know that's what you would
picture of Robin Hood Man.

580
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:26,980
You don't picture of some guy looks
like well fed and tights and shit.

581
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:31,060
It's like Robin Hood is that we're trying
to keep out to try to do, if you got,

582
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,450
if Sony pictures gave you like full full
like greenlight power to produce and

583
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:38,280
direct Jack and you know what I mean?

584
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,580
You go fuck, they gotta go up a hill.
Why do they go up this fucking hill?

585
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,620
You know what I mean? They get
some water. Can you imagine that?

586
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:46,260
It's like Robin Hood, you, you're,
you're like handcuffed. You got it.

587
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,410
You got this dude in fucking steels.
Like how are we going to make this happen?

588
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:50,520
I don't see Jack and Jill.

589
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,720
I can see jack and Jill coming out
like the journey up the hill, you know,

590
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,760
or something like that.
I can see a good Robin hood,

591
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,110
but she would have to get someone who's,
you know,

592
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,180
it's all about who writes the
script and who directs it and who,

593
00:36:04,181 --> 00:36:08,950
whose vision it is. Dude did exist
for real, but I mean the story.

594
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:16,160
Robin Robin Hood. What is the actual
story? It was robbing from the rich,

595
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,890
stealing, robbing the rich and giving to
the poor. That's the whole Robin Hood.

596
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:21,630
Damn, there's no Robin
went. It's around a day.

597
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:25,800
Which is the last motherfucker like
what was the, um, what was the story?

598
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:30,960
It was jeans or something like
that because it was so bad.

599
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:34,080
I don't remember shit. The
movie was that bad. It was bad.

600
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:39,240
I liked when he was a fox. He was
a fox. Disney. Who? Russell Crowe.

601
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,750
Robin Hood.
What the fuck are you talking about?

602
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:44,220
I haven't had the old Disney
cartoon where he's a Fox. What?

603
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,290
The original Robin Hood.
I have no idea what you're talking.

604
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:50,640
I've never seen Robin had
cartoon movie. No, he was a fox.

605
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:56,270
Fox Fox who's got some rumors
about loads and Taco bell.

606
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,960
Swear to God. Mushrooms too. Fucking
Fox. Some people can't handle folks.

607
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,400
You know what happened?
We did smoke a lot.

608
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:08,520
Both we both smoked two
hits each and then I said,

609
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,370
do you want some more and Brunch
it? No, no, no. Mother fucker.

610
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:15,860
What are you talking about? I
said, God Damn Fox. Listen Brian,

611
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:20,940
just because remember this? No,
I don't. No, I don't. I don't.

612
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,640
That's, that's like a classic Disney
movie like Bambi and stuff. No,

613
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,180
not everyone saw that.
So he was a fox first came Robinhood.

614
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,500
I don't remember
Ryan.

615
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,890
I when I was talking to some or something.

616
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,620
Well, okay. Anyway, the point was the
Russell Crowe's movie wasn't very good.

617
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:49,470
Back to fucking Mel Gibson. Holy
Shit. When he said, when he,

618
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,720
he tried to break up
his friendship with the,

619
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:55,800
her friendship with their best friend
that she sucked me in five seconds.

620
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:59,160
She's not your friend.
That was deep shit right there.

621
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,980
The Rose Garden. It's hilarious. It
was probably true. Well, what, what,

622
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:09,810
what is it about when someone just has a
colossal catastrophic fuck up like this

623
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,370
that makes you so uncomfortable?

624
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,420
I think it's because you are terrified
that you would ever see that kind of

625
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:16,530
behavior in yourself.

626
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,270
And you can only imagine that it could
be possible in some fucking unsprung fit

627
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:24,540
of madness that you got completely
out of control, you know,

628
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:29,070
and you were drunk or on
drugs or something and you
said Shit equally as crazy.

629
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,230
God Damn check,
cozy,

630
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,070
cozy love to have recordings
of like arguments I got in with

631
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,590
crazy girlfriends when I was young
and stupid. But you know what?

632
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,510
The one thing about this,

633
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,650
the one thing I thought about it at
least three or four times while I'm

634
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:45,130
listening to this is damn,
that bitch could be really psycho.

635
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,550
He's probably fucked up cause she
probably did some crazy shit. Maybe.

636
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:51,460
Maybe I'm just thinking maybe he,
she did some crazy shit.

637
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,570
Then she records it and he's not repeating
what he did because he assumes that

638
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:59,030
she already knows. I mean, of
course, you know it's, I mean he's,

639
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,310
you know what I'm saying?
It's crazy.

640
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:04,650
And if he's not crazy then he's
incredibly weak. That was like the week,

641
00:39:04,651 --> 00:39:07,120
his version of the pimp
hand I've ever heard ever.

642
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,200
They don't you fucking hang up on
me. What are you talking about, son?

643
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,970
Why you get all his brother? He like gave
away every fucking move. First of all,

644
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,830
she's calm and collected.

645
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:22,210
He's screaming and yelling and
calling her a cunt. He loses.

646
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,650
He loses bite off the bat cause she's
like, I don't know why you're so excited.

647
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,540
You need medication blocked, blocked. He
fucking loses. He's trying to tear later.

648
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:33,790
It's he's doing gang or doing nothing.

649
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:37,330
He's telling her he's going to bring the
cops to her house to kick her out with

650
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:40,310
her baby and she's like, you can
do that if you want. She's like,

651
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:44,500
did she owned him? It was just like
straight domination. How dare you?

652
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:49,310
I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to
help out a brother. He's my brother.

653
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,290
He's weak, deprived idiot.
That's a weak, weak man.

654
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,570
We thought we were talking about
Braveheart. You know what I mean?

655
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,540
I've touched me and I'm thinking,
damn this motherfucker out.

656
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,860
You know what I mean? Guys can get
crazy. Great guys can get possessive.

657
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,110
I don't know. You know, he's
a brilliant director to that.

658
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:09,070
Apocalypto was fascinating. I loved it.
I never saw it. I hated the other one.

659
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:12,940
The Passion of the Christ to me was
like a two hour movie about a dude with

660
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:14,920
magic who got the fuck beat out of him.

661
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,160
I mean he could do magic tricks and
they just beat his fucking ass and then

662
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:21,130
killed them and the end and he comes
back. Oh, what a fucking movie.

663
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,950
Like if you take away the story of Jesus,

664
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:27,970
he take away the biblical story of it.
If you don't know that as a reference,

665
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,180
as a standalone movie, it's
terrible. As a standalone movie.

666
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,510
It's a guy who just does a few magic
tricks and they beat the fuck out of him

667
00:40:34,511 --> 00:40:35,800
and kill him.
That's the whole moving to,

668
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:38,410
they've got two and part
three and when it comes,

669
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:41,560
cause a motherfucker comes back,
right. You believe that other shit,

670
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,700
you might as well go with it. There's
more to the story. That's as part why Mel,

671
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,070
that could save your fucking career.
It's hard to,

672
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:53,130
it's so funny how strong the urge is
to look into the past for a time where

673
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:58,090
things were explained and clear and you
know that we were in the presence of

674
00:40:58,091 --> 00:41:02,560
divine glory and the Lord was here
on earth and walking amongst men.

675
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,820
It's so funny how we just have this
incredible need to look to the past.

676
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,460
Like as if there's something
that we knew and we forgot.

677
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,040
There was a connection that
we had and it was lost.

678
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,410
I wonder what that represents.
You know,

679
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:17,530
there's people that think that that
represents psychedelics, that this,

680
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,310
this whole idea of the Christ,

681
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:22,480
this whole idea of that at one point in
time were connected to God and now we're

682
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,440
not.
You know,

683
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:27,550
and a lot of people believe that it was
a climate change issue that mushroom

684
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:31,180
stop growing and they couldn't get them
and they couldn't use them as a regular

685
00:41:31,181 --> 00:41:32,680
part of, of a, of their culture.

686
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,680
You is the whole basis of the sacred
mushroom and the cross that, that book.

687
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,100
So I wonder, man, I wonder
what the fuck that is. But God,

688
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,080
people are so hung up on that idea.

689
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,920
They love the idea of there being a person
at one point in time that really had

690
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:49,990
all the answers. It's so important
to them, you know, if the exist,

691
00:41:49,991 --> 00:41:54,380
it is probably just, uh, you know, a
super enlightened guy who, you know,

692
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:55,071
figure shit out.

693
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:58,460
And people were so stupid back then
that they thought he was magical,

694
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:02,430
but really he probably never even said
he was in a fee exist. I mean, it's just,

695
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,293
it's,
you know,

696
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:06,680
I've heard the arguments against it and
they're much stronger than the arguments

697
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:11,030
for him existence. I know, I, I
view Brian, I go back and forth,

698
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:15,740
but if you just think about it, you
know, the Christians and the Muslims,

699
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,180
they fucking killed each other. They
hate each other. They, you know, the,

700
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,040
the Jews and the Christians
hate each other that killed,

701
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:26,210
he said slaughter each other.
So if there was, if the,

702
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,900
if Jesus didn't exist that Jews would
be talking about that all the time.

703
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:34,310
They say, well, he did exist, but he's
not like the son of God. But yeah,

704
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:37,760
he was a bad mother fucker and that's
not enough. And the same thing with the,

705
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,430
they would be all over it man.
It's just not enough evidence.

706
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,710
And when you were talking about
stories that are, first of all,

707
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:45,980
almost all of the biblical stories came
from somewhere else. Almost all of them.

708
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:51,110
You, you can get the, the story of
uh, the creation from the, the, the,

709
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:53,480
the epic of Gilgamesh has
like so many parallels,

710
00:42:53,481 --> 00:42:56,810
almost the same exact stories are
told through many different cultures.

711
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,050
You get down to that Jesus
character that's in the
movies is category exists and

712
00:43:01,051 --> 00:43:01,810
a lot of,

713
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:06,810
but that Jesus character is exist in
timeline so far earlier than Jesus Christ

714
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:11,060
was supposed to walk the earth as a
person. That's why I'm very skeptical.

715
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:13,160
I don't know. I know that,
who the fuck my theme,

716
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:16,790
that theme has been going on for
thousands of years. If I had to choose,

717
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:20,800
I would say he did exist based
on the Muslims and the Jews.

718
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:23,930
So watch fish but use it all the same.
They were just discussing it.

719
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,793
No one really knows.

720
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:30,130
If we just only discuss shit that we
had proof for then. No, no, no, I'm not,

721
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:32,030
I'm not saying,
I'm not saying don't discuss it.

722
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:35,950
What I'm saying is we have
this inclination to go
one way or the other and I

723
00:43:35,951 --> 00:43:38,330
don't, I don't think it's necessarily
in something like this if I,

724
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,690
if you had to though, but if
you don't, you don't have to.

725
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,300
You know what I'm saying? You're just
a human being. Like the, we have this,

726
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,170
this massive inclination to go
one way or the other, you know,

727
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:51,350
do you go Jesus or atheist?
You go Mac or PC. You know,

728
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,830
it's an urge that we have to like to
accept whether or not someone existed.

729
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:00,140
He existed. He was just a
bad dad was a god particle.

730
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:03,590
I says, Dad was a god
particle. If you don't know,

731
00:44:03,591 --> 00:44:07,550
there's a discussion and debate whether
or not the Higgs Boson particle,

732
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,420
the media crew named God particle,

733
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:14,630
the scientist on a called
the God particle. But what
it basically is is a, uh,

734
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,960
Parker that existed at the
very beginning of the universe,

735
00:44:17,961 --> 00:44:20,600
the birth of the universe of
milliseconds after the big bang.

736
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:23,960
They believe that this particle existed
and they now believe there's five

737
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:28,460
different individual versions of the
Higgs Boson particle and a particle

738
00:44:28,461 --> 00:44:32,040
collider in Illinois of all places is the,
the place

739
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,510
that they're saying that they
were about to shut down.

740
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:41,570
Supposedly it's last breath is supposedly
there's rumors that it found this and

741
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:44,270
we're going to find out in this
speech and Paris next week,

742
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:47,700
is it next week or something like that.
Or there's, there's two different,

743
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,770
there's two different camps on this.

744
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,800
Some scientists are saying that there's
no way and there's no evidence and this

745
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:53,910
is just bullshit and rumors.

746
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,730
And then there's other scientists
that are involved in it.

747
00:44:56,731 --> 00:44:59,250
They're saying it's very clear they
have all the markings that they've

748
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:01,270
discovered this actual particle.
Yeah.

749
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,950
They're going to present their findings
July 22nd at the Paris international

750
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:06,600
kind of joke around
about the shit on stage.

751
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:09,240
You know about like what the fuck are we
doing? You know, because I think it's,

752
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:13,020
it is a strange thing that technology
used to be used to enhance our lives,

753
00:45:13,021 --> 00:45:16,200
you know, like to create cops
and you know, electricity,

754
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:17,970
all these different things
that make our life easier.

755
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,480
But when you get to a certain
level of, of, of discovery,

756
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:23,430
like the Higgs Boson
particle, like, you know,

757
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,410
like what they're working on right now,

758
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:29,100
like these particle colliders and all
this craziness. It's like, wow, like what,

759
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,260
what is, what's going to come out
of here that's going to help us?

760
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,510
Is this going to help us at all
or is this just, we're just,

761
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,600
let's see if we can do this. I mean,
and there's nothing wrong with,

762
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:40,530
let's see if we can do this. If you've
got all your other shit covered, you know,

763
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:43,360
but right now, I mean, look at all the
fucking problems in the world. If the,

764
00:45:43,361 --> 00:45:46,140
the number one thing that
scientists are working on is this,

765
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,410
is that the right thing mean it's
a totally debatable issue. I mean,

766
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:53,910
if you were the guy who got to dictate,
you know how we should fix the world,

767
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,480
you know, and you, you got to bring all
the scientists together and say, hey,

768
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:59,130
you know,
what should we concentrate on?

769
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,100
Would you say let's make little
black holes and let's, you know,

770
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:05,340
let's use the Higgs Boston,
you know, let's try to find
the Higgs Boson particle.

771
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,220
What would would you try to do? I
would let them do it. Jump really high.

772
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,280
You got to let them do it for sure.
Honestly,

773
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:14,340
spent equal time trying
to perfect big dick pills.

774
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,570
Put some time into that too.
Do you think if you jumped every day,

775
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:22,800
and I had some way to calculate how high
you jumped every day and he tried it

776
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:25,740
for 10 years, that the,
how big high do you think,

777
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,930
do you think there's like a wall
of how much you can of course,

778
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,010
or do you think you could, can
continue is how high are you? God Damn,

779
00:46:32,011 --> 00:46:33,730
what a ridiculous question.
That's, that's like what?

780
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,810
I would love to be able to do that
experiment. Why don't you just do it?

781
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:40,740
I thought about it, but my people, my ex
girlfriend thought I was fucking crazy,

782
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:44,910
so I stopped. I only lasts like a
week. Fuck that bitch, man. Try it.

783
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,250
You could become the best jumper ever.
Be on the Olympic jumping team.

784
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:51,930
You have to tell about, my idea is that
you would have to get better every week.

785
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:54,150
You probably wouldn't ever stop.
Your muscles would grow.

786
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:57,450
You would go jump higher and higher
and well, let's put it to the test son.

787
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,500
I don't want to do, I don't have
that time. I don't want it to it.

788
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:00,740
Imagine if you could tell him,

789
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:06,870
listen back to what we were talking about
with the Higgs Boson particle. I don't,

790
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,810
I'm not criticizing, don't get me
wrong. I'm not criticizing scientists.

791
00:47:09,811 --> 00:47:11,640
I'm not saying they should be
concentrating on other things.

792
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:15,270
I just think it's weird. This
obsession that we have with technology,

793
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:18,120
with like digging deeper and deeper
intellect, the heart of matter,

794
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,520
and they're supposed to, man, I
know. I think we're supposed to to,

795
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,430
I mean that's what my
whole thing on stage is.

796
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,370
It's a joke is about that we
create the Big Bang, you know,

797
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:29,980
that human beings are what actually
creates the big bang and crack the

798
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,590
universal open and starts
all over again from scratch.

799
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:34,240
Then 14 billion years later,

800
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,670
another human being developed
at that gets developed,

801
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:38,560
makes the big bang and
do it all over again.

802
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,920
Did you hear that the methane
gas bubble was debunked? That uh,

803
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,050
that whole thing that was
going around? Yeah, I did,

804
00:47:44,051 --> 00:47:45,640
but I don't know if there's
enough data on that.

805
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,080
I don't know who's right and who's wrong.

806
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,530
I know that people that are
talking about that area,

807
00:47:49,531 --> 00:47:53,560
we're talking about that they're not
letting any photograph photographers and

808
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:57,010
they're not letting reporters. Then they
have a huge problem with the, uh, um,

809
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,630
pollution in the air. The, uh, the oil is
not just oil on the surface of the water.

810
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,160
It's, there's a vapor in the air and the
parts per million of acceptable toxins.

811
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:09,610
It's through the fucking roof. So they
might have to evacuate certain areas.

812
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,280
It's gets a fucking
ugly, ugly, ugly scene.

813
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:16,180
You're talking about an oil spill
that's bigger than states, you know,

814
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:16,721
I mean that's,

815
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:20,170
I don't even think we can wrap our head
around how big of a disaster this is.

816
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,090
The ocean is gigantic,

817
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,170
but there's a huge part of it
that is just fucked up right now.

818
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,550
And we've never seen anything
on this scale in human
history that we're aware of.

819
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:35,460
Especially not in like, you
know, with Florida is that's it,

820
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:40,470
Florida. So all those, those houses
as beach front houses that problem,

821
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,660
what areas it's hit and what areas
it hasn't. In Houston, Texas,

822
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:46,480
they're getting those tar
bubbles are when everything is.

823
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,320
And parts of Florida started to get him
about two weeks or saying millions of

824
00:48:50,321 --> 00:48:52,750
fish are dead.
They just put a cap on it.

825
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,880
They finally put some
sort of a cap to stop it.

826
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,360
But there's reports that there's oil
coming from more than one spot off the

827
00:48:58,361 --> 00:49:02,770
ocean floor, which means that the
pipe when it blew up, um, that it's,

828
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:05,860
it's possible that there's all sorts
of ruptures further down the line,

829
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:10,720
which means it's just
good on Ustream right now.

830
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:15,280
There's nine cameras on yet. Well, but
what they're talking about is holes.

831
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,153
Miles.

832
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:19,540
We just take like a little submarine thing
that would go and take go or you know,

833
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,560
or the area you would see whales coming
out of the water. When didn't you?

834
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,500
Well there's guys that have photograph
things that they say are plumes that are

835
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:29,560
inside the water. I don't know.
You know there's that was,

836
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,880
there was a guy on CNN that was talking
about the possibilities and he was just

837
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:34,240
a,

838
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,900
he was a scientist that was explaining
what they're trying to do right now with

839
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:39,820
the cap and what does worst case scenario,

840
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,260
and he said that worst case scenario was
there was holes in other parts of the

841
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:46,000
pipe further down the line.
He said,

842
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:49,690
but that right now appears to be
highly unlikely. So he doesn't know.

843
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:52,660
So they said that his worst case scenario,

844
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,890
and if people online are saying that
it, that is the case, who knows?

845
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,740
We don't know. It's almost like a
media blackout. Like you're only,

846
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,290
you're only allowed to get a
certain amount of information.

847
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:07,060
There's people from a citizen's radio
they put on that Jamie Kilstein dude.

848
00:50:07,061 --> 00:50:08,350
And Allison Kilkenny,

849
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,190
they put on a bunch of stuff on Twitter
where all these people that live on the

850
00:50:12,191 --> 00:50:17,191
Gulf are a accusing BP of dumping sand
onto oil that's washed up on the beach

851
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,091
and they proved it.

852
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:22,330
They have videos of it on youtube where
they're showing the sand and they're

853
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:24,850
showing the black shit
that's underneath the sand.

854
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,470
You know like the show him like layers.
They're like,

855
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,500
they came with trucks and they dumped
sand on top of this oil instead of

856
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:33,860
cleaning the oil up there, like making it
a little bit, the oil doesn't exist. Wow.

857
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,480
That's fucking crazy shit.

858
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,160
But you know,
they do that all the time.

859
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:41,060
Putting sand and rearranging sands on
beaches. That's just a part of each too,

860
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:45,410
you know? Oh, maybe it was
just regular maintenance. Not
if they cover all the oil.

861
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:49,820
That doesn't make any sense. They have,
I mean they bring in Santa beaches,

862
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:53,930
they fucking rate beaches every morning
at some point because having a place

863
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,660
that's a lot of sand. I'm just thinking.
I'm saying the other side, you know,

864
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:01,910
there's no proof that they fucking really
take this sand to a whole coastline.

865
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:03,860
When have they ever done that?
What have they ever gone?

866
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:06,950
Miles and miles down to beach daily.
They do it daily.

867
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:10,220
It's called maintaining beaches,
beaches, some beaches, a lot.

868
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,480
Mostly public beaches.

869
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:13,910
They do that all the time where
they just drive up with trucks,

870
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:17,330
redo beaches all the time.
What did they do?

871
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,350
Did they actually bring sand everyday
replaced sand from the back of the s know

872
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,030
at the top front, you know, to keep it
the beach going, we need to Google this.

873
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:29,060
Are they rotating the sand?
I think we need to Google this.

874
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,750
Why don't you Google Google,

875
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,610
Google,
uh,

876
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,140
BP covering oil with sand and see if we
could find that article and see what it

877
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:40,500
says exactly. Because we're
starting to delve into the world of,

878
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:44,790
we don't know what the fuck
we're talking about. But anyway,

879
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,480
the bottom line is this is a giant
fucking disaster. It's a scary one, man.

880
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,110
I'm not saying that scientists should
stop working on the Higgs Boson particle

881
00:51:52,111 --> 00:51:55,290
and stop working on the large Hadron
collider. I mean, I think the whole,

882
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:56,790
I think you should be able to do
whatever the fuck you want to do.

883
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:59,220
I'm not contributing to society.
These guys are,

884
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,880
it could fuck up clean the oil spill.

885
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:08,000
Yeah. No, I mean there's,
there's out there, you know,

886
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:11,220
they're saying that they did it. I
just did a porky pig there. There's,

887
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:14,330
there's some sort of like microbes
that they built. Yeah, there said this.

888
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,164
The allegations.
Yeah.

889
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,980
There's some sort of microbe that they've
developed that he consumes oil and you

890
00:52:19,981 --> 00:52:23,040
can pour it on top of the oil
and it actually eats the oil.

891
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,760
I wonder if they could do it on that
kind of a scale now maybe it would take

892
00:52:26,761 --> 00:52:30,840
over. It would become some giant fucking
blob and eat in New York. You know,

893
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:34,500
once it gets hungry for oil runs out of
oil that it starts eating tires and shit.

894
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:40,410
Need to dump some vinegar in the
ocean and let it push it to our tires.

895
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:44,430
Tires are made out of oil.
Right. Isn't it? Yeah.

896
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:48,350
Tires are made out of petroleum
fuel tires, right? You need it.

897
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:51,240
You need oil for most things. You can
imagine if there's a fucking disease,

898
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:54,600
like a microbe that started eating
people's tires and somehow or another got

899
00:52:54,601 --> 00:52:57,360
over here from the, the, the
Gulf efforts when they pour,

900
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,480
if they poured the stuff into the ocean
and some of it got out and they started

901
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:03,480
like throwing on the streets in New
York and I started eating people's cars,

902
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,980
eat your tires and shit, eat
your sneakers, you can't walk in.

903
00:53:07,981 --> 00:53:12,390
It becomes a goddamn epidemic.
We have to change over to hemp,

904
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,970
hemp,
everything that could really happen.

905
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,053
It could really,

906
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:22,030
what's the problem with drinking bottled
water? Well, there's a lot of people that

907
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:25,800
it's wasteful and a lot of
people that think that, uh,
you know, you use up so much

908
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,810
oil in the construction of a bottle of
water and then the recycling is only so

909
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:34,080
efficient and you're constantly
contributing to this, uh, you know,

910
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:39,090
ecological ecological disaster we have
right now with recyclables and plastics

911
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:42,680
and you know, all the shit that's in the
ocean right now. Carbon cycle business,

912
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,490
the fucking scam now, is that
what they're saying? Well,

913
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,570
Penn and teller thing about
bullshit and credible,

914
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:52,320
I think penitentiary did a whole
episode of bullshit on it. Yeah.

915
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,490
I don't remember the results though.

916
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,460
There's some times where you just
got to say, and obviously recycling,

917
00:53:56,461 --> 00:53:59,070
it's not a scam. You know, Penn
and teller ever done an episode

918
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,660
at Penn and teller ever done an episode
of bullshit where they decided something

919
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:06,690
that isn't bullshit when they were done.
No. They went and did that episode,

920
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,130
do you think? Oh, I don't
know. They should do.

921
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,820
And then you got up, you got
it. You got to mix it up.

922
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:18,930
They turn into an episode of martial
arts man saying that martial arts lessons

923
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,490
for the money you'd save,

924
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,910
you'd be better off just giving it
to the mugger by not taking them.

925
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:26,520
If you have the money you save by
not taking martial arts lessons,

926
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:29,010
you'd be better off just,
I mean they have to find that conclusion,

927
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,110
they have to find them.

928
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:35,590
But that's just the dumbest doesn't
have an open mind. That's not only that,

929
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,720
that's someone who has never worked out.
You don't understand the benefits,

930
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:43,230
the clarity, these tall fucked up. Right.
He's a great guy. I love that dude.

931
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:48,000
Somebody asked me that. I'm on factor. I
had him on fear factor or I had him on,

932
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:51,360
he was on with uh, with teller
and I became buddies with them,

933
00:54:51,361 --> 00:54:52,290
became email buddies,

934
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:55,470
came to the comedy store a few times and
I hung out with him and did his radio

935
00:54:55,471 --> 00:54:58,080
show a couple of times too when
those moon hoax debates. But he's a,

936
00:54:58,081 --> 00:54:58,914
he's a great guy.

937
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:01,320
Somebody asked me the other day who
would win between you two and a fight.

938
00:55:01,321 --> 00:55:04,260
And I immediately see, I said
Eddie, cause I know he could,

939
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:07,800
he's tapped you 12 years old.
Who would win in a fight?

940
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,480
[inaudible] the bullshit MMA may
question. And because you know,

941
00:55:12,481 --> 00:55:14,180
that's another thing, what
they're saying is, you know,

942
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,240
like if you do certain MMAs
it's not gonna protect.

943
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:20,100
You did a straight Jujitsu match who
you'd kicked my ass, taps me all the time.

944
00:55:20,101 --> 00:55:22,800
I'd ever even come close to tapping
into a real fight Jelica class.

945
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:28,680
Then I was like, wait, no, no wait, Joe
could like punch him in my standards.

946
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:33,210
My kick boxing is probably
better than my Jujitsu. You know,

947
00:55:33,211 --> 00:55:36,930
I don't really do it anymore and
just don't forget about that.

948
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:40,460
You always forget about that. You just
spoke. But if we were the same size too,

949
00:55:40,461 --> 00:55:42,750
I'm still,
I'm like 30 pounds heavier than I was

950
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,510
getting swole. Yeah. So anyway,
so that's, that is a thing though.

951
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,490
Like if you're in a bar fight and you're,
you know,

952
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:53,550
Jujitsu is two people per set of
bar fights is who hit who first.

953
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,310
That's the 90% you know,

954
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,590
just in 90% of avoiding bar
fights is don't go to shitty bars.

955
00:55:58,591 --> 00:56:01,710
Don't hang out with Douche bags. Get
away when you see things are going bad,

956
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:04,590
right? When people started acting Douchey,
you see a comment, it's in the air,

957
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:08,220
you smell it. Defensive drivers to people.
Be careful. You see creep, stay away.

958
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:12,450
There's nothing worse than
drunk. Motherfucking due
to been rejected all night.

959
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:15,210
The club,
some guys get wrong,

960
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,850
so aggro man,

961
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,620
chicks just rejected them all night and
then they see you with your girl and

962
00:56:22,621 --> 00:56:23,530
there's like three of them

963
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,980
and they just can't fucking,
they can't help themselves

964
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,150
and they can't help being disrespectful
to Saul. So unnecessary man.

965
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:34,660
It's so fucking hard for people to
get their shit together so hard.

966
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,640
There's so many dickheads out there.
They're doing.

967
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,770
The bottom line is the war
were saying about martial arts.

968
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:41,790
It's not even about learning
how to fight it. That's your,

969
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:45,220
you're rarely going to use that. If it
was just about learning how to fight,

970
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:47,290
like man, how often does
it even come up? You know,

971
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:49,180
you're just preparing for
something that probably,

972
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:51,820
if you're a smart person will
never happen you in your life,

973
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:55,570
but you get a shit load of benefits
from it. It's not, it's like, you know,

974
00:56:55,571 --> 00:56:59,080
when you play chess, you don't just
play chess to learn how to, you know,

975
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:00,130
finish this one game.

976
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:04,060
And when you play chess to learn the
strategy and to become involved in like

977
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,640
long term planning out of,
you know,

978
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:10,150
any sort of a situation you can
apply chest to your life, you know,

979
00:57:10,151 --> 00:57:12,940
and the same thing as Jujitsu,
same thing as any kind of martial art.

980
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:17,710
You get better at anything that's really
difficult and it makes you better at

981
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:22,150
everything else you do as
well. Like jumping, yeah.

982
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,090
Could you do to helps your music
and your music helps you Jujitsu.

983
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,410
Ah, well let's talk about your seminars
before you answer that question.

984
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:33,450
Where are they? Okay. I got a couple of
seminars coming up. I got Omaha, Nebraska,

985
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:37,500
10 planet Omaha in not this Saturday,
but next Saturday.

986
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:41,220
And then I'm going to be at,
um, the very next Saturday,

987
00:57:41,221 --> 00:57:43,660
July 31st I'll be at,
uh,

988
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,070
the future home of 10th Planet
Charlotte for all the information,

989
00:57:47,071 --> 00:57:48,780
just go to 10th planet j J.
Dot Com

990
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:51,340
and that's where they can order all your,
your DVDs and

991
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:54,000
yeah, you've got a 10 pound at
J J. Dot Com. Call on the forum.

992
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:56,840
Then you'd be reform and all
of the information. Just know,

993
00:57:56,990 --> 00:58:01,120
look for the Charlotte or the Omahas
seminar and there'll be a flyer up and

994
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:01,870
you're all good.

995
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:05,370
Now, don't you think that Jujitsu helps
you music and music helps with Jujitsu?

996
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,300
Don't you think that anytime you,
you like,

997
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:10,330
you get great at anything in your life
that enhances all the other things in

998
00:58:10,331 --> 00:58:11,164
your life?

999
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,600
Yes, definitely. Um,

1000
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:18,690
but with Jujitsu you see constantly with
Jujitsu is you see yourself as a total

1001
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:23,920
retard with a certain move. And then
you see yourself practice and get good,

1002
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:24,820
and then you master it.

1003
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:29,530
And you constantly see that with all these
different moves, Jujitsu, so gigantic,

1004
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,090
there's a million different paths.

1005
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,840
You need three lifetimes to
master the whole game of Jujitsu.

1006
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:38,080
I mean I've been doing too just to 16
years. I got a lot of holes in my game,

1007
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:42,100
but I'm good at the stuff that I focused
on and the stuff I focused on and put

1008
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,680
the numbers in. The reps,
you see that constant.

1009
00:58:44,681 --> 00:58:48,310
So you see that our bodies are magical.
Our Bot,

1010
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:52,810
we have two people inside
of us, the conscious person
and the unconscious person,

1011
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,220
and you are,

1012
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:58,930
you want to train the conscious person
so much that that unconscious person,

1013
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:02,620
the other dude, you've done it so
much that he's going to do it all.

1014
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:04,690
Then you become the executive producer.

1015
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:06,880
You know like when someone
shredding on piano,

1016
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,790
they're not calling out the
commands like this key, that key,

1017
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:11,200
that key they did out in the beginning,

1018
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,480
but after awhile it's like
you're executive producing,

1019
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:15,250
you have a song in your head,
you look down,

1020
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,020
you're looking at a certain area and Bam,

1021
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:19,120
that person inside of
you does it like magic.

1022
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:23,240
So once you see it in Jujitsu over
and you'll realize that our bodies are

1023
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:26,630
magical. Then a work, not just
for Jujitsu but for anything.

1024
00:59:26,631 --> 00:59:29,990
If you decided to play tennis, guess
what? The longer you play tennis,

1025
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,050
the longer you put the hours in it,
the better you get at most.

1026
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:33,801
People don't see that.

1027
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:37,730
Most people don't have any confidence
in themselves whatsoever with anything

1028
00:59:37,731 --> 00:59:39,950
they think they can't do that.
They think that'll never happen.

1029
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:44,480
You can actually do anything. You
really can. You'll get good at anything.

1030
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:48,560
If you focus on it, you're, you
put the numbers, you put the reps.

1031
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:49,520
That's what it's all about.

1032
00:59:49,521 --> 00:59:52,820
The only thing that's different between
me and a white belt in Jujitsu is the

1033
00:59:52,821 --> 00:59:53,990
number of,

1034
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:57,860
of of reps that I've put in with
my certain style and you know,

1035
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:03,170
and in Jujitsu you realize that and it
brings your whole other life up because

1036
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,190
in other aspects of your life, your day
job or your longterm goal, your dream,

1037
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,420
you'll realize, damn, all I gotta do is
put the numbers in whatever direction

1038
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,560
it is.
It definitely,

1039
01:00:13,561 --> 01:00:17,820
Jujitsu definitely shows
you in any martial art and
any difficult endeavor shows

1040
01:00:17,821 --> 01:00:22,290
you what your potential is and how you
can expand your potential as a human

1041
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:25,800
being. But what it doesn't
give you is creativity.

1042
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:30,450
Creativity is a totally different
thing that's attached to,

1043
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:34,230
to ambition and to, you
know, focus and intensity.

1044
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:37,710
There's something about creativity
that comes from a very pure place, but,

1045
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:40,470
and you could be a hard
worker all you want, but you,

1046
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:45,030
you might not necessarily necessarily
been able to be able to tap into the well

1047
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:48,090
of creativity. You know what I'm talking
about? Sure. You gotta be born with,

1048
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:51,260
you're pretty creative with your moves
in Jiu Jitsu. So that isn't there. Like,

1049
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:55,400
wouldn't there be that creativity is
an art. Jujitsu is an art. I mean,

1050
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:59,880
martial arts are arts, you know, more
ties and art. There's an art to, like,

1051
01:00:59,881 --> 01:01:02,900
whenever I say, like I'm doing
commentary and I'll say, look,

1052
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:06,630
look at this beautiful combination. It is
beautiful to me. I'm not just saying it,

1053
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:10,560
that's, that's the, that's
an art form. That's, it just
led to me, that's a painting.

1054
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:14,990
That's a, you know, an incredible dance.
That's a, you know, that's a, a work, uh,

1055
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:15,833
a masterpiece.

1056
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:19,740
Like my favorite is when Anderson Silva
finished off rich Franklin in the second

1057
01:01:19,741 --> 01:01:20,280
fight.

1058
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,960
There's a fucking combination where
like nine out of 10 shots land and he's

1059
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:29,700
landing punches and knees to the body
and he's mixing them up and it's fucking

1060
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:33,540
poetry. It's ballet, you know,
that's an artist doing that. Man.

1061
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,530
Jiu Jitsu is even more creative than
that because there's so many more moves

1062
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,340
with kickboxing, you know, in Indian
wrestling and whatever, there's, you know,

1063
01:01:41,341 --> 01:01:44,160
there's take downs and there's controls
and there's a lot of different reversals

1064
01:01:44,161 --> 01:01:48,600
and stuff like that. But with Jujitsu
that just the path to the submissions,

1065
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:52,830
the tree has so many branches and there's
so many different ways to approach

1066
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,560
each aspect of the game. From
the bottom, from the top,

1067
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:59,340
it does so many different sweeps and
reversals and so many different half guard

1068
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:02,910
techniques and full guard techniques. It's
impossible to come to an end, you know,

1069
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,750
it's, it's out of control and,
and my Jujitsu and my music, it's,

1070
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,330
there are so parallel in so many ways.
It's like in Jujitsu,

1071
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,650
I am not an athlete. I'm not
explosive. I am not powerful.

1072
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:20,370
I can't run fast. I can't jump
high. I am not an athlete.

1073
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,670
Never was. Even when I wrestled in
high school for a couple of years,

1074
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,580
I got away on tricks.
That's,

1075
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:31,410
I had to think my way past the athletes
and just to be able to hang with like

1076
01:02:31,411 --> 01:02:35,100
the real serious athlete. I'm not an
athlete. Same thing with my music.

1077
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:39,780
I am not a virtuoso at any instrument.
I don't shred on anything.

1078
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:44,070
I just put it all together,
you know? And, and it's, it's,

1079
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:48,180
it's a strange parallel that Ah,
you know, but it's creativity. Yeah.

1080
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:48,971
Because your did,

1081
01:02:48,971 --> 01:02:52,380
you did choose a very creative Jujitsu
to the most creative in my opinion.

1082
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:52,921
And you know,

1083
01:02:52,921 --> 01:02:55,050
we're friends and I'm not supposed
to say that cause it sounds like,

1084
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:59,310
oh that's bullshit. But it is, if I was
just a, a Jujitsu analyst, I would say,

1085
01:02:59,311 --> 01:03:02,340
well here's a guy who's, I mean there's a
lot of creative guys, be no sham breeze,

1086
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:04,140
creative, you know, so many
different cards were created.

1087
01:03:04,141 --> 01:03:08,010
But as far as like putting it together
in a system of all these weird different

1088
01:03:08,011 --> 01:03:11,460
positions, in 90% of them
you have invented and the
ones you haven't, you know,

1089
01:03:11,461 --> 01:03:14,490
your credit, all the different individuals
that contributed to whatever move.

1090
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:16,920
That's a, that's an unusual thing, man.

1091
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:21,921
That's an incredibly prolific career
of just creating Jujitsu and putting it

1092
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:24,630
down. I mean, very few human
beings have ever done that. Yeah.

1093
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,230
Thank you.
Look at your system,

1094
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:28,690
Mueller gear system. I mean, and,

1095
01:03:28,691 --> 01:03:31,960
and all the different techniques
that you've added to, you know,

1096
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,380
to the whole Nogi game.

1097
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:36,570
It's a lot of God damn technique.
You know what my,

1098
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:41,690
I think my strongest point is that
I don't like being raised with just,

1099
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:44,130
you know,
the terrible household.

1100
01:03:44,131 --> 01:03:47,640
I mean with my Stepdad and my real dad
and no one cares and then constantly

1101
01:03:47,641 --> 01:03:51,510
watching TV with sitcoms where
everything is just perfect.

1102
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:55,080
I just never believed anything.
I thought everyone was bullshitting me.

1103
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,150
So the same thing when I
came into martial arts.

1104
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,540
I'm not loyal to any martial art.
I don't care. And growing up,

1105
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:03,510
listening to Bruce Lee and listening to
what he had to say about opening your

1106
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:05,280
mind and don't follow one style.

1107
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,820
I was really influenced by Bruce Lee
and he was right to me because my family

1108
01:04:08,821 --> 01:04:12,720
was just not, it was not growing pains.
My family was not the Brady bunch.

1109
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:16,860
It was terrible. So I just questioned
everything. So as soon as karate,

1110
01:04:16,861 --> 01:04:19,560
it's karate seemed good. I started with
karate. Susan's that didn't pan out.

1111
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:22,830
I saw Jujitsu, I was gone. I
didn't give a shit about karate.

1112
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:27,750
I went to do Jitsu and as soon as
I saw the Jujitsu started becoming,

1113
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,150
um,
what they were claiming,

1114
01:04:30,151 --> 01:04:34,860
the traditional martial arts were
becoming just the Brazilian jujitsu became

1115
01:04:34,861 --> 01:04:38,880
close minded. And I was
like, I'm not going to key in
some circles. Yes, yes, yes.

1116
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:43,320
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So some guys
are love really open mind. Generally.

1117
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:48,120
Generally 99% of the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
community thinks 10th planet Jiu Jitsu,

1118
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:50,850
this mythical generally. But
there are some people, you know,

1119
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:52,980
not everybody does that frustrate

1120
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,710
the shit out of you or what, what does
that feel like when you got, you know,

1121
01:04:55,711 --> 01:04:58,260
all these guys, Vinny Magallanes,
all these like high level guys,

1122
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:01,020
George Sada Rapa lists, you know, they,
they go fucking crazy for it and they,

1123
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,790
they totally fully believe in that system.

1124
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,280
But then you've got other guys
that are like saying, Oh, you know,

1125
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:09,250
you didn't invent the, we've been doing
the, what do you think about that?

1126
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:11,980
I love it man.
I love the stronger the resistance,

1127
01:05:11,981 --> 01:05:16,510
the longer it takes for 10
planet to become, uh, get uh, um,

1128
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:22,090
uh, become, uh, any, you know,
not mythical as long, the
longer it takes, the better.

1129
01:05:22,091 --> 01:05:24,400
It's just going to be sweeter at
the end. I love it. I love the,

1130
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:29,430
if there was no resistance to my
philosophies and let's say in 2003 if I,

1131
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,540
when I decided not to teach with the g,

1132
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:35,890
I decided to open up the school Nogi
and let's say Helio Gracie back then and

1133
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:39,670
Carlene hos. If they said, you know
what? This American is making a point.

1134
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:43,420
The reason why Jujitsu isn't doing
that good in MMA anymore is the geek.

1135
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,750
All right? Everybody is ordered
to start teaching without the g.

1136
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,860
If they just all jumped on with me
because I was doing this for Jujitsu.

1137
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:54,180
I wasn't doing it to battle
against the Brazilian Jujitsu.

1138
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:56,500
I was doing it for Jujitsu.
I'm like MMA.

1139
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:00,550
It was doing it because that's
what you believe. I was a big,

1140
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,810
Jujitsu was in my heart. Jujitsu is, I
was doing it for Jujitsu. I was like,

1141
01:06:04,811 --> 01:06:07,690
let's bring Jujitsu back in MMA.
We've got to get rid of the geese.

1142
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:10,990
If everyone would agreed with
me back then that first of all,

1143
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:14,470
the state of no Jujitsu
would be out of this world.

1144
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:18,760
It would be crazy if everybody joined
in and just not me and my association.

1145
01:06:18,761 --> 01:06:23,560
If we all just agreed and you know,
there would be a, you know, 500 guys,

1146
01:06:23,561 --> 01:06:24,360
it's just like

1147
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,740
Burleson as podcasts. I have no
fucking idea what we're talking about.

1148
01:06:26,741 --> 01:06:29,300
So let me just explain, uh, there's a, uh,

1149
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:31,750
a whole different to two
different types of Jujitsu,

1150
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,510
good Jujitsu with a Kimono or a g,
you know,

1151
01:06:34,511 --> 01:06:38,440
it's like that karate uniform on and a
lot of guys do that and those Jujitsu

1152
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:42,010
that you use Gnocchi and there's a
big thing called the Abu Dhabi world

1153
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:45,760
championships and that's where all the
best Gnocchi guys in the world fight.

1154
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:50,830
And the Nogi style is what you're going
to see in MMA because when you see guys

1155
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:51,880
use a gay all the time,

1156
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:55,490
they're grabbing the GE and they get used
to controlling their opponent with the

1157
01:06:55,491 --> 01:06:57,610
biggie. Then when they have
to fight in the octagon,

1158
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,190
they have no Geeta hold onto in.
A lot of them look lost.

1159
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:03,940
And that's responsible for a lot of
the early UFC fights having really good

1160
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:06,310
Jujitsu guys, but they couldn't do
shit when they fell. They're back.

1161
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:09,400
They couldn't do anything in
certain positions to handles. Yeah.

1162
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:14,110
There used to handle not Eddie devise
the whole system entirely based on Nogi.

1163
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:18,670
He abandoned diggy and when he started
teaching he just went total like MMA

1164
01:07:18,671 --> 01:07:19,190
style.

1165
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:21,800
Does he give you all the keys that
he's abandoned because you have a whole

1166
01:07:21,801 --> 01:07:23,810
closet full of ice right there.
Them bitches.

1167
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:27,830
Think if you're wearing to 500
keys and even working anymore,

1168
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:31,420
what was the question? When we're talking
about, we're just talking about Jujitsu,

1169
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:35,210
being frustrated that you don't get the
credit that you deserve. I like it, man.

1170
01:07:35,211 --> 01:07:39,140
I love him. I love what's going on right
now. Is that with me in burst? Why?

1171
01:07:39,141 --> 01:07:42,290
Why even worry about that? Right? Just
concentrate, keep doing the good stuff.

1172
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,560
I love every day, man. I'm, I
realized and it would if I don't,

1173
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:48,350
if I didn't really think about it
like maybe five, six years ago,

1174
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:50,960
it did bother me. It did
bother me that, you know,

1175
01:07:50,961 --> 01:07:54,710
when I decided to open up a
school without a geek for Jujitsu,

1176
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,540
the people that I was doing it for,

1177
01:07:56,541 --> 01:08:00,260
they turn their back on me and they
made me out to be like this trader.

1178
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:03,920
It's interesting. I'm a trader and I'm
like, no, I'm doing this for us man.

1179
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,420
It's interesting.
We were talking about how

1180
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:09,250
growing up in a shitty household that
when you have this fucked up family life

1181
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,850
and then you see bullshit on television,
how it makes you question everything.

1182
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,940
You're forced to question everything.
And I had the exact same experience.

1183
01:08:16,941 --> 01:08:20,750
My life was not nearly as Shitty as yours,
but there was a lot of problems. One,

1184
01:08:20,751 --> 01:08:24,530
my dad was super violent and used to beat
my mom and I saw it when I was a young

1185
01:08:24,531 --> 01:08:28,850
kid. I saw it when I was like five.
And um, I'll never forget that shit.

1186
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:32,060
I'll never forget thinking that my dad
was like my hero. I thought, you know,

1187
01:08:32,061 --> 01:08:36,110
my dad was like this cool guy and I saw
my dad smacked my mother in the face

1188
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:39,200
over nothing and dropped her
right in the kitchen floor.

1189
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:40,940
And I went running into the room to hide.

1190
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:45,740
And I'll never forget thinking at that
moment in time, I can't trust anybody.

1191
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:50,240
They might all be fucking
crazy. Everybody's wrong.
I knew there was no reason.

1192
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,080
My fault,
my,

1193
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,080
this is what my mom went to
go get something for dinner
and she came back home

1194
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:55,910
with hamburger and that's why he hit her.

1195
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:58,520
He was like hamburger and he
fucking smacked in the face.

1196
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:03,350
And so from that moment
on, like literally, I've,
I've questioned everything.

1197
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:06,290
That's what made me become a standup
comedian. You know, people who say, Oh,

1198
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:09,440
were you a class clown? I mean, I said
funny shit every now and then in class.

1199
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:12,320
But what I would really was, was
the clash questioner, you know,

1200
01:09:12,321 --> 01:09:15,200
I was the class guy. The guy would go,
well, why are you even saying that?

1201
01:09:15,201 --> 01:09:18,090
That doesn't make any sense.
What about this? You know, I was,

1202
01:09:18,091 --> 01:09:21,360
the guy would get in trouble for asking
questions. Oh, that was me too, man.

1203
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:25,670
It all depended on the teacher. If the
teacher was weak and she had a big heart,

1204
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,860
I crushed. I was the loudest
always causing disruptions.

1205
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,370
But if Mr Enders,
he didn't give a fuck.

1206
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,850
And so I was quiet as hell. I remember
this girl told me what you think,

1207
01:09:37,851 --> 01:09:41,870
you're so quiet in here, but in Miss
Aspens class you're out of control.

1208
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:42,800
Did I gave her a nerve?

1209
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:46,400
I gave to teachers and nervous breakdown
this Franklin and [inaudible] and in

1210
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:50,300
the 10th grade Miss Aspen,
I feel really well.

1211
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:53,570
I was proud of it back then and um,
I,

1212
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,200
I wouldn't be proud of it now if I like,
you know,

1213
01:09:56,201 --> 01:09:57,500
kind of in a time machine and I went back,

1214
01:09:57,501 --> 01:09:59,690
I would feel really bad
that happened so long ago,

1215
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:03,300
but I think she might
be alright. I got, uh,

1216
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:06,880
I got kicked out of school for drawing
cartoons of teachers. I would grow,

1217
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:10,520
draw cartoons, a teacher's fucking and
like they're really looked like them,

1218
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:14,920
you know. And uh, I drew this one
Spanish teacher. She, uh, I uh,

1219
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:18,860
had her without her makeup. I drew with
she where she'd wear a ton of makeup.

1220
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:22,300
So I do with her makeup and then I
drew one without her makeup and uh,

1221
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:26,210
I got expelled or suspended,
rather kicked out of school.

1222
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,030
I remember like real clearly though,

1223
01:10:29,031 --> 01:10:32,780
like the first laugh I ever got was
like the first time I was like, wow,

1224
01:10:32,781 --> 01:10:35,990
that was kind of cool. Was in a math
class where a teacher was upset at me.

1225
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:40,130
It's just teacher.
She had this really strong urban accent,

1226
01:10:40,131 --> 01:10:44,870
quote unquote and uh, she was his math
teacher and she was like, really? Um,

1227
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,430
just like, just aggressively
conti. I just didn't like her.

1228
01:10:48,431 --> 01:10:52,640
I didn't like her class. And uh, I
was talking apparently and she goes,

1229
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:55,580
miss or Rogan,
since you know everything,

1230
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:58,880
would you like to come up here and do
both of these problems with his class?

1231
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,780
So I go, would you like me
to do both of them problems?

1232
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,390
And the whole place fell the fuck out.

1233
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:09,290
Like dudes just start laughing and
slap and tables and she goes, go ahead,

1234
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:13,470
laugh at Mr Rogan. Mr Rogan is
going nowhere in life. And uh,

1235
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:14,370
she suspended me.

1236
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,410
She sent me to the Dean and they suspended
me for fucking just me. Come on, man.

1237
01:11:19,411 --> 01:11:22,800
You're teaching math. You don't even know
how to talk English. This is nonsense.

1238
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:23,880
As a dumb conversation,

1239
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:25,910
I would shoot spit wads and Ms. Franklin.
Sarah,

1240
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:29,090
she had a big bouffant hairdo
and we would shoot speak bonds.

1241
01:11:29,091 --> 01:11:32,870
We would do some terrible stuff.
I was terrible when I was bored.

1242
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:36,200
When I was bored, I just did not want
to pay attention. I didn't give a fuck.

1243
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:39,950
I wouldn't fuck around and guys classes
though. I wasn't on the fuck. I'm like,

1244
01:11:39,951 --> 01:11:43,490
I'm not Mr. Reed.
My Sixth Grade Algebra teacher,

1245
01:11:43,491 --> 01:11:46,160
Mr fucking read it was me,
Bobby joys.

1246
01:11:46,161 --> 01:11:50,480
And is this the Cambodian chick named
pool? Muah. Right? Poor Melissa. It was,

1247
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:52,840
we laughed. He would get
really mad. So it was hard.

1248
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:57,440
Me and Bobby tried to go above
a choice and go here. Oh,

1249
01:11:57,630 --> 01:12:00,750
Edgar Bravo. Okay. A pool.

1250
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:06,230
He was saying that black boys,
dude, it was hard to contain.

1251
01:12:06,231 --> 01:12:07,550
I'll never forget pool at Moma.

1252
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,280
Just some something about
schools, man, where you really,

1253
01:12:10,281 --> 01:12:12,110
it's not just learning shit,
you're,

1254
01:12:12,111 --> 01:12:14,620
you're going in there and
this intense environment,

1255
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,760
it's like preparing you for work.
You know,

1256
01:12:16,761 --> 01:12:19,850
you're getting prepared for like intense
social environments doing shit you

1257
01:12:19,851 --> 01:12:21,260
don't want to do around a bunch of people.

1258
01:12:21,261 --> 01:12:24,410
You don't want to be around forced
into a room together, you know?

1259
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:28,580
And that's a credible that
we put so little effort into
making sure teachers are

1260
01:12:28,581 --> 01:12:30,320
good.
I mean it's a really amazing,

1261
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,800
they should get paid about the same as
doctors of some sorts and these family

1262
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:37,160
agrees to that everybody.
But if nothing's happening,

1263
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:40,580
no one's doing anything about everybody
agrees on it, you know, it'd be cool.

1264
01:12:40,581 --> 01:12:45,260
Why does it make pot legal and have
like put 10% of pot go to pay teachers?

1265
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:49,430
How about that? Or they should just charge
money for school. That's what I think.

1266
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:51,270
No,
nobody would go to school,

1267
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:55,640
man. People can't. People are barely
getting by. Especially people with kids.

1268
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:58,160
They're barely getting by.
You can't make them pay for school.

1269
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:01,670
But it's just incredible that we have
all this money for fucking relief to

1270
01:13:01,671 --> 01:13:06,170
Israel and all this money for, you
know, the Afghan war and the Iraqi war.

1271
01:13:06,171 --> 01:13:08,690
We got all this money, but we don't
have enough money for fucking teachers.

1272
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:12,410
That's incredible that we
care so much about our future,

1273
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,380
that we want to deal with the problems
that we have right now and spend every

1274
01:13:15,381 --> 01:13:17,330
fucking doll.
We have thrown money at it,

1275
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:21,200
but we don't want to look
at the foundation of what
causes fucking problems in

1276
01:13:21,201 --> 01:13:24,980
our own country. What causes
so much crime, which causes
so much civil disarray.

1277
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:27,600
Skulls, show retards. Somebody
dummies school should have

1278
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:29,300
some kind of profit though.
You know,

1279
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:33,020
they should do some kind
of like advertising. You're
not like have banner ads.

1280
01:13:33,021 --> 01:13:35,660
There's, you know, they need
to update the school system.

1281
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:39,070
Probably like overhaul and change.
Make it fun.

1282
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,920
Isn't it weird that it's actually weird
because you're paying taxes for it, man.

1283
01:13:42,921 --> 01:13:47,170
What if, what if there was like reality
shows based on third graders? You know, we

1284
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:51,130
need, it needs to be fun for
kids. That's where kids learn.

1285
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:54,190
Kids learn when it's fun.
Everything is not supposed to be boring.

1286
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,100
Everything is not supposed to suck.
That's not natural.

1287
01:13:57,130 --> 01:14:00,850
And the reason why kids hate it is
because it feels like shit. It's not fun.

1288
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:04,690
There's gotta be a way to
make becoming enlightened,

1289
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:07,980
becoming educated and you know,
becoming, you know, having your,

1290
01:14:07,981 --> 01:14:11,740
your life enriched with new information
that should be fun for kids. Positive,

1291
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:12,221
you know,

1292
01:14:12,221 --> 01:14:15,700
the fact that we set them up with fucking
shitty teachers and shitty schools and

1293
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,910
under motivated people that can't
control people like Eddie in their class.

1294
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,540
Old Ladies, I'll kill an old lady dude's

1295
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,280
I had this one dude,

1296
01:14:26,281 --> 01:14:29,550
Mr. White and Mr. White was a Vietnam vet
and always wanted to tell us about it.

1297
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,910
I always want to tell us about
Vietnam and he, you would always snap.

1298
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,370
Like if you asked for a pencil
one time we asked for a pencil,

1299
01:14:35,371 --> 01:14:36,390
some doodads for pencil.

1300
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:40,440
Mr. White pulls out his desk drawer
to browse it across the floor,

1301
01:14:40,441 --> 01:14:43,140
filled with pencils and shit.
Hurls this shit. He goes,

1302
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:47,470
go get a pencil, go pick up
a pencil. And the kid got up,

1303
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,800
grabbed pencil,
went back at,

1304
01:14:49,801 --> 01:14:52,540
sit down and nobody said a fucking word
for the rest of the class were like this

1305
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:55,980
to just through a drawer
filled with pencils. Like,

1306
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,750
are you allowed to do that today? That
brought guy would probably be in jail,

1307
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:01,930
but I used to have a teacher like I
would always sleep in class and he would

1308
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:03,940
come and full on soccer,

1309
01:15:03,941 --> 01:15:07,810
kicked the bottom of the
table so you bet Bam,

1310
01:15:07,811 --> 01:15:11,530
you know fucking it would wake you up
and scare the fuck out of you at the same

1311
01:15:11,531 --> 01:15:13,910
time. It was the worst and
it fucking hurt. It was a,

1312
01:15:13,911 --> 01:15:17,710
it was like that much desk in between
him kicking me in the fucking head.

1313
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,920
Help Mood
Mr. Allen,

1314
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:25,330
Jason Alan's dad wrestler. But
when a, when a spit Wad lady,

1315
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,410
she had a nervous breakdown and we
brought in a substitute teacher,

1316
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:32,440
big buff dude. He was going to
come in and he heard about me.

1317
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:35,530
I wasn't going to fuck with them
but I still make the class laugh.

1318
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,800
He would actually make me stand in a
corner if I do, I wouldn't do anything.

1319
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:42,430
I was just standing there and people
were laughing cause like my face. Yeah,

1320
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:44,950
I would just wait him and he made you
stand in a corner but you didn't do

1321
01:15:44,951 --> 01:15:48,880
anything to be made to stand in the
corner. Little things with my face,

1322
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:52,750
like I wasn't, how'd you get stuck
in the corner? I don't remember.

1323
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:57,160
But I do remember being in the corner and
just like really being end to the wall.

1324
01:15:57,430 --> 01:16:00,700
Like I was staring at the wall and people
were still laughing and that guy said

1325
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:01,840
fuck this class.

1326
01:16:01,841 --> 01:16:04,630
Cause he couldn't really do anything
to me because I wasn't saying anything.

1327
01:16:04,631 --> 01:16:08,080
I would just stand in and everybody was
watching me. So no matter what I did,

1328
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,760
he just went insane too.
Wow. What a nightmare. Yeah,

1329
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:15,460
it was crazy, man. You got a lot
of pleasure out of that. Right?

1330
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,590
We would turn off the light. She would
have, the crazy thing is we weren't,

1331
01:16:21,591 --> 01:16:24,010
I mean never became a comedian.
I will.

1332
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:26,410
I did do it a little bit
and I tried it nine times.

1333
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:30,340
How come you didn't keep going?
Because I realized that just like Jujitsu,

1334
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:33,280
just like surfing,
just like mountain biking,

1335
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:35,110
if you want to get really good at it,

1336
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:39,310
you got to spend a lot of time crafting
it and putting together, you know, uh,

1337
01:16:39,311 --> 01:16:43,930
10 minutes, sad of 15 minutes and
then I realize, wow, you can't,

1338
01:16:43,931 --> 01:16:46,390
this isn't something that you can
just get up on stage and you're a bad

1339
01:16:46,391 --> 01:16:49,810
motherfucker.
You have to carefully crafted practice it,

1340
01:16:49,811 --> 01:16:53,560
go up to all these open mics. You got
to, you know, it's a, it's an art.

1341
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:56,220
And I realized, man, I don't
have time for another arc.

1342
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:59,010
Like I would like to learn how to surf.
I don't have time for,

1343
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:01,180
I would like to learn how to motocross,

1344
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:03,730
like with the motorcycles and jumping
Dirk things and all that shit.

1345
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:07,520
I would love that, but I
don't have, there's, there's
not enough time in the day.

1346
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:11,000
So I decided,
you know what the best move is to

1347
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,770
just fucking focused on Jiu Jitsu
and music and that's it, man.

1348
01:17:15,771 --> 01:17:18,620
I gotta I gotta I can't be spreading
myself. Then Todd White told me that.

1349
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:20,900
He goes, dude, you're
spreading yourself. Then dude,

1350
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:25,970
that's not good focus and I'm like,
you know what I got and plus it's sucked.

1351
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:28,790
Big gigantic donkey balls,

1352
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:33,560
buffalo balls to bomb on stage and
like at least half the time I bombed.

1353
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:37,160
I just like too nervous man.
I was just super nervous.

1354
01:17:37,161 --> 01:17:41,990
I went up there and it was just death.
I'll never forget the worst time I bombed.

1355
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:44,510
I came off and Joe,

1356
01:17:44,511 --> 01:17:48,380
because I was Joe's project and my Joe
had shit riding on me because he was

1357
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:52,490
happy meat cut in line at Sunday night
open mic night when there's like 50

1358
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:56,030
people waiting in line all day. Joe would
just say put them on right before me.

1359
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:58,790
Like I would cut in and the comedians
that go with this fucking bullshit,

1360
01:17:58,791 --> 01:18:02,780
but Joe was running the comedy store so
they would just put me in no experience

1361
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:07,070
ever. I go on stage and a couple of
times I did our light and Joe, can I go?

1362
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:08,870
Oh I do. That was pretty good too.
That was pretty good. We got to we,

1363
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,840
I like what you said about that. Like we
said about that. Now let's do this now.

1364
01:18:11,841 --> 01:18:16,040
Cut that out, edit this out. The worst
bombing I came out, Joe said, all right,

1365
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:16,730
can I follow me?

1366
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:19,760
So he takes her to the fucking back
and like I could see him thinking like,

1367
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:20,594
how are we going to do this?

1368
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,870
Cause it was like he had a safe space
to like it was for him, you know?

1369
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:27,190
And it was really bad. It was like
the stripper, like it was like,

1370
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,130
I didn't even tell jokes, I just
went on stage. I was just obsessed.

1371
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:35,060
Like I had [inaudible] had some good,
some bits. You had some bids. The one,

1372
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:35,930
the two that I,

1373
01:18:35,931 --> 01:18:39,170
that that did the best was when I
talked about when I had sex with a one,

1374
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:42,890
one grown, a rag in the total darkness.
And then when I turned on the light,

1375
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,620
it was just, just blood
everywhere. That was all right.

1376
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:47,780
People were kind of
into that a little bit.

1377
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:51,440
And then the other one was about my dad,
the very first time I went up.

1378
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:53,600
That's the, gave me the
confidence. First Time I went up,

1379
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:55,700
I talked about my dad and went
to Dicky was or something.

1380
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:59,030
And I got a couple of laughs
and I was like, Damn. Oh my God,

1381
01:18:59,031 --> 01:19:01,570
I think I could do this. Oh Shit,
I think I could do this. Fuck that.

1382
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:06,530
Comedy Store Open Mike Night,
there's an air of sad and pathetic.

1383
01:19:06,531 --> 01:19:07,011
There's like a,

1384
01:19:07,011 --> 01:19:11,960
a vibe in the air that's very difficult
to cut through and especially during

1385
01:19:11,961 --> 01:19:14,630
those open Mike night
sets, those are, it's like,

1386
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:18,080
like you don't even really know what
comedy is when you're doing those cause

1387
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:18,201
you're,

1388
01:19:18,201 --> 01:19:22,070
you're doing them for these weird crowds
that have only seen people eat shit for

1389
01:19:22,071 --> 01:19:25,370
fucking the last hour and a
half. Anybody any good, you know,

1390
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:28,700
I mean that's how it is in the beginning.
Open Mike Nights, they're terrible.

1391
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,290
I was terrible in the beginning.

1392
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:32,570
Everyone is terrible in the beginning
and you're, you're going, you know,

1393
01:19:32,571 --> 01:19:36,290
there's five, six, seven terrible
people in a row there. W It's weird.

1394
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,910
It was kind of,
shows are so weird.

1395
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:39,640
I had to make a choice,
man.

1396
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,400
That was the last time I was on stage
as the comedy store Sunday night.

1397
01:19:42,401 --> 01:19:46,480
And I don't know, after I got off I was
like, you know what, I'm just, I don't,

1398
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:49,600
like you said, I need to put way
more energy and this and I'm not,

1399
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:53,040
I'm not spending three hours
that night at the comedy store.

1400
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:54,890
I

1401
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:58,640
think it's one of those things that
it has to be a big focus of your life.

1402
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,520
You can't, I mean, even when
I've put it on the side,

1403
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:03,920
even while I've been doing it for so long,
you know,

1404
01:20:03,921 --> 01:20:08,160
like when I was doing news radio for
a long time, I was not anything new.

1405
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:11,190
I was not putting much effort into comedy
at all. It wasn't excited about it.

1406
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:14,550
I was like, all of a sudden I was on this
TV show and I was like, you know, going,

1407
01:20:14,551 --> 01:20:16,470
wow, I guess I'm doing
TV shows now. You know?

1408
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:19,470
And I'm just still going to kind of
do stand up just to keep it, you know,

1409
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:22,110
that's my base. That's where I started,
but I wasn't passionate about it.

1410
01:20:22,111 --> 01:20:25,950
So for like a good solid two years,
I just didn't write much. I didn't,

1411
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,500
I went on stage and then I
bombed a couple times man.

1412
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:32,460
And I had some people come to see me and
I had a bad set and I realize I'm like,

1413
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:34,680
you know, I am not putting
a lot of effort into this.

1414
01:20:34,681 --> 01:20:38,630
Like this is like some weird shit where
I'm like, I'm doing comedy. Like you know,

1415
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:40,440
recreationally every now and then.

1416
01:20:40,441 --> 01:20:44,130
But I'm known as a comedian so I'm going
up and I'm not having good sets. It's,

1417
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:47,100
they're not tight.
And so I totally read dedicated,

1418
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:52,080
this is like right before my first
album in 1999 and like 96 97 I had,

1419
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:56,640
I had some though. Those are the years,
like 96 97 when I was barely doing comedy,

1420
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:00,180
I'd go up, I'd do a set every now and
then, but I didn't give a shit about it.

1421
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:02,070
It's not even that I didn't
give a shit about it.

1422
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,640
I was just so caught up with the fact
that I was on a television show and that's

1423
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:08,700
where all my effort was going to. It
was, it was one of the first jokes.

1424
01:21:08,701 --> 01:21:12,780
You remember the oldest one had
a gun? Oh, they're all terrible.

1425
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,940
I remember one, I remember
a bad one about, um,

1426
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,590
this is my impression of a good looking
girl getting pulled over by a cop.

1427
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:23,550
Do you realize how fast you're
going? No. Do you like my tits

1428
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,350
daddy?
Yeah,

1429
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:31,710
he has a duty as a warning.
That was one of my earliest bits.

1430
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:35,430
Oh Shit.
One of my other earlier

1431
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,860
that's was Julia child getting
eaten out by a raccoon.

1432
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:40,810
That was like open like date too.

1433
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:49,360
Oh, so stupid. I love
that. That's so dumb.

1434
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:50,530
I mean,
this is silly.

1435
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:53,290
This is the shit that I would think
was funny when I was 21, you know,

1436
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:54,790
this is the,
this is where law came from.

1437
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:59,840
And you know what's funny too is the one
that another major factor was outlawed.

1438
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,030
It was always running through my mind.
I was like,

1439
01:22:01,031 --> 01:22:04,540
how can I ever be as good as Joe?
You know,

1440
01:22:04,541 --> 01:22:08,890
we were talking about we had the same.
We would, if I put some time into,

1441
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:10,300
we would end up being kind of like that.

1442
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:14,760
We talk about the same things and you were
just so good. You, you know, you still,

1443
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:17,200
I mean you're, you're fucking
amazing. It was just like,

1444
01:22:17,201 --> 01:22:19,400
how the fuck can I ever get back on?
I just got to focus on

1445
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:22,980
good to done it and anybody can do it.
It's if you're funny,

1446
01:22:22,981 --> 01:22:24,780
if you're good at comedy
and your objective,

1447
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:30,420
you have a lot of time and you have to
be objective and you have to just focus

1448
01:22:30,421 --> 01:22:32,760
on it and just make it something
that you concentrate on.

1449
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:36,980
You know what helps me the most is I'm
listening to myself and listening to

1450
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,290
tapes and evaluating so important. All
that stuff's so important. You can do it.

1451
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:42,750
Anybody could do it. All you have to do
is just do it. It's just like Jujitsu.

1452
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,690
All you have to do is just put the
energy into it, put the effort into it.

1453
01:22:45,691 --> 01:22:49,290
You'd figure it out and not having a
girlfriend or boyfriend, a boyfriend,

1454
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,570
if you're talking about

1455
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:54,180
if your girl, some girl, if
you're talking about con men here,

1456
01:22:54,181 --> 01:22:58,140
so talking about comics,
I don't necessarily think that's true.

1457
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,033
I think everybody's got

1458
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:02,550
different situation and sometimes it's
good to have a girlfriend because then

1459
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:05,470
you feel like you're, you have comfort.
You know, I know a lot of dudes who,

1460
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:06,140
you know,
the,

1461
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:09,280
the world of standup comedy is like,
you know, it's fucking scary to them.

1462
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:11,800
You know, you're out there on your
own, try to make it, trying to,

1463
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:14,470
having someone that you live with that
supports you to a lot of people that

1464
01:23:14,471 --> 01:23:15,910
gives them energy and strength,
you know?

1465
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:19,390
So a lot of people like they do way better
having a girlfriend or being married,

1466
01:23:19,391 --> 01:23:22,900
everybody's got their own thing.
But if you have a girlfriend,

1467
01:23:22,901 --> 01:23:25,360
she's got to be understanding
that you spend all these time,

1468
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:29,080
all this time at the clubs. You have to
be constantly working almost every night.

1469
01:23:29,081 --> 01:23:30,970
You have to be out doing it,
especially in the beginning.

1470
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:34,810
That will kill the relationship is it
tells your social and that's material,

1471
01:23:34,811 --> 01:23:36,010
right?
Cause your social life,

1472
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,530
but then your social life becomes
like the comedy club world,

1473
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,540
which is when dudes start cannibalizing.

1474
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:44,770
It's what I call cannibalizing is when
a male comedian starts dating a female

1475
01:23:44,771 --> 01:23:47,900
comedian, they become cannibals.
Start eating their own. Yeah.

1476
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,290
As soon as you start doing
that you're fucked. Right.

1477
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:51,820
How many guys have pulled that off?

1478
01:23:51,821 --> 01:23:55,900
There's like three Tommy Segura and his
wife are both hilarious and cool. That's,

1479
01:23:55,901 --> 01:24:00,070
that's that one works. But other than
that, huh? That shit don't work son.

1480
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:03,060
My friend was telling me about when he
broke up with his girlfriend that I,

1481
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:04,810
she's on,
she's on a TV show,

1482
01:24:04,811 --> 01:24:09,000
like a popular TV show and that one
day he was feeling so down and he's,

1483
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:13,510
he comes to his apartment
and his neighbors watching
24 don't say the name of

1484
01:24:13,511 --> 01:24:14,320
this show.

1485
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,550
There's only two girls in that
whole show that's guessing game now.

1486
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:19,421
But like how,

1487
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:22,690
like they had their windows open and he
was just like walking up to his door and

1488
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:26,170
suddenly you heard is I heard a
voice or whatever, like voice,

1489
01:24:26,171 --> 01:24:27,400
just haunting him ever.

1490
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,650
There's billboards when he's
driving around and it was like,

1491
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:32,710
well that kind of sucks living in this
city to the f two one point. Like,

1492
01:24:32,711 --> 01:24:35,860
I only want to date gaffers and
key grips now you now, because I,

1493
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:38,950
I don't want to like date and actors and
have her make it big and then have her

1494
01:24:38,951 --> 01:24:42,750
fucking everywhere I go, I go, you know,
I'm already having problems like that.

1495
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:46,150
Being at the airport right now, you know,
and seeing Whoa, look good. You look good.

1496
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:49,090
Is Lindsay Lohan? You
know, but uh, you know,

1497
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:53,760
I'm talking about how high is this
motherfucker. He's just, yeah,

1498
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,650
you definitely don't want very tricky.

1499
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:01,060
You date Angelina Jolie and
the [inaudible] and she's
on the cover of people

1500
01:25:01,061 --> 01:25:04,410
magazine. Fucking some new
dude. You're like, whoa. Like
that shits at the airport.

1501
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:08,460
That's rough. Yeah, no, he
grips. I just think that my,

1502
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,810
one of the reasons why I think
comics should not take comics,

1503
01:25:10,811 --> 01:25:13,840
why called cannibalism is cause you're
there too much like you, you know,

1504
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:16,300
I don't think that's how a
relationship works out well.

1505
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:18,250
I think relationships work out
well when you're different,

1506
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,710
when you different enjoy each other's
company, but you're different.

1507
01:25:20,711 --> 01:25:24,100
You're two totally different things
when you're both trying to make it as a

1508
01:25:24,101 --> 01:25:26,980
comic man.
Fucking good luck.

1509
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:29,650
Good luck with the balance of
needing this there. You know?

1510
01:25:29,651 --> 01:25:32,350
And I'm not saying I'm a picnic,
I'm not saying any comics a picnic.

1511
01:25:32,351 --> 01:25:35,740
I'm saying a comic in a comic together.
That's like two magnets, you know?

1512
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,290
I mean maybe it'll work.
I mean I would never say it wouldn't work.

1513
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:40,030
Your situation could be
totally different than mine.

1514
01:25:40,031 --> 01:25:42,520
Especially when you're a comic that
and you're in the La comic scene.

1515
01:25:42,521 --> 01:25:46,030
It's pretty tight. So when you break
up your fucking in shows with your ex,

1516
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,790
but that's what our problem
with our friends. We have to,

1517
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:51,730
we have two friends and one
friend broke up with his girl.

1518
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:55,690
Or should I say the girl broke up with
him and, uh, he was very upset by this.

1519
01:25:55,691 --> 01:25:59,680
It was a devastating breakup.
And right afterwards, our friend,

1520
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:04,370
a very good friend, starts dating
this chick and got really creepy,

1521
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:06,880
but ask permission first,
got permission to Fucker,

1522
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,430
which I think is the most hilarious
thing, fucker. Just don't date her.

1523
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:13,040
Like you can't say that,
first of all,

1524
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:14,840
I don't think you can
tell anybody what to do.

1525
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:19,130
And then the guy chose his own medicine
and so, you know, and if for the guy,

1526
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,820
the guy who wound up dating this girl
who was his friend's ex girlfriend,

1527
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,290
you know, for him it's like, well,

1528
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:28,100
here's this perfect person for me
and what I'm supposed to, you know,

1529
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:31,100
I'm supposed to let this go just cause
some other asshole can't get over the

1530
01:26:31,101 --> 01:26:33,200
fact that, you know, come
on man, get over it dude,

1531
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,510
you would hurt it didn't have a thing
together. But I'm in love with her.

1532
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:37,100
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life with her now.

1533
01:26:37,101 --> 01:26:39,800
I can't because you got hurt feelings.
Fuck you.

1534
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:44,100
So I could see his point of view too, but
not me. I could never do it. I would not.

1535
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:47,810
That's to me that there's other women
out there. I don't care how cool she is.

1536
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:50,900
You've got to respect the feelings.
You want to hurt your fucking friend.

1537
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:53,380
You want to hurt your friend over some
pussy. Especially if they were good.

1538
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:57,770
Since I looked at every girl that used
to date one of my friends as a guy,

1539
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:01,520
you only rape. That's it.
Rape Him. No relationships

1540
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:07,630
could only be a one night stand.
Only in the but no, you gotta.

1541
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,230
You gotta say that's off limits forever.

1542
01:27:09,231 --> 01:27:10,610
There's a lot of human
beings in this life.

1543
01:27:10,611 --> 01:27:12,590
You don't want to make someone
upset for no reason. I'm like that.

1544
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:16,550
You could avoid that shit. The problem is
people can decide that this is the one.

1545
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:20,240
He's the one, you know? Especially
if they can't have you bitches. Man.

1546
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:25,250
Do you think that celebrities,
celebrity marriages,

1547
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:30,570
have ended up in divorce at the same
rate as just regular marriages? Way more,

1548
01:27:30,571 --> 01:27:35,360
way more way. You think so? For sure.
People in this city period. That shit son,

1549
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:38,360
let's find out. But I would say yeah,
for sure. It was crazy assholes.

1550
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:42,000
How many Mel Gibson's out there can
keep a fucking marriage. She got out.

1551
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:44,870
How did Mel Gibson's wife
stay with his ass for so long?

1552
01:27:44,871 --> 01:27:49,580
That's what I want to know about. I'll a
lid marriages money. Is that what it is?

1553
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:51,680
And he's not Gibson man.
How do you break up?

1554
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:54,920
Braveheart is worth $1 billion.

1555
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:59,710
Craziest fuck
uh,

1556
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:05,810
whatever. What are you finding? It
just says Duh, Duh. No, just kidding.

1557
01:28:05,811 --> 01:28:09,970
No it doesn't. I haven't found anything
that's kind of a hard guy. Who, well,

1558
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,000
how could you even judge?

1559
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:15,740
I mean it just sent bright percentage
of celebrities break up as opposed to

1560
01:28:15,741 --> 01:28:18,620
percentage of civilians.
Civilians.

1561
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,920
Isn't it weird how um,
like pick the most, uh,

1562
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:29,480
the biggest players of all end up like
rock stars and Super Actors and all that

1563
01:28:30,421 --> 01:28:31,110
shit?

1564
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:34,890
It's like they always end up marrying
and settling down with another celebrity.

1565
01:28:34,891 --> 01:28:38,100
It's like the bitch has got to be a
celebrity or it's not good enough. Right?

1566
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,050
I think it's because first of all,

1567
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:44,160
they get sucked up into that world where
that's who you're hanging around with

1568
01:28:44,161 --> 01:28:46,350
all the time and there's an extra charge.
You know,

1569
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,990
if you're dating some chick and she's
on the cover of sports illustrated like

1570
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:53,310
holy Shit, there's like an extra jolt
to that that people find attractive,

1571
01:28:53,311 --> 01:28:55,800
especially people who are in
that whole celebrity world,

1572
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:59,550
especially guys that can get any normal
non-celebrity chick and then like a

1573
01:28:59,551 --> 01:29:02,090
celebrity chicken. It's
the same with like, you

1574
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:02,280
know,

1575
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:07,280
hot chicks look at celebrity dudes way
differently than just regular dudes.

1576
01:29:07,951 --> 01:29:08,940
That's for damn sure.

1577
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:13,970
I mean routers are saying that 50% while
nearly 50% of a Hollywood marriage or

1578
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:17,640
regular marriages fail that uh,

1579
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,070
70% of Hollywood marriage.

1580
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:25,050
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.
It's the whole idea behind it is,

1581
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:28,920
look, all celebrity is,
is some crazy trick.

1582
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:31,620
You are tricked into thinking
that someone else's special,

1583
01:29:31,621 --> 01:29:33,030
especially if it's celebrity,

1584
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,790
just force a Labor Day just
for the sake of celebrity.

1585
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:37,410
I mean like actors and stuff like that.

1586
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:39,810
I mean there's actors that you
respect because they're talented,

1587
01:29:39,811 --> 01:29:42,120
but it's not like, you know,
like got an author, you know,

1588
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:43,440
like there's a celebrity author,

1589
01:29:43,441 --> 01:29:46,920
like someone whose work was really
profoundly affected you, you know,

1590
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,950
there's something, there's some sort
of a special connection to that.

1591
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,010
It's like you, you have this love for
this guy because of what he's produced.

1592
01:29:53,011 --> 01:29:54,810
Like wow,
you produce some amazing stuff.

1593
01:29:55,230 --> 01:29:58,380
But there's a lot of people that are
famous just because they got on a show and

1594
01:29:58,381 --> 01:30:01,260
then they're just like reading someone's
lines and they're in a movie and

1595
01:30:01,261 --> 01:30:05,430
whatever. It's like, that's
a bizarre, bizarre life.

1596
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:08,670
You know, that life doesn't
make any sense. Like your,

1597
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:12,180
you're treated so much better than
the average person. Rose Garden.

1598
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:16,740
Everybody fucking loves, you
know, Rosebud, Rosebud, Rosebud.

1599
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:17,970
My barrier and the Rosebush.

1600
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:21,660
You talking about Orson Welles
citizen Kane talking about
Mel Gibson. Crazy. Fuck.

1601
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,630
Oh, what did he say to you in the Rose
Garden? Is that what he saying? Yeah,

1602
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:27,330
but what I'm saying is
that, you know, your,

1603
01:30:27,331 --> 01:30:31,770
your whole psychology gets fucking
mangled, you know, you, you know,

1604
01:30:31,771 --> 01:30:34,230
that doesn't make any sense.
So the world doesn't make any sense.

1605
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:36,810
You don't have the right,
your character is wrong.

1606
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:40,200
Your character as a human being is
wrong because the amount of energy that

1607
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:43,980
you're getting for the amount of effort
and that you're putting out is all out

1608
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:45,510
of balance.
You know,

1609
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:47,880
like that's one of the reasons
why celebrities go fucking crazy.

1610
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:51,240
It's because they think the world is
crazy. How could the world not be crazy?

1611
01:30:51,241 --> 01:30:54,390
If you're kissing my ass and I'm driving
a Bentley and I'm making millions and

1612
01:30:54,391 --> 01:30:57,570
people were screaming to
see me everywhere, I go out
there taking photos of me.

1613
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:02,340
That's insane. This world is crazy. Of
course you're going to become crazy too.

1614
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:05,520
But the thing that happens
that I notice is with artists,

1615
01:31:05,521 --> 01:31:08,730
especially when they
become like super famous,

1616
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:13,770
there's like a burst or they can hang in
there for a bit to hang in there for a

1617
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:17,910
few years and keep producing and then
ultimately they just get soft and it

1618
01:31:17,911 --> 01:31:20,670
dwindles off.
Almost like to a person,

1619
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:25,430
almost to a person once their celebrity
like hits that super peak, you know,

1620
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:26,730
they become big and famous.
They can,

1621
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,710
they can hang in there and
produce for a few years,

1622
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,650
but then eventually their
creativity just dries up.

1623
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:35,950
I think it's their connection to the
universe dries up. That's what I think.

1624
01:31:35,951 --> 01:31:38,740
I think they'd lose
appreciation to for life.

1625
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:42,070
They become a Douche bag and then they
just don't have the connection anymore.

1626
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:45,220
That's why all eyes are on
the Double Rainbow Guy. Right.

1627
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:49,630
Like a couple of months he's gonna be
like food that fucking rainbows. Shit.

1628
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:53,840
Double Rainbow.
There's a,

1629
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:58,460
a clip that Jimmy Kimball
twittered and uh, I,

1630
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:00,010
I watched it and it's

1631
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,550
this dude who's seen a rainbow. There's
two rainbows. Yeah, he found it.

1632
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:08,290
He had an MMA fight, seen big fat guy
and he, um, he, everyone's seen what?

1633
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:10,580
Double Rainbow Guy.
He hasn't seen it.

1634
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,030
I haven't heard of that
fucking serious dude.

1635
01:32:13,031 --> 01:32:17,650
You can't say 3 million hits out of 300
million people in this country alone.

1636
01:32:17,651 --> 01:32:21,580
How many in Europe and how many in Asia?
Wow. If you can say everybody. Anyway,

1637
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:22,540
it's fascinating.

1638
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:26,470
This guy just goes crazy when he sees
these rainbows for whatever reason.

1639
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,440
Don't do that. That to shit didn't work.
It was just that video. I wasn't, yeah.

1640
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:35,470
Anyway, this a double rainbow
guy. Famous on that. No,

1641
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:39,550
it's on Brian. Brian's. Brian
could play. I think you can.

1642
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,130
I just don't know how to do it. Do you
know how to drag this shit into Ustream?

1643
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:46,630
Producer Brian? A year two I think you
actually have to have to video, so, oh,

1644
01:32:46,631 --> 01:32:48,670
really? Yeah. All right. Hold on here.

1645
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:53,410
I thought it can show a web page that
you're viewing. All right, here we go.

1646
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:00,183
Okay.

1647
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:05,683
Oh,

1648
01:33:24,450 --> 01:33:26,330
oh God.
Look at that

1649
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:33,070
triple rainbow. Oh my God. Oh,

1650
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:36,390
double rainbow all the way across.

1651
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:49,860
He's crying here by the way. He says
it, knocked him over, knocked him down.

1652
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:51,360
You goes.
At one point I started weeping.

1653
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:57,980
The energy from the rainbow knocked
him down. What does this mean?

1654
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:07,970
What does it mean? It means
mushrooms work. What does it mean,

1655
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:10,740
right?
Oh my God.

1656
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:18,910
Probably the best bill I've ever seen.
I know,

1657
01:34:18,911 --> 01:34:23,290
but this guy sounds like he's got a bag
of Leprechaun gold in his hand while

1658
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:28,060
Christie Brinkley sucking his dick.
I'm just, yeah, there's just a rainbow,

1659
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:31,360
gigantic Ufo, like a hundred yards
above the surface or something

1660
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:32,790
and they're communicating.

1661
01:34:32,791 --> 01:34:36,060
You know what's even better than that is
all the music that has been coming out,

1662
01:34:36,061 --> 01:34:38,400
and I was talking to my
friend the other day, if this,

1663
01:34:38,401 --> 01:34:43,401
this song is so great that I would
actually buy the single off of iTunes and

1664
01:34:43,561 --> 01:34:45,360
that is from some dude
looking at a rainbow.

1665
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:46,680
He explained what song you're talking.
Okay.

1666
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:49,050
There's a couple of these songs
that have come from this video.

1667
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:53,250
[inaudible] song parody is one
that is so good that I would,

1668
01:34:53,490 --> 01:34:56,940
I mean that's like, well let's just,
I don't know which one this is.

1669
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:57,970
Let's see what this one is.
Yeah,

1670
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,530
well this double rainbow dude.

1671
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:07,590
Oh Wow.
Oh Wow.

1672
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:12,040
I like this.
Two rooms.

1673
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:40,120
Sounds like one republic.

1674
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:18,160
There's actually another one that
takes a whole different approach.

1675
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:21,940
That's my kind of like Tim and Eric
Snyder. No, no, no. We don't have here.

1676
01:36:21,941 --> 01:36:23,520
You don't hear more double rainbow songs.

1677
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:27,010
It kind of like scratching that
double double rainbow. You know?

1678
01:36:27,011 --> 01:36:29,340
It's like a whole difference,
but I think that's auto tune.

1679
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:32,470
You can't fuck with that.
You really like on no two songs though.

1680
01:36:32,471 --> 01:36:35,770
That drives me nuts.
I do know when brothers do it,

1681
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:41,650
others do it, but you right, the white
guy in a rock band can do election, man.

1682
01:36:41,651 --> 01:36:45,370
I like, that's what I like about
Biggie, notorious B I g. His,

1683
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:49,810
it was all about the inflection, the way
he would talk and rhyme and punctuate.

1684
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:53,680
You'd never sang. It doesn't
matter. Really can't sing.
I don't want to, you know,

1685
01:36:54,460 --> 01:36:56,920
even when they sing,
if it's auto tune and now really singing,

1686
01:36:57,490 --> 01:37:02,390
I like a little Wayne's out 10 stuff.
Yeah, I like it. I still like it. I like,

1687
01:37:02,391 --> 01:37:04,440
I can do this.
Definitely being overused by,

1688
01:37:04,450 --> 01:37:07,240
I mean there's a lot of music that
uses it nowadays that you know,

1689
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:10,540
most of the time that I think is okay and
it sounds better than hearing Brittany

1690
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:12,970
Spears going like without it,
you know?

1691
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:16,900
Is that what you sounds like
double rainbow guy sounded amazing.

1692
01:37:16,901 --> 01:37:19,800
Can you imagine what Britney Spears
could sound like? What? You know,

1693
01:37:19,870 --> 01:37:21,310
she's already using it, dude. Yeah.

1694
01:37:21,311 --> 01:37:23,790
You could put a lot of shit together
with that for sure. It just,

1695
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:26,950
it just sounds gross to me.
It's missing so much.

1696
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:29,170
I've been really getting
into the black keys lately.

1697
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:32,640
You listen to black keys at all?
Yeah, I downloaded all it. Damn.

1698
01:37:32,650 --> 01:37:35,500
They got some good fucking songs,
man.

1699
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:39,880
I listened to them all the way to a
Ontario Improv every, uh, every night.

1700
01:37:39,881 --> 01:37:43,030
This weekend when I was doing shows there.
Every time I drove up there,

1701
01:37:43,031 --> 01:37:47,170
listen to the black keys. Oh, I'm, this
weekend I'm at, um, before I forget,

1702
01:37:47,171 --> 01:37:49,270
cause I forgot to say at the beginning
of the show. That's the ticket.

1703
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:53,190
I'm at the John Lovitz a comedy
club Saturday night. John Love,

1704
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:55,980
who's my friend that I
never talked to and we did

1705
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,110
a season of news radio. He's a good dude.
I think he's going to come down. Uh,

1706
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:01,370
I doubt it. I don't think he has
anything to do with that place really.

1707
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:04,980
It just hasn't anything. It's like just
his name. I don't know. Just guessing.

1708
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:10,410
[inaudible] um, put my name
up. Dance. He got us the worst.

1709
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:13,450
James Cagney slash John.
Love it. What was the his,

1710
01:38:13,451 --> 01:38:17,520
his character back in the day in Saturday
night live. Who would lie and say,

1711
01:38:17,521 --> 01:38:18,660
that's the ticket,
right?

1712
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:22,860
Any impressions I fucking
suck or use your voice.

1713
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:26,670
Get on the horse.
John Wayne,

1714
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:30,030
he's doing an impression of someone
doing an impression of Peter Fonda.

1715
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:34,630
Peter Fonda,
Jimmy [inaudible].

1716
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:39,630
You're talking about doing an
impression was born after 1960.

1717
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:43,170
Uh,
Ari Shaffir go ahead.

1718
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:51,040
No, no, that was terrible. It's terrible.
He's got already down. Good to it, Joe.

1719
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:54,870
Okay. I joked to an Ra joke, oh,

1720
01:38:55,790 --> 01:39:00,540
you're like plugging along doing
Jewish women, uh, uh, see this.

1721
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,290
This is what I look like.
This is what a Jew looks like.

1722
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:10,740
He's always, that's called a Jew and
wondering what Jewish woman looked like.

1723
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:15,760
Bam. Same thing. Not that good.

1724
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:22,260
Mumble. Mumble. Yeah. The Joey
one. I've got down over decades.

1725
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:24,240
I've only been making fun of Ari.
I can't,

1726
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:32,670
I can't. I wish I could. I
would be doing that. I can't do,

1727
01:39:32,671 --> 01:39:35,400
she used to have a real good Mike Tyson,
but I don't anymore.

1728
01:39:36,490 --> 01:39:41,190
Tyson's kind of easy, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's,

1729
01:39:41,191 --> 01:39:45,020
you know. That's why I never really
liked impressionists because it's,

1730
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:47,610
there's a trick and the trick
is you're like, oh shit.

1731
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:51,570
He sounds just like that guy and
that makes anything extra funny.

1732
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:53,970
It's like it's kind of entertaining.
You put it,

1733
01:39:53,971 --> 01:39:57,290
I can put some good material on
top. Doctor Steve Berle. All right.

1734
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:00,490
At least I could a couple of weeks
ago can, I might've lost it. Lost it.

1735
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:04,050
Come on here. Wait, nevermind.
I have to hear it. No, no, no,

1736
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:08,580
not do it at that to Steve Brule. Hey,
you got some vinegar on your driveway?

1737
01:40:08,590 --> 01:40:12,420
Just put some vinegar on it. Don't be
stupid. That sounds like Max Eberly. Hey,

1738
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:15,570
you know you might be a
little knee his friend,

1739
01:40:15,571 --> 01:40:17,700
but who cares about all that dumb.
They could look at my dangerous,

1740
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:21,570
it sounded like that shit means a
standup comedian on South Pole. He put,

1741
01:40:21,571 --> 01:40:23,820
my dad gets on there.
All the girls went to see my dad.

1742
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:27,050
I don't even know who he all, I don't know
who you're talking about. Who's doctor?

1743
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:30,550
Steve Berle back to [inaudible].
John [inaudible]. Riley.

1744
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,630
I'm a little bit, then it
sounded a little bit, you guys,

1745
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:39,790
if you went on to be with me, you
gotta come over here. I'm doc,

1746
01:40:39,791 --> 01:40:43,230
just put some milk on it. Get some
table kicked please. I'm not too bad.

1747
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:48,260
I kind of an impression.
I kind of understand that
you're doing an impression.

1748
01:40:48,261 --> 01:40:51,480
It's not terrible. I'll try harder
next time. I'm rooting for you.

1749
01:40:51,481 --> 01:40:54,280
So I'm doing all impressions

1750
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:57,550
though. Like when you see like someone's
act, they do like all impressions.

1751
01:40:57,551 --> 01:41:00,790
That drives me fucking nuts.
I don't want to see that.

1752
01:41:00,791 --> 01:41:04,240
Especially when like all of them sound
the same and they're only really good at

1753
01:41:04,241 --> 01:41:08,310
the really ups like, Oh, this is
pachino. Yeah. You know, it was good.

1754
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:11,200
Really good impressions as Jay Moore.
Holy Shit.

1755
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:16,201
Have you ever heard was calling him his
Collin Quinn is fucking brilliant and

1756
01:41:16,451 --> 01:41:19,150
uh, his walking is really good too.
He's got a really good walking.

1757
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:20,240
A lot of duties.

1758
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:24,050
Oh, I got one. I got one impression,
but no one would know it. But um,

1759
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,560
there was a German thrash band
and the 80s called Creator.

1760
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:32,590
They're probably still around and they
barely spoken English and I'm not even

1761
01:41:33,811 --> 01:41:38,270
gonna do it. It's terrible. That's
terrible. Well, I'm sorry. It's hard to,

1762
01:41:38,271 --> 01:41:40,250
I'm going to do harm or do
it. Yeah, go ahead man. Okay.

1763
01:41:40,251 --> 01:41:43,550
There's my favorite creators
song was called the pestilence.

1764
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:47,240
They don't know any English, so there's
not too much banter in between songs.

1765
01:41:48,290 --> 01:41:49,123
So here it comes.

1766
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:54,590
You just killed.

1767
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:59,750
Why was it so loud? That was the
pestilence. That's all I can do.

1768
01:42:00,090 --> 01:42:01,740
Pretty God.
Damn good version of that.

1769
01:42:02,330 --> 01:42:03,163
No idea.

1770
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:10,190
That's get it together.
Cock sucker.

1771
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:13,120
The Cock sucker.
You blew my fuck.

1772
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:17,540
I'm smoking a bone with the cat.
Trying to enjoy my off time.

1773
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:20,990
Even Dr Jay could have helped me listen
until a little fucking podcast and now

1774
01:42:20,991 --> 01:42:25,600
I've got crackles in my speakers. Cock
sucker. Okay. You know what we could do?

1775
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:29,970
We can do, uh, since Joey's not here with
us, he was supposed to be here with us.

1776
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:32,550
Let's talk about UFC Oakland,
right?

1777
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,920
And you give us your
predictions. Joey Karate, UFC,

1778
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:41,110
Oakland jail Sonnen versus Anderson Silva.
The spider.

1779
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:45,250
The spider is in the house and chill.
Son's got a can of raid cock sucker.

1780
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:49,660
Shit's going to get crazy chill.
Sonnen's going to look for that double,

1781
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:53,680
double wide, double leg, whatever.
Look for that fucking takedown.

1782
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,530
But the spider's got those knees,
motherfucker.

1783
01:42:56,680 --> 01:43:00,460
He comes up with them like Oj Simpson
in that fucking hurts commercial.

1784
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:05,480
Those knees. It's called. It has
gone. I'm, he's going to put up

1785
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:10,420
Carla Ricardo, meda,
Henzel Gracie revenge.

1786
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:12,040
Henzel Gracie revenge.

1787
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:17,050
Cocksucker Ricardo are made a student
of the Great Henzel Gracie victim of

1788
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:20,500
Matthews. Matthews. Standup
performance leg kicks,

1789
01:43:20,501 --> 01:43:24,690

in UFC history. But Ricardo,

1790
01:43:24,691 --> 01:43:26,410

1791
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,780
Big Dog back his back for
more big dog is gonna fuck.

1792
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,610
Start out with an inside leg kick
right to the balls on purpose. Sorry.

1793
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:34,690
Much respect.

01:43:38,651 --> 01:43:43,310
Breakfast Cock sucker mad use
with the fucking ground and pound.

1797
01:43:43,330 --> 01:43:45,500
He's the godfather of it.
Respect.

1798
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:49,360
Respect to the godfather
around growth is on the card.

1799
01:43:49,550 --> 01:43:52,460
Uh, big, big and junior. Dos Santos,

1800
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:53,690
respect that gut.

1801
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:57,830
Big countries come and dropping
bombs on your mom's fuck car alarms.

1802
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:03,830
Big country is the best fat men fighting
in the UFC today. No one even close.

1803
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:04,740
What's his,

1804
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:08,190
what's his name that just knocked up
that just knocked out tight? Todd Duffy.

1805
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:11,000
Mike [inaudible].
Mike Russo is a close second,

1806
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:12,860
but big countries right up in there.

1807
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:15,320
Big country would have done it with the
first punch. That's a difference though.

1808
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,540
Don't let that fucking big GI Joe Looking.

1809
01:44:17,541 --> 01:44:21,770
Motherfucker beat on you for three rounds.
Land that punch early. Learn respect.

1810
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:25,880
Um, Roy Nelson. Oh, junior dos Santos Sto.

1811
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:30,380
Any motherfucker willing to go outside
with those ears? That's a tough dude.

1812
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:34,930
I do. Doesn't give a fuck.
He's got a mouse living in
his left ear. He feeds him.

1813
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:37,280
It keeps him company in between rounds.

1814
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:43,940
Oh, he's working all fucking squirrel and
his right one. You know what I'm saying?

1815
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:45,440
Junior dos Santos.

1816
01:44:46,010 --> 01:44:49,070
Let me tell you something for breezy over
dooms ears are still wiggling from the

1817
01:44:49,071 --> 01:44:51,980
last time though. Santo's hit him.
He hit him with that upper cut.

1818
01:44:51,981 --> 01:44:54,950
He started tuning into 97
one the ff park station.

1819
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:57,373
Fucking,

1820
01:44:57,380 --> 01:45:01,220
he heard a system morning and then alarm
clock started going off in his head.

1821
01:45:01,221 --> 01:45:04,370
All right. That's how hard junior
dos Santos hits. Who knows?

1822
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:07,370
It's the fat man against the banger
with a mouse living in his ears.

1823
01:45:07,371 --> 01:45:08,900
It's a Goddamn Tarzan movie.

1824
01:45:09,550 --> 01:45:13,200
Got His weight and who else?
Oh,

1825
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:16,430
Tiago Alvarez coming up against my man,
John Fitch.

1826
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:21,230
The grinder comes out of the same Johnny
Cash song. God's going to cut you down,

1827
01:45:21,231 --> 01:45:24,800
bitch, and we tell some Tiago Alva is
going to try to cut you down to that.

1828
01:45:24,801 --> 01:45:27,500
Mother fucker's got glue in his brain.
You hear what I'm saying?

1829
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:30,530
Somebody stuck glue in his
brain and he don't give a fuck.

1830
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,470
He wants revenge.

1831
01:45:34,471 --> 01:45:36,860
She's a totally different animal
from the first time you guys met.

1832
01:45:36,861 --> 01:45:37,940
He wants revenge,

1833
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:40,880
but John Fitch chain here in at John
Fitch at different animal as well.

1834
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:44,690
He's got his black belt from Dave
Camera, Rio, Brazilian Jujitsu.

1835
01:45:44,691 --> 01:45:47,990
Go Willa style ready to take them down.
Grind it out.

1836
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:50,570
It's a fucking battle to the finish.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1837
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:54,920
Tiago Alvarez leg kicks and John Fitch
with elbows to your fucking head.

1838
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:58,700
I'm getting fired up. Where's my blood
pressure medication? I'm fired up.

1839
01:45:58,701 --> 01:45:59,630
Just listen to this.

1840
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:05,620
So beautiful. Oh, that was wonderful.
For those of you that I don't know,

1841
01:46:05,621 --> 01:46:08,140
Tony Deals,

1842
01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:12,260
an MMA review or UFC review and a preview.

1843
01:46:12,470 --> 01:46:15,200
It's called 10th Planet Kush.
Joe Is just the best.

1844
01:46:15,201 --> 01:46:18,200
No one can predict fights better
than it's so entertaining.

1845
01:46:18,230 --> 01:46:21,410
The most hilarious person I've
ever met in my whole life,

1846
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:24,290
like just for hanging out with
them. Nobody's funnier. I know.

1847
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:27,980
Just a regular basis over everything,
about everything,

1848
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:31,840
about anything he could read. He just
read a book. You can pick up a book.

1849
01:46:31,841 --> 01:46:34,700
It would just start reading it and
it'd be funny. I love that guy.

1850
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:38,390
He could talk about anything. You
could have Joey and just, you know,

1851
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:42,140
turn on the news. Here's
Lindsay Lohan. What do you
think? Cause this motherfucker,

1852
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:45,860
somebody did have proper and he would
just go off about Lindsay Lohan and the

1853
01:46:45,861 --> 01:46:49,620
jokes and start flowing the other day.
Me and when when you were on stage,

1854
01:46:49,621 --> 01:46:50,160
me and Joey

1855
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,770
were way too stone and so we were just
sitting in the green room looking at it.

1856
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:56,730
Thanks. And then he's like, I'm gonna have
to start a podcast. And I'm like, what?

1857
01:46:56,731 --> 01:46:58,590
And he's like, do you got any other
recorders? And I'm like, all right,

1858
01:46:58,591 --> 01:47:01,650
let's do a podcast. So we're
going to, we record a 10 minutes.

1859
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:04,500
We're just gonna like throw these
podcasts anytime we're together.

1860
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:07,680
And it's just called cats and it's
just me and him talking about cash.

1861
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:13,250
That's beautiful man. I tell you about
Captain Samurai, Captain Samurai.

1862
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:14,200
It lives in my back yard.

1863
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:16,940
He's got scratches on his face and he
looks like Bruce Leave from enter the

1864
01:47:16,941 --> 01:47:20,180
dragon number when he came out and
the guy hit him with the claw. Yeah,

1865
01:47:20,181 --> 01:47:24,400
that's my cat. He's got like nine
cats. Right? Check out the episode.

1866
01:47:24,410 --> 01:47:27,440
He actually has nine cats to outside.
Oh, let's tell, tell people how to,

1867
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:32,500
what does it just pull the seventh planet
Kush Kush and go to episode 15 and 16

1868
01:47:32,931 --> 01:47:37,190
those are Joey at his best. 15 and
1610 pennant Kush. His name is,

1869
01:47:37,191 --> 01:47:40,490
his character has a UFC review characters.
Joey karate,

1870
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:45,460
but his real name is Joey Diaz.
It's fucking priceless. Yeah.

1871
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:48,650
Joey's always with me on the road. I
think he's coming with me Saturday night.

1872
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:50,750
I've got to ask him.
I think he's coming on Saturday night.

1873
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:54,680
It doesn't have anything else booked.
Uh, at the John Lovitz comedy club,

1874
01:47:54,681 --> 01:47:58,400
but he did all weekend in Ontario. He's,
he's just the funniest dude. I know.

1875
01:47:58,460 --> 01:48:01,790
It's just so fun to hang around with.
He always brings an element of the party,

1876
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:05,450
you know, like whenever we do shows
without Joey, there's still fun as fuck.

1877
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:08,540
But there's something about having Joey
around and just, he, he brings the party,

1878
01:48:08,541 --> 01:48:10,970
you know, the party starts
with Joey gets there, you know,

1879
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,170
cause he don't give a fuck. Yeah.
He's like the ultimate flavor.

1880
01:48:15,171 --> 01:48:19,700
Flave but funny. Yeah. You know. Well
I got funny flavor. Flave you know,

1881
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:22,460
it's just like,
he's just the ultimate hilarious dude.

1882
01:48:22,910 --> 01:48:25,970
Do you think the gay people
have flashlights smoothies
where after they're done

1883
01:48:25,971 --> 01:48:28,370
with their flashlights to just put a straw
in it and like walk around the house?

1884
01:48:28,371 --> 01:48:30,000
It's an out of the hole.
Oh Dude.

1885
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:34,710
Brian,
Brian,

1886
01:48:35,530 --> 01:48:39,260
this we, I'm sure you can just Google it,
I'm sure, but what would it be? Flexible.

1887
01:48:39,530 --> 01:48:43,920
There's gotta be some
low out of flashlights.

1888
01:48:44,450 --> 01:48:47,320
Google that. All video.
Now, what's the latest?

1889
01:48:47,410 --> 01:48:51,910
What's the latest with the real doll
pipe technology. They hit a wall.

1890
01:48:51,970 --> 01:48:52,660
They hit a wall.

1891
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:55,990
They hit a wall apparently according
to Chris to do to worse at flashlight.

1892
01:48:56,710 --> 01:49:01,270
The Vagina in the real doll is hard and
not comfortable. It doesn't feel good.

1893
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:04,630
Does it feel like the flashlight?
Listen man,

1894
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:08,200
I don't need to be fucking some
rubber doll. I know it's not a person.

1895
01:49:08,201 --> 01:49:09,790
I'm not pretending.
Okay.

1896
01:49:09,791 --> 01:49:13,420
A fleshlight to me is perfect just and
it doesn't have to look like a vagina

1897
01:49:13,421 --> 01:49:16,480
either. Stop. Just make it a whole.
All right, so I don't feel it.

1898
01:49:17,470 --> 01:49:21,010
That's making it a hole. Did I stick
my dick in and I shoot a load into,

1899
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:25,060
I don't need to fuck some fake doll and
do it doggy style and put her hands on

1900
01:49:25,061 --> 01:49:27,940
my balls and shit. I don't need
that. That's just gross. To me.

1901
01:49:27,941 --> 01:49:30,700
That's even more gross.
It's like you're pretending it's a person.

1902
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,690
I'm not pretending it's a person. I'm just
trying to shoot a load here. All right.

1903
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:36,610
Pretending it's a person. There's just
something about a fleshlight that's like,

1904
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:40,580
that you put on like a head,
like, like a one of those helmets.

1905
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:44,290
Like helmet you see like a dick,
but it's not yours.

1906
01:49:44,291 --> 01:49:48,160
Obviously you see it and whatever
that girl in that virtual

1907
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,030
reality world,

1908
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:52,360
like she's suck like that flashlight
that you to have it like moves on the

1909
01:49:52,361 --> 01:49:55,120
inside. It's like controlling. And
if you'd like a mouth, it grabs your,

1910
01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:59,080
you know what I mean? It's the exact same
stroke, Ej, you know, if it's going up,

1911
01:49:59,290 --> 01:50:00,101
how cool would that be?

1912
01:50:00,101 --> 01:50:04,540
I would use that shit program would
pay like 900 bucks for that. Yeah.

1913
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:08,590
What helmets x, like Dan and they
had a code and that code would,

1914
01:50:08,830 --> 01:50:13,750
would transmit to the, uh, the fleshlight
say if you add, uh, each video,

1915
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:15,310
each video was coded,
you know,

1916
01:50:15,311 --> 01:50:17,890
so you would take someone and they
would figure out how to program into the

1917
01:50:17,891 --> 01:50:19,270
computer so that the,
the,

1918
01:50:19,271 --> 01:50:22,320
the hands or whatever the fuck
mechanical thing that you would have that

1919
01:50:22,321 --> 01:50:26,590
controls to the movement on the fleshlight
would move in conjunction with what's

1920
01:50:26,591 --> 01:50:29,330
on the screen. It would be like
a, uh, a basic computer pro.

1921
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:32,470
So like if you're out of town, your
wife could send, make a video for you.

1922
01:50:32,471 --> 01:50:34,070
She could send it,
you plug it in.

1923
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:37,960
Then how did someone
interpret what she's doing?

1924
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,480
She can make a video me
jerking off another dude.

1925
01:50:40,481 --> 01:50:45,330
What the fuck are we have to
be? You turn off you? Yeah.

1926
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:46,700
Yeah.
You would ever have to be,

1927
01:50:46,710 --> 01:50:48,940
could it be live or you'd
have to be really open minded

1928
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:54,430
guy so I could see and I'll just jerk
off and them it's way better than just

1929
01:50:54,431 --> 01:50:58,680
porn. Yeah. Some to do that.
Some something's ready guys.

1930
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:02,800
Why don't you guys fuck their
wives? Have you seen idiocracy? No,

1931
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:06,490
I keep hearing about it.
No, I haven't done so much.

1932
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:12,040
It's so much shit that people said that.
Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people. Oh dude,

1933
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:14,380
it's so, but it's good.
It's by Mike Judge.

1934
01:51:14,381 --> 01:51:17,320
But that's not an idea
that is uniquely mine.

1935
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:19,360
The idea that people are getting dumber.
I think anybody,

1936
01:51:19,361 --> 01:51:21,940
everybody who's paying attention
thinks that people are getting dumber.

1937
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:25,420
Like a lot of people getting smarter,
but a lot more getting dumber, you know?

1938
01:51:25,421 --> 01:51:27,700
And this is not just like,
you know, when I was a kid,

1939
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:29,530
people were smarter and
all that grandpa bullshit.

1940
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:32,830
There was a fact that I read on
the Internet that the average kid,

1941
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:37,890
high school kid in 1960 had 200 more
words in their vocabulary than the average

1942
01:51:38,531 --> 01:51:41,560
kid in 2010 what was the first year?

1943
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:46,390
1960 yeah. I don't know if it's true.
What about the new words that are add?

1944
01:51:46,391 --> 01:51:48,730
Like with Ebonics and all that
stuff and I'll slang words.

1945
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:51,670
There's a lot of new shit.
Yeah. Do those count though?

1946
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:54,520
They're not in the dictionary.
They don't count how the dictionary,

1947
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:58,560
how popular to something I have to
be before it gets in there. No, no,

1948
01:51:58,630 --> 01:52:01,090
because I know there's a lot of words
that you would think would be in there by

1949
01:52:01,091 --> 01:52:04,690
now. You know? Quick. How about getting
knuckles and with the explosion?

1950
01:52:04,691 --> 01:52:08,140
Remember Joey, I thought Joey was the
only one doing it. Did I make that up? No,

1951
01:52:08,141 --> 01:52:12,280
I thought he made it, but then
everyone started those things.

1952
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:15,640
It was like six years ago
I bought Zoe made it up.

1953
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:18,190
What if he did and he just didn't know it?

1954
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:20,680
I don't think so because now you
see it in movies all the time.

1955
01:52:20,890 --> 01:52:23,660
Everybody's doing it. I hate doing it
now because it feels sent don. Yeah,

1956
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:28,250
I do it when we get off. If I do it
all the time before it was popular.

1957
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:30,640
Yeah. We do that all the time.
We get on stage, but you know,

1958
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:33,100
I feel like one part of me says that,
yeah,

1959
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:35,320
don't do it because everybody else
is doing and then the party, he says,

1960
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:38,650
who's who gives a fuck spending
the shaking hands. Hey,
but I do it backwards. Now.

1961
01:52:38,651 --> 01:52:42,120
If you start with the explosion
and then you go tuned to the fist,

1962
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:44,530
that's two creative. You're
trying too hard. It's better.

1963
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:48,590
That's the editor in Saudi. It doesn't
make sense to me to make sense to me.

1964
01:52:48,591 --> 01:52:52,660
I want to touch them out
goals and then there's an
explosion. Hey, what's up? Boom.

1965
01:52:52,910 --> 01:52:56,030
Hey, what's up? Boom. You're not
going to sell that. That's not,

1966
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:59,480
that's how that could work, ma'am. You've
got 2000 people on the want to do it.

1967
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:01,340
If you want to do it, go right
ahead, but I think you're,

1968
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:03,890
what if I do it to you and you do it the
other way? I think you're out of line.

1969
01:53:04,490 --> 01:53:07,290
I think you need to abandon this. I
like the faggy. What do you got like

1970
01:53:09,410 --> 01:53:13,340
I like to do that one. I
like that one. No problem.

1971
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:17,450
No problem with dudes. Squish my
fingers. When dude shake your hand.

1972
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:18,210
Shake your hand.

1973
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:22,160
I want to touch the finger tip thing
where they go around the fingertip and

1974
01:53:22,161 --> 01:53:23,870
cross your fingers like what?
Are you

1975
01:53:26,690 --> 01:53:29,900
nervous? Do you think that? I don't
know what it is they're doing,

1976
01:53:29,901 --> 01:53:33,080
but if I grab someone's hand
and it's like they got it wrong,

1977
01:53:33,110 --> 01:53:35,600
I let let up and try to like rejects it,

1978
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:37,550
let's fix you don't like
that nervous hand Jews.

1979
01:53:37,551 --> 01:53:39,710
I'm really getting paranoid
about people's hands and stuff.

1980
01:53:39,711 --> 01:53:42,050
Like our friend went to the
apple store the other day,

1981
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:45,140
they totally saved his life and he was
just talking about how these guys are

1982
01:53:45,141 --> 01:53:47,960
just life like his hard
drive crashed and they,

1983
01:53:47,961 --> 01:53:51,500
the guy who just went right on right
on that on the computer and he was just

1984
01:53:51,501 --> 01:53:55,460
saying like how he was doing it
and how gross his keyboard was,

1985
01:53:55,461 --> 01:53:59,120
but the guy did not even
flinch and touched it and I
was thinking how many apple

1986
01:53:59,590 --> 01:54:03,650
employees like girlfriends get pregnant
from really bad fingering because they

1987
01:54:03,651 --> 01:54:05,600
might,
their hands must be like pregnant.

1988
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:08,270
You know how much fucking calm
has to be on all those girls.

1989
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:11,420
Fucking fingers can't survive.

1990
01:54:12,830 --> 01:54:15,570
My keyboard has so much shit on it.
He said he didn't believe it.

1991
01:54:16,710 --> 01:54:19,730
That's obviously don't think
anyone's getting pregnant,

1992
01:54:19,731 --> 01:54:22,340
but you know how much comments on your
hands after you work at an apple store.

1993
01:54:22,341 --> 01:54:25,520
How about none? No one's coming
in their keyboard. Brian. Ah,

1994
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:26,960
you don't ever masturbated.

1995
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:30,080
He never masturbating and wiped it on a
towel and you still had a little bit of

1996
01:54:30,081 --> 01:54:33,940
come around the corner and you fucking
start typing your bit to income. Dude,

1997
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,950
you don't let it go to waste to what

1998
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:41,860
this show has gone down hill hard.

1999
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:45,230
We're talking about fingering loads.
Brian,

2000
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:50,300
you hijack this goddamn shirt you hijack
to show with this crazy story about

2001
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:53,360
getting people pregnant from
touching keyboards on a banana.

2002
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:55,340
You're only out of banana.
Oh,

2003
01:54:55,460 --> 01:55:00,230
Brian is on this crazy fucking diet where
he's trying to lose 35 pounds and he

2004
01:55:00,231 --> 01:55:03,770
won't shave until he loses the weight.
So he's got this Muslim beard.

2005
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:07,980
He's rocking right now and he still
has how many pounds ago? Oh, well,

2006
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:11,960
I'm down 19 pounds since June 18th
and the way he's doing it is obviously

2007
01:55:11,970 --> 01:55:16,940
unhealthy. It's rotting and well, you're
the ones that can be a protein bar.

2008
01:55:16,950 --> 01:55:20,150
I forgot though.
How crazy is it?

2009
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:25,970
Just by 19 pounds. All the hot
chicks that are just bombing you.

2010
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:28,250
I think that's amazing man.
Just like just like that.

2011
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:31,910
You've got all these girls all over. You
got this last one when he was fat? Yeah,

2012
01:55:31,911 --> 01:55:35,510
I know. And now he's got dude, it's
incredible. I, you know what props bro,

2013
01:55:35,670 --> 01:55:40,070
you gotta I've never seen.
What do you attribute your
attractive institute? Brian,

2014
01:55:40,071 --> 01:55:42,830
do you believe it's your sense of humor?
I still suck my thumb still.

2015
01:55:42,831 --> 01:55:44,310
My get big by their own.

2016
01:55:49,330 --> 01:55:50,250
Their own.
I like that.

2017
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:54,570
Brian is like the oldest
child I've ever met

2018
01:55:54,630 --> 01:55:56,550
my life.
You really,

2019
01:55:56,551 --> 01:55:59,460
he reminds me of like friends that
I had when I was in eighth grade.

2020
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:02,660
Like never grow up. You always stay
with you when you got molested.

2021
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:03,503
What eighth grade

2022
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:09,760
fuck are you laughing at?
So that's wrong.

2023
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:14,220
What do you think chicks dig in you if
you had to guess that real personality.

2024
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:14,760
Definitely.

2025
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:19,760
I am like real person and I opened
doors for him and stuff like that.

2026
01:56:19,950 --> 01:56:23,790
Good cleanup. God come in after the
Douche bags. Right, right, right.

2027
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:25,720
And maybe I think guy,

2028
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:29,490
I think you're amazing success lately.

2029
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:33,000
It's only been on the last like a
month where it's been incredible.

2030
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:38,160
I think it's because chicks like
cats, you love cats. Seriously.

2031
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:42,480
Think about that. Think about the cat
thing. I don't think that's it though.

2032
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,850
Because actually most of the chicks,
I hate cats.

2033
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:49,260
Once you date one pretty girl that all
of a sudden other girls can smell it.

2034
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:51,460
What is your name? He realized it. Look,

2035
01:56:51,461 --> 01:56:54,510
see you out with a pretty girl and
like look at this bad motherfucker.

2036
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:57,120
I want him now. How did
he get her? I think that,

2037
01:56:57,150 --> 01:57:02,010
I think a lot of it and this city is
just people fucking like taking care of

2038
01:57:02,011 --> 01:57:06,330
girls because like I know so many girls
that I talked to their boyfriends or

2039
01:57:06,331 --> 01:57:09,210
like, you know, fucking freaking
out about all of garden.

2040
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,840
Like you know like can you pay
this? Can you, you know, like they,

2041
01:57:11,930 --> 01:57:13,470
they don't get taken on dates,
you know,

2042
01:57:13,471 --> 01:57:16,380
they don't get treated like how they
want to be treated out here because

2043
01:57:16,381 --> 01:57:18,090
everyone's trying to survive out here.

2044
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:20,850
Girl, I saw you with last
week. I swear to God,

2045
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:23,940
I swear to God I didn't see what that
would have thought she was Jessica Alba.

2046
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:25,440
You know what I'm saying?
And I'm like,

2047
01:57:25,441 --> 01:57:27,600
what the fuck is going
on with Brian Vegas?

2048
01:57:27,601 --> 01:57:29,910
Like I'm seriously thinking about
getting a cat. I'm not even kidding.

2049
01:57:29,930 --> 01:57:33,210
I'm not even kidding. Strong words
cause Eddie doesn't even like cats.

2050
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:35,450
I like cats.
I,

2051
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:41,140
my new one's pretty sweet man.
The grind of fucking relationships.

2052
01:57:41,141 --> 01:57:42,670
Finding someone,
Brian,

2053
01:57:42,671 --> 01:57:46,250
you're single man right now was I feel
like it was fucking great. Doesn't it?

2054
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:48,760
Until you clean out your iPhone
of old pictures and you're like,

2055
01:57:48,820 --> 01:57:53,650
oh Luca doesn't his kits. I need an I
break up for apple. Once you break up,

2056
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:58,580
if the text by face your ex girlfriend
and it destroys everything or puts it in,

2057
01:57:58,910 --> 01:58:01,510
we'll go back together next week.
She goes to Jews. I break up,

2058
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:02,950
they got time machine

2059
01:58:06,850 --> 01:58:11,110
time machine and I break up and go back
breakup. We were only taking a break.

2060
01:58:11,170 --> 01:58:14,870
We were breaking up right
now easier.

2061
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:17,140
There's easy it is to
just flip them at the,

2062
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:21,250
which the craziness argument you've
gotten a chick with recently, recently,

2063
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:24,970
recently over the last 10 years
of your life? 10 years craziest.

2064
01:58:25,090 --> 01:58:30,080
I'll just give him some room so the girls
don't know he's talking about them. Uh,

2065
01:58:30,110 --> 01:58:32,210
last,
I know you've had some doozies getting,

2066
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:35,710
got some doozies getting a tattoo behind
my ear of a heart or something like

2067
01:58:35,711 --> 01:58:37,840
that. Yeah. This one girl I dated,

2068
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:41,620
she wanted within the third week she to,

2069
01:58:41,621 --> 01:58:45,850
I get matching tattoos behind
her ears and I'm like already,

2070
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,000
we've only been dating for three weeks.
And she goes, she goes, if you've got me.

2071
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:51,250
And I'm like, wow. Was like,
okay, that sounds good.

2072
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:54,160
Cause I was thinking I'll just get it
lasered off, you know, whatever happens.

2073
01:58:54,161 --> 01:58:56,170
But like we were really
close to actually doing that.

2074
01:58:56,200 --> 01:59:00,070
How much do you regret not doing?
Wow. Huh? Do you know? I uh,

2075
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:01,540
I don't think I would ever do it.

2076
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:04,270
I think if help is actually on
the way to the Tattoo Studio,

2077
01:59:04,271 --> 01:59:07,360
I would have just like chloroform or
something like that in terms of that.

2078
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:11,200
But what if you know you were in the
moment and she went first and you're

2079
01:59:11,201 --> 01:59:16,201
getting and you had a couple of Japanese
is spoken a little sign on top of doing

2080
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:21,070
it. I could see you doing it. Laughing
about it. I tell you we do that.

2081
01:59:21,130 --> 01:59:21,890
That's so crazy.

2082
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:22,690
No,
she wanted a mark.

2083
01:59:22,690 --> 01:59:26,010
You see so many women when you
get involved in relationships,

2084
01:59:26,011 --> 01:59:27,660
we want to make sure that you're for real.

2085
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:31,020
Yeah. You want to make sure you're like
a test for real. You in it for real.

2086
01:59:31,110 --> 01:59:33,510
Are you in it for real?
For Real? Yeah. How about,

2087
01:59:33,570 --> 01:59:35,220
I was talking about this
on my message board today.

2088
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:39,180
How about dudes who fucking share
a Facebook page with their wife?

2089
01:59:39,450 --> 01:59:41,370
Some fucking guy sent me a message.

2090
01:59:41,371 --> 01:59:44,850
You know it's like Bob and Jennifer
Mckella Han and I'm like, what?

2091
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:49,770
You share a Facebook page with a chick?
I have this ex girlfriend that I love.

2092
01:59:49,771 --> 01:59:51,530
She's a great person to
talk to and stuff by.

2093
01:59:51,531 --> 01:59:55,830
Her fucking husband is addicted to
Farmville. So like all day long,

2094
01:59:55,831 --> 01:59:58,440
it's Farmville, this mafia
wars, this. And I'm just like,

2095
01:59:58,441 --> 02:00:00,540
I'm like texting her or
sending her a message, like,

2096
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:04,470
would you fucking stop like telling me
how much oranges you have and stuff like,

2097
02:00:04,471 --> 02:00:07,130
and go, okay, this is somebody,

2098
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:11,970
I'm sorry this is so and so's
boyfriend or husband. Uh, she,

2099
02:00:11,971 --> 02:00:14,100
do you want to talk to her?
And I'm like, no, I can't.

2100
02:00:14,101 --> 02:00:17,810
You just have your separate fucking
Farmville account and just get out of her.

2101
02:00:18,590 --> 02:00:23,460
I'm so confused. The farm each other's
messages on Facebook like, hey,

2102
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:25,380
someone's Heather or fuck.

2103
02:00:27,870 --> 02:00:32,500
So it's so, so and so. You're
the worst. What? Dunkin?

2104
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:37,500
Yeah. So, so, and so, uh, just got
a brand new horse in their stable,

2105
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:40,410
you know, like a teller. So every
time you play this game at updates,

2106
02:00:40,411 --> 02:00:45,300
your Facebook updates your Facebook
automatically. Oh my God, that's so good.

2107
02:00:45,301 --> 02:00:49,080
And they share inboxes
together. It's like, dude, you
don't have any life anywhere.

2108
02:00:49,081 --> 02:00:52,140
I can't. What if I just wanted to send,
Oh, you look cute in that one picture.

2109
02:00:52,141 --> 02:00:53,290
He goes, dude sent me anything, an email

2110
02:00:53,290 --> 02:00:57,790
message on Facebook and the message was
he came to the Ontario show and he said,

2111
02:00:57,830 --> 02:00:59,080
I saw your show.

2112
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:03,670
Did you ever consider the possibility
that Jesus was real and that he was who he

2113
02:01:03,671 --> 02:01:07,930
says he was and I automatically
dismissed him? I'm like, first of all,

2114
02:01:07,931 --> 02:01:09,340
it's a silly question and second of all,

2115
02:01:09,490 --> 02:01:12,430
how can I debate a guy who's got a
fucking Facebook page with his wife? Like,

2116
02:01:12,431 --> 02:01:15,010
you're on your own dude.
Good luck. Have a good time.

2117
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:16,570
But we can't have any conversations.

2118
02:01:16,930 --> 02:01:19,960
I can't have a serious conversation
about anything. I mean,

2119
02:01:19,961 --> 02:01:22,880
even if you're like goddamn scholar
and you know and you know and you're,

2120
02:01:22,881 --> 02:01:26,390
you're a brilliant person and knows a lot
about the history of the, you know, the,

2121
02:01:26,391 --> 02:01:29,260
the I, the origins of Jesus. I
can't talk to you about that.

2122
02:01:29,261 --> 02:01:33,430
You got to fucking Facebook page with the
chick, dude. Does that drive you nuts?

2123
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:38,740
Give a call girl or a dude rather.
And his girlfriend answers the phone.

2124
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:40,160
What the fuck

2125
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:42,740
is that? Oh, what is that?

2126
02:01:43,730 --> 02:01:46,430
That's the guy trying to prove his love.
Yeah.

2127
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:51,860
My password to my Facebook, I
swear I call it, you know what,

2128
02:01:51,861 --> 02:01:54,110
that's probably like getting
back together type shit.

2129
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:57,080
Girl breaks up with guy and they're
like, I'll do anything. I'll do anything.

2130
02:01:57,081 --> 02:01:58,790
Cause at that point you got,
you'll do anything.

2131
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:02,930
How about giving your fucking
password, your Facebook,
your Twitter, all that shit.

2132
02:02:02,990 --> 02:02:06,320
Let me check out them direct messages.
That's probably what it is.

2133
02:02:06,820 --> 02:02:09,890
I called Opie opie and Anthony is chicken.
Answer the phone.

2134
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:14,720
A whole call the cell phone.
Who is assistant? Hey,

2135
02:02:14,721 --> 02:02:16,400
maybe told her. Answer it. You know,

2136
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:19,070
especially if you don't know who the
fuck it is. You know, you see some,

2137
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:21,950
you know phone number and you're not
even sure who the hell it is. Maybe.

2138
02:02:22,070 --> 02:02:25,580
Maybe he didn't give you the whole phone.
Maybe that was a whole phone.

2139
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:29,570
Maybe that's why she was saying maybe
that was a ho or maybe that wasn't the

2140
02:02:29,571 --> 02:02:33,650
whole phone because you're not a Ho and
so he doesn't care who answers the real

2141
02:02:33,651 --> 02:02:38,360
phone, you know? Oh I see. I
don't think he rocks it like
that. He just had a kid to

2142
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:42,590
Eddie Bravo.
Someday you're going to have kids.

2143
02:02:43,130 --> 02:02:46,310
What are you thinking about that you
feel extra pressure even thinking about

2144
02:02:46,311 --> 02:02:48,080
that, considering how fucked
up your childhood was?

2145
02:02:49,370 --> 02:02:52,790
I did growing up,
I really thought that hey,

2146
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:56,060
there might be a chance that I don't
give a fuck about my kids because my dad

2147
02:02:56,061 --> 02:02:58,520
didn't get by me. I mean
I'm the, I was like scared.

2148
02:02:58,550 --> 02:03:03,470
Like that would kill me if
my father thought or if my
child thought of me like I

2149
02:03:03,471 --> 02:03:05,750
thought of it. Think of my father
that would fucking destroy me.

2150
02:03:05,751 --> 02:03:10,130
Saw that I was scared of having kids
most of my life, but I almost had a kid.

2151
02:03:10,190 --> 02:03:12,470
I thought I had a kid then,
you know, we had the DNA test,

2152
02:03:12,471 --> 02:03:14,150
but I had a kid for three months.

2153
02:03:14,151 --> 02:03:17,720
I played the daddy and that's when
I knew I could, I could, I could,

2154
02:03:17,810 --> 02:03:19,910
I would love my kid no matter what.
That was a test.

2155
02:03:19,911 --> 02:03:21,260
I thought I had a kid for three months.

2156
02:03:22,030 --> 02:03:24,190
What was it like when you walked away?
After three months?

2157
02:03:24,770 --> 02:03:25,461
I didn't walk away.

2158
02:03:25,461 --> 02:03:27,890
After three months I stayed after
we found out it wasn't mine.

2159
02:03:27,891 --> 02:03:32,570
I stayed and I hung in there as long
as possible, but the chick was just so,

2160
02:03:32,571 --> 02:03:33,500
uh,
um,

2161
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:37,110
uh, she just, it just

2162
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:40,870
do not fucking work, man.
You know how that goes. Yeah.
And I had to make a choice.

2163
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:44,980
You know what the craziest thing is
when we finally did break up, I'd come,

2164
02:03:45,010 --> 02:03:50,010
I came back like a maybe two
months later to see Jake and he,

2165
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:54,100
he still remembered me is to remember,
but it was kind of like,

2166
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:55,330
fuck where you been for two months.

2167
02:03:55,690 --> 02:03:59,650
And then I came back like six months
later and when I came back and he really

2168
02:03:59,651 --> 02:04:03,500
did recognize me, like the girl had a
pullout, like pictures of us at the zoo.

2169
02:04:03,501 --> 02:04:05,830
Remember? He's the one who took you
to the zoo, remember? And he's like,

2170
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:13,060
Dallas, like a fuck. You
don't even know me. God Damn,

2171
02:04:13,090 --> 02:04:15,100
those motherfuckers won't forget you

2172
02:04:15,430 --> 02:04:17,140
if you're not around for like six months.

2173
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:22,960
Has the mood. Yeah. Then
I realized, you know,

2174
02:04:23,110 --> 02:04:25,240
once he started forgetting me,
then I realized, you know what?

2175
02:04:25,241 --> 02:04:27,880
I could just step away from this.
Now. It'd be a good idea just to,

2176
02:04:27,970 --> 02:04:29,050
just to get out of this.

2177
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:33,000
He doesn't remember miss six months
off from seeing a baby. Yeah.

2178
02:04:34,370 --> 02:04:38,340
Yeah man. He was like, it
was like this happened when
was like one, one and a half,

2179
02:04:38,341 --> 02:04:40,560
something like that is walking around,
you know?

2180
02:04:40,561 --> 02:04:42,030
And then he just started
forgetting about me.

2181
02:04:42,031 --> 02:04:44,880
There was a trip and
then I just backed out.

2182
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:50,970
How many times have you thought a
chick was pregnant and wasn't? Dude,

2183
02:04:50,971 --> 02:04:52,200
I didn't want to talk about that.

2184
02:04:53,930 --> 02:04:58,890
How much does not even talk about
crazy shit like that man. Ugly.

2185
02:04:59,050 --> 02:05:02,040
Yeah. We should also say we're going
to be on another podcast. Oh yeah,

2186
02:05:02,041 --> 02:05:04,650
we're going to do Doug Benson as
podcasts and were like two hours.

2187
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:06,600
We got a dirt through traffic and,

2188
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:08,930
well it's five now.
We're all right.

2189
02:05:09,650 --> 02:05:13,820
And we got to hit down to the UCB to do
the Doug Benson podcasts tonight. Crazy.

2190
02:05:13,970 --> 02:05:17,810
We hung out with Doug when we were in
Vegas. He was there for some poker.

2191
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:20,990
And so what he came to show it the house
of Blues and we hung out and then we,

2192
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:22,910
he came to the UFC the next day too.

2193
02:05:22,940 --> 02:05:26,180
He's a good motherfucker and he's the
reason why I had to make a fan line cause

2194
02:05:26,181 --> 02:05:29,900
I fucked up and twittered my
number, my number, I thought to him,

2195
02:05:29,990 --> 02:05:33,200
I thought it was twittering it direct
message. Right. It was a repliers.

2196
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:36,230
I've twittered just a straight
message to the whole fucking world.

2197
02:05:36,260 --> 02:05:37,190
So I had to get a new phone.

2198
02:05:38,590 --> 02:05:40,000
But you gotta do son.

2199
02:05:40,090 --> 02:05:42,880
But so we're going to go do the Doug
Benson podcasts right after this.

2200
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:46,840
Anything else we should talk about before
we wrap this pitch up? Any problem?

2201
02:05:46,870 --> 02:05:51,080
I'm good. Join all of our twitters,
which are low listed below Eddie Bravo.

2202
02:05:51,081 --> 02:05:53,120
It red band Joe Rogan.
No, I don't. They know.

2203
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:57,190
I don't want anybody to jump on my
Twitter. My Shit. I just post disgusting,

2204
02:05:57,191 --> 02:06:00,490
crazy weird ass shit. You do
not want to see my shit. It's,

2205
02:06:00,491 --> 02:06:04,870
it's definitely already psychology. Plus
you want to keep it, you want to keep it.

2206
02:06:05,710 --> 02:06:09,010
That's how I look at it. I like, I
want to, a VIP could easily offended,

2207
02:06:09,011 --> 02:06:10,450
do not follow me,
please.

2208
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,590
Well, no one who's listening to this show
is easily offended unless you're just

2209
02:06:13,591 --> 02:06:17,670
looking for ammunition. That mother
Fucker, what'd he say about Jesus?

2210
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:20,430
There's a lot of people out
there doing that. I'm sure

2211
02:06:20,620 --> 02:06:23,660
we should also say that
you have a new Q and a, uh,

2212
02:06:24,280 --> 02:06:27,640
oh yeah. You know, I haven't
really set that up totally.
I mean, I signed up for it,

2213
02:06:27,641 --> 02:06:28,990
but I don't know how to do it in the,

2214
02:06:28,991 --> 02:06:31,900
in the future we'll have
like a Q and a podcasts.

2215
02:06:32,110 --> 02:06:35,650
I should do them by myself or I just read
off the questions and just answer them

2216
02:06:35,710 --> 02:06:36,940
and just do it to camera.

2217
02:06:37,060 --> 02:06:39,700
So I'll do one of those in the future
because I get so many of the same

2218
02:06:39,701 --> 02:06:40,900
questions over and over again.

2219
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:45,160
It would be better if I could figure out
a way to answer him just to, you know.

2220
02:06:45,910 --> 02:06:50,680
But if you want to find out info on

Yeah, we are sponsored by
fleshlight.com and uh, like I said,

2226
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:13,810
even if I wasn't sponsored by it,
I probably wouldn't talk about it as much,

2227
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:16,390
but it's still telling you you should
go fuck one of those things cause it's

2228
02:07:16,391 --> 02:07:19,450
awesome. I think different sizes. I
don't know they have a mouth though.

2229
02:07:19,451 --> 02:07:22,020
I saw a mouth online.
The things really

2230
02:07:22,130 --> 02:07:25,090
and twilight, when did they have a
twilight one can fly. It's got banks.

2231
02:07:25,100 --> 02:07:28,460
It's a vampire one night. Twilight
one now. Fucking vampire cock sucker.

2232
02:07:28,490 --> 02:07:30,950
Let me tell you something. When I
was young, the bottom Ms. Collins.

2233
02:07:30,951 --> 02:07:35,740
That's a fucking vampire. Okay. He
walks in the room. Ladies and gentlemen,

2234
02:07:35,741 --> 02:07:36,160
you guys

2235
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:38,380
have been a of,
I don't know what you've been,

2236
02:07:38,381 --> 02:07:41,210
you might be fucking screaming upset
at. He's at me right now. Who Know?

2237
02:07:41,230 --> 02:07:45,150
Fuck knows what you are. You know, I can't
say you've been anything. You guys, uh,

2238
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:49,480
you're just out there, but we
appreciate you. You might be cool.

2239
02:07:50,050 --> 02:07:52,930
Hopefully you are. Hopefully you've
been great. As you're watching,

2240
02:07:52,931 --> 02:07:56,620
you haven't been yelling. You forget
to talk about some other shit, but, uh,

2241
02:07:56,621 --> 02:08:01,240
we appreciate the fuck out of it as always
on our podcast by lays also. Now on,

2242
02:08:01,250 --> 02:08:06,190
I caught again a stitcher. Oh yeah,
it's on stitcher. So what stitcher is,

2243
02:08:06,191 --> 02:08:09,670
is a, um, if you go to Joe
rogan.net, um, the front page,

2244
02:08:09,671 --> 02:08:11,080
there's a link and if
you click on the link,

2245
02:08:11,081 --> 02:08:15,490
it'll take you to the stitcher website
that's set up just for my podcast and it

2246
02:08:15,491 --> 02:08:18,640
gives you the information exactly how
to do it, but it's real, super simple.

2247
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:20,500
You load it up on your phone pretty much.

2248
02:08:20,501 --> 02:08:23,230
Now you could stream
over your cell phones,

2249
02:08:23,231 --> 02:08:27,430
you can stream our podcasts and
it's, it's, we're also on iTunes.

2250
02:08:27,431 --> 02:08:28,830
But this is just another
thing you can not,

2251
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:32,290
it's for people who are not
into apple and you know,

2252
02:08:32,291 --> 02:08:33,880
they want to be able to
do it on their smartphone,

2253
02:08:34,030 --> 02:08:38,290
but we're also going to be
switching over. So we, we have a,

2254
02:08:38,291 --> 02:08:42,220
a Zune one and, uh, we'll have an
iPhone app one, two, that'll all be,

2255
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:46,330
that's all in the works. So, uh,
thank you very much for tuning in,

2256
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:49,270
and we will see you bitches next week.

2257
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:54,010
And I say bitches with all the love
in the world as Salaam Alaikum.
