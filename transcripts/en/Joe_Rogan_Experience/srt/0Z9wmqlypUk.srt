1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,950
Is it recording?
Yes.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:06,920
Good.
Okay.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,210
Beautiful.
Yeah,

4
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:10,810
we always have these things where it's 
three hours.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,410
I'm like,
God,

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,100
it,
we can,

7
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:14,420
uh,
you know,

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,820
at least you don't have a 30 or 60 
minutes show.

9
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:19,340
They have to put your commercials in the
middle and everything.

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,660
By the way,
I'll give a plug for legal zoom that 

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,610
when I first came to California it took 
me two days in a law library to get up 

12
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,000
to speed so I could write my will and 
uh,

13
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,390
I was glad to see that there's still a 
discount with Rogan cause that's my 

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,100
project this month is to Redo my will 
and leave,

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,730
you know,
I've,

16
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,690
I've known about legal zoom for a long 
time and is a really good group.

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,720
That's another thing that I think the 
internet sort of made a lot easier 

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,860
finding out what your rights are,
finding out how the law of lawyers 

19
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,770
mainly know how to use the library and 
have their secretaries type of things,

20
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:54,050
you know,
because they gotta go by so and so legal

21
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:57,120
zoom can take care of probably 95 
percent of all your stuff.

22
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,930
Did you go from being a lawyer to 
running a computer company?

23
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,850
Well,
I was,

24
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:05,500
uh,
I was practicing law in Houston and uh,

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,890
we had primarily a business law.
Uh,

26
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:10,670
my partner and I owned a title insurance
company and we're doing,

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,630
it was in the heyday in Houston when the
savings and loan thing was going on,

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,760
but,
uh,

29
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,070
one day our main client came in and he 
had a big construction company and he 

30
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,970
wanted to sue one of his subcontractors 
and,

31
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,430
you know,
I looked at all and I said,

32
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:25,190
well,
Jeremy,

33
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:30,191
I know you,
you can file a lawsuit but you're not 

34
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:30,191
going to win because he's in the right 
here.

35
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:30,191
He says,
oh,

36
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,490
I know that.
I just want to hurt him.

37
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,250
So I said,
give me just a minute.

38
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,290
I walked around to the next office,
to my partner.

39
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,330
I said,
figure out what my share of the south is

40
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:38,570
worth.

41
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,680
I quit,
I'm going home.

42
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,960
And that was when I,
I just,

43
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:46,230
I,
it'd been building up to that because 

44
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,131
I've been doing stuff that I didn't 
become a lawyer to hurt people and do 

45
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:48,131
stuff like that.
And so,

46
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:49,810
uh,
I just walked away from it and uh,

47
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,630
had gotten locked involved in multilevel
marketing.

48
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,220
Wow.
And uh,

49
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,080
yeah,
uh,

50
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,400
what I found out is,
is that if you say,

51
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:59,900
Hey,
I'm a lawyer and I'm doing this,

52
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,370
people just flock to you,
you know,

53
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,510
I have lots of people.
And because you're a lawyer doing well,

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:04,950
they say,
well,

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,200
if a lawyer is doing it,
you know,

56
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,870
it's got to be great.
So is it like a pyramid scheme?

57
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,800
Pyramid come.
Yeah,

58
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,980
we're selling a do it yourself at home 
facelifts.

59
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,010
It was,
it was before anybody knew about aloe.

60
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:21,200
Vera was one of the first aloe companies
and it was really easy to sell.

61
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:25,070
We do a meeting and a bunch of people to
be there and you'd paint half their face

62
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:28,070
with this stuff and leave it on for like
30 minutes and take it off.

63
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,070
And it looked like there to patient one 
side's a little higher.

64
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:36,071
And yet sort of like putting a,
what's that hemorrhoid medicine in your 

65
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:39,030
face or something.
But what's hemorrhoid preparation?

66
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,880
Preparation H,
yeah,

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,630
it happens when you put.
It just tightens you up.

68
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,300
It tightens your skin up for an hour or 
so.

69
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:46,960
When you put aloe Vera,
this was a whole bunch of it.

70
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,970
It actually did work.
It did tighten up your skin and get rid 

71
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:51,970
of some wrinkles for the evening.
Yeah.

72
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,400
Oh yeah.
It worked for the evening.

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,140
For the evening.
Yeah.

74
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:54,800
It wasn't pretty.
But uh,

75
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:56,450
and,
and we sold a whole variety of things.

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,670
Why don't like actors do that before 
they make movies,

77
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,320
I think get this stuff and you can't get
a hold of era anymore.

78
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:02,380
You can get elevated.
But this was,

79
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,350
this had some powders and stuff.
You use a chemical thing.

80
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,280
What happened to the surface now people 
say no,

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
the company went out of business.
Uh,

82
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,120
you know,
there,

83
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:12,750
there's all these,
you know,

84
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,760
I,
I know a lot about these multilevel 

85
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:17,760
companies.
They,

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,140
they all spring from a vitamin company,
a neutral light,

87
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,030
I think it's called.
And that's where the,

88
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:27,031
uh,
device and Van Andel it started a amway 

89
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:27,031
came true light.
Yeah.

90
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:29,710
I think amway finally bought them or 
something like that.

91
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,220
But what's that big one?
That's a big one with the leaves that.

92
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,610
Oh,
that's a uh,

93
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,050
I'll think of it in huge company.

94
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,660
Yeah.
Well,

95
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,390
anyhow,
herbalife,

96
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,800
herbalife,
in fact,

97
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:44,770
one of the first vice president came out
of this company.

98
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:49,771
I was in a ideal incorporated,
but there was a dare to be great and 

99
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,100
cause caught.
And uh,

100
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,970
one that,
uh,

101
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:54,670
the California governor campaign,
that guy.

102
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,740
Anyhow,
I used to know a whole lot about this 

103
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,070
and they all sprung from the same core 
of people at one time.

104
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:05,071
They all knew each other and I got 
involved in that for awhile and we were 

105
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:08,280
selling all kinds of thing.
And then my partner and I started a 

106
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,100
jewelry company and we kind of fell out 
and I was into computers.

107
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:12,790
So I started a computer company.
It was a pyramid company and uh,

108
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:13,930
you know,
it,

109
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,250
it was a lot of fun.
But,

110
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:16,260
uh,
you know,

111
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,570
I finally lost the faith because for 
awhile I really believed that you could 

112
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,210
do these things.

113
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:22,690
You know,
we had a,

114
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,190
a woman who was a German refugee that 
wound up making $20,000

115
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:30,010
a month and stuff like that.
And so those things did happen,

116
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:31,570
but they were so rare.
Finally,

117
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,890
uh,
you know,

118
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:35,800
I was able to see the light.
Well,

119
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:40,801
it happened after I started taking Mtma.
That's when I got out of the 

120
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,550
motivational business and everything.
And the motivational business,

121
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,000
that's a slippery business.
It's fascinating to me.

122
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:51,001
People that have never been successful 
at business but give motivational 

123
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,000
seminars on how to be successful at 
business.

124
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,370
After my computer company crashed.
That's what I got into.

125
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,680
That's a fascinating thing,
isn't it?

126
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,540
That people would.
It's sort of like,

127
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:03,541
you know,
like there's comedy classes that are 

128
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,181
taught by extremely unfunny people.
I believe people that have never had a 

129
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,661
career as a comedian,
but they decided to start teaching 

130
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:11,080
comedy and then they started making more
money teaching comedy than they ever did

131
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,280
doing comedy itself.

132
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,810
Yeah.
It's like a lot of that.

133
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,840
Back in Boston,
there was a guy that was terrible 

134
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:18,840
comedian who was teaching the local 
comedy class.

135
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,170
I was like,
that doesn't make any.

136
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:21,730
Like,
what the fuck was going on here?

137
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,340
You couldn't get a real comedian to 
teach a comedy class.

138
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:29,341
They didn't want to have any part of it 
and you'd be surprised how many 

139
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:29,740
motivational speakers are great 
depression all the time.

140
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:30,200
You know,
we'd,

141
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,440
we'd go back after the thing would be 
over.

142
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:33,860
We'd get off stage,
Oh gee,

143
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,630
my wife is leaving me and you know,
all these.

144
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,320
We had more problems than our audience 
combined probably.

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,200
But you had some good ideas.
He just had to figure it out.

146
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:44,630
Yeah.
You know,

147
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,690
they were all,
you know,

148
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,030
from 100 years ago,
you know,

149
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,020
there's not much new in that field.
It's a.

150
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,900
well,
Anthony Robbins is another one.

151
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,950
Right.
Tony Robbins,

152
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,740
he's a super successful at that.
But what else has he done?

153
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,470
I mean,
is he like,

154
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:59,590
had like a successful real business.
You know,

155
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,600
when he first came in the scene,
I just started kicking myself because I 

156
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:04,600
said,
gosh,

157
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,300
I was doing that and I'm better than 
him.

158
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,360
He's very handsome or beautiful teeth.
Oh yeah.

159
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,490
He's in,
he's got.

160
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,180
He has a lot more confident than I was a
booming voice.

161
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,040
Throws karate kicks,
but you know,

162
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:21,041
eventually you kind of push yourself to.
Then he started doing all the 

163
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:21,960
firewalking and stuff like that and 
yeah,

164
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,180
that's firewalk hey,
my wife did it and did not get burned 

165
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,030
the first time you could do it and knock
it burn to.

166
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,500
Oh well no.
You Walk Quick.

167
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:34,400
I could not do it.
I'm not going to walk on fire barefoot,

168
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,150
but if you did,
you'd be all right.

169
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,520
The whole idea is getting through 
quickly.

170
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,240
If I did,
I know I'd get through all right because

171
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:42,830
I wouldn't do it unless I was sure I was
going to get through.

172
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:44,390
All right.
Um,

173
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,000
you could think that you are going to be
all right and not be all right.

174
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,830
But that's what happened the second 
time.

175
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,440
How far did she walk longer?
The second time I think was probably the

176
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:55,340
same.
Real?

177
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:56,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

178
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,390
I don't know.
I mean I didn't know her then.

179
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,660
I probably shouldn't be talking about 
it.

180
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,720
I get it symbolically.
You.

181
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,680
No,
but unless it's fuckery.

182
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,980
Like we all know fire burns are wise 
finding out brand because I don't 

183
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:08,980
believe it's going to burn.
Oh boy.

184
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,750
I'm not sure about that.
I think you might be playing games here.

185
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,170
Oh,
you know,

186
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:14,480
the three laws of taking psychedelics 
are,

187
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,550
number one,
cars are real.

188
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,470
Number two,
fire burns,

189
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,840
and number three,
gravity is still a law.

190
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,420
If you lift as those three things,
you can't go wrong.

191
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,750
That's like the bill Hicks joke.
Did you ever the bill Hicks choke on 

192
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:28,750
acid?
Thought he could fly,

193
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,080
jumped off the building,
and he's like,

194
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,420
if he thought he could fly,
what did he take off from the ground?

195
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,980
I didn't hear the last a moron.
I remember that.

196
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:38,270
That's.
It's so logical.

197
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,770
It is logical.
It's like,

198
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:41,180
wait a minute.
That guy was an asshole.

199
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,400
He was a Houston Guy,
right?

200
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,280
Yeah.
See I,

201
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,300
I left Houston by then when I was going 
to law school in Houston.

202
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Uh,
the only celebrity I saw that wasn't a 

203
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,800
celebrity then was Glen Campbell was,
was singing for tips in this bar.

204
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,660
I used to.
But uh,

205
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,940
I,
I used to hang out and lightning hopkins

206
00:07:58,941 --> 00:07:59,930
bar.
He was a black,

207
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:03,650
a blues guy and uh,
a couple of us would go down to Houston.

208
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

209
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,980
He was that down in the fifth ward 
somewhere,

210
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,140
we'd have to go into a little group,
but we went regularly enough that we got

211
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:13,940
known were the only white kids in there,
you know,

212
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:15,370
and so,
uh,

213
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
one and he'd,
you know,

214
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,580
he'd wrapped with us and stuff and I 
said,

215
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:20,870
hey,
I can play the spoons.

216
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,700
And he says,
give the boys some spoons,

217
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:27,701
get up here.
And so I started playing the spoons 

218
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:27,701
while he's playing guitar,
you know,

219
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:30,290
and he stops and he says,
you're in law school right now?

220
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,800
I said,
yeah.

221
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,480
He says,
go back to law school.

222
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,240
You'll never make it as a musician.
What an asshole.

223
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:35,670
Oh No,
no.

224
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,910
He did it in a funny way and I know he 
was,

225
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,880
he was actually right.
I couldn't keep a beat.

226
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:45,881
You know,
Houston had two of the greatest 

227
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:46,750
comedians of all time come out of it.
Sam kinison and building it in.

228
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,710
Yeah,
that's right.

229
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,780
They had that whole Houston annex down 
back and then they had like a real 

230
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,230
creative group of young up and coming 
comedians and they,

231
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,920
you know,
they started this thing that

232
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,130
Houston comedy outlaws.
And it was Hicks and Kennison and a 

233
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,000
bunch of other guys.
Fascinating sort of a development.

234
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,350
I went to law school there in Houston 
and I taught sailing at Houston Yacht 

235
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,750
Club.
That's how I got there because of 

236
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,100
Kennison.
They all had like this unique style 

237
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,840
that's very aggressive in your face.
Thoughtful style of,

238
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,690
of breaking things down in a very 
logical way,

239
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:19,860
you know,
but,

240
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,200
but making good points,
but also,

241
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,660
you know,
being like really bold about it.

242
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,090
I heard you and,
and uh,

243
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,970
I think it was mark Marin talking about 
Kennison and boy,

244
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,510
that really gave me a whole new,
uh,

245
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,540
Marin sm,
amazing Kennis and stories.

246
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:38,541
When he was on his podcast,
he was talking about doing coke with 

247
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,481
Kennison and you know,
how he was hearing voices for like a 

248
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,090
year.
They did someone who was a young kid.

249
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:43,440
Then when you're with him,
you know,

250
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,990
but she,
can you imagine he did so much coke.

251
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,520
He was hearing voices for a year.
Whoa man.

252
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:52,620
Holy break.
Your Brain Batman.

253
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,500
I was lucky I never cook.
I was like,

254
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,540
you've never tried it.
I,

255
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,240
I,
I,

256
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,360
the same woman that gave me Mtma for the
first time.

257
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:03,210
I gave me my first line of coke and I 
said,

258
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,860
oh,
this is awful man.

259
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:06,780
It's like being a dentist's office.
And she said,

260
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,460
Oh yeah,
it's always like that and beginning,

261
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:09,390
but you know,
after,

262
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,530
after you know,
10,

263
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:11,240
12 times,
she'll,

264
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,270
you'll get to like it.
And I said,

265
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:15,540
you know,
I went through that with Scotch and it's

266
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,600
cheap and legal.
I'm not going to go through that again.

267
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,490
Yeah,
there's weird things like caviar,

268
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,740
it's an acquired taste.
Why would you acquire it?

269
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,010
Why would you acquire something that 
costs $10,000

270
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:26,820
in,
tastes like shit.

271
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,810
And if you don't like it to begin with,
why acquire it?

272
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,940
Why acquire that?
That seems really silly.

273
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,190
Yeah.
I never did the cocaine,

274
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:40,191
but uh,
I've had a bunch of people near me that 

275
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:41,010
had problems with it.
I always associate cocaine with a lot of

276
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:44,160
negative things that I'd seen,
but one of the biggest ones was,

277
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:46,860
uh,
I was driving with some friends.

278
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,070
We were in revere Massachusetts and 
there was this two lane road that we're 

279
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,630
leaving this area that was like a,
there was this famous place.

280
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,140
We'd go to Kelly's roast beef and 
everybody would go there and get clams.

281
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,600
They had like fried clams there.
It's like a famous spot.

282
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,120
People travel from far and wide to go to
Kelly's.

283
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,290
So we were driving back from that and 
there's people behind us,

284
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,710
people beside us in this car,
we're doing coke and there was a girl in

285
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:14,520
the backseat and they had the light that
dome light on and she was doing coke and

286
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:16,590
she looks over and sees us looking in 
there and she goes like this,

287
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,470
fuck.

288
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,930
She's like,
as they're driving by just looks at me 

289
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,440
like anger and craziness and that's how 
I view coke.

290
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,740
Have you is like that lady.
Look,

291
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,290
I was looking at her.
You're doing coke.

292
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,760
You have the Dome light on and I'm 
looking at you and you're mad at me.

293
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,490
I didn't do anything.
No.

294
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,390
I've had a few friends that got into it 
too far and it's.

295
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,970
It's devastating.
Yeah.

296
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:44,270
So another thing that's another one of 
those things that your body connects to 

297
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,320
chemicals and become,
it becomes a massive part of your life 

298
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,830
or some really strange reason.
I've only done meth twice.

299
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,420
Oh,
that's a weird thing to say.

300
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,290
And,
and

301
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,330
the reason I would never do it again is 
because it's the one drug that could hit

302
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,970
hook me is wow.
The first time I did,

303
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:05,971
I didn't even know what it was.
I was a crewing for racing sailboats 

304
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:09,541
over New Orleans at Mardi gras regatta.
And a guy that owned the boat was from 

305
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,610
Houston and I was in law school there 
and he wanted me to drive his boat back.

306
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,910
Trail is on a trailer that dragon.
And I said,

307
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,960
oh,
I can't go back.

308
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,190
You know,
I'm sleepy,

309
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:19,540
I haven't slept in two days.
And he says,

310
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,410
here,
take this.

311
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,370
He gave me this and I drove straight 
through from New Orleans to Houston.

312
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,870
I was wired,
you know,

313
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,110
and it was about a year later I said,
hey,

314
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:31,480
I want one more of those things.
And he gave it to me and I thought,

315
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,660
you know,
I could get really hooked on this stuff,

316
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:36,940
but I never drive her mess.
What truck?

317
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:37,960
Driver math?
Yeah.

318
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,090
That's the real math,
right?

319
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,220
I don't know,
but I never came near it again after 

320
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,220
that.
I've had some people got in real trouble

321
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,360
with that to some friends.
What is the comedown light?

322
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,490
It's,
it's crash.

323
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,260
For me,
it was just a total crash.

324
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:51,880
I could,
once I finally came down,

325
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,070
I didn't go to class for a couple of 
days.

326
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:54,280
You know,

327
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,560
when you were taking pure Mtma you had 
no crash at all?

328
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,320
I didn't not,
you know,

329
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,390
because nobody knew that you're supposed
to.

330
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,630
I think that uh,
the other thing is I was working at the 

331
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:06,630
time,
so maybe I was just so busy.

332
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,670
I didn't notice it.
But,

333
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:09,340
uh,
I'd never had to come down crash.

334
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:10,090
When I was in Dallas,

335
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,900
I had a big one.
I'll read it once.

336
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,910
The next day I had to perform,
I had to do a standup set and I went to 

337
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,990
a coffee shop in the morning and I was 
reading a magazine I couldn't read.

338
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,370
I was like,
I couldn't read.

339
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:23,640
I couldn't,
couldn't stay focused long enough to get

340
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:25,800
through a sentence.
I couldn't get through a paragraph.

341
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:26,660
I couldn't do it.
I just,

342
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,780
I did have it in there.
I was like,

343
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:29,490
wow,
I am stupid as fuck.

344
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,560
I was like,
what's going on with my brain?

345
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:36,830
I didn't know about five htp.
I didn't know about supplementing 

346
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,771
afterwards to try to re re re kickstart 
your brain's ability to produce 

347
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:41,790
serotonin and dopamine.
But uh,

348
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,390
it didn't,
didn't sit me while I enjoyed the 

349
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:47,390
experience as far as like what I got out
of it.

350
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,350
But I also thought this would be very 
dangerous because that reality of the 

351
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:56,450
loving,
warm ecstasy feeling when you're locked 

352
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,050
into it is very appealing.
And you could want to do that a lot.

353
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,380
And then if you wanted to do that a lot,
you would experience that more or enjoy 

354
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,190
it more than you would enjoy regular 
reality.

355
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:06,100
And then it would,
you know,

356
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,160
it's sort of like a point of diminishing
returns,

357
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,780
build up a tolerance to it.
Yeah.

358
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:15,781
I,
I did more Mtma then is sensible and 

359
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,630
because I didn't know what I was doing,
see,

360
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,310
that was the problem back then.
Nobody knew anything about it in Dallas,

361
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,170
you know,
and we know it's safe,

362
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:25,720
don't worry about it.
And there was just no literature.

363
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:27,670
There was no nothing.
How did it get started?

364
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,140
Uh,
well,

365
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,820
the,
I don't know if the story ever really 

366
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:34,820
got out,
but this guy,

367
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,140
what he went by,
the name Thomas Crown,

368
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,490
he was the,
uh,

369
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,640
he was really the mainstay.
Although,

370
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:39,360
uh,
uh,

371
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,220
there's a guy that,
uh,

372
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,320
I'll think of his name in a minute.
Everybody thought was the number one guy

373
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:49,321
in Dallas,
but he was a good friend of Tim leary 

374
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:49,321
and he's out here in La and Tim leary 
says here,

375
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,860
try this.
And that's when he found him.

376
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,890
Oh,
this is great.

377
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,590
I'm going to take it back.
And He,

378
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,590
he lit up Dallas with this stuff.
So,

379
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:56,510
uh,
but,

380
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,230
uh,
I,

381
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,290
I actually did a motivational speech and
Mtma one time about two hours after I'd 

382
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,001
taken it,
so I was still pretty much up there and 

383
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:09,260
they'd pay me to do a 30 minute keynote 
speech at this big corporate thing.

384
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,070
I was an hour into it when they finally 
caught me off the stage,

385
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,790
I had people on their feet is one of the
best talks I ever gave.

386
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,050
Why they,
they cut you off,

387
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,750
but it was only supposed to talk 30 
minutes and after an hour they said,

388
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,830
you know,
that's really enough.

389
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,660
Wow.
That's A.

390
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,250
Nobody was only one person in the room 
that knew I was an Mtma.

391
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,010
It was one of the women there that uh,
uh,

392
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,690
actually she was one of my distributors.
And what did she think?

393
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:38,090
She,
she couldn't believe I was going to go 

394
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,090
on first of all.
Wow.

395
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,890
I did a lot of stupid stuff.
Yeah.

396
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:44,891
Well that sounds like nobody really knew
what the hell was going on with that 

397
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:44,891
stuff.
Chances.

398
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:45,540
Human Guinea pigs.
Yeah.

399
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,690
And in that little interview I did,
I told about the time that uh,

400
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,740
well I took an way excessive dose.
What does that mean?

401
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,280
What's the way?
Excessive 1500 milligrams.

402
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,850
What's the,
what's an average one?

403
00:15:56,851 --> 00:15:59,600
Hundred and 20 is what is that what you 
should take?

404
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,820
You shouldn't,
you should 120.

405
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:06,821
So you took 10 times and I still have 
these two cassette to 90 minute cassette

406
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,830
tapes that I filled up talking that 
whole time.

407
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,590
I've never had the courage to listen to 
them again.

408
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,860
But from that time,
for another seven years,

409
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:19,790
I'd tried Mtma about five years ago.
Not long after nothing happened.

410
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,470
Five years after.
Nothing happened.

411
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,310
About seven years after I finally got 
MDM aid work again,

412
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:26,840
only did it once,
a year after that.

413
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,820
And I haven't done it now and I guess 
five,

414
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,630
six,
seven years.

415
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:30,530
But,
uh,

416
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,360
it,
it really fried my brain.

417
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:33,590
Now,
you know,

418
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:37,730
Oprah put this bad news information out 
about the holes in the brain thing.

419
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,940
And the night before,
a couple days for that show aired,

420
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:45,290
her producer was informed by maps that 
this is a totally bogus.

421
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,640
It was alive.
They put out there,

422
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,850
there's no holes in the brain.
It was a blood flow Mri or something 

423
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,270
like that.
And I,

424
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:58,271
you know,
maybe I would be a genius today if I 

425
00:16:58,271 --> 00:16:58,271
hadn't done that,
but it,

426
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:01,160
you know,
it didn't really fry my brain now.

427
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:06,161
It was so stupid.
I had a monster headache for three or 

428
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:09,830
four days and a did not work again for a
long,

429
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:12,620
long time,
but it didn't kill me and it didn't,

430
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,300
I don't think put holes in my brain.

431
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,090
The holes in the brain things,
what everybody said.

432
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:18,470
That was one of those,
well Oprah,

433
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,490
Oprah did that,
you know,

434
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:24,491
she had this Mri at this woman and the 
woman knew that it wasn't a hole in her 

435
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:28,451
brain maps.
So I got ahold of it and they really 

436
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:29,470
gave her all the information.
What this is,

437
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:31,850
is about blood flow or something.
Uh,

438
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,910
but it was not a hole in her brain.
And Oprah's producer knew that going in 

439
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,261
and she still let that hit the air.
Sort of like the Ben Gazi thing only 

440
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:41,300
didn't get busted.
That's so silly.

441
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,760
Why?
You know,

442
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,970
why,
why,

443
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,480
why,
but you know,

444
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,390
I think they probably were trying to 
save people.

445
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:52,391
They're probably trying to like scare 
people off doing and maybe in this day 

446
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:53,740
and age when you're dealing with 
something that's ultimately,

447
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,500
you know,
cut with a bunch of other shit.

448
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,150
Now I went up,
I would never take something that,

449
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:03,290
that I got at a rave or a party or 
something like that that you just can't 

450
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:03,290
trust this stuff.

451
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:03,780
And a lot of it's,
you know,

452
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,050
you don't know who's making it.
And we at least had good sources,

453
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,940
good supplies.
We knew who the chemist was,

454
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,710
stuff like that.
But uh,

455
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,240
today it's really not safe unless you're
the chemist or friend of,

456
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:15,840
um,
unfortunately,

457
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,040
you know,
all,

458
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,340
all could be fixed in a way you don't 
need to.

459
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:24,210
You've got pot.
Cannabis is really the miracle drug.

460
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:24,640
It,
you know,

461
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,140
the plant does so much things for you.
The hemp plant does that.

462
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,430
Cannabis is really a medicinal plant.
Certainly is.

463
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,810
But for ptsd there's nothing like MDM,
mdm a,

464
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,220
but see that would be used with a doctor
who knows his fly and stuff like that.

465
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,060
Now I'm not saying there's anything 
wrong with dancing.

466
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:43,950
I've danced all night on it too.
It's really good,

467
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:44,850
but there you.
Oh,

468
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:48,120
that's wonderful.
How old were you when you were dancing?

469
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,040
All night on MDM and I was in my 
sixties.

470
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,230
You were just learning?
Yeah.

471
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,290
I'm.
I'm just catching up.

472
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,570
You know,
your kids got ahead of me.

473
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,350
Everybody.
They're ahead of us.

474
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,640
Data you.
They're ahead of me.

475
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:58,110
The kids of today,
are they?

476
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:00,030
They're starting from the jump of the 
information.

477
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,610
They just need to be cautious.
Don't have to be crazy about these.

478
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,660
It's just so unfortunate.
When we have so many dangerous drugs 

479
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,050
that are labeled their prescription 
drugs,

480
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:10,570
their,
their,

481
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,960
their,
their dosages clearly marked.

482
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,260
We know about them and yet there's these
illegal ones that are just floating 

483
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,980
around out there and they're there in 
commerce or in connection.

484
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:24,981
There's money.
Money's being exchanged back and forth 

485
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:27,120
for taking him.
There's no way you can ever regulate 

486
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,120
that unless you make it illegal.
You can't.

487
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,881
You can't.
It is legal and then you get some kind 

488
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:31,881
of a structure to take care of it,
but then again,

489
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:33,380
the argument is logo that's going to be 
legal,

490
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,690
going to make meth illegal to like start
with cannabis.

491
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

492
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,240
And see what happens.
You know that uh,

493
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,430
Oh,
you down for legal truck or math?

494
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,830
Math was legal.
Well,

495
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,240
yeah,
because you could regulate it.

496
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,820
Yeah.
But still you regulate it and say,

497
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:48,870
you know,
who needs it?

498
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:53,871
Nobody.
But still people would use it like 

499
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:53,880
crazy.
They'd be way fucked up on it.

500
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,650
They will go to the truck stop.
You know,

501
00:19:55,651 --> 00:19:58,350
I really don't ever give much thought to
those kinds of things because,

502
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:03,351
you know,
I'm not an activist and drug policy or 

503
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:03,351
stuff like that.
And so,

504
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:03,351
uh,
uh,

505
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:03,970
you know,
mushrooms you can,

506
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
you can grow at home now there's a new 
method to chrome and hydrogen peroxide 

507
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,000
so you don't have to worry about all 
this,

508
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:14,290
you know,
sanitation stuff and grow mushrooms and 

509
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:14,700
hydrogen peroxide as a bunch of youtube 
videos about it.

510
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:19,701
Been out about two years now.
Thirty five hours every second goes up 

511
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:21,020
there or something like that,
at least.

512
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,250
Right?

513
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,710
Yeah.
That's just amazing.

514
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,860
I'll tell you another thing,
not to try.

515
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,550
Not that it's not dangerous,
but you know,

516
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:33,270
when I first moved to Florida at a 
little after several years after I moved

517
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:34,920
there and I lost all my connections and 
stuff.

518
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:39,921
So the word on the street was that a 
nutmeg was very similar to MDM and a,

519
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,040
and you could take some nutmeg.
So I got one of those little mccormick 

520
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,601
tins of nutmeg and I,
it all and I took me and not the big 

521
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:50,601
tin,
but the,

522
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:51,460
that me and putting them in capsules.
Yeah.

523
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,130
And I took the whole thing at one time.
Oh my God,

524
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:59,050
I got real sweaty,
got a horrible headache.

525
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,090
And today,
uh,

526
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Christmas time I can't get near the 
Eggnog if it's got nutmeg on it because 

527
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll throw up to this day.
To this day,

528
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:08,470
nutmeg will make me sick.

529
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,420
But I have heard of people getting high 
from nutmeg.

530
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:11,890
So what's that?
That's what I heard too.

531
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:12,480
But.
Well,

532
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:18,090
maybe you have to get the big tin,
but the little tune a big tin of nutmeg 

533
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,460
and we'll just get you sick,
but a big team will get you high.

534
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,520
Well,
I don't know.

535
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,080
I would not try it myself because a 
little tin convinced me not to try it.

536
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:31,081
Yeah.
There was some guys in my message board 

537
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:31,081
that we're experimenting with getting 
high on that.

538
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:31,330
I've heard that.
I just don't believe it.

539
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,260
Is that on the airway they have trip 
reports and getting high on nutmeg.

540
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,400
Maybe they do.
I don't know.

541
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:41,401
I,
I know earth and fire are friends of 

542
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:42,961
mine and it's a release or erowid.org.
That's the first place to go if you're 

543
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:43,540
going to do a drug.
Yeah.

544
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,570
Arrow,
widow and spend a lot more time there 

545
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:48,570
than you spend doing the drug.

546
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:48,700
Yeah.
Arrowhead.

547
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:49,330
Nutmeg.
What's.

548
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:51,610
Find out if they have some horrible 
stories about,

549
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,420
about,
um,

550
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,840
basketball sometimes.
Yeah.

551
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,070
When somebody asked me,
well what's this like?

552
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,210
Should I try this?
I said,

553
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:03,420
go to arrowhead and read the bad trip 
reports and if you can't handle a bad 

554
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,950
trip then don't go.
But don't read the good trip reports.

555
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,470
Anybody can handle a good trip.
Yeah,

556
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,080
there is.
Apparently there's a page on Arrow 

557
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,080
would.
It's all about nutmeg.

558
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:18,630
If I love this.
Arrowhead provides information about 

559
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,931
psychoactive drugs to educate,
to reduce harms and to support and much 

560
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:23,930
needed policy change that,
that,

561
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:29,180
uh,
some of their big customers or not 

562
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,180
customers or readers or dea agent,
police agents,

563
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,380
they have a whole separate section for 
law enforcement and for parents and see 

564
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,251
they started out as just a little 
database for their friends and now it's 

565
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:39,460
one of the most visited websites on the,
on the net.

566
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,040
It's a huge.
So what did the ages go there for?

567
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,800
Education is to find out more about,
you know,

568
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,830
the,
the new drug will hit the streets and 

569
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:48,830
that's one of the first places they'll 
go to find out what it's about.

570
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:53,520
That's interesting.
I wonder if that's how they found out 

571
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:53,520
about bath salts.
I Dunno,

572
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,300
you know,
they'd find out about it on the street,

573
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:57,480
but to find out trip reports,
what do you know?

574
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,160
How do we know what these kids are on?
What's it doing to them?

575
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:05,161
And what do we do to,
we take them to hospital or put them in 

576
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:07,651
jail and yeah,
there's gonna come a day when people 

577
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:07,651
look back at this day and age and go,
God,

578
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:10,240
they were so nutty,
like they just made it.

579
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,410
Well we're just going to add oxygen to 
it in front of them,

580
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,250
sell it.
You know,

581
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,380
we take this and this is illegal to get 
you 38 years,

582
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,500
30 years in jail for one ounce.

583
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,770
This however is exactly the same effects
plus this other weird thing that it 

584
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,721
does.
And you can just buy it as bad as 

585
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:27,721
they're gonna go,
wait,

586
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:31,201
why didn't they fix that?
Why did they let that go on for years 

587
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:31,201
and years and years,
right?

588
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:31,210
You know,
it's crazy.

589
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:33,680
People and poly drugging is a real 
problem with holly.

590
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,430
Dragging a bunch of things together.
Candy flipping,

591
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,150
you know,
some of them are,

592
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,210
are safer than others,
but a lot of the poly drugging is going 

593
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,781
on with the prescription drugs now.
That's really fucking well prescription 

594
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:47,470
drugs just with the alcohol.
That's a scary one.

595
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,500
In the original hearing for cannabis,
when they're going to make it illegal in

596
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:56,501
37,
the only medical testimony was from the 

597
00:23:56,501 --> 00:24:00,311
Ama and that was in favor of cannabis 
and they cut the guy off and throw them 

598
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:02,900
out of the hearing.
The only medical,

599
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,920
a testimony in scheduling it or that 
taxing it at the time was in favor.

600
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,240
Yeah,
we're in some weird time still.

601
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,170
It's amazing.
It's amazing that 1937 work,

602
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,410
you know,
in 1930,

603
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:18,520
whatever it was,
and they made cannabis legal was a 37 to

604
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,770
this day.
It still affected me a massive amount of

605
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,360
couple of generations.
You know,

606
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,450
they just had to just get grandpa and 
grandma just get them and then they'll 

607
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,281
get to tell their kids and they're going
to tell their kids and everyone's going 

608
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:34,441
to be scared.
Well now there's a huge movement in 

609
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:37,220
geriatric and geriatrics.
Geriatric medical marijuana real.

610
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:41,360
And I know some one geriatric doctor who
is prescribing it for his patients.

611
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:42,080
I,
I've,

612
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,580
I've know some anecdotal evidence of,
of older people in nursing homes and all

613
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:48,770
that have had some marvelous things 
happen to them.

614
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:53,020
So it's finally getting into a GRANDPA 
and grandma do.

615
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,620
Wow.
That's amazing.

616
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,740
It's amazing.
After all these years,

617
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,050
people are finally starting to catch on.

618
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,460
Yeah.
I've turned on people in their sixties 

619
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,270
that were very anti anti-drug,
but they are all of a sudden all this 

620
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,331
pain or they're,
they're going through cancer treatments 

621
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:10,331
or something there,
you know,

622
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:11,620
they can't keep their food down.
And I said,

623
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:12,770
hey,
try this Brownie.

624
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:17,771
You know,
and pretty soon they're going to the 

625
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:17,771
dispensary regularly,
you know,

626
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:22,060
especially if you lived your life 
without it and you thought this is all 

627
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,560
it's available now all of a sudden you 
have this new cabi your own.

628
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:26,600
You can't move around much.
Hey,

629
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:27,970
you know,
there's something I can do here.

630
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,990
Reduces inflammation to a lot of people 
that have serious problems with walking 

631
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,620
around.
They take some pot and it just makes you

632
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:37,570
all loosey Goosey as a lot of folks that
have experienced that pain relief from.

633
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,560
Especially if it's high in CBDS.
Right.

634
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,810
I,
I use it for pain relief.

635
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,810
And actually,
I,

636
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:43,460
I,
uh,

637
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,640
when I'm in pain,
I can't tell it I'm high when I smoke 

638
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:48,640
it,
but the pain doesn't,

639
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,060
I don't think it goes away except you 
just don't pay attention to it.

640
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,790
I don't know what the mechanism is about
Ufo shows.

641
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,700
Have you ever had any experience that,
uh,

642
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,230
when you were,
um,

643
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:05,290
on any sort of a psychedelic that you 
felt was like some sort of a paranormal 

644
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:10,781
experience,
like a Ufo experience or like being in 

645
00:26:10,781 --> 00:26:12,590
contact with something or seeing 
something that you,

646
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:17,591
uh,
you experienced where it felt like it 

647
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:17,591
was a real thing?
Yeah,

648
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:18,110
yeah,
several times.

649
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,600
Uh,
mainly on Iowasca.

650
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,320
But,
uh,

651
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:26,321
there was,
there was one time that you still is 

652
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:26,870
just crystal clear to me where there was
this.

653
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,150
We're sitting in darkness,
you know,

654
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:34,151
and it appeared like there was a black 
curtain in front of me was just a really

655
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:39,770
bright light coming out from the bottom 
and from back behind me,

656
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:42,410
this,
this female kind of entity,

657
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:45,090
I,
it was just very dark and shadowy.

658
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,880
I said,
what is that?

659
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,430
And this,
you know,

660
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,670
this could be going on in my head.
I,

661
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:54,210
I admit that,
but to me it was real and this entity,

662
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,740
she said,
well,

663
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:58,890
that's what you are really made of.
That's your core,

664
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,920
do you want to see it?
And she reaches down and start to pull 

665
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,320
this up.
And it started getting so bright.

666
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:04,830
I said,
no,

667
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,530
no,
no,

668
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,040
I got scared.
I don't know why.

669
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,960
And uh,
some of my friends said,

670
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,750
I can't believe you didn't let her pick 
it up,

671
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,320
you know,
but it was,

672
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,230
it was like a message,
like you are this bright,

673
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:21,231
shining spirit behind this thing.
To me that was a real entity and counter

674
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:23,470
of some kind.
So you think that that was like an inter

675
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:26,670
dimensional thing that you were 
communicating with or could have been or

676
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:28,460
could have been a figment of my 
imagination.

677
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:28,940
You know,
I,

678
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,920
I,
I've not tried to distinguish between it

679
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:36,921
because the emotional impact of what 
went on and what I was thinking and 

680
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:40,050
saying and frayed to look at my own core
was kind of fascinating,

681
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:40,290
you know?

682
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Well,
it's also what is the source of the 

683
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,321
imagination and why is the imagination 
so obviously affected by different 

684
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:49,980
chemicals.
And where's the imagination come from?

685
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,490
Exactly what the imagination is clearly 
affected by cannabis,

686
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,450
clearly also affected by caffeine,
clearly also affected by alcohol,

687
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,450
definitely affected by Psilocybin,
definitely affected by many,

688
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:01,560
many,
many other things.

689
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:06,561
Airplane Glue will do it.
You have ideas that are different than 

690
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:07,260
the ideas that you have if you're in a 
baseline sober consciousness,

691
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:12,470
and the real question then becomes what 
exactly is imagination?

692
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,680
Is Imagination just a series of 
chemicals interacting with neurons,

693
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:19,650
interacting with thoughts and ideas and 
learned experiences.

694
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:25,010
Because out of the imagination comes 
everything that everyone ever used on 

695
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,780
earth.
The thing that wasn't here already,

696
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,810
anything we made,
whether it's a phone or a television set

697
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:34,350
or a curtain that all came out of the 
imagination.

698
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,600
So the imagination isn't just something 
where you think things up and they.

699
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,550
Well,
you know,

700
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,450
maybe I just imagined it.
Nothing happens without imagination.

701
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:47,451
Exactly.
The imagination is the source of every 

702
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:50,001
single creation.
It's a weird thing when you look at it 

703
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:52,851
that way.
Well you don't look at it as something 

704
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:52,851
like,
Oh,

705
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:52,851
you're just imagining things that aren't
really there.

706
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:52,851
Right?
Well,

707
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:57,830
you're also imagining the wheel.
You're also imagining Internet 

708
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:57,830
connections.
You're also imagining airplanes.

709
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,330
Yeah.
Somebody had to imagine all of those,

710
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,930
all of that.
Without that,

711
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:04,110
there's nothing.
Without the human imagination,

712
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,540
the world would look radically 
different.

713
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:09,150
It would be 100 percent natural and we'd
be animals.

714
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,600
The imagination is the one step that 
takes us from animal into animal that 

715
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,330
changes its environment radically and 
starts to transcend itself,

716
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,870
starts to symbiotically attach itself to
its own creations,

717
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,810
which coincidentally came out of the 
imagination.

718
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:29,930
The imagination created technology that 
like the glasses you're wearing or the 

719
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:34,311
watch I'm wearing or any,
any of the things we're talking through 

720
00:29:34,311 --> 00:29:37,071
these microphones.
All of that is technology created 

721
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:37,071
through the imagination,
right?

722
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,880
Shoes or tech,
you know,

723
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,770
so when you see something and you say,
well,

724
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:42,100
maybe it was my imagination.

725
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,800
I'm not exactly sure what that means.
See,

726
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,840
I don't really care whether it's my 
imagination or some other 

727
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,640
multidimensional entity.
What I focus on,

728
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,010
what am I learning?
What am I feeling?

729
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:59,011
First of all,
what's my emotional state and then what 

730
00:29:59,011 --> 00:29:59,080
am I going to take away from this?
What am I going to learn?

731
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,210
And,
uh,

732
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,140
recently,
uh,

733
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:06,180
podcast,
I put out Mckenna says something to the 

734
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,990
effect of what makes us think that,
that the entire cosmos can be understood

735
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,110
using the neural network of a primate.
He says,

736
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,130
we're here to observe and appreciate.
And I like that,

737
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:17,360
you know,
rather than try to figure out black or a

738
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,270
dark matter and all that,
that's great.

739
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:24,271
I'm glad people are working on it,
but I'm not gonna worry about it too 

740
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:24,271
much.
I'm,

741
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:24,380
I'm going gonna appreciate.
And,

742
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:24,990
and,
uh,

743
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,190
you know,
look at the wonder of the world.

744
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,850
Just look at nature.
It's just amazing.

745
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,040
Mengele known just looked at all the 
different varieties of insects.

746
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,280
They're just freaky,
weird,

747
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:41,610
alien creatures that we just take for 
granted because they've always been 

748
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:41,610
here.
Well,

749
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,990
spiders,
we couldn't live without spiders,

750
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:45,580
you know,
or bees or bees.

751
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,070
And that's getting to be a problem.
It certainly is.

752
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,690
And there's a lot of theories about 
that.

753
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:53,260
But one of the more fascinating ones to 
me is that they are absolutely convinced

754
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:55,270
that whether or not they can survive it 
or not,

755
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,570
cell phone signals are damaging.
B's got to be.

756
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,620
It's,
it's fucking with the way they end 

757
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:03,620
people powered lines and cell phone 
towers.

758
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:03,790
You don't want to live near any of 
those.

759
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:07,660
Yeah.
Well I think that a high power lines has

760
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:12,661
there been a direct correlation ever 
established between them and sicknesses 

761
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:16,021
between some high powered lines,
not the real super high frequency power 

762
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:17,060
lines you had.

763
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,490
There had been in effect,
uh,

764
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,560
I know somebody who died of cancer quite
young who lived under those for a long 

765
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,880
time.
And now that was anecdotal,

766
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:27,880
but I think there has been,
there have been some studies now showing

767
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,780
because people in certain neighborhoods 
have sued and things like that.

768
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,570
I've been around him before where you 
feel them.

769
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,620
Yeah.
And can feel that weird fee here.

770
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,180
You're sanding necks and you kind of 
feel a buzz around you.

771
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,300
We just realized like,
this is enough energy to kill everyone 

772
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,481
you've ever met ever instantly.
And it's just shooting through these 

773
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:51,550
wire lines.
Well,

774
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:56,551
we don't know what we're doing to 
ourselves with all these electronic 

775
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:56,551
signals.
You know,

776
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:57,820
you can't get away from it when there's 
Wifi everywhere now.

777
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,220
There's no cell phones.
There's TV,

778
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:05,221
there's radio.
Think of the information that's just in 

779
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:05,260
this room that we can't see.

780
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,570
But with the right equipment we can tune
into.

781
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,900
Well,
that's where it's going to be really 

782
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:12,900
weird when that equipment is actually 
inside your brain itself.

783
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,300
Yeah.
That's going to be very,

784
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:14,080
very,
very,

785
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:16,200
very strange.
It's getting there to us.

786
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,060
So close.
You know,

787
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,100
they gave the person that first ticket 
for wearing google glass.

788
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:22,690
I saw,
I saw that,

789
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:27,691
you know,
and I think that was a valid issue of a 

790
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:30,481
ticket to.
I don't want people driving and looking 

791
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,431
at Google at the same time or I don't 
like people talking on their cell phone 

792
00:32:32,431 --> 00:32:36,511
unless they have hands free.
My question is how can they prove that 

793
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:39,001
it's active?
Because if you just have that thing on 

794
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:39,001
your eyes,
you can't.

795
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:39,860
I,
I think the beat that ticket.

796
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:40,100
But

797
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,410
uh,
I think it sends a message.

798
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,840
Yeah.
The cops don't like technology.

799
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,320
Well,
they liked the technology they have.

800
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,930
It's also the other messages.
They like writing tickets.

801
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:56,030
Oh yeah.
They want to write as many as they can 

802
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,070
and they have to fill quotas.
Feeling quote as one of the most 

803
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:02,051
disgusting things anybody ever got away 
with the idea that there has to be a 

804
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:03,710
certain amount of crimes that are 
committed in a month.

805
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:08,150
Like what if everybody agreed to only go
the speed limit for like a year.

806
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,270
What would happen with the police 
officers just explode?

807
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,760
I mean,
what would they do if we all agreed that

808
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,550
that would be an interesting project and
some small town.

809
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:21,551
If you could get everybody to do it,
then nobody has any money that's coming 

810
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:21,551
in from.
From speeding tickets.

811
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:22,730
What do they do?
Because they rely on it,

812
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,100
you know,
they rely on it for a source of income.

813
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,110
It's those couple of little towns on the
way to burning man.

814
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:29,570
That's,
that's most of their income is insane.

815
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,150
I mean,
look,

816
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,770
it's one thing if you want to tickets 
someone because you want to give them an

817
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:35,960
incentive to slow down,
to make people safer.

818
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,350
That's one thing,
but as soon as you start developing like

819
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,590
you have a standard amount of money you 
have to make every month from you just 

820
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:48,701
saying that people never improve,
you're just saying that people will 

821
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:51,290
never get better at following the law,
never get better at being safer and just

822
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:54,500
the fact that you bank on that you have 
a quota that's disgusting,

823
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,640
but they were known speed traps and in 
Texas you know that you wouldn't go 

824
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,101
through this town because it was 15 
miles an hour and 16 and get you a 

825
00:34:03,101 --> 00:34:03,101
ticket.
Connecticut's horrible.

826
00:34:03,101 --> 00:34:04,610
As Connecticut.
Between Connecticut and Boston,

827
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,640
there's a lot of stretches where it's 55
fucking miles an hour and 56 and there 

828
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,940
is nothing there.

829
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,090
It's just straight line and you just 
want a gun it,

830
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:19,091
you want to get the New York between New
York and Boston's like three and a half 

831
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:22,690
hours at 55 miles an hour.
We're just going cheese a scrape right 

832
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,720
everywhere you looked.
Some asshole disguises a tree pointing a

833
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:30,721
radar Acha so stupid.
And now Jamie put up a picture just a 

834
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:32,830
moment ago,
but now in,

835
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,310
uh,
in Colorado,

836
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,870
they're developing this new technology 
to tell if someone's smoking pot and not

837
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:43,871
look at these things,
tell if someone's smoking pot enough 

838
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:46,520
inside of a building for it,
the smell to leak outside.

839
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:51,521
So they've developed this instrument 
that measures the amount of cannabis 

840
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:55,211
smell in the air on the street and 
they're going to start to give people 

841
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:55,211
tickets for these things,
you know,

842
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:58,940
that'll help vaporizer sales.
Well this is in Colorado pot legal,

843
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:00,260
this is so fucking stupid.

844
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,120
Those are the 40 percent that didn't 
vote for it.

845
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,420
It may be that or it may just be the 
fact that people are just floating out 

846
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,570
of control and just weeds blowing 
everywhere.

847
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:09,200
Like,
you know,

848
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:14,210
like tumbleweed.
I like the smell of weed just wafting 

849
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:17,261
through entire communities and people 
are catching contact ties and they've 

850
00:35:17,261 --> 00:35:17,261
had enough.
But you're not used to be.

851
00:35:17,261 --> 00:35:21,531
You'd put your pot in coffee and the 
dogs couldn't smell it for now they've 

852
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:23,360
trained the dogs to look for the coffee 
as well.

853
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,150
I don't know if this is true,
but a friend of mine told me that,

854
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:31,510
oh,
what he's been doing is buying a bear 

855
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,391
pis and wolf pis and sprinkling it 
around his tire tires and in his trunk 

856
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,850
because he says when the drug dog smells
it and they go crazy,

857
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:40,320
they forget about drugs.
Totally.

858
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:41,520
And they want to go attack,
tackle bear,

859
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:43,560
you know,
I don't know if the cops do.

860
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,030
I don't.
I don't know at this.

861
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,580
Probably is made up,
but it's a great story.

862
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:49,950
You wouldn't think it would be made up.
I mean,

863
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:52,080
dogs instinctively freak out and they 
smell wolves.

864
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,170
Yeah.
And so a pete's coffee.

865
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,940
Yeah.
That seems to make sense.

866
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,810
That's.
Hmm.

867
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,800
I wonder if they can get in trouble for 
like pasting wolf piss on your tires.

868
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,460
How do they prove that they have a wolf 
piss knows.

869
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,410
Then they put it on and bring in the 
wolf dog.

870
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,240
They have a wolf piss detecting device 
just like they have a cannabis smell 

871
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,240
detecting device,
but there's some,

872
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,010
some sense that a dog can't resist that.
You know the one cent that supposedly 

873
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,731
universally applies to all animals that 
brings in here brings an lps and Moose 

874
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,020
beavers piss.
Really?

875
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,970
Yeah.
Beaver smell or beaver,

876
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,470
beaver,
estrogen,

877
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,910
whatever it is.
Beaver sent.

878
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,530
I know a lot of young men to go after.

879
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:36,950
Exactly.
Which is interesting that term be 

880
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,950
because they don't look like,
look,

881
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,730
if you're a woman's vagina,
looks like a beaver.

882
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,080
Take her to a doctor.
Something wrong.

883
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,480
It's not supposed to look like that.
So if you call into the beaver,

884
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:45,720
why are you calling it a beaver?
Because somebody else did before because

885
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:50,730
it's.
Well then the other idea is that it was 

886
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:50,730
created back when they were really 
hairy,

887
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,850
mean we don't know about the Internet 
for porn before an Internet porn.

888
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:54,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

889
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:56,910
Porn in the Internet.
I think porn got women to trim it down a

890
00:36:56,911 --> 00:36:59,340
little bit and the imminent,
the Internet came along and it was just,

891
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,200
it was just fire through bushes,
just the cube.

892
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,360
But apparently the scent from the glands
of Beavers is,

893
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:14,361
uh,
the best sexual attractant for other 

894
00:37:14,361 --> 00:37:14,550
animals.
Never go figure.

895
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,380
Yeah.
I don't know what that's about.

896
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,380
I mean,
who thought that the beavers were the 

897
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,571
studs of the animal world?
There's certainly a weird fucking 

898
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:24,270
animal,
meaning if you see one in real life.

899
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,000
Oh yeah.
You know,

900
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:30,020
and you see their crazy houses that they
built next to the lakes were these 

901
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,970
giants in little lake in a canoe and 
paddle out there and there was a big 

902
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:33,660
beaver dam there.
You could watch them.

903
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,300
Then they were busy as beavers.
Busy as beavers.

904
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,730
Otters around there.
And people eat them,

905
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,030
delete them.
Apparently they own tastes bad.

906
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,840
I don't know.
I guess when people are starving to 

907
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:47,840
death,
you know,

908
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,360
I watch a lot of those,
uh,

909
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:53,361
Alaska shows where people live in Alaska
and eat whatever they can get ahold of 

910
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:53,820
them.
A lot of people eat beaver up there.

911
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:56,940
They eat beaver tails that cook the 
beavertail.

912
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,950
That sounds like it'd be pretty tough.

913
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,170
Cld eat a lot of seal.
Marinade it.

914
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,250
Yeah.
Seal and beaver and you know,

915
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:09,570
gotta what you got to eat,
whatever the hell you can get ahold of 

916
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:09,570
up there.
Probably.

917
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,350
If you didn't know what it was,
you'd say,

918
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:11,570
Hey,
this is kind of interesting.

919
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,940
It can't be picky,
they just need a source of calories and 

920
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:16,940
protein.
Protein.

921
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,250
Yeah,
that's right there.

922
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,660
Take it.
You know,

923
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:23,661
and apparently seal oil is very 
important for them because it's very 

924
00:38:23,661 --> 00:38:25,680
high in calories and the cold you deal 
with apparently that's one of the best.

925
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:30,710
The worst losses of caloric or of 
calories is your body burning off 

926
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:37,070
calories to keep itself warm.
It's like one of the best they say to 

927
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:40,951
lose weight is to actually to walk 
around with like less jacket or less 

928
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:46,020
coats.
Then you would feel comfortable with 

929
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,150
because your body in order to keep warm 
is actually burning off and on.

930
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:51,270
That's interesting.
So are you going to go hunting in 

931
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,270
Alaska?
No,

932
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,430
I'm going in Wisconsin.
I'm going,

933
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:53,260
I said this weekend.
Oh Wow.

934
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,160
Yeah.
I would go in Alaska too though.

935
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,110
What are you going to after dear?
Huh?

936
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,700
Yeah.
There's a guy who's got a farm.

937
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:03,730
It's overrun with deer and he brings in 
people to hunt them,

938
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:06,280
to manage them every year because the,
you know,

939
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:07,690
the reality is,
as you said,

940
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,750
especially in Wisconsin,
a lot of them are going to die by 

941
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,061
predators.
A lot of them are going to get hit by 

942
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,591
cars.
A lot of them are going to freeze to 

943
00:39:16,591 --> 00:39:17,821
death and you,
in order to keep the herd healthy 

944
00:39:17,821 --> 00:39:20,810
managed,
you gotta you gotta finish and you've 

945
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:23,020
got to be the wolf and I want to.
I want to try to live this entire year.

946
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:28,050
I want to.
I want to pick a time like after the 

947
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,170
first of the year and tried to live the 
entire year on game meat.

948
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,990
I think it's possible.
I think it's possible.

949
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,030
I think if you're going to be a meat 
eater,

950
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,190
you know,
to know the exact source of your meat.

951
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:42,150
I think it's probably the best,
most ethical and sort of sane way to do 

952
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,590
it.
The disconnect between us and our food,

953
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,290
whether they're like,
I love growing food in a garden and then

954
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:49,420
cooking and eating the vegetables that 
you grow.

955
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,040
I mean,
I think it's a beautiful thing.

956
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:56,041
It's,
it's an interesting connection that you 

957
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:56,041
have between where your food actually 
comes from.

958
00:39:56,041 --> 00:40:00,391
I have chickens now and I get,
I get fresh eggs from the chickens and 

959
00:40:00,391 --> 00:40:01,210
I'm trying to get closer and closer to 
my food,

960
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:02,080
if that makes any sense.

961
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,340
Well,
we mainly organic or almost all organic,

962
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:10,341
but mainly vegetables.
We eat chicken maybe twice a month and 

963
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:10,570
we have a friend that slaughters his,
uh,

964
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,220
his pig once a year and we know how it's
grown and raised and everything.

965
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,200
But uh,
mainly vegetarians,

966
00:40:16,201 --> 00:40:17,580
but it,
all our food,

967
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,850
most of it comes within a 25 to 40 miles
of our house,

968
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,530
you know,
that's.

969
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,810
We belong to a CSA community supported 
agriculture and,

970
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,630
and I do most of the cooking and so it's
really fun.

971
00:40:27,631 --> 00:40:32,631
You get this box each week and then you 
got to figure out what you're going to 

972
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:32,631
do with stuff and that's really cool.

973
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:33,860
That's a lot of fun.
I would love that.

974
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:36,320
I think I've talked to my friends about 
that with everyone.

975
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:38,030
So God damn busy,
we'd never get anything done.

976
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:43,300
But the idea of getting together,
everybody buying in on a plot of land 

977
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:48,310
and then hiring someone to run that plot
of land and produce food for this group 

978
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,450
of people,
like say get 20 people together and say,

979
00:40:50,451 --> 00:40:52,100
well this is our grocery bill for the 
year.

980
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:56,150
If we can manage a plot of land and buy 
a plot of land together,

981
00:40:56,151 --> 00:40:58,430
everybody pay for one slash 20th of it 
or whatever,

982
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:02,250
and then hire someone to take care of 
everything and hire a few people.

983
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,640
I'd be some CSA is up here.
There must be,

984
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:10,080
you know,
there's several of them in San Diego 

985
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,890
County and we belonged to to this one 
for quite a few years now and they 

986
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:15,551
supply most of the local organic stores 
and so what we're getting are the 

987
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,430
tomatoes that are other heirloom,
they're not perfect.

988
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,860
They're in.
We're getting food from a farm.

989
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,590
Like it'd become a.
not everything's the same size and shape

990
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:25,590
and all like that.
It's real.

991
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,900
It's real food is picked that day or 
maybe the afternoon before and it's real

992
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:34,901
good fresh food,
but that way we don't have to get our 

993
00:41:34,901 --> 00:41:34,901
group together.
Now we're,

994
00:41:34,901 --> 00:41:39,460
we've gotten a bunch of people involved 
in this and some people don't like 

995
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,460
pomegranates,
persimmons or whatever comes sometimes 

996
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,470
in the basket and so we swapped around 
with each other and stuff and uh,

997
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,050
so we usually eat everything,
so I get all the throwaways idea,

998
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,350
had a bit of doomsday to it.

999
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,690
My idea was like if the shit hits the 
fan,

1000
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,970
you're in the survival stuff and you 
know,

1001
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:57,971
you read all that too.
And when I was younger I was into that 

1002
00:41:57,971 --> 00:41:57,971
too.
But now that I,

1003
00:41:57,971 --> 00:41:58,520
you know,
my dad,

1004
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:03,521
my brother and my mentor all died at 63,
so I'm eight years past my expiration 

1005
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,960
dates.
So I feel like it's all free time.

1006
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,000
I exercise,
I eat well,

1007
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:09,140
but you know,
it's,

1008
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,850
it's,
I'm not stressed about that.

1009
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:13,760
I see the Google kids are working on 
longevity,

1010
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:14,540
uh,
things now.

1011
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:16,760
And,
and I just commented a friend yesterday,

1012
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:21,761
I said,
you ever noticed that all of this at 

1013
00:42:21,761 --> 00:42:21,920
longevity work is done by people in 
their thirties and forties,

1014
00:42:21,921 --> 00:42:23,630
but,
but I'm here seventies or eighties.

1015
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:24,650
You say,
oh no,

1016
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:26,600
I don't really need that.
I've had a lot of fun.

1017
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:28,880
I want to have a little bit more fun,
but you know,

1018
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,600
if you gave me,
you said here's a pill,

1019
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,850
give you another 100 years.

1020
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,550
I'd have to think long and hard about 
that.

1021
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,450
Really?
Yeah.

1022
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,460
Oh yeah.
Because you would worry about 

1023
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:40,460
deterioration or no,
you're not having fun.

1024
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,330
Well,
because,

1025
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:46,331
uh,
there's a lot of pain and watching your 

1026
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:46,331
friends go through what they're going to
have to go through.

1027
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:51,011
Everybody's going to go through love 
affairs that are broken and tragedies 

1028
00:42:51,011 --> 00:42:52,390
and stuff like that.
I just don't want to watch anymore that,

1029
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:52,790
you know,
I,

1030
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,740
I,
I love affairs.

1031
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,670
That's the big push over the edge.
No,

1032
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,430
it's,
I'm thinking of my grandkids now.

1033
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,460
Oh,
they're getting their hearts broken and 

1034
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,150
everything.
We were talking about the radio lab 

1035
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,161
thing earlier about the guy who went 
through this horrible circumcision 

1036
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:11,270
process of becoming a runner.
Wouldn't want a son to go through it.

1037
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,120
Yeah.
You don't want your kids to grow through

1038
00:43:14,121 --> 00:43:19,121
heartbreak.
My children who've already gone through 

1039
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:22,060
heartbreak now it's my grandkids and I 
pour it and I told one of my 

1040
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,060
grandchildren.

1041
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,060
I said,
you know,

1042
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,490
if I'm not around when some young man 
breaks your heart,

1043
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:31,060
I will come back and haunt him.
She remembers that the guys,

1044
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,940
why is it his fault?
He doesn't want to be around her 

1045
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:36,940
anymore.
Well,

1046
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:36,940
see,
I'm,

1047
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:36,940
I,
I have four,

1048
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,910
five grandchildren,
four girls.

1049
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,700
If it wasn't for that,
I'd have a little problem with women,

1050
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,530
but I have a new sensitivity to women.
Well,

1051
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,280
I have a very good sensitivity to women 
too and I have three daughters,

1052
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:51,281
but my point is that a lot of heartbreak
comes from the fact that people just 

1053
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:52,760
decide they don't want to be with you 
anymore and it doesn't work out right.

1054
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,620
And people think that when someone 
leaves them,

1055
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:56,090
that they're taking something away from 
them,

1056
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:59,450
they feel this deep sense of loss and 
they're connected to the idea.

1057
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:03,530
Part of growing as a person is realizing
you're going to be okay and here's where

1058
00:44:03,531 --> 00:44:06,230
mtma would be really cool if it was 
legal.

1059
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,420
Because when you and your partner gets 
points say,

1060
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,730
you know,
if it's bad for one person,

1061
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,980
it's going to be bad for both of them.
Even if you're not talking about it,

1062
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,560
so if you sat down,
got together one evening,

1063
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:18,440
just the two of you did Mtma and talked 
it out.

1064
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,080
Now I know from personal experience 
that,

1065
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:26,150
you know,
my marriage with my previous marriage 

1066
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,841
was really getting rocky when I found 
the MTMA and we stayed together another 

1067
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:29,440
six,
seven years.

1068
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:30,650
That good?
Yeah.

1069
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:31,720
It really worked out good.
Yeah.

1070
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,780
Because,
because it died after that.

1071
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,280
Well,
the kids were grown with.

1072
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:37,750
A lot of things happened after that,
but.

1073
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:42,690
But it did extend our marriage and 
extended it and a really good way.

1074
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:43,300
Oh,
that's great.

1075
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:48,320
And we were married 21 years and we're,
we're good friends now who was a rocky 

1076
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,851
period for awhile,
but we've worked ourselves through that 

1077
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:52,851
to where,
you know,

1078
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:56,960
we both respect each other and we 
realized that it was not a one way 

1079
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:56,960
street.
But uh,

1080
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,590
you know,
I think that Mbma would be great for 

1081
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:01,590
couples therapy of people,
uh,

1082
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,570
when they hit that seven year mark or 
whatever it is,

1083
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:03,780
you know?

1084
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,190
Yeah.
Well,

1085
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:10,191
I think there's a lot of things that 
people hold in depressing relationships 

1086
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:14,350
and don't communicate about,
and then sometimes the psychedelic 

1087
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,821
journey together can open those ideas up
and you start talking about things and 

1088
00:45:16,821 --> 00:45:19,671
you find out that there's been a 
misunderstanding all along or that it 

1089
00:45:19,671 --> 00:45:22,851
could a bit of lack of communication 
that you could have worked things out 

1090
00:45:22,851 --> 00:45:25,341
much better,
much easier a long time ago or that 

1091
00:45:25,341 --> 00:45:25,580
you're both feeling the same way.
They both want to move on,

1092
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,400
you just don't know how to do it.

1093
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,520
And you know,
I've had one experience where I went on 

1094
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,931
for months,
something was building up and finally 

1095
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:34,931
got it out and she said,
oh,

1096
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:40,180
that's no big deal and it's something 
that had been a big deal to me for a 

1097
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,751
long time.
And it turned out if I had just been 

1098
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:45,491
talking about it,
I would've had a month of bliss instead 

1099
00:45:45,491 --> 00:45:45,491
of hell.
You know?

1100
00:45:45,491 --> 00:45:49,241
So communication is the key and there 
are some things that help you 

1101
00:45:49,241 --> 00:45:49,670
communicate.
Pot helps you communicate.

1102
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Yeah.
Don't you think that those things and 

1103
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:54,800
those heartaches and those,
that's part of what makes you a person.

1104
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,850
It's information you have to get that 
information.

1105
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:57,600
It's feedback

1106
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,680
now.
I wouldn't want to not have any of my 

1107
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:02,680
heartbreaks and stuff.

1108
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,760
I just don't want.
I don't want to see it happen to 

1109
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,551
somebody.
I understand and I agree to a certain 

1110
00:46:08,551 --> 00:46:11,671
extent,
but I think it's very important that 

1111
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:13,411
everybody goes through a certain amount 
of it just to understand what it's 

1112
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:13,411
about,
but you don't have a choice.

1113
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:17,460
You're going to look.
I've had friends that have gone through 

1114
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,350
it where I know they.
They became better people because of it.

1115
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:23,460
Yeah.
A friend who went through a devastating 

1116
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,520
breakup and now he laughs about the idea
of being stuck with that woman.

1117
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,880
You know?
Back then he thought there was no way 

1118
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:29,880
you could live without her,
and I was like,

1119
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:29,880
yeah,
it doesn't.

1120
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:29,880
Yeah.

1121
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,950
No matter what happens to you,
how big the tragedy is that after some 

1122
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:38,230
time passes,
eventually that becomes one of your 

1123
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:38,230
funniest stories.

1124
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:38,580
Oh,
I doubt it.

1125
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,070
Oh,
no.

1126
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:44,260
Right.
Some of these things that were did was 

1127
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,060
eaten by a wolf on talk,
now that I'm thinking about,

1128
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,120
fucking saw your family die in a plane 
crash.

1129
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,930
I'm thinking of things happened to me.
Fucking crazy.

1130
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,970
If you think about some things that 
happened,

1131
00:46:51,971 --> 00:46:56,250
seemed to be a tragedy at the time and 
usually between people carve brands just

1132
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,620
talking about like breakups.
I'm talking about like getting fired.

1133
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:01,760
I'm talking about things that are not 
really devastated.

1134
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:05,050
Getting fired is a good thing.
I've had that happen sometimes that that

1135
00:47:05,051 --> 00:47:10,051
can turn into a good thing.
It can be a changing experience and 

1136
00:47:10,051 --> 00:47:11,060
change I think oftentimes opens up the 
door for good.

1137
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:11,800
Yeah.
You know,

1138
00:47:11,801 --> 00:47:15,070
change opened up the door for good 
because it gives you a new found focus.

1139
00:47:15,071 --> 00:47:16,060
You know,
if you survive it,

1140
00:47:16,061 --> 00:47:17,380
you're going to be stronger.
Yeah.

1141
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:22,381
Every time I've like had something 
happened to me where I had to rethink 

1142
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:22,510
things,
that's always been a good thing.

1143
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,770
Oh yeah,
and when you get fired,

1144
00:47:23,771 --> 00:47:24,970
you all right,
what are we doing here?

1145
00:47:24,971 --> 00:47:26,320
And you all of a sudden you get this new
motor.

1146
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,980
I realized subjectively this would be a 
good thing for grandkids

1147
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,020
when it happens to him.
I just don't want to go through.

1148
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,240
That's part of being a GRANDPA.
I mean,

1149
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,480
isn't that what they always say that the
strictest parents were always like the 

1150
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:39,890
most lenient grandparents?
I wasn't a strict parenthood.

1151
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,680
Even more so than even more lenient,
but yeah,

1152
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:48,750
the idea,
especially when you're an older person 

1153
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,601
and you've experienced so much pain and 
hardship and you see the innocence of 

1154
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:53,770
children whose how beautiful it is,
they don't know any racism yet.

1155
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,800
They don't know any homophobia yet.
They don't know any blind objective 

1156
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,670
hate.
They don't know they.

1157
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:01,810
They don't know the disillusion of 
government.

1158
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:02,890
They don't know all this.
Right?

1159
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:08,070
They don't know any of this yet.
They don't know like they don't read 

1160
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:12,090
the,
the rebellion against taxing and it's 

1161
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:12,370
like all the different aspects of 
society that,

1162
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:17,080
you know,
bring people to this hysterical freakout

1163
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,930
point where you're like,
this fucking thing is I'm mad as hell.

1164
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,470
I'm not going to take it anymore.
I'm like,

1165
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:24,040
I love that.
Yeah.

1166
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:25,570
They don't have that.
They have,

1167
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,920
you know,
you stepped on my toe,

1168
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,750
they have,
that's my toy,

1169
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,490
you know,
relatively speaking,

1170
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:35,491
these are big problems for them to all 
the little kid problems that we just 

1171
00:48:35,491 --> 00:48:36,100
have to learn how to work our way 
through.

1172
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:40,840
And my three year old has a way bigger 
problem with my five year old taking one

1173
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:43,450
of her toys than I have with anything in
life.

1174
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:49,330
My five-year-old takes her toy and she,
she screams tiers are flying out of her 

1175
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,360
face.
That never happens to me.

1176
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,030
So for her,
that's a devastating apocalypse.

1177
00:48:55,031 --> 00:48:57,060
A huge groups of toys.
Yeah,

1178
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,500
it really is.
It's relative,

1179
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:02,110
relatively speaking,
and you have to address it that way.

1180
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:07,440
You have to sort of respect the fact 
that they actually are freaking out and 

1181
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,910
although it doesn't seem normal to you,
you are grown adults.

1182
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:14,940
Right?
But for a three year old this you've to 

1183
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,280
that this is a real serious thing for 
them,

1184
00:49:15,281 --> 00:49:20,281
you know?
And so you got to treat them like 

1185
00:49:20,281 --> 00:49:20,281
adults.
My parents didn't shut up,

1186
00:49:20,281 --> 00:49:20,290
you know,
that's how I grew up.

1187
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,880
Shut up.
Shut your mouth.

1188
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:24,190
I'll break both your legs.
That's the type of shit I heard.

1189
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,450
I was.
I was really lucky.

1190
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:27,700
I grew up liking an ozzie and Harriet 
family.

1191
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:29,050
It was,
it was my problem.

1192
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:34,051
Yeah.
But I couldn't have asked for better 

1193
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:34,370
parents and we were looking at it.
Turned out ecstasy dealer.

1194
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,480
Dallas drug dealer sends him to college.
He deals well hosting a drug podcast.

1195
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,240
Guys.
Crazy.

1196
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,400
What is this book that you wrote?
The spirit of the Internet.

1197
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:45,840
Uh,
that's,

1198
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,470
that's,
uh,

1199
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,480
I wrote that in 2000 actually.
It's one of the first books that 

1200
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,361
compares the Internet to a psychedelic 
drug speculations on the evolution of 

1201
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:54,361
growth.

1202
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:55,560
Global consciousness.
Yeah.

1203
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,470
Wow.
Look at you.

1204
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:58,110
You fresh faced little.
Yeah.

1205
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:01,540
That's a long time ago.
That's 2000 when you wrote this in 2000,

1206
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,680
13 years ago.
I.

1207
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:07,660
That was the last nonfiction I wrote.
I've got a fiction book up now.

1208
00:50:07,661 --> 00:50:09,960
That's a first of a quartet I'm writing.
But uh,

1209
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,440
uh,
I went to fiction because it's so much 

1210
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:15,440
more fun.
Do you remember sort of Graham Hancock?

1211
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,940
Did you,
do you remember when people thought that

1212
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,900
the world was gonna end in 2000?
Oh yeah.

1213
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,510
Y Two k,
well that was a big deal,

1214
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:27,511
man.
See I got involved in y two K in about 

1215
00:50:27,511 --> 00:50:27,920
1995 because we,
we've

1216
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:33,100
set aside millions of dollars to fix all
those problems and most of the software 

1217
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:37,931
industry did.
I mean there was a huge thing and the 

1218
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:41,471
press only picked up on in the last nine
months or something and we'd already 

1219
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,160
spent millions of dollars and years and 
years of work.

1220
00:50:43,161 --> 00:50:47,060
There's specialized companies working on
it and so I really didn't think anything

1221
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:52,061
bad was gonna happen.
I wouldn't want to be somewhere on an 

1222
00:50:52,061 --> 00:50:53,390
airplane right then because there were a
few glitches.

1223
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,350
Well,
I didn't know.

1224
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,710
I didn't think the airplane would crash.
I thought I could get stranded somewhere

1225
00:50:57,711 --> 00:50:59,780
and they couldn't get my reservations.
Oh right.

1226
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,390
I wouldn't worry about the plane itself.
That was a fear though.

1227
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:05,210
Like air traffic controllers that their,
their computer systems,

1228
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:07,400
we're going to go down.
There was a potential for that,

1229
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:12,401
but it was nothing like the press made.
What the fuck did they do for air 

1230
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:12,680
traffic controllers before there were 
computers,

1231
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:18,370
eyeball,
I guess radio and I will look in the 19 

1232
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:18,370
sixties.

1233
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:18,370
What?
How did they describe by cow?

1234
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,810
I guess it was like a coming in at 
30,000

1235
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:23,540
feet.
Twenty five degrees north.

1236
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,560
I got to talk them down.
I don't know.

1237
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,230
I'm a commercial pilot.
Vital I've got.

1238
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,020
Are you really?
But it's restricted to hot air balloons,

1239
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:35,090
commercial commercial pilot and it says 
restricted to lighter than air aircraft.

1240
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,770
Lighter than air.
And I,

1241
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:40,430
I don't have a balloon anymore,
but I used to fly balloons.

1242
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,600
Yeah.
Whoa,

1243
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:42,840
that's got to be spooky.
Oh,

1244
00:51:42,841 --> 00:51:45,970
they're great fun.
Like you in a basket near space.

1245
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,220
It's just awesome because now it gets 
loud when you burn,

1246
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:51,260
but then when you're not burning you're 
just floating.

1247
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,860
It's quiet and you could hear the sound,
you know,

1248
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:58,870
there's no obstruction.
So you can hear people talking on the 

1249
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:01,361
ground.
And in Dallas there's this one track 

1250
00:52:01,361 --> 00:52:04,151
that we had taken Sunday morning because
there was a woman who would lay out in 

1251
00:52:04,151 --> 00:52:04,310
her backyard but naked.

1252
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:05,990
Yeah.
So we would come in,

1253
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,520
we'd burn.
And then we'd,

1254
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,480
we'd come up high so that we coast down 
in low and come over the lake and just.

1255
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:15,160
And then we'd say good morning,
she jumped in.

1256
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,700
How rude.
Yeah,

1257
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:21,740
it was a,
you could hear everything in Texas cars 

1258
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,581
you'd fly or and Sunday morning and see 
pickup trucks with people passed out in 

1259
00:52:24,581 --> 00:52:24,710
the back of them and stuff.
Wow.

1260
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,660
With yell at them.
How dangerous is it though?

1261
00:52:26,661 --> 00:52:31,661
It seems like it's pretty dangerous.
The reason I quit is because I wasn't 

1262
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:35,171
paying close enough attention.
I almost hit a power line and it scared 

1263
00:52:35,171 --> 00:52:37,010
me so much.
I was flying people for money and stuff,

1264
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,610
you know,
at the time.

1265
00:52:37,611 --> 00:52:42,611
Oh my God.
I got wrapped up in the conversation 

1266
00:52:42,611 --> 00:52:42,980
these guys are having,
that's my problem in paying attention to

1267
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:44,150
them more than the flying.

1268
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,430
And they didn't know.
We had a close call.

1269
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,320
I knew we had close calls.
How close?

1270
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,020
Not that close.
Close enough.

1271
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,530
I,
I was coming down and I didn't burn soon

1272
00:52:54,531 --> 00:52:59,531
enough.
And so it takes a while to get your 

1273
00:52:59,531 --> 00:52:59,531
momentum backup and uh,
you know,

1274
00:52:59,531 --> 00:53:01,550
I cleared it by 50 feet.
But you know,

1275
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:03,620
I should have cleared it by 500 feet or 
something.

1276
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:03,820
Like,
no,

1277
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,240
I was coming in for a landing,
I guess.

1278
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,100
Anyhow,
it scared the hell out of me.

1279
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:07,960
And I said,
you know,

1280
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
that's it.
How many people had died hitting power 

1281
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000
lines?
So that's mainly,

1282
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000
it was just happened to people in 
balloons.

1283
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:14,750
Not,
not,

1284
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:17,270
not all that many compared to the number
of people flying,

1285
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:22,300
you know,
it's safer than regular aircraft or you 

1286
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:22,300
harnessed in when you're up there.
Oh No.

1287
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,050
Oh Jesus.
I used to sit on the edge of the basket,

1288
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:25,070
you know,
and burn.

1289
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,110
Really?
Oh yeah.

1290
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:31,490
Fucking a man.
What if a crazy rebel wind came along 

1291
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:31,490
and knocked you off?
Well,

1292
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:34,320
you wouldn't have launched.
If it's over 10 miles an hour,

1293
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:36,460
you wouldn't launch.
We have a lot of trouble for her.

1294
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,030
Look so spooky.
We'd curling my toes.

1295
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:40,310
Just sitting there looking at that 
video.

1296
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,830
We'd go to these airshows where they 
bring in biplanes and stuff like that.

1297
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:48,831
And for the balloons,
they would put up a pole in the middle 

1298
00:53:48,831 --> 00:53:52,940
of the airfield with the keys to a 
cadillac or something on it and you had 

1299
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:56,691
to go five miles away,
anywhere in the radius of five miles 

1300
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:56,730
away and launch and whoever could grab 
the keys,

1301
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:58,480
got the balloon.
Wow.

1302
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,830
What if they collide into each other?
You kind of bounce off.

1303
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:04,410
But if you're at the same altitude at 
least,

1304
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:06,720
but you the rules the road so you're not
supposed to do that.

1305
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:10,860
But nobody in things I ever flew in ever
got the keys.

1306
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,050
But you have a beanbag too,
so you throw that in.

1307
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:15,210
Whoever got closest would win money or 
something like that.

1308
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:16,740
But wow,
it's great fun.

1309
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:19,680
You know that my,
my ex wife took me on a balloon ride for

1310
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:22,380
my 40th birthday.
And on the way back I said,

1311
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:24,210
well,
how much do these things cost?

1312
00:54:24,211 --> 00:54:25,860
How did he get started in the next 
morning?

1313
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:27,690
I was taking lessons.
I had a lot of money.

1314
00:54:27,691 --> 00:54:29,280
Then.
How much does it cost to get a balloon?

1315
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:32,720
A balloon is about $35,000.
It wasn't back when I bought it.

1316
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:37,730
Yeah.
And how do you fold that bitch up once 

1317
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:37,940
you've done flying or they pack into a 
basket that's a.

1318
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:41,100
Oh maybe a third of the size of this 
table.

1319
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,310
Wow.
And,

1320
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,870
but then you have your basket too.
So you have a trailer behind your.

1321
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,980
Do you have a parachute up?
There ain't shit hits the fan will know 

1322
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,090
nothing.
No dude,

1323
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,480
I had balls.
I had one guy wanted to pay me to take 

1324
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:56,480
them up in a parachute,
but he wanted to jump out,

1325
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,280
but I didn't want to do it because once 
a,

1326
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:02,300
once a guy jumps out,
you get so much lighter and if you're 

1327
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:02,300
not careful,
you shoot up too fast.

1328
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,740
You collapse the envelope.
That doesn't happen very often,

1329
00:55:04,741 --> 00:55:06,720
but they're really safe.
Really safe.

1330
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:10,350
There are a lot of fun and wow,
that sounds scary.

1331
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,930
That you lower yourself.
Do you have to lower it?

1332
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,340
Naturally the.
There's a hole in the top and you have a

1333
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:20,130
line that goes through it and a rope.
Pull it and bleed air out of the top and

1334
00:55:20,131 --> 00:55:21,710
let it go.
And then when you're,

1335
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:26,740
when you're actually landing,
the top is held in by Velcro and so 

1336
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,950
except for the little flap that's open 
and when you're just very land,

1337
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:34,190
you rip that called pull the top out,
you pull the top out and then it will 

1338
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:34,190
deflate and land down.

1339
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:35,460
Sometimes your landings are a little 
rough.

1340
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:40,461
You know,
I've had landings are dragged for 50 

1341
00:55:40,461 --> 00:55:42,581
years.
One hundred yards were bounced up and 

1342
00:55:42,581 --> 00:55:45,561
down.
You know that the conditions sometimes 

1343
00:55:45,561 --> 00:55:45,561
make it tough.
And in,

1344
00:55:45,561 --> 00:55:47,310
in North Texas at the time you had to be
really,

1345
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,150
you know,
you can,

1346
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,280
you're allowed to land anywhere when 
you're landing,

1347
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,020
you know,
the Faa let you because you,

1348
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,850
if you,
if you out of fuel.

1349
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:58,950
And there was this one farm up in north 
Texas up by Cisco I think it was.

1350
00:55:58,951 --> 00:56:01,350
And,
and whenever the balloons would come and

1351
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:06,351
landing,
you can see dust coming on these gravel 

1352
00:56:06,351 --> 00:56:06,351
roads from two directions.
One would be this farmer with his pickup

1353
00:56:06,351 --> 00:56:11,301
and his shotgun and the other,
it'd be the sheriff to come to protect 

1354
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:11,301
you because the farmer,
hey,

1355
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,230
did you landing on their lawn when 
ballooning started?

1356
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:18,231
In France,
they would carry a bottle of champagne 

1357
00:56:18,231 --> 00:56:19,020
to give to the farmer when they landed 
as,

1358
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,340
hey,
thank you for letting us land here.

1359
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:25,340
Here's the champagne.
When ballooning started in the United 

1360
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,620
States,
the balloon has never gave it to the 

1361
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:28,620
landowners.
They drank it themselves,

1362
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:28,960
you know,
champagne and propane.

1363
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:31,000
Breakfast.
The balloon is how rude.

1364
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,690
That's why they ruined the whole thing.
Look at this.

1365
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,200
That looks like Albuquerque.
Yeah.

1366
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,510
There's one in Colorado too,
and Colorado Springs.

1367
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,760
We went to.
The woman that taught me the balloon,

1368
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,040
moved to Colorado Springs to.
Yeah,

1369
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:47,041
we went there to see it,
but there was bad weather so they'd 

1370
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:47,041
never launched it.
So you got to do it,

1371
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:51,750
you know,
at sunrise and sunset the a couple of 

1372
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,290
hours until after sunrise and a couple 
hours for sunset.

1373
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,300
That's the only time that the air is 
stable enough.

1374
00:56:55,301 --> 00:56:58,240
Have you ever met anybody that was up in
a balloon and saw a Ufo?

1375
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,850
No.
No.

1376
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:03,040
I mean it's too early in the day or plus
you're looking at other things.

1377
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:05,410
How convenient.
But what most people like to do on their

1378
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:08,380
first balloon ride is picked leaves from
the top of a tree.

1379
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,270
Wow.
For some reason that's a big thrill,

1380
00:57:10,271 --> 00:57:15,271
you know.
So we'd go and skim the trees and they 

1381
00:57:15,271 --> 00:57:15,271
can pick leaves.
Wow.

1382
00:57:15,271 --> 00:57:19,680
That's Weird Grief Fund.
It's weird that we figured out how to 

1383
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,220
float float around in the sky.
Yeah.

1384
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:26,330
You know,
it's just a matter of time before we 

1385
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:27,721
figured out how to do it with suits.
Some jet packs are coming around pretty 

1386
00:57:27,721 --> 00:57:31,510
good and well they've got guys that have
those wings suits that jump off cliffs.

1387
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:35,040
Psychopaths some nuts.
Oh,

1388
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,710
I can hardly watched those videos for me
to watch.

1389
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,660
And there's one word,
guy crashes.

1390
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:43,000
It's really hard to watch that one I 
haven't seen,

1391
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:48,180
but it's just a matter of time before 
they figure out something with like a 

1392
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,260
wing wings on that technology is going 
to grow.

1393
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,780
I think everything's going to grow,
you know?

1394
00:57:52,781 --> 00:57:54,610
I mean if they have a jet pack now and 
they.

1395
00:57:54,611 --> 00:57:55,380
Do,
you know,

1396
00:57:55,390 --> 00:58:00,390
I watched one when I was in Denver.
There was my friend willy has a Klg.

1397
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,380
What is it?
Kale,

1398
00:58:01,381 --> 00:58:02,750
PJ Klp,
j,

1399
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,470
the radio station had a guy come in 
that's a,

1400
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:09,130
a,
a that had a jet pack guy come in and he

1401
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:14,131
launched a jet pack in the parking lot 
and flew through the air for like 10 

1402
00:58:14,131 --> 00:58:16,981
seconds.
You can only do it for like 10 seconds 

1403
00:58:16,981 --> 00:58:19,380
and it was like within x amount of years
are going to be able to do five minutes 

1404
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:19,380
and then,
you know,

1405
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,760
x amount of years after that they think 
they're going to figure out some sort of

1406
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:26,440
power source that's going to be able to 
make it a viable mode of transportation.

1407
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:31,560
But it was very complicated as far as 
like the controlling the yard and what 

1408
00:58:31,751 --> 00:58:32,260
is it called?

1409
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:34,180
There's like to pitch,
pitch and Yaw.

1410
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,480
Yeah.
Apparently it's like it's not a simple 

1411
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,851
thing to figure out how to do.
We didn't have to learn that to get a 

1412
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,641
license for balloons because you know,
just up and down and he had literally 

1413
00:58:44,641 --> 00:58:47,770
have to learn whether cloud's a.
You had learned about procedures with 

1414
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:49,210
the FAA because you have to call the FAA
in the morning,

1415
00:58:49,211 --> 00:58:54,211
get a weather report and all.
And you tell them where you're going to 

1416
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:54,211
launch and so they'd know some balloons 
are going to be in the area.

1417
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:56,260
How much different is that than a blimp?
Can you,

1418
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:58,510
can you target a blimp?
I've never been in a blimp.

1419
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,520
But pilot one with your license.
Oh No,

1420
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:01,650
no.
It's lighter than air.

1421
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:05,260
Well maybe.
I don't know anybody crazy enough to let

1422
00:59:05,261 --> 00:59:07,420
me do it.
But I guess I guess that would be legal.

1423
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,670
It's lighter than aircraft.
Yeah.

1424
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,980
Do you have to renew that license or is 
that once you get it,

1425
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,840
you got it.
That's the crazy thing.

1426
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:16,690
You,
you don't ever have to renew it,

1427
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:22,020
but you have to have a check flight 
every year I think with somebody else 

1428
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:22,250
who's a commercial pilot.

1429
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,520
So all you have to do is get a friend,
go out and take a ride with you in your 

1430
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:27,520
current.
Again,

1431
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:27,650
I'm not current.
What was that?

1432
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:32,651
When you just put up Jamie got an 
address that flies and lady Gaga the 

1433
00:59:32,651 --> 00:59:34,310
actual lady Gaga,
like remote controlled.

1434
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,850
And uh oh.
So is it lady Gaga or is it a toy?

1435
00:59:37,851 --> 00:59:41,390
That's lady Gaga.
Lady Gaga is in a jet pack.

1436
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,260
Okay,
here she is.

1437
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:46,130
She's got a helmet on.
Let me see this.

1438
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:46,480
Well,
this is.

1439
00:59:46,481 --> 00:59:51,481
We just want us after it's over.
So she climbs into this fucking thing 

1440
00:59:51,481 --> 00:59:51,940
and flies around.

1441
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,100
I didn't think jetpacks could be 
annoying.

1442
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,860
Book is Lady Gaga and Jetpack Yeomans.
We ruin everything.

1443
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,410
This is so stupid.
She's connected by wires.

1444
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:08,210
Shut this off.
This is a fucking charade.

1445
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:10,130
Sunday really?
A jetpack.

1446
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,730
She's all wired up and everything like 
that.

1447
01:00:11,731 --> 01:00:13,160
It's more like a little helicopter.
Yeah,

1448
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:14,600
that's horse shit.
That's what that is.

1449
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:19,630
It's wired.
But you know there have been guys go 

1450
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:19,630
into the stadium football stadiums and 
those jet packs.

1451
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:20,930
Yeah.
Well there's that one guy that landed,

1452
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:26,200
he was in the middle of a boxing match.
Evander Holyfield was fighting Riddick 

1453
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,441
bowe and the guy landed.
He had like a parachute connected to 

1454
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:32,060
fans and he called himself like the fan.
I remember that.

1455
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:37,350
And they landed in delayed the fight for
like a half an hour while they had to 

1456
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:40,991
arrest this guy bringing police and they
beat the guy up and everything like 

1457
01:00:40,991 --> 01:00:41,270
that.
And then it sort of changed the,

1458
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:46,330
uh,
the atmosphere of the fight because 

1459
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:46,330
there was a big break and blow the 
fight.

1460
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:46,640
Anybody cool off and then had to go at 
it again.

1461
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,210
But that was,
I saw on,

1462
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:51,410
I used to walk on the bluffs down by del
Mar,

1463
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,440
which are maybe 30 feet or something.
And one day a guy came by and one of 

1464
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:56,440
those,
he's a parachute,

1465
01:00:56,450 --> 01:01:01,450
had a big fan on the back and,
and he was at eye level with me and he 

1466
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:01,450
said,
hello,

1467
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:03,590
hello.
And he's moving very slowly.

1468
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:09,010
Yeah.
This is the video riddick bowe and 

1469
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:09,010
evander holyfield fight and look,
they stop and they're like,

1470
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:12,290
what the hell?
And they're looking at is boom.

1471
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:17,291
The guy lands ringside in the crowd.
They should've turned hola holyfield 

1472
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:21,400
onto them.
Let them while they were in the middle 

1473
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,420
of,
he has other more important things to 

1474
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,901
do.
They just beat the shit out of this guy 

1475
01:01:25,901 --> 01:01:27,401
though.
I can see why you think that guys 

1476
01:01:27,401 --> 01:01:27,620
probably still in jail or I'm surprised 
they didn't just reschedule the fight.

1477
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,670
That's not really fair to do that as 
well.

1478
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,640
I think people wanted to conclusion 
yeah,

1479
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:36,670
it was all going on and all the money 
there in all the money on paper view as 

1480
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:36,790
well.
Poor fighters.

1481
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:38,570
So yeah.
You know what,

1482
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:40,850
they should have just started it up 
immediately.

1483
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:44,090
Shouldn't have waited a half an hour to 
give it a little five minute break,

1484
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:45,200
cut the cords,
just,

1485
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,400
let's do this.
But as I think it was a quite a,

1486
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:50,000
quite a break while they arrested this 
dummy,

1487
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,140
she needed pitch.
That's it.

1488
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:58,170
That's an example of a needy bitch.
So they should have those fights 

1489
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:58,170
indoors.
Yeah,

1490
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:01,250
I think they probably mostly do.
I very rarely hear about fights out.

1491
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:05,480
Do I know they do a few occasionally 
outside and Vegas is a big one,

1492
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:08,330
uh,
way back in Africa or something.

1493
01:02:08,331 --> 01:02:13,331
I can't remember.
The two Moitai ones they do do more 

1494
01:02:14,061 --> 01:02:16,400
time.
Ones in Vegas outside.

1495
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,190
Well didn't get quite

1496
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,630
as loud I think.
Yeah.

1497
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,740
But it's also your,
you're,

1498
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:27,750
the environment is different.
You're dealing with outside rain and 

1499
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:27,750
weird.
You know,

1500
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,360
I went to a,
um,

1501
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:31,690
a king of the cage.
Used to have these fights outside.

1502
01:02:31,691 --> 01:02:36,691
I went to a couple of them,
they used to have them in an Indian 

1503
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:39,130
casino in California back when mixed 
martial arts was illegal in California,

1504
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:42,760
so they would hold them in this outside 
casino and one time they uh,

1505
01:02:42,761 --> 01:02:45,490
it started raining,
it was pouring rain out and instead they

1506
01:02:45,491 --> 01:02:48,700
decided to let the fights continue in 
the pouring rain.

1507
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:51,150
So these people are fighting,
they're slipping,

1508
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:55,000
they try to throw kicks that fallen on 
their ass and people are climbing on top

1509
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:56,440
of that.
They're soaking wet.

1510
01:02:56,441 --> 01:02:59,230
It was the craziest and they released it
as a DVD,

1511
01:02:59,231 --> 01:03:01,420
I think it's called King of the cage,
wet and wild,

1512
01:03:01,421 --> 01:03:05,950
but it's a really insane series of 
fights where people were trying to fight

1513
01:03:05,951 --> 01:03:06,710
in a torrential

1514
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:11,040
rainstorm.
People just,

1515
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:16,160
just so nutty.
Did you ever hear of an old long time 

1516
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:16,160
ago wrestler name Gorgeous George?
Yes,

1517
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,040
sure.
I saw a gorgeous George Wrestle.

1518
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:22,720
My Dad took me to see them in the Elgin 
Highschool Gymnasium and the big deal,

1519
01:03:22,721 --> 01:03:24,160
he had long hair.
Well,

1520
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:26,080
it was maybe almost down to his 
shoulders,

1521
01:03:26,081 --> 01:03:28,990
but not quite,
but at that time I was huge in his.

1522
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,270
When he come out in the ring,
in the beginning,

1523
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,790
he,
his hair would be up and he'd take bobby

1524
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:36,160
pins out of his hair and throw them out 
to the audience.

1525
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,050
I was so disappointed.
I didn't catch you on.

1526
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:40,510
That's so funny.
Gorgeous.

1527
01:03:40,511 --> 01:03:45,511
George's George,
what's another thing that people would 

1528
01:03:45,511 --> 01:03:45,520
come if they came here from another 
planet?

1529
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:46,560
The biggest.
What the fuck is going on?

1530
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,200
Those guys are really hitting each other
like,

1531
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,890
why are you watching?
That was fun.

1532
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:54,300
We had to find out who's gonna win,
who's the champion of the world

1533
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,440
this week.
Yeah.

1534
01:03:56,770 --> 01:04:01,770
We were strange for strange floating 
around and balloons pretending to hit 

1535
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:02,730
each other.
Not Erase.

1536
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:04,230
Listen,
man.

1537
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:05,970
It's been a lot of fun.
It's been great.

1538
01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:10,050
Fun is enough.
Really glad to get to meet you.

1539
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,270
I don't think you realize what you're 
doing,

1540
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:17,271
but you are.
You're filling in a role here for a lot 

1541
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:19,650
of young people that you know.
You don't know how smart you are.

1542
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:20,970
Maybe you do,
but you're.

1543
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:26,030
You're extremely well read.
You know so much your time at Graham 

1544
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,090
Hancock about stuff.
I read the headlines and you know,

1545
01:04:27,091 --> 01:04:29,760
all these terms about the skull and 
stuff like that,

1546
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:32,470
but what you're doing is you're taking a
really,

1547
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,180
uh,
a high level intellectual product to the

1548
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:39,690
masses into especially young people that
maybe hadn't had the advantage.

1549
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:41,490
You go to college or something and they 
find out,

1550
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:43,110
hey,
they're as smart as anybody that went to

1551
01:04:43,111 --> 01:04:46,230
college and you're really doing a really
good service with these products.

1552
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,320
Well thank you.
But I'm not trying and I'm working.

1553
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:52,690
That's why it's working.
I'm extremely uneducated.

1554
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,340
You're very well read.
Well,

1555
01:04:54,341 --> 01:04:57,100
I read a lot of things but you know,
I mean what is education?

1556
01:04:57,101 --> 01:05:02,101
They are not reading but as far as like 
formal education and it is also as far 

1557
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:02,230
as like,
I don't know,

1558
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:07,290
I just liked what I like.
I'm interested in certain things and I 

1559
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:10,741
find that there's a lot of things out 
there that are fascinating that people 

1560
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:13,711
just aren't paying attention to.
And I think what would I see in what we 

1561
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:18,720
talk about on the podcast is really 
reflected by what I see on and when I 

1562
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,000
see on the Internet,
when I see,

1563
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:21,790
when I go to the various websites that I
visit for information,

1564
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:26,800
I see just a massive new upsurge and 
curiosity.

1565
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:30,280
I think the people were way more curious
than they ever have been before,

1566
01:05:30,281 --> 01:05:35,281
just by virtue of the fact they're 
getting more information than they've 

1567
01:05:35,281 --> 01:05:35,281
ever done.

1568
01:05:35,281 --> 01:05:35,281
They can get it,
you know,

1569
01:05:35,281 --> 01:05:36,490
they're not being held back.
So I think what this podcast is,

1570
01:05:36,491 --> 01:05:41,491
we came along in the right place at the 
right time and it was the right type of 

1571
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:43,090
person in me that kind of can bridge a 
few different worlds.

1572
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:48,091
Exactly that,
that's what you're bridging quite a few 

1573
01:05:48,091 --> 01:05:50,281
different worlds.
And that's really important in the 

1574
01:05:50,281 --> 01:05:52,140
potheads exactly.
When the bridge between the meat heads 

1575
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:52,140
and the beds were not all that 
different,

1576
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:52,930
you know,
we might look different,

1577
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,960
but there's,
there's prejudice against people who 

1578
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,040
engage in martial arts and exercise just
like this prejudice against people smoke

1579
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:01,630
pot.
And some of it's justified.

1580
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:02,670
And some of it's not.

1581
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:03,900
Yeah,
there's assholes in every.

1582
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,550
Absolutely.
It's so easy to define people because of

1583
01:06:08,551 --> 01:06:09,660
that,
you know,

1584
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:10,760
and I think that,
uh,

1585
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:16,040
in conversations like this and podcasts 
and it kind of gives everybody a better 

1586
01:06:16,351 --> 01:06:21,351
sense.
We're getting into people's heads 

1587
01:06:21,351 --> 01:06:21,351
because you're writing their ears,
you know,

1588
01:06:21,351 --> 01:06:25,641
they got the earphones on,
they're listening is theater of the 

1589
01:06:25,641 --> 01:06:25,641
mind,
you know,

1590
01:06:25,641 --> 01:06:25,641
and uh,
it's,

1591
01:06:25,641 --> 01:06:26,210
it's,
uh,

1592
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:29,650
the old voice in the back of the mind 
that you hear that,

1593
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:34,890
you know,
I've heard so many of your podcasts 

1594
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:34,890
that,
you know,

1595
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:34,890
I feel like I've known you all my life.

1596
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,920
I feel I've known you a long time to.
I've listened to you on many road trips,

1597
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:40,400
give the introductions to all these 
different various psychedelic talks.

1598
01:06:40,401 --> 01:06:41,510
How many episodes do you have?

1599
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:44,080
Uh,
I just last night did three 78.

1600
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,550
Wow.

1601
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,570
You are on episode four.
Nineteen.

1602
01:06:47,571 --> 01:06:52,571
You almost ran for 20.
We were going to do a special for 20 

1603
01:06:52,571 --> 01:06:53,120
episode,
but now I'm like,

1604
01:06:53,121 --> 01:06:54,380
what?
That's so stupid.

1605
01:06:54,381 --> 01:06:57,200
I'm so tired of that hole.
For 20 thing.

1606
01:06:57,201 --> 01:06:59,020
It's just like,
what?

1607
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,310
This is a number,
the podcasts or the pot,

1608
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:06,330
I mean we,
and I'm kind of hypocritical because we 

1609
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:07,070
always like make a big deal of it each 
100 that we hit,

1610
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:11,920
but for 20 to seem stupid it seems like 
a tired thing for Tony.

1611
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:13,700
Like come on,

1612
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:17,750
I'm thinking about for 400 what I've 
been working on it.

1613
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:19,730
It's not too far along yet,
but I've,

1614
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:22,430
I've cut out little sound of Mckenna,
you know,

1615
01:07:22,431 --> 01:07:27,431
30 to 62nd soundbites and I have about 
100 of them from a 100 different talks 

1616
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:33,180
he gave and I'm going to try to spring 
string them together and cut up and try 

1617
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:36,140
to make it a single cohesive type thing.
Hasn't been working too well yet,

1618
01:07:36,141 --> 01:07:41,141
but uh,
it's worth a try and he has one of the 

1619
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:41,240
cool things that you do do that's kind 
of scary and dangerous and sacrilegious.

1620
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:43,990
You Edit Mckenna speeches.
Get a lot of grief.

1621
01:07:43,991 --> 01:07:48,991
A fucking freak.
And why'd you cut out the stuff about 

1622
01:07:48,991 --> 01:07:48,991
the stoned ape theory?
Well,

1623
01:07:48,991 --> 01:07:49,440
because it's the 80th time.
You heard it.

1624
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:51,040
You know,
I'm not a historian.

1625
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:56,041
My job is to get the carnival barker and
all of the masters copies are going to 

1626
01:07:56,741 --> 01:08:01,741
Arrow,
would have all the masters and then the 

1627
01:08:01,741 --> 01:08:01,741
real master tapes and all are going to 
go back to offend Mckenna.

1628
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:03,160
Beautiful.
So that's awesome.

1629
01:08:03,161 --> 01:08:04,690
Yeah,
they're out there now.

1630
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,010
They're out there.
You can get a hold of them.

1631
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:11,070
Now.
I've got about another hundred Mckenna 

1632
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:11,070
talks.
Nobody's heard yet.

1633
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:11,070
Including me.
Hundred.

1634
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:12,130
Yeah.
Oh my God.

1635
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,260
Wow.
So I'm.

1636
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:18,320
I'm good for another year or so.
And plus we were doing the plank and rj 

1637
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,550
talks at burning man that gets.
We had another 30 or 40 every year.

1638
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,640
Wow.
You change your name because of burning 

1639
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:24,640
man.
Yeah.

1640
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,160
Well that's when you know you get too 
high when you change it.

1641
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,690
My friend rob did that.
He used to be.

1642
01:08:29,691 --> 01:08:32,620
Chris became.
I've been working up to it and,

1643
01:08:32,621 --> 01:08:37,621
and my,
my sister in law who died had called me 

1644
01:08:37,621 --> 01:08:37,621
Lorenzo all the time.
So it was a family name and,

1645
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:41,540
and at burning man,
this damn parrot crime's up on my arm.

1646
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:42,770
And I said,
what's that Paris name?

1647
01:08:42,771 --> 01:08:43,640
He says,
Lorenzo.

1648
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:44,120
And I said,
oh,

1649
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:46,130
that's my name too.
And that was the day I changed it.

1650
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:47,250
Wow,
that's hilarious.

1651
01:08:47,251 --> 01:08:48,800
That's really hard for my wife and 
family.

1652
01:08:48,801 --> 01:08:50,330
But they finally got there.

1653
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:56,900

1657
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,460
Yeah,

1658
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:08,620
I can't afford it.

1662
01:09:19,431 --> 01:09:22,610

1663
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:25,520

1671
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,890
Beautiful all on on kindle.
Thank you sir.

1672
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:54,190
I appreciate it.
It's been an honor to be an artist for 

1673
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:54,260
me as well.
It's really cool and I think both of our

1674
01:09:54,261 --> 01:09:57,160
audiences to cross a lot and so I'm glad
they both got to hear it.

1675
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:58,120
Absolutely,
and I,

1676
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:03,190
like I said,
I think that's how I heard about you in 

1677
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:03,190
the first place.
I'm pretty sure.

1678
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:06,011
So I've got a lot of people in my 
audience say the first time they heard 

1679
01:10:06,011 --> 01:10:06,080
about me was from you,
so it goes around,

1680
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:07,430
comes around,
and indeed it does.

1681
01:10:07,431 --> 01:10:08,480
Thank you sir.
You're welcome.
