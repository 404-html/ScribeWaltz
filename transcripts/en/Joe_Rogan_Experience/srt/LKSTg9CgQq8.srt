1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Fight it.
We'll do it live well to alive.

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,370
Fuck it.
We'll do it live.

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,480
Dad will go down in history as one of 
the all time,

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:18,770
like hissy fit remixes too.
Did you ever see the bill o'reilly Remix

5
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:20,950
a dance remix?
I was.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,760
I was amazed by that.
With bill o'reilly were he was going.

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,890
No,
don't.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,620
They're gone.
Yeah,

9
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:25,880
we're gonna.
That's what we're going to do.

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,920
I don't know what that means to play us 
out.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,970
I'm like,
how do you know what it means to play a 

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:32,970
so angry?
So angry?

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:32,970
Yeah.
He's an angry man.

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,280
What?
What we were talking before the podcast 

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,940
started about some the.
No,

16
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:39,210
no,
no,

17
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:39,580
no,
no.

18
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,020
I'm talking about.
That's insider information.

19
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,540
Being at Fox for years.
I can't,

20
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,980
but I'll let her go,
but can you can talk about moby though 

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,440
right here we can talk about Mobi.
Mobi says he has like inside information

22
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:53,990
about Donald Trump that he knows that 
Donald Trump talked to the Russians.

23
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:59,050
First of all,
when you look at Mobi with his fucking 

24
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,451
Hashtag Vegan tee shirt on,
do you really think anybody in the 

25
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:02,320
Russian fucking intelligence communities
talking to moby?

26
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,360
Actually,
it would be a brilliant ploy from the 

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,831
Russians.
They just give a little info to moby 

28
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:08,831
like you go.
You tell them and he's going to do it,

29
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:12,360
you know,
you definitely leaked decent formation.

30
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,860
Wouldn't be the downfall.
Then they found out he wasn't Enya and 

31
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:17,860
they'd made a mistake.
He,

32
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,230
um,
he,

33
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,260
my mom was a wardrobe style,
so costume designer for a show called 

34
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,980
[inaudible].
It's like the French Canadian sort of 

35
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,641
Letterman,
like Kinda like Graham Norton in 

36
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:29,111
England,
so they'd have stars coming all the 

37
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:29,111
time.
And moby was there.

38
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:31,990
He was just a headcase.
The guy was just absolutely out of his 

39
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,381
mind.
Nothing was good enough and you would 

40
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:35,381
want something and then say he wanted to
change it.

41
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:36,740
Like what kind of things did he want to 
change?

42
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:38,150
I don't know.
I can tell you this.

43
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,320
There were only two people who made my 
mom like,

44
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,850
come home crying.
One was Brett Butler and uh,

45
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,060
she just thought live from grace under 
fire was all pilled out of her head in 

46
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,390
the nineties when she was crying to my 
mom.

47
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:54,790
She was the wardrobe person you might 
have,

48
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:59,791
even if you did one of the gallows and 
never did the gallows because I wanted 

49
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:00,800
me to work clean.
Did they put you in the nasty shell?

50
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,920
So it was always on the advertising and 
I was on my own shows.

51
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:05,760
After awhile I would do my own shows.
But the,

52
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,650
uh,
the Gallo,

53
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:07,930
they were always like,
you have to be cleaned.

54
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:09,650
I'm like,
not interested.

55
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,690
Yeah,
I understand being cleaned for Canadian 

56
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:14,690
TV for no money.
Thanks though with that flip side is the

57
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,020
nasty show.

58
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,580
Like just don't market it that way.
Just make,

59
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,360
make the show and everyone coming like 
I'm going into the nasty shit.

60
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,330
Yeah.
But they liked it.

61
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,750
That was,
they would go to see it and it would be 

62
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,750
like the way that the festival would 
sort of differentiate.

63
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,150
I Dunno,
I dunno not the worst name for a show.

64
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,460
I guess.
It just seems like it just seems like,

65
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,720
like they're little kids in the school 
year,

66
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,650
like he said,
a bad word.

67
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:36,060
Like we know Comedians,
you know it's going to be a ra show,

68
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,110
dirty,
nasty.

69
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,230
Speaking to nasty.
We are gentlemen today and we have 

70
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:44,230
pipes.
Oh yeah,

71
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,740
because crowder had a crowder by the 
way,

72
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:46,460
I don't think.
No,

73
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,550
I don't ever do that.
We just started talking.

74
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,220
Steven crowder,
who's from louder with crowder is 

75
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,580
Internet show and he has a thing on his 
internet show where you have like a 

76
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:57,890
little pipe.

77
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,220
What would you it like a trolley would 
you call the trials to pipe crack pipe 

78
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,220
rack.
Okay.

79
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,090
I wanted to come up with a better name 
than the name.

80
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,780
So you went to Mr Rogers' neighborhood 
right away.

81
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,290
I saw it.
I said I always wanted to smoke a pipe 

82
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,721
man.
I just think they smell good to know 

83
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:16,270
that that's actually for my,
my brother out there.

84
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:17,990
That's called a seer sucker.
You.

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,410
So your brother is a serious pike?
He knows more than I do.

86
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,990
So this isn't like a seersucker the type
of suit.

87
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:28,991
I know that's what they call it.
Let's say they called this all kinds of 

88
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:29,780
weird names like lane one.
Q is really common is actually really.

89
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,590
It smells really nice and interesting 
English blends,

90
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,000
which he smokes.
That's we don't want to do.

91
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,640
Then I was super heavy nicotine,
but a lot of Kia.

92
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,110
You get some perico.
Very smoky,

93
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:43,111
like instancy barbecue.
We have some done killed dunhill night 

94
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:43,380
camp,
which it'll.

95
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,370
It'll put you to sleep.
So how much do you put in?

96
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,920
So sorry I.
People Are Thinking yes,

97
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:48,210
no,
here.

98
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Here's the rule.
So we're gotta do is put it up to the 

99
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,240
brim,
up to the brand.

100
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Just kind of the brand.
Pack it in there.

101
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,240
No,
no,

102
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,870
don't pack it in yet.
The general rule is the first one.

103
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:58,330
You Tamp it down with your finger.
The strength of a child.

104
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,420
Then you fill it again,
the strength of a woman and you fill it 

105
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,420
a third time with the strength of a man.
Okay,

106
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,930
so fill it just barely now.
Then more strength of a woman.

107
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,070
Well,
what kind of a woman man?

108
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:10,130
Like a Chris Cyborg?
No,

109
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,160
not like a cyber.
Let's not talk about that because that 

110
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,160
can go sideways and this show.

111
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,150
Okay,
well it's already gone sideways.

112
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,580
The fact that I said her name,
she's like,

113
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:21,610
candy man,
I'm going to have a job than a man.

114
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,350
Kind of a man.
Like a Mobi.

115
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,720
Men are like me.
I'm,

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,880
I'm saying,
well not get jared.

117
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:29,290
Just his arm wrestling.
Courtney,

118
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,350
who's like super crossfit extraordinary 
this week.

119
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,990
She's really strong.
She likes go onto 65.

120
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,190
Whoa,
that's a lot.

121
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,900
But I think he's gonna smoke on the 
armrest thing.

122
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:39,510
So this is the think that.
Well,

123
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,260
people can tune in and watch.
I think he's a man.

124
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,070
So he texted me right away.
Well she thinks he's going to win too.

125
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,080
Wow,
I bet the bet is like 74.

126
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,650
Yeah.
So you tamp that down.

127
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:49,780
Tamp it.
Like what?

128
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:51,730
You want us to be a little springy.
Okay,

129
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,750
I got a little spring you there?
Yeah.

130
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,820
Little springy running on moss perhaps.

131
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,480
Yes.
Yes.

132
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:56,750
Exactly.
Okay.

133
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,790
And then,
uh,

134
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,710
I didn't.
You got to file.

135
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,720
I do too.
So when you do is you light it once and 

136
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:04,720
that's what we call the charring light.
So we're going to do is you're gonna see

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,190
that already turned me off by the way.
Only tobacco in that pipe or it'll ruin 

138
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:12,110
the briar.
Let's meet me if I closed.

139
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,300
We eat in there.
It'll fuck it up.

140
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,340
Will you won't be able to taste the 
tobacco from there forward.

141
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Yeah.
Because it'll taste like something so 

142
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,000
around in a circle.
And I do not want you to do it.

143
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,230
Gosh.
And then,

144
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:28,231
uh,
you're gonna see that tobacco kind of 

145
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:28,231
raise up.
So puff it.

146
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:28,231
Keep puffing on it.
Yeah.

147
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,570
And then you tamp it down one more time.
Once it goes out and then you light it 

148
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:34,750
again.
Okay.

149
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,670
So super involved.

150
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,590
I know it is.
It's,

151
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,810
it's not one thing.
It's not something you just kind of 

152
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:42,810
lightened go and it won't last long.
Hold on.

153
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,210
Immediate head rush by the way.
Really?

154
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,490
Oh by the way,
don't inhale it.

155
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:48,490
Just puff it too late.
Well,

156
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,930
about bots.
Bowker broke.

157
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,390
Well you don't want hail that.
There's no filter on that.

158
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,400
What are your busby?
What I'm saying,

159
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:56,710
that's like you'll get actual chunks of 
tobacco in your lungs.

160
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,400
There's no,
that's a big,

161
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,690
big.
Maybe you will.

162
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,310
Not me,
bro.

163
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,720
Probably.
You touched some matches over.

164
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:04,790
Hear you bro.
But smell that smell nice.

165
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,010
I got an a on it now.
Um,

166
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,740
do I use a lighter?
Can I use the lighter?

167
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,430
As long as it's not a jet lighter 
because that'll damage the briar.

168
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,430
So like I said,
it's not A.

169
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,100
I like it.
I feel like a,

170
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,600
a distinguished gentlemen,
like who's at a Nigel Farrage.

171
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,830
No,
no.

172
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:30,600
He's not distinguished.
He's an asshole,

173
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:35,601
but he's a lot of fun.
It was fun to listen to them talk to 

174
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:36,540
people.
I love when you guys had that thing,

175
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,210
when he a thug life,
the thug life thing.

176
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,100
It was hilarious on your own.
Not Gay.

177
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,430
Jarrod came over and gave you a lap 
dance and getting silly.

178
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,640
Yeah.
We got word that night or liked that 

179
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:49,640
show.
I don't know how true it is,

180
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:49,640
but.
Well,

181
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,110
you guys are one of the very few.
I mean you're a conservative guy,

182
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:55,860
but I would say you get a bad rap dude.
You really do.

183
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,730
That's one of the reasons why I like you
is because you are.

184
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,780
You're a pretty much fact oriented guy 
when it comes to a lot of issues,

185
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,810
political issues,
social issues.

186
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,500
You don't bullshit and you don't.
You don't like try to sway things toward

187
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:15,960
one side or the other when it's not 
accurate.

188
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,120
Well,
I appreciate that and by the way these,

189
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,350
you know,
these probably will go out.

190
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,420
You have to relight it because it's just
kind of an art.

191
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:26,421
So I've had people talk to me about you 
and they give me this bullshit take on 

192
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:28,800
you and I know he's a smart guy.
I go,

193
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:29,730
he's just.
Yeah,

194
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:31,980
he's conservative.
So yeah,

195
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:36,981
I know a lot of people that are liberal 
to a lot of people that are in the 

196
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:39,981
middle.
What you can't talk to someone because 

197
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:39,981
they appreciate that and that's to,
not to kiss him,

198
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:44,540
but people out there that need to know 
that Joe has been incredibly fair and 

199
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:44,720
very kind behind the scenes you have 
like because there do,

200
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:47,070
you have every reason not to and I think
a big reason of it honestly.

201
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,410
Yeah.
Here's a good example,

202
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,420
the young Turks,
and we've seen this transition with 

203
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,030
trump or people who were really afraid 
to speak out.

204
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:59,031
Now you're seeing that change online 
because the establishment has been 

205
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:02,991
Barack Obama,
so kids who were raised for eight years 

206
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:02,991
under Bushmen,
eight Bush,

207
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:02,991
you know,
listen to no effects,

208
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:04,110
go to the vans warped tour,
whatever it is,

209
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,410
and now they've been raised under Obama 
for eight years and all this political 

210
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:09,410
correctness run amok and they're 
rejecting that.

211
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:14,180
So for the longest time I had this small
youtube channel and I was on Fox so it 

212
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,140
was kind of muddled a little bit because
I was there and there were certain 

213
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,111
things that I could say or couldn't say 
online because it was a liability young 

214
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:21,750
issue at the time as well as to take you
seriously.

215
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,860
That's 21 years old.
Yeah.

216
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:25,420
He a little fresh faced little lad now.

217
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,300
You're not even that old now holding 
that 29.

218
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,030
You're a young fellow.
Well,

219
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,410
um,
and so what happened is they kind of had

220
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,380
their interpretation from whenever the 
young Turks said about me because when I

221
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:37,290
had 50,000
subscribers it was like their day job to

222
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:42,291
go after me and now when I've had Alex 
Jones and we'd been doing proactive 

223
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,950
parodies of the young Turks,
call them out asthma debate,

224
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,640
they will trash talk every conservative,
not named Steven crowder.

225
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:50,850
It's like I'm Voldemort,
my name won't be spoken when at 50,000

226
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:53,640
subscribers they would talk about me all
the time and they had,

227
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:54,900
you know,
a million or 2 million.

228
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Now that's changed and people were able 
to come here directly and only that you 

229
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,260
will give me your lighter.
The matches are getting annoying.

230
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,190
Yeah.
Thank you.

231
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,600
So,
um,

232
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,350
I,
you know,

233
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:05,130
I like to think,
but you know,

234
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:10,131
there's also the real possibility that 
people just don't like me because I'm 

235
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:10,131
kind of a Dick.

236
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:10,980
Well,
you can be a dick sometimes,

237
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,730
but you're a funny Dick.
Like you do some funny shit.

238
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,000
Like one of the things that you did that
was really funny was a will.

239
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:21,390
What was that feminist rally thing that 
you went to?

240
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,670
The recent one where?
The tranny.

241
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,740
Yeah,
and I actually interviewed Wendy Davis.

242
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,060
I don't think you're supposed to as a 
trainee,

243
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:28,080
Bro.
Yeah,

244
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:28,560
I don't really.
Well,

245
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:30,000
so that's why people don't like me 
sometimes,

246
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,060
but I think now you're seeing more 
people say that they don't care.

247
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,220
I think it's funny when they start 
making words taboo,

248
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:40,221
I really do like people said tranny 
forever and then all of a sudden it's 

249
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:40,350
like disparaging like,
okay,

250
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,160
I haven't noticed in the new build burst
special.

251
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:43,000
He said like,
Oh,

252
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,010
what are you going to deal?
You'll fucking Mary.

253
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,720
And I said,
I was like,

254
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,750
he would've said fag four years ago 
because he did in his special and used 

255
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,860
the word Mary talking about like a sissy
hasn't.

256
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,860
Like that's not a.
that's not a word we ever heard him use 

257
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:56,860
before.
Oh,

258
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:56,860
Bill uses that word.
Duh.

259
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,810
Yeah,
that's a Boston word.

260
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,280
Yeah.
You fucking marry people called guys 

261
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,280
Mary's.
Well,

262
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,400
he's probably.
Maybe he's trying to be a little bit 

263
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,400
more politically correct.
You know what I do?

264
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,060
I use the word,
but I do it in character.

265
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,220
Yeah,
because if I say like Faggot,

266
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,740
like,
well,

267
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,210
I didn't say it.
Nigel said it.

268
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,240
That was not me.
I had this joke about tigers in Texas 

269
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,240
because I don't know if you know my,
my,

270
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,420
uh,
this is a true story from my last,

271
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,470
a Netflix special.
There are more tigers in captivity in 

272
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,261
Texas than there are in all of the wild,
the world in private collections,

273
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,370
in people's backyards.
There are more tigers in Texas than the 

274
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,800
rest of the fucking planet earth.
That is a fact.

275
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,260
That is a real step because they can 
have them.

276
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,330
Just a bunch of dentists who carried him
back just because I know people that 

277
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,371
know people that have tigers.
I know people in Texas who's friends 

278
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:49,371
have tigers.
It just,

279
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:50,700
you can have a title.
Are you aware?

280
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,440
By the way,
what's the biggest category?

281
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,550
You probably know this,
but the biggest,

282
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,980
a predatory cat.
Do you know what it ligers,

283
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,660
but it's not.
They're not viable.

284
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,710
They can't breathe.
Well,

285
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,770
I thought the lion at first tiger with 
so much bigger back in the Roman Roman 

286
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,060
times and the coliseum.
This is what,

287
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,350
and I can't entirely corroborate this,
I will say this,

288
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,470
corroborate it.
When you do the lions,

289
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,480
the lions have to be on three points and
can Paul,

290
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,270
where's the Siberian tigers would 
leverage back in pounds.

291
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,340
Yeah.
Said it wasn't even close.

292
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:22,410
Not to mention that the tigers are way 
bigger,

293
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,810
but they were able to just go back on 
their two legs,

294
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:27,210
whereas the lion has to have three 
points of contact,

295
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:28,710
which is like a dog given the POC.

296
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

297
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,900
So when I saw him I was like,
well that's,

298
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,330
that's something that's pretty 
incredible because you see a lion.

299
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:33,980
I mean,
you know,

300
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:38,981
you're,
I saw the ghost in the darkness and 

301
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:38,981
that's pretty,
pretty scary.

302
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:41,360
Well,
it's not even close to mountain lion 

303
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,360
will fuck you up dude.
Like just a small mountain line.

304
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,900
That 80 pound mountain lion fuck you up.
But a Siberian tiger will fuck you up in

305
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:47,820
ways you couldn't possibly imagine.
Well,

306
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:50,070
I have a dog hopper,
Dogo Argentino.

307
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,270
Oh,
those are big dogs.

308
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,220
Well you can google it too.
They're not.

309
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,260
They are not trained them good.
But their sketch.

310
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Well he is.
He ran for president with Dean Cain and 

311
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,361
he had like a few hundred votes,
which I felt bad about cause it was a 

312
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:05,761
gag.
So who knows if that changed the state 

313
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:05,761
of Michigan.
But by the way,

314
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:06,670
if it starts going out,
you put two fingers over,

315
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:09,210
kind of create a slipstream and suck it 
in and I'll give you.

316
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,810
Probably not now.
You probably need to relate it.

317
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,180
It's not like a cigar.
It's not good to talk and smoke a pipe.

318
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:18,181
It's meant to be more contemplated.
But Bertrand Russell used to smoke a 

319
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:18,181
pipe.
Trinity,

320
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:20,980
I don't know if you did it.
Are you doing the voice,

321
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,020
the voice to speak and it was a one.
It was one of the things like he wanted 

322
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:32,251
to fly and he would only fly if he could
smoke on the plane because he was so 

323
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,060
addicted to tobacco that he had to 
constantly smoke.

324
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:35,020
There he is.
Look at him,

325
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,140
look at him smoking a pipe or a pipe.
That's how he would speak,

326
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,280
but it is,
um,

327
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,900
it is very relaxing because it's kind of
like Jujitsu.

328
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,920
You said you've used the term moving 
meditation when you're sitting down 

329
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:49,920
there outside.
At the end of the day,

330
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,850
if you don't focus on it,
it's going to go out.

331
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,290
It's not like a cigar.
It's not like a cigarette.

332
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,330
So you have to sit there and focus on 
the draw,

333
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,570
focus on the exhale.
And all you're thinking about is,

334
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,520
is the pipe.
So it really is kind of a contemplate of

335
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:01,420
art.
No,

336
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,700
you're getting fucked up on tobacco.
Why you lying?

337
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,490
You're lying to people.
Um,

338
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,220
what were we talking about before?
That was tigers in Texas.

339
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,580
There's more time to bring her in May.
Dude.

340
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:17,581
You're going all over the place.
Run a youtube search on Doug Argentino 

341
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:18,210
mountain lions.
You will see doug.

342
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,500
Argentina was messing up actual mountain
lions.

343
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,400
Yeah.
You know why?

344
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,720
Because the mountain lion wants to get 
away.

345
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,640
It's probably true.
The amount of mine doesn't want to fight

346
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,770
to the death.
The mountain lion is a predatory animal.

347
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:28,780
Predatory animals don't necessarily 
fight to the death.

348
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:33,781
It's one of the reasons why dogs are so 
fucking dangerous because dogs are bred 

349
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:34,360
to not feel pain,
not recognize me.

350
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,920
That's one of the things about pit 
bulls.

351
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,570
They're not the biggest,
strongest dogs,

352
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,820
but they're bred to ignore pain and 
that,

353
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:44,821
that,
that drive to attack and ignore pain 

354
00:13:44,821 --> 00:13:46,360
makes some very problematic.
Just you just used the word problematic.

355
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:51,361
Let's,
let's span that word a little bit and 

356
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:51,910
use an anecdote.
Smoking a pipe.

357
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,620
But uh,
yeah,

358
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,060
they are,
that's what they're bred for.

359
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:57,820
They're actually really people oriented 
because they're bred to be protective of

360
00:13:57,821 --> 00:14:00,370
people in hunt with people,
so they're not bred to fight dogs.

361
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,600
So a lot of actually people there was,
that's where we got robberies or rescue 

362
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:05,920
out in,
in Michigan.

363
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,620
Um,
a lot of guys in the inner cities bought

364
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:10,000
them thinking this is like a bigger pit 
bull.

365
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:15,001
They're going to be great dog fighters.
They were horrible and they just got 

366
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:15,550
abandoned.
So there's all kinds of dog out there in

367
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,150
western Michigan.

368
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,150
I Dunno if there still are.
I'm wild dogs will just,

369
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,000
our dog howl.
I look cute.

370
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,460
That looks very much like guard dog or a
cute photo.

371
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:26,320
They're so big.
Such a big dog.

372
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,700
Ours,
a little bit of a runt.

373
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,460
He's about 90 pounds because he,
um,

374
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,620
we found him with a broken leg roaming 
the streets.

375
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,090
Alopecia,
lyme disease.

376
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,400
So you rescue them right off the street?
Well,

377
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:41,401
no,
he was rescued into a lady who 

378
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:42,600
specialized in Dagos and then we took 
them from her and uh,

379
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,670
he's the most people oriented dog we've 
ever seen.

380
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,110
I mean,
to the point where he'll actually,

381
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:49,780
the biggest problem you have is if you 
stop petting him and you don't know him,

382
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,920
he'll growl free to keep petting him.
So kids and they're terrified her.

383
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,230
Well that seems like a Dickie dog.
Yeah,

384
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,620
a little bit.
I have a dog called a regency massive.

385
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,880
Oh yeah.
Those are no joke.

386
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,000
It's a neapolitan is bread with a pit 
bull.

387
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:08,330
So there are about 140 pounds to get 
with the athletes is great.

388
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,820
My kids ride him,
like literally ride them,

389
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,980
they get on top of him and he'll just 
watch it again.

390
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,990
Pita on you for that.
Now these shouldn't be writing because 

391
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:17,990
he's older now.
Poor,

392
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,050
poor fella.
He's like 11.

393
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,330
He's got some hip problems.
Susan walks with a limp.

394
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,790
Well,
thank you for having me back.

395
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,590
Even though part of your audience 
doesn't like it,

396
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,830
but don't be defensive.
Don't say that.

397
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,730
Have you noticed a change,
a kind of a new sort of trump?

398
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,050
Well,
culturally I think there's.

399
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,030
I know this is sound sounds like a 
broken record,

400
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:40,031
but counterculture why's he have a lot 
of people who were afraid to even speak 

401
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,901
up.
Even from the last time I was on the 

402
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:43,901
show where they've been called racist,
sexist,

403
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:44,840
homophobic,
transphobic is a new thing we're in.

404
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,390
Was going.
You know what,

405
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:45,950
alright,
fine.

406
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:48,380
Let's go with that.
I think if you were to hold the election

407
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,870
today,
Donald trump would win in a landslide.

408
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,300
Wouldn't even be close.
Just because.

409
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,680
Yeah.
That's because of how bad the behavior 

410
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:57,680
has been from the left.
All the rest of America.

411
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,080
I had my uber driver coming here and she
believed every lie.

412
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:01,710
Her name.
She was a Latino.

413
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,280
Why ever talked to Uber Drivers about 
politics?

414
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:09,281
It always seems to end in a TMZ value.
Explain why I have a four point two 

415
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:12,461
rating.
So I'm right at the threshold of losing 

416
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:12,461
my uber privileges.
Are you serious?

417
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,790
So like you get a rating as a customer.
Yeah.

418
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,760
You get to rating as a customer.
What's a good rating?

419
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:18,290
A 10.
You have a four point two?

420
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,490
No,
no,

421
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:19,020
no,
it's fine.

422
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,970
It's at a five.
Oh,

423
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:20,870
that's not that bad.

424
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,860
No,
it's not that bad.

425
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:24,050
But if you go,
you're out.

426
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,190
You're out.
So you go like someone could find you 

427
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,201
right now.
Uber drivers could be like unite and 

428
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:32,201
blackball you.
They could.

429
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:32,201
Well my friend,
uh,

430
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,170
I can't say his name because it's 
illegal.

431
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:38,171
Actually had his concealed carry with 
them in an Uber and he forgot his 

432
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:38,750
magazine and that person rated him like 
a one.

433
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,960
So it took one bad rating,
a drop his score because he had to call 

434
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:43,960
them,
say,

435
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:43,960
hey,
um,

436
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,070
I think I forgot something in the back 
of your car.

437
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,430
I'm like,
what is it?

438
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,340
Like a magazine?
It was like,

439
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,540
Oh,
like a people magazine.

440
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,830
And she's like,
no,

441
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:56,831
just look.
And the guy was just on the phone with 

442
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:56,831
them saying,
what did you do in my car?

443
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,830
And he just said I was going to the 
range.

444
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,240
He wasn't,
he carries a gun and I'm everywhere.

445
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,470
It's everywhere he goes.
But,

446
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:01,430
um,
this lady,

447
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,880
Uber La,
she decided to start talking about it,

448
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,170
talking about the women's March and 
stuff.

449
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:08,060
So I just,
it's hard for me to say nothing,

450
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,670
but we ended up on very good terms,
but there's a different story.

451
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,530
This is not the message,
not the magazine story.

452
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,510
And she on drugs right now and the speed
or anything on new drugs.

453
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,350
It's very quick.
Everything's going quick.

454
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,940
Well,
I settled into the show.

455
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:20,300
I'm not.
Well,

456
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:24,440
I had that nitro coffee and I came from 
coffee bean and tea leaf right already.

457
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,950
That is 270 milligrams caffeine.
So I've probably got about five,

458
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:32,951
600 milligrams.
So that's two grand day starbucks 

459
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:32,951
coffees.
Seriously,

460
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,790
I think there's kind of the middle of 
that 200.

461
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,190
Yeah.
It's closing,

462
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,260
closing in on two Grande's.
Um,

463
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,130
but she said,
she's like,

464
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,900
well,
Donald Trump called all Mexicans.

465
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,340
Rapists said,
no,

466
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,680
she was Donald Trump is gonna ruin gay 
rights.

467
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,340
People want what?
Because it's because it's just in my 

468
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,340
nature,
and I said,

469
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,340
well,
why?

470
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,561
She goes,
because Donald trump removed the gay 

471
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:54,561
rights thing on the website as well.
What about the fact that all presidents,

472
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:57,900
they remove everything from the previous
administration and they put up new,

473
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,540
a whole new whitehouse.gov
website and these people,

474
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,880
they buy it in La.
They're in such an insular bubble.

475
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:07,881
I don't think they realize that there's 
a whole bunch of people who voted for 

476
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:08,370
Donald trump and I wasn't a fan of him 
in the primaries,

477
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:10,320
but they didn't vote for him because 
they're racist.

478
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,560
They didn't vote for him because I don't
want Caitlyn Jenner to take a dump at 

479
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,081
trump towers.
They didn't vote for him because they 

480
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:18,081
hate brown people.
They voted for him because they're tired

481
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:23,061
of being called all those things and 
that's why I think you see a lot of 

482
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:23,820
these young people who just kind of want
to be instigators and provoca tours,

483
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,270
but at the same time they're 
appreciating more traditionalism and 

484
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,051
some of the values that our parents 
tried to instill in them because that's 

485
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:33,510
kind of more rebellious and going along 
with the entertainment industry.

486
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,510
Well,
there's always this sort of longing for 

487
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,120
nostalgia that people exhibit.
There's always like back in the good old

488
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:44,121
days,
like back in the good old days is 

489
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:45,771
bullshit because the good old days you 
died of syphilis and the good old days 

490
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:48,360
people got fucking plague from rats.
There was no good old days.

491
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,480
This is the good old days right now.
So there's always that.

492
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,550
There's always this longing for 
nostalgia,

493
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,580
but I think.
I think you're right with some people,

494
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,740
but for sure there's some people that 
are racist.

495
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:00,990
There voted for Donald trump just 
because some people are racist.

496
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,650
Sure,
yeah,

497
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:03,210
of course.
But to try and paint,

498
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:08,211
I mean if you look at the numbers,
a huge percentage of people who voted 

499
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:08,211
for Barack Obama had to have voted for 
Donald Trump,

500
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:09,810
particularly in Michigan and 
Pennsylvania.

501
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,750
There just aren't the numbers there 
with,

502
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,920
don't you think that they probably voted
for him?

503
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:19,010
A lot of it is for economic reasons 
because they thought that he's going to 

504
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,850
loosen up some regulations,
encourage industry.

505
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,220
I think it's the opposite.
I think a lot of the Union voters,

506
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,190
they thought Hillary Clinton was in the 
pocket of Goldman Sachs and they thought

507
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:31,191
Donald trump was his sort of economic 
protectionism is going to bring jobs 

508
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:31,760
back to the Midwest.
Um,

509
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,860
which encourage industry.
But that's one of the things I disagree 

510
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,830
with the idea of.
For example,

511
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,660
I've been in Michigan,
the unions have a stranglehold.

512
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,960
I would rather be able to move to Texas 
or anywhere they want to be competitive 

513
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,921
in the car market,
but I can't even get to that because as 

514
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:48,921
soon as I'm going,
we don't.

515
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:49,590
Hold on.
Donald trump made a mistake here.

516
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:54,591
I disagree with them because then 
there's a women's march where their 

517
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:57,051
lighting hair on fire and calling him 
literally Hitler and sliding hair on 

518
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:57,051
fire.

519
00:19:57,051 --> 00:20:00,570
What do you mean?
At the woman's March girl got her hair 

520
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:00,570
lit on fire.
A girl?

521
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,440
Yeah.
By someone with one of those pussy hat 

522
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:03,440
and say,
you know what,

523
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,751
man?
The thing about that stuff is it's 

524
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:07,560
always one fucking person or a couple 
people out of hundreds of thousands that

525
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:11,000
are acting in that mob mentality and 
interrupt violence.

526
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,120
Shit.
Incorrect.

527
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,780
Oh,
come on,

528
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:17,781
man.
There's not that many people that do 

529
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:17,781
violence shit.
At those women's marches,

530
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:17,781
there was no arrests?
No.

531
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:22,610
Every.
Well there are no rest of the lansing 

532
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:22,610
protest either where they cut down a 
tent with box cutters.

533
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,140
There were,
there were the lansing protests when it 

534
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,140
went right to work.
That was a big thing where I was there,

535
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,300
but even the inauguration protest.
That's the one you got punched?

536
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,320
Yeah,
I did get punched,

537
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,240
so that wasn't fun.
It's hilarious.

538
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,740
They couldn't punch.
Well.

539
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:36,060
I know,
but when you're not expecting,

540
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,920
why throw a punch when you don't know 
how to punch.

541
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:38,580
Like,
come on.

542
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,710
Think about everywhere.
Leftists gather though,

543
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,360
whether it's woodstock back then.
Woodstock,

544
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,230
[inaudible],
99 Woodstock High Wall Street.

545
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,470
Violent.
Yes.

546
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,480
There are so many rapes.
How do you know you there?

547
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,540
There are reports of rape that's rapes 
that occurred where they rape rapes or 

548
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,091
were they like.
I think back then they were back then 

549
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:00,091
Lena Dunham wasn't,
you know,

550
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:04,370
shoving fast food napkins.
And her sister's cooch claiming she was 

551
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:04,370
raped because she saw the condom in a 
potted plant.

552
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,210
So what?
Lena Dunham,

553
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:12,211
she claimed she was raped because she 
saw the condom on a plant after she was 

554
00:21:12,211 --> 00:21:14,941
drunk and muscle relaxers.
I feel like we always go back to Lena 

555
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:14,941
Dunham.
Yeah.

556
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:14,980
Um,
I didn't know about that story.

557
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:19,981
I knew that there was some sort of a 
gross interaction with her younger 

558
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:21,250
sister.
She was reaching inner inner,

559
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,750
inner,
Inner Vagina.

560
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,540
But the point is anywhere leftists 
gather,

561
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,050
there's always violence and 
exaggeration.

562
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:30,430
I mean,
when the women's March,

563
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,890
no violence,
there was no arrest.

564
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,870
There was no nothing else that can you 
say there was no violence,

565
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:37,210
but people said there was no violence at
all of these other marches.

566
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,840
Right.
Girls I can.

567
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,570
It's like isolated incidents,
but when you have to look at a trend,

568
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:48,571
right?
I'm not saying everyone got a million 

569
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:48,571
people in la.
A million people march,

570
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:49,870
right?
It's 970,000

571
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:50,270
people.
Okay,

572
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,090
but you have way more than that with the
tea party,

573
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:54,220
which was accused of being racist.
Not One minute.

574
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:55,940
There are way more than that.
No,

575
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,440
no,
no,

576
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,690
no,
no,

577
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,000
no,
no.

578
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:02,010
You never had a march in la that had 
more people than 970 across the country 

579
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,830
with the first year.
Yeah.

580
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Yeah.
More people across the country with the 

581
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:07,920
tea party.
There's no way.

582
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Hold on a second.
Not a model.

583
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,650
The day of the women's March when there 
were hundreds of thousands of people all

584
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,890
over the country marching together in 
one day.

585
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,080
There was never a movement like that for
the tea party.

586
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,300
Yes.
There was a day with the tea party.

587
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:21,880
Had One day,
the one day Glen Beck,

588
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,310
100,000
in Washington DC.

589
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:29,610
Okay.
That's less than was in la for the 

590
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,671
women's,
but across the country because there 

591
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:32,671
were so many.
Like in Dallas,

592
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:34,480
there were four or five different ones.
I crossed out the same day.

593
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,940
Come on in the same day.
Now,

594
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:41,941
not how many different city here's had a
march like that for the tea party.

595
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,460
They were in hundreds of cities,
hundreds of cities simultaneously in one

596
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:50,461
day,
and it was bigger than the women's 

597
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:50,461
march.
Certainly comparable with a comparable,

598
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,810
comparable and not a single incident,
and they left.

599
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:54,250
The place is cleaner than they found 
them.

600
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,000
You look at occupy Wall Street,
suite 500 crimes including felonies.

601
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,210
You look at the women's March,
let's disregard the crime people up 

602
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,421
there with pussy hats,
bringing their two year old with the 

603
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:08,731
most profane,
disgusting signs you can imagine when 

604
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:11,470
leftist congregate.
It's generally not a peaceful assembly,

605
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:13,870
not in the same way as when people who 
are right wing congregate.

606
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,870
Look at Berkeley,
Jake shields of Vegan from Berkeley is 

607
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,901
becoming a vegetarian from Berkeley is 
becoming conservative because if he just

608
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,740
said this was,
this was the rule,

609
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:26,170
not the exception in Berkeley.
Well I know Jake,

610
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:31,171
he's a buddy of mine and essentially he 
was saying that these people that were 

611
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:32,980
doing what they're claiming they're 
fighting fascist.

612
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:34,450
He's like,
you're being a fascist.

613
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,660
Do you understand what a fascist means 
using violence to enforce your ideology 

614
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:44,251
and your tolerating no deviations from 
that ideology that is being a fascist.

615
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,670
Yeah.
Pipe smoker blows,

616
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:49,940
bro to the on your own.
It takes too much effort.

617
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:54,941
But um,
but we had them on the show and he was 

618
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:54,941
saying like,
you know,

619
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:54,941
I just,
it's changed where the left.

620
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:58,751
We need to call this out and we need to,
we need to take ownership over this and 

621
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,620
when you need to squash it because it's 
becoming a real problem.

622
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,900
It's also a problem when you say the 
left,

623
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,110
the left or the right,
because it's not necessarily just the 

624
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,110
left.
It's these fucking idiots.

625
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,981
They go to these things and put masks on
and want to beat people up and mace 

626
00:24:11,981 --> 00:24:12,860
women.
I saw that girl with a make make bitcoin

627
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:17,861
great again hat.
She had a joke hat and someone hit her 

628
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:17,861
over the head with a stick.
Yeah,

629
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:21,080
that was holding up a sign and then 
another guy master face.

630
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:23,010
I mean,
and they think that they can spend it on

631
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,400
people getting pulled out of cars,
getting punched,

632
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:26,460
you know,
occupy Wall Street.

633
00:24:26,461 --> 00:24:29,690
You had people putting bloody rags on 
tents that they claimed had aids.

634
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:30,440
I mean anywhere.
Again,

635
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:32,390
just go back through history in the last
decade,

636
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,150
it's very different and not saying all 
left,

637
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:35,750
right?
We're speaking.

638
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,940
You have to speak in generalities to 
save time.

639
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,420
But as a general rule,
if you look at the right,

640
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,590
if you look at,
for example,

641
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:44,030
the tea party,
you look at the movement,

642
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:47,270
people who were complaining about the 
stimulus package,

643
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:49,220
you look at people at economic problems 
with Barack Obama.

644
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,460
They didn't riot.
They didn't beat people up in record 

645
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,621
numbers.
There was not a single trash can lid on 

646
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:59,081
fire thrown through a window.
That seems to be a common occurrence at 

647
00:24:59,081 --> 00:24:59,081
these leftist protests.
Well,

648
00:24:59,081 --> 00:24:59,480
it is now.
It is now.

649
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,670
It certainly isn't now power.
Well,

650
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:06,671
it's also these people feel like what 
Donald Trump represents is the worst 

651
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,400
possible scenario for the right.
They feel like he represents this,

652
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:15,401
like really arrogant businessman who 
promotes rape culture and grabbing 

653
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,540
pussies and you know,
that's how,

654
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,040
that's how they're looking at it.
So they're like,

655
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:22,550
it's time to act like there was some 
woman who was on Fox News,

656
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:22,800
the other.

657
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,520
Who's the one that Dude Tucker.
Tucker Carlson.

658
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

659
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,320
Is he a Fox News Guy?
He's.

660
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,420
He used to be CNN on crossfire and he 
had some woman on and she was talking a 

661
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:32,500
little Asian.
Yeah,

662
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:32,960
yeah,
yeah.

663
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:38,330
She's a fucking school teacher.
She's talking about Bob Blop and I was 

664
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:38,330
like,
this is crazy.

665
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,550
Like she's talking about.
She called Milo Yiannopoulos,

666
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,700
who's a gay Jew by the way.
She called them homophobic and prefers 

667
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,300
prefers black men.
Yeah,

668
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,810
I mean,
but how do you call it gang guy?

669
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:49,190
Homophobic.
Just what?

670
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,540
Everyone's a Nazi now.
I mean,

671
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:53,480
I was not for trump in the primary so I 
could call the Kuk right.

672
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:54,170
And I was like,
well listen,

673
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,790
he's,
he's the most liberal Republican ever.

674
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,170
People don't want to talk.
He's the only one,

675
00:25:57,171 --> 00:26:02,171
a Democrat,
most of his last president to ever take 

676
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:02,420
office being pro gay marriage when he 
was sworn in.

677
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,420
Barack Obama can't even claim that.
That's true.

678
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:09,430
It was the first person.
That's something that people need to 

679
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,100
recognize about Hillary Clinton.
She was anti gay marriage is recently as

680
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,380
2013.
She was,

681
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,020
she was speaking in 2013.
And she said,

682
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:20,021
I believe that marriage is a bond 
between a man and a woman in 2013.

683
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:25,690
And she was making arguments to.
It wasn't like she was put on the spot 

684
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,241
and well,
I think she was out there arguing 

685
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:28,241
against same sex marriage.
So,

686
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:29,040
um,
you know,

687
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,350
my point here is they're out of power 
and so they declare everyone a Nazi,

688
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:34,610
you know,
they declared me a Nazi,

689
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:36,740
they'll declare Milo Nazi.
And so if you say,

690
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,070
hey,
there,

691
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:39,920
it's okay to punch Nazis in the face.
If Hitler walked in here,

692
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,650
you'd probably have a tussle with Adolf 
Hitler,

693
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,040
but it's acceptable if you

694
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,670
make me or even you or milo equivalent 
to Hitler.

695
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,820
And that's what they're doing now.
And that's the point that I'm making is 

696
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,030
I think because they behaved so poorly,
more Americans would,

697
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,090
would vote,
screw you with a lever and vote for 

698
00:26:59,090 --> 00:26:59,090
Donald trump now than they did under 
member eighth.

699
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,620
I believe that's highly speculative.
It is highly strict crowder,

700
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,510
hence the pipe.
We can speculate and highly speculative.

701
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,000
Not sure if I buy it might maybe let me 
present.

702
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:14,001
People are also freaking out.
They're freaking out about his 

703
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:17,301
appointment of a Golden Sachs executive.
They're freaking out over what's 

704
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:20,841
happening with that Flynn fellow who was
forced to resign because he was 

705
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:24,740
coordinating with Russia and you know,
talking about removing sanctions before 

706
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,690
they got into office and all that stuff.
Well,

707
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,930
that was a screw up.
But,

708
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:28,410
um,
you know,

709
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:29,940
and I'm not here to defend Donald Trump.

710
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,680
Screw up,
we call it trees.

711
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:35,910
It is by making them a five.
He's a whole new man.

712
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,650
Um,
it is delicious though,

713
00:27:37,651 --> 00:27:38,480
isn't it?
It's good.

714
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:40,230
It really is good.
High as fuck right now.

715
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,050
Oh really?
Yeah.

716
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:47,150
He hits some marijuana after this.
Probably like takes it to the next 

717
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,990
level.
Gets you high as fuck man.

718
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,300
That's pretty low in nicotine and 
aromantic like that.

719
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:52,790
Yeah.
But I'm a rookie or you don't?

720
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,920
I don't smoke any weed.
Smoke a cigar.

721
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,060
Yeah.
That's pretty occasional.

722
00:27:58,061 --> 00:27:59,880
Like maybe once a month I'll puff a 
cigar.

723
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,080
Yeah.
Well,

724
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,890
yeah,
there you go.

725
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:03,720
You can keep that one.
That one's already broken in.

726
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,780
Can keep this pipe yet because there's a
real process with a pipe.

727
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,620
It's actually,
you know,

728
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:12,621
you have to smoke it really slow when 
you first get it because the briar 

729
00:28:12,621 --> 00:28:15,531
expands.
So I know pure faggotry sending a 

730
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:17,790
different voice.
Fuel faggotry and to them.

731
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,130
Um,
I don't know if that's a word.

732
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,390
Train them.
Train them.

733
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,850
Let me present this.
Okay.

734
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,240
You take someone like Bernie Sanders,
son of a bitch,

735
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,430
he explained to relax.
Drink.

736
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:30,720
Do you drink?
I can't drink.

737
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,170
You drink some whiskey.
Let's get some whiskey up in here and we

738
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,010
need to make a beer if you have to.
Very.

739
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,430
We need drink,
drink real booze.

740
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,040
What do you want to talk about?
I just want to relax a little.

741
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,540
Okay.
I want you to be a human.

742
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:46,200
I don't want all these talking points.
These aren't talking fired up to fucking

743
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:48,420
defend the write and promote your 
agenda.

744
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:53,421
I'll just.
Because I know you said people like to 

745
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:53,421
think you're an asshole because you're 
right wing.

746
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:54,450
I don't care what they think.
People think I'm a fucking meathead.

747
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,200
Well,
I'm right.

748
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,030
There are.
I am in a way,

749
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,170
very meat,
heavy,

750
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,610
strong,
not well.

751
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:02,250
I'm fucking.
I eat meat a,

752
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,110
I'm a cage fighting commentator.

753
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,890
I look like a meathead.
There's a lot of meathead qualities that

754
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:10,050
I possess.
Although I'm a kind person,

755
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,500
very openminded and more probably more 
left than I am.

756
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,240
Right?
If you looked at a giant spectrum,

757
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,370
don't think so.
No.

758
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,270
No,
not anymore.

759
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,460
I just think it's such a narrow path on 
the left.

760
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:25,490
There's so unaccepting of people.
That's why you've seen all this very 

761
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:25,490
accepting in that way.
I mean,

762
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,870
I'm very accepting,
even have ridiculous ideas.

763
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,450
I want you to talk about them.
You know why?

764
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,540
I just think one of the real problems 
that I have right now with all these 

765
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,951
protestors and all these people that are
going crazy and calling everybody Nazis 

766
00:29:36,951 --> 00:29:39,801
is you're stifling communication and 
you're stifling the marketplace of 

767
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:42,120
Freddy's.
I want real booze broke.

768
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:44,050
Get up,
get out some whiskey straight.

769
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,690
What's good?
Even better.

770
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,920
Make it hurt.
Bring out some whiskey.

771
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,220
Trying to bring out that Alex Jones 
whiskey the stuff that makes you talk 

772
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,361
about interdimensional child molesters 
actually stopped talking about pizza 

773
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:57,361
gate.
Remember?

774
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:58,840
That was a big contract.
So you didn't want to have them on here.

775
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,010
Oh really?
Oh yeah.

776
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,910
Eddie was probably instigating.
Eddie was out of his fucking mind drunk.

777
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:08,911
He doesn't know what he did.
I remember you asked me the one thing 

778
00:30:08,911 --> 00:30:08,911
about this pizza.
Good thing.

779
00:30:08,911 --> 00:30:10,000
And again,
I don't think it's going to go.

780
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,310
Um,
it may not be true,

781
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,280
but what do you think about what a 
Bright Bart was saying?

782
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:20,310
Like way back in 2011 about pedesta that
pedesta like shields files.

783
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,270
Come on.
Don't be a pussy with a beer.

784
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,120
I'm going with a beer.
I have to go to the airport.

785
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,190
You and Jack gets marketing.
I think he gave it to me for free.

786
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,820
Fuck off.
Gentleman.

787
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,380
Gentleman,
Jack.

788
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,840
Jack Daniels did.
No,

789
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,120
no.
I like.

790
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,850
I enjoy Jack Town.
Actually never had gentleman.

791
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:44,610
Jack.
Yeah.

792
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,650
Now I'm well [inaudible] you asked me 
about it in the first thing where my 

793
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:52,840
antenna went up with pizza gate.
As I said,

794
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:56,630
Jane James Alefantis means I love kids 
in French and I.

795
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:57,670
I know where they're trying to get it 
from.

796
00:30:57,671 --> 00:31:01,660
It's a Jim Lee's on fa.
That's not James Alefantis.

797
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,220
So right away when it's the PR,
the first premise that I read is a lie.

798
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:07,030
I'm going,
all right,

799
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:12,180
well there was a bunch of weird ones,
but there was some stuff that was like 

800
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:16,860
really odd,
like the pizza place that had that 

801
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,590
symbol.
That is the international fucking symbol

802
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:21,500
for pedophilia and trauma lasting and 
beyond says in the Illuminati and.

803
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:26,510
But no,
this as a symbol that the FBI admits 

804
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,760
that they use in these secret 
organizations that when they capture 

805
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:29,760
pedophiles,
which they do all the time.

806
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,850
Yeah,
they use that symbol.

807
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,200
I mean they agree upon that symbol that 
says there's a lot of weirdness to it.

808
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:36,640
And here's the thing.
It could be,

809
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:39,400
this is my take on it and I'm not.
I don't have a side and I'm not,

810
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,200
I'm not claiming that I have any 
knowledge,

811
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:44,890
but there absolutely are pedophile 
rings.

812
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,960
They exist.
They have caught them before they busted

813
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:50,640
them before.
Like Jerry Sandusky kid just got busted.

814
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:52,990
I know yesterday.
That was the beauty of Michael Jackson.

815
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,700
The guy was so clever about it.
Think about it.

816
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,760
He screwed every kid in Hollywood except
Macaulay Culkin.

817
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,410
So he's at Canary in the coal mine.
Macola caulkins and no,

818
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,320
no,
I go to Neverland ranch.

819
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:07,321
He never touched me here.
That's what I would say to other kids 

820
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:09,391
are coming back.
They still swear up and that's what I 

821
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:09,391
would say.
It's like if you went,

822
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:11,170
if you went to a bachelor party and 
everybody got their Dick sucked and your

823
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:11,920
wife said,
Hey,

824
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:12,670
what the fuck?

825
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,340
Bobby says he got his dick suck.
Not Me.

826
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,990
I don't know what I mean.
Maybe she just didn't like me.

827
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:22,050
You get up.
Macaulay Culkin has no reason to say 

828
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,050
that now.
Yes,

829
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,050
he does.
Really?

830
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,990
Yeah.
Nobody wants to know that you got 

831
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:25,990
molested by Michael Jackson.
You'll never get a girlfriend again.

832
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,370
Should we get one hell of a book deal?
Come on.

833
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,600
You shouldn't be about to go down on 
you.

834
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:29,410
And she'll think,
oh my God,

835
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:34,411
Michael Jackson's right.
Don't you think you'll get one hell of a

836
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,170
book deal?
Well,

837
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,200
you know,
Andrew Breitbart actually not Breitbart 

838
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,200
the trademark.
Andrew Breitbart,

839
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,200
the name is.
I mean,

840
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,200
he was actually,
I

841
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,110
got my start and um,
he wrote about that,

842
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:43,550
you know,
Neverland ranch.

843
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:48,551
His photographer was a pornographer who 
specialized in European actors who 

844
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:52,760
looked under age.
And so once he talked about this,

845
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:57,761
the guy was fired from Neverland ranch,
I think it was six months later he was 

846
00:32:57,761 --> 00:32:57,761
back.
So my point was like,

847
00:32:57,761 --> 00:32:59,960
the pizza good stuff is there are things
that are provable like that,

848
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:04,990
which people can go search Andrew 
Breitbart and find that story and 

849
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,500
because people are cocked and loaded to 
hate someone from the right online 

850
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,430
cocked what you really do go into a 
different voice was with nasty words.

851
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:15,560
That was my beavis and butthead voice.
Because of that,

852
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:20,561
I'd rather dwell on stories that we know
we can prove or commentary because it's 

853
00:33:20,561 --> 00:33:20,561
really easy to go,
oh,

854
00:33:20,561 --> 00:33:22,250
crowder was wrong with pizza gate or 
whatever it is.

855
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,170
So we just,
there's so much there that's real.

856
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,390
That's where I focus.
That's my issue with Alex Jones.

857
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,660
Alex Jones go super deep and I did not 
know him before I had him,

858
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:33,200
that he was a sandy hook denier and I 
saw that and it's pretty rough.

859
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:34,970
It hurt my soul.
It really did.

860
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,040
Yeah.
He's um,

861
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,540
he's been.
His son is a fan.

862
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:43,541
He's been really,
really good to me and coming on the 

863
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:45,851
show.
He's done the young Turks sketches with 

864
00:33:45,851 --> 00:33:47,471
us.
I think he's doing less of the 

865
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:47,540
conspiracy stuff now.
It seems like less now.

866
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,910
Get them,
get them drunk,

867
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,770
get them drunk and watch it come out.
Well,

868
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,340
it doesn't surprise me.
Alex has been my friend for a long time.

869
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:59,030
He's 84 percent crazy,
but uh,

870
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:00,560
he's,
he's,

871
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:05,620
he's like,
it's one of those things where if you 

872
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:11,081
chase,
there's enough corruption and enough 

873
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:11,081
crazy shit in the world that if you 
chase it down,

874
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,470
you're going to find it right?

875
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:17,740
It's there.
But you got to be careful what you call 

876
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,981
it,
corruption and what you call 

877
00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:20,981
conspiracies,
right?

878
00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:22,580
Because there are a fuck ton of them 
that he's missing the mark.

879
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:24,080
Like the sandy hook thing.
I mean that,

880
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,810
that,
that the sandy hook thing is so fucked.

881
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:31,520
There was a great article that was 
written about a guy who was a conspiracy

882
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:35,810
theorist until his kid was killed at 
Sandy Hook.

883
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,120
Right?
And then realized like,

884
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:40,250
Holy Shit,
like these people are telling me that my

885
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:45,251
kid didn't die when I realized how 
dangerous this whole thinking that the 

886
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:50,381
government spraying shit in the sky from
mind control mind control organization.

887
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,830
I've been told that I'm in the fucking 
CIA.

888
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:59,890
Oh yeah,
there are people think I'm in the 

889
00:34:59,890 --> 00:34:59,890
Illuminati.
How do we get in?

890
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,990
I think they'd be Tuesdays.
Do you think you could get in or we.

891
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,010
Are you young to old?

892
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,760
Are you too young rather?
I have no idea.

893
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:09,761
I think you just need to have the all 
seeing eye and one of your music videos 

894
00:35:09,761 --> 00:35:09,761
and you're in like flint.
That is it.

895
00:35:09,761 --> 00:35:13,490
Do you just got to go like this?
I think they're doing diamonds.

896
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:15,810
He's saying I like diamonds.
Or is he like do it a little bit about.

897
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,020
Well,
I didn't realize diamond is also like a 

898
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,020
black term for a lady's Nether regions.
Really?

899
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,430
I found that in a risque song.
Smell.

900
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:24,600
Yo Dick.
You hear that song on Youtube?

901
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,320
Yeah,
I like that.

902
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:30,550
I was wild and I wasn't clown like that.
He says diamond like that.

903
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:35,551
No,
it wasn't this feeling or die length 

904
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:38,020
that like that.
I've heard of white people who are out 

905
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,020
of touch with black culture.
That's.

906
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,610
That was ridiculous.
Welcome.

907
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,820
Welcome to me.
I didn't know I have to tune to jamie 

908
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:43,820
because Jamie's on black twitter 
everyday.

909
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:48,740
Jamie keeps.
He's done a vine must have been rough 

910
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,311
for you.
Jamie's got tweet deck and he sets up 

911
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:54,570
one hashtag black twitter and it's just 
all black,

912
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,480
but it's all just black twitter 
references and he tells me that people 

913
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,440
steal from black twitter and they make 
jokes on late night tv because yeah,

914
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,770
it's a subculture.
Yeah.

915
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:10,790
Black twitter.
They say funny shit and then people 

916
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:10,790
steal it.
Is that true,

917
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:10,790
Jamie?
Is that what you just said?

918
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,340
What I heard,
that's the rumor.

919
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,380
That is what he heard.
I've heard that too.

920
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,790
Um,
when did women.

921
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,590
But speaking of which like black is a 
subculture,

922
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,850
right?
We talked about minority groups.

923
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:19,910
I think you need another drink.
Women more whiskey.

924
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,540
I'll take to finish that.
No,

925
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,370
I didn't finish them on posts.
Come on.

926
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,620
That doesn't work on me yet.
So you weren't an Illuminati.

927
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,120
You're feeling men like that?

928
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,030
See diamonds a stripper.
Oh,

929
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,930
I was wrong all this time.
This whole thing up dude.

930
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:37,080
See you're spreading disinformation.
How much time and Dick,

931
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,290
wait a minute.
Hold on.

932
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,790
See that's not how a bitch get her ass.
Woke up.

933
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,590
That's just lazy.
How long reach get her.

934
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:44,730
I swab.
Yes,

935
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,020
please.
Promoting violence against women because

936
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,140
she wants to smell his dick.
She beats the hell out of her,

937
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,560
but that's lazy.
So to her,

938
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,660
that's not my fault song.
Right?

939
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,750
They didn't even introduce the character
diamond beforehand.

940
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:56,490
How am I supposed to know what we can't 
know?

941
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,560
That's not a racism thing.
That's a bad song.

942
00:36:58,561 --> 00:36:59,370
Okay.
If he said,

943
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:02,700
I ain't even feel in Mercedes like that,
would you assume?

944
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:07,701
Okay.
Mercedes is probably a stripper lapses 

945
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:07,970
to the main stage probably,
but I don't.

946
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,650
I didn't read the lyrics so I didn't see
a capital and diamond.

947
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:15,650
I can't know this [inaudible] I was 
trying to be understanding of another 

948
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,620
culture and it backfired.
I'm gonna give you that.

949
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,790
Yeah.
Why isn't he just washed his dick?

950
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,620
Like when you go to the crab shack,
we have that automatic hand cleaner,

951
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,320
doesn't have hand sanitizer and keeps in
his fucking.

952
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:31,530
Ben's just spray thieves.
Essential oil.

953
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:33,300
Like my wife's not sure.
Dick Brown,

954
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,880
dirty bitch coming home with a dirty 
dick.

955
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,610
Jesus.
That's worse than adultery start.

956
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,630
That's not his wife for sure.
First of all,

957
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:47,670
they're not married.
This is not a marriage we're talking 

958
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:47,670
about.
This is not saying,

959
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:47,790
oh,
look at this.

960
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,590
More booze.
Bring it out.

961
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:52,860
Both bring them both out.
This guy needs to get drunk talks.

962
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:56,460
Too much shit.
Want we want to talk about everything?

963
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,150
Life Generale.
Okay.

964
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,600
Let's say this generally a,
I've never been as mad as I was watching

965
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:04,380
that Holly Holm fight.

966
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,750
Why?
Because of the uh,

967
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:11,930
here's what I think.
I think if you hit someone after the 

968
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,881
bell and it's really clear,
it should be an immediate point 

969
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:14,160
deduction and they should be given time 
to recover more than a minute.

970
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,940
That's just an opinion you twice.
But I agree with you.

971
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:19,500
But here's why I disagree with you.
I,

972
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,530
I'm even more extreme.
I think that hitting someone after the 

973
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,460
bell is grounds for disqualification 
because you know,

974
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,320
you know,
you know,

975
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,590
fam,
you know down your whole mindset 

976
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:33,590
changes.
You're not expecting it.

977
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,650
She definitely heard the bell.
The guy was stepping in,

978
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,130
she threw

979
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,830
the shots.
It's grounds for disqualification.

980
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,170
I fought,
you know,

981
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:44,200
it's been a long time,
but I did and I heard bells and I didn't

982
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:46,420
hit anybody afterwards.
You know what the fuck it is,

983
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,770
you know what it is.
Well,

984
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:52,771
if you do the point deduction,
holly wins that fight or a draw for 

985
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:52,771
sure.
Germain de Randamie is fucking awesome.

986
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:57,661
She's an awesome fighter.
I mean she is a 46 and o 10 time world 

987
00:38:57,661 --> 00:38:59,020
champion and for that to happen with her
it,

988
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:01,480
it upsets me in,
in two ways.

989
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,820
One,
it upsets me because holly got fouled.

990
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,520
Intuit upsets me because she's a great 
fighter.

991
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,290
For her to do something like that was 
like,

992
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:11,530
why did you do that?
Don't do that.

993
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,210
Yeah.
And she rocked holly.

994
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,830
The problem is when you rock someone who
knows how much that affects them for the

995
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:20,800
rest of the fight,
holly is so bad ass.

996
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:25,950
She not only came back from that,
she came back from that wound up head 

997
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,730
kicking Jermaine,
dropping her and then rocking her little

998
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:30,040
hook that you threw that we've looked at
in that first.

999
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:30,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

1000
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,660
With just straight left.
I thought I was like a hook.

1001
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,650
All he rocked her straight legs are 
straight left that she was coming in,

1002
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:37,690
so it's just really short.
Then perfect shot.

1003
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,670
Yeah,
she's incredible.

1004
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,740
She's so bad ass.
In that question.

1005
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:43,930
Mark kick that she hit her with over the
top of the shoulder,

1006
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:46,330
drops down and hits her in the head.
Isn't it funny though that she doesn't.

1007
00:39:46,331 --> 00:39:48,280
She doesn't fight like a boxer in the 
octagon at all.

1008
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:53,281
She.
It's much more like an American 

1009
00:39:53,281 --> 00:39:54,601
kickboxer well,
because she was also an American 

1010
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,211
kickboxer and she's also trained by Mike
Winkeljohn who was one of the best 

1011
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:58,600
American kickboxing from his era.

1012
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,840
He was world class in his time.
He's really good.

1013
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:03,520
When he fought,
he fought Rick Rufus.

1014
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,860
He fought some really good guys.
He said great striking coach man.

1015
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,460
Very similar to him.
You know when I'm in Dallas,

1016
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:12,010
Guy Metzger,
very similar style to that kind of stand

1017
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,360
up.
Not as much head movement.

1018
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,730
That Guy Metzger is a good friend of 
mine.

1019
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:18,130
I love that guy.
He's really just an awesome guy.

1020
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,810
I won't get into personal stories,
but he's been.

1021
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:23,860
He's done some really nice things for 
people and he's a really.

1022
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,810
He's the exact example of when people 
say fighters are our meatheads,

1023
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,870
you just really kindhearted guy.
Well,

1024
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:33,871
he's definitely not immediate.
I'm more of a meathead than him for 

1025
00:40:33,871 --> 00:40:33,871
sure.
He's a,

1026
00:40:33,871 --> 00:40:35,860
he's not just a kindhearted guy.
He's very intelligent,

1027
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,920
soft spoken.
You never hear Guy Metzger yelling at 

1028
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:40,920
people and he's,
he's also,

1029
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,990
you know,
he's worked really hard to mitigate some

1030
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:45,000
of his,
uh,

1031
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,650
brain trauma and been really open about 
it,

1032
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,000
which I think is very,
very,

1033
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:54,001
very important because it's like this 
silent thing that guys don't want to 

1034
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:54,001
talk about the issues that they're 
dealing with from fighting.

1035
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:56,260
Yeah.
Well he also.

1036
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,870
Did you hear the story about when he got
into the fight in a parking lot?

1037
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,410
It was like a bunch of guys who jumped 
him you about,

1038
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,690
well,
how long this one?

1039
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,720
That long ago.
We were probably thinking the one where 

1040
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,721
the guy had a knife and stabbed him in 
the face because he got in between an 

1041
00:41:09,721 --> 00:41:09,980
altercation between a minute and you 
just don't do that.

1042
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:11,110
And when it was done,
go out fighting,

1043
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,940
stay home.
No,

1044
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,290
this was something maybe he may not want
me to tell the story,

1045
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:15,760
but it was in a parking lot.
Something happened.

1046
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:20,761
I don't know how it started,
but what happened was there were three 

1047
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:22,591
or four guys and all he did was he 
grabbed one guy just got him to the 

1048
00:41:22,591 --> 00:41:23,320
ground somehow and put him in a choke 
hold.

1049
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,310
And he told his friend,
he said,

1050
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:25,960
if you come forward,
I'm going to choke your friend out.

1051
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,330
And they just got back into their rav 
four,

1052
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,730
close the doors.
He let the guy go.

1053
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,100
They were gone.
That's a really nice person.

1054
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,590
Most people chose that guy as well.
He also,

1055
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:37,910
he's a striker.
He could have really hurt him.

1056
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,620
Yeah.
That's kind of the beauty of grappling.

1057
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:42,050
You can hurt them or not as much as you 
want to.

1058
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,140
Master is a very high level striker.
I mean,

1059
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:47,750
he's not known as a grappler,
so that's why he's a grappler to.

1060
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:51,670
He choked out.
Tito Ortiz was one of his first UFC.

1061
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,870
He just won worlds at Brown in the 
senior division.

1062
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:54,720
Did it really?
Yeah,

1063
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,360
that's amazing.
Yeah,

1064
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:57,770
he's still competing and doing that 
stuff.

1065
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:02,771
That's pretty awesome.
That's a nice thing for people that 

1066
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:03,250
don't want to strike anymore.
I know Baba loose abroad,

1067
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,020
he's been doing a lot of grappling 
competitions,

1068
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:06,650
staff,
you know,

1069
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,080
guys that just have taken a lot of head 
trauma,

1070
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,060
a lot of crazy fights,
long careers.

1071
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,790
They still like to compete.
They can do that.

1072
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:14,990
And you know,
and Bob Ballou has,

1073
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,600
um,
I think it's Bob Lose Iron Jim,

1074
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:22,601
I think that is what he calls it and 
he's got a really nice high level jim 

1075
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:26,540
down in Orange County and you know,
that's an explanation every time parents

1076
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:30,270
taking their kids for lessons,
they walk in and see Bob Ballou great.

1077
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,750
But they have to do that.
That kind of.

1078
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,500
Right.
Let me,

1079
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,920
let you see the tattoos up his neck.
Yeah.

1080
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,550
Parents are going to be a little 
apprehensive.

1081
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:40,670
Great Guy.
He's a great guy and he's a real pioneer

1082
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:43,020
in Bob Ballou was in the early,
early days of fighting.

1083
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:44,870
You say there's a fight with him and 
Brad Kohler.

1084
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:49,871
It's one of the fucking scariest 
knockouts ever because it was back when 

1085
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:49,940
you could soccer kick on the ground and 
uh,

1086
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,120
he dropped Brad Colt because Bob Ballou 
was one of the first Brazilian 

1087
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,180
wrestlers,
which a lot of people don't know.

1088
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:01,180
I mean he was a black belt in Brazilian 
Jujitsu and very good striker and all 

1089
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,301
those things.
But he also was on the Brazilian 

1090
00:43:04,301 --> 00:43:04,930
national wrestling team back in the day.
And so Brad Kohler,

1091
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:08,940
who was like this really beefed up 
fucking just jacked dude could,

1092
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:12,680
couldn't touch them on the feet and Bob 
will eventually got them tired out.

1093
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,800
And when he dropped him,
got him down to the ground,

1094
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,970
he fucking soccer kicked him into 
oblivion.

1095
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:21,971
It was just those days when you can,
when you could soccer kick someone who 

1096
00:43:21,971 --> 00:43:23,150
was already tired and down.
Those are,

1097
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,360
those are dark.
But to put it into context of Brazilian 

1098
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,491
national wrestling team,
they'd be like ventures to Oklahoma 

1099
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:31,670
state wrestlers.
It's just not even the same level maybe,

1100
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,920
but a high level wrestlers.
A high level roadside is,

1101
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,120
but it's like Sarah Mcmahon,
you know,

1102
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:40,121
she was silver at the Olympics number 
when people said she was going to beat 

1103
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:40,121
Rhonda with the wrestling.

1104
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:40,121
I'm like,
well,

1105
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:43,841
hold on a second.
The talent pool in women's wrestling is 

1106
00:43:43,841 --> 00:43:43,841
nowhere near where it is judo at that 
point.

1107
00:43:43,841 --> 00:43:45,520
I mean,
you just have women in Japan in judo who

1108
00:43:45,521 --> 00:43:46,700
are criminals.
Um,

1109
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:50,120
Kayla Harrison to following her.
She was actually one of the first guests

1110
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:52,460
on our show.
She just a monster,

1111
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,260
you know,
there's no one in female wrestling.

1112
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:59,290
No one who will even come close to her 
level of experience with them in the 

1113
00:43:59,290 --> 00:43:59,290
same can be said about Brazilian 
Jujitsu,

1114
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:00,200
you know,
Brazilian Jujitsu,

1115
00:44:00,201 --> 00:44:02,690
which isn't in the Olympics yet,
but really should be,

1116
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,590
is there's some phenomenal.
You've seen Mackenzie dern.

1117
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:09,650
I've seen her compete in MMA.
Uh,

1118
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:10,340
I haven't seen it.
Well,

1119
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:15,341
yeah,
I was the most bad ass choke outs that 

1120
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:15,620
I've ever seen in my life.
She started with an Omoplata,

1121
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:16,910
worked away.
This girl's back.

1122
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:22,120
She's got this move that she does where 
she gets a in on the plot that and she 

1123
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,030
rolls over onto her back and chokes this
chick out.

1124
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,480
Apparently she hits this move all the 
time.

1125
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:32,080
Will they teach something similar to 
that at Marcello Garcia School in New 

1126
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,080
York,
where if ever someone turtling you

1127
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:37,350
said your knee into their ribs and their
hip crease and you kind of get around 

1128
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,610
not quite an Omoplata,
but you're bringing your other leg 

1129
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:40,830
around their front and you're wrapping 
and you're blocking.

1130
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:43,050
If let's save coming in from your right 
side,

1131
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,840
you blocked her left arm,
which is something we actually would,

1132
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,380
would learn in judo quite a bit.
A really basic back.

1133
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:53,381
So you black,
you broke blocking by taking an 

1134
00:44:53,381 --> 00:44:55,791
underdog.
So you're in your admin console and 

1135
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:55,791
you're having risk control around so 
you're not putting a hook in.

1136
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,390
And when you control this,
the way they taught it to me,

1137
00:44:57,391 --> 00:45:02,391
like if you watch Marcella Garcia,
they'll just go for the choke straight 

1138
00:45:02,391 --> 00:45:05,301
from there.
They don't even need to get their hooks 

1139
00:45:05,301 --> 00:45:05,301
in.
Right.

1140
00:45:05,301 --> 00:45:05,301
And uh,
you know,

1141
00:45:05,301 --> 00:45:08,301
then you have Clark race.
Who does the Omoplata role to the lapel 

1142
00:45:08,301 --> 00:45:08,301
choke?
I mean,

1143
00:45:08,301 --> 00:45:08,301
it really is.

1144
00:45:08,301 --> 00:45:12,620
The plan is.
I don't think there's been a submission 

1145
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,680
from that in a long time,
but there's only ever in the UFC history

1146
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,930
was Ben Saunders.
This is Mackenzie dern.

1147
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:21,090
Well,
that's how she does this for me is also 

1148
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,000
is that she's hot as fuck.
And so she,

1149
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:24,300
she gets,
she gets the Omoplata to the girl,

1150
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:26,520
tries to roll.
Now watch how she handles this.

1151
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,470
When she gets her from disposition.
No,

1152
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:28,720
no,
no.

1153
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,150
You've got to go back.
Got to go back.

1154
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,170
See,
I shouldn't even have her hooks.

1155
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,360
Oh,
it's just a highlight video.

1156
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,790
So she doesn't,
she doesn't need the hook.

1157
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,350
What she does is she rolls and you don't
see it from that position.

1158
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:41,970
Well that's a lot like a Nogi version of
clerk.

1159
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:43,290
Racies.
Omoplata Lapel.

1160
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,490
Show me.
See if they show it here.

1161
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,820
But she does is she gets up and when she
gets up on her hip,

1162
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,060
she the girl roles and then watch how 
she scrambles.

1163
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,210
Now she takes her,
right?

1164
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:57,500
They don't show it.
She takes her right arm and she rolls 

1165
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:57,500
underneath the girl.
Anyway,

1166
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,000
you know,
her dad is Megaton Diaz who's world 

1167
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,000
famous.
Yeah,

1168
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,000
no,
very,

1169
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,850
very respected.
Presented Jujitsu,

1170
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:04,560
black belt.
But um,

1171
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:09,750
there's the,
one of the coolest things about Jujitsu 

1172
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:09,750
is it's like almost like sentences and 
languages.

1173
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,670
There's so many different ways you can 
go with things.

1174
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,070
There's so many different possibilities.
It's just,

1175
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,230
it's almost never ending.
Well,

1176
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,160
there's a guy like my dad,
you know,

1177
00:46:17,161 --> 00:46:20,070
he's in his fifties and he hasn't lost a
point,

1178
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:25,250
let alone around competing up to purple 
belt and he competes against guys who 

1179
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:25,800
were 40 and open way because there's no 
one is age and uh,

1180
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,730
you know,
you played hockey,

1181
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:31,731
you have m high,
high level athlete and he's not super 

1182
00:46:31,731 --> 00:46:31,731
flexible.
He's not going to do a guard game.

1183
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,110
He got really good at takedowns,
really good at trips,

1184
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,150
really good at guard passing and side 
control of jokes,

1185
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:38,730
you know,
paper cutter and things like that.

1186
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,640
And he's,
he's diverse enough where he can protect

1187
00:46:41,641 --> 00:46:43,620
himself in areas.
But that's one thing too,

1188
00:46:43,621 --> 00:46:48,621
you know,
when I was helping coach him for his 

1189
00:46:48,621 --> 00:46:48,621
first tournament,
I'm like,

1190
00:46:48,621 --> 00:46:48,621
listen,
in training,

1191
00:46:48,621 --> 00:46:49,260
you want to work these positions,
you know,

1192
00:46:49,261 --> 00:46:50,520
you want to work your guard,
you want to work,

1193
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:55,550
we have guard,
but there's nothing that says in the 

1194
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:55,550
competition,
you can't stuff the head get up and just

1195
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:59,271
come up on top.
And when he realized that when he 

1196
00:46:59,271 --> 00:47:01,371
competes,
it's just getting out and getting on 

1197
00:47:01,371 --> 00:47:01,371
top.
And if he gets on top,

1198
00:47:01,371 --> 00:47:02,820
he's going to pass.
You know what his level at a purple belt

1199
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:07,830
level,
the problem with that strategies that 

1200
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:07,830
only works with someone who's weaker 
than you.

1201
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,530
Like as soon as you find someone who's 
better at that game than you,

1202
00:47:09,531 --> 00:47:12,330
you have to have other options.
So if he's not good off of his back,

1203
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,180
someone's eventually going to put them 
on his.

1204
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:15,840
But he's pretty good in his back.
Well that's good.

1205
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:16,920
But in a,
in a tournament,

1206
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,620
the point is there's no unwritten 
agreement where we're working,

1207
00:47:19,621 --> 00:47:20,790
passing.
Know what I mean?

1208
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,020
So he can try his scissor sweep,
which is a big thing for him as a strong

1209
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:30,021
guy and if it doesn't work,
he can do a technical standout and come 

1210
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:32,541
up.
Well Helson Gracie has the best 

1211
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:32,541
description of Jujitsu.
He said,

1212
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:36,720
you do this than I do that.
Then you do this than I do that forever.

1213
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:42,090
I love that because it's like once you 
tried Jujitsu,

1214
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:42,610
you go,
yeah,

1215
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:45,030
that is what it is.
Until someone taps like you,

1216
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:50,390
like Hixon Gracie has always been famous
for saying about other other athletes,

1217
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:55,951
other competitors that if they can't 
keep the rhythm there will lose some 

1218
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,600
amazing meaning.
Not like George St Pierre,

1219
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,780
but like meaning that he keeps,
keeps attacking and you keep defending 

1220
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,570
and counterattacking eventually you're 
going to slip up.

1221
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,610
He's going to get a dominant position.
Sure.

1222
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,060
And then once from there,
I'm not saying he's world class,

1223
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:11,530
I'm just saying he's able to learn a 
game.

1224
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,830
I know you want to Brag about your 
dad's.

1225
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,440
Thank you gentleman.
Jack,

1226
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,310
I guess on.
Oh no,

1227
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:19,050
that's normal.
Jack.

1228
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:21,570
This is a regular jet.
MMM.

1229
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:22,910
Um,
yeah.

1230
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:24,880
What does this stuff called?
This a Sinatra Shit.

1231
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,340
They're just.
That's how you sell it.

1232
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:33,680
If they were a sponsor sponsor,
you're getting phone calls yesterday it 

1233
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,850
was a Sinatra Shit and RPR 
representatives have a problem with 

1234
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:41,701
that.
Well then they wouldn't be a sponsor 

1235
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:41,701
anymore.
Nobody cares anymore,

1236
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:45,091
man.
This people who have to realize this is 

1237
00:48:45,091 --> 00:48:45,091
the age of Shit.
You can say it.

1238
00:48:45,091 --> 00:48:48,810
You know?
It's actually a great whiskey that has 

1239
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:48,810
wild Turkey one-on-one.
That stuff's disgusting.

1240
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:48,850
No,
no,

1241
00:48:48,851 --> 00:48:49,120
no,
no,

1242
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:49,390
no,
no,

1243
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:49,630
no,
no,

1244
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:49,930
no,
no.

1245
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,250
We have some.
You want some?

1246
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,030
No,
I'm good.

1247
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,040
Pussy,
but wild Turkey.

1248
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:56,560
One hundred one is a fantastic drink.
It really is.

1249
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,530
It's like Jim beam advertises aged four 
years.

1250
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,600
What about Turkey?
One on one is eight years off the bat.

1251
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,840
Why is it better to be old?
Why is it better for whiskey to be aged 

1252
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,950
or we would save in this tastes like 
shit.

1253
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,740
Just be honest.
It all tastes like shit.

1254
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,160
No.
Well,

1255
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:14,140
if the raw you want at younger with a 
bourbon,

1256
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:19,170
you want that.
You want more of that chart kind of 

1257
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:19,170
flavor in there anyway.
It's a good.

1258
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:22,770
It's a good whiskey.
The best whiskey can't fuck with 

1259
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:23,480
Koolaid.
Tastes better than the best whiskey.

1260
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,200
Cool.
What are you doing with Sinatra?

1261
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:28,090
She had.
I liked the pain.

1262
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:30,100
I like feeling.
I like the suffering.

1263
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,050
I like the suffering that comes with 
Jack Daniels.

1264
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:33,020
That's what I like.
Really.

1265
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,620
Like when you shoot that shot down and 
go,

1266
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,700
you know exactly what you just did.
You're not playing any stupid,

1267
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:42,550
you know it's poison.
I come here to enlighten myself.

1268
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:44,680
I'm here to spread love and Karma.

1269
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,060
Is that what people do?
What with Horchata?

1270
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:48,760
What's that?
With her child has a Mexican drink.

1271
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:50,350
Rum Shot,
shot,

1272
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,420
shot at some shit we get.
Whether you get tacos and inauthentic.

1273
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,230
Joint was thinking rum,
Chata I missed.

1274
00:49:55,231 --> 00:49:56,680
What's rum shot?
I don't even know what that is.

1275
00:49:56,681 --> 00:50:01,681
They sell it.
It's like Horchata but alcoholic and 

1276
00:50:01,681 --> 00:50:03,790
they saw a white bottle and it's already
premade and it's just got the spices and

1277
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:08,791
whatever.
The dairy filler is a good thing to 

1278
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:08,791
make.
Terrible decisions will not get.

1279
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:09,880
Jared loves it,
so it fits in perfectly.

1280
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,160
Oh,
he loves rum.

1281
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,590
Chose not to do so.
Fuck is not gay.

1282
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:19,591
Jared,
he's my producer and my show interest 

1283
00:50:19,591 --> 00:50:21,210
during WWII.
So you after this election and where,

1284
00:50:21,211 --> 00:50:22,420
where,
where do you line up now?

1285
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:25,930
Where are you?
Because beforehand you were kind of,

1286
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:31,050
I mean you saw the black lives matter 
thing and you talked about the issue of 

1287
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:31,050
libertarian than anything.

1288
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,320
So did you bet Gary Johnson?
I did,

1289
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:35,690
but only because he did my podcast.
Oh really?

1290
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:36,770
Yeah.
I'm like,

1291
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:38,780
you do my podcast.
I'll vote for you for president.

1292
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,300
It's deal's a deal.
Did he smoke pot and doing your podcast?

1293
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:43,520
She should've.
Should've got them high right now.

1294
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:48,521
We talked pretty sensibly.
I like Gary as a human and I think he's 

1295
00:50:48,521 --> 00:50:52,631
a good guy and I think that um,
the Aleppo things suck that fucking 

1296
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:58,091
boat,
like a goddamn torpedo when he didn't 

1297
00:50:58,091 --> 00:50:58,091
know what Aleppo is with like,
okay,

1298
00:50:58,091 --> 00:50:58,280
here's the thing.
Plays Good Pool.

1299
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,030
Most people don't know about Aleppo.
When that happened,

1300
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:03,800
every,
there was a spike in Google searches for

1301
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:06,440
Aleppo and he doesn't know what Aleppo 
isn't.

1302
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:08,120
I didn't know.
I didn't know about Aleppo.

1303
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:11,130
I knew that Syria was in a terrible,
terrible situation.

1304
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,770
I knew the Syrian refugees that are 
fleeing,

1305
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,770
I knew the bombings and who I didn't 
know the name of the city.

1306
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,450
The problem is,
you know,

1307
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:22,451
he got caught not knowing the name of 
the city and he should have known the 

1308
00:51:22,451 --> 00:51:22,451
name of the city.
Like if you asked me,

1309
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,100
you know,
uh,

1310
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:28,140
you know,
how do you think matt hume handles a 

1311
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:28,140
mighty mouse is career?
I'd be like,

1312
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:32,021
who the fuck's mad at him if I said that
I shouldn't be doing mma commentator 

1313
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:33,410
ever again,
but I'm a man.

1314
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,560
I'm a mixed martial arts commentator.
That is part of my job.

1315
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,930
If you're running for president,
it's part of your job.

1316
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,410
Know the name of the city where you 
know,

1317
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,730
the worst part was when you tried to 
cover it up like African.

1318
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,770
What is Aleppo?
Syria?

1319
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:47,870
Yes.
Yes.

1320
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,640
Got It,
got it.

1321
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,590
You said it twice.
Buying some time.

1322
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:52,520
She's like,
you just said,

1323
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,900
you know what?
I don't really know,

1324
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,150
but I'm a libertarian so it wouldn't 
even be in Aleppo.

1325
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,410
So what does it matter?
Yeah,

1326
00:51:57,411 --> 00:51:59,000
but see,
I don't buy that either,

1327
00:51:59,001 --> 00:52:04,001
man.
Once you've entangled yourself in the 

1328
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:06,491
world of politics,
foreign politics and international 

1329
00:52:06,491 --> 00:52:09,461
politics,
the idea that you're not going to be 

1330
00:52:09,461 --> 00:52:09,461
there anymore.
Well,

1331
00:52:09,461 --> 00:52:09,560
we found out what happens with that in 
Iraq.

1332
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,150
We have found out what happens with 
that.

1333
00:52:11,151 --> 00:52:14,660
In Libya you create a vacuum and that 
vacuum is filled by terrible,

1334
00:52:14,661 --> 00:52:15,610
terrible people.
Well,

1335
00:52:15,611 --> 00:52:20,611
particularly when you give them a 
timetable of when you're going to pull 

1336
00:52:20,611 --> 00:52:20,611
out.
Yeah.

1337
00:52:20,611 --> 00:52:20,611
You know,
and everyone in the right was saying,

1338
00:52:20,611 --> 00:52:20,980
well listen,
that's,

1339
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,010
that's a mistake.
No,

1340
00:52:22,011 --> 00:52:22,310
no,
no,

1341
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:23,090
this is gonna work.
Well,

1342
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:24,620
trust me,
but in his defense,

1343
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:26,290
what the fuck else do you do?
I mean,

1344
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:31,330
do you stay there,
stay there and you keep putting it in 

1345
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:31,330
there.
It's not going to light,

1346
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:31,670
bitch.
I know how to do this.

1347
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,880
Pay For at least an hour afterward.
I'll show you how to get it.

1348
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:40,160
I'm already doing it like,
man,

1349
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:44,480
we're going to suffocate the flame 
lighters,

1350
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:45,380
bro.
Yeah,

1351
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,670
modern technology.
Um,

1352
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,380
well here's something that I,
that I do think we've seen afterwards.

1353
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,330
I guess I wasn't a big trump supporter 
with that.

1354
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,920
Or you want to go down and you did say 
we can,

1355
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,980
but let's talk.
Let's talk politics.

1356
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:00,620
Let's Talk Jack Daniels with Bernie 
Sanders or whoever it is.

1357
00:53:00,621 --> 00:53:03,620
You can't line up with the black lives 
matter you all the time.

1358
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:05,660
You can line up with the pussy hat,
economics,

1359
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:08,570
the women's March all the time.
You can't line up with the antifreeze.

1360
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:10,430
Speech protesters on campus all the 
time.

1361
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,550
He can't line up with the people online 
who want a band.

1362
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:16,370
Voices of dissent all the time.
You can't line up with,

1363
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,680
we want to tax the wealthy.
Can you line up?

1364
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:23,780
Well,
the point is people like Bernie or 

1365
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:23,780
Hillary when they do that,
until you realize,

1366
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,611
hold on a second,
there's a line and I've lined up with 

1367
00:53:27,611 --> 00:53:27,611
everyone except for the rest

1368
00:53:27,611 --> 00:53:28,560
of America.
And you see that in Los Angeles.

1369
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:30,090
It's an insulated bubble of.
People don't realize.

1370
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:31,640
You know what?
There are a lot of people saying that,

1371
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,130
or New York,
whatever.

1372
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:38,550
Cities want you to relax it didn't you?
Didn't you go to Colorado one point 

1373
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,640
because he hated it.
No,

1374
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,510
I wanted to live.
I do not like the population.

1375
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,480
I do love the mountains,
right bro?

1376
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,840
I got a straight off the mountain tee 
shirt on hoyt archery.com.

1377
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:52,350
That could be in Washington.
No fucking bowhunter on that thing.

1378
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,000
Um,
I think that chickens.

1379
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:55,700
Yeah,
right.

1380
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,990
Yeah.
I don't live in Los Angeles.

1381
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,250
I live outside of Los Angeles.
Yeah.

1382
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,760
I have several locations.
And which to sleep.

1383
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,130
I think,
uh,

1384
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:09,500
I think that there's,
there's a real problem with high 

1385
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,890
population areas and that problem is,
there is two things.

1386
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:12,780
One,
there's a diffusion of responsibility.

1387
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:13,740
There's too many people.

1388
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,260
You just feel like you don't,
they don't value,

1389
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,690
you don't value each other because 
there's too many,

1390
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,840
there's everyone's there.
If you see an accident you don't pull 

1391
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:23,840
over to try to help because there's 
100,000

1392
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,200
people on the highway.
You just keep going.

1393
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,280
Yeah.
If you saw that same accident on a 

1394
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,390
single lane road in the country and you 
know,

1395
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:32,550
some cops you might pull over and help,
you know,

1396
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:35,380
you might add about New York,
New Yorkers care about each other.

1397
00:54:35,381 --> 00:54:40,381
I got you walk past the Hobo on the 
street in New York for a lot of people 

1398
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:40,381
they just ignore it because they're so 
used to it.

1399
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:41,590
They did after nine slash 11.
They love it.

1400
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,590
You know,
I went to New York after nine slash 11.

1401
00:54:43,591 --> 00:54:45,630
We filmed a fear factor there and I'll 
tell you man,

1402
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:47,260
it was a beautiful thing because there 
was,

1403
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:52,270
there was a real palpable,
like a tangible feeling of community 

1404
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:54,210
there that doesn't exist there anymore.

1405
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:55,050
No,
it's gone.

1406
00:54:55,230 --> 00:55:00,230
Also the New York that existed in 2001 
is not the New York that he is here in 

1407
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,150
2016.
No,

1408
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,090
you know,
um,

1409
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:07,340
I've had some like Judah freelander is a
friend of mine is a stand up comic and 

1410
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:07,500
he,
he was telling me,

1411
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:07,920
he's like,
dude,

1412
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:09,390
it's all bankers now.
He's like,

1413
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,730
there's no artist in New York anymore.
They can't afford it.

1414
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,280
He's like,
if you go to Brooklyn maybe,

1415
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:19,850
but in New York City the rents are so 
fucking expensive and there's so much 

1416
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,631
international money in New York.
It's like I can tell you that's flipped 

1417
00:55:23,631 --> 00:55:23,790
a little bit having when I lived there.
Um,

1418
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:27,000
the lower east side in New York City.
I lived there when I was with Fox for,

1419
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,110
well,
well there are two different stints,

1420
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:33,140
one time sleeping on couches and a one 
time this would've been 2011,

1421
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,160
maybe 2011,
2012.

1422
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,640
And the rent was cheaper in old money,
upper east side than an east village or 

1423
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,330
lower east side because that's where all
the hipsters and the artists were.

1424
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:47,690
So they don't want it to be there now in
the upper east side was seen as not 

1425
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:48,630
cool.
So I got a place that was so inexpensive

1426
00:55:48,631 --> 00:55:51,300
compared to if I wanted to live down 
downtown.

1427
00:55:51,301 --> 00:55:53,970
So that's Kinda switched.
But no one,

1428
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,700
none of the artists want to live with 
all the wasp.

1429
00:55:55,701 --> 00:56:00,701
So this is always a problem when too 
many people have too much money and 

1430
00:56:00,701 --> 00:56:01,620
they're all congregated in one area 
because then they're just annoying.

1431
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:07,080
It's annoying.
They're all trying to buy the same 

1432
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,081
fucking cars on your voice.
And Bertrand Russell short pipes and 

1433
00:56:09,841 --> 00:56:12,060
stomp on the little mat.
And I,

1434
00:56:12,061 --> 00:56:12,900
um,
yeah,

1435
00:56:12,901 --> 00:56:13,950
I think you're right.
And I think,

1436
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:15,030
uh,
I think it also,

1437
00:56:15,031 --> 00:56:20,031
I mean there's obviously this is where 
leftest tend to congregate leftist 

1438
00:56:20,031 --> 00:56:21,270
ideology in big cities.
They want you on public transportation.

1439
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:23,040
They want you to do that.
Then they don't want you riding,

1440
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,030
Bro.
No,

1441
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:24,970
they won't get well.
Bikes,

1442
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:25,540
public,
trans,

1443
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:31,020
public transport,
but certainly they want to limit what 

1444
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:31,020
kind of cars you can drive,
how far you can drive them.

1445
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:35,011
You look in any big city,
they definitely wanna reduce 

1446
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:35,011
independence and um,
there's a real art.

1447
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:36,210
Do you think that's what it really is?
No.

1448
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:39,400
They want to reduce carbon emissions.
They don't want to reduce independence.

1449
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,060
No,
I think.

1450
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:45,061
I think it's both.
It's both and less consistent than 

1451
00:56:45,061 --> 00:56:45,061
pieces.
Stop.

1452
00:56:45,061 --> 00:56:47,950
If kids say that people want you on 
buses and dependent on government,

1453
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:49,460
just like they want you on welfare,
they,

1454
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,470
the transit people don't.
Maybe some percentage of the people do.

1455
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:58,471
But if Tesla came out with some car that
you could drive across the country on 

1456
00:56:58,471 --> 00:57:01,351
one charge,
you think people would be suppressing 

1457
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:01,351
that?
They would welcome it.

1458
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:02,980
Zero emissions car that give you total 
freedom.

1459
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,260
No one's going to try to suppress that.
The issue is,

1460
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,300
is the only one?
I don't think so.

1461
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:11,710
How and why they would do is remove all 
the government subsidies that make tesla

1462
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:15,430
even remotely competitive as they this.
They should have started them a crazy.

1463
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:20,431
I'm talking about the United States 
government and the subsidies that go 

1464
00:57:20,431 --> 00:57:20,431
into a tesla,
right?

1465
00:57:20,431 --> 00:57:22,990
Prius could still be losing Toyota on 
everyone sold.

1466
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,310
But you look at the government 
subsidies,

1467
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:26,860
the government incentives for people 
don't want to buy these cars.

1468
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,030
Oh,
that's Tesla.

1469
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:29,050
Yeah,
but not a prius.

1470
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,500
That's not true either.
I know a bunch of people bought Prius is

1471
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:35,950
Prius a Brendan Schaub as a Prius.
My buddies have drives a prius.

1472
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:39,280
He's got off fucking Prius.
Has even fit in a prius and a Bentley.

1473
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,120
Well there you can.
Barely fucking.

1474
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:44,640
Big Gorilla.
He barely fits in.

1475
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,990
I would say those things handled like 
trash.

1476
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,390
There's shit cars.
Bill Burr has a prius.

1477
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,860
How about that?
And the Jaguar?

1478
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,650
Exactly it.
That's exactly what it is.

1479
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:56,040
It's the white,
the white guilt symbol in Los Angeles,

1480
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:58,750
or you can say,
I got to say that,

1481
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:01,210
but it's people that don't want to spend
a lot of money on gas.

1482
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:03,170
They bought a lot of them,
bought them in 2000.

1483
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:08,270
Now here's the thing.
If you don't want to spend a lot of 

1484
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:09,691
money on gas,
you would do the cost savings 

1485
00:58:09,691 --> 00:58:09,691
estimation.
You would see buying a used car,

1486
00:58:09,691 --> 00:58:10,840
any used car,
especially a Ford Fiesta,

1487
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:13,180
which would get more mileage and a prius
anyway.

1488
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,280
So White,
guilty.

1489
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:14,830
Um,
no.

1490
00:58:14,831 --> 00:58:18,730
It doesn't get done.
Fiesta gets more money or American small

1491
00:58:18,731 --> 00:58:20,620
cars will get over 40 miles per gallon.
Yeah,

1492
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:22,150
but a praise gets over 50.
No,

1493
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:22,990
pull it up.
Jamie.

1494
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:24,710
Motherfucker.
Let's ride.

1495
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,310
Let's say it's an eight mileage 
difference.

1496
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,600
Yeah,
but that's not what you want.

1497
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:30,310
You don't want an old car's gonna break 
down.

1498
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,770
You want a new car that's reliable.
That gets really,

1499
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:34,450
really shouldn't be enhanced with a 
Prius.

1500
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,280
That's fucking pussy.
No,

1501
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:37,060
seriously.
You don't want.

1502
00:58:37,061 --> 00:58:38,800
That's going to be tar straight into 
your lungs.

1503
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:40,150
If you inhale that and switched into 
weed,

1504
00:58:40,151 --> 00:58:41,020
you're driving me crazy.

1505
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:46,630
I'm,
oh this is so much better.

1506
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:48,460
Well,
back to the.

1507
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:49,780
Oh,
there you go.

1508
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,530
Alright,
so what's that?

1509
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:53,390
A Prius is Ford Fiesta.
Alright,

1510
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,880
so 40 highway,
29 city sun,

1511
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:58,660
40 highway.
Now pull up,

1512
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:04,560
pull up a preschool.
I have way more in the city because 

1513
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:04,560
there was a battery work here because 
it's better.

1514
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,270
Son of a bitch point sucks.
No,

1515
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:09,130
no,
that wasn't the point though.

1516
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:14,790
That was a,
that was a side trying to say that if 

1517
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:18,571
you really wanted to save money on gas,
you would get a fucking shitty old Ford 

1518
00:59:18,571 --> 00:59:19,060
Fiesta.
And that's absolutely.

1519
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:20,920
Absolutely.
Yeah,

1520
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,020
absolutely.
Son,

1521
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:26,360
are you it more in the city but all you 
want.

1522
00:59:26,361 --> 00:59:30,720
But here's the truth.
Many tens of miles per gallon.

1523
00:59:30,721 --> 00:59:35,721
You are incorrect.
If you look at the actual price of a 

1524
00:59:35,721 --> 00:59:37,571
Prius versus the best thing you can do 
for the environment is by an old beater 

1525
00:59:37,571 --> 00:59:37,571
car by an old Camaro.

1526
00:59:37,571 --> 00:59:40,130
This poorly understood that it's 
$24,000.

1527
00:59:40,131 --> 00:59:42,560
It's cheap as fuck for a car.
No,

1528
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,010
you'd be better off buying an old beater
car recycle than buying a prius.

1529
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,450
Dig Your heels in a.
You don't see the other side,

1530
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,500
you buy a Prius,
two giant non recyclable batteries.

1531
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,360
Dig Your heels,
your giant non-recyclable non recyclable

1532
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:01,370
for now,
but much like nuclear waste.

1533
01:00:01,371 --> 01:00:04,250
It's making a comeback.
You know,

1534
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,280
that they can make diamonds batteries on
a diamonds with nuclear waste now that 

1535
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,060
last thousands of years.
Give what do we want?

1536
01:00:11,061 --> 01:00:11,720
Diamonds.
Oh,

1537
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:14,420
they make batteries that have diamonds,
the nuclear waste,

1538
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,900
nuclear diamond waste batteries.
Thousands of years.

1539
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:22,990
Nuclear energy that we could be using,
but we can't be using because people 

1540
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:22,990
thought it was worse for the environment
we're using it.

1541
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:24,440
Whether people thought it was worse or 
not.

1542
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:27,920
The real issue is like the old plants 
like Fukushima,

1543
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,080
that they have huge difficulties with 
shutting down.

1544
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,840
Someone told me that is not,
you know,

1545
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:38,841
we're talking about the other day that 
someone had said that the radiation 

1546
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:38,841
levels are growing.
This business not growing,

1547
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:42,650
that the real issue is a aerosol or 
something.

1548
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:48,020
The old global warming.
Cfcs sort of noticed but not aerosols.

1549
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:50,810
What was the airborne airborne?
Uh,

1550
01:00:50,811 --> 01:00:54,050
radiation is an issue with Fukushima 
that they're monitoring it.

1551
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,250
Yeah.
It doesn't surprise me,

1552
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:58,760
but my.
My point on that one is why?

1553
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,080
Why are leftist,
for example,

1554
01:01:00,081 --> 01:01:02,860
against the sharing economy?
Why would Bernie Sanders,

1555
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,890
Bernie Sanders,
they're plastic forks just abandoned,

1556
01:01:06,891 --> 01:01:11,891
left versus right,
and tries to tell people what are the 

1557
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:16,020
innovations or the Bernie social 
ascenders against the sharing economy.

1558
01:01:16,101 --> 01:01:17,660
You can you give them a nickname?
Yeah,

1559
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:20,510
you son of a socialist.
He's a self about European socialists.

1560
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,300
Why would they be against the sharing 
hundred thousand dollars a year?

1561
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:23,980
Let's,
let's,

1562
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,430
let's stay on the ground.

1563
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:29,770
What are you telling me?
This bouncing all over it.

1564
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,880
You bring up your fucking dog again.
What about your dad is Jitsu guy not 

1565
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,610
talk about politics,
so it's hard to say.

1566
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:38,960
I don't want to talk to them.
I says,

1567
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,350
this is the point,
the sharing economy,

1568
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,380
Uber,
Uber,

1569
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:47,440
and Airbnb.
Shouldn't everyone be on board with 

1570
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:47,440
that?
What do you have?

1571
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,161
People like Bernie Sanders or Nancy 
Pelosi banning them or poor Austin 

1572
01:01:51,161 --> 01:01:52,730
politicians and constituents banning 
them from their city.

1573
01:01:52,731 --> 01:01:54,860
If we're talking about sharing 
socialism,

1574
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,630
yeah,
you can't do uber and Austin.

1575
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,820
Bernie Sanders doesn't want to uber.
AIRBNB.

1576
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:03,821
Why do you think they're doing that?
Do you think they're doing that because 

1577
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:05,891
they want taxis to survive?
I think they're doing it because just 

1578
01:02:05,891 --> 01:02:09,341
like people like to throw out this big 
conspiracy about big bankers and their 

1579
01:02:09,341 --> 01:02:09,341
own self interest,
which is true.

1580
01:02:09,341 --> 01:02:11,270
I think that people don't want to 
acknowledge that the left is beholden to

1581
01:02:11,271 --> 01:02:16,271
giant cabby unions who are punching 
people in the face in New York because 

1582
01:02:16,271 --> 01:02:17,990
Uber removes their surcharge and decides
to ignore the trump travel ban.

1583
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,250
I think they're against airbnb because

1584
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,480
they're beholden to,
for example,

1585
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,980
the culinary union who might sneak in 
the side about the trump travel ban.

1586
01:02:25,981 --> 01:02:30,981
We talked about that was that people 
weren't even road testing and Uber in 

1587
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:34,731
New York City.
They went in and they were still going 

1588
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:34,731
to the airport.
The cabbies unions in New York said,

1589
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:38,931
we're not going to go,
and so people were punching over 

1590
01:02:38,931 --> 01:02:38,931
drivers.
People getting furious about it.

1591
01:02:38,931 --> 01:02:38,931
Saying,
you're you're scams.

1592
01:02:38,931 --> 01:02:40,860
You're coming in.
Uber actually removed their surcharge.

1593
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,210
[inaudible] remember all the airport 
protests,

1594
01:02:42,211 --> 01:02:43,230
right?
It was a quagmire.

1595
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:43,890
No,
I don't.

1596
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:44,730
I don't.
Oh yeah.

1597
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:46,260
Join the airplane mode of the trump's 
travel ban.

1598
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:48,600
There were protests at all these 
different airports about that.

1599
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:48,860
Yeah.
Well,

1600
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:51,870
what does that have to do with Uber?
The point is in New York,

1601
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:55,470
the cabbies unions went on strike 
against the travel ban,

1602
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,840
right?
Uber's going in weren't clear,

1603
01:02:57,841 --> 01:02:59,220
and they're moving their surcharge.

1604
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:04,460
Well,
if we're talking about the sharing 

1605
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:05,721
economy,
if we're talking about bringing in 

1606
01:03:05,721 --> 01:03:05,721
refugees and resettling them against 
people's will,

1607
01:03:05,721 --> 01:03:05,820
right?
Because we want to be compassionate.

1608
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:07,470
We'll just take that and say,
okay,

1609
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:09,450
instead of resettling refugees against 
somebody's will,

1610
01:03:09,451 --> 01:03:14,451
because you want to share what about 
somebody deciding to share their car at 

1611
01:03:14,451 --> 01:03:17,580
an agreed upon service or share their 
house and the the left,

1612
01:03:17,581 --> 01:03:20,820
the political left has fought against 
that vehemently.

1613
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,940
It is inconsistent.
They were band.

1614
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,550
Who is this day?
Okay.

1615
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:29,850
So the board or he polosi.
Elizabeth Warren.

1616
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:32,970
What they want to do is either get uber 
banned in cities,

1617
01:03:32,971 --> 01:03:37,971
as you see in cities like Austin or in 
cities in Europe or they want to make 

1618
01:03:37,971 --> 01:03:39,180
sure that unions,
that caveat is either get first,

1619
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:41,580
right?
Or that Uber Hires these union workers.

1620
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:42,120
Okay.
Well,

1621
01:03:42,121 --> 01:03:43,890
I have,
I definitely have an issue with that,

1622
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,660
so let's pull up that.

1623
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:50,070
Pull up that story that Bernie Sanders 
is in favor of banning uber,

1624
01:03:50,071 --> 01:03:51,390
Bernie Sanders,
Uber,

1625
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:56,780
and let's,
let's break that down and unpack it 

1626
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:59,301
because I think when something comes 
along that's better and it fucks with a 

1627
01:03:59,701 --> 01:04:04,701
business that is worse,
the better things should win because 

1628
01:04:04,701 --> 01:04:04,810
that's progress.
Sure.

1629
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:08,250
I think uber is progress.
I think lyft is progress.

1630
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:13,251
I think what lyft is doing and what 
these these programs are doing where you

1631
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:18,501
have an application on your phone,
you can turn it on and off anytime you 

1632
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:18,501
want.
You can work anytime you want,

1633
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:21,960
as long as they certify and test you and
run it.

1634
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:25,530
Make sure you're not a crazy person as 
long as they know where you are at every

1635
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:30,531
time.
They can actually monitor your location 

1636
01:04:30,531 --> 01:04:31,170
through gps,
which they can and everybody saves money

1637
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,630
and the people who drive the car make 
money.

1638
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:35,970
Like you can make like 35 bucks an hour 
doing that.

1639
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:39,510
Why wouldn't you rather do that?
If you have a car like a prius that gets

1640
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,300
50 fucking eight miles to the gallon,
wouldn't you rather do that?

1641
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:47,510
So I'm in favor of 100 percent in 
progress and I think that anybody that 

1642
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:50,811
opposes that because somehow or another 
it's going to challenge other people's 

1643
01:04:50,811 --> 01:04:50,811
jobs.
Right?

1644
01:04:50,811 --> 01:04:52,680
When it comes to something like uber 
versus cab,

1645
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,720
in my opinion,
this is pretty black and white.

1646
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:59,750
This is a new technology,
a disruptive technology that benefits a 

1647
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,070
lot of individual users.
Hence it's good.

1648
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:07,100
Well also benefits the middle class more
than anybody and there's no union for 

1649
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:07,710
Uber drivers.
That's a big problem.

1650
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:10,800
No lobbying and there's no money that 
goes to politician.

1651
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:12,840
Well that's a big problem.
So I'm not aware of this.

1652
01:05:12,841 --> 01:05:14,910
You're more balls deep in politics than 
I am.

1653
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:19,911
So let's.
Jamie's going to pull up a story and 

1654
01:05:19,911 --> 01:05:19,911
we're going to figure out what

1655
01:05:19,911 --> 01:05:23,040
the fuck is wrong with Bernie Sanders.
Take on it from an individual point of 

1656
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,040
view.
Yeah,

1657
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,710
or you can look up.
I mean,

1658
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:28,711
you can even look up European cities 
that have banded are awesome and I know 

1659
01:05:28,711 --> 01:05:31,600
it was a huge issue in London.
I remember watching those cab drivers 

1660
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,621
that had decided to block streets.
They decided to shut their cars off in 

1661
01:05:34,621 --> 01:05:35,130
the middle of the street and literally 
stop cars from passing.

1662
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:38,110
People had to go way around them and it 
was a huge issue.

1663
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:43,240
The reason the term political left and 
right and matters right now to me anyway

1664
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:48,420
and matter to some people,
but the reason it matters to me is 

1665
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:48,420
because you do look at one side of the 
political spectrum right now and I think

1666
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:52,891
the line's been pretty clear in this 
last election where there's an 

1667
01:05:52,891 --> 01:05:55,531
ideological divide and where one is 
deliberately looking at marginalizing 

1668
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:59,731
and targeting and dividing victimized 
groups and they do so and ignore other 

1669
01:05:59,731 --> 01:06:04,021
groups of people who are victimized as a
result of them complaining about 

1670
01:06:04,021 --> 01:06:04,021
victimization.

1671
01:06:04,021 --> 01:06:04,120
Okay?
Like what this is.

1672
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,720
That's very vague.
So let going to give you want a concrete

1673
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:12,721
example.
Let's find this with Bernie Sanders may 

1674
01:06:12,721 --> 01:06:14,650
go into this thought as Janice guidance 
on what he was trying to find a quote 

1675
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:16,680
about what he had,
so here's about what I guess he has some

1676
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:21,730
serious problems with serious problems 
with popular mobile ride hailing 

1677
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:24,040
services.
Uber speaking with Bloomberg,

1678
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:29,041
the Democratic presidential candidate 
contender rather called the service 

1679
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:32,761
unregulated,
waiting into one of the most closely 

1680
01:06:32,761 --> 01:06:35,461
watched economic debates of the 2016 
race workers on demand at on demand 

1681
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:38,440
economy.
Companies like Uber,

1682
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,700
Airbnb,
or Lyft,

1683
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:44,701
are considered independent contractors 
and therefore I do not receive the 

1684
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:46,090
benefits and protections afforded to 
fulltime employees.

1685
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:48,100
Okay.
So I could see that,

1686
01:06:48,101 --> 01:06:50,230
but they do make more money,
right?

1687
01:06:50,231 --> 01:06:51,370
Isn't that correct?
Yeah.

1688
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,170
Well they don't.
They don't have to pay a huge commission

1689
01:06:53,171 --> 01:06:58,171
to the cabbies union and they're totally
independent and they have their own car 

1690
01:06:58,171 --> 01:06:58,171
and they make more money.

1691
01:06:58,171 --> 01:06:59,040
Don't mean is that true?
Maybe.

1692
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,310
Let's make sure that that is true.
It doesn't matter if it's true,

1693
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:06,600
but let's just have the choice to just 
google uber drivers make more than car 

1694
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:11,251
companies versus how much uber makes 
from their drivers because that's the 

1695
01:07:11,251 --> 01:07:14,851
real issue.
Like say Uber as a company and they're 

1696
01:07:14,851 --> 01:07:17,581
pumping out all these drivers and then 
making shit tons of money and then 

1697
01:07:17,581 --> 01:07:19,420
they're not given the drivers enough.
Then given the uncertainty,

1698
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:24,990
I think they take a much smaller 
commission and then the cab driver's 

1699
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:24,990
license.
I don't have enough in front of me,

1700
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:26,410
reiterate.
I'm pro uber 100 percent.

1701
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,990
I have a friend of mine is actually a 
big wig at Uber.

1702
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,920
I think it's great.
I think even if I wasn't what's matter 

1703
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,200
this how uber fails to prove its drivers
make more than tax post that's happened 

1704
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,690
in post those sons of bitches.

1705
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,090
That's the blade.
You know,

1706
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:47,100
they feel the need to be defensive or 
they failed to prove how they failed to 

1707
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:47,100
prove.
What does that mean?

1708
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:50,050
I don't know.
Claim and Huffington post can't disprove

1709
01:07:50,051 --> 01:07:55,051
it,
but they're saying uber is failed to 

1710
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:55,051
prove it,
so this isn't going to help that crowd.

1711
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:58,441
Or read the fucking quotes going crazy 
and defend your right wing,

1712
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,020
right wing,
God,

1713
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:07,030
Time Dot Com.
Then instead having that beer bearson 

1714
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:07,360
time.com.
Oh,

1715
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:09,850
Uber reveals how much is drivers really 
earned?

1716
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:14,851
Sort of.
Uber has long said the drivers get paid 

1717
01:08:14,851 --> 01:08:16,230
more than traditional cabbies,
but do they driver surveys,

1718
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:19,310
strikes and class action lawsuit 
suggests otherwise.

1719
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,100
Most recently.
Buzzfeed.

1720
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,780
Is that okay?
Is it okay if it's bud?

1721
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:24,630
Is that too left wing you?
Fuck yeah.

1722
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,380
Buzz feed is fake news.
I mean your fat.

1723
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:28,430
Those estimates,
buzzfeed,

1724
01:08:28,431 --> 01:08:32,600
you fake estimate that terrible trauma 
impression that drivers in Denver,

1725
01:08:32,601 --> 01:08:36,080
Detroit,
and Houston make less than 13 point two,

1726
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:37,610
five cents an hour.

1727
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,400
$13,
twenty five cents an hour after expenses

1728
01:08:40,401 --> 01:08:42,800
using calculations based on the more 
than a million trips.

1729
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:43,490
Well,
that's not good.

1730
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:48,910
This spring,
uber was hit with two class action 

1731
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:51,281
lawsuits from drivers in Florida and 
Illinois who seek to recover unpaid 

1732
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:55,730
overtime wages and other expenses.
This is after the company.

1733
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:00,760
This is our shitty.
Now we have one Shitty TV that can't 

1734
01:09:01,611 --> 01:09:04,280
handle an htmi cable and it cuts out 
every minute and a half.

1735
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,920
We have one of those when Blah,
blah,

1736
01:09:06,921 --> 01:09:07,220
blah,
blah,

1737
01:09:07,221 --> 01:09:07,520
blah,
blah,

1738
01:09:07,521 --> 01:09:09,500
blah who seek to recover unpaid 
overtime.

1739
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:14,710
Jesus Christ,
unpaid overtime wages and other 

1740
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:17,741
expenses.
This is after the company paid 

1741
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:18,890
$100,000,000
to settle similar lawsuits in California

1742
01:09:18,891 --> 01:09:19,880
and Massachusetts.
Okay.

1743
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:25,090
Yeah.
So Massachusetts big union strong if 

1744
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:27,370
they have lawsuits and if there is a law
suit that does make sense enough where a

1745
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:32,300
judge decides that they're going to rule
against Uber.

1746
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,760
Okay.
But that's,

1747
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,570
I mean,
I don't know the law.

1748
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:36,860
Do you,
do,

1749
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:39,770
you know,
it depends on a right to work state,

1750
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:45,070
but wouldn't you assume that the lawyers
and the judges in Massachusetts would 

1751
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:50,051
make a strong enough case where they 
would show the legality of it to the 

1752
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:51,410
point where it wouldn't lose $100 or 
$100,000,000

1753
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:52,610
lawsuit?
No,

1754
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:54,950
I wouldn't assume.
Do you know anything about the lawsuit?

1755
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:55,680
Well,
I.

1756
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,880
here's what I would know,
whether it's a right to work state or 

1757
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,461
not and that will determine the lawsuit 
and that's why people like Bernie 

1758
01:10:03,461 --> 01:10:03,461
Sanders and that's why people.
Oh Geez,

1759
01:10:03,461 --> 01:10:04,160
what happened there?
You opened that too fast.

1760
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,530
Just go do it like you did the pilot 
scared good enough.

1761
01:10:09,531 --> 01:10:11,180
And Bro,
I'm so.

1762
01:10:11,181 --> 01:10:12,530
It depends if it's a right to work state
or not.

1763
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:13,640
I don't care.
Right.

1764
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:14,990
They make less than cab drivers.

1765
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:15,590
I don't care.
Well,

1766
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:20,591
let's eliminate people.
What is the difference between a right 

1767
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:21,440
to work state effectively means you 
don't have to join a union means you can

1768
01:10:21,441 --> 01:10:24,650
work without being a part of the labor 
union and determine the case.

1769
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:29,980
Just for example.
That's what when we do hidden camera 

1770
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:29,980
videos,
we have to make sure that it's a two,

1771
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,370
a one party consent state as opposed to 
a two party consent state.

1772
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:32,450
Right.
Like Nevada,

1773
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:34,040
when they used to do this prank call 
shows,

1774
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:35,860
they would do like.
You remember crank anchors?

1775
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,310
Yeah.
They would do it in Nevada,

1776
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,110
right?
Because he calls.

1777
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:40,190
Lorna is a one party consent state.
No,

1778
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:43,370
it's too well in Nevada and California 
is one.

1779
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,830
What do you mean California?
When,

1780
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,270
again,
the definition wrong,

1781
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:48,950
but I'm thinking is we both have to 
agree.

1782
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:49,580
Is that true?
Yeah.

1783
01:10:49,581 --> 01:10:54,581
Yeah.
They will do it in Nevada instead of 

1784
01:10:54,581 --> 01:10:54,581
California.

1785
01:10:54,581 --> 01:10:54,581
Right.
That's what I'm saying.

1786
01:10:54,581 --> 01:10:54,581
Right in Nevada,
you only like,

1787
01:10:54,581 --> 01:10:55,600
you can call me up a prank.
Me and not doing it.

1788
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,130
I wouldn't have to agree.
Right.

1789
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,060
That might've changed.
It might change.

1790
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:01,130
For example,
in Michigan it was really controversial.

1791
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:06,131
It was a one party consent state that 
depending on the judge read as a two 

1792
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:10,001
party consent state.
So that's really scary because you can 

1793
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:10,001
be in the clear,
right,

1794
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:12,010
we recorded a prank call or we found 
some kind of corruption and it should be

1795
01:11:12,011 --> 01:11:17,011
legal.
There's a little wiggle room where they 

1796
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:19,371
can say,
actually this isn't legal and you 

1797
01:11:19,371 --> 01:11:19,371
committed a felony.
So that's a problem with that.

1798
01:11:19,371 --> 01:11:21,120
Um,
so in these right to work states,

1799
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:24,810
um,
when you have this uber situation,

1800
01:11:24,811 --> 01:11:29,811
is the issue that it's taking cabs out 
of business or is the issue that they 

1801
01:11:30,241 --> 01:11:35,241
are not paying people enough and they're
taking cabs out of business so that 

1802
01:11:35,241 --> 01:11:39,851
people like the or cab drivers,
if they switched over to becoming uber 

1803
01:11:39,851 --> 01:11:43,851
drivers,
they would actually lose money because 

1804
01:11:43,851 --> 01:11:45,090
these companies aren't regulated so they
don't have to pay insurance,

1805
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:45,780
health insurance.

1806
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,640
I mean,
that seems like what the issue is,

1807
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:52,641
right?
That's what they would say the issues 

1808
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:52,641
are.
So it's not true.

1809
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:52,641
Well,
no,

1810
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:52,641
it's not necessarily true.
And again,

1811
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:53,460
that depends on the state.
So first off,

1812
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,050
I would want to clarify just people 
listening.

1813
01:11:55,051 --> 01:11:56,580
It would not be the right to work 
states.

1814
01:11:56,581 --> 01:11:58,350
The right to work states would be fine,
right?

1815
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:01,140
I'm a right to work state means I have 
the right to say,

1816
01:12:01,141 --> 01:12:02,310
Hey,
do you want to work for this amount?

1817
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:06,240
And you have the right to say yes or non
right to work above minimum wage.

1818
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:07,320
Everybody's cool.
Yeah.

1819
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:09,180
As long as they're as cool as you can 
be,

1820
01:12:09,181 --> 01:12:09,470
right?
Yep.

1821
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:12,300
And report is a non right.
Towards stage is when,

1822
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:15,300
depending on the profession,
if there is an established union in that

1823
01:12:15,301 --> 01:12:17,520
profession,
you can't work outside of that union.

1824
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:18,420
Right?
How's that?

1825
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:23,430
Is that the case with trades like 
plumbing being a carpenter?

1826
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:24,960
Generally repair.
Yeah.

1827
01:12:24,961 --> 01:12:27,120
Generally speaking,
it's auto repair that they have a union.

1828
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:28,620
Uh,
it depends on the state,

1829
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:33,710
depends on the state,
but she'll son and actually would have 

1830
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:33,710
some stories about his dad being in the,
uh,

1831
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:34,560
the plumber's union.
He had some stories about that.

1832
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:36,090
Vince Vaughn and some funny stories 
about that,

1833
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:38,370
he's told actually when he worked at his
dad's like papermill,

1834
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,630
um,
but,

1835
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:41,190
but to go back to it again,
first off,

1836
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,250
I don't care if someone agrees to this 
price and the service,

1837
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:49,280
I believe that's a marketplace of ideas 
and services and you have the right to 

1838
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,060
do it and I have the right to provide 
those services.

1839
01:12:51,061 --> 01:12:53,820
Now if Uber is doing a poor job,
thank God there's lift,

1840
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,770
right?
Because there's some competition there,

1841
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:57,480
but if the government steps in and says,
no,

1842
01:12:57,481 --> 01:13:02,481
you have to use the cabbies,
unions will even then you can 

1843
01:13:02,481 --> 01:13:05,391
artificially increased wages at the 
expense of the taxpayer who now has to 

1844
01:13:05,391 --> 01:13:05,391
pay more for a taxi ride.

1845
01:13:05,391 --> 01:13:10,010
So I don't care.
I think that people should be able to 

1846
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:10,010
make their own decisions if they want to
do uber,

1847
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,790
if they want to rent out their house.
And airbnb.

1848
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:17,060
And I don't think that Nancy Pelosi in 
the bay area representing our district 

1849
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:17,060
should have any say in whether I can 
read.

1850
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,720
Well,
I agree with you 100 percent on that.

1851
01:13:18,721 --> 01:13:23,721
And I think there's also a real problem 
with people resisting change because 

1852
01:13:23,721 --> 01:13:25,920
technologically influenced changes 
coming at such a high rate.

1853
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:28,650
There's no way you can put a finger in 
all the holes in the dam.

1854
01:13:28,651 --> 01:13:33,651
It's just you can't do it.
There's too many things that are 

1855
01:13:33,651 --> 01:13:36,171
happening.
They're going to change the way we 

1856
01:13:36,171 --> 01:13:36,171
communicate,
change the way we do business,

1857
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:39,180
change everything from top to bottom.
You're not going to be able to stop it.

1858
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:41,490
So anytime we try to stop something like
an Uber,

1859
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:45,930
the only thing that I think is that who 
you got to figure out where's the,

1860
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,690
how's the money being distributed,
is that fair?

1861
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:51,090
And if it's not fair,
what's the,

1862
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:56,120
what's the solution?
Because it's a solution alert people to 

1863
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,950
what the actual numbers are and let it 
all sorted itself out.

1864
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:04,040
Or is it passing regulation?
I'm a firm believer that the less 

1865
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,090
regulation you have,
the better.

1866
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:07,870
Right?
And that's what songs,

1867
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,260
it's not like environmental pollution 
type shit,

1868
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,140
the invisible hand write,
the more that moves the market.

1869
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:19,500
Um,
I certainly believe that the market is 

1870
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,941
more efficient at regulating itself.
Then the government creating a monopoly 

1871
01:14:20,941 --> 01:14:23,680
will also because unions can be 
influenced and when you get large groups

1872
01:14:23,681 --> 01:14:28,681
of people together,
I think it's good because like what a 

1873
01:14:28,681 --> 01:14:29,950
union can do is they can say,
you know,

1874
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,000
hey,
we're going to stand strong when I got 

1875
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:35,000
to let these people take advantage of us
like some sort of slave labor factory in

1876
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,220
the Middle East or wherever the fuck it 
is.

1877
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:36,930
We're gonna,
we're gonna.

1878
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,760
Figure out a way to.
You can,

1879
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,800
if you work here,
you're going to get an honest wage and 

1880
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,550
I'm 100 percent with that.
The problem is that you get giant groups

1881
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:51,901
of people that you can't go against.
Someone's going to be in control of 

1882
01:14:51,901 --> 01:14:55,831
those giant notion that that's no 
different than being the mayor of a city

1883
01:14:56,051 --> 01:15:01,051
or the leader of a country.
No different than being beholden to 

1884
01:15:01,051 --> 01:15:04,630
Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan.
And if you look at the top political 

1885
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:04,660
donors,
you can bring it up from open secrets.

1886
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:09,661
If you look at the top 20,
it's like 16 out of the top 20 are big 

1887
01:15:09,661 --> 01:15:12,331
unions.
So that's this idea that it's big banks 

1888
01:15:12,331 --> 01:15:12,331
and the Koch brothers and energy 
companies,

1889
01:15:12,331 --> 01:15:16,640
no one wields more influence in American
politics today than big unions 

1890
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:21,031
particularly come into the party because
it's power because they can influence 

1891
01:15:21,031 --> 01:15:24,301
the people that are,
can also take cues from you give 100 

1892
01:15:24,301 --> 01:15:24,301
percent of Democrats and you have no 
say,

1893
01:15:24,301 --> 01:15:28,680
well,
it's one of the big contributors to the 

1894
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:28,680
war against drugs.

1895
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:32,040
One of the big things that's happening 
in this country is the prison guard 

1896
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,671
unions have spent money to ensure that 
innocuous things like marijuana or they 

1897
01:15:37,271 --> 01:15:42,271
stay illegal because if they stay 
illegal then they keep their jobs like 

1898
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:45,580
they've literally fought for that.
Like fought to keep more people in cages

1899
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:48,580
because that would earn them more money.
I mean that's really what it is.

1900
01:15:48,581 --> 01:15:51,010
We break it down to black and white and 
it's.

1901
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:56,270
Did you just make a joke about the 
discriminatory prison system in the 

1902
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:56,270
United States?
That was cold.

1903
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:58,240
I didn't say black and white because I'm
at black and white people I met.

1904
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:00,640
It could have been black and white 
matters.

1905
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:05,700
The reality of the situation is that 
prison guard unions are spending money 

1906
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:09,670
and using their influence to ensure it 
didn't work.

1907
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:11,190
Influential,
influential.

1908
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:16,200
I'm like from south off that edge to 
ensure that marijuana stays illegal and 

1909
01:16:16,241 --> 01:16:18,310
the reason why they're doing that 
because they profit off of it,

1910
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:21,040
so that's not an altruistic ideal.

1911
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,650
That's not someone who cares about the 
people that they represent.

1912
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,840
That's not someone who cares about their
community as a whole,

1913
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:29,530
that someone is looking out for their 
best interests in a way that is negative

1914
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:31,620
towards the general population.
With you and I,

1915
01:16:31,621 --> 01:16:36,621
I think that's where the wool was pulled
over people's eyes with people like 

1916
01:16:36,621 --> 01:16:36,621
Bernie will.
He's from the people.

1917
01:16:36,621 --> 01:16:37,390
He's never gotten big donors.
That's actually not true.

1918
01:16:37,391 --> 01:16:42,391
If you look at the collective donations 
from union members and from union 

1919
01:16:42,391 --> 01:16:45,001
organizations and when you look at that,
and what bothers me is when people 

1920
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:48,031
follow the money trail and only one side
and act as though the political left is 

1921
01:16:48,031 --> 01:16:49,720
on beholden to people.
That's the big point,

1922
01:16:49,721 --> 01:16:53,620
what you just said on one side,
because I think you can see the benefits

1923
01:16:53,621 --> 01:16:58,621
in unions as well.
You could see the benefits and 

1924
01:16:58,621 --> 01:17:00,901
protecting wages and making sure that 
people get insurance and making sure 

1925
01:17:00,901 --> 01:17:01,090
that people live a good life.

1926
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,160
That like if you're going to work for 
this company,

1927
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:05,200
you're going to be well compensated and 
you're going to.

1928
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:10,440
There's going to be an agreement between
the workers and the people that run the 

1929
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:14,471
company.
There's a problem with that and the 

1930
01:17:14,471 --> 01:17:16,271
problem with that is,
but there's not always a problem with 

1931
01:17:16,271 --> 01:17:16,271
that.
There is occasionally sometimes.

1932
01:17:16,271 --> 01:17:16,650
No,
there's the,

1933
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:18,170
that's the rule rather than the 
exception.

1934
01:17:18,171 --> 01:17:19,520
And I talked about this,
the,

1935
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,190
the Walmart CEO for example,
makes $19 million,

1936
01:17:22,191 --> 01:17:23,780
right?
People are curious about that.

1937
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:28,781
Well,
Walmart employs two point 5 million 

1938
01:17:28,781 --> 01:17:28,781
people.
One point 5 million people a full time.

1939
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:31,510
So he had that.
He's getting less than than uh,

1940
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:33,560
well,
if you add up all the workers,

1941
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:38,561
not the full time workers will be less 
than $10 per person he's employing and 

1942
01:17:38,561 --> 01:17:40,190
providing an active living.
So when you have workers who say,

1943
01:17:40,191 --> 01:17:41,750
well,
he is 19 million,

1944
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:43,550
that's more than I have,
I have no million,

1945
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,290
19 is 19 more millions.

1946
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,390
These people,
they pick an arbitrary number.

1947
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,880
That's what Bernie Sanders we're doing 
with the debate with Ted Cruz,

1948
01:17:49,881 --> 01:17:54,881
whether you like them or not,
it was such a floor mopping because 

1949
01:17:54,881 --> 01:17:57,731
Bernie Sanders dealt with these phantom 
fears and again tried to victimize 

1950
01:17:57,731 --> 01:18:02,081
groups and marginalized groups.
In my point that I was talking about 

1951
01:18:02,081 --> 01:18:02,081
there is,
for example,

1952
01:18:02,081 --> 01:18:05,561
we talked about the victimized groups 
and marginalized groups who don't have 

1953
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:05,561
insurance in the country,
right?

1954
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:06,800
It was 40 something thousand.
Most of them were young people who chose

1955
01:18:06,801 --> 01:18:11,801
not to buy insurance.
So now you can stay on your parent's 

1956
01:18:11,801 --> 01:18:11,801
insurance till 26.
There you go.

1957
01:18:11,801 --> 01:18:15,581
We bought some votes because you talk 
about them and they're getting more 

1958
01:18:15,581 --> 01:18:18,131
affordable insurance now.
And now the play is we're going to take 

1959
01:18:18,131 --> 01:18:18,131
all these people off of insurance.
Okay?

1960
01:18:18,131 --> 01:18:19,340
So we're talking about that victimized 
group.

1961
01:18:19,341 --> 01:18:24,341
People who didn't buy insurance.
But what about the people who have seen 

1962
01:18:24,341 --> 01:18:24,341
their premiums go up?

1963
01:18:24,341 --> 01:18:25,490
Hardworking Americans?
Forty something percent,

1964
01:18:25,491 --> 01:18:28,610
24 percent on average in certain states.
Forty six percent,

1965
01:18:28,611 --> 01:18:30,980
sometimes 60 something percent of the 
premiums have gone up.

1966
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:36,250
Why don't we talk about the 
ramifications of the everyday Americans 

1967
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:39,190
who now can no longer afford healthcare 
insurance and don't qualify for a 

1968
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:41,180
government subsidy.
And if you look at the trend,

1969
01:18:41,181 --> 01:18:44,090
I will argue this and I'll dig my heels 
and if I feel I have to,

1970
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:49,350
the political left seeks to divide and 
conquer and find for sure the most 

1971
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,130
victimized group of that day.
W W how so?

1972
01:18:52,131 --> 01:18:55,280
Like what do you mean the most most 
victimized group of that day to do what?

1973
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:56,000
Well,
I think,

1974
01:18:56,001 --> 01:18:57,260
well,
like right now for example,

1975
01:18:57,261 --> 01:18:59,660
I'm just using that as an example 
because you said a concrete example with

1976
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:04,810
obamacare.
So right now it's these people aren't 

1977
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:04,810
gonna be able to afford insurance?
Well,

1978
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:08,171
there are times people cycle too far 
away from unions because you were way 

1979
01:19:08,331 --> 01:19:09,880
out into the obamacare pool.

1980
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,220
Well,
no,

1981
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,080
because we were talking about that deep 
and long.

1982
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:12,860
No,
no it's not.

1983
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:17,920
It's really not obamacare's subsidized,
technically healthcare sub costs of 

1984
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,100
other taxpayers who couldn't afford it 
and now they can't afford to live.

1985
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:26,290
Let's start from the beginning because 
you went way out there and you started 

1986
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:28,280
out with the CEO.
I went out there and have Alex Jones and

1987
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:33,290
I went out there.
When you went out there in terms of you 

1988
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:35,621
covered so many different things before 
anybody could address either one of 

1989
01:19:35,621 --> 01:19:35,930
them.
You have to like slow down and like take

1990
01:19:35,931 --> 01:19:40,931
it point by point.
You said that this guy makes so much 

1991
01:19:40,931 --> 01:19:41,930
money that if everybody gave him 10 
bucks,

1992
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,900
like why should they give him 10 bucks?
Here's the thing,

1993
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:50,140
like what is this guy doing?
Single biggest employer of people in 

1994
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:50,840
what?
He's just a guy who works for them.

1995
01:19:50,841 --> 01:19:53,570
He doesn't even own it.
Why is this guy makes so much money?

1996
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,760
I'm not saying you should.
I'm not saying he shouldn't.

1997
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:59,000
He should make that much money,
but why defend that?

1998
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:00,560
Why defend that?
Why not?

1999
01:20:00,561 --> 01:20:02,220
Why not have.
See that's like,

2000
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,670
can I get a raise?
And they say no.

2001
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:07,530
And he'd go away.
That guy makes $15,000,000

2002
01:20:07,531 --> 01:20:08,100
a year and it doesn't

2003
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,690
even work.
What does he do?

2004
01:20:09,691 --> 01:20:11,390
He sits behind there.
A lot of punches.

2005
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,500
What you just said,
there were a lot of assumptions.

2006
01:20:13,501 --> 01:20:15,990
He doesn't work.
Why does that guy make that much money?

2007
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,060
How much?
Obviously,

2008
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:22,830
who sees this factory?
This gutters need to have a real job 

2009
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:23,880
that's much driven around a fucking 
limousine.

2010
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,280
He gets $50 million.
We can't get a raise.

2011
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:27,930
That's my point.
Well,

2012
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:30,810
you can just tell them this is too much,
but don't you think,

2013
01:20:30,811 --> 01:20:33,690
and this is what I think.
If that guy really does make that amount

2014
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:38,691
of money,
he's probably like how the fuck am I 

2015
01:20:38,691 --> 01:20:40,220
pulling and extracting numbers from some
system by his choice thing.

2016
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:45,230
So at all ones and Zeros and moving 
things around and making sure that 

2017
01:20:45,230 --> 01:20:48,261
profit margin trees and he gets a piece 
of that and he just live in like a 

2018
01:20:48,261 --> 01:20:51,921
fucking baller on a yacht,
a golden bikini with a bottle of Dom 

2019
01:20:51,921 --> 01:20:53,220
Perignon,
a cross dresser now,

2020
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:57,050
and seven fun is fucking gold.

2021
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,740
Made $15,000,000
this year.

2022
01:20:58,741 --> 01:21:03,741
You can do whatever the fuck he wants,
but there's there's room for debate as 

2023
01:21:03,741 --> 01:21:08,691
to what a job is worth and good job on 
my show of having people on or disagree 

2024
01:21:09,061 --> 01:21:11,930
in engaging in those debates.
We don't just say here,

2025
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:14,540
just about this subject right here.
I think there's.

2026
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:19,320
How do I make an assumption there's room
to soon how much a job is worth.

2027
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:20,370
Yes,
there is room to debate,

2028
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:25,430
so if determined by the value of the 
company and the services rendered not 

2029
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:27,180
some arbitrary number because Bernie 
sanders throws out a percentage point,

2030
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,220
so I'm not saying that he's right.
I'm just saying,

2031
01:21:29,221 --> 01:21:32,190
well,
I think it's totally within the interest

2032
01:21:32,191 --> 01:21:37,191
of all the people that work for a 
company that are critical to this 

2033
01:21:37,191 --> 01:21:37,740
company actually working to figure out 
like,

2034
01:21:37,741 --> 01:21:39,150
hey,
how much should we get for this?

2035
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:40,170
How much do they get?

2036
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:41,820
Well,
one guy's getting $15,

2037
01:21:41,821 --> 01:21:46,821
million bucks and the other guys getting
$15 an hour and you got to like this 

2038
01:21:46,821 --> 01:21:47,400
guy.
If this guy doesn't work,

2039
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:49,620
this guy doesn't get any money.
These people have to work.

2040
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:54,650
If they didn't work,
the CEO would make $0 because there 

2041
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:55,170
would be no profit.
So someone has to work.

2042
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:00,440
So I don't think it's outside the realm 
of rational discourse to discuss how 

2043
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:03,240
much a person should make to be a CEO.
No,

2044
01:22:03,241 --> 01:22:05,400
I don't think it's outside the realm of 
rational discourse.

2045
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:10,490
Um,
I do think people are wrong when they 

2046
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:10,490
say,
for example,

2047
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:10,500
to to take your argument how much a CEO 
should make.

2048
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:12,320
I think that's silly.
You shouldn't be to determine that.

2049
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,440
Just.
I don't think you should either.

2050
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:18,441
Just like,
I don't think you'd be able to say $15 

2051
01:22:18,441 --> 01:22:18,441
an hour.
Look,

2052
01:22:18,441 --> 01:22:19,260
I think if somebody is,
if some super baller,

2053
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:24,650
you know,
fucking steve jobs type character comes 

2054
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:27,831
in and starts running a company and all 
of a sudden it goes blockbuster through 

2055
01:22:27,831 --> 01:22:27,900
the roof and becomes apple.

2056
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:33,530
I don't think you should be able to say 
that guy doesn't deserve way more money 

2057
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:34,650
than the average person goes fucking.
Of course he does.

2058
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:39,651
Yeah.
That guy is an obsessed genius who's 

2059
01:22:39,651 --> 01:22:39,651
making this.
Okay.

2060
01:22:39,651 --> 01:22:40,980
Exactly.
Who does determine?

2061
01:22:40,981 --> 01:22:45,981
I think the market does,
but it's an interrelationship between 

2062
01:22:45,981 --> 01:22:46,230
the people who are.
This is Bernie Sanders point of view.

2063
01:22:46,231 --> 01:22:51,231
I would imagine the people that don't 
have a say that people that are making 

2064
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:56,811
the least amount of money,
they're the easiest to replace and 

2065
01:22:56,811 --> 01:22:58,380
they're the ones that are worried about 
being treated fairly well.

2066
01:22:58,381 --> 01:22:59,160
First off,
I would say,

2067
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:04,280
you know,
heart exactly what little I do and 

2068
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:04,680
that's where they get mad.
They say you're a conservative,

2069
01:23:04,681 --> 01:23:06,280
therefore you don't care about poor 
people.

2070
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:11,510
I'm not talking about poor people.
I was sleeping out of an 82 dots and 

2071
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:12,230
when I first lived in Los Angeles,
so I'm,

2072
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,260
I cared about myself,
let's put it that way.

2073
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:16,580
I used to be in high school,
but I want to talk to those folks.

2074
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:23,930
But that's,
that's the thing that they'll say is 

2075
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:23,930
right.
Attributed motive.

2076
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:23,930
And I think,
and I think we both met.

2077
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:24,280
I think you don't do it.
I don't do it.

2078
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:25,780
Um,
I don't attribute node of.

2079
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:30,960
I don't say will you do this because you
hate poor people when you do this 

2080
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,471
because.
But you do have to look at the numbers 

2081
01:23:34,471 --> 01:23:34,471
and you look at a certain point when 
people say they're underrepresented,

2082
01:23:34,471 --> 01:23:34,870
they have no voice.
Well,

2083
01:23:34,871 --> 01:23:37,720
that's not true with union workers.
They have a huge voice if huge political

2084
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,880
influence.
These people don't not have a voice.

2085
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:42,520
Especially they have the payment 
industry.

2086
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:43,990
They have a,
you know,

2087
01:23:43,991 --> 01:23:46,930
the entire music industry has been so 
far left for so long,

2088
01:23:46,931 --> 01:23:48,630
pushing for these same ideas that 
country.

2089
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:50,920
A lot of those people are actually 
pretty fuck.

2090
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:53,530
Kid Rock was just talking about how most
of them are pretty far left.

2091
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:58,590
Country Music is not far left,
so you're taking an extremely poor 

2092
01:23:58,590 --> 01:24:00,220
country the fuck out of dodge to stop 
you remove country.

2093
01:24:00,221 --> 01:24:02,230
It's one of the biggest genres of music 
in this country.

2094
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:04,450
Not only that,
I bet they sell more fucking albums than

2095
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:09,451
anybody.
His country going out there and making 

2096
01:24:09,451 --> 01:24:10,890
redacted and lions for lambs and 
rendition and Avatar and all these.

2097
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:13,840
These Suzanne Thai corporate screeds.
The point is,

2098
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:15,810
I know what you're talking about.
You his country.

2099
01:24:15,811 --> 01:24:17,620
He's not going to the movie.
Is that what you're saying?

2100
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,210
Yeah.
Fucking movie about aliens,

2101
01:24:19,211 --> 01:24:20,020
Bro.
Avatar.

2102
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:24,010
The movie is possibly the biggest piece 
of Neil environmentalist propaganda.

2103
01:24:24,011 --> 01:24:29,011
You talking about Pizza Gate,
you son of a bitch is a fucking amazing 

2104
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,600
guy.
Blue Aliens.

2105
01:24:31,601 --> 01:24:33,070
Now,
just out of boredom.

2106
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,870
That guy fell in love with that blue 
alien.

2107
01:24:34,871 --> 01:24:35,920
He became one of them,
Bro.

2108
01:24:35,921 --> 01:24:40,921
He was paralyzed.
They put them inside the blue alien 

2109
01:24:40,921 --> 01:24:42,991
mind.
James Cameron could buy an island in 

2110
01:24:42,991 --> 01:24:45,661
paint people blue and have them run 
around for the rest of his life if he 

2111
01:24:45,661 --> 01:24:48,151
wanted.
Instead he decides to print them out on 

2112
01:24:48,151 --> 01:24:48,940
blu rays using petroleum products.
It was a dope movie and you're a fucking

2113
01:24:48,941 --> 01:24:49,570
communist.

2114
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,630
Communist to fucking great movie.
You didn't enjoy it?

2115
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:55,390
No,
I hated it.

2116
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:57,670
I thought it was a terrible dude.
Is Great.

2117
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:02,350
Really fucking flying dragons.
Bad Ass marines.

2118
01:25:02,351 --> 01:25:04,840
What else do you want?
What kind of a pussy am I talking to?

2119
01:25:04,841 --> 01:25:07,090
What happened to you?
You've been up in Michigan too long.

2120
01:25:07,091 --> 01:25:09,310
It's too cold in the winter.
It's too cold in the winter.

2121
01:25:09,311 --> 01:25:11,660
Therefore I need to like Avatar for your
brain.

2122
01:25:11,661 --> 01:25:13,630
You don't think straight.
You just want to stay home.

2123
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:19,170
You like it.
How do you actually like avatars that 

2124
01:25:19,170 --> 01:25:19,210
can't wait for Avatar to really hurt?
It's underwater.

2125
01:25:19,211 --> 01:25:22,990
That even better.
They just stole that idea from Mario.

2126
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:23,860
Level two.
Let's make it.

2127
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:29,150
Cameron is a bad motherfucker.
He's one of the best directors of all 

2128
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:29,530
time.
He's a classic.

2129
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:31,990
He's a great director.
He's also political moron.

2130
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,640
I don't care about his politics.

2131
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:34,460
He makes great.
No.

2132
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:39,680
The point I was making,
I was talking about the media and 

2133
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,260
entertainment industry.
The backlash for someone who.

2134
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:42,790
I'm not even a huge supporter of Donald 
trump.

2135
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:47,791
Neither one of us are,
so I think we can be relatively 

2136
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:47,791
objective,
so let's remove country,

2137
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:49,160
but if you look at the end,
have you turned on CNN or something?

2138
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,980
Drink slow down.
Have you turned it on?

2139
01:25:50,981 --> 01:25:51,650
CNN,
reese.

2140
01:25:51,651 --> 01:25:52,630
Cheers.
Cheers.

2141
01:25:53,530 --> 01:25:54,550
Cheers.
Well,

2142
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:57,100
a good drink.
It good to the.

2143
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,370
This is literally like one guy in high 
school.

2144
01:26:00,371 --> 01:26:02,760
Relax.
If you want me to drink it.

2145
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:04,370
That was a dope movie.
It was horrible.

2146
01:26:04,371 --> 01:26:05,810
The guy in high school,
if you love me,

2147
01:26:05,811 --> 01:26:08,170
you'll drink it.
Who the fuck were you partying with guys

2148
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:13,220
like you?
Apparently kid rock being considered as 

2149
01:26:14,451 --> 01:26:16,490
potential sentence.
Could you see that today?

2150
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,350
Hold the fuck on.
Is that true?

2151
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:22,160
Is a bowhunter I'm voting for him.
Actually just saw his interview with Dan

2152
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,240
Rather last night was pretty 
interesting.

2153
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:26,240
He's a lot smarter than I think you.
I'd give him credit for it.

2154
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,890
He's not a dumb guy.
He's not a dumb guy.

2155
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,630
Have you ever seen him alive?
No,

2156
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:31,100
I have not,
but I like what he does.

2157
01:26:31,101 --> 01:26:32,750
You know what he does?
He puts a lot of effort.

2158
01:26:32,751 --> 01:26:37,751
Extremely low ticket prices,
like 20 bucks for a guy like him that's 

2159
01:26:37,751 --> 01:26:41,411
huge.
Sales out these places and he gets a 

2160
01:26:41,411 --> 01:26:41,411
piece of the booze.
He's smart.

2161
01:26:41,411 --> 01:26:45,800
He's a smart guy.
Given he's given his audience like a 

2162
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:45,800
good deal.
Yeah.

2163
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:46,730
It makes a good deal with the venues 
like,

2164
01:26:46,731 --> 01:26:51,731
look,
if kid rock showing up this fucking 

2165
01:26:51,731 --> 01:26:51,731
place of selling out,
so let's just make a deal.

2166
01:26:51,731 --> 01:26:53,840
Let's make a deal in his deal is is 
really smart.

2167
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:54,800
I like what he's doing.

2168
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:56,450
Well,
that's a good example of a guy not being

2169
01:26:56,451 --> 01:26:57,770
forced to do it.
Right.

2170
01:26:57,771 --> 01:26:59,930
He's just doing it because he wants to 
do something that helps people.

2171
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:02,230
Plus you've got a dope Cadillac.
You ever seen his Cadillac?

2172
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:07,640
He had one of them.
West coast customs custom made Cadillac 

2173
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:11,320
as the shit man.
Where he got damn impressive is that 

2174
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,280
they remember that.
So if you got to touch it.

2175
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:18,440
He started a beer company.
It was called like bad ass American bad 

2176
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:18,440
ass or something.
Beer.

2177
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,040
I like kid rock there.
I said it.

2178
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:21,000
Do you like his music?
He just like wants to do.

2179
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:23,090
No,
I like some of his music is not bad.

2180
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:28,360
I agree with you.
Some of his music is really not bad and 

2181
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:28,360
it's become popular to crap on them.
I liked them for that.

2182
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,650
Cadillac is unabashedly friends with Ted
nugent.

2183
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,240
Now you're still really into cars.

2184
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:37,660
I love cars because I remember I was 
listen to your podcast when wants and 

2185
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:40,271
you said it's only to the point when you
make so much money that you no longer 

2186
01:27:40,271 --> 01:27:40,940
care about money and you use your car as
an example.

2187
01:27:40,941 --> 01:27:41,320
You said,
you know,

2188
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,370
for example,
like I cry,

2189
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:47,410
I got a dent or something in my car at 
one point would have lost my mind 

2190
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:48,320
because that car man so much and now 
it's just like,

2191
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:49,700
okay,
it's only a car.

2192
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:53,420
So that was a good point though that you
made that when you have enough money,

2193
01:27:53,421 --> 01:27:55,460
it's kind like it's what I call gorilla 
Buddhism.

2194
01:27:55,750 --> 01:28:00,750
Okay.
Like the idea of this is part of 

2195
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:01,400
Buddhism that you should not be attached
to items.

2196
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:04,460
You should not be attached to objects 
and you,

2197
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:09,520
you know,
I have a friend of mine who became a 

2198
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:09,520
Buddhist monk and he wouldn't even have 
sex anymore.

2199
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,820
I gave up on sex all carnal pleasure.
All pleasure.

2200
01:28:10,821 --> 01:28:15,821
All attachment to women,
attachment to relationships and the 

2201
01:28:15,821 --> 01:28:18,701
ideas that you don't want to be 
connected to that because you are 

2202
01:28:18,701 --> 01:28:21,620
connected to owns you.
And my take on that was okay,

2203
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:23,880
but does it have to own you?
Like,

2204
01:28:24,030 --> 01:28:27,590
can you just enjoy automobiles?
Can't you enjoy engineering?

2205
01:28:27,830 --> 01:28:29,930
He said that you can't have a,
you know,

2206
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,300
you can't own a thing.
Can possess a thing.

2207
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:37,630
I feel like that is so ignorant of the 
world that we live and it's so 

2208
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:41,561
ridiculous.
You pretend you're choosing to act in a 

2209
01:28:41,561 --> 01:28:44,741
way that you're ignoring this amazing 
technological revolution that is going 

2210
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:51,101
on right before your eyes and it is 
going to fucking happen with you ride a 

2211
01:28:51,101 --> 01:28:53,650
bike to work or not.
It's gonna happen.

2212
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:58,660
It's what people do.
We are a part of this cascade of 

2213
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:03,311
electronic progress,
of innovation and is never going to stop

2214
01:29:03,631 --> 01:29:03,960
and that's.

2215
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:09,040
And that's tillie killer,
so I want to go back to that point in 

2216
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:09,040
the car,
but you know,

2217
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,691
that would be a good analogy out of 
business because of iphone or we put 

2218
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,620
political arm that I want to talk cars.
You're about that.

2219
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:18,750
There's nothing wrong with appreciating 
things that people make,

2220
01:29:18,751 --> 01:29:21,180
whether it's an automobile,
whether it's a painting,

2221
01:29:21,181 --> 01:29:25,290
a sculpture.
I feel like cars are like.

2222
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:30,790
People look at them as just 
transportation and I totally appreciate 

2223
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:30,900
that because they have worked so far.
If you get a prius,

2224
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:32,990
it's just transportation.
I said they're works of art,

2225
01:29:32,991 --> 01:29:37,991
so if you get in 1969 Mustang,
that is a goddamn marvel of time.

2226
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:44,120
It is a moment where people decided to 
just create something that just looks 

2227
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:48,660
inherently like,
like collectively bad ass.

2228
01:29:48,661 --> 01:29:51,160
There's no.
No one looks at a 69 mach one.

2229
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:52,530
He goes,
that's fucking gross.

2230
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:57,330
If you do fuck you with that is if you 
do fuck you right.

2231
01:29:57,331 --> 01:29:59,310
If you look at a 69 Mustang,
you don't.

2232
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:00,210
You don't say,
wow,

2233
01:30:00,211 --> 01:30:01,100
that's crazy.
Look,

2234
01:30:01,101 --> 01:30:06,101
and that's amazing.
Isn't that a big irony that you're able 

2235
01:30:06,101 --> 01:30:08,571
to appreciate it and not be attached to 
it because you've been more financially 

2236
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:08,571
successful?
Well,

2237
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:09,360
that's what I say.
You know,

2238
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,370
that's the whole point of this whole 
thing.

2239
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:15,780
It's not a rational,
normal position take because most people

2240
01:30:15,781 --> 01:30:18,510
are behind the eight ball all the time 
and it always need to pay their bills.

2241
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:19,920
Look at that car.
Look behind you,

2242
01:30:19,921 --> 01:30:21,410
sir.
Look at that.

2243
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:26,810
Yeah,
the low cuts it in and now we talked 

2244
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:26,810
about that earlier before you were 
drunk.

2245
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:29,430
It looks nice.
That's a fucking amazing car man.

2246
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:33,540
That 1969 Mustang is a marvel.
It all came together.

2247
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:35,280
It's just they figured it out.

2248
01:30:35,790 --> 01:30:40,790
They just figured out some way to make 
something that just is incredibly 

2249
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:43,800
pleasing to your eyes and doubles as 
transportation.

2250
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:45,000
No.
Should get one right?

2251
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:50,990
You can.
There's a company that takes them and 

2252
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:50,990
this is what I like.
They take the,

2253
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:55,100
the inside of it and the engine,
all that stuff out and they put a 2000,

2254
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:58,050
12 shelby gt,
500 inside of it.

2255
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:02,160
So you get like antilock brakes,
you get airbags,

2256
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:03,260
you get everything.
Yeah.

2257
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,120
And then they,
you know,

2258
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,970
they put it together and so that's the 
way to go.

2259
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:06,990
It's,
it's,

2260
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,880
this was actually my experience with 
very nice cars.

2261
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,090
I want to buy a car and I had very 
little money.

2262
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:17,450
So I went and I looked,
there was a 2003 Ford Taurus with like 

2263
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:18,360
60,000
miles on it and old guy had cataracts.

2264
01:31:18,361 --> 01:31:20,700
So they took away his license.
I can drive and like no,

2265
01:31:20,701 --> 01:31:21,510
they took away his license.

2266
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:24,630
So I went in to buy this tourist.
The guy took like four grand for it.

2267
01:31:24,890 --> 01:31:29,890
Not a great car,
it's getting you from point a to point 

2268
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:29,890
b,
but I had to walk through cars.

2269
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:33,090
One from George W dot Bush won.
I can't remember the singer,

2270
01:31:33,091 --> 01:31:37,190
and there was one that was the exact 
same model of car that James Dean.

2271
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:39,840
He died and apparently they're only like
13 porsche spyder.

2272
01:31:39,841 --> 01:31:40,730
You had a poor spot.
I don't know.

2273
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:41,910
I didn't have it.
I walked through it.

2274
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:43,980
Here's the crazy thing was this guy.
Well let me,

2275
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:47,190
let me finish with this guy who was 
selling this whole 2003 tourists.

2276
01:31:47,191 --> 01:31:48,840
What are you a ghost?
This is what he drove,

2277
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,030
right?
But you know what his business was?

2278
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:56,330
His business was customizing cars like 
that poor spider and doing high end 

2279
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:57,900
cars.
People like George W dot Bush,

2280
01:31:58,110 --> 01:32:03,110
the nicest cars in the country and he 
drove it 2003 Ford Taurus that I bought 

2281
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:03,110
from him.

2282
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:08,130
It was the most.
It was just this surreal experience 

2283
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:08,130
walking through these cars that.
I mean you don't even want to touch,

2284
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:09,100
right?
You want to put a fingerprint on it.

2285
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:11,930
And this guy I found out later was a 
multimillionaire.

2286
01:32:11,931 --> 01:32:15,460
He could afford any car that he wanted.
He had 2003 tourists.

2287
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,170
Well,
some people do that because they want to

2288
01:32:17,171 --> 01:32:19,770
stay low key and they just want to just 
kind of chill man.

2289
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:20,440
You know,
there's,

2290
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:22,030
there's that,
there's definitely that.

2291
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:27,270
Like Henry rollins drives a Mazda six.
He drives like a regular car and the 

2292
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:29,140
reason why he does it is because he's 
just like,

2293
01:32:29,141 --> 01:32:30,190
he's not,
he doesn't give a fuck.

2294
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:33,610
Henry wants to like sit in front of his 
gigantic $200,000

2295
01:32:33,611 --> 01:32:36,910
speakers and listen to records.
Like he doesn't care about his car.

2296
01:32:36,911 --> 01:32:39,640
So like for him it's like he doesn't 
want a ball,

2297
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:40,690
he doesn't want to floss.

2298
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:43,600
He wears the same t shirt.
He has like 100 gray tee shirts.

2299
01:32:43,601 --> 01:32:45,040
He wears the same thing every day.
He said,

2300
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:50,400
well,
he's a fascinating character in that 

2301
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:50,400
regard because he's a guy who has 
financial means.

2302
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,811
Like he has a very wealthy guy,
but he chooses not spending on things 

2303
01:32:54,811 --> 01:32:54,811
like that.
Yeah.

2304
01:32:54,811 --> 01:32:56,770
Well it's like my dad gave me this 
analogy one time.

2305
01:32:56,771 --> 01:32:58,720
We're talking about cars or the ability 
to appreciate it,

2306
01:32:58,721 --> 01:33:00,280
but you don't need it.
It's like air,

2307
01:33:00,281 --> 01:33:05,281
right?
If you all of a sudden you stopped 

2308
01:33:05,281 --> 01:33:05,281
breathing,
you don't have air.

2309
01:33:05,281 --> 01:33:05,281
All you can think about is breathing,
right?

2310
01:33:05,281 --> 01:33:09,700
That's the first thing that do just.
I can do Jitsu for being suffocated by 

2311
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:09,700
300 pound guy inside control.
Um,

2312
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,440
what's the same thing with money?
If you take away the money,

2313
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:14,230
all you can think about is money because
you need money.

2314
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,540
And my point was like we were talking 
about earlier,

2315
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:21,541
is we don't want people in those 
positions determining exactly what I 

2316
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:22,990
have to do with my money personally.

2317
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:28,470
As soon as you get money,
you get this stress alleviation that's 

2318
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:29,440
palpable.
I mean,

2319
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:34,441
I'm sure it's happened to you because 
you've been really successful over the 

2320
01:33:34,441 --> 01:33:37,380
last few years when you all of a sudden 
don't worry about whether or not you 

2321
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:37,750
could pay a gas bill this month.
Right?

2322
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:41,020
It's a different feeling.
But until I was 25 years old,

2323
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:46,260
every day of my life was checked.
Check everyday am I was barely mean 

2324
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:47,080
fucking barely,
you know,

2325
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:48,670
lying to the landlord.
I sent it.

2326
01:33:48,671 --> 01:33:50,010
What happened?
You know,

2327
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:53,890
I mean everybody's,
everybody's who's been in that situation

2328
01:33:53,891 --> 01:33:57,730
where you're like literally wondering 
how much can I spend today to eat,

2329
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:58,930
you know,
and I've been,

2330
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:03,990
I've been there and we all been there 
the moment I got a development deal way 

2331
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:04,660
back in the day with Disney of all 
people,

2332
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:08,170
of all peoples on the Disney show.
Like either you're just there,

2333
01:34:08,171 --> 01:34:09,760
like he's a young good looking guy.

2334
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:13,180
Let's put them into little stud muffin 
when I was young and they saw your set.

2335
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:13,870
And I'm like,
Oh,

2336
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:16,180
I was boy,
pretty you wanting to be on TV.

2337
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:17,370
Uh,
well it was,

2338
01:34:17,371 --> 01:34:20,260
you know,
1993 or something like that.

2339
01:34:20,261 --> 01:34:23,890
So I got a development deal because it 
did an mtv half hour comedy hour.

2340
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:28,900
I remember those shows do.
I did one episode of the MTV half hour 

2341
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:30,430
comedy hour and I got a development deal
from Disney because of it.

2342
01:34:30,431 --> 01:34:34,400
I got like this little thing and they 
sent me some money and uh,

2343
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:39,600
as soon as they sent me some money it 
was like literally like someone just 

2344
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,130
took a weight,
lifted it,

2345
01:34:40,131 --> 01:34:45,131
like I was carrying around a weighted 
backpack right my whole life and they 

2346
01:34:45,131 --> 01:34:47,410
took it off and it wasn't enough money 
where I was wealthy,

2347
01:34:47,411 --> 01:34:48,970
where I could say I don't have to work 
again,

2348
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:51,880
but it was enough money where I didn't 
have to think about money for a year.

2349
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:53,710
Right.
And so all of a sudden I was like,

2350
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:58,740
wow,
this is what it feels like to not worry 

2351
01:34:58,740 --> 01:34:59,030
about bills.
I have never felt this before.

2352
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:02,990
And then I became obsessed with 
maintaining that position.

2353
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:04,730
Once you realize that,
I was like,

2354
01:35:04,731 --> 01:35:06,250
oh my God,
I'm a bulldog.

2355
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:08,110
I'm going to work constantly.
I'm going to,

2356
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:09,610
I'm going to do stand up.
I'm now.

2357
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:11,710
I'm not quitting anything will.
Now.

2358
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:16,870
Why was that?
Because I realized how important it is 

2359
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:19,670
to not be dependent on anyone,
to not to not change.

2360
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:24,820
Like here's the thing about looking at.
You're talking about Hollywood and the 

2361
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:26,210
way people would behave in Hollywood.
It's in many ways,

2362
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:31,540
it's a self in forcing ideology in that 
you know that someone like Meryl Streep 

2363
01:35:34,011 --> 01:35:39,011
who gets up in front of the Golden 
Globes or whatever the fuck it was and 

2364
01:35:39,011 --> 01:35:39,930
says crazy shit,
real art,

2365
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:44,300
but when she's saying that what she's 
doing is she's like,

2366
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:47,470
it's a war cry for,
for the likeminded.

2367
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:47,960
Yeah.
You know,

2368
01:35:47,961 --> 01:35:51,090
there's no reason to say that and for 
any other reason she's,

2369
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:56,130
she wants to rally the troops.
She wants to enforce her ideas and she 

2370
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:58,940
wants to make sure that everyone is on 
board and the reason she said something,

2371
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:03,960
she hollywood royalty because and 
because of that she would say something 

2372
01:36:04,311 --> 01:36:09,311
that stupid that was received the way it
was because she probably ran it by a 

2373
01:36:09,311 --> 01:36:09,650
bunch of people beforehand.
Not,

2374
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,720
not that the point is not a single 
person there.

2375
01:36:11,721 --> 01:36:13,850
They all roared and cheered them on a 
single person.

2376
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:15,260
There it goes.
What?

2377
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,690
Of course you're surrounded by people,
but.

2378
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:21,920
But what I'm saying is that those people
that are reacting to that,

2379
01:36:21,921 --> 01:36:25,520
they may agree with it or they may feel 
like they have to agree with it.

2380
01:36:25,521 --> 01:36:30,521
Yeah.
I don't ever want to be the guy who 

2381
01:36:30,521 --> 01:36:30,521
feels like he has to agree with 
something.

2382
01:36:30,521 --> 01:36:33,530
I grew up in a weird way where like my 
parents got.

2383
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:38,680
They broke up when I was really young 
and we moved around a lot and I didn't 

2384
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:42,110
have roots like I didn't live in one 
place until Massachusetts when I was 13.

2385
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:47,410
I lived there for a long time.
That was the first place I lived for a 

2386
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:50,141
long time and I got a chance to see the 
way people cling to ideas versus 

2387
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:58,270
actually believe things and I think it's
very important to find out what you 

2388
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:00,680
actually believe and it's almost 
impossible in Hollywood.

2389
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:05,730
Yeah,
because in Hollywood people have to 

2390
01:37:05,730 --> 01:37:05,730
audition for things.
Right,

2391
01:37:05,730 --> 01:37:05,730
and I've been there,
man,

2392
01:37:05,730 --> 01:37:10,121
it's gross.
You go in this room and some person 

2393
01:37:10,121 --> 01:37:12,881
looks at you and they have a clipboard 
and they're judging you and they have 

2394
01:37:12,881 --> 01:37:16,030
power and the same with and unions can 
control groups of people.

2395
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:22,090
The same thing can happen for really 
self-righteous ideologues who happen to 

2396
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:26,831
be holding that clipboard.
Well then there's also the throwing out 

2397
01:37:26,831 --> 01:37:29,531
the baby with the bathwater.
We're calling anybody who has a 

2398
01:37:29,531 --> 01:37:31,511
worldview and idealog and I do think 
that you're susceptible if you don't 

2399
01:37:31,511 --> 01:37:33,140
have a framework from which you look 
through the world.

2400
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:34,490
If you have a prison where you go,
okay,

2401
01:37:34,491 --> 01:37:36,490
hold on a second.
If you're a hardcore Democrat,

2402
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,870
do or die without any exceptions 
whatsoever.

2403
01:37:38,871 --> 01:37:40,490
You're an ideologue.
If you start going,

2404
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:45,700
US versus them.
I kind of had conversations with people 

2405
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:46,550
in Hollywood where they've talked to me 
about the Democratic Party.

2406
01:37:46,551 --> 01:37:48,740
They'll go,
we have to win the house when the house.

2407
01:37:48,741 --> 01:37:49,390
Then we get this like,
well,

2408
01:37:49,391 --> 01:37:50,700
what is this we man,
yeah,

2409
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:53,240
you make a fucking cartoon,
but then you have people who just go,

2410
01:37:53,241 --> 01:37:54,340
man,
it's left and right.

2411
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:55,440
It's all same.

2412
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:56,220
No,
it's not.

2413
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,800
You do need to determine a prism through
which you see the world.

2414
01:37:58,801 --> 01:38:01,560
For example,
there's a very clear decision you make.

2415
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:06,590
Do I believe in choice?
Do I believe in freedom and personal 

2416
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:09,441
liberty or do I believe in equal 
outcomes and that doesn't mean that you 

2417
01:38:09,441 --> 01:38:10,050
line up with either party the same on 
every single issue,

2418
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,870
but it is a filter through which you 
will be able to see it.

2419
01:38:13,871 --> 01:38:15,270
She explained those options.
Again,

2420
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:20,980
a good example right now you have to 
make it so someone has to make a 

2421
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:22,170
decision right now to one of the three 
options that you said.

2422
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:24,270
No,
I put two options and what do I value?

2423
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:26,850
Virginal liberty,
personal liberty and choice,

2424
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:27,630
right?
And choice.

2425
01:38:27,631 --> 01:38:32,631
Freedom of choice,
or do I value the idea of equal 

2426
01:38:32,631 --> 01:38:32,631
outcomes?
Oh,

2427
01:38:32,631 --> 01:38:36,591
well,
equal outcomes is ridiculous because I 

2428
01:38:36,591 --> 01:38:37,140
can't play basketball,
but you can't understand that unless you

2429
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:38,640
have some kind of of people don't like 
to.

2430
01:38:38,690 --> 01:38:40,140
There's an ism there,
don't you think?

2431
01:38:40,141 --> 01:38:44,070
The law that is in things,
people need to play dodge ball.

2432
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:49,080
The need to bring back dodge ball.
You gotta realize stay away from that 

2433
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:49,650
big fucker.
That guy throws that dodge ball.

2434
01:38:49,651 --> 01:38:51,750
It's going to hurt when the little kid 
gets hit,

2435
01:38:51,751 --> 01:38:56,751
rush them through the Asian kid with the
glasses that's reading them as soon as 

2436
01:38:57,811 --> 01:38:59,580
the lesson.
But that kid's a bad motherfucker.

2437
01:38:59,581 --> 01:39:01,830
Maybe he's from Thailand.
Maybe people didn't fuck with them since

2438
01:39:01,831 --> 01:39:02,880
it was little.
Pretty rare.

2439
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:04,680
Catch them outside of kick you in the 
Dick.

2440
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:06,720
How about that guy?
That's possible.

2441
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,350
That's entirely possible.
But the point is there,

2442
01:39:08,351 --> 01:39:10,590
there is an ism and people don't need to
shy away from saying,

2443
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:11,930
you know what,
I do have some.

2444
01:39:12,330 --> 01:39:13,960
There is an ism.
What do you mean by an ism?

2445
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:18,160
Ism where people,
whether we're conservatism left ism,

2446
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:20,730
uh,
liberalism.

2447
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:24,520
I don't think anybody's ever said to act
as though well,

2448
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:27,030
because liberalism is the first person 
to say leftism.

2449
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:28,520
No,
I don't think so at all.

2450
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:33,650
Been alive for 49 years.
Never heard a single motherfucker say 

2451
01:39:33,650 --> 01:39:34,110
left is well because today's left is not
the same as classical liberals.

2452
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:39,140
The word leftism don't skirt the issue.
That might be the first time anybody's 

2453
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:40,590
ever said,
have you ever heard of leftism?

2454
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:46,260
Fuck,
I'll stick with it.

2455
01:39:46,261 --> 01:39:51,261
I don't care.
I don't think liberalism describes the 

2456
01:39:51,261 --> 01:39:51,261
current,
the current progressive movement,

2457
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:52,920
um,
but people want people to say,

2458
01:39:52,921 --> 01:39:53,140
well,
I,

2459
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,830
I'm not a navy log.
Well actually a lot of people,

2460
01:39:55,870 --> 01:40:00,870
they don't realize they are to some 
degree and you just had to determine to 

2461
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:01,410
which degree that is and recognize that 
about yourself.

2462
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,270
Everyone has a leaning.
Well,

2463
01:40:03,271 --> 01:40:04,830
everyone has.
It makes it easier.

2464
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:10,050
It makes it easier to get along if you 
subscribe to a predetermined set.

2465
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:11,700
I'm not talking about this and I'm not 
talking about that.

2466
01:40:11,701 --> 01:40:13,800
There's no predetermined set of values 
or ideas.

2467
01:40:13,801 --> 01:40:14,610
If someone says,
okay,

2468
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:16,530
I'm looking at the world through this 
Lens,

2469
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:21,560
do I look through it where we need to 
ensure fairness and equal outcomes?

2470
01:40:21,661 --> 01:40:26,661
Or do I look through it?
And the idea that people should be free 

2471
01:40:26,661 --> 01:40:28,671
to make their own decisions.
That doesn't mean you're subscribing to 

2472
01:40:28,671 --> 01:40:28,671
the Republican Party when you're talking
about your first initial.

2473
01:40:28,671 --> 01:40:32,630
See what I'm talking about,
what we were talking about really 

2474
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:32,630
recently,
but I agree with you.

2475
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:32,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

2476
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:35,610
I mean,
I think what we should do see,

2477
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:42,560
I think a big part of the problem with 
human beings today is that the,

2478
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:48,890
it's not a fair hand of cards that were 
dealt and some want to pretend that it 

2479
01:40:48,991 --> 01:40:50,220
is.
It's not,

2480
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:53,350
it's just not and you know it and I know
it and we say,

2481
01:40:53,351 --> 01:40:53,830
well,
you know what,

2482
01:40:53,831 --> 01:40:55,510
you've got to do the best with what 
you've got.

2483
01:40:55,511 --> 01:40:56,680
And I agree with that.
Yeah.

2484
01:40:57,010 --> 01:41:02,010
The real problem with that as the people
that got to fucking ones those people 

2485
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:03,790
more than a prone.
Well,

2486
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:08,791
because for them,
the guy with four aces just got Donald 

2487
01:41:08,791 --> 01:41:08,880
Trump jr.

2488
01:41:11,010 --> 01:41:14,380
He was lucky motherfucker by the way.
Donald trump jr is a very nice guy.

2489
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:16,720
He's a sportsman and a hunter and now 
that he's.

2490
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:17,830
No,
I like him.

2491
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:20,320
He's my friend.
I mean hunting advocate.

2492
01:41:20,321 --> 01:41:21,820
He is.
I mean I only text him,

2493
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:24,550
but he's good buddies with and now 
you're going to.

2494
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:27,100
The forms are going to go nuts.
Joe rogan illuminati.

2495
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:29,020
Donald trump said it before.
I've said it before.

2496
01:41:29,390 --> 01:41:34,390
They're very friendly guy.
I've every single person that I know 

2497
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:35,260
that it's come in contact with Donald 
Trump.

2498
01:41:35,261 --> 01:41:38,860
Jr said he's a lovely man.
Nothing but good things about him.

2499
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:40,780
One hundred percent.
He became more wealthy.

2500
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:45,810
When you become more successful,
do you find yourself being more 

2501
01:41:45,810 --> 01:41:45,810
generous?
I've always been a generous person,

2502
01:41:45,810 --> 01:41:50,610
but whenever I could be,
because I realized the importance of 

2503
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:54,631
comradery.
I realized that because I didn't have a 

2504
01:41:54,631 --> 01:41:54,631
lot of friends because it was constantly
moving around,

2505
01:41:54,631 --> 01:41:56,510
so when I had friends,
I've valued them greatly there.

2506
01:41:56,530 --> 01:41:59,110
They were not disposable.
Like my friends to me,

2507
01:41:59,130 --> 01:42:01,970
like they are as important as my family 
is.

2508
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:03,970
A bunch of my friends have lived with 
me,

2509
01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:05,440
you know,
like when they'd been broke.

2510
01:42:05,441 --> 01:42:08,530
I like when I was single,
especially like tate live with me,

2511
01:42:08,531 --> 01:42:10,210
duck and live with me.
They were like,

2512
01:42:10,211 --> 01:42:11,110
I got nowhere to go.
I'm like,

2513
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:12,820
fuck you Dude.
Come on man.

2514
01:42:12,821 --> 01:42:15,460
So money just amplify your character.
didn'T change it.

2515
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:16,780
Well,
it,

2516
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:22,140
it helped me help people right when I 
had the opportunity to do something.

2517
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,920
Like if you see someone and they were a 
good friend and your,

2518
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:28,220
your.
You have a bounty of wealth,

2519
01:42:28,221 --> 01:42:31,450
like could say a good friend is hungry,
you have all this food.

2520
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:34,330
You would have to be some kind of piece 
of shit to say,

2521
01:42:34,331 --> 01:42:37,810
don't eat my food that I can never 
possibly all eat myself.

2522
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:42,840
Right?
You would want them to eat so you feel 

2523
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:42,840
better,
but my point is that's who you are.

2524
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:47,310
Right,
and I will say gi Joe has been generous 

2525
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:49,140
with what you've been generous with me 
in the sense of actually allowing me on 

2526
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:50,950
the show content,
whether people get mad about it or not,

2527
01:42:50,951 --> 01:42:55,951
and I appreciate that,
but the point is the money didn't 

2528
01:42:55,951 --> 01:42:55,951
change.
You would amplify.

2529
01:42:55,951 --> 01:42:55,951
It's like alcohol.
It amplifies your character.

2530
01:42:55,951 --> 01:42:56,830
You're not a racist and you.
Well,

2531
01:42:56,831 --> 01:42:59,320
I'm not an alcoholic,
so it amplifies my character.

2532
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,210
Amplified your character.
Right?

2533
01:43:01,450 --> 01:43:03,220
And so that's important people to know 
because you have.

2534
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:08,250
If you,
if you take that and you believe that 

2535
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:10,291
again,
as a worldview that money doesn't 

2536
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:10,291
necessarily.
It can.

2537
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:10,750
It doesn't inherently change who you 
are.

2538
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:16,140
you'll find that you'll see just as many
greedy poor people as you will wealthy 

2539
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:19,441
people,
and that's important because when we're 

2540
01:43:19,441 --> 01:43:20,380
deciding on some arbitrary number and we
just tossed it to democracy,

2541
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:25,560
you can have just as many greedy 
portions of the masses as you would big 

2542
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:28,500
bankers and they can just vote in their 
own self interest and that's not right 

2543
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:28,500
either.

2544
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:29,290
WHat do you mean by an arbitrary number?
Liquid?

2545
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:31,240
Well,
I'm saying what should a ceo make?

2546
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:32,830
Right?
What's the fair minimum wage,

2547
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:35,530
and if you understand that there can be 
people making less than minimum wage.

2548
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:38,170
Who if they got the joe rogan,
they made their break,

2549
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:43,200
you worked really hard,
but all of a sudden they have millions 

2550
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,330
of dollars.
They're just as greedy as they are 

2551
01:43:45,330 --> 01:43:45,330
making $13 an hour.
Again,

2552
01:43:45,330 --> 01:43:45,520
it's no at the human condition question 
leah,

2553
01:43:45,521 --> 01:43:50,521
correct.
That there are people that don't care 

2554
01:43:50,521 --> 01:43:50,521
about other people's feelings,
don't matter what they make,

2555
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,460
but I say to you,
do you have kids?

2556
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:53,450
not yet.
No.

2557
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:58,870
I would say to you as a parent that a 
big part of that was how they were 

2558
01:43:58,870 --> 01:44:01,130
treated while they were developing 
trend.

2559
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:04,760
There's genetic variables,
there's people that have illnesses,

2560
01:44:04,761 --> 01:44:06,140
mental illnesses.
There's is,

2561
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:11,170
there's all sorts of.
There's all sorts of variables wheN it 

2562
01:44:11,170 --> 01:44:12,220
comes to who is steven crowder at 29 
years of age now?

2563
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,910
Who are you?
How'd you get to this point?

2564
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:17,210
Or who am I at 49 years of age?
How did I get to this point?

2565
01:44:17,211 --> 01:44:18,200
40 nine,
40 nIne.

2566
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:20,520
Moisturize.
Right.

2567
01:44:22,190 --> 01:44:24,050
I was watching the day where you lifted 
a kettlebell.

2568
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,460
he said,
I'm a strong motherfucker,

2569
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:28,280
although I probably didn't say that.
You did say tHat.

2570
01:44:28,281 --> 01:44:29,210
You said those exact words.

2571
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:33,740
Oh yeah,
that's right.

2572
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:38,330
He was talking to me about like really 
talking about 450 pounds,

2573
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:39,380
like dead lifts.
I'm like,

2574
01:44:39,381 --> 01:44:44,381
dude,
that's not that much yet because you 

2575
01:44:44,381 --> 01:44:44,381
think you do.
Yeah,

2576
01:44:44,381 --> 01:44:44,381
yeah,
yeah.

2577
01:44:44,381 --> 01:44:44,381
I,
um,

2578
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:46,220
I had knee surgery recently and so for 
me,

2579
01:44:46,221 --> 01:44:51,221
I know you went through the jujitsu 
drawbacks and then got back in and blew 

2580
01:44:51,221 --> 01:44:51,320
your acl out.
Well,

2581
01:44:51,321 --> 01:44:54,140
actually I tore my lcl and the acl was 
slightly torn,

2582
01:44:54,141 --> 01:44:59,141
but they were like,
actually the guy who does the surgery 

2583
01:44:59,141 --> 01:44:59,141
and the redwings,
he came out.

2584
01:44:59,141 --> 01:44:59,141
He goes,
do you wrestle?

2585
01:44:59,141 --> 01:44:59,540
I said,
yeah.

2586
01:44:59,541 --> 01:44:59,900
He goes,
okay.

2587
01:44:59,901 --> 01:45:03,500
We rarely ever see an lcl that torn 
without a blown acl.

2588
01:45:03,501 --> 01:45:04,670
He's like,
did you do anything with your ankle?

2589
01:45:04,671 --> 01:45:09,310
Was going towards your face guard pass?
But the problem is they went in and they

2590
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:14,320
fix that,
but that wasn't the real raw real 

2591
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:14,320
problem.

2592
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:14,320
THe real problem is my kneecap,
I guess whatever it is,

2593
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:18,941
the tissue that holds that in place,
it's gone and they said it would be 

2594
01:45:18,941 --> 01:45:20,060
easier if you had a torn acl to fix 
because we know what it is like with the

2595
01:45:20,061 --> 01:45:21,320
kneecap,
take it out,

2596
01:45:21,321 --> 01:45:23,570
do a replacement.
There's really a vacatIon.

2597
01:45:23,571 --> 01:45:25,030
Kneecap.
I mean they saId.

2598
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:30,250
He basically said there's no reason to 
do anything with a kneecap because we 

2599
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:30,250
don't know what to say.
If they replace it,

2600
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:34,960
replace it with an iron one.
Just start still rich franklin versus 

2601
01:45:37,371 --> 01:45:42,371
anderson silva just rearrange this face.
That was so heartbreaking to watch.

2602
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:47,720
A lot of dudes were steel cups to tie 
cups necessarily.

2603
01:45:47,721 --> 01:45:49,580
think there's a law against it in the 
ufc.

2604
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:53,120
They started making laws against it in 
brazilian jujitsu.

2605
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:54,950
Jujitsu.
Because you're talking to.

2606
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:56,660
I can't talk.
No,

2607
01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:57,500
no.
Here's the deal.

2608
01:45:57,970 --> 01:45:59,540
I had a buddy of mine did it to me once.

2609
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:02,840
My friend amir ren have already.
He got on top.

2610
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:04,130
No,
he got on top of me,

2611
01:46:04,131 --> 01:46:09,131
mounted me and he had a steel cup on and
he was essentially fucking my solar 

2612
01:46:09,131 --> 01:46:12,750
plexus.
It was totally uncomfortable because I'm

2613
01:46:12,751 --> 01:46:13,160
asking,
well,

2614
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:18,580
it's metal.
I mean you have a metal piece and it 

2615
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:21,520
really affects armbars in particular it.
It creates an unnatural fulcrum.

2616
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:24,110
Well,
a back take two is really uncomfortable.

2617
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:25,950
Exactly.
It's going into your lower spine.

2618
01:46:25,970 --> 01:46:28,670
Regular cup.
Like I use a diamond mma cup,

2619
01:46:28,671 --> 01:46:30,830
you know those aren't.
Those are their compression shorts.

2620
01:46:30,831 --> 01:46:31,550
Yeah,
they're,

2621
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:36,580
they're in compression shorts and the 
outside of them is like this rubberized 

2622
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:36,580
thing.
Yep.

2623
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:40,820
And the outside in the front is all like
a really hard plastic.

2624
01:46:40,821 --> 01:46:45,821
Like they.
There's videos of them showing people 

2625
01:46:45,821 --> 01:46:46,820
taking like full groin shots on purpose 
when that was or advertisements.

2626
01:46:46,821 --> 01:46:47,720
I can kick the ball.

2627
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:49,800
It really does protect you in an amazing
way,

2628
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:54,510
but it doesn't hurt like a,
like one of those steel tie cups.

2629
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:58,500
So these dudes are fucking real status.
They get these steel tie cup.

2630
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:00,610
It's definitely an advantage.
And you think,

2631
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:03,090
oh yeah.
well I think kenny,

2632
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:07,430
kenny florian fought with it.
I'm pretty sure if I'm a pretty closely.

2633
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:12,470
If you fucking mess up and you kicked 
kenny florian and she couldn't break 

2634
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:14,970
your foot kid that bar fight.
Hey,

2635
01:47:14,971 --> 01:47:16,850
why are you walking with a limp?
I kicked kenny florian.

2636
01:47:17,190 --> 01:47:19,900
I'm sure he doesn't wear it to the bar.
I'm talking about it in a cage.

2637
01:47:19,901 --> 01:47:21,240
You don't know.
That's a judgment.

2638
01:47:21,241 --> 01:47:23,130
I thinking.
Judge kenny.

2639
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:24,810
Yeah.
He wears tight pants.

2640
01:47:24,811 --> 01:47:26,370
There's no way.
There's no way.

2641
01:47:26,371 --> 01:47:29,670
He's got a fucking compress it.
The local dive.

2642
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,310
Just no one that he's looking to impress
a married man.

2643
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:37,310
You son of a bitch.
I thought you were conservative and 

2644
01:47:37,310 --> 01:47:37,690
Florida and dare you go there.
I'm going to take more tobacco.

2645
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:40,040
Packard.
Turn manson.

2646
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:42,630
I don't ask that tip to kiss ass and 
say,

2647
01:47:42,631 --> 01:47:43,710
look,
joe rogan so generous,

2648
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:47,010
but I do believe in again,
and go with the of isms.

2649
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:52,090
Generally.
This is a message to people that like 

2650
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:52,090
wonder whether they should be generous 
or not.

2651
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:55,920
Generosity makes you feel better.
It does.

2652
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:56,790
It Just does.
Like,

2653
01:47:56,820 --> 01:48:01,820
it's not a selfish thing to like this 
idea that um,

2654
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:06,600
oR not,
not necessarily not a selfish thing.

2655
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:09,570
This idea that to keep your money 
yourself,

2656
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,700
you protectIng yourself,
you're looking out for number one,

2657
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:13,530
it's not true,
right?

2658
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:16,500
It's,
it's the wrong way to think because when

2659
01:48:16,501 --> 01:48:21,501
you're generous,
especially when you're generous to 

2660
01:48:21,501 --> 01:48:23,781
friends,
it's super important that people who 

2661
01:48:23,781 --> 01:48:24,120
actually love that,
you expressed that to those people.

2662
01:48:24,330 --> 01:48:27,450
When you Do do that,
it's good for you too.

2663
01:48:27,570 --> 01:48:30,540
It just doesn't seem like it's good for 
you because people are so survival.

2664
01:48:30,541 --> 01:48:35,541
Oregon.
There's a great book called who really 

2665
01:48:35,541 --> 01:48:35,541
cares abouT famine mentality or brooks 
or David Brooks,

2666
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:40,850
but he went out kind of seeing who,
who actually donate and who's generous 

2667
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:41,700
and kind of going by political 
persuasion,

2668
01:48:41,701 --> 01:48:43,070
by geographical,
you know,

2669
01:48:43,071 --> 01:48:46,410
by just let me guess.
Conservatives are number one.

2670
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:47,940
Yes.
So,

2671
01:48:47,941 --> 01:48:48,700
um,
but,

2672
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:52,350
but especially litigious ones.
Yeah,

2673
01:48:52,650 --> 01:48:53,280
yeah,
yeah.

2674
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:57,120
That is actually true.
Fucking Michigan.

2675
01:48:57,750 --> 01:49:00,780
First off,
a minister I mentioned in my home state,

2676
01:49:00,781 --> 01:49:02,190
especially with jihadists out there,
you know,

2677
01:49:02,191 --> 01:49:04,620
you've seen the muslim videos.
Um,

2678
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:06,570
but uh,
there is the,

2679
01:49:06,571 --> 01:49:08,790
the ism and this is one thing that I do 
that I do sincerely believe,

2680
01:49:08,791 --> 01:49:10,440
and this is why I don't shy away from 
saying,

2681
01:49:10,441 --> 01:49:11,400
listen,
I'm a conservative.

2682
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:15,090
You saId some that was pretty telling 
you said because I really wanted to work

2683
01:49:15,091 --> 01:49:15,270
hard.

2684
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:16,800
I never wanted to be beholden to someone
again.

2685
01:49:16,801 --> 01:49:18,210
Right?
So you made that decision.

2686
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:23,780
Well,
you knew that if you did that and you 

2687
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:25,461
worked hard,
then you wouldn't be holding someone 

2688
01:49:25,461 --> 01:49:25,461
else.
That was,

2689
01:49:25,461 --> 01:49:25,461
that was the assumption you made.
Okay.

2690
01:49:25,461 --> 01:49:28,080
But there's a lot of.
Let me just go with this real quick.

2691
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:30,450
The assumption that that is free 
enterprise,

2692
01:49:30,451 --> 01:49:32,640
free enterprise or capitalism to use the
term,

2693
01:49:32,641 --> 01:49:35,590
right?
It can only work under the,

2694
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:39,300
under an optimistic society under people
believing they can retire and do better.

2695
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:44,540
socialism,
collectivism can only operate by 

2696
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:46,380
appealing to people's most selfish 
nature by appealing to people saying,

2697
01:49:46,381 --> 01:49:48,760
listen,
the cards or the deck is stacked against

2698
01:49:48,761 --> 01:49:49,930
you.
You can't do this.

2699
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:52,000
There's someone else out there.
It was an ace in the hole.

2700
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:54,430
You've been born without the leg up that
they have.

2701
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:55,930
Therefore,
I need to help you.

2702
01:49:55,930 --> 01:50:00,930
That is the big difference.
Capitalism can only survive and 

2703
01:50:00,930 --> 01:50:03,121
optimism.
Where's collectivism requires the worst 

2704
01:50:03,121 --> 01:50:04,270
of human nature to sustain itself.
Maybe I believe that,

2705
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:07,540
but what wouldn't it be nicer if people 
just.

2706
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:09,970
If someone figured out a way to say,
hey,

2707
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:15,780
how much do you really need?
Instead of saying you have to do this 

2708
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:17,320
and put on their deals,
it sounds like a nightmare.

2709
01:50:17,370 --> 01:50:18,640
No,
that's not what I'm saying.

2710
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:23,730
What I'm saying is can you contribute a 
small amount that's not even going to 

2711
01:50:25,291 --> 01:50:30,291
affect you,
but it's going to help other people and 

2712
01:50:30,291 --> 01:50:31,810
do you do that and if you do do that,
how do you do it?

2713
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:36,840
Do you do it in the form of generosity?
like do tip waitresses more than you 

2714
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:39,961
should do you do it in the form of 
giving out to charities that you feel 

2715
01:50:39,961 --> 01:50:44,101
are very worthy and you know you've 
researched them and you know the people 

2716
01:50:44,101 --> 01:50:44,101
that are behind them.

2717
01:50:44,101 --> 01:50:45,940
Do you do It in terms of,
you know,

2718
01:50:45,941 --> 01:50:50,941
a social work you do?
Do you do it in terms of putting out 

2719
01:50:50,941 --> 01:50:54,330
informational videos that help people 
figure out how they can advance their 

2720
01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:56,460
own lives?
We all do in certain one.

2721
01:50:56,500 --> 01:51:00,280
I know you do too.
Certain charitable things amongst people

2722
01:51:00,281 --> 01:51:05,281
we care about.
When you address causes that you care 

2723
01:51:05,281 --> 01:51:08,221
about,
you go out of your way in a non selfish 

2724
01:51:08,221 --> 01:51:10,591
way.
Try to eliminate certain things or or 

2725
01:51:10,591 --> 01:51:13,030
add to the coffers of certain 
organizations that are doing.

2726
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:14,680
Where do you think are good,
good things.

2727
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:19,710
I agree,
but that should be enforced more than 

2728
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:19,960
the idea that some people are fucking 
you.

2729
01:51:20,110 --> 01:51:20,800
Right?
Right.

2730
01:51:21,190 --> 01:51:21,570
Well,
I,

2731
01:51:21,571 --> 01:51:26,571
I agree with you and that's again that 
idea like you're talking about why are 

2732
01:51:26,571 --> 01:51:27,490
you giving to this cause why are you,
why are you donating your time?

2733
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:27,870
Right.
You're either,

2734
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:29,620
it comes down to either donating money 
or time.

2735
01:51:29,621 --> 01:51:32,590
Really the end of the day,
it's some sort of material goods or time

2736
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:35,260
because you're doing it with the belief 
that you'll help people.

2737
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:37,330
It doesn't work if you're being forced 
to because you know,

2738
01:51:37,331 --> 01:51:40,480
there's some people that do it for a tax
break now that's silly.

2739
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:43,850
No one gives away 100,000
dollars to get a kidney.

2740
01:51:43,851 --> 01:51:45,160
Got $40,000
tax break.

2741
01:51:45,161 --> 01:51:46,540
The math doesn't.
it might have to.

2742
01:51:46,541 --> 01:51:51,541
If you run some fucking llc,
you might have some weird shit llc.

2743
01:51:51,701 --> 01:51:56,701
Aren't you an llc?
Of course I'm talking about the other 

2744
01:51:56,701 --> 01:51:57,550
llc.
Some pipes.

2745
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,640
Let's smoke a pipe.
It smells amazing though,

2746
01:52:01,670 --> 01:52:02,750
doesn't it?
It's good.

2747
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:04,290
It really does smell good.
That's um,

2748
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:06,070
it's definitely way better than 
cigarettes.

2749
01:52:06,071 --> 01:52:09,010
WhIch shows you how much the fda has 
been fucking you.

2750
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:12,280
well actually they've now pipes or a 
controlled tobacco product,

2751
01:52:12,281 --> 01:52:17,281
which they didn't use to be,
but it's all the chemicals that are 

2752
01:52:17,281 --> 01:52:17,281
actually added two cigarettes.

2753
01:52:17,281 --> 01:52:17,950
What does that mean?
is it hard to get?

2754
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:20,110
I have to show my id to get piped into 
the underground.

2755
01:52:20,111 --> 01:52:20,840
There's,
there's,

2756
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:24,220
because with pipe tobaccos,
a lot of these local,

2757
01:52:24,221 --> 01:52:29,221
like a local tobacco shop,
they'll do their own blends so they'll 

2758
01:52:29,221 --> 01:52:32,191
buy pipe tobacco in bulk,
like that sear sucker from someplace in 

2759
01:52:32,191 --> 01:52:33,130
one of the carolinas and I think that's 
changing,

2760
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:36,010
so it actually removes the artistry 
where a lot of people like this is,

2761
01:52:36,011 --> 01:52:37,690
this is the blend I can get in.
I don't know.

2762
01:52:37,691 --> 01:52:38,380
You know,
holland,

2763
01:52:38,381 --> 01:52:39,640
Michigan,
you can't get anywhere else.

2764
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:41,830
It's amazing.
That's going away.

2765
01:52:41,831 --> 01:52:43,880
And what that does fda steps in is what 
are the,

2766
01:52:43,881 --> 01:52:48,881
do it favors the big boys who send out 
their tendons from one centralized 

2767
01:52:48,881 --> 01:52:49,370
company.
The smaller tobacconist can compete.

2768
01:52:49,371 --> 01:52:51,830
That's the worry about mariJuana.
Well,

2769
01:52:51,831 --> 01:52:52,210
right,
it'll,

2770
01:52:52,211 --> 01:52:57,211
it'll go legal.
You don't need these dispensary's 

2771
01:52:57,211 --> 01:52:57,211
anymore,
right?

2772
01:52:57,211 --> 01:52:57,211
Isn't that kind of what will happen?
They'll be out of business.

2773
01:52:57,211 --> 01:52:58,670
Exactly.
It's problem.

2774
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:00,530
Well,
what it also people,

2775
01:53:00,531 --> 01:53:05,531
it's okay to possess it and it's okay to
sell it or your friends can give you 

2776
01:53:05,531 --> 01:53:08,450
some on satisfying we'd ever got.
My yoga teacher gave it to me.

2777
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,400
That sounds about right.
How about that?

2778
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:16,180
Every time my wife goes in there tryna 
give her some kind of weird incense or 

2779
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:16,180
newest,
every time she goes,

2780
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:17,030
she goes into the pot store.
Yoga,

2781
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:19,280
yoga.
There's always something they're selling

2782
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,640
essential oils and pot.
No,

2783
01:53:21,650 --> 01:53:26,650
not pot,
but they're always got something you 

2784
01:53:26,650 --> 01:53:26,650
really want to put on incentives or 
something.

2785
01:53:26,650 --> 01:53:29,681
There's this my point.
My point is you're beholden to the yoga 

2786
01:53:29,681 --> 01:53:29,681
instructors,
so they use it sometimes.

2787
01:53:29,681 --> 01:53:33,380
The sales pitch,
my yoga instructor pure and she's my 

2788
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:33,380
friend.
What's,

2789
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:33,380
what's the posing with the pipe?
Fuck.

2790
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:38,340
You can't see when god said,
fuck you.

2791
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:44,291
It actually blew out his own lighter.
Fuck you right wing.

2792
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:46,200
Listen,
I mean,

2793
01:53:46,201 --> 01:53:50,450
I sit firmly in the flip flopping 
position of the middle.

2794
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:52,220
You don't though.
You're pretty,

2795
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:54,410
you're pretty fair.
Um,

2796
01:53:54,411 --> 01:53:56,020
and I do like to think that,
I mean,

2797
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:57,770
it's really hard to get leftists guests 
on our show.

2798
01:53:57,771 --> 01:54:00,290
That's just a reality.
We try and book them.

2799
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,330
And then after a couple of times,
well,

2800
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:03,830
you know,
it's the most leftist guests you've ever

2801
01:54:03,831 --> 01:54:04,100
had.

2802
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:08,150
Well,
we had [inaudible] chowdhry who actually

2803
01:54:08,151 --> 01:54:09,890
said I should die on hair.
Whoa.

2804
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:12,300
Yeah.
He's the guy who now he's in jail for,

2805
01:54:12,330 --> 01:54:14,510
for giving to isis or something from the
uk.

2806
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:16,600
SO we had to.
We had to create a whole new set.

2807
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:18,850
You should die on air.
Why?

2808
01:54:18,870 --> 01:54:20,560
Why do you say you should die?
Oh,

2809
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:23,670
because I did a three stooges routine.
dressing up as mahogany on the shabbas.

2810
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:24,500
Three old wife?
Yeah.

2811
01:54:24,501 --> 01:54:26,330
Isn't that amazing?
You should die for that.

2812
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:28,880
Die for dressing up as a guy.
Outside of that,

2813
01:54:28,881 --> 01:54:32,150
you know sally cone is pretty far left.
Christopher titus.

2814
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:35,630
Oh,
that's what I wanted to talk about.

2815
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:40,690
OH,
they want to talk about Michael Woods 

2816
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:40,690
junior because we tried to hit them on.
We wouldn't come on.

2817
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:43,970
The christopher titus debate was one of 
the most painful ones I've ever watched.

2818
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:45,710
Was it painful for you?

2819
01:54:45,790 --> 01:54:46,090
It,
it.

2820
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:51,180
It Was because I felt as though I 
usually do try and get into an 

2821
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:52,490
engagement of ideas and he was just 
screaming so much.

2822
01:54:52,910 --> 01:54:55,400
It was more painful for me because I'm a
dad.

2823
01:54:55,830 --> 01:54:59,220
yeah.
And dead kids something,

2824
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:04,420
know something went wrong somewhere 
along the line to get him to that place 

2825
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:06,170
where he's arguing about something.
We really doesn't know the facts.

2826
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:07,580
Yeah.
It wasn't,

2827
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:12,380
it wasn't just that.
It was when you were throwing out laws,

2828
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:16,220
regulations and he just didn't know 
enough.

2829
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:18,350
I kept arguing about it.
You know,

2830
01:55:18,351 --> 01:55:21,230
when someone's arguing about something 
and they don't know exactly what they're

2831
01:55:21,231 --> 01:55:21,970
talking about.
Yeah.

2832
01:55:22,010 --> 01:55:24,260
And they've gone down a dark road and 
instead saying,

2833
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:26,420
okay,
I can't really talk about this because I

2834
01:55:26,421 --> 01:55:28,850
don't,
I don't have any facts at my disposal.

2835
01:55:28,970 --> 01:55:31,160
Instead of doing that,
he kept arguing it.

2836
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:32,390
Yeah.
And I was like,

2837
01:55:32,391 --> 01:55:34,490
oh jesus.
And I contacted you afterwards.

2838
01:55:34,610 --> 01:55:36,170
Jesus bro.
This is rough.

2839
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:38,120
Well,
he is also were very nice about that.

2840
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:42,050
You were very nice to him while I was 
going on because it was fucking ugly and

2841
01:55:42,051 --> 01:55:43,850
you were very nice afterwards.
You didn't gloat.

2842
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:43,980
We

2843
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,840
had him back.
We had him back one time.

2844
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:49,200
Some common ground.
And you just get so mad.

2845
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:54,260
Yes.
Sally cone will you saying you don't 

2846
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:54,630
care about dead kid it got.
That's the motive thing that I'm talking

2847
01:55:54,631 --> 01:55:57,090
about.
I don't shy away from an emotive thing.

2848
01:55:57,091 --> 01:55:57,650
It was,
it was,

2849
01:55:57,690 --> 01:56:01,560
it was a conversational debate ploy is 
like he.

2850
01:56:01,561 --> 01:56:06,561
It was a crude debate,
but he's trying to box you into a 

2851
01:56:06,561 --> 01:56:09,891
corner.
I want to say this because I appreciate 

2852
01:56:09,891 --> 01:56:09,891
christopher titus and we've talked off 
air a nice guy.

2853
01:56:09,891 --> 01:56:12,540
Whereas someone like a Michael Woods 
junior who refused to come on the show,

2854
01:56:12,541 --> 01:56:15,840
try to leverage coming on this show to 
debate me is dishonest.

2855
01:56:16,230 --> 01:56:18,060
And someone who's afraid or michael,
ian black,

2856
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:23,370
uh,
who recently got into it with hopefully 

2857
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:23,370
he'll come on the show.
A lot of get there with him.

2858
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:25,470
Literally I was on air and all he did 
was.

2859
01:56:25,470 --> 01:56:27,210
We talked about this last time,
my video on rape culture.

2860
01:56:27,211 --> 01:56:31,110
You saw it with the lena dunham thing 
where it's one in four women are raped.

2861
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:36,500
And in the video I literally say,
I'm not saying rape is a horrible crime 

2862
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:36,500
and those people should be buried 
beneath the train tracks.

2863
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:37,410
Okay.
Okay.

2864
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:39,710
I'm also not apologizing for.
I literally say that in the video.

2865
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:40,230
Okay,
great.

2866
01:56:40,231 --> 01:56:45,231
Okay.
And then I get into the stats as to why 

2867
01:56:45,231 --> 01:56:45,231
rape culture doesn't exist in United 
States and it doesn't the middle east.

2868
01:56:45,570 --> 01:56:49,650
So all michael ian black tweets out is a
portion of that video,

2869
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:53,010
a snippet that is not the statistics 
that I present a snippet that's a sketch

2870
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:54,600
cutaway.
Just tweets out,

2871
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:56,860
holy shit.
And this is the thing that a lot,

2872
01:56:56,870 --> 01:57:00,380
if someone sent that to him,
if he got a clip clear,

2873
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:01,790
it goes further.
It's just tweets out,

2874
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:02,220
holy shit.

2875
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:03,150
And this is a constant thing,
right?

2876
01:57:03,151 --> 01:57:08,151
That often people who dIsagree with me 
politically who identify as a left go 

2877
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:10,230
creditor doesn't think there's a great 
culture.

2878
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:12,180
And so if they say it as though it's 
absurd enough,

2879
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:13,320
people go,
yeah,

2880
01:57:13,321 --> 01:57:14,730
that's silly.
But I say,

2881
01:57:14,731 --> 01:57:16,260
well hold on,
tell me why I'm wrong.

2882
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:17,280
And so I said,
well,

2883
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:18,720
come on the show,
tell me why I'm wrong.

2884
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:19,680
And he said,
well,

2885
01:57:19,681 --> 01:57:22,290
I wouldn't want to straight white guys 
debating rape culture.

2886
01:57:22,291 --> 01:57:27,291
I'd rather you talk with someone who's a
victim of rape or a woman would have a 

2887
01:57:27,291 --> 01:57:27,291
better handle on it.
So I said,

2888
01:57:27,291 --> 01:57:30,831
okay,
how about you talk with one of my two 

2889
01:57:30,831 --> 01:57:30,831
head writers,
casey or courtney?

2890
01:57:30,831 --> 01:57:31,230
They disagree with you.
They'll be glad to debate it.

2891
01:57:31,590 --> 01:57:32,730
no,
I don't think there's going to go.

2892
01:57:32,731 --> 01:57:37,731
and then I had to call them out on air 
to the point where he's agreed to come 

2893
01:57:37,731 --> 01:57:37,731
on next thursday.

2894
01:57:37,731 --> 01:57:38,850
But again,
the point is,

2895
01:57:39,150 --> 01:57:40,560
holy shit,
this is absurd.

2896
01:57:40,561 --> 01:57:45,561
Why is it absurd?
Tell me why it's I don't want to show 

2897
01:57:45,561 --> 01:57:45,561
up.
If you have to ask,

2898
01:57:45,561 --> 01:57:47,820
then you don't know and that's the 
position today that we see on cable news

2899
01:57:47,821 --> 01:57:52,821
that we see from in this election,
but you particularly see from people 

2900
01:57:52,821 --> 01:57:54,840
trying to silence dissent.
I love the idea of as a white man,

2901
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:57,360
you shouldn't be able to talk about the 
certain thing.

2902
01:57:57,540 --> 01:57:59,940
You should be able to talk about bugs on
jupiter.

2903
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:05,060
Okay.
It doesn't fucking matter what your 

2904
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:07,230
sexual orientation is,
what your gender is,

2905
01:58:07,231 --> 01:58:10,500
what your race is.
You should be able to talk about things.

2906
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:15,800
Just because you talk to somebody about 
something doesn't mean you the premier 

2907
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:18,120
expert of it to the premier,
your the premier expert of it.

2908
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:19,710
No,
you should be able to talk about things.

2909
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:24,740
I think you're right and that's a silly.
That's a silly way whether do you plead 

2910
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:26,620
to the left?
Yeah,

2911
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:30,030
it that that really is.
That's what that is,

2912
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:35,150
is you're saying things that you think 
people could possibly criticize you 

2913
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:39,351
about and you're cutting it off at the 
pass before they're preposterous ideas 

2914
01:58:39,351 --> 01:58:41,060
get to you and your twitter feed.
Well,

2915
01:58:41,650 --> 01:58:42,310
to me,
I mean,

2916
01:58:42,311 --> 01:58:47,311
like you said,
you disagree with people on certain 

2917
01:58:47,311 --> 01:58:47,311
things,
but you're not a coward ideologically.

2918
01:58:47,311 --> 01:58:50,821
I'm not about physically,
but you'll allow people on who you 

2919
01:58:50,821 --> 01:58:50,890
disagree with and you'll change your 
mind and I definitely changed my mind.

2920
01:58:50,891 --> 01:58:53,800
I'm not married to my ideas as much as I
get criticized for that.

2921
01:58:53,950 --> 01:58:54,640
No,
I think you're.

2922
01:58:54,730 --> 01:58:57,400
I think you're pretty consistent in that
and I think on the flip side,

2923
01:58:57,670 --> 01:58:58,720
what we try and do that I say,
listen,

2924
01:58:58,750 --> 01:58:59,560
this is my bias.

2925
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:01,870
This is what I believe.
What's your bIas on my body?

2926
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:02,860
And you said,
I'm right wing.

2927
01:59:02,910 --> 01:59:04,270
What do you sort of.
If you had to,

2928
01:59:04,271 --> 01:59:05,520
like,
if you go god damn minute,

2929
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:10,360
maybe I went too far down this road.
If I could just relax one aspect of my,

2930
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:12,520
my dialogue,
what would it be?

2931
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:18,480
Me.
It will be my pipe smoking your pipe 

2932
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:18,480
smoking.
Um,

2933
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:18,480
I probably,
you know,

2934
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:23,221
I probably wouldn't talk about the 
marijuana issue that I wouldn't care 

2935
01:59:23,221 --> 01:59:26,970
because here's the thIng,
I don't care about it one way or the 

2936
01:59:26,970 --> 01:59:27,800
other,
but my issue with it is when he saw some

2937
01:59:27,820 --> 01:59:28,870
montreal,
I talked about it.

2938
01:59:28,871 --> 01:59:33,871
When people lie about it and they're 
dishonest with their voting 

2939
01:59:33,871 --> 01:59:33,871
constituency.
Like how so?

2940
01:59:33,871 --> 01:59:38,760
Well saying you know,
it's medicine for abc or d and maybe 

2941
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:38,760
medicine for a but not for b,
c or d.

2942
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:39,120
Well,
what are the bs,

2943
01:59:39,121 --> 01:59:40,090
cs and ds.

2944
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:41,830
One of the things that's not medicine 
example.

2945
01:59:41,831 --> 01:59:44,530
Well you're asking me what I wouldn't 
talk about and asking me to defend it.

2946
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:46,090
The point is I don't really care about 
it,

2947
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:47,750
but what are the bcs and d,
what you,

2948
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:52,820
you said the answer is has been shown.
It helps with cancer,

2949
01:59:52,871 --> 01:59:56,220
about as much as tumeric and ginger.
Those things helps anti inflammatories,

2950
01:59:56,530 --> 02:00:00,670
but it's not a prescriptive.
Cbd has been shown to see tremendous,

2951
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:03,790
tremendous benefits for cancer and non 
psychoactive.

2952
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:04,930
Yeah,
and certainly with seizures,

2953
02:00:04,931 --> 02:00:09,010
I have zero problem with cbd cannabis,
but much of those little cannabis to.

2954
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:14,040
Yeah,
I feel the need to call people out and 

2955
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:14,040
bullshit when they say,
well,

2956
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:15,250
the reason it's not because of big 
pharmaceutical companies.

2957
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:15,850
Go,
hold on a second.

2958
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:18,550
There's seven patents on chemical 
compounds from marijuana right now.

2959
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:24,180
The people who stand to make the most 
out of marijuana legalization or 

2960
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:24,310
pharmaceutical companies,
that's why they make not true.

2961
02:00:24,370 --> 02:00:24,760
Well,
it is.

2962
02:00:24,761 --> 02:00:25,780
If you look at the biggest supplement 
now,

2963
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:28,660
but at the same pharmaceutical companies
can't pan the one.

2964
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:30,670
Yes you can.
They've patented seven,

2965
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:34,150
seven.
You leave terrains that gmos.

2966
02:00:34,210 --> 02:00:34,540
No,
no.

2967
02:00:34,870 --> 02:00:38,050
Seven active chemical compounds and pot 
that have been patented as drugs.

2968
02:00:38,350 --> 02:00:41,080
They've gone through the process.
Here's one that's really effIcient.

2969
02:00:41,110 --> 02:00:46,110
The point where you can't grow pot.
How would you stop someone if it's 

2970
02:00:46,110 --> 02:00:46,300
legal,
if pot's legal,

2971
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:48,910
how would anyone and if they.
If that's the truth,

2972
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:52,180
that's a real problem.
Pot is recognized as a medicine,

2973
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:57,360
right?
If potus recognize there's no one who 

2974
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:57,360
would stand to gain more than 
pharmaceutical companies by providing it

2975
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:59,470
as not necessarily true.
If people allowed to fail.

2976
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,240
It's not necessarIly true.
I'll give you that,

2977
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:06,360
but I also think it's not necessarily 
true that the reason people can't smoke 

2978
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:06,360
up is because big pharma is sitting 
somewhere,

2979
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:07,630
you know,
martin correctly going,

2980
02:01:07,670 --> 02:01:09,100
oh,
let's make potty illegal.

2981
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:10,750
Well,
not that's my only point,

2982
02:01:10,751 --> 02:01:15,751
but there are absolutely people who have
lobbied as we talked about how the 

2983
02:01:15,751 --> 02:01:18,610
prison guard union has lobbied to keep 
marijuana illegal.

2984
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:23,760
There's absolutely.
Pharmaceutical companies have done the 

2985
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:23,760
same thing.
It was revealed in the wiki leaks.

2986
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:23,760
Memo's.
See,

2987
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:25,840
this is what I was saying was told her,
I'm done interrupting you.

2988
02:01:25,841 --> 02:01:30,841
fuck where hillary clinton said that 
she's against marijuana in every sense 

2989
02:01:30,841 --> 02:01:30,841
of the word.
Right.

2990
02:01:30,841 --> 02:01:32,840
You remember those.
Those were pretty against it.

2991
02:01:32,990 --> 02:01:33,850
That came out.
Yeah.

2992
02:01:34,070 --> 02:01:39,070
Is he?
He said he would leave it up to the 

2993
02:01:39,070 --> 02:01:39,070
states.
Yeah.

2994
02:01:39,070 --> 02:01:39,070
That's actually a constitutional 
approach,

2995
02:01:39,070 --> 02:01:39,980
but he's pretty.
He wants to beef up the war

2996
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,060
on drugs.
You know why?

2997
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:46,240
I bet someone slipped him a pot cookie 
wants and he looked at his hair in the 

2998
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,960
mirror and know he's a teetotaler.
He didn't even drink vodka.

2999
02:01:47,961 --> 02:01:51,920
Doesn't drink Donald Trump ever.
Now he says he,

3000
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:56,510
Colorado topped 1 billion in legal 
marijuana sales in 2016.

3001
02:01:56,630 --> 02:01:59,510
Good holla.
Holla.

3002
02:01:59,570 --> 02:02:00,800
Colorado.
Yeah,

3003
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:02,630
but another thing that we just wrote 
about,

3004
02:02:02,631 --> 02:02:04,310
and again,
people get mad with the weed issue.

3005
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:04,940
Well no,
no.

3006
02:02:04,941 --> 02:02:07,370
A traffic fatalities regarding marijuana
have skyrocketed.

3007
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:13,760
Google that because that's nonsense.
No drunk driving arrest have dropped.

3008
02:02:13,790 --> 02:02:15,170
What do you mean you've what?
First of all,

3009
02:02:15,171 --> 02:02:16,840
I read about what the sources are 
original.

3010
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:21,190
Just because someone gets in an accident
and they're high.

3011
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:22,370
See,
hold on.

3012
02:02:22,430 --> 02:02:22,990
Stop.
No,

3013
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,730
no way too much.
And you stopped.

3014
02:02:26,290 --> 02:02:27,090
No,
no,

3015
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:27,470
no,
no,

3016
02:02:27,471 --> 02:02:28,760
no.
I don't talk about the graphs.

3017
02:02:28,761 --> 02:02:33,230
I make full points.
If people are high a lot,

3018
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:36,440
then the same amount of fatalities 
exist,

3019
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:41,710
but the people that get checked once 
they get into these accidents happened 

3020
02:02:42,201 --> 02:02:42,950
to be high.

3021
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:46,850
It does not necessarily mean that 
marijuana causes fatalities.

3022
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:52,030
It could be that you have an increased 
incidence of people doing marijuana and 

3023
02:02:52,030 --> 02:02:53,690
altercations that could not have been 
avoided.

3024
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:56,350
It could be,
it could be the statistical changes,

3025
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:59,990
measurable will what you're talking 
about In Colorado,

3026
02:03:00,100 --> 02:03:05,100
uh,
in states where it's been 

3027
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:05,100
decriminalized.
Go.

3028
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:07,001
It's Colorado.
Pull up jamie and all the sudden you 

3029
02:03:07,001 --> 02:03:07,001
just said,
let me make my point again.

3030
02:03:07,001 --> 02:03:07,520
My point is I don't care about it.
Yeah,

3031
02:03:07,521 --> 02:03:08,090
you do.
No,

3032
02:03:08,091 --> 02:03:10,250
I really don't.
You don't care about you sign up.

3033
02:03:10,430 --> 02:03:12,350
You get so touchy about it because 
someone says,

3034
02:03:12,351 --> 02:03:13,460
you know what,
if people want to smoke,

3035
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:18,500
fine.
I just don't really buy the arguments 

3036
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:18,500
that everyone is in some big conspiracy 
to try and sniff it out.

3037
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:18,880
No,
there aren't.

3038
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:22,010
And the Idea that the drug war will end 
and the idea that it's,

3039
02:03:22,011 --> 02:03:22,970
it's,
it's cures cancer.

3040
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:25,310
I just don't buy that and done so upset.
Well,

3041
02:03:25,311 --> 02:03:26,250
we'll listen.
Silence.

3042
02:03:26,730 --> 02:03:30,290
Wouldn't studies have proven that it 
shrinks tumors that it helps people with

3043
02:03:30,291 --> 02:03:32,090
cancer,
much like tumeric law,

3044
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:35,740
much like any things that reduce 
inflammation and community tart cherry.

3045
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:39,110
Right?
But it's not necessarily a shit.

3046
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:42,110
They're all legal and there's no issue 
because they're not psychoactive,

3047
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:43,880
right?
But there are beneficial,

3048
02:03:43,940 --> 02:03:48,940
so all these things are good.
marijuana is one of the things that are 

3049
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:49,040
good and don't sure,
man,

3050
02:03:49,041 --> 02:03:51,800
just like you don't sure to merrick,
you don't sure.

3051
02:03:51,801 --> 02:03:54,920
Ginger,
you don't sure a reduced sugar diet,

3052
02:03:54,950 --> 02:03:58,820
all those things that reduce 
inflammation or I don't buy that smoking

3053
02:03:58,821 --> 02:04:03,821
marijuana would be as beneficial as the 
reduced sugar diet and my point is that 

3054
02:04:03,821 --> 02:04:04,820
people might so offended that and sing,
but if you want to smoke,

3055
02:04:04,821 --> 02:04:06,350
go head,
you might be correct and be offended.

3056
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:11,350
IT doesn't matter because it's not a 
fucking contest to see what's the most 

3057
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:11,350
beneficial it.
The question is,

3058
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:12,950
is it beneficial and is it damaging?
It is.

3059
02:04:13,010 --> 02:04:15,170
It does matter.
The fact that.

3060
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:15,690
No,
let me,

3061
02:04:15,770 --> 02:04:17,050
let me finish my point.
It does matter.

3062
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:18,410
You said,
what would you not talk about?

3063
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:20,150
I said probably pot because I don't 
care.

3064
02:04:20,290 --> 02:04:20,930
Well,
what do you think?

3065
02:04:20,931 --> 02:04:25,931
You would definitely think about it and 
your eyes light up and all of a sudden 

3066
02:04:25,950 --> 02:04:28,930
krg and worldviews shouldn't be 
discussed.

3067
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:34,160
You're going like a tractor beam on the 
most important issue of the day that I 

3068
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:36,260
said I don't care.
You're the guy that thinks people should

3069
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:37,690
be able to do whatever your

3070
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,710
market guy.
So if you're a free market guy,

3071
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:44,400
why wouLdn't you be in support of some 
thing,

3072
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:48,210
whether it's the most beneficial or 
equally beneficial,

3073
02:04:48,450 --> 02:04:53,190
but you're not necessarily because 
you're denying chemical compound.

3074
02:04:53,290 --> 02:04:57,500
Fuck.
Face your friends.

3075
02:04:57,660 --> 02:05:02,660
I'm just joking.
Since marijuana legalization highway 

3076
02:05:02,660 --> 02:05:05,361
fatalities in Colorado or at rehab and 
bringing up the source that you want to 

3077
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:07,440
bring up the study right there.
Yeah,

3078
02:05:07,441 --> 02:05:08,940
Washington post's.
Bring up the study that we wrote.

3079
02:05:08,941 --> 02:05:10,230
We wrote about it on our website.
Look,

3080
02:05:10,231 --> 02:05:12,210
I don't care about your website.
You fuck.

3081
02:05:12,330 --> 02:05:17,330
Since marijuana legalization.
Highway fatalities in Colorado since you

3082
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:23,300
called me a fucking pussy and you do 
this with the crazy lady to comedy club.

3083
02:05:23,630 --> 02:05:25,370
You think if you scream enough that it 
makes it,

3084
02:05:25,371 --> 02:05:28,950
but my point is I don't care about that.
And you just said it was interrupting.

3085
02:05:28,951 --> 02:05:32,040
You're interrupting screaming because 
don't care about to put up a post,

3086
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:33,770
but I don't buy that.

3087
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:38,780
It's as valuable as a low sugar diet and
the fact that doesn't have to as value 

3088
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:40,050
can't have a conversation about this as 
civilly as he did.

3089
02:05:40,051 --> 02:05:43,320
Every other issue tells me that there's 
a problem.

3090
02:05:43,370 --> 02:05:48,370
This is tnt powder.
Can I get very defensive when people 

3091
02:05:48,631 --> 02:05:50,400
start talking over me and you started at
first,

3092
02:05:50,610 --> 02:05:53,850
but the reality is that it's a low sugar
diet is fine.

3093
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:57,570
It's good too,
but why is there a competition between a

3094
02:05:57,571 --> 02:06:01,860
low sugar diet and tumeric and marijuana
and cbd oil?

3095
02:06:01,861 --> 02:06:02,670
Why?
Why?

3096
02:06:02,730 --> 02:06:07,730
Why does making the claim regarding 
legality that it cures cancer.

3097
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:12,920
My only.
My only point is the other ones are 

3098
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:13,890
already legally don't have to fight for 
the ones prescribing.

3099
02:06:13,891 --> 02:06:16,080
No ones dishing out a dispensary for 
tumeric.

3100
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,460
Ginger.
They certainly are.

3101
02:06:17,461 --> 02:06:20,520
If you go to these local juice shop,
you go to these jews shops.

3102
02:06:20,521 --> 02:06:25,200
People are promoted with ginger tumeric 
like crazy people couldn't care less.

3103
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:27,150
People want to smoke joints.
You're An ideologue buddy.

3104
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:29,850
Really?
That's an ideologue position by saying,

3105
02:06:29,851 --> 02:06:30,830
leave it to the states.
Yeah,

3106
02:06:30,831 --> 02:06:31,280
you,
you're,

3107
02:06:31,370 --> 02:06:33,210
you're locked in man.
Really?

3108
02:06:33,330 --> 02:06:36,360
You locked deep into this fucking thing.
Man.

3109
02:06:36,630 --> 02:06:39,930
I was raised in a socialist province 
with bread is buttered buddy,

3110
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:43,920
a socialist province hand mirror over 
here in America.

3111
02:06:45,130 --> 02:06:48,930
Just as much of an immigrant is some 
dude who sneaks over the wall.

3112
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:52,140
Trump just built a porn in detroit,
so that remains to be seen.

3113
02:06:52,230 --> 02:06:56,250
It could be annexed,
so horrible.

3114
02:06:56,340 --> 02:07:01,340
Detroit.
Have you seen that thing where there is 

3115
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:03,030
a guy who is making a an urban farm in 
detroit?

3116
02:07:03,150 --> 02:07:04,560
Oh,
that's very common in detroit now.

3117
02:07:04,710 --> 02:07:06,720
Well,
he's kind of the largest urban farm.

3118
02:07:06,721 --> 02:07:09,480
Yeah.
He's bought up all this land and as he's

3119
02:07:09,481 --> 02:07:13,830
bought up all this land,
he's taking these dilapidated houses.

3120
02:07:13,831 --> 02:07:18,831
They tear them down,
is building this farm really cheap land 

3121
02:07:18,831 --> 02:07:18,831
and people are getting pissed off at 
them.

3122
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:21,750
They're getting pissed off because this 
one guy now buys all this land.

3123
02:07:21,751 --> 02:07:22,170
They're like,
well,

3124
02:07:22,171 --> 02:07:27,171
what about us and this?
This is weird thing that's going on 

3125
02:07:27,171 --> 02:07:30,531
where people somehow or another mad at 
this guy who was trying to do something 

3126
02:07:30,531 --> 02:07:31,020
positive,
if I'm not mistaken on that story,

3127
02:07:31,021 --> 02:07:33,360
I could be wrong,
but urban farming was a real.

3128
02:07:33,390 --> 02:07:35,380
We wrote about that when we did this 
report in detroit.

3129
02:07:35,381 --> 02:07:40,381
I was telling jamie about it beforehand.
We did a realtime right along because 

3130
02:07:40,381 --> 02:07:40,990
people said we selectively edited the 
worst parts of detroit,

3131
02:07:41,470 --> 02:07:43,030
so went back with my producer,
not gay yard.

3132
02:07:43,031 --> 02:07:43,540
We said,
okay,

3133
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:48,720
we're going to start dead center 
downtown detroit where all the hipsters 

3134
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:48,720
drink their coffee and talk about how 
it's being revived.

3135
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:50,890
We will drive out in three different 
directions.

3136
02:07:50,950 --> 02:07:53,920
We put a gopro on top of the car,
go pro in the car,

3137
02:07:54,190 --> 02:07:57,880
a mileage tab and a timer clock,
and it never took more than about,

3138
02:07:58,260 --> 02:08:03,260
I think,
point nine miles out of the city to 

3139
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:03,260
certain death and unbelievable urban 
plight.

3140
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:08,070
The crazy thing about detroit is you'll 
see downtown detroit and then you look 

3141
02:08:08,070 --> 02:08:08,260
to the left and it looks like the upper 
peninsula.

3142
02:08:08,261 --> 02:08:11,770
There's nothing there.
It's so desolate and if I'm not mistaken

3143
02:08:11,771 --> 02:08:14,650
with that story,
everyone was doing urban farming,

3144
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:19,680
but there were some problems with the 
soil and so it was a guy who probably 

3145
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:22,291
found out he could make money if he 
improved the soil and he got it down to 

3146
02:08:22,291 --> 02:08:24,871
a system that was more efficient and 
people didn't like that aspect of it 

3147
02:08:24,871 --> 02:08:25,750
because now it's the big urban farmer,
right?

3148
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:28,690
They're always so wealthy guy who bought
up a lot of land.

3149
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:30,910
Right.
And he's a white guy and he bought it up

3150
02:08:30,911 --> 02:08:31,780
in this,
you know,

3151
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:36,840
really urban area and you know,
the buildings were all fucked up and 

3152
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:40,741
somehow or another people felt like 
somebody was encroaching in their 

3153
02:08:40,741 --> 02:08:40,741
neighborhood that they had watched 
deteriorate.

3154
02:08:41,330 --> 02:08:44,390
I know in there there's no one there and
those names.

3155
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:49,400
Some people were there,
but the point is they felt like that 

3156
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:49,400
should have been somehow or another part
of their world,

3157
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:54,660
which is weird.
It's weird to think that you deserve 

3158
02:08:54,660 --> 02:08:57,511
somethIng because that's where you live.
I think like we were talking earlier 

3159
02:08:57,511 --> 02:09:01,111
about uber and all these things,
change is a real part of being an 

3160
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:05,100
organism that lives on a planet.
Right?

3161
02:09:05,110 --> 02:09:07,240
And whether it's changed because of 
nature,

3162
02:09:07,241 --> 02:09:09,940
like the fucking,
the shoreline changes,

3163
02:09:09,941 --> 02:09:13,240
the ocean rises,
tsunamis hit the coast,

3164
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:16,240
earthquakes changed the landscape.
What volcanoes,

3165
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:21,390
whether it's that kind of change or 
whether it's economic change or whether 

3166
02:09:21,390 --> 02:09:24,781
it's technological change,
there's going to be changed and if you 

3167
02:09:24,781 --> 02:09:25,360
try to stop change,
you're on the wrong side of history.

3168
02:09:25,361 --> 02:09:28,220
It's not gonna work.
You gotta you gotta try it.

3169
02:09:28,450 --> 02:09:30,040
It's eventually gonna overcome you.

3170
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:30,970
Yeah.
I think,

3171
02:09:30,990 --> 02:09:31,440
uh,
you know,

3172
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:35,260
my,
my view is you should allow people to be

3173
02:09:35,261 --> 02:09:38,650
the change they seek as barack obama put
it and it shouldn't try to force change.

3174
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:40,030
We,
if you live in a shitty neighborhood,

3175
02:09:40,031 --> 02:09:44,140
some dude wants a break down the,
the terrible houses and build a farm.

3176
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:46,570
that's not necessarily a bad idea.
No,

3177
02:09:46,571 --> 02:09:47,520
it's not at all.
Yeah.

3178
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:49,270
I mean they have,
when we did our video in detroit,

3179
02:09:49,271 --> 02:09:52,000
packs of wild dogs roaming the streets 
and it's real.

3180
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:52,750
Yeah.
That's real.

3181
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:55,120
That's real.
And we've got fact checked on it because

3182
02:09:55,121 --> 02:09:56,650
we did a video on this where we said,
you know,

3183
02:09:56,651 --> 02:10:01,651
packs of.
And then I made a joke where I said 

3184
02:10:01,651 --> 02:10:01,651
apparently there've been grizzly bear 
sightings,

3185
02:10:01,651 --> 02:10:03,610
so hopefully this will be our next 
national geographic specials.

3186
02:10:03,611 --> 02:10:05,620
So That doesn't bear sightings.
Right.

3187
02:10:05,650 --> 02:10:07,970
But I got fact checked.
I don't know if it was back then.

3188
02:10:07,970 --> 02:10:12,970
It,
I don't remember if it was snopes or 

3189
02:10:12,970 --> 02:10:12,970
something.
Someone's saying.

3190
02:10:12,970 --> 02:10:12,970
Steven crowder made the claim that 
grizzly bears were in detroit.

3191
02:10:12,990 --> 02:10:16,930
Facts check reveals that only black 
bears have been sitting there like,

3192
02:10:17,580 --> 02:10:22,580
well,
you should fact check them because blue 

3193
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:23,650
black bears are more lIkely to be 
predatory on human beings.

3194
02:10:23,651 --> 02:10:28,651
Then grizzly bears.
This is because of more common 

3195
02:10:28,651 --> 02:10:28,651
interactions though.
Statistically,

3196
02:10:28,651 --> 02:10:28,651
you're very smart.
You're right.

3197
02:10:28,651 --> 02:10:33,150
That's right.
Kinda like sharks that occurs in three 

3198
02:10:33,150 --> 02:10:33,150
to four feet of water.
That's where people are swimming.

3199
02:10:33,150 --> 02:10:33,770
Exactly.
Um,

3200
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:37,100
but that is the case with grizzly.
Grizzly bears are way more aggressive,

3201
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,600
but they don't necessarily associate 
human beings with food.

3202
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,790
Are you supposed to play dead?
Are run wIth a grizzly bear?

3203
02:10:43,791 --> 02:10:44,710
You wouldn't know that.
Probably.

3204
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:47,570
It depends entirely on why the grizzly 
bears attacking you.

3205
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:53,440
The reality is,
if a grizzly bear is attacking you 

3206
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:54,800
because she's with her cubs,
you're better off playing dead.

3207
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:57,740
You're better off covering up,
texting your vitals,

3208
02:10:57,741 --> 02:11:02,741
getting the turtle position,
and taking your beatings and she's your 

3209
02:11:02,741 --> 02:11:02,741
ass.
Goodbye.

3210
02:11:02,741 --> 02:11:06,070
She's gonna fuck you up,
but she might leave you alone if you 

3211
02:11:06,070 --> 02:11:06,070
just lay still and then she feels like 
she can run away.

3212
02:11:06,070 --> 02:11:06,770
She's gonna.
Fuck you up.

3213
02:11:06,771 --> 02:11:09,050
No matter what,
she's going to incapacitate you,

3214
02:11:09,230 --> 02:11:14,230
but if an old male or a predatory male 
that has killed another human being and 

3215
02:11:15,981 --> 02:11:20,981
recognize as human beings is food that 
has happened before where hikers have 

3216
02:11:20,981 --> 02:11:25,751
disappeared and hikers disappear all the
time to the tune of hundreds of people 

3217
02:11:27,410 --> 02:11:32,410
every year just vanish.
I read that actually polar bears will 

3218
02:11:32,410 --> 02:11:32,750
stalk people.
Well,

3219
02:11:32,751 --> 02:11:36,470
that's a different animal.
Polar bears or completely predatory,

3220
02:11:36,770 --> 02:11:38,870
which means they don't eat any 
vegetation.

3221
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:41,620
You can get lucky with grizzly bears.
What?

3222
02:11:41,621 --> 02:11:46,621
Grizzly bears can have a fucking field 
of blueberries and they don't want to 

3223
02:11:46,621 --> 02:11:48,020
have anything to do with you because 
blueberries are delicious.

3224
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:53,020
They don't run and they Could just sit 
there and eat and they don't have any 

3225
02:11:53,020 --> 02:11:53,020
hunger pangs.
Really?

3226
02:11:53,020 --> 02:11:54,080
Yeah.
How many blueberries would it take?

3227
02:11:54,081 --> 02:11:54,940
The feet of grizzlies?
Well,

3228
02:11:54,941 --> 02:11:56,570
does she know you're talking about 
Alaska,

3229
02:11:56,571 --> 02:12:00,050
like a mountain side,
like in the spring or in the fall,

3230
02:12:00,051 --> 02:12:02,990
rather like before they go into 
hibernation.

3231
02:12:02,991 --> 02:12:07,991
That'S what they primarily eat because 
all that sugar just gets like straight 

3232
02:12:07,991 --> 02:12:10,100
into the fat.
Their bodies and they store it up big,

3233
02:12:10,101 --> 02:12:11,360
thick,
fat layers,

3234
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:17,080
but an animal that has already killed a 
person is where it becomes a real 

3235
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:20,231
problem.
It's not that animals are evil or 

3236
02:12:20,231 --> 02:12:23,021
animals like target people.
It's they recognize food sources that 

3237
02:12:23,181 --> 02:12:28,181
they've already eaten.
Did you see those people who were 

3238
02:12:28,181 --> 02:12:28,181
protesting?
They were really mad.

3239
02:12:28,181 --> 02:12:32,741
The rangers that yellowstone park,
so they're very strict that you cannot 

3240
02:12:32,741 --> 02:12:33,770
feed the bears.
You can then interact with them and what

3241
02:12:33,771 --> 02:12:36,380
they do is they had a bear that wasn't 
necessarily aggressive,

3242
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:41,720
but they do this all the time,
but there was some specific instance 

3243
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:41,720
that piss people off.

3244
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:45,460
Wasn't necessarily being aggressive,
but learn that people would throw food 

3245
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:45,460
at it,
and so we're going,

3246
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:46,190
well not only can we not have that bear 
doing it,

3247
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:48,290
but we can't have other bears seeing 
that bear as an example.

3248
02:12:48,530 --> 02:12:53,530
So what they do,
their first ep has taken the bear far 

3249
02:12:53,530 --> 02:12:53,530
away.
You know,

3250
02:12:53,530 --> 02:12:53,530
somehow transporting them,
a sedating them,

3251
02:12:53,530 --> 02:12:56,880
and if it comes back either a second or 
third time they euthanized.

3252
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,940
They have to.
And all of these people were furious.

3253
02:12:58,941 --> 02:12:59,180
No,
no,

3254
02:12:59,200 --> 02:13:04,200
no.
We're doing this that the bears don't 

3255
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:05,801
become dependent on humans for food.
If euthanize one barrier that prevents 

3256
02:13:05,801 --> 02:13:07,790
the rest of them,
the they no longer can forage,

3257
02:13:07,791 --> 02:13:12,791
can hunt for themselves because they 
realize these people are gonna throw us 

3258
02:13:12,791 --> 02:13:15,221
a sandwich.
And that's a great example of just 

3259
02:13:15,221 --> 02:13:17,800
people not knowing,
not being informed enough on an on an 

3260
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:17,800
issue and instead deciding to be 
outraged.

3261
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:18,980
Like,
I don't know about grizzly bears.

3262
02:13:18,981 --> 02:13:22,550
They assume the yellowstone rangers kind
of have their crap together on it.

3263
02:13:22,580 --> 02:13:23,760
Well,
that's also like peta,

3264
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:28,780
people that don't want to admit that 
peta kills thousands of cats and dogs 

3265
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:30,590
every year and their heads a diabetic 
who uses insulin,

3266
02:13:30,591 --> 02:13:32,130
which came to courtesy of animal 
testing,

3267
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:35,970
but she feels like that's okay because 
she's a vegan,

3268
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:42,260
she's skinny fat,
but there's a great podcast that's 

3269
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:45,321
available right now,
the most recent meat eater podcast with 

3270
02:13:45,321 --> 02:13:48,801
steve rinella,
where he talks to a bear biologist who 

3271
02:13:48,801 --> 02:13:50,670
discusses the history of yellowstone at 
one point in time,

3272
02:13:51,090 --> 02:13:56,090
the dumps where people in restaurants 
used to dump all their food was places 

3273
02:13:56,090 --> 02:13:58,380
where people would go to watch to watch 
bear.

3274
02:13:58,381 --> 02:14:00,530
We Did it at a campground.
There was like,

3275
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:01,890
well,
what year was this?

3276
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:03,030
Gosh,
nineties.

3277
02:14:03,370 --> 02:14:05,190
Where were you not in yellowstone?

3278
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:06,090
No,
this wasn't Canada.

3279
02:14:06,150 --> 02:14:11,150
Okay.
They'd already made it illegal in 

3280
02:14:11,150 --> 02:14:11,150
yellowstone I barriers when we went.
We just drove by.

3281
02:14:11,150 --> 02:14:11,150
There was no one,
but it's like,

3282
02:14:11,150 --> 02:14:12,210
yeah,
if you go down under this area,

3283
02:14:12,211 --> 02:14:15,220
it's really cool.
You get to see the bears foraging thing.

3284
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:20,280
In yelloWstone it was one of the main,
like mortality,

3285
02:14:21,271 --> 02:14:26,271
like if you look at mortality events,
it was a huge mortality event because 

3286
02:14:26,271 --> 02:14:28,890
they went cold Turkey,
they stopped dumping all the trash there

3287
02:14:29,070 --> 02:14:34,070
and these bands had become acclimated so
much so that they had stopped learning 

3288
02:14:34,070 --> 02:14:37,310
how to forage for food and bears died.
Like unmask.

3289
02:14:37,370 --> 02:14:38,670
Yeah,
it's really kind of crazy.

3290
02:14:39,030 --> 02:14:44,030
That's also the flip side with a rescue 
dog where I tell people like we have a 

3291
02:14:44,030 --> 02:14:44,250
rescue dog and people get so offended 
really say,

3292
02:14:44,251 --> 02:14:47,340
but if you have kids,
probably better to go from a breeder,

3293
02:14:47,341 --> 02:14:49,530
you know,
because for example,

3294
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:51,470
hopper on the road,
we don't know,

3295
02:14:51,471 --> 02:14:52,520
you know,
we don't know what happened to me.

3296
02:14:52,530 --> 02:14:55,380
Happens to me the most affectIonate,
loving dog that we've known,

3297
02:14:55,650 --> 02:15:00,650
but a dog like that,
that starving can learn to become much 

3298
02:15:00,650 --> 02:15:00,650
more of a wild dog,
you know,

3299
02:15:00,650 --> 02:15:02,340
that can be trained in them because 
they're scared.

3300
02:15:02,350 --> 02:15:04,870
They're scared and you bring them in.
For example,

3301
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:09,240
he gets recall any gun ever since we've 
had him any handgun,

3302
02:15:09,270 --> 02:15:10,350
rifle,
pull it out,

3303
02:15:11,060 --> 02:15:12,870
goes nuts.
So he's seen guns.

3304
02:15:12,871 --> 02:15:15,390
He seen something in a negative 
connotation with guns.

3305
02:15:15,690 --> 02:15:18,300
You can't know that,
so if you have some kid and he pulls out

3306
02:15:18,301 --> 02:15:19,710
a squirt gun,
now he's not aggressive.

3307
02:15:19,711 --> 02:15:24,711
He's just a bark.
If he doesn't like something and people 

3308
02:15:24,711 --> 02:15:28,360
have.
I don't know if it was to some animal 

3309
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:28,360
person got really mad.
Well,

3310
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:28,360
well there are so many dogs that need 
homes going.

3311
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:28,860
Listen,
I've rescued a dog.

3312
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:30,780
I think if you know what you're 
handling,

3313
02:15:31,140 --> 02:15:36,140
you should if you're able,
but if you have kids who don't have a 

3314
02:15:36,140 --> 02:15:36,480
lot of dog training and you don't know 
where this dogs come from,

3315
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:40,270
I placed kids higher on the totem pole 
than dog.

3316
02:15:40,270 --> 02:15:41,600
How dare you?
A species.

3317
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:44,010
A species is.
That's a new thing.

3318
02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:45,810
It isn't there.
Speciesism,

3319
02:15:45,811 --> 02:15:47,250
when we were kids,
jamie,

3320
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:52,600
you're younger.
There was a fiLm species where that 

3321
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:52,600
blonde chick that's different.
Which he go,

3322
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:53,700
she quit.
I don't know.

3323
02:15:53,701 --> 02:15:55,260
She's probably doing softcore 
pornography.

3324
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,930
How dare you.
Maybe she's writing books.

3325
02:15:58,940 --> 02:16:00,510
Well,
the the grid,

3326
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:05,570
so I didn't know that.
I've never thought of black bears as 

3327
02:16:05,570 --> 02:16:05,570
being aggressive toward people.
Yeah,

3328
02:16:05,570 --> 02:16:06,220
man,
I rinella.

3329
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:11,240
The same guy who has the podcast I was 
talking about told me a story of a guy 

3330
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:13,470
who went on his very first hunt and 
while he was in his tent,

3331
02:16:13,770 --> 02:16:17,130
a 500 pound predatory grizzly bear 
attacked him.

3332
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:20,490
His friend shot the bear and hit him in 
the wrist.

3333
02:16:20,670 --> 02:16:22,560
The bear takes off,
out of the tent,

3334
02:16:22,561 --> 02:16:26,400
goes to another dude's 10 and they shoot
it in that tent to kill it.

3335
02:16:26,730 --> 02:16:29,620
So everyone's covered in blood and hair 
and it didn't kill it.

3336
02:16:29,650 --> 02:16:30,400
Yeah,
they killed it,

3337
02:16:30,401 --> 02:16:33,430
but I mean the guy had a bullet wound in
his wrist.

3338
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:38,680
He had been mauled by this bear.
I mean this is first hunting trip ever.

3339
02:16:39,430 --> 02:16:41,740
Could you see the reverend?
Yes.

3340
02:16:42,910 --> 02:16:47,910
Remember that there was a rumor before 
that film came out that leonardo 

3341
02:16:47,910 --> 02:16:47,910
dicaprio gets raped by the bear.
Did you read that?

3342
02:16:47,910 --> 02:16:50,830
That was front page and are on the wrong
website.

3343
02:16:50,890 --> 02:16:55,890
It was frontpage at exactly the wrong 
side and I remember thinking about that 

3344
02:16:56,201 --> 02:16:57,310
number,
watching it going.

3345
02:16:57,670 --> 02:17:02,670
This is an example of fake news,
whether it's the right or the left is 

3346
02:17:02,670 --> 02:17:02,670
going.
This is clearly not a bear rape scene,

3347
02:17:02,670 --> 02:17:04,650
but it was a huge rumor that was going 
around because it don't.

3348
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:10,180
Don't go see.
The rep was in huge enough to reach mY 

3349
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:10,180
twitter page.

3350
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:11,300
You have a big twitter page just to into
it,

3351
02:17:11,301 --> 02:17:14,890
man.
You too deep into the news of the world.

3352
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:18,970
I told this story to chris leaving at 
the reverend reverend revenue revenue,

3353
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,650
revenue revenue.
So we're there.

3354
02:17:20,710 --> 02:17:21,940
This is,
I swear this is true.

3355
02:17:22,030 --> 02:17:24,610
And crystal even thought it was fake and
fake it.

3356
02:17:24,611 --> 02:17:29,611
So we're watching the revenant and it's 
right at that scene where he cauterizes 

3357
02:17:29,611 --> 02:17:29,611
as wound and with the gunpowder on his 
neck.

3358
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:32,220
So we're sitting there and we're 
watching it and,

3359
02:17:32,370 --> 02:17:34,900
and he's screaming and so for a second 
we didn't realize it.

3360
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:40,440
A few rows down.
A guys all of a sudden starts projectile

3361
02:17:41,591 --> 02:17:46,591
vomiting wildly and I was on three 
months and we're looking and we're 

3362
02:17:46,901 --> 02:17:47,380
going,
oh my god,

3363
02:17:47,381 --> 02:17:49,390
we think you starts shaking.
We think he's having a seizure.

3364
02:17:49,510 --> 02:17:50,950
My wife being a sweeter goes,
okay,

3365
02:17:50,951 --> 02:17:54,370
everybody move away.
Someone called nine slash 11 and his,

3366
02:17:54,490 --> 02:17:55,480
his wife or his girlfriend.

3367
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:55,870
I was like,
sweetie,

3368
02:17:55,871 --> 02:17:59,110
are you,
and it's going down to rose.

3369
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:00,370
We,
I go,

3370
02:18:00,371 --> 02:18:01,900
I wait for the ambulance that they come 
in.

3371
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:06,960
The guy has vomit all over him.
I think someone who's sitting in front 

3372
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:07,210
of the bottom on the back of his head,
they thought for sure he had a seizure.

3373
02:18:07,211 --> 02:18:11,190
Turns out he'd fallen asleep and inhaled
a popcorn kernel [inaudible],

3374
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:16,680
and he was just choking and then free 
time and then aspirating on his own 

3375
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:17,080
vomit.
So we're watching this film,

3376
02:18:17,081 --> 02:18:22,081
the revenue,
one of the most graphic scenes in 

3377
02:18:22,081 --> 02:18:23,650
cinematic modern history,
facts and evidence.

3378
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:25,870
What the hell is going on?
Wow.

3379
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:27,490
And a coincidence.
Yeah,

3380
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:28,990
and it was.
I mean the guy was embarrassed.

3381
02:18:29,020 --> 02:18:30,640
He just fell asleep.
It's not a cool story.

3382
02:18:30,641 --> 02:18:33,430
I've amassed.
It was a scene like a.

3383
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:37,090
You remember that movie?
What was that movie with matt?

3384
02:18:37,091 --> 02:18:38,890
damon?
Matt dillon.

3385
02:18:39,340 --> 02:18:42,940
What was the movie where the two girls 
were making out by the pool?

3386
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:44,960
Stranger?
No.

3387
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:46,060
Oh.
Oh,

3388
02:18:46,061 --> 02:18:48,000
wild things with things.
yeah.

3389
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:53,160
What if he watched that movie and one of
that scene was going down and that 

3390
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:55,960
popcorn kernel got stuck in his mouth.
They started projectile vomiting.

3391
02:18:55,990 --> 02:18:58,270
Why would that be worse?
It'd be way worse.

3392
02:18:58,330 --> 02:19:03,330
Just be making sense.
I like the guy has scared the berries 

3393
02:19:03,330 --> 02:19:04,930
killing leonardo dicaprio.
No,

3394
02:19:04,931 --> 02:19:06,870
don't kill leo.
No,

3395
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,910
don't do it to him.
He's the king of the world.

3396
02:19:10,060 --> 02:19:12,070
He's in the front of the fucking 
titanic.

3397
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:13,660
Don't,
don't do it.

3398
02:19:13,890 --> 02:19:16,420
you know,
people freak out and like a bear attack.

3399
02:19:16,450 --> 02:19:18,430
But if you're freaking out like a 
lesbian event,

3400
02:19:18,620 --> 02:19:23,620
it turns out just coincidentally,
just the story people are going to tell 

3401
02:19:23,620 --> 02:19:24,540
about you for the rest of your life.
Now,

3402
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:29,090
bobby saw these two broads making out 
there will hopped on his loan.

3403
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:33,020
He's alarms by himself.
We just started hurling changes.

3404
02:19:33,021 --> 02:19:35,520
Lifepro city chosen popcorn.
But we know that.

3405
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:37,700
Oh my gosh,
I've never,

3406
02:19:38,220 --> 02:19:39,130
I've never seen it.
Like,

3407
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:44,160
I mean from here to that buddha statue 
taken the kid in the pie eating contest 

3408
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:46,520
and that Stephen King boomi stand by me.
Remember that?

3409
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:47,720
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3410
02:19:47,860 --> 02:19:52,860
Very pie contest.
I went to this this worse because it 

3411
02:19:52,860 --> 02:19:54,380
wasn't like a flow.
It was pressurized.

3412
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:56,210
It's funny because he was also holding 
his mouth.

3413
02:19:56,630 --> 02:19:58,310
So it's coming on,
you know,

3414
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:03,520
like this where it's going to squirt and
so was it when he fell asleep with a 

3415
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:06,401
popcorn kernel,
his mouth at the revenue in the middle 

3416
02:20:06,401 --> 02:20:07,400
of that fucking really exciting movie in
the middle of that scene.

3417
02:20:07,401 --> 02:20:09,620
Right where he's cauterizes the wound in
his neck.

3418
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:14,880
Fuck.
I felt bad for them and I imagine that 

3419
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:14,880
if that,
if that wasn't his wife that was,

3420
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:18,880
wasn't as fiance,
there's a good chance theY're not 

3421
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:20,741
together.
Did you think that movie was based on 

3422
02:20:20,741 --> 02:20:20,741
real life events?
Have no idea.

3423
02:20:20,741 --> 02:20:23,810
Was it supposedly but incorrectly?
Oh really?

3424
02:20:23,870 --> 02:20:25,970
Yeah.
It's not so much a sound check.

3425
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:30,980
I think they already have.
Oh really didn't happen in an 

3426
02:20:30,980 --> 02:20:32,270
environment.
Anything like the environment.

3427
02:20:32,271 --> 02:20:37,271
They filmed it in and they filmed it in 
this like tropical rain forest in 

3428
02:20:37,271 --> 02:20:38,990
british columbia.
The guy never had a son.

3429
02:20:38,991 --> 02:20:41,480
When leonardo dicaprio son is killed in 
front of them.

3430
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:44,030
The only thing that was true it was the 
guy got mauled by a bear,

3431
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:44,840
made it back to camp.

3432
02:20:49,450 --> 02:20:52,040
They left him for dead.
He actually survived.

3433
02:20:52,041 --> 02:20:53,090
You made it back to camp.
That's.

3434
02:20:53,091 --> 02:20:53,900
And he's like,
what the fuck,

3435
02:20:53,901 --> 02:20:54,530
bro?
The guy was like,

3436
02:20:54,531 --> 02:20:55,400
sorry,
I thought you were dead.

3437
02:20:55,560 --> 02:20:57,140
That's it.
That's the movie.

3438
02:20:57,540 --> 02:21:02,540
But in the entire cast,
caesar was the lead up to the bear 

3439
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:03,530
attack and it was him going back and 
killing the guy left him behind.

3440
02:21:03,531 --> 02:21:06,080
You also killed his son.
No son,

3441
02:21:06,081 --> 02:21:09,710
nobody killed anybody.
He got fucked up by a bear and they left

3442
02:21:09,711 --> 02:21:11,090
him alone.
That's interesting.

3443
02:21:11,091 --> 02:21:12,050
When you think about that,
you know,

3444
02:21:12,051 --> 02:21:15,430
you go back and I'm like,
weston price,

3445
02:21:15,470 --> 02:21:20,470
not western price foundation for they do
like the fermented cod liver oil and 

3446
02:21:20,470 --> 02:21:23,531
stuff and they,
they're a big catalyst for like eating 

3447
02:21:23,531 --> 02:21:23,570
real fats and stuff.
And the guy claimed were this,

3448
02:21:23,571 --> 02:21:28,010
what does the weston a price foundation 
and we're advert advocates,

3449
02:21:28,011 --> 02:21:30,320
traditional order along around for a 
long time.

3450
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:31,050
yeah.
Guy.

3451
02:21:31,070 --> 02:21:32,820
I think his name is weston price and 
that,

3452
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:34,550
because I always watched those movies 
like the revenant and I go,

3453
02:21:34,551 --> 02:21:37,100
could you imagine how much it smelled or
imagine what their teeth were like.

3454
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:40,950
But this guy claimed he went down to,
uh,

3455
02:21:41,140 --> 02:21:41,560
like,
you know,

3456
02:21:41,660 --> 02:21:44,660
third world sort of african nations 
where they didn't brush their teeth,

3457
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:49,840
but they had perfect smiles.
Any claims it was because I don't know 

3458
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:49,840
how,
I don't know if it's true at all,

3459
02:21:50,090 --> 02:21:55,090
but he says it was because they ate a 
lot of organ meats that are gettIng a 

3460
02:21:55,090 --> 02:21:57,791
lot of vitamin k natural vitamin d as 
opposed to kind of the sugary lifestyle 

3461
02:21:57,951 --> 02:22:00,770
with refined carbohydrates in the new 
world.

3462
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:03,200
Um,
and that's a big part of this whole kind

3463
02:22:03,201 --> 02:22:07,820
of high saturated fat.
Oregon's a bone broths.

3464
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:12,230
It's called the weston price foundation.
But I remember there were these pictures

3465
02:22:12,231 --> 02:22:17,231
side by side of people in the new world.
We're in largely grain fed diets and 

3466
02:22:17,231 --> 02:22:17,960
these people who were basically third 
world sort of tribesmen,

3467
02:22:17,961 --> 02:22:19,780
but that these beautiful white teeth.
No,

3468
02:22:19,830 --> 02:22:24,830
make sense in some ways that people that
live natural lives with natural foods 

3469
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:25,970
without anything

3470
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:28,320
processed would be healthier.
Yeah.

3471
02:22:28,321 --> 02:22:31,800
but the teeth and they were a nice white
teeth look better for sure,

3472
02:22:31,801 --> 02:22:34,500
is definitely deteriorates your teeth.
We know that.

3473
02:22:34,530 --> 02:22:39,530
We know that should keep kids.
We had a lot of sugar and don't brush 

3474
02:22:39,530 --> 02:22:41,961
their teeth,
and I think a lot of that is also that 

3475
02:22:41,961 --> 02:22:43,731
stuff getting caught in your gums and 
your teeth and just not good causes 

3476
02:22:43,731 --> 02:22:45,180
causes tooth decay.
We know that.

3477
02:22:45,260 --> 02:22:50,260
Yep,
and the worst thing is a sugar free 

3478
02:22:50,260 --> 02:22:50,260
gummy bears.
You read those reviews and amazon god,

3479
02:22:50,260 --> 02:22:55,221
what do they do to your asshole?
That's exactly what the reviews on 

3480
02:22:55,221 --> 02:22:55,221
amazon.
I swear to you,

3481
02:22:55,221 --> 02:22:56,600
if you just google sugar free gummy 
bears,

3482
02:22:56,630 --> 02:22:59,820
just like my asshole has never been the 
same size since.

3483
02:22:59,850 --> 02:23:04,850
It's just a bunch of people who tRolled 
the amazon review section for if you're 

3484
02:23:04,850 --> 02:23:06,630
ever looking for a laugh on a sunday 
afternoon,

3485
02:23:06,900 --> 02:23:10,350
read the amazon reviews for sugar free,
haribo gummy.

3486
02:23:10,610 --> 02:23:15,610
Remember olestra,
there was an additive to like potato 

3487
02:23:15,610 --> 02:23:16,500
chips,
a less traditional banks,

3488
02:23:16,501 --> 02:23:19,720
people just rocket shit.
Other asshole.

3489
02:23:21,110 --> 02:23:22,950
They allow it.
No.

3490
02:23:23,610 --> 02:23:26,850
Well,
trans fats are now they're illegal,

3491
02:23:26,851 --> 02:23:30,510
but you have they ever.
There's a grace period until 2018,

3492
02:23:30,511 --> 02:23:35,511
I believe,
or maybe 19 where companies are allowed 

3493
02:23:35,511 --> 02:23:38,070
to still use that stuff and their potato
chips or wherever the fuck they sell.

3494
02:23:38,071 --> 02:23:39,990
Up until then,
like that's it,

3495
02:23:40,050 --> 02:23:41,970
like you can poison people for two more 
years.

3496
02:23:42,030 --> 02:23:42,930
That's it.
Well,

3497
02:23:42,931 --> 02:23:47,931
you know why we use terrible for you 
because of the same environmental 

3498
02:23:47,931 --> 02:23:51,140
vegetarian lobby.
Who back then mcdonald's used beef 

3499
02:23:51,140 --> 02:23:51,140
tallow fries.
It was,

3500
02:23:51,140 --> 02:23:51,140
no,
no,

3501
02:23:51,140 --> 02:23:53,660
you need to be using vegetable oil,
hydrogenated vegetable oils.

3502
02:23:53,661 --> 02:23:55,780
So that was a bunch of lobbyists.
You know,

3503
02:23:55,890 --> 02:23:57,840
that's why we started eating trans fats 
and now they're going,

3504
02:23:57,900 --> 02:24:02,250
actually margarine is not as good for 
you as butter and they've changed,

3505
02:24:02,251 --> 02:24:05,190
but that was a huge powerful lobbying 
group for the vegetarians.

3506
02:24:05,190 --> 02:24:07,230
You know,
the san francisco kind of hippie era.

3507
02:24:07,410 --> 02:24:09,750
That's why trans fats became ubiquitous.
Well,

3508
02:24:09,751 --> 02:24:14,751
it was also a byproduct of the sugar 
industry driving scientists to lie about

3509
02:24:15,630 --> 02:24:20,630
the beneficial qualities of their sugar 
and they just pretended that sugar's 

3510
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:25,590
fine when you born with it saturated 
fat,

3511
02:24:25,591 --> 02:24:27,300
that's the issue and everybody wants 
shit.

3512
02:24:27,301 --> 02:24:28,750
We got to get some margarine.
Yeah.

3513
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:33,780
These people went out and bought margin 
because it terrified of saturated fat 

3514
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:36,740
because the sugar companies had bribed.
Some scientists were that when we were 

3515
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:39,471
kids,
country crock margarine and we didn't 

3516
02:24:39,471 --> 02:24:41,000
feel so bad for you.
It's interesting now that that's been 

3517
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,180
revealed and you find out that those 
people didn't even get that much money.

3518
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:47,480
They got like the equivalent of $50,000
today,

3519
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:52,670
right?
To literallY lie to everybody about the.

3520
02:24:54,320 --> 02:24:57,740
They just made up a bunch of shit about 
saturated fat and they,

3521
02:24:57,770 --> 02:25:01,530
they just diminished all the negative 
effects of sugar and people just started

3522
02:25:01,531 --> 02:25:05,250
drinking that.
That milk from a captain crunch.

3523
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:10,280
Remember that milk when you get that 
fucking sugary captain crunch milk or 

3524
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:10,280
delicious,
it's absolutely delicious.

3525
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:12,030
You get the chocolate milk at a coco 
pops.

3526
02:25:12,060 --> 02:25:14,040
Oh my god,
count chocula.

3527
02:25:14,310 --> 02:25:18,270
Oh my jesus.
we grew up on sugar.

3528
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:20,430
I know in Canada we,
uh,

3529
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:25,460
we had a whole different.
I didn't realize till I moved to the 

3530
02:25:25,460 --> 02:25:25,460
states.
Corn pops in Canada

3531
02:25:25,460 --> 02:25:26,170
are actually like spherical captain 
crunch.

3532
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:27,820
They're not at all like corn pops in the
states.

3533
02:25:28,270 --> 02:25:33,270
Is there a lot of little differences 
because it's such a silly country where 

3534
02:25:33,270 --> 02:25:33,910
you'll be raised there and you'll come 
here and like,

3535
02:25:33,911 --> 02:25:38,911
wait,
aren't the same super sugar crisp had 

3536
02:25:38,911 --> 02:25:39,130
sugar in the title.
That's right.

3537
02:25:39,131 --> 02:25:40,630
That was the sugar bear,
right?

3538
02:25:40,690 --> 02:25:41,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

3539
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:44,650
It wasn't bad enough of that sugar.
That's right.

3540
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:49,680
Super sugar crisp.
You imagine you have a god damned drug 

3541
02:25:50,381 --> 02:25:52,450
in the name of your look at.
There you go.

3542
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:55,570
That is crazy exist.
It's not even good.

3543
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:58,980
It's illegal.
you go to jail if you even sell that.

3544
02:26:00,430 --> 02:26:01,960
Does the sugar bear?
I'm here.

3545
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:04,800
I'm in sugar.
the sugar chris.

3546
02:26:05,980 --> 02:26:07,670
Chris.
Some differences in sugar.

3547
02:26:08,870 --> 02:26:13,870
I'm of strange mongoose.
I'm a mongoose with a tee shirt off.

3548
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:19,780
Then there was cookie crisp cookies in 
milk,

3549
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:23,680
but then it was reese's puffs cereal.
Look at that one smacks.

3550
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:27,520
They have an indian cultural 
appropriation that today.

3551
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:32,670
Look at that.
What does that have to do with a native 

3552
02:26:32,670 --> 02:26:32,670
american?
What smacks?

3553
02:26:32,670 --> 02:26:36,090
It's kinda like latino selling cars.
They just put tits on it because it 

3554
02:26:36,090 --> 02:26:37,660
sells in their culture.
Inside is a free indian car.

3555
02:26:37,661 --> 02:26:40,780
That's a special indian it.
She doesn't make an acceptable.

3556
02:26:40,781 --> 02:26:42,970
They created the indian cards.
It's just as bad.

3557
02:26:43,090 --> 02:26:43,840
No,
it's fine.

3558
02:26:45,570 --> 02:26:48,700
There's a giveaway of the cultural 
frosted flakes.

3559
02:26:48,701 --> 02:26:50,120
Go down a frosted flakes over there.

3560
02:26:53,210 --> 02:26:55,420
yeah.
Nineteen 50 years of vitamin d.

3561
02:26:56,130 --> 02:26:57,040
Vitamin d?
Yeah.

3562
02:26:57,100 --> 02:26:58,850
Throw it in there.
There's no natural losses.

3563
02:26:59,010 --> 02:27:00,460
Millionaire.
He's got milk.

3564
02:27:00,730 --> 02:27:02,920
Posey.
Kid's going to get sick fRom sugar.

3565
02:27:02,921 --> 02:27:04,900
What kind of fucking shitty kids are you
raising?

3566
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:06,670
Reese's puffs cereal.
That was a big one.

3567
02:27:06,671 --> 02:27:08,190
Everyone else.
Reese's puffs.

3568
02:27:08,191 --> 02:27:09,980
Reese's pieces.
Peanut butter cups of cereal.

3569
02:27:10,230 --> 02:27:11,140
You know?
That's it.

3570
02:27:11,160 --> 02:27:12,340
You never had that?
No.

3571
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:17,400
That was a little later than you.
I guess you might have been illegal in 

3572
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:19,621
my country.
They find been looking out for our best 

3573
02:27:19,621 --> 02:27:19,621
interest by the.
I remember it because there was.

3574
02:27:19,621 --> 02:27:21,580
There was like a fat black kid from 
hanging with Mr.

3575
02:27:21,580 --> 02:27:25,440
Cooper who did the commercials and 
Canada for reasons I love that.

3576
02:27:25,450 --> 02:27:30,450
Reese's puffs cereal who were sitting 
there as this kid who was in hanging 

3577
02:27:30,450 --> 02:27:30,450
with Mr.
Cooper and so as a kid you're like,

3578
02:27:30,450 --> 02:27:31,360
well,
we watched that show on t gif.

3579
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,250
We have to get reese's peanut butter 
cups.

3580
02:27:33,251 --> 02:27:35,080
Siri gif up there.
That was what?

3581
02:27:35,081 --> 02:27:36,190
That was the same thing.
Abc,

3582
02:27:36,191 --> 02:27:41,191
you know,
it's a fucking place itself was bad 

3583
02:27:41,801 --> 02:27:43,240
wIngs too.
They're not that bad.

3584
02:27:43,360 --> 02:27:45,580
They're pretty bad in Kansas.
You're on the road.

3585
02:27:46,060 --> 02:27:48,160
It's true.
Tgi friday's,

3586
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:53,400
what's the big deal?
Bennigan's is coming back to bennigan's 

3587
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:53,530
is back.
Don't remember that.

3588
02:27:53,531 --> 02:27:54,490
They were gone away because there was 
like,

3589
02:27:54,491 --> 02:27:55,030
well,
okay,

3590
02:27:55,031 --> 02:27:57,340
bennigan's we can do without.
Didn't notice.

3591
02:27:57,430 --> 02:27:59,230
I mean they went under and then they 
came back.

3592
02:27:59,500 --> 02:28:00,610
They were gone.
Now they're back.

3593
02:28:00,670 --> 02:28:01,660
I don't know why.
Huh?

3594
02:28:01,780 --> 02:28:03,550
Whole new brand.
Probably investment bankers.

3595
02:28:03,551 --> 02:28:06,840
Probably some dudes from marin county.
It's the globalists wire.

3596
02:28:07,260 --> 02:28:09,570
Wire frame.
Glasses was fucks.

3597
02:28:09,700 --> 02:28:14,700
Skinny Jeans will return to do is bring 
back a really recognizable brand.

3598
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:18,090
It's really important to America.
have you ever had people do that on this

3599
02:28:18,091 --> 02:28:20,350
show feel and we understand you.

3600
02:28:20,530 --> 02:28:22,220
People try to in and be like,
listen,

3601
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:27,460
we can take your show even bigger.
We just think there are a few tweaks 

3602
02:28:27,460 --> 02:28:28,130
here.
We got those people who approach,

3603
02:28:28,131 --> 02:28:30,440
you know,
which is interesting.

3604
02:28:31,430 --> 02:28:34,460
Now everybody's like,
no,

3605
02:28:34,600 --> 02:28:35,420
no,
no.

3606
02:28:35,570 --> 02:28:36,790
Adam curl.
they got him though.

3607
02:28:37,220 --> 02:28:38,170
They did.
I don't know,

3608
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:41,660
I did,
I did his show once and it was a,

3609
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:43,580
it was the most awkward thing I'd ever 
done in my life.

3610
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:44,890
Why was it so awkward?
What?

3611
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:47,000
Cause the booker,
so was doing prager university.

3612
02:28:47,001 --> 02:28:47,480
He's like,
oh hey,

3613
02:28:47,481 --> 02:28:49,220
I know I'll hook you up.
And um,

3614
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:50,940
first off he's like,
adam carolla,

3615
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:52,210
he's not like you,
like,

3616
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:54,200
like come in and you talk off air.
You kind of like doesn't,

3617
02:28:54,330 --> 02:28:56,270
it doesn't really talk to you until 
you're on air,

3618
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:58,160
which I can respect.
It's professional,

3619
02:28:58,161 --> 02:29:00,440
but it wasn't on the adam carolla 
podcast.

3620
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:03,890
It was adam carolla and dr drew had 
reunited to do,

3621
02:29:03,900 --> 02:29:05,150
like,
it wasn't a love line,

3622
02:29:05,151 --> 02:29:06,230
but it's effectively the same thing.

3623
02:29:06,410 --> 02:29:11,410
Right.
And so they still do that or they 

3624
02:29:11,410 --> 02:29:11,660
brought it back and it was there for 
like the first week I was there for like

3625
02:29:11,661 --> 02:29:16,661
the first week they brought it back and 
so it's him and dr drew sitting there 

3626
02:29:16,661 --> 02:29:19,841
doing their stick at a table and then 
I'm literally at the end of the table 

3627
02:29:19,841 --> 02:29:21,410
with nothing to say like,
oh yeah,

3628
02:29:21,411 --> 02:29:26,411
that sounds about right.
They're taking calls from people didn't 

3629
02:29:26,411 --> 02:29:26,600
even bring you in a little bit,
but it just,

3630
02:29:26,630 --> 02:29:28,580
you know,
adam carolla does his podcasts,

3631
02:29:28,581 --> 02:29:30,320
like this was an interview and that was 
just,

3632
02:29:30,321 --> 02:29:35,321
it was really weird and I think what 
happened was they didn't realize he 

3633
02:29:35,321 --> 02:29:35,321
wasn't doing the show that day and they 
brought me.

3634
02:29:35,321 --> 02:29:37,760
They were very nice.
Dr drew and adam was gracious afterward,

3635
02:29:37,761 --> 02:29:42,761
but it was,
it was clear like it's a two guy show 

3636
02:29:42,761 --> 02:29:42,761
taking phone calls and you were just 
there.

3637
02:29:42,761 --> 02:29:43,380
Yeah,
it was pretty much just.

3638
02:29:43,650 --> 02:29:45,100
They say your name.
No,

3639
02:29:45,101 --> 02:29:45,770
no,
they did.

3640
02:29:45,950 --> 02:29:46,910
They did,
but it was like,

3641
02:29:48,500 --> 02:29:49,610
we want to take phone calls.
Well,

3642
02:29:49,620 --> 02:29:53,480
adam does essentially doesn't internet 
radio show.

3643
02:29:53,660 --> 02:29:55,310
That's what his show is,
you know?

3644
02:29:55,311 --> 02:29:58,400
I mean he was,
he had his radio show that was a big hit

3645
02:29:58,401 --> 02:30:03,401
radio show and then the station went 
under an la and I think he just decided 

3646
02:30:03,401 --> 02:30:06,080
to do the same format and just do that 
same format online.

3647
02:30:06,110 --> 02:30:07,270
Yeah.
That makes it.

3648
02:30:07,271 --> 02:30:12,271
Well,
when we started our show it was 

3649
02:30:12,271 --> 02:30:12,271
syndicated and so we had radio and so we
had all these commercial breaks.

3650
02:30:12,271 --> 02:30:15,980
When you do at 6:00
AM on friday mornings out of detroit and

3651
02:30:16,050 --> 02:30:21,050
what we do well,
no one really cares about these 

3652
02:30:21,050 --> 02:30:22,721
commercial breaks nationally,
so we just did a bunch of sketches and 

3653
02:30:22,721 --> 02:30:25,421
fake commercials and that's what created
all these characters that people have 

3654
02:30:25,421 --> 02:30:25,640
treated these twitter profiles for 
because we just said,

3655
02:30:25,641 --> 02:30:25,960
well,
you know,

3656
02:30:25,961 --> 02:30:28,340
so we're not going to run an ad for a 
local car dealership.

3657
02:30:28,500 --> 02:30:33,500
Right.
We'll do a fake news break and we would 

3658
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:33,500
do like fake tornado warnings and stuff 
like that,

3659
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:36,230
which is highly illegal by the way.
We learned that one later on,

3660
02:30:36,850 --> 02:30:41,850
uh,
because we had to kind of work with the 

3661
02:30:41,850 --> 02:30:41,850
format online and now we just took it 
off,

3662
02:30:41,850 --> 02:30:42,640
took it off radio.
Fuck radio.

3663
02:30:42,641 --> 02:30:46,430
It was too much dying market.
That thing is not going to last.

3664
02:30:46,431 --> 02:30:51,431
It's stupid.
It was the last time you turned on your 

3665
02:30:51,431 --> 02:30:51,431
radio.
I haven't ever.

3666
02:30:51,431 --> 02:30:52,820
Yeah.
Remember as another person,

3667
02:30:52,970 --> 02:30:57,970
I think like all the cells in your body 
except your neuron switch every seven 

3668
02:30:57,970 --> 02:31:01,751
years.
That means every cell in my body has 

3669
02:31:01,751 --> 02:31:01,751
never listened to the radio.

3670
02:31:01,751 --> 02:31:04,130
That's real.
That's fucking real man.

3671
02:31:04,370 --> 02:31:09,370
It's like if someone said to me when was
the last time you watched a vhs 

3672
02:31:09,370 --> 02:31:09,470
cassette?
As it was another person?

3673
02:31:09,810 --> 02:31:12,770
I wasn't even me.
I don't take responsibility for me of 14

3674
02:31:12,771 --> 02:31:16,580
years ago because if I did I would still
be pissed at shit in my pants when I was

3675
02:31:16,581 --> 02:31:17,570
a baby.
Okay.

3676
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:22,720
Because that would take it back to when 
I was three and I even bit my sister or 

3677
02:31:22,720 --> 02:31:22,720
something.
I don't know what the fuck I did,

3678
02:31:22,720 --> 02:31:24,420
but you know what I mean.
I met,

3679
02:31:24,421 --> 02:31:25,380
I might've,
I don't know.

3680
02:31:25,381 --> 02:31:26,940
I don't remember.
Three is my point.

3681
02:31:26,941 --> 02:31:31,941
It's like if you go back to the things 
you did when you were developing 

3682
02:31:31,941 --> 02:31:31,941
individual.
Yeah.

3683
02:31:31,941 --> 02:31:33,260
So I feel like every seven years I 
don't,

3684
02:31:33,290 --> 02:31:36,180
I don't even want.
I don't even want to know what I did.

3685
02:31:36,181 --> 02:31:37,290
Fourteen years at three.

3686
02:31:37,290 --> 02:31:42,290
It's pretty rough years.
I called my dad's pastor a little 

3687
02:31:42,290 --> 02:31:42,290
bastard.
Three.

3688
02:31:42,290 --> 02:31:45,870
You should probably write well because 
my grandfather called me a little 

3689
02:31:45,870 --> 02:31:48,321
bastard and I thought it was a term of 
endearment and somebody has like this 

3690
02:31:48,321 --> 02:31:48,321
test or kevin butcher.
I said,

3691
02:31:48,321 --> 02:31:48,321
hey,
how you doing?

3692
02:31:48,321 --> 02:31:51,570
Little bastard weld that pastors should 
have known,

3693
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:53,850
oh,
this kid is getting fucked over at home.

3694
02:31:54,060 --> 02:31:54,900
No,
you know what happened?

3695
02:31:54,901 --> 02:31:56,030
Actually,
he got outed.

3696
02:31:56,140 --> 02:31:57,550
Uh,
and this is actually a point where,

3697
02:31:57,900 --> 02:31:58,170
no,
no,

3698
02:31:58,171 --> 02:32:03,171
no,
he got it from the church because there 

3699
02:32:03,171 --> 02:32:03,171
was his pregnant,
I think his pregnant wife bomb,

3700
02:32:03,171 --> 02:32:06,741
which wasn't a detroit lions game.
And there was a guy with a bull horn 

3701
02:32:06,741 --> 02:32:07,500
behind her,
right up against her ear.

3702
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:08,630
Right?
This guy was a pat,

3703
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:10,160
but a really good guy,
uh,

3704
02:32:10,470 --> 02:32:11,610
regardless of someone's,
you know,

3705
02:32:11,611 --> 02:32:12,930
religious affiliation,
but a good guy.

3706
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:14,640
And he's like,
hey man,

3707
02:32:14,641 --> 02:32:15,600
can you stop my wife's here?

3708
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:15,990
You know,
whatever.

3709
02:32:15,991 --> 02:32:20,991
She was pregnant or something and I to 
look at it and kept doing it right next 

3710
02:32:21,211 --> 02:32:21,760
to his wife's here,
like,

3711
02:32:21,770 --> 02:32:23,750
got right up on her ear.
And he,

3712
02:32:23,751 --> 02:32:25,500
he,
he ended up kicking the guY's ass,

3713
02:32:25,650 --> 02:32:30,650
uh,
getting into a fight with him because 

3714
02:32:30,650 --> 02:32:32,061
the guy was getting up on their space 
and it didn't exactly turn the other 

3715
02:32:32,061 --> 02:32:32,061
cheek.
He did not.

3716
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:34,410
He did when he asked them to.
And so there was a whole vote.

3717
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:35,630
And uh,
I remember that was,

3718
02:32:35,660 --> 02:32:36,900
that was when I was pretty young.
I thought,

3719
02:32:36,901 --> 02:32:38,190
well,
so they outed him.

3720
02:32:38,191 --> 02:32:40,260
They got rid of them,
meaning I could be wrong.

3721
02:32:40,290 --> 02:32:43,200
There was a hole up,
there was a whole controversy over it.

3722
02:32:43,201 --> 02:32:44,940
And I remember learning about it as a 
kid thing.

3723
02:32:44,941 --> 02:32:46,230
Well that's,
that seems pretty reasonable.

3724
02:32:46,231 --> 02:32:49,260
The guy getting up and his wife's grill 
and bothering a pregnant woman.

3725
02:32:49,700 --> 02:32:50,940
It's like,
what do you do?

3726
02:32:50,970 --> 02:32:53,340
Because human nature is definitely the 
hit the person.

3727
02:32:53,940 --> 02:32:55,550
But do you just leave,
you know,

3728
02:32:55,740 --> 02:32:56,380
because you're,
you're,

3729
02:32:56,460 --> 02:32:57,780
your nIght is ruined.
Yeah.

3730
02:32:57,870 --> 02:32:58,650
Period.
Well,

3731
02:32:58,651 --> 02:32:59,640
I say kick his ass.
I mean,

3732
02:32:59,641 --> 02:33:00,690
I think what happened was.
No,

3733
02:33:00,700 --> 02:33:01,650
no,
I don't think he kicked his ass,

3734
02:33:01,651 --> 02:33:04,410
I'm saying,
but you got physical and he got physical

3735
02:33:04,411 --> 02:33:07,290
with a guy and got the better of them.
So it could have been a shoving match.

3736
02:33:07,291 --> 02:33:09,420
Could have been a punch.
He didn't beat him.

3737
02:33:09,421 --> 02:33:10,500
It wasn't american history.
X,

3738
02:33:10,501 --> 02:33:13,380
curb stomp.
I'm just saying no one expected a pastor

3739
02:33:13,381 --> 02:33:15,420
to do anything to protect his wife 
again.

3740
02:33:15,620 --> 02:33:16,580
Yeah.
And uh,

3741
02:33:17,010 --> 02:33:19,320
that was a big deal.
I called him little bastard.

3742
02:33:20,070 --> 02:33:22,080
That's the end of that rabbit trail.
While you were right,

3743
02:33:22,380 --> 02:33:24,750
once you got kicked out that crowd or 
kid,

3744
02:33:25,110 --> 02:33:27,270
he's got vision.
He sees the future.

3745
02:33:27,780 --> 02:33:30,840
This kid's going places.
He knew that guy was a brawler.

3746
02:33:31,230 --> 02:33:34,440
He's in fucking bleachers.
Brawler tag.

3747
02:33:34,490 --> 02:33:36,630
It's look it up.
Fucks his wife,

3748
02:33:36,631 --> 02:33:38,700
gets her pregnant texture to the game.

3749
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:42,420
That crowd has gone places.
He calls It.

3750
02:33:42,570 --> 02:33:44,430
He's going to go to fox news for four 
years.

3751
02:33:44,490 --> 02:33:49,490
He knows four years of his life.
I saw him on this show once with amy 

3752
02:33:49,490 --> 02:33:49,920
schumer.
He acted with a.

3753
02:33:50,540 --> 02:33:52,590
Oh,
I took his side.

3754
02:33:53,130 --> 02:33:55,390
He good with it.
What is this?

3755
02:33:55,950 --> 02:33:57,060
What did she do?
She,

3756
02:33:57,061 --> 02:34:02,061
you guys were on some show and she was 
trying to like diminish you as a 

3757
02:34:02,061 --> 02:34:02,061
comedian.
Yeah,

3758
02:34:02,061 --> 02:34:02,061
it was.
She,

3759
02:34:02,061 --> 02:34:03,230
she was trying to say you weren't a 
comedian.

3760
02:34:03,231 --> 02:34:04,980
Yeah.
And then the interesting thing,

3761
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:08,340
this is like a thing that people do in 
the world of standup comedy with it.

3762
02:34:08,341 --> 02:34:08,730
Just say,
oh,

3763
02:34:08,740 --> 02:34:10,650
he's an opener.
Like he's a middle act.

3764
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:11,400
Right.
you know,

3765
02:34:11,410 --> 02:34:16,410
like the,
there's like there's this weird sort of 

3766
02:34:16,410 --> 02:34:16,410
a thing and someone like if they're 
looking like shit on you.

3767
02:34:16,410 --> 02:34:16,970
Oh,
you do ta,

3768
02:34:17,020 --> 02:34:19,030
you do comedy,
you do comedy.

3769
02:34:19,030 --> 02:34:19,660
Yeah.
What he'd done,

3770
02:34:19,930 --> 02:34:22,390
he'd do a few open mics.
You think you're a fucking comedian?

3771
02:34:22,450 --> 02:34:23,710
Yeah,
I really.

3772
02:34:24,190 --> 02:34:24,960
It's very,
very,

3773
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:26,400
really disliked that.
Yeah,

3774
02:34:26,440 --> 02:34:31,440
she did that right off and I knew it 
because she was asking me questions in 

3775
02:34:31,440 --> 02:34:31,440
the green room.
Like,

3776
02:34:31,440 --> 02:34:31,750
where do you,
where do you do comedy?

3777
02:34:31,900 --> 02:34:32,550
What do you do?
Do you.

3778
02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:33,730
And she was like,
she asked me one point,

3779
02:34:33,760 --> 02:34:35,350
did you perform at churches?
I said,

3780
02:34:35,590 --> 02:34:36,940
no.
I said,

3781
02:34:36,941 --> 02:34:37,600
no,
I never have.

3782
02:34:37,610 --> 02:34:40,420
And she.
But she was so inflexible and argument.

3783
02:34:40,421 --> 02:34:44,010
She was an old maybe 22,
23.

3784
02:34:44,050 --> 02:34:45,970
I would have shit on you too dude.
Probably what?

3785
02:34:45,971 --> 02:34:48,040
I would have been right next to it that 
changed.

3786
02:34:48,070 --> 02:34:51,950
If you look at the rehab,
amy would have fucking dog tag deal.

3787
02:34:53,340 --> 02:34:53,970
No,
I don't.

3788
02:34:53,971 --> 02:34:56,160
I don't think so.
It changed drowsing sound.

3789
02:34:56,500 --> 02:34:57,340
What do you think would have happened?

3790
02:34:57,340 --> 02:35:01,420
You would have won that.
Been there and done really well?

3791
02:35:01,480 --> 02:35:02,470
Yeah.
Yeah,

3792
02:35:02,730 --> 02:35:03,970
I think,
I think if you watched that thing,

3793
02:35:03,971 --> 02:35:05,350
her argument was you're not a real 
comedian.

3794
02:35:05,351 --> 02:35:08,650
I think I would have never accessed 
information and shimmers of 30 something

3795
02:35:08,651 --> 02:35:13,651
year old girl who bitches and people on 
twitter now and is unmarried and 

3796
02:35:13,651 --> 02:35:13,651
miserable and I'm married to a woman.
Uh,

3797
02:35:13,651 --> 02:35:16,030
I'm pretty happy With.
Are you comparing lives?

3798
02:35:16,570 --> 02:35:18,670
Um,
I am and I think I was right.

3799
02:35:18,790 --> 02:35:21,910
Well I think that whenever someone and 
also that she's funny by the way.

3800
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:23,590
Okay,
good for you.

3801
02:35:24,100 --> 02:35:27,700
I think whenever someone says that 
you're not a comedian thing,

3802
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:28,840
that's,
that's an issue.

3803
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:33,960
I have an issue with that because we all
started out as an open micros and when 

3804
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:37,490
you're talking to someone who's 22 years
old when I was 22 hours and open miker I

3805
02:35:37,590 --> 02:35:40,210
was doing open mic nights just for 
laughs at that point.

3806
02:35:40,210 --> 02:35:41,320
So it wasn't an open mic or.
Yeah,

3807
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:42,270
I mean,
and you know,

3808
02:35:42,290 --> 02:35:43,650
I'd will,
you be clunky.

3809
02:35:43,690 --> 02:35:48,690
Well,
you're getting paid professional 

3810
02:35:48,690 --> 02:35:48,690
comedian.
You're making your living off of standup

3811
02:35:48,690 --> 02:35:52,590
comedy or reading only made my living 
ever off of acting standup comedy or 

3812
02:35:52,590 --> 02:35:52,840
writing since 18 years old.
Wow.

3813
02:35:52,841 --> 02:35:57,841
So when you were 22 years old,
all your bills when you lived with your 

3814
02:35:57,841 --> 02:35:58,480
mom or what's going on now?
How are you paying your bills?

3815
02:35:58,481 --> 02:35:59,880
A standup comedy?
We're 22 years,

3816
02:35:59,910 --> 02:36:01,060
so I was,
I was uh,

3817
02:36:01,061 --> 02:36:06,061
I would do stand up and they had some 
pretty relatively successful acting 

3818
02:36:06,061 --> 02:36:06,061
gigs.
Did some films,

3819
02:36:06,061 --> 02:36:08,860
commercials on tv.
I'm at that point.

3820
02:36:08,861 --> 02:36:10,960
I was a fox news contributor which paid 
me retainer.

3821
02:36:11,260 --> 02:36:12,760
Um,
I did freelance writing where they would

3822
02:36:12,761 --> 02:36:17,761
pay by the word.
So those you were doing standup on a 

3823
02:36:17,761 --> 02:36:17,970
regular basis.
See where a standup guy.

3824
02:36:17,970 --> 02:36:22,970
I don't do it much anymore.
I would readily admit now I don't 

3825
02:36:22,970 --> 02:36:25,681
because the show and everything is a 14 
hour day and I would never claim to be 

3826
02:36:25,681 --> 02:36:29,011
as good of a standup as,
as you are nick depaulo or a builder by 

3827
02:36:29,011 --> 02:36:29,011
the way.
But nick depAulo asked me to plug.

3828
02:36:29,011 --> 02:36:30,460
He's doing a standup special in boston.
Yeah.

3829
02:36:30,461 --> 02:36:33,370
His standup specials going on seeso this
thursday.

3830
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:36,670
So please go.
He's tomorrow the best for my money,

3831
02:36:36,671 --> 02:36:38,510
one of the best living comedians.
Uh,

3832
02:36:38,610 --> 02:36:43,610
he's certainly one of my favorite.
Nick depaulo was goddamn hilarious and 

3833
02:36:43,610 --> 02:36:44,380
he was here yesterday and you fucking 
killed me.

3834
02:36:44,440 --> 02:36:44,960
he's,
he's,

3835
02:36:45,100 --> 02:36:46,990
he's a very fun and a very,
very,

3836
02:36:46,991 --> 02:36:49,120
very good dude.
And another weirdo,

3837
02:36:49,121 --> 02:36:50,470
right wing.
Fuck yeah,

3838
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:52,140
he is.
But um,

3839
02:36:52,350 --> 02:36:53,080
you know,
it's pretty common.

3840
02:36:53,081 --> 02:36:54,430
I mean,
christopher titus at the same thing.

3841
02:36:54,431 --> 02:36:55,030
That was the same thing.

3842
02:36:55,030 --> 02:36:56,130
We staRted losing the gun issue.
He goes,

3843
02:36:56,131 --> 02:36:57,550
well on stand up.
I get paid for standing.

3844
02:36:58,010 --> 02:36:58,920
Well,
you know,

3845
02:36:59,110 --> 02:37:04,110
that's he when he was doing was trying 
to save whatever was going on in his 

3846
02:37:04,110 --> 02:37:07,390
mind when there's a conversation,
whether it was a competition,

3847
02:37:07,690 --> 02:37:12,690
whatever,
the little battle ground and his mind 

3848
02:37:12,690 --> 02:37:12,690
was going on.
He was trying to save his,

3849
02:37:12,690 --> 02:37:13,470
his patch of land.
Well,

3850
02:37:13,570 --> 02:37:18,570
I think,
and I think it would work with most 

3851
02:37:18,570 --> 02:37:18,570
people,
I think you would probably go with,

3852
02:37:18,570 --> 02:37:18,570
there's a lot of standup comedians.
They,

3853
02:37:18,570 --> 02:37:21,080
they have a void and they're filling it.
This becomes their identity.

3854
02:37:21,470 --> 02:37:24,500
And so for me it was never my whole 
identity wrapped up in standup.

3855
02:37:24,530 --> 02:37:29,530
I mean,
I had been doing acting since I was 12 

3856
02:37:29,530 --> 02:37:29,530
years old and I was tutored on set with 
a lot of things.

3857
02:37:29,530 --> 02:37:29,530
Uh,
you know,

3858
02:37:29,530 --> 02:37:32,180
I did kid's cartoons that show arthur's 
how I started out,

3859
02:37:32,420 --> 02:37:37,420
so I did stand up and I'll be the first 
minute I did it as a means to getting to

3860
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:39,950
other avenues and then it turned out I 
fell in love with it,

3861
02:37:39,951 --> 02:37:41,570
but I never planned on doing stand up my
whole life.

3862
02:37:41,990 --> 02:37:43,610
So if I were,
I'm a standup comedian,

3863
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:45,050
I'm a road comic.
I love being,

3864
02:37:45,051 --> 02:37:50,051
you know,
waking up for leftover drugs and being 

3865
02:37:50,051 --> 02:37:50,051
unhappy and bitching about my manager 
leftover drugs.

3866
02:37:50,051 --> 02:37:51,650
Have you ever heard of such thing?
YeAh,

3867
02:37:51,860 --> 02:37:52,320
yeah.
I'm,

3868
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:56,960
I've got leftover Turkey.
Oh,

3869
02:37:56,961 --> 02:37:58,290
drugs,
drugs.

3870
02:37:58,320 --> 02:38:02,240
This will have them write the pride in 
standup of barely getting by,

3871
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:03,800
kind of like New York.
Right?

3872
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:08,510
You're in a shitty city in a two bedroom
apartment with five roommates and you're

3873
02:38:08,511 --> 02:38:10,850
proud of it because you can tell 
everyone how miserable you are.

3874
02:38:11,750 --> 02:38:14,060
So it just didn't work out real.
Oh yeah,

3875
02:38:14,061 --> 02:38:14,810
no,
no.

3876
02:38:14,811 --> 02:38:17,000
It's real.
Once you become successful,

3877
02:38:17,240 --> 02:38:19,130
it's never real.
While it's struggling,

3878
02:38:19,160 --> 02:38:20,990
people try to act like it is right,
like all man,

3879
02:38:20,991 --> 02:38:22,790
I couldn't do anywhere else.
It's the energy of this city.

3880
02:38:22,791 --> 02:38:26,120
It's like you literally see you shit in 
a drain in the kitchen,

3881
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:28,080
you know,
and those in the lower east side,

3882
02:38:28,090 --> 02:38:30,980
you're the lower east side.
It's so saturated.

3883
02:38:31,010 --> 02:38:36,010
I have not right wing.
people are always exaggerating.

3884
02:38:36,410 --> 02:38:41,410
I looked at it in the east village 
because he'd have like 19 polish family 

3885
02:38:41,410 --> 02:38:45,371
members per apartment and the toilet was
right in the middle of the kitchen 

3886
02:38:45,371 --> 02:38:47,420
because they weren't designed.
Sometimes you have to dig a shit bacon.

3887
02:38:50,830 --> 02:38:53,090
Same tIme.
It's an extra toilet.

3888
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:55,730
There's one for mom.
While she's making spaghetti,

3889
02:38:55,790 --> 02:38:57,560
they're multitasking.
She could squat,

3890
02:38:58,160 --> 02:39:03,160
squat,
one of those little squatty potty 

3891
02:39:03,160 --> 02:39:03,160
things.
He ever seen that one sign.

3892
02:39:03,160 --> 02:39:05,390
Like if you go to some places frequented
by too many people from asia,

3893
02:39:05,690 --> 02:39:10,690
you'll see signs that show like a person
standing on the shitter squatting down.

3894
02:39:11,751 --> 02:39:14,240
It's got a red line through it.
don't shit.

3895
02:39:15,010 --> 02:39:16,120
yes.
Pull.

3896
02:39:16,450 --> 02:39:18,270
Has it become that popular?
The squatty potty.

3897
02:39:18,271 --> 02:39:21,080
but I've seen it.
I've seen here's the squatty potty.

3898
02:39:21,081 --> 02:39:22,490
Yes I do.
And home I would assume.

3899
02:39:22,491 --> 02:39:25,820
So it helps the caveman thing,
the bowel movement.

3900
02:39:26,090 --> 02:39:28,520
Well if I prefer to shit in a hole in 
the ground.

3901
02:39:29,050 --> 02:39:32,780
So the kitchen has the time to dig.
Like look at the guy.

3902
02:39:33,480 --> 02:39:33,850
No,
no,

3903
02:39:33,890 --> 02:39:37,370
no it right.
That would just one.

3904
02:39:37,490 --> 02:39:42,490
This is a joke one,
but I have literally seen that that's 

3905
02:39:42,490 --> 02:39:42,490
real.

3906
02:39:42,490 --> 02:39:44,750
That is an actual real for people in 
asia.

3907
02:39:45,330 --> 02:39:50,330
Arusha fear went to China and he has 
this fucking hilarious bit about it and 

3908
02:39:50,330 --> 02:39:51,860
I don't want to.
I don't want to do his bit.

3909
02:39:52,020 --> 02:39:53,180
That's,
that's real.

3910
02:39:53,390 --> 02:39:57,680
But in China he went into a restroom and
there was literally a hole in the ground

3911
02:39:57,830 --> 02:40:00,980
and you were supposed to squat over the 
hole and they had no toilet paper.

3912
02:40:01,010 --> 02:40:02,150
Yeah.
That is real.

3913
02:40:02,390 --> 02:40:06,890
And he told me that when people from 
asia who are used to that environment as

3914
02:40:06,891 --> 02:40:11,891
the norm come over to the United States,
sometimes they actually stand on the 

3915
02:40:11,891 --> 02:40:13,860
toilet seat and,
and shit that way.

3916
02:40:14,310 --> 02:40:17,160
So the toilet seat is not designed for 
the ame to be accurate.

3917
02:40:17,161 --> 02:40:19,140
If you're.
If you're sitting on the toilet seat,

3918
02:40:19,141 --> 02:40:24,141
you'd be crapping on the water tank.
They don't know any better either from 

3919
02:40:24,141 --> 02:40:25,530
another country without trump,
without trump leading them.

3920
02:40:25,770 --> 02:40:27,980
They don't even know anything man.
What happens?

3921
02:40:28,280 --> 02:40:29,520
Tossing,
defending trump,

3922
02:40:29,550 --> 02:40:30,070
I think,
uh,

3923
02:40:30,140 --> 02:40:31,120
you know,
do,

3924
02:40:31,210 --> 02:40:34,680
do you think he's a good leader?
Are you happy that he's an office?

3925
02:40:34,700 --> 02:40:37,080
Are you,
is it good because it's a shakeup.

3926
02:40:37,260 --> 02:40:38,790
I will say this.
Um,

3927
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:40,070
I,
I,

3928
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:42,840
I think that again,
the left has behaved so poorly.

3929
02:40:43,430 --> 02:40:43,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

3930
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:45,840
I think that trump,
Donald Trump has been a lightning rod.

3931
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:48,840
I would disagree with him on some policy
issues for sure,

3932
02:40:49,140 --> 02:40:54,140
but I think that because everyone has 
called him a nazi and a racist and 

3933
02:40:54,140 --> 02:40:56,870
sexist and a transfer job that it's 
removed those arguments from the table 

3934
02:40:56,870 --> 02:40:56,870
for,
for,

3935
02:40:56,870 --> 02:41:01,670
for,
for at least several decades because 

3936
02:41:01,670 --> 02:41:01,670
people are going.

3937
02:41:01,670 --> 02:41:03,830
Yeah,
but you saId it about john mccain and 

3938
02:41:03,830 --> 02:41:03,830
mitt romney.
Everyone you disagree with is a racist.

3939
02:41:03,830 --> 02:41:08,031
I think that card has been played too 
much and because of Donald Trump has 

3940
02:41:08,031 --> 02:41:09,330
been overplayed and I think now we see 
with our channel,

3941
02:41:09,560 --> 02:41:10,710
um,
granted it's not as big as,

3942
02:41:10,711 --> 02:41:12,060
you know,
the outreach you guys have,

3943
02:41:12,061 --> 02:41:17,061
but it's grown pretty substantially and 
a lot of our audience are self 

3944
02:41:17,061 --> 02:41:17,061
professed.
Liberals going,

3945
02:41:17,061 --> 02:41:18,300
you know what?
I used to hate you.

3946
02:41:18,330 --> 02:41:20,140
I used to,
I used to watch the young turks and that

3947
02:41:20,170 --> 02:41:25,170
we used to watch some crap on you,
but actually some of these points make 

3948
02:41:25,170 --> 02:41:28,341
sense.
And I used to think everyone will 

3949
02:41:28,341 --> 02:41:28,341
disagree with me with racist.
And I think because it's so overplaYed,

3950
02:41:28,341 --> 02:41:29,280
it's left such a bad taste in people's 
mouth.

3951
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:33,810
I do think that Donald Trump has served 
a real purpose to shine a light on that.

3952
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:38,900
And you know,
that may be the most important point of 

3953
02:41:38,900 --> 02:41:39,300
all at this point in our culture.
What's political correctness?

3954
02:41:39,660 --> 02:41:44,660
I think when things go too far,
one way people get upset with that and 

3955
02:41:44,660 --> 02:41:46,650
when people get too bias,
whether it's towards the left or towards

3956
02:41:46,651 --> 02:41:51,651
the right,
it tends to balance things out in the 

3957
02:41:51,651 --> 02:41:53,791
other direction.
Like robert anton wilson called lyndon 

3958
02:41:53,791 --> 02:41:54,210
johnson,
the pacifist president,

3959
02:41:54,450 --> 02:41:59,450
you know why he called them the pacifist
president because he was such a cunt 

3960
02:41:59,450 --> 02:42:04,280
that he created so many pacifists 
because if his atrocities that he 

3961
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:08,301
ordered in the Vietnam war,
people were so upset that more people 

3962
02:42:08,301 --> 02:42:10,380
became pacifist during the lincoln,
or excuse me,

3963
02:42:10,381 --> 02:42:13,710
they're in during the lyndon johnson 
administration than than ever before.

3964
02:42:14,190 --> 02:42:16,740
By the same token,
he called reagan,

3965
02:42:16,890 --> 02:42:20,430
the intellectual president because more 
people just went,

3966
02:42:20,431 --> 02:42:21,260
oh my god,
you gotta.

3967
02:42:21,270 --> 02:42:22,710
Fuck god dammit.

3968
02:42:22,740 --> 02:42:24,540
It's important to know things.
yeah,

3969
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:26,280
god damn it.
It's important to be smart.

3970
02:42:26,281 --> 02:42:28,170
Like just say,
no bitch.

3971
02:42:28,320 --> 02:42:30,600
What are you talking about?
Just saying no,

3972
02:42:30,740 --> 02:42:35,740
you're.
You're bringing heroin and from just say

3973
02:42:35,771 --> 02:42:40,771
no.
You're selling coke in south central to 

3974
02:42:40,771 --> 02:42:42,160
pay for the fucking consciously.
This is reagan was selling coke.

3975
02:42:42,940 --> 02:42:45,480
All of you don't know the oliver north 
story.

3976
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:48,370
Oh,
oliver north ross.

3977
02:42:48,530 --> 02:42:50,910
You know the whole story from real rick 
ross.

3978
02:42:50,911 --> 02:42:53,010
Dude,
the real rick ross.

3979
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:58,340
Not the wrapper,
but the real rick ross has been on my 

3980
02:42:58,340 --> 02:43:00,891
podcast twice,
was a drug dealer in south central who 

3981
02:43:00,891 --> 02:43:02,280
they put away for life due to the three 
strikes rule,

3982
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:04,110
but became,
didn't know how to read.

3983
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:05,490
Okay.
Went to jail,

3984
02:43:05,610 --> 02:43:08,670
was a drug dealer,
made millions of dollars selling coke.

3985
02:43:08,671 --> 02:43:13,671
Okay.
Did not have any idea who was bringing 

3986
02:43:13,671 --> 02:43:14,230
him to coach kelly was getting at where 
it was coming from.

3987
02:43:14,500 --> 02:43:19,500
The profits that they were making was 
literally paying north oliver north to 

3988
02:43:20,980 --> 02:43:23,350
arm the conscious versus the 
sandinistas.

3989
02:43:23,351 --> 02:43:24,370
I mean,
it was literally,

3990
02:43:24,371 --> 02:43:26,200
it was all proven in court.
I mean,

3991
02:43:26,201 --> 02:43:29,770
this is what my current are contracted 
in front of.

3992
02:43:30,130 --> 02:43:31,360
What was the,
uh,

3993
02:43:31,790 --> 02:43:36,070
I forget what the gathering was,
but on television,

3994
02:43:36,071 --> 02:43:38,260
on cspan,
michael rupert,

3995
02:43:38,290 --> 02:43:43,290
who was a narcotics officer for the los 
angeles police department who has also 

3996
02:43:43,290 --> 02:43:44,890
been on my podcast for committed 
suicide.

3997
02:43:45,130 --> 02:43:48,100
He was the guy that was the focus,
that movie collapse.

3998
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:50,140
Remember that movie collapsed where he's
talking about.

3999
02:43:50,180 --> 02:43:53,410
I'm trying to remember that he,
it was just him smoking cigarettes.

4000
02:43:53,590 --> 02:43:56,860
Sitting there talking about what he knew
about the economy,

4001
02:43:56,861 --> 02:44:01,861
what he knew about all these different 
things that were problematic in our 

4002
02:44:01,861 --> 02:44:02,820
society and how there's only a certain 
amount of time for it,

4003
02:44:02,830 --> 02:44:03,460
it's going to collapse.

4004
02:44:03,460 --> 02:44:06,010
It was kind of crazy doom and gloom 
documentary,

4005
02:44:06,220 --> 02:44:10,180
but the point is he had caught cia 
agents,

4006
02:44:10,181 --> 02:44:15,181
rogue cowboy cia agents in the,
in the middle of selling drugs in south 

4007
02:44:17,501 --> 02:44:22,501
central los angeles reported it and was 
in trouble because of that and decided 

4008
02:44:22,501 --> 02:44:24,790
to go public with it and they were 
selling these drugs.

4009
02:44:24,791 --> 02:44:29,791
They were making shitloads of money and 
they were transferring the money to arm 

4010
02:44:29,791 --> 02:44:29,980
these rebels.
Well,

4011
02:44:30,040 --> 02:44:35,040
rick ross was in the middle of that and 
didn't know he was in the middle of 

4012
02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:38,791
that.
He was literally selling drugs and 

4013
02:44:38,791 --> 02:44:38,791
funneling this whole thing.
Went to,

4014
02:44:38,791 --> 02:44:41,110
went to jail as an illiterate person who
couldn't literally couldn't read,

4015
02:44:41,430 --> 02:44:43,840
learn how to read in jail.
Became a lawyer,

4016
02:44:43,841 --> 02:44:45,370
a jail like,
like learned.

4017
02:44:45,430 --> 02:44:46,150
Oh,
okay.

4018
02:44:46,151 --> 02:44:51,151
Yeah.
I figured out that you can't charge him 

4019
02:44:51,151 --> 02:44:51,550
for the three strikes rule.
If it's one thing,

4020
02:44:51,880 --> 02:44:52,180
if it's.

4021
02:44:52,270 --> 02:44:55,180
If you're charging him with a bunch of 
counts under one incident,

4022
02:44:55,360 --> 02:45:00,360
it's the three strikes.
Law doesn't apply and that's how they 

4023
02:45:00,360 --> 02:45:03,001
got him in jail.
So now he's out like all of this came 

4024
02:45:03,001 --> 02:45:03,001
because of that.
Well,

4025
02:45:03,001 --> 02:45:07,741
I knew about all of the north and in the
contra thing I didn't know about rick 

4026
02:45:07,741 --> 02:45:07,741
ross specifically.
Well,

4027
02:45:07,741 --> 02:45:11,430
this has been proved.
Some elements of our government have 

4028
02:45:11,430 --> 02:45:15,601
sold drugs to improv which neighborhoods
in order to fund black ops,

4029
02:45:15,670 --> 02:45:20,670
like this is a fact,
and this is one of the things that 

4030
02:45:20,670 --> 02:45:23,611
robert anton wilson was talking about 
when he was talking about the reagan 

4031
02:45:23,611 --> 02:45:26,371
administration.
It was like it became the intellectual 

4032
02:45:26,371 --> 02:45:28,891
president because people were so 
frustrated by how fucking crazy and 

4033
02:45:28,891 --> 02:45:30,820
chaotic and movie like,
you know,

4034
02:45:30,970 --> 02:45:34,840
things can become that they had decided 
to arm themselves with information.

4035
02:45:35,440 --> 02:45:40,440
I wonder if a big part of it too is the 
backlash with ronald reagan because 

4036
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:40,440
everyone said again,
he had no chance.

4037
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:43,120
He was a moron and he won in a landslide
or people go,

4038
02:45:43,330 --> 02:45:44,800
all right,
screw you.

4039
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:46,390
We're going to consider them an 
intellectual.

4040
02:45:46,480 --> 02:45:47,470
Like with Donald Trump.
Listen,

4041
02:45:47,471 --> 02:45:52,471
I don't think donald trump's 
intellectual and no one was entering in 

4042
02:45:52,471 --> 02:45:55,370
an intellectual.
They were considering him a great 

4043
02:45:55,370 --> 02:45:55,370
american.
Right?

4044
02:45:55,370 --> 02:45:58,580
He had slicked back hair and his wife 
stood still and everybody was happy in 

4045
02:45:58,580 --> 02:46:00,820
between seances at the white house 
called her astrologer,

4046
02:46:00,821 --> 02:46:05,821
making sure,
but I think people might've just been 

4047
02:46:05,821 --> 02:46:05,920
like,
you know what?

4048
02:46:05,921 --> 02:46:08,860
You called him a moron for so long and 
everyone voted him a moron that.

4049
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:10,970
Well,
they didn't really call reagan a moron.

4050
02:46:10,971 --> 02:46:11,480
Yeah,
they did.

4051
02:46:12,450 --> 02:46:14,590
They called George Bush.
Yeah,

4052
02:46:14,600 --> 02:46:15,260
they did.
Yes,

4053
02:46:15,261 --> 02:46:18,100
I did.
Here's the playbook with,

4054
02:46:18,140 --> 02:46:23,140
with anyone who's conservative,
republican is if they can make you a 

4055
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:23,140
more than they will.
If not,

4056
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:23,210
you're evil,
right?

4057
02:46:23,220 --> 02:46:24,530
dick cheney can't be a moron.

4058
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:27,320
He's evil.
I think you're confusing the narrative a

4059
02:46:27,321 --> 02:46:29,840
little bit because reagan might have 
been simplistic,

4060
02:46:29,841 --> 02:46:34,841
but he was a wonderful speaker like he.
He gave really articulate well thought 

4061
02:46:35,391 --> 02:46:39,500
out speeches that spoke to americans.
Again,

4062
02:46:39,501 --> 02:46:44,501
longing for this nostalgia of a time 
where the norman rockwell painting made 

4063
02:46:44,811 --> 02:46:47,090
sense and that's what ronald reagan 
represents it to.

4064
02:46:47,091 --> 02:46:47,820
A lot of people.
yeah.

4065
02:46:48,140 --> 02:46:49,090
A lot of people,
they were,

4066
02:46:49,160 --> 02:46:51,110
you know,
they were coming out of the chaos of the

4067
02:46:51,111 --> 02:46:55,610
carter administration and the fucking 
Vietnam and lines,

4068
02:46:56,100 --> 02:47:01,100
the gas lines and the iranians taking 
the american hostages and all that crazy

4069
02:47:01,611 --> 02:47:03,510
shit.
And ronald reagan came along.

4070
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:04,520
He was like,
I'm going to fix it.

4071
02:47:04,521 --> 02:47:05,520
I'm your dad.
Never was like,

4072
02:47:05,540 --> 02:47:10,540
we're in.
But the media treated him like a real 

4073
02:47:10,540 --> 02:47:10,540
moron.
If you go back and watch that,

4074
02:47:10,540 --> 02:47:10,910
and then right before his landslide 
election,

4075
02:47:10,911 --> 02:47:12,380
when they may,
if you look at the,

4076
02:47:12,381 --> 02:47:13,370
uh,
the electoral map,

4077
02:47:13,371 --> 02:47:14,960
sort of the poles and the predictive 
predictions,

4078
02:47:14,961 --> 02:47:19,961
they,
they gave him no chance of winning and 

4079
02:47:19,961 --> 02:47:20,630
that's full of shit about Colorado and 
traffic deaths.

4080
02:47:21,470 --> 02:47:23,480
Should we go and fuck you up with this 
too?

4081
02:47:23,790 --> 02:47:27,110
Yeah.
The Colorado thing at all.

4082
02:47:27,260 --> 02:47:28,580
What?
I never said Colorado.

4083
02:47:28,581 --> 02:47:30,830
I said states that legalized.
What other ones are there?

4084
02:47:30,860 --> 02:47:35,860
Well,
you didn't bring up the source that I 

4085
02:47:35,860 --> 02:47:35,860
wrote about.
I can,

4086
02:47:35,860 --> 02:47:35,860
but the fact that you're still hung up 
on police.

4087
02:47:35,860 --> 02:47:35,870
Hopeless.

4088
02:47:36,340 --> 02:47:37,320
Oh,
you got the article.

4089
02:47:37,321 --> 02:47:39,330
I've been looking at it for like last 
few minutes on your website.

4090
02:47:40,620 --> 02:47:45,620
There's a couple of statements that are 
really bad just off to just off the 

4091
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:45,620
gate.
Like this right here.

4092
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:45,640
If you want to get high,
you're a moron.

4093
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:46,070
Hmm.

4094
02:47:46,590 --> 02:47:50,100
Well it's getting high.
That's not a news article.

4095
02:47:50,250 --> 02:47:51,480
Hold on please.
That's commentary.

4096
02:47:51,540 --> 02:47:52,560
Hold on,
but fine.

4097
02:47:52,830 --> 02:47:55,200
After all things like coachella wouldn't
exist.

4098
02:47:55,320 --> 02:47:58,290
Is this your article?
It's an article on my site.

4099
02:47:58,410 --> 02:47:58,890
Oh,
wait a minute.

4100
02:47:58,891 --> 02:48:00,090
If you could want to get high,
you will.

4101
02:48:00,091 --> 02:48:03,180
You're a moron.
Moron.

4102
02:48:03,350 --> 02:48:03,840
I think.
Courtney,

4103
02:48:04,330 --> 02:48:06,930
who is courtney,
she's working on one of the best writers

4104
02:48:07,110 --> 02:48:09,090
I've ever encountered.
Dare you not read them,

4105
02:48:09,110 --> 02:48:10,670
but.
So then the article links.

4106
02:48:10,690 --> 02:48:14,950
So a couple like this for instance,
is when it says it has deadliest year of

4107
02:48:14,951 --> 02:48:16,860
traffic fatalities since 2008.
Yeah.

4108
02:48:17,020 --> 02:48:19,120
This article doesn't say anything about 
marijuana.

4109
02:48:19,240 --> 02:48:24,240
Not one.
One thing doesn't mention me weed at 

4110
02:48:24,240 --> 02:48:26,701
once.
It does say that it could be attributed 

4111
02:48:26,701 --> 02:48:28,120
to crisis,
people driving more people in the state.

4112
02:48:28,150 --> 02:48:29,080
Sure,
etc.

4113
02:48:29,081 --> 02:48:29,530
Etc.

4114
02:48:29,750 --> 02:48:34,750
Well,
but that's the only thing I'm going to 

4115
02:48:34,750 --> 02:48:37,900
defend myself here because you have 
someone here at the ready and what you 

4116
02:48:37,900 --> 02:48:37,900
do is instead of bringing up 
information,

4117
02:48:37,900 --> 02:48:38,840
this is what happens with christopher 
titus,

4118
02:48:38,841 --> 02:48:43,841
right?
You don't have information that you 

4119
02:48:43,841 --> 02:48:43,841
bring up.
You have another guy.

4120
02:48:43,841 --> 02:48:44,540
I look up a source that you specifically
want him to find.

4121
02:48:44,570 --> 02:48:47,510
I didn't ask him to bring that up.
I brought up Washington post and goes,

4122
02:48:47,511 --> 02:48:49,600
this is what's wrong with your article 
taking the job.

4123
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:55,600
You didn't have a joke.
The joke in there about things like 

4124
02:48:55,600 --> 02:48:57,110
coachella wouldn't exist if there 
weren't even that article.

4125
02:48:57,140 --> 02:48:58,140
That's a joke,
right,

4126
02:48:58,150 --> 02:49:03,150
but the triangle.
Do you think people who smoke pot or 

4127
02:49:03,150 --> 02:49:03,150
morton's?
No.

4128
02:49:03,150 --> 02:49:03,150
It's a joke.
Okay,

4129
02:49:03,150 --> 02:49:03,290
let's not do that.
Let's not do that.

4130
02:49:03,500 --> 02:49:06,140
And know pot's not comparable to 
alcohol.

4131
02:49:06,141 --> 02:49:09,480
There are tests that how much alcohol 
content is in your bloodstream.

4132
02:49:09,690 --> 02:49:14,690
We can't yet do that with weed.
So it's impossible to handle these 

4133
02:49:14,690 --> 02:49:14,690
incidents in the same way.
That's what they're happy.

4134
02:49:14,690 --> 02:49:18,980
Okay,
but there have been tasks where they 

4135
02:49:18,980 --> 02:49:20,391
showed people,
but that will go back to what he said 

4136
02:49:20,391 --> 02:49:22,551
and what you said have been tasked with 
they've shown people drunk versus on 

4137
02:49:22,551 --> 02:49:24,540
marijuana and the people on marijuana 
drove far better.

4138
02:49:24,570 --> 02:49:25,380
Okay,
that's true.

4139
02:49:25,381 --> 02:49:27,400
So this is also anecdotal.
No,

4140
02:49:27,510 --> 02:49:29,180
it goes back to your point,
right?

4141
02:49:29,860 --> 02:49:32,720
Let's say someone has alcohol tests the.
Well I don't,

4142
02:49:32,760 --> 02:49:34,020
I haven't read your test.
Okay.

4143
02:49:34,021 --> 02:49:39,021
So what are you arguing against them?
I'm saying I agree with your point 

4144
02:49:39,021 --> 02:49:39,021
earlier.
So why are you saying that the.

4145
02:49:39,021 --> 02:49:44,010
Well it is anecdotal.
If you're saying some people drive 

4146
02:49:44,010 --> 02:49:44,010
better on marijuana.
I'm not saying that.

4147
02:49:44,010 --> 02:49:47,571
I've said there have been tests.
Would they have shown that people drive 

4148
02:49:47,571 --> 02:49:47,571
better on marijuana than alcohol?

4149
02:49:47,571 --> 02:49:52,290
If you want anecdotal.
My point is if we're going to be really 

4150
02:49:52,290 --> 02:49:52,740
good at this argument and just settle 
down,

4151
02:49:52,741 --> 02:49:57,741
you said you wouldn't pile on and you 
got two people talking to talk and when 

4152
02:49:58,830 --> 02:50:01,050
someone brought on the show,
when someone comes on the show,

4153
02:50:01,260 --> 02:50:03,540
jared cannot enter.
Congratulations,

4154
02:50:03,541 --> 02:50:08,541
you're not on the show,
and all he did was pull up bringing up 

4155
02:50:08,541 --> 02:50:09,060
information.
Me without a laptop.

4156
02:50:09,090 --> 02:50:12,330
No,
he brought it up about it.

4157
02:50:12,420 --> 02:50:14,550
You said what would be the one thing 
that you've changed your mind on?

4158
02:50:14,551 --> 02:50:16,960
A similar problem with two people are 
correct and you're incorrect.

4159
02:50:16,961 --> 02:50:18,690
Does that bother you?
I don't agree that you're correct.

4160
02:50:18,750 --> 02:50:23,750
What are you talking about?
You just pulled up some statistics that 

4161
02:50:23,750 --> 02:50:25,450
show the Colorado has less traffic 
fatalities in statistics.

4162
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:28,200
He did.
you just kill you.

4163
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:31,770
I will give you the laptop.
I'll turn my laptop and you can.

4164
02:50:31,790 --> 02:50:36,790
You can pull up the shows contract.
What is the issue that you would care 

4165
02:50:36,790 --> 02:50:36,790
about the least that you've changed your
mind?

4166
02:50:36,790 --> 02:50:37,830
I said probably wouldn't even talk 
about.

4167
02:50:37,850 --> 02:50:40,710
That's.
That's a long version of what you said.

4168
02:50:41,050 --> 02:50:46,050
Well,
was there have been more fatalities 

4169
02:50:46,050 --> 02:50:46,420
since marijuana has been legal in those 
days?

4170
02:50:46,421 --> 02:50:47,550
The things we've discussed,
not true.

4171
02:50:47,580 --> 02:50:52,580
Why are you so obsessed with the body?
Because you're not right and it doesn't 

4172
02:50:52,580 --> 02:50:53,970
matter if we've talked about it for four
hours in this instance,

4173
02:50:53,971 --> 02:50:55,260
you are incorrect.
You know,

4174
02:50:55,261 --> 02:51:00,261
you're correct in that instance that 
traffic fatalities have increased in 

4175
02:51:00,261 --> 02:51:02,961
areas where pod of increased.
We did the same study in Michigan where 

4176
02:51:02,961 --> 02:51:05,451
pot was legalized and people were 
actually selling more marijuana to 

4177
02:51:05,451 --> 02:51:08,560
underage kids.
I don't care if that doesn't have 

4178
02:51:08,560 --> 02:51:08,560
anything to do with traffic to get 
tapped to do with it.

4179
02:51:08,560 --> 02:51:12,111
It doesn't have anything to do with 
traffic fatalities unless you can prove 

4180
02:51:12,111 --> 02:51:12,111
there's more traffic fatalities and 
underage kids.

4181
02:51:12,111 --> 02:51:13,170
Since marijuana has been legal.
Yeah.

4182
02:51:13,410 --> 02:51:15,390
There've been several articles that have
made that claim,

4183
02:51:15,391 --> 02:51:17,250
made that assertion.
What's been written about it?

4184
02:51:17,280 --> 02:51:20,220
Let's find them.
They all come from one article mostly,

4185
02:51:20,221 --> 02:51:25,221
and it's from the aaa stats and the 
stats that they said it was almost all 

4186
02:51:25,221 --> 02:51:27,150
the articles you're talking about coming
from this one article.

4187
02:51:27,460 --> 02:51:32,460
Okay,
so this is the percentage of drivers 

4188
02:51:32,460 --> 02:51:34,551
involved in fatal crashes who recently 
used marijuana more than doubled from 

4189
02:51:34,551 --> 02:51:38,811
eight to 17 percent from 2014 or 2013 
and 2014.

4190
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:44,000
One in six drivers involved in fatal 
crashes from 2014 had recently used 

4191
02:51:44,401 --> 02:51:49,401
marijuana,
which is the most recent data available 

4192
02:51:49,401 --> 02:51:49,740
now.
Do you understand the consequences?

4193
02:51:49,850 --> 02:51:54,450
Middles crashes involving marijuana is a
charming says who opinion.

4194
02:51:54,810 --> 02:51:59,810
That's an opinion.
President and ceo of aaa foundation 

4195
02:51:59,810 --> 02:51:59,810
alarming.
Well is that,

4196
02:51:59,810 --> 02:52:03,400
is that a batter of more people smoking 
marijuana because it's legal or it's a.

4197
02:52:03,600 --> 02:52:06,700
Is it a matter of the marijuana causing 
these accidents?

4198
02:52:06,701 --> 02:52:08,920
Is this no one article put out but no 
one else is true?

4199
02:52:08,980 --> 02:52:13,980
Do you knoW what else is true that all 
these people also had alcohol in their 

4200
02:52:13,980 --> 02:52:13,980
system?
Do you know that?

4201
02:52:13,980 --> 02:52:13,980
Well,
no.

4202
02:52:13,980 --> 02:52:18,420
We don't know that all of the tech gIant
percentage of something that's you know 

4203
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:21,010
this to be true because I've read these.
He had alcohol in their system.

4204
02:52:21,090 --> 02:52:26,090
Can you prove that?
You just said a lot of them rewind the 

4205
02:52:26,090 --> 02:52:26,090
tape to say all a lot of them.
Well,

4206
02:52:26,090 --> 02:52:27,580
you made a lot of.
Let's find out.

4207
02:52:27,581 --> 02:52:32,581
It doesn't say anything in the article 
about alcohol though and for sure they 

4208
02:52:32,581 --> 02:52:36,091
should have tested that shoes for sure.
They can't test for a cup of joy and 

4209
02:52:37,031 --> 02:52:39,130
just google made him do it.
Anything.

4210
02:52:39,150 --> 02:52:44,150
It's a point that you're going to have 
an obvious position that would disagree 

4211
02:52:44,150 --> 02:52:44,500
with this one single article,
so if I can finish a point,

4212
02:52:44,501 --> 02:52:45,520
you've talked about interruption.

4213
02:52:45,520 --> 02:52:46,990
Let me finish the one point that I'm 
making.

4214
02:52:47,080 --> 02:52:48,810
Well,
you marijuana,

4215
02:52:48,811 --> 02:52:51,070
you've already test for marijuana 
roadside,

4216
02:52:51,071 --> 02:52:51,970
right?
Can wE agree On that?

4217
02:52:51,971 --> 02:52:56,971
You absolutely.
Can you just do tests because there's 

4218
02:52:56,971 --> 02:52:56,971
new tests.
Test.

4219
02:52:56,971 --> 02:52:58,230
Let's find out.
Before you do that,

4220
02:52:58,560 --> 02:53:00,940
what you said,
how many of the hour,

4221
02:53:00,970 --> 02:53:05,620
how many of the marijuana related 
fatalities also involved alcohol because

4222
02:53:05,621 --> 02:53:07,930
it's a massively significant percentage.
Yeah,

4223
02:53:08,290 --> 02:53:13,290
so you can't necessarily say that just 
because they have these new tests for 

4224
02:53:13,290 --> 02:53:17,551
marijuana,
especially roadsides barrel problem is 

4225
02:53:17,551 --> 02:53:17,551
he can't.
Okay.

4226
02:53:17,551 --> 02:53:17,980
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you that.

4227
02:53:18,640 --> 02:53:20,410
What do you give them?
Let's say you'Re correct,

4228
02:53:20,411 --> 02:53:21,760
but here's the thing,
so let's test indirect.

4229
02:53:21,761 --> 02:53:26,761
Physiologically,
it doesn't have an effect on motor 

4230
02:53:26,761 --> 02:53:27,850
skills the way alcohol does or it 
doesn't slow down your response time.

4231
02:53:27,910 --> 02:53:30,130
Well,
I know that we've had several doctors in

4232
02:53:30,131 --> 02:53:32,170
the show with two of whom had differing 
opinions on that.

4233
02:53:32,710 --> 02:53:36,010
They don't have to be right.
The iranians have it.

4234
02:53:36,011 --> 02:53:41,011
Do they smoke marijuana themselves?
Do they knoW what it's like to get into 

4235
02:53:41,011 --> 02:53:44,941
this?
This whole study studies on cbs news 

4236
02:53:44,941 --> 02:53:48,541
caught blatantly distorting cannabis 
study says this doubles fatal because 

4237
02:53:48,541 --> 02:53:49,810
comes from mini press news,
minipress news.

4238
02:53:50,290 --> 02:53:55,290
So again,
we can go into questioning sources all 

4239
02:53:55,290 --> 02:53:57,090
day long.
If you have someone else bringing up 

4240
02:53:57,090 --> 02:53:57,090
something just as a good source.
You think maybe,

4241
02:53:57,090 --> 02:53:57,160
maybe it is.
Let's say you're right crowder,

4242
02:53:57,161 --> 02:54:00,100
but let's say what letter can we sourced
out to something else?

4243
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:03,010
I know you guys went on one issue and 
you said,

4244
02:54:03,070 --> 02:54:03,820
hold on.
What's the issue?

4245
02:54:03,821 --> 02:54:05,500
You don't care about your sources right 
here.

4246
02:54:05,501 --> 02:54:10,501
I've looked them up.
There's people online also sourcing 

4247
02:54:10,501 --> 02:54:10,501
them.
They are skewed.

4248
02:54:10,501 --> 02:54:14,490
You're skewing them to make ends.
George Washington post study that you 

4249
02:54:14,490 --> 02:54:14,490
skewed,
but you're not the Washington post.

4250
02:54:14,490 --> 02:54:15,990
You're supposed to be the answer to the 
Washington post.

4251
02:54:16,100 --> 02:54:18,160
The Washington post.
Don't say that someone's evil,

4252
02:54:18,161 --> 02:54:20,290
so I'm evil to what you just said.
Is that what you're saying?

4253
02:54:20,291 --> 02:54:22,420
That's the argument that you just know I
didn't make that better.

4254
02:54:22,690 --> 02:54:24,400
Just said,
come on man.

4255
02:54:24,401 --> 02:54:27,040
It's made that argument and all of a 
sudden when someone mentions pot,

4256
02:54:27,070 --> 02:54:32,070
you put on the along your worldview with
the lens of we know you get upset with 

4257
02:54:32,780 --> 02:54:36,310
holy shit has nothing to do with eat,
but you haven't made an argument.

4258
02:54:36,490 --> 02:54:38,040
I haven't made an argument.
You said,

4259
02:54:39,640 --> 02:54:41,720
we showed you what he wrote about this 
app.

4260
02:54:41,830 --> 02:54:46,830
What have you shown me?
We showed you the statistics show that 

4261
02:54:46,830 --> 02:54:49,651
marijuana and traffic violations,
they may not be causal accident.

4262
02:54:50,301 --> 02:54:52,670
right?
Okay,

4263
02:54:52,810 --> 02:54:57,730
so what else is causing the drop number 
and why keep increasing number?

4264
02:54:57,850 --> 02:55:00,480
What increased?
This fake increase from failure?

4265
02:55:00,490 --> 02:55:02,590
Bringing fake news.
It's not real.

4266
02:55:02,740 --> 02:55:05,060
It's real cowboy shows.
It's not real.

4267
02:55:05,560 --> 02:55:06,500
Is it real?
What was this?

4268
02:55:06,501 --> 02:55:09,340
It comes from is aaa study.
That was trip lands council.

4269
02:55:09,470 --> 02:55:14,470
Aaa is owned by the bilderberg group.
You don't even know this and now we're 

4270
02:55:14,470 --> 02:55:17,660
going to go to cures cancer and people 
having meetings and rams has got one.

4271
02:55:17,930 --> 02:55:22,930
One article that says one thing and one 
article from Colorado that says there's 

4272
02:55:22,930 --> 02:55:24,040
been a decrease in traffic fatalities.
Right?

4273
02:55:24,140 --> 02:55:25,910
You're not willing to recognize that.
I just said,

4274
02:55:25,911 --> 02:55:30,911
let's give that to you because this 
entire conversation started with you 

4275
02:55:30,911 --> 02:55:32,630
saying what issue would you change your 
mind on a pot?

4276
02:55:32,680 --> 02:55:36,500
Because this argument started with you 
saying that it causes more fatalities,

4277
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:38,590
traffic violations.
That's not true.

4278
02:55:38,620 --> 02:55:40,040
You said,
which is you do not care about.

4279
02:55:40,100 --> 02:55:42,800
I say hot trend.
Why?

4280
02:55:43,250 --> 02:55:45,110
What's your opinion on pot?
And I said,

4281
02:55:45,170 --> 02:55:46,580
I really don't care if people want to 
smoke pot.

4282
02:55:46,580 --> 02:55:48,740
I think it's a state issue.
I honestly don't care.

4283
02:55:48,741 --> 02:55:51,050
I've changed my mind.
Where as a kid I thought it was harmful.

4284
02:55:51,110 --> 02:55:56,110
I don't think it's harmful.
And you say that it causes more traffic 

4285
02:55:56,110 --> 02:55:56,110
fatality.
Then you said,

4286
02:55:56,110 --> 02:55:58,790
well let's expand on this.
What issue do you have with pot?

4287
02:55:58,791 --> 02:56:00,680
I said,
I don't like the dishonesty where people

4288
02:56:00,681 --> 02:56:03,560
just say it cures cancer.
It'll end the war on drugs.

4289
02:56:03,810 --> 02:56:06,470
It's,
it's completely harmless and I have some

4290
02:56:06,471 --> 02:56:07,920
arguments that are entirely.
No,

4291
02:56:07,940 --> 02:56:09,380
it's not entirely harmless.
Well,

4292
02:56:09,381 --> 02:56:14,060
it's not without consequences.
Consequences are so much leeway there.

4293
02:56:14,480 --> 02:56:16,140
How have you have you?
Bay,

4294
02:56:16,180 --> 02:56:21,180
big consequences based started from me 
saying I probably couldn't care less 

4295
02:56:21,180 --> 02:56:24,911
about this out of all the other issues 
that we discussed and you lasered in on 

4296
02:56:24,911 --> 02:56:25,650
that and go,
where do we disagree on this?

4297
02:56:26,860 --> 02:56:28,460
No,
because it's a huge blind spot.

4298
02:56:28,490 --> 02:56:33,450
No,
it's not huge blind spots out there that

4299
02:56:33,740 --> 02:56:38,740
if you say that marijuana is in some Way
or another a dangerous thing.

4300
02:56:39,910 --> 02:56:41,220
Yeah.
I can tell you that it's not.

4301
02:56:41,230 --> 02:56:42,500
No,
I didn't say in a dangerous thing.

4302
02:56:44,030 --> 02:56:45,200
What are the consequences?
Okay.

4303
02:56:45,201 --> 02:56:46,730
What is.
What do you believe marijuana does,

4304
02:56:46,731 --> 02:56:47,420
for example?
Well,

4305
02:56:47,480 --> 02:56:52,480
no,
I'm not going to get baited into this 

4306
02:56:52,480 --> 02:56:52,480
because you're gonna.
You're gonna.

4307
02:56:52,480 --> 02:56:53,570
You're trying to force me to say that I 
don't think pot cures cancer and there's

4308
02:56:53,571 --> 02:56:54,890
a big farm now listen,
smoke pot.

4309
02:56:55,480 --> 02:56:56,660
Now.
That's not what I will ask this.

4310
02:56:56,661 --> 02:56:59,030
I was saying,
what are the consequences of you come on

4311
02:56:59,390 --> 02:57:02,100
my show.
I'd love to have a discussion about it.

4312
02:57:03,440 --> 02:57:06,690
I think so.
Unless you're in front of me.

4313
02:57:06,691 --> 02:57:11,691
Why now?
Why don't you and I right now you're 

4314
02:57:11,691 --> 02:57:11,810
having a conversation with,
oh,

4315
02:57:11,811 --> 02:57:13,190
that's not good to read.

4316
02:57:13,190 --> 02:57:15,320
Smart says it's not fair to have two 
people,

4317
02:57:15,321 --> 02:57:18,770
it's Just like before he take a Room 
with no internet.

4318
02:57:18,771 --> 02:57:23,771
Think of amy and I ganged up on.
You think you would have done well in 

4319
02:57:23,771 --> 02:57:23,771
that argument.
Come on man,

4320
02:57:23,771 --> 02:57:26,890
because I want to find out how you feel.
Think and want to see if you get 

4321
02:57:26,890 --> 02:57:29,710
defensive for some reason.
You said you think of her and I worked 

4322
02:57:29,710 --> 02:57:32,201
together.
You think you would have done well on 

4323
02:57:32,201 --> 02:57:32,201
that because I want to see if you get 
defensive,

4324
02:57:32,201 --> 02:57:35,510
but when someone's coming into 
conversation with someone that you do 

4325
02:57:35,510 --> 02:57:35,510
that,
right?

4326
02:57:35,510 --> 02:57:35,510
No,
no,

4327
02:57:35,510 --> 02:57:36,440
but you've made it the hall about the 
pod issue.

4328
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:38,150
No,
that had nothing to do with pod.

4329
02:57:38,151 --> 02:57:43,151
The amy shouldn't have gotten into this 
pot issue because of the issue was 

4330
02:57:43,151 --> 02:57:45,080
brought up and it's the one area that 
you're super,

4331
02:57:45,081 --> 02:57:48,140
super adorable.
You're adorable,

4332
02:57:48,170 --> 02:57:49,190
and there's the same thing.

4333
02:57:49,210 --> 02:57:51,580
If you're not a real comedian.
No,

4334
02:57:51,590 --> 02:57:56,590
you're adorable.
You're going to date someone on an open 

4335
02:57:56,590 --> 02:57:56,590
territory without someone else to back 
up your argument.

4336
02:57:56,590 --> 02:58:01,331
It's never happened.
If it looks back up when someone pulls 

4337
02:58:01,331 --> 02:58:01,331
up information,
let me check.

4338
02:58:01,331 --> 02:58:04,050
Really does is he pulls up evidence to 
the contrary.

4339
02:58:04,170 --> 02:58:09,170
If I was wrong,
he would stick it right in my face and 

4340
02:58:09,170 --> 02:58:09,170
we would laugh about it and that's what 
he does.

4341
02:58:09,170 --> 02:58:10,570
That's why he pulled up a trip,
the country,

4342
02:58:10,571 --> 02:58:13,140
and I've given it to you.
What tense do you haven't given me?

4343
02:58:13,141 --> 02:58:14,940
Shit.
I know I've given you the argument.

4344
02:58:15,100 --> 02:58:16,560
What are your command?
I'm fine.

4345
02:58:16,561 --> 02:58:18,030
Let's say there's no.
There's no causation.

4346
02:58:18,031 --> 02:58:19,740
let's say that wasn't backed up well 
enough.

4347
02:58:19,741 --> 02:58:20,850
Let's give you the argument.
Okay.

4348
02:58:21,030 --> 02:58:26,030
What's this?
Jamie was also some evidence that 

4349
02:58:26,030 --> 02:58:27,980
medical marijuana laws to decrease in 
traffic.

4350
02:58:28,390 --> 02:58:30,720
What of me doing this though?

4351
02:58:30,720 --> 02:58:32,430
If we don't do that,
this is what we always do.

4352
02:58:32,431 --> 02:58:34,590
It's just talking about facts.
listen,

4353
02:58:35,060 --> 02:58:36,740
hold please.
There are some.

4354
02:58:37,350 --> 02:58:40,500
There are also some evidence that 
medical that doesn't make any sense.

4355
02:58:40,501 --> 02:58:43,800
There are also some evidence that 
there's also.

4356
02:58:44,600 --> 02:58:49,600
I'm wrong,
that medical marijuana laws may 

4357
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:49,600
contribute to decreasing traffic 
fatalities.

4358
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:53,130
One study published in the journal of 
law and economics in 2013,

4359
02:58:53,131 --> 02:58:58,131
reviewed traffic fatalities in the 19 
states that have passed medical 

4360
02:58:58,131 --> 02:59:01,521
marijuana laws by 2010 and found that 
legalization is associated with an eight

4361
02:59:02,701 --> 02:59:07,701
to 11 percent decrease in traffic 
fatalities for the year after the laws 

4362
02:59:07,701 --> 02:59:12,291
took effect.
The researchers from the university of 

4363
02:59:12,291 --> 02:59:14,271
Colorado,
denver and elsewhere also found the 

4364
02:59:14,271 --> 02:59:16,980
decrease is more significant for alcohol
related fatalities.

4365
02:59:16,981 --> 02:59:19,380
At 13 point two percent ask a question.
Interesting.

4366
02:59:19,381 --> 02:59:20,610
Can I ask a question?
Please do.

4367
02:59:20,970 --> 02:59:25,970
Why is that study from 2010 considered 
completely valid to you in the study 

4368
02:59:25,970 --> 02:59:27,980
from aaa in 2014 considered completely 
triple a's.

4369
02:59:27,990 --> 02:59:30,990
GoT a fucking biased in ago because 
there you go.

4370
02:59:31,940 --> 02:59:34,460
The gas company and have different 
opinions.

4371
02:59:34,461 --> 02:59:35,310
Charge.
Well,

4372
02:59:35,311 --> 02:59:38,280
what are they basing it on?
What your argument is?

4373
02:59:38,281 --> 02:59:40,950
This is.
This is the only valid study because aaa

4374
02:59:40,951 --> 02:59:42,300
is,
but this is a study.

4375
02:59:42,940 --> 02:59:44,490
You ignore it.
Do you think that's right?

4376
02:59:44,491 --> 02:59:45,690
I think they're lying to me,
right?

4377
02:59:45,960 --> 02:59:47,400
I think it could be right.
So if they're right,

4378
02:59:47,401 --> 02:59:48,840
if that studies right then you were 
wrong,

4379
02:59:48,841 --> 02:59:49,740
right?
If that.

4380
02:59:49,741 --> 02:59:51,560
What if that study's right?
They knew right?

4381
02:59:51,840 --> 02:59:53,100
I could be wrong.
You were wrong,

4382
02:59:53,101 --> 02:59:54,540
right when you were just shouting it 
out.

4383
02:59:54,630 --> 02:59:56,700
So we proved that in Colorado.
You were wrong.

4384
02:59:56,701 --> 02:59:58,110
You didn't.
If that study is true,

4385
02:59:58,310 --> 03:00:00,270
well you didn't prep.
You said if that's what you do,

4386
03:00:01,520 --> 03:00:06,090
what can to ask one question and then 
you get a paragraph.

4387
03:00:06,810 --> 03:00:08,410
You're doing this,
don't you,

4388
03:00:08,590 --> 03:00:13,590
joe,
you give it to you win the argument and 

4389
03:00:13,590 --> 03:00:13,920
you bring up another thing about pot.

4390
03:00:14,070 --> 03:00:15,240
Well,
it's because you don't.

4391
03:00:15,780 --> 03:00:18,260
You don't really give up.
You reluctantly give up.

4392
03:00:18,450 --> 03:00:21,300
Give it to your right.
Let's assume you're definitely wrong.

4393
03:00:21,301 --> 03:00:22,410
Let's assume I'm wrong.
Okay?

4394
03:00:22,411 --> 03:00:24,960
So what else would be the problem with 
marijuana if it wasn't?

4395
03:00:24,961 --> 03:00:26,400
Traffic fatalities?
Zero,

4396
03:00:26,401 --> 03:00:27,240
right?
No,

4397
03:00:27,241 --> 03:00:28,560
not zero,
zero,

4398
03:00:28,561 --> 03:00:30,310
but I don't want to spend the entire day
talking about.

4399
03:00:30,730 --> 03:00:31,560
Well,
let's come on man.

4400
03:00:31,561 --> 03:00:33,060
We're talking about real issues.
What would it be?

4401
03:00:33,061 --> 03:00:35,430
The other problems it wasn't for 
different before you go,

4402
03:00:35,431 --> 03:00:36,330
oh man,
just loosen up.

4403
03:00:36,331 --> 03:00:38,510
Let's talk about life in jujitsu.
Then you get into one thing.

4404
03:00:39,110 --> 03:00:40,470
So I said,
let's talk.

4405
03:00:40,950 --> 03:00:44,070
I just want to get you away from your 
left versus right talking points because

4406
03:00:44,090 --> 03:00:47,400
I'm lucky because people with 
convictions paradigm,

4407
03:00:47,940 --> 03:00:52,900
bertrand russell for central.
I kinda am joe.

4408
03:00:53,280 --> 03:00:54,120
Joe.
here's the thing,

4409
03:00:54,210 --> 03:00:57,480
and I started off very and I still mean 
the complementary things I said,

4410
03:00:57,960 --> 03:01:01,800
but you can't bring people on and called
them pussy and dumped box.

4411
03:01:02,570 --> 03:01:07,570
I cAn then continue going back to an 
issue and with with someone who agrees 

4412
03:01:07,631 --> 03:01:10,020
with you entirely and act as though,
well,

4413
03:01:10,030 --> 03:01:11,380
someone will now you're defensive.
Well,

4414
03:01:11,381 --> 03:01:12,550
of course I'm defensive.
Well,

4415
03:01:12,551 --> 03:01:17,551
I think that you were spewing a little 
bit of anti marijuana propaganda about 

4416
03:01:17,551 --> 03:01:20,140
traffic fatalities that I had an address
on a pair of propaganda.

4417
03:01:20,170 --> 03:01:23,350
That's right.
Unpaid bond payments paid by anybody,

4418
03:01:23,351 --> 03:01:26,680
but I just think you had a point of view
that pushed the propaganda,

4419
03:01:26,710 --> 03:01:31,710
but propaganda by definition means I 
have to be pushing for someone 

4420
03:01:31,710 --> 03:01:32,650
necessarily that someone is telling you 
to do it.

4421
03:01:32,680 --> 03:01:37,680
it's just that you had a point.
It's propaganda you had dug your heels 

4422
03:01:37,680 --> 03:01:38,400
in and it's not propaganda.
It's wrong.

4423
03:01:38,990 --> 03:01:42,760
It's wrong if you have read it and you 
are spouting it out,

4424
03:01:42,761 --> 03:01:44,710
but that statistics prove different.
Okay,

4425
03:01:44,860 --> 03:01:47,950
and then I would say it's propaganda or 
someone takes yours cancer.

4426
03:01:48,070 --> 03:01:50,310
I'm not saying you're promoting pump 
again to like someone.

4427
03:01:50,900 --> 03:01:52,390
Okay,
pull that up.

4428
03:01:52,391 --> 03:01:55,080
Then we can find out what not saying 
cures.

4429
03:01:55,090 --> 03:01:57,280
Does that matter why it has my 
unofficial effect?

4430
03:01:57,281 --> 03:01:57,700
No,
no,

4431
03:01:57,701 --> 03:01:58,600
no.
That wasn't my claim.

4432
03:01:59,380 --> 03:02:00,790
Yours cancer.
Nothing.

4433
03:02:00,800 --> 03:02:02,950
Treat cancer and that was what I was 
talking about.

4434
03:02:02,951 --> 03:02:06,050
I literally will get nothing.
Cures anything mean things.

4435
03:02:06,090 --> 03:02:10,210
Truth of your listeners will tweet me 
saying that cures anything.

4436
03:02:10,211 --> 03:02:12,160
Things treat things.
Your immune system kicks in.

4437
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:15,580
System fails of drugs like heroin.
Okay?

4438
03:02:15,581 --> 03:02:18,160
What?
What trulio cures things.

4439
03:02:18,190 --> 03:02:18,850
Polio.
Vaccine.

4440
03:02:19,350 --> 03:02:21,310
Polio vaccine doesn't cure things you 
fuck.

4441
03:02:21,311 --> 03:02:26,311
It prevents you from getting polio.
Disease is you understand what you just 

4442
03:02:26,311 --> 03:02:27,160
said.
You just yourself.

4443
03:02:27,190 --> 03:02:32,190
No,
I didn't know what the disease is not 

4444
03:02:32,190 --> 03:02:32,190
effectively cured in the person who has 
polio.

4445
03:02:32,190 --> 03:02:36,660
We're talking about marijuana curing 
cancer on people that don't have cancer 

4446
03:02:36,660 --> 03:02:36,660
yet.
That's not what.

4447
03:02:36,660 --> 03:02:40,630
It's not a vaccine for cancer.
What you're saying is marijuana cures 

4448
03:02:40,630 --> 03:02:41,380
cancer with people that have cancer.
There's not a fucking drug.

4449
03:02:41,410 --> 03:02:46,410
You proved yourself not only agree 
medicine that proves that you can't 

4450
03:02:46,631 --> 03:02:51,631
fucking cure polio with a medicine.
You get so aggressive on your example 

4451
03:02:55,510 --> 03:02:56,920
right now.
You have a blind spot.

4452
03:02:56,950 --> 03:02:59,500
I'm pretty sure there's drugs out there 
that cure some diseases.

4453
03:02:59,770 --> 03:03:01,060
I'm sure there are.
I've never heard of them.

4454
03:03:02,920 --> 03:03:03,370
Well,
they.

4455
03:03:03,371 --> 03:03:07,420
You know their name one not off hand.
If I had someone who could bring it up,

4456
03:03:07,480 --> 03:03:08,590
no,
you don't have to bring it up,

4457
03:03:08,591 --> 03:03:09,820
man.
You're going to argue for it.

4458
03:03:09,821 --> 03:03:12,170
Shouldn't argue for it.
I don't think.

4459
03:03:14,010 --> 03:03:16,240
I think that's incorrect.
You're in.

4460
03:03:16,270 --> 03:03:19,150
Your immune system has to be in place.
If you are a fuck,

4461
03:03:19,151 --> 03:03:23,080
if you're dying and someone gives you 
some sort of a drug,

4462
03:03:23,290 --> 03:03:28,290
how many drugs are there that cure a 
nasty disease that's killing you and how

4463
03:03:28,571 --> 03:03:31,690
many of them have to be also 
compensated?

4464
03:03:31,720 --> 03:03:33,220
Your immune system has to kick in as 
well.

4465
03:03:33,221 --> 03:03:35,470
There's a bunch of factors.
It's not like how many.

4466
03:03:35,590 --> 03:03:38,170
I mean there's penicillin that kills 
some.

4467
03:03:38,440 --> 03:03:41,440
Some like venereal diseases and all 
sorts of different.

4468
03:03:41,441 --> 03:03:45,610
Fucking horrible infections.
There's not a lot,

4469
03:03:45,780 --> 03:03:47,990
but it takes your immune system has to 
be an effect too.

4470
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:49,250
There's,
there's a lot of factors.

4471
03:03:49,270 --> 03:03:50,880
Now we're going to the definition of 
cure and saying,

4472
03:03:51,210 --> 03:03:56,210
man,
because you're talking about fucking 

4473
03:03:56,210 --> 03:03:56,210
polio.
Nothing curious.

4474
03:03:56,210 --> 03:03:56,210
Polio,
bitch and marijuana.

4475
03:03:56,210 --> 03:03:58,040
No one's saying marijuana all the time.

4476
03:03:58,220 --> 03:03:59,690
All the time.
It's just you're assholes.

4477
03:03:59,990 --> 03:04:04,990
Does people that say you're a nazi,
those the same people that say you're a 

4478
03:04:04,990 --> 03:04:04,990
nazi?
No,

4479
03:04:04,990 --> 03:04:05,190
it's pretty common.
It's pretty funky.

4480
03:04:05,191 --> 03:04:06,770
Nazi punching.
For example,

4481
03:04:06,771 --> 03:04:09,800
we had a woman on the show at a woman on
the show psychiatrist who basically said

4482
03:04:09,801 --> 03:04:10,570
she said,
uh,

4483
03:04:10,610 --> 03:04:13,970
people who are adult healthy smoke pot 
and probably not a problem.

4484
03:04:14,460 --> 03:04:16,280
So it is a problem for [inaudible] for 
the developing brain.

4485
03:04:16,281 --> 03:04:19,460
People who are under the age of 25.
She explained as to what the correct.

4486
03:04:19,630 --> 03:04:21,520
Then she explained as to why it's.
I don't think they,

4487
03:04:21,620 --> 03:04:24,140
they think that the human brain is even 
fully developed.

4488
03:04:24,180 --> 03:04:29,180
You're not text.
And she talked about specifically also 

4489
03:04:29,180 --> 03:04:29,500
people who might have mental illnesses,
whether it's schizophrenia,

4490
03:04:29,510 --> 03:04:34,510
bipolar.
Most people don't realize that or 

4491
03:04:34,510 --> 03:04:36,221
depression.
It goes unrecognized and she talked 

4492
03:04:36,221 --> 03:04:38,531
about how for those people,
marijuana can act as a trigger 

4493
03:04:38,531 --> 03:04:38,531
mechanism,
so she said,

4494
03:04:38,531 --> 03:04:38,600
healthy people,
none of these conditions,

4495
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:43,960
marijuana is probably relatively benign,
but for some of these people and most 

4496
03:04:43,960 --> 03:04:44,300
people who might have these conditions 
are afflicted by them.

4497
03:04:44,570 --> 03:04:47,660
It could be a real problem.
She's got some very good points,

4498
03:04:47,661 --> 03:04:50,600
but dna are,
we'd cures cancer.

4499
03:04:50,601 --> 03:04:52,640
This dumb bitch should get off the show,
do this.

4500
03:04:52,670 --> 03:04:55,760
Cannabis has been shown to kill cancer 
cells in laboratory testing.

4501
03:04:55,761 --> 03:05:00,761
question six,
you know that doesn't cure cancer 

4502
03:05:00,761 --> 03:05:00,761
though.
KiLl cancer cells.

4503
03:05:00,761 --> 03:05:02,060
No one's saying cure cancer.
It's beneficial effects.

4504
03:05:02,061 --> 03:05:05,510
I'm telling you exactly what people say,
that you compared it to tumeric.

4505
03:05:05,511 --> 03:05:07,660
You compare these things,
but look,

4506
03:05:07,930 --> 03:05:12,930
the the point being,
I think you agree and I agree that as 

4507
03:05:12,930 --> 03:05:17,621
long as it doesn't hurt other people any
more than anything else like sugar 

4508
03:05:17,621 --> 03:05:17,690
hurts,
other people.

4509
03:05:17,691 --> 03:05:22,691
Look,
if you want to make an argument for a 

4510
03:05:22,691 --> 03:05:24,740
high insurance rates and you want to 
look at the overall causes of disease in

4511
03:05:24,741 --> 03:05:27,770
this country and why insurance and 
health insurance costs so much,

4512
03:05:27,960 --> 03:05:31,310
you would almost immediately go towards 
simple sugar.

4513
03:05:31,700 --> 03:05:35,660
Simple sugar is a huge problem wiTh 
people who are obese.

4514
03:05:35,810 --> 03:05:40,340
Obesity is a huge issue in this country 
and it's a major factor when it comes to

4515
03:05:40,341 --> 03:05:41,780
healthcare costs.
Right?

4516
03:05:42,620 --> 03:05:47,620
I think it's adorable that you're 
telling me how to craft arguments and I 

4517
03:05:47,620 --> 03:05:51,061
know that you're not saying that it's.
It's an easier argument to say that ice 

4518
03:05:51,611 --> 03:05:54,530
cream should be illegal and is that 
marijuana should be illegal.

4519
03:05:54,620 --> 03:05:55,190
No,
I don't.

4520
03:05:55,480 --> 03:05:57,260
And I think.
Tell me why now I'm to.

4521
03:05:57,261 --> 03:05:58,310
I'm going to say what I was about to 
say.

4522
03:05:58,520 --> 03:06:03,520
please stop beforehand because he keep 
redirecting the conversation and your 

4523
03:06:03,520 --> 03:06:03,520
turn and for some reason you're turning 
it into something hostile that it really

4524
03:06:03,520 --> 03:06:05,570
doesn't need to be hostile.
Might be to you.

4525
03:06:05,870 --> 03:06:07,070
Yeah.
It didn't feel weird about it.

4526
03:06:07,071 --> 03:06:07,970
I feel great.
It is.

4527
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:09,290
It is.
When someone comes in and somebody where

4528
03:06:09,291 --> 03:06:11,570
they know they disagree and someone out 
to other people have the same opinion,

4529
03:06:11,571 --> 03:06:12,470
are gonna do a team up?

4530
03:06:12,560 --> 03:06:15,530
He doesn't even have to think that what 
you're doing right now,

4531
03:06:15,531 --> 03:06:20,531
joe,
is like you talk about what people in 

4532
03:06:20,531 --> 03:06:22,100
jujitsu is what I think there are now 
100 scientific studies that say that I 

4533
03:06:22,100 --> 03:06:23,420
think that you think these arguments 
where cannabis cures cancer.

4534
03:06:23,421 --> 03:06:25,680
I think that you think he's arguments 
work and I think it's like someone going

4535
03:06:25,681 --> 03:06:27,470
to jujitsu for the first time.
You've never done it.

4536
03:06:28,010 --> 03:06:33,010
I don't think you've ever actually 
gotten to a place without someone who 

4537
03:06:33,010 --> 03:06:35,171
can bring up sources for you.
I don't think you've gotten into an 

4538
03:06:35,171 --> 03:06:37,811
argument or done anything with a debate 
team where people would actually hold 

4539
03:06:37,811 --> 03:06:37,820
you accountable to the argument that you
make.

4540
03:06:38,060 --> 03:06:40,340
I think we're redirecting.
You don't think that I have.

4541
03:06:40,341 --> 03:06:42,460
If you don't know what conversations 
that have never seen,

4542
03:06:42,620 --> 03:06:47,620
so what do you.
Somebody with me 24 slash seven slash 

4543
03:06:47,620 --> 03:06:49,900
nine point is this.
I think you'll be very surprised right 

4544
03:06:49,900 --> 03:06:53,020
now.
You're the kung fu guy hitting the kung 

4545
03:06:53,020 --> 03:06:53,020
fu,
dealt with the spikes,

4546
03:06:53,020 --> 03:06:57,190
and you've convinced yourself that this 
is an argument that would work if you 

4547
03:06:57,190 --> 03:06:57,190
had other people more

4548
03:06:57,190 --> 03:06:59,750
qualified than myself to discuss it and 
you decided to zone in on an artist that

4549
03:07:00,260 --> 03:07:04,260
have you diffusing all these stats that 
jamie keeps bringing up.

4550
03:07:04,261 --> 03:07:09,261
There's more than 100.
Studies exactly proves that cannabis 

4551
03:07:09,261 --> 03:07:09,261
cures cancer.
Exactly.

4552
03:07:09,261 --> 03:07:10,130
Do deny the studies.
You don't need a jamie,

4553
03:07:10,270 --> 03:07:11,720
jamie.
Jamie's pulling shit off the internet.

4554
03:07:11,790 --> 03:07:15,660
You hiding civically about something 
where I changed my mind so clearly we're

4555
03:07:15,661 --> 03:07:20,661
ready or upset about the pot though.
It wasn't a nice thing about that 

4556
03:07:20,661 --> 03:07:24,681
anymore because I don't really care 
about it and I think states should be 

4557
03:07:24,681 --> 03:07:24,681
able to legalize it or if she don't care
about it,

4558
03:07:24,681 --> 03:07:27,300
she fucking touch three followup 
questions.

4559
03:07:27,301 --> 03:07:29,970
It'd be like me asking you why you 
endorsed bernie sanders on thIs show.

4560
03:07:29,971 --> 03:07:31,400
Definitely send you info.
Tom,

4561
03:07:31,710 --> 03:07:35,340
in the green room with the man.
He's insane with the socialist stuff.

4562
03:07:35,341 --> 03:07:36,540
I don't think it's very genuine.

4563
03:07:36,540 --> 03:07:37,380
What you're doing.
What?

4564
03:07:37,650 --> 03:07:40,050
This is something that appeals to.
you know,

4565
03:07:40,200 --> 03:07:45,200
it's not.
You started on with traffic fatalities 

4566
03:07:45,200 --> 03:07:45,270
and start on I guess on with kevin 
tells,

4567
03:07:45,271 --> 03:07:50,271
you said,
what is she up and not talk about and 

4568
03:07:50,271 --> 03:07:50,271
this is exactly why,
right?

4569
03:07:50,271 --> 03:07:54,770
Because we always occur.
That was one of the things he used was 

4570
03:07:54,770 --> 03:07:59,680
wasn't it?
And there's no active conversation that 

4571
03:07:59,680 --> 03:07:59,680
comes from it.
Oh sure.

4572
03:07:59,680 --> 03:08:00,210
There is no.
For people who are listening to this,

4573
03:08:00,211 --> 03:08:05,211
this is extremely productive because 
they understand how someone with 

4574
03:08:05,211 --> 03:08:05,770
blinders could ignore the evidence.
Sure.

4575
03:08:05,970 --> 03:08:10,290
And figure out some way where they're 
being wronged intellectually.

4576
03:08:10,470 --> 03:08:12,930
Someone like someone will say that,
oh,

4577
03:08:12,931 --> 03:08:15,600
you should be in some sort of a debate.
You've never been in a debate.

4578
03:08:15,601 --> 03:08:17,340
You don't know what fucking debates I've
been in.

4579
03:08:17,520 --> 03:08:19,950
You know what?
No televised.

4580
03:08:19,951 --> 03:08:22,980
Right?
you know you don't know what I'm calling

4581
03:08:22,981 --> 03:08:23,490
you on your bullshit.

4582
03:08:24,790 --> 03:08:29,790
You're saying,
I've never had a conversation with you 

4583
03:08:29,790 --> 03:08:32,930
and steven were having fun.
Why is this bullyiNg?

4584
03:08:33,550 --> 03:08:35,970
It's because there are two people who 
hold one opinion,

4585
03:08:35,971 --> 03:08:37,590
asked me on something that I don't care 
about.

4586
03:08:37,591 --> 03:08:42,591
Followup three,
four questIons to go into an area where 

4587
03:08:42,591 --> 03:08:43,290
you two are so very specifically 
passionate and I said,

4588
03:08:43,291 --> 03:08:48,291
I don't want to talk about it.
you don't want to talk about it because 

4589
03:08:48,291 --> 03:08:48,291
you're wrong.
No,

4590
03:08:48,291 --> 03:08:48,680
I don't want to tell because I don't 
care because he keeps showing stage.

4591
03:08:48,681 --> 03:08:49,980
Want to legalize it.
That's fine,

4592
03:08:50,160 --> 03:08:55,160
but it is a valid issue.
When people of Colorado are looking at 

4593
03:08:55,160 --> 03:08:58,071
this now and there are people in 
Colorado who might vote differently on 

4594
03:08:58,071 --> 03:09:01,101
the marijuana issue because of how it's 
perceived or because of the information 

4595
03:09:01,101 --> 03:09:04,431
at hand,
and I believe that people in Colorado 

4596
03:09:04,431 --> 03:09:04,431
she be able to vote.
They voted for pot,

4597
03:09:04,431 --> 03:09:07,580
but if they want to vote the other way 
in states they have the right to do 

4598
03:09:07,580 --> 03:09:07,580
that.

4599
03:09:07,580 --> 03:09:07,580
Who's arguing against that?
Well,

4600
03:09:07,580 --> 03:09:09,150
that was my point when we're talking 
about marijuana.

4601
03:09:09,180 --> 03:09:14,180
My point was when I worked at fox,
we were thrust under panels where you 

4602
03:09:14,180 --> 03:09:16,470
had to talk about this because it was 
going on in Colorado.

4603
03:09:16,500 --> 03:09:19,240
I can't believe you called me a bully.
That's such a left wing arc.

4604
03:09:19,680 --> 03:09:20,850
How dare you.
You are.

4605
03:09:21,090 --> 03:09:24,000
How dare you.
How dare is how early you are,

4606
03:09:24,070 --> 03:09:25,490
but you fax.
No,

4607
03:09:25,620 --> 03:09:30,620
you use this.
I'll use these absolutes and call on it 

4608
03:09:30,620 --> 03:09:30,620
and then say,
well no,

4609
03:09:30,620 --> 03:09:31,500
I'm just joking.
I'm joking.

4610
03:09:31,590 --> 03:09:32,250
What?
Absolutely.

4611
03:09:32,610 --> 03:09:33,180
Well,
okay.

4612
03:09:33,181 --> 03:09:35,240
Let me give you one that I can pull from
my memory to.

4613
03:09:35,490 --> 03:09:38,070
All of them are on alcohol.
that did.

4614
03:09:38,071 --> 03:09:38,970
Fuck that up.
Yeah,

4615
03:09:38,971 --> 03:09:43,971
and you've done it several times,
but we were supposed to be a productive 

4616
03:09:43,971 --> 03:09:43,971
discussion.
Wouldn't be doing that.

4617
03:09:43,971 --> 03:09:45,270
I wouldn't.
I know there's a large number.

4618
03:09:45,510 --> 03:09:48,780
there's a large number of narcan on or 
one of those company.

4619
03:09:48,781 --> 03:09:52,660
One of those.
There was one that was unlikely source.

4620
03:09:52,900 --> 03:09:53,190
Yeah.

4621
03:09:54,100 --> 03:09:55,630
Well you don't tell me you have to leave
now.

4622
03:09:55,770 --> 03:09:57,330
My flight.
Turn this around more.

4623
03:09:57,340 --> 03:09:58,600
You're going to miss your flight no 
matter what.

4624
03:09:58,601 --> 03:10:02,440
Now if you're fucked,
we're going to be fine,

4625
03:10:02,441 --> 03:10:04,000
dude.
Now I'm not going to be fun.

4626
03:10:04,001 --> 03:10:05,020
I'm not gonna.
Make my flight back.

4627
03:10:05,030 --> 03:10:06,430
Yeah,
you're going to be fine.

4628
03:10:06,820 --> 03:10:09,400
You're living in America.
Could be in Ethiopia right now.

4629
03:10:09,760 --> 03:10:12,170
Huddling in a fucking hut.
You know,

4630
03:10:12,190 --> 03:10:14,800
trying to protect yourself from a,
some rabid animal.

4631
03:10:14,860 --> 03:10:16,570
You know,
don't be scared.

4632
03:10:17,020 --> 03:10:18,970
We're going To be fun.
You got a little defensive.

4633
03:10:18,971 --> 03:10:23,971
I thought were friends did listen.
I thought we were going to have some 

4634
03:10:24,971 --> 03:10:29,971
fun.
We were having fun and then toward the 

4635
03:10:29,971 --> 03:10:30,460
end of the conversation you asked me 
what does she do not care about.

4636
03:10:30,590 --> 03:10:32,860
I don't really care about the pod issue,
which I thought I cared about when I was

4637
03:10:32,861 --> 03:10:35,170
21.
You said you wouldn't defend issues when

4638
03:10:35,171 --> 03:10:37,030
you were from when you were seven,
seven years ago,

4639
03:10:37,031 --> 03:10:37,300
right?

4640
03:10:37,360 --> 03:10:39,310
All of your cells?
Every was 21.

4641
03:10:39,670 --> 03:10:41,410
I was probably a lot harsher on pot than
I am today.

4642
03:10:41,411 --> 03:10:43,270
I thought it was worse.
I grew up around it.

4643
03:10:43,300 --> 03:10:46,000
I had negative experiences and I didn't 
realize that was anecdotal.

4644
03:10:46,420 --> 03:10:51,420
I don't really care much anymore,
but I think state should be able to do 

4645
03:10:51,420 --> 03:10:51,420
what they want to do.
Then three,

4646
03:10:51,420 --> 03:10:52,960
four,
five follow up questions so we could get

4647
03:10:52,961 --> 03:10:55,900
to a point into this debate where the 
show is now going on two,

4648
03:10:55,910 --> 03:10:57,400
three hours long and I've missed my 
flight.

4649
03:10:57,430 --> 03:11:02,430
Well,
you were trying to say was that people 

4650
03:11:02,430 --> 03:11:04,150
that are pro marijuana ignore the 
negative consequences of marijuana,

4651
03:11:04,151 --> 03:11:07,510
and I asked you what those were and you 
said traffic fatalities,

4652
03:11:07,780 --> 03:11:12,780
one of them,
and then we tried to find out if that's 

4653
03:11:12,780 --> 03:11:13,420
true and we found out it's not going to 
find out that it's not true.

4654
03:11:13,450 --> 03:11:15,460
You made an argument that it's not true,
but we didn't.

4655
03:11:15,490 --> 03:11:18,310
We didn't definitively find out that 
it's not true statistics.

4656
03:11:18,760 --> 03:11:19,540
Well,
you just.

4657
03:11:19,570 --> 03:11:21,850
It's very easy to do that.
When you ignore opposing statistics.

4658
03:11:21,940 --> 03:11:24,240
Let's find the claims about them.
What's.

4659
03:11:24,250 --> 03:11:29,250
Let's have jamie miss my flight.
I'll have another hour to get plenty of 

4660
03:11:29,250 --> 03:11:29,740
time.
Man,

4661
03:11:29,741 --> 03:11:32,200
you're not going to get your flight.
You got a lot of time.

4662
03:11:34,540 --> 03:11:36,610
This is.
This is an interesting argument,

4663
03:11:36,670 --> 03:11:41,670
right?
It's an interesting argument because it 

4664
03:11:41,670 --> 03:11:43,090
shows what happens when people not 
necessarily disagree,

4665
03:11:43,300 --> 03:11:48,300
but getting new position where one 
person wants to have the upper hand and 

4666
03:11:48,300 --> 03:11:51,331
you keep jockeying back and forth.
We're trying to figure out who's going 

4667
03:11:51,331 --> 03:11:51,790
to wind up on the top of the heap.
No,

4668
03:11:51,970 --> 03:11:56,970
there's no jockeying back and forth.
Now you're the one jockeying back and 

4669
03:11:56,970 --> 03:11:56,970
fall,
sweetie.

4670
03:11:56,970 --> 03:11:58,830
Come on honey.
Come on with the bullying.

4671
03:11:58,860 --> 03:12:01,630
If that's a bully thing that we have a 
real problem in this country.

4672
03:12:01,631 --> 03:12:02,730
Pussy,
come on.

4673
03:12:02,740 --> 03:12:04,750
Fuck that money.
That might be dumb.

4674
03:12:04,751 --> 03:12:06,100
Fuck might be bullying.
Yeah,

4675
03:12:06,140 --> 03:12:11,140
sweetie is what you've done.
I did it as a joke because I thought 

4676
03:12:11,140 --> 03:12:11,140
were friends.
Oh,

4677
03:12:11,140 --> 03:12:12,550
you don't think where we talk every now 
and then I like,

4678
03:12:13,140 --> 03:12:15,580
I like you too,
but I immediately think we're friends.

4679
03:12:15,580 --> 03:12:17,110
You probably a pipe.
He gave me a pipe.

4680
03:12:17,111 --> 03:12:19,150
I think if you apply been on my podcast 
twice.

4681
03:12:19,210 --> 03:12:20,880
I know.
How dare pro.

4682
03:12:21,460 --> 03:12:23,330
Probably not invite her back.
You're a goddamn building.

4683
03:12:23,490 --> 03:12:24,910
Invite you back.
Listen,

4684
03:12:25,130 --> 03:12:27,040
here's the truth.
Are you upset more than me?

4685
03:12:28,210 --> 03:12:31,810
When you say you're defensive and you 
have somebody else to bring up sources,

4686
03:12:32,410 --> 03:12:34,510
that's let's be at really anything you 
want to.

4687
03:12:34,660 --> 03:12:36,160
No,
I don'T want you to look up and you want

4688
03:12:36,161 --> 03:12:37,120
me to.
Jamie will be.

4689
03:12:37,150 --> 03:12:42,150
Let me tell you something.
If jamie found something that shows me 

4690
03:12:42,150 --> 03:12:42,150
I'm wrong and he does all the time,
he pulls it up.

4691
03:12:42,150 --> 03:12:42,410
Well,
not gay.

4692
03:12:42,420 --> 03:12:43,930
Jarrod note that as a standing on our 
show,

4693
03:12:43,931 --> 03:12:46,480
we do it differently and that's why I 
invited you on the show.

4694
03:12:47,060 --> 03:12:50,230
How do you do it differently?
Titus comes in the show.

4695
03:12:50,260 --> 03:12:53,030
If sally cohen comes on the show,
if you come on the show and you say,

4696
03:12:53,090 --> 03:12:54,590
I want to talk about pot in the show.

4697
03:12:54,650 --> 03:12:56,180
If you say that and you say,
I disagree with you,

4698
03:12:56,510 --> 03:12:57,200
I said,
okay,

4699
03:12:57,590 --> 03:13:01,100
not [inaudible] not a word,
and you don't bring up any sources.

4700
03:13:01,340 --> 03:13:06,340
This is going to be.
Well this is the difference between you 

4701
03:13:06,340 --> 03:13:06,340
and me.
I'd let them talk about like you think I

4702
03:13:06,340 --> 03:13:07,580
would out jerry talks all the time,
but I don't think it's fair.

4703
03:13:07,880 --> 03:13:11,000
Why not?
I would talk to him to two on one and an

4704
03:13:11,001 --> 03:13:12,970
argument is fair on.
One is,

4705
03:13:13,020 --> 03:13:18,020
you know it's not and if he disagrees 
with me and you disagree with me 

4706
03:13:18,020 --> 03:13:18,020
together,
we can go back and forth all together.

4707
03:13:18,080 --> 03:13:20,540
I don'T care.
I don't mind if there's three people.

4708
03:13:20,541 --> 03:13:23,510
Get another friend that hates pot it.
I don't hate pot.

4709
03:13:23,540 --> 03:13:26,570
Well,
I mean just what absolutes.

4710
03:13:26,980 --> 03:13:30,680
Another hates pot.
I said,

4711
03:13:30,681 --> 03:13:32,570
ms dot characterizations and absolutes 
there.

4712
03:13:32,571 --> 03:13:34,190
I don't hate pot.
I'm not saying you do.

4713
03:13:34,190 --> 03:13:39,190
I'm saying get a friend who hates pot.
Bring get another friend who hates 

4714
03:13:39,190 --> 03:13:39,190
pocket another friend.
What is it?

4715
03:13:39,370 --> 03:13:41,480
Get another friend who also picked up 
another.

4716
03:13:42,300 --> 03:13:44,630
Jamie looked.
I should have used the word also.

4717
03:13:44,690 --> 03:13:46,580
No,
because the implication there is another

4718
03:13:46,581 --> 03:13:47,840
meaning.
You hate pot.

4719
03:13:47,870 --> 03:13:48,570
No,
I don't.

4720
03:13:48,610 --> 03:13:49,250
I said,
joe,

4721
03:13:49,251 --> 03:13:54,251
get another person.
You don't endorse bernie sanders and 

4722
03:13:54,251 --> 03:13:56,471
then had a thing on his face.
I think it would imply that the 

4723
03:13:56,471 --> 03:13:56,660
documents,
I think he losing argue the argument and

4724
03:13:56,661 --> 03:13:58,310
you continued for another hour.
Joe.

4725
03:13:58,450 --> 03:14:03,450
He didn't really.
He gave it to me with a caveat and the 

4726
03:14:03,450 --> 03:14:05,770
caveat is that I'm a bully and the jamie
pulls up statistics that only benefit on

4727
03:14:05,780 --> 03:14:06,500
that.
On that argument,

4728
03:14:06,501 --> 03:14:07,460
you are,
you are.

4729
03:14:08,330 --> 03:14:09,350
You are.
How my.

4730
03:14:09,380 --> 03:14:11,270
How is it a bully when two people are 
talking,

4731
03:14:11,480 --> 03:14:13,040
how's it builds?
Not two people talking.

4732
03:14:13,041 --> 03:14:18,041
No,
you don't have a conversation with two 

4733
03:14:18,041 --> 03:14:18,041
people talking.

4734
03:14:18,041 --> 03:14:20,050
You have a fail safe.
You have other people who agree with 

4735
03:14:20,050 --> 03:14:22,121
you.
You have an audience who agreeS with 

4736
03:14:22,121 --> 03:14:22,121
you.
I'm on your program talking to homies,

4737
03:14:22,121 --> 03:14:23,780
man.
Just two people talking.

4738
03:14:24,200 --> 03:14:26,690
Let me be clear.
I don't hate ponte.

4739
03:14:26,990 --> 03:14:31,990
Okay?
I couldn't care less if you want to 

4740
03:14:31,990 --> 03:14:31,990
smoke pot.
If states want to legalize pot.

4741
03:14:31,990 --> 03:14:34,130
Okay.
I couldn't care less about that now.

4742
03:14:34,280 --> 03:14:39,280
Okay.
Pod is not a substance without 

4743
03:14:39,280 --> 03:14:39,280
consequence.
That's all.

4744
03:14:39,280 --> 03:14:42,170
And some of those consequences can be 
damaged to developing brain when they're

4745
03:14:42,171 --> 03:14:47,171
25.
We have a psychiatrist on talk about it 

4746
03:14:47,171 --> 03:14:47,570
and people called her a dumb bitch who 
doesn't weed cures cancer.

4747
03:14:48,130 --> 03:14:53,130
Um,
there have been statistics and reports 

4748
03:14:53,130 --> 03:14:53,750
on fatalities increasing regarding 
marijuana.

4749
03:14:53,751 --> 03:14:57,050
You may not accept them and maybe you're
reading those sources.

4750
03:14:57,230 --> 03:14:59,450
Maybe your sources are more valid.
My sources.

4751
03:14:59,630 --> 03:15:03,440
I'll grant you that.
So my issue is when people are dishonest

4752
03:15:03,441 --> 03:15:08,360
and only present one side of the issue,
I just presented several sides and on my

4753
03:15:08,361 --> 03:15:10,430
show in a regular basis that,
listen,

4754
03:15:10,431 --> 03:15:12,170
if you want to smoke pot,
I couldn't care less.

4755
03:15:12,410 --> 03:15:17,410
Go ahead and smoke pot.
And I think that the people who have 

4756
03:15:17,410 --> 03:15:19,310
tried to make you think reefer madness 
and wild and wacky tobacky,

4757
03:15:19,311 --> 03:15:24,311
I think that's overblown.
But I also think there are some issues 

4758
03:15:24,311 --> 03:15:24,380
that people who simply want to justify 
it.

4759
03:15:24,470 --> 03:15:26,960
Sometimes a habit which could be 
negative to some people,

4760
03:15:26,990 --> 03:15:31,990
not all.
I'm overlooked completely one side of 

4761
03:15:31,990 --> 03:15:33,110
the issue and there is an entire side of
the medical community who disagrees with

4762
03:15:33,111 --> 03:15:35,360
you and I don't know that I agree with 
them or disagree with them.

4763
03:15:35,361 --> 03:15:40,361
Yet when I'm in the medical community,
there is entire side to the medical 

4764
03:15:40,361 --> 03:15:44,471
community who would disagree with your 
position and a position to know that I 

4765
03:15:44,471 --> 03:15:48,020
that that you think marijuana is a 
benign substance?

4766
03:15:48,140 --> 03:15:50,160
I don't think it's benign to developing

4767
03:15:50,160 --> 03:15:51,300
brains.
We already discussed that.

4768
03:15:51,330 --> 03:15:52,140
okay.
Good example.

4769
03:15:52,170 --> 03:15:53,250
Developing brains.
Why don't.

4770
03:15:53,251 --> 03:15:55,590
I don't think alcohol is a lot.
I think a lot of.

4771
03:15:55,740 --> 03:16:00,050
I would agree.
I think a lot of kids listen to you.

4772
03:16:00,060 --> 03:16:02,460
I know you're not responsible.
It's like you should be 18 years old,

4773
03:16:02,640 --> 03:16:04,530
18 and candidates should be 16 years old
to drive a car.

4774
03:16:04,531 --> 03:16:06,060
You're not telling kids to go and smoke 
up,

4775
03:16:06,390 --> 03:16:08,490
but I think a lot of people who are 
listening,

4776
03:16:08,550 --> 03:16:11,580
you have many young listeners who are in
that developmental stage.

4777
03:16:11,581 --> 03:16:15,950
Certainly under the age of 25 who only 
hear the positive virtues,

4778
03:16:16,270 --> 03:16:19,140
extolled the marijuana.
Sometimes they're not entirely honest.

4779
03:16:19,350 --> 03:16:21,600
Sometimes are not entirely accurate,
I should say.

4780
03:16:22,620 --> 03:16:24,810
I don't think that's necessarily a good 
thing necessarily.

4781
03:16:24,811 --> 03:16:28,240
Accurate.
How so a positive thing.

4782
03:16:28,590 --> 03:16:33,590
You talked about how harmful marijuana 
could be to the developing brain under 

4783
03:16:33,590 --> 03:16:34,890
two weeks.
So we have many times.

4784
03:16:34,920 --> 03:16:36,810
Have you in a way that you've conceded 
that's valid?

4785
03:16:36,840 --> 03:16:41,840
No,
we've said I don't tHink you should do 

4786
03:16:41,840 --> 03:16:43,281
anything when I don't think like any 15 
year old to do anything to their brand 

4787
03:16:43,281 --> 03:16:47,031
because we don't know what the fuck 
happens to your brain when you give a 

4788
03:16:47,031 --> 03:16:47,031
kid alcohol.
I did it.

4789
03:16:47,031 --> 03:16:47,780
I'm sure you probably did it too.
When was the.

4790
03:16:47,781 --> 03:16:49,730
When did you drink first?
How old were you?

4791
03:16:50,090 --> 03:16:55,090
probably like 51st beer.
I think I was 14 the first time I got 

4792
03:16:55,090 --> 03:16:55,920
drunk with my friends.
I mean it's terrible.

4793
03:16:55,921 --> 03:16:57,450
It's not good for you.
It's not smart.

4794
03:16:57,570 --> 03:16:59,670
It's definitely not smart and I know and
you know,

4795
03:16:59,671 --> 03:17:04,671
and I'm sure we all know someone who did
get completely overindulgent and 

4796
03:17:04,671 --> 03:17:09,311
marijuana and became one of those wake 
and bake people that ruined their lives 

4797
03:17:09,311 --> 03:17:11,160
and I think people can do that with 
almost any substance.

4798
03:17:11,190 --> 03:17:16,190
Anything that's psychoactive,
at least I think people do that with 

4799
03:17:16,190 --> 03:17:18,921
cigarettes where they.
They need that fucking cigarette more 

4800
03:17:18,921 --> 03:17:21,921
than they need anything.
I think a lot of aa people do that with 

4801
03:17:21,921 --> 03:17:24,891
cigarettes and alcohol.
They replaced their weird addiction to 

4802
03:17:24,891 --> 03:17:26,730
alcohol to something that's not as bad 
for them.

4803
03:17:26,790 --> 03:17:29,370
I think there's a lot of things for the 
developing mind,

4804
03:17:29,490 --> 03:17:34,490
particularly for the developing mind 
that we have available to us all the 

4805
03:17:34,490 --> 03:17:35,800
time that are really dangerous.
You know,

4806
03:17:35,810 --> 03:17:38,910
and Henry Rollins on here and was 
talking about when he was a little kid,

4807
03:17:38,911 --> 03:17:43,911
he was like five year olds.
They put him on ritalin at the time it 

4808
03:17:43,911 --> 03:17:44,100
was five.
I think that's fucking horrible.

4809
03:17:44,101 --> 03:17:46,890
I think psych meds for little kids that 
don't necessarily need them,

4810
03:17:46,891 --> 03:17:48,390
but maybe they're just a little too 
energetic.

4811
03:17:48,690 --> 03:17:53,690
I think all that shit's horrible.
So whether it's marijuana or alcohol or 

4812
03:17:53,690 --> 03:17:57,471
quaaludes or whatever you want to give a
15 year old kid that's got a developing 

4813
03:17:57,471 --> 03:17:59,400
mind,
I think there's massive consequences and

4814
03:17:59,401 --> 03:18:01,770
I don't think you can really calculate 
those consequences.

4815
03:18:01,920 --> 03:18:06,920
That's my position.
I think you can calculate those 

4816
03:18:06,920 --> 03:18:10,071
consequences and when I think you can,
but I mean you would have to fuck up a 

4817
03:18:10,071 --> 03:18:12,771
lot of kids in order to really prove the
viability of what damage is being done 

4818
03:18:12,771 --> 03:18:17,541
to kids.
And how much would cause the damage 

4819
03:18:17,541 --> 03:18:18,090
about ritalin.
Talking about quaaludes alcohol,

4820
03:18:18,091 --> 03:18:19,620
marijuana,
heroin,

4821
03:18:19,890 --> 03:18:21,630
preludes in 2017.
Wow.

4822
03:18:21,690 --> 03:18:24,180
Quail eludes oxies go.
Let's go with oxycontin's.

4823
03:18:24,181 --> 03:18:26,520
I'm just talking about downer.
So I'm talking about anything where it's

4824
03:18:26,521 --> 03:18:31,521
a depressant or stimulant.
There's significant amount of effects 

4825
03:18:31,521 --> 03:18:31,980
across the board.
Bitch quit by the way.

4826
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:33,540
I think it's just classified as a 
narcotic.

4827
03:18:34,070 --> 03:18:35,470
It's not like a downer,
like a,

4828
03:18:35,500 --> 03:18:39,510
like a benzodiazepine or something.
Aren't opiates considered a downer?

4829
03:18:40,740 --> 03:18:42,460
COnsidered barbiturates?
whether there.

4830
03:18:42,540 --> 03:18:44,730
I think there's it a depressant.
Alcohol is a depressant,

4831
03:18:44,731 --> 03:18:49,731
right?
Because the central nervous system 

4832
03:18:49,731 --> 03:18:49,731
depressant.
But I know something like

4833
03:18:49,731 --> 03:18:52,090
food or I'm actually knew a power lifter
were the only drug he could.

4834
03:18:52,120 --> 03:18:54,040
It was a prescriptive.
I don't remember this to date rape drug.

4835
03:18:54,340 --> 03:18:57,090
Was it prescribed drug?
A guy named Chad,

4836
03:18:57,120 --> 03:18:59,080
one of the date rape drugs.
Well,

4837
03:18:59,170 --> 03:19:00,730
whatever the most common date,
rape drug,

4838
03:19:00,731 --> 03:19:05,731
I don't know if it's,
I don't know if it's actually rueful in 

4839
03:19:05,731 --> 03:19:05,731
or whatever it's called.
Um,

4840
03:19:05,731 --> 03:19:06,760
but most commonly used or the most 
effective date rape drug.

4841
03:19:06,780 --> 03:19:08,880
I know what you're thinking about.
Um,

4842
03:19:08,920 --> 03:19:10,540
but I can't.
It's not coming to me.

4843
03:19:10,630 --> 03:19:11,650
I know the drug,
but it's,

4844
03:19:11,651 --> 03:19:14,950
it's a weird one where it helps 
bodybuilders sleep.

4845
03:19:16,070 --> 03:19:21,070
Power lifter and power lifters do it too
because it actually infers more 

4846
03:19:21,070 --> 03:19:21,460
developed growth hormone growth.
Well,

4847
03:19:21,520 --> 03:19:26,520
not just growth hormone,
but a recovery time because they have 

4848
03:19:26,520 --> 03:19:26,590
like deep sleep.
Fuck.

4849
03:19:26,591 --> 03:19:28,840
What is it called?
But you know wHat I'm talking about.

4850
03:19:28,840 --> 03:19:31,360
Is it used as a date rape?
Drug hypnosis is not ready to.

4851
03:19:31,450 --> 03:19:31,940
No,
not,

4852
03:19:31,950 --> 03:19:33,080
not.
That's released.

4853
03:19:33,120 --> 03:19:34,600
That's roofie.
So there's another thing.

4854
03:19:34,601 --> 03:19:36,310
I know what you're talking about.
It's usually the date rape drug.

4855
03:19:36,340 --> 03:19:38,980
Yes.
And there was a guy thing he could sleep

4856
03:19:38,981 --> 03:19:42,250
on and then It became so they don't 
prescribe it anymore.

4857
03:19:42,880 --> 03:19:44,270
He had insomnia.
He had like a kid,

4858
03:19:44,280 --> 03:19:49,280
like an 1100 squat was not quite world 
record but close to it and lived out in 

4859
03:19:49,571 --> 03:19:50,260
reno,
Nevada.

4860
03:19:50,320 --> 03:19:55,320
And uh,
that was the only way he could sleep 

4861
03:19:55,320 --> 03:19:55,320
when he wasn't able to get it anymore.
His lifts,

4862
03:19:55,320 --> 03:19:57,700
you find it fell or just tricks?
No,

4863
03:19:57,860 --> 03:19:59,030
no,
god,

4864
03:19:59,310 --> 03:20:01,360
it,
it's kinda like a real common name.

4865
03:20:01,510 --> 03:20:03,820
I'll text my buddy because he had an 
overdose of it,

4866
03:20:06,540 --> 03:20:09,550
but he was like 18.
Oh god.

4867
03:20:09,551 --> 03:20:12,790
Hold on a second.
Can you talk please for a moment while I

4868
03:20:12,800 --> 03:20:13,310
pull this?

4869
03:20:15,550 --> 03:20:18,070
That's it.
I'm a shoulder due tomorrow.

4870
03:20:18,071 --> 03:20:20,410
And where are you going to go back?
I'm a show tomorrow.

4871
03:20:20,590 --> 03:20:25,590
A tv show or radio show to do.
So there's no way we're going to get it 

4872
03:20:25,590 --> 03:20:29,461
done.
Us making up is gonna be so good For 

4873
03:20:29,461 --> 03:20:29,980
your show and my show to know it's not 
the entire commentary from this is going

4874
03:20:29,981 --> 03:20:30,610
to be,
oh my god.

4875
03:20:30,630 --> 03:20:33,400
What a moron.
Anything so we doesn't cute man.

4876
03:20:33,410 --> 03:20:35,220
We're going guarantee it.
I guarantee it,

4877
03:20:35,260 --> 03:20:36,760
don't be,
don't worry about it.

4878
03:20:36,790 --> 03:20:41,790
We're going to be,
we're gonna get through this and get 

4879
03:20:41,790 --> 03:20:43,351
through it in a way that makes sense.
I definitely get weird with these 

4880
03:20:45,071 --> 03:20:47,740
conversations and I assume everybody can
get,

4881
03:20:48,550 --> 03:20:50,950
you know,
fake hostile with me.

4882
03:20:50,951 --> 03:20:52,210
So if I call it,
come on bitch,

4883
03:20:52,420 --> 03:20:54,400
I talked to you like that.
I don't Mean it in a negative.

4884
03:20:54,401 --> 03:20:59,401
I do it like I would do it if you were 
brian cowen and he would start laughing 

4885
03:20:59,401 --> 03:20:59,401
along.

4886
03:20:59,401 --> 03:21:00,180
Yeah,
but you live in Michigan,

4887
03:21:00,190 --> 03:21:03,760
you get a little sensitive when you go.
That's adorable.

4888
03:21:03,770 --> 03:21:08,770
Let's listen on a second when you said 
that's not meant to and we were joking 

4889
03:21:08,770 --> 03:21:10,150
about their topics,
but on that you lasered in.

4890
03:21:10,151 --> 03:21:11,980
Got serious.
You're wrong.

4891
03:21:12,010 --> 03:21:14,610
Let's stay on this pounded in.
That's,

4892
03:21:14,660 --> 03:21:15,520
that's just,
it's,

4893
03:21:15,540 --> 03:21:17,110
it's,
it's just I don't understand the purpose

4894
03:21:17,111 --> 03:21:18,670
to.
It can have some fun.

4895
03:21:19,060 --> 03:21:20,390
So you're.
So that's fun.

4896
03:21:21,090 --> 03:21:22,870
Do you like doing that?
You like having,

4897
03:21:22,900 --> 03:21:24,610
you like having someone in disagreeing 
with him?

4898
03:21:24,790 --> 03:21:26,660
What happened?
Going into town?

4899
03:21:26,710 --> 03:21:29,290
Get a little silly like I think you 
might've got a little silly.

4900
03:21:29,320 --> 03:21:31,310
I like to have a little fun guy.
Little silly did I.

4901
03:21:31,440 --> 03:21:34,660
Did I bring up the punish you?
I said it's the issue.

4902
03:21:34,661 --> 03:21:37,000
I care about the least come home and I.
Let's get away from that.

4903
03:21:37,001 --> 03:21:38,050
We were were free.

4904
03:21:38,080 --> 03:21:40,630
Were out of the woods.
We're back on the road.

4905
03:21:40,631 --> 03:21:44,400
We're doing good.
You just want to grab the wheel back.

4906
03:21:44,770 --> 03:21:46,760
Turned towards the trees.
Don't do it.

4907
03:21:46,970 --> 03:21:50,360
Resist nitrile.
Hibiscus cold brew tea.

4908
03:21:50,480 --> 03:21:51,350
It's tea.
Yeah.

4909
03:21:51,830 --> 03:21:53,750
I had a hibiscus,
a beer recently.

4910
03:21:53,880 --> 03:21:56,420
Most disgusting they've ever had in my 
life and I love hibiscus tea.

4911
03:21:56,810 --> 03:21:58,250
Just does not work for beer.
I bet.

4912
03:21:58,251 --> 03:22:01,990
If you were in birkenstocks and you,
what if you had white dreadlocks,

4913
03:22:02,610 --> 03:22:05,540
you would have thought this is amazing.
Have you seen that kombucha beer,

4914
03:22:05,570 --> 03:22:07,570
beer?
You've actually had kombucha?

4915
03:22:07,620 --> 03:22:07,880
No.
No.

4916
03:22:07,910 --> 03:22:12,910
Kombucha beeR.
So that's like a kombucha that's like 

4917
03:22:12,910 --> 03:22:15,160
super strong or interesting.
I don't know how they do it because the 

4918
03:22:15,160 --> 03:22:17,450
alcohol with the active culture and 
kombucha should figuratively,

4919
03:22:17,690 --> 03:22:18,650
right?
There shouldn't be.

4920
03:22:18,651 --> 03:22:19,520
Alcohol.
Shouldn't have fIgured it.

4921
03:22:19,521 --> 03:22:21,770
They eat it as sugar because of the way 
kombucha ferments.

4922
03:22:21,860 --> 03:22:24,470
No,
not necessarily because gts can boot you

4923
03:22:24,471 --> 03:22:25,610
that you buy at whole foods.

4924
03:22:25,610 --> 03:22:30,610
You have to actually have an id to buy 
it because it's more than one half of 

4925
03:22:30,610 --> 03:22:34,571
one percent alcohol by volume,
so you have to show your id and be over 

4926
03:22:34,571 --> 03:22:36,350
21 in order to buy kombucha right.
Now that you say that,

4927
03:22:36,351 --> 03:22:39,320
I think I might have tried kombucha beer
once called.

4928
03:22:39,470 --> 03:22:44,470
Can I say the name or is it on good 
vibrations and there's one that's okay 

4929
03:22:44,470 --> 03:22:48,831
in one that literally tastes like vomit.
There's like a ginger one and there's 

4930
03:22:48,831 --> 03:22:52,751
like a bit and one of them I don't.
The problem is I don't remember which 

4931
03:22:52,751 --> 03:22:54,791
one.
So it's rolling the dice every time you 

4932
03:22:54,791 --> 03:22:56,771
have it.
See some people I just tell them about 

4933
03:22:56,771 --> 03:22:59,171
kombucha,
about the positive benefits of 

4934
03:22:59,171 --> 03:22:59,750
probiotics and like you should try it 
and you should eat Kimchi and you should

4935
03:22:59,751 --> 03:23:02,420
eat kraut.
Kiefer's great.

4936
03:23:02,600 --> 03:23:03,830
I had a my own culture.

4937
03:23:04,370 --> 03:23:05,320
Did you,
have you ever had a.

4938
03:23:05,360 --> 03:23:08,060
Have you ever done key for yourself,
but I did make kombucha myself.

4939
03:23:08,110 --> 03:23:09,610
I've done that before.
Kiefer's easier.

4940
03:23:10,020 --> 03:23:10,670
Relatable?
Yeah.

4941
03:23:10,671 --> 03:23:15,590
It looks like it looks like a slimy,
kind of like a c brain or cauliflower.

4942
03:23:15,870 --> 03:23:18,350
It's not like a grain originally.
TecHnically it's a grain,

4943
03:23:18,380 --> 03:23:20,960
but it's really just an active culture 
of bacteria and yeast,

4944
03:23:21,200 --> 03:23:23,780
so lIterally as opposed to yogurt with a
straining or kombucha,

4945
03:23:23,781 --> 03:23:25,490
which you literally just put it in a 
jar,

4946
03:23:25,910 --> 03:23:30,910
put it in on a countertop for a day and 
strain it and after I think about four 

4947
03:23:30,910 --> 03:23:33,410
or five batches,
it's doubled and then it quadruples it's

4948
03:23:33,411 --> 03:23:38,411
like an investment account and my wife 
killed it when I was on the road 

4949
03:23:38,411 --> 03:23:41,111
actually doing standup I was.
I had a few shows and I came back and 

4950
03:23:41,111 --> 03:23:43,990
you have to replace it every day.
Otherwise there's no sugar to feed it 

4951
03:23:43,990 --> 03:23:46,720
and came back and it looked like a snot 
rag and it was something that was the 

4952
03:23:46,720 --> 03:23:46,720
end of it and I just buy it at the 
store.

4953
03:23:46,720 --> 03:23:50,720
Kombucha has not really a fungus,
but it's somehow or another like a 

4954
03:23:50,720 --> 03:23:54,701
cousin of a fungus and people think it's
a fungus but it's a life form and when 

4955
03:23:54,701 --> 03:23:55,760
you get it,
like I had it at one point in time,

4956
03:23:55,761 --> 03:24:00,761
it was like the size of a laptop and I 
had this like big salad bowl and I was 

4957
03:24:00,761 --> 03:24:02,870
growing kombucha in my refrigerator and 
a salad bowl and the tea,

4958
03:24:02,960 --> 03:24:07,960
the whole top of the salad bowl was thIs
rubbery sort of life form if that disc 

4959
03:24:09,380 --> 03:24:14,380
pancake but it would get big.
It would get really big and then what I 

4960
03:24:14,380 --> 03:24:15,650
would do is I would drain it into a 
pitcher and I would put the picture into

4961
03:24:15,651 --> 03:24:20,651
the fridgerator and then I would put 
more of the sugar water and I forget 

4962
03:24:20,651 --> 03:24:25,121
what all the ingredients were,
but I know sugar was a part of it 

4963
03:24:25,121 --> 03:24:27,851
because the culture had to eat sugar in 
order to stay alive and then it would 

4964
03:24:28,160 --> 03:24:33,160
ferment and the fermentation was a part 
of it and then you would get like some 

4965
03:24:33,710 --> 03:24:35,420
sort of probiotic benefit from it.

4966
03:24:35,840 --> 03:24:38,740
That's a lot harder than keefer keefer 
you just pour the milk in,

4967
03:24:38,741 --> 03:24:41,000
the lactose is the sugar and that's it.
And it's done.

4968
03:24:41,180 --> 03:24:43,380
What's actually good about it too?
Um,

4969
03:24:43,530 --> 03:24:46,530
if you read the studies on it,
like two tablespoons of keifer,

4970
03:24:46,531 --> 03:24:51,531
like actual homemade kiefer is tens of 
billions of microorganisms as opposed to

4971
03:24:51,990 --> 03:24:52,950
yogurt.
Super good for You.

4972
03:24:53,340 --> 03:24:56,310
And it's higher in protein because if 
you do the math,

4973
03:24:56,311 --> 03:24:59,040
so you can still basically at that point
you're left without the lactose.

4974
03:24:59,100 --> 03:25:02,970
So You're left with really just the fat 
and the protein and all the b vitamins.

4975
03:25:02,971 --> 03:25:04,470
So it's like,
it's like they,

4976
03:25:04,560 --> 03:25:07,170
I read an article once could not 
corroborate this,

4977
03:25:07,440 --> 03:25:10,980
but they said that goat's milk,
whole goat's milk keifer.

4978
03:25:11,280 --> 03:25:14,640
If you could only have one,
food would be the most complete food you

4979
03:25:14,641 --> 03:25:15,360
could have.
Wow.

4980
03:25:15,780 --> 03:25:18,880
But what about all your vitamins that 
you would get like fido nutrients?

4981
03:25:19,310 --> 03:25:24,310
Ideal.
It's not ideal to see if you'd only do 

4982
03:25:24,310 --> 03:25:24,310
one because you get the b vitamins,
you get vitamin d,

4983
03:25:24,310 --> 03:25:25,890
vitamin k,
um,

4984
03:25:26,550 --> 03:25:27,720
and that's whatever they said.

4985
03:25:27,720 --> 03:25:32,720
If you could only have one.
And then there was an article that if 

4986
03:25:32,720 --> 03:25:32,720
you could only have two,
you'd be like that.

4987
03:25:32,720 --> 03:25:37,340
And egg yolks.
Have you ever fucked with like some of 

4988
03:25:37,340 --> 03:25:39,540
those pharmaceutical grade probiotics?
Like what was rhonda?

4989
03:25:39,541 --> 03:25:41,680
Patrick was talking about?
Those ones on the podcast.

4990
03:25:41,681 --> 03:25:43,740
She was talking about some stuff.
You have to refrigerate it,

4991
03:25:43,741 --> 03:25:45,270
you buy it as like super.
Oh yeah,

4992
03:25:45,271 --> 03:25:45,860
I have.
Yeah,

4993
03:25:45,870 --> 03:25:46,650
I have,
have you.

4994
03:25:46,770 --> 03:25:47,130
Well,
you know,

4995
03:25:47,190 --> 03:25:52,190
my,
my producer not get shared had 

4996
03:25:52,190 --> 03:25:52,190
ulcerative colitis,
so he has no.

4997
03:25:52,190 --> 03:25:56,360
Oh jesus christ.
So he's going to our office bathroom 

4998
03:25:56,360 --> 03:25:56,360
four or five times a day.
Oh,

4999
03:25:56,360 --> 03:26:00,591
the poor guy.
And I had a problem one time where I 

5000
03:26:00,591 --> 03:26:00,591
just,
I was so stressed and know,

5001
03:26:00,591 --> 03:26:02,230
have all these nerve endings where my 
stomach just,

5002
03:26:02,250 --> 03:26:07,250
I felt like I thought oh no,
all sort of colitis was getting tested 

5003
03:26:07,250 --> 03:26:07,250
for it and just turned out it was 
stress.

5004
03:26:07,250 --> 03:26:10,170
And uh,
they put me on these probiotics and it,

5005
03:26:10,190 --> 03:26:15,190
it didn't really work.
And then when I did the kiefer at that 

5006
03:26:15,190 --> 03:26:19,761
actually helped a lot more.
Wouldn't it be ironic if marijuana was 

5007
03:26:19,761 --> 03:26:22,341
really the cure,
the unity of the entire time that you 

5008
03:26:22,341 --> 03:26:22,341
probably would have helped because it 
would have eased the anxiety?

5009
03:26:22,341 --> 03:26:23,520
I bet you it would have been.
Might have played.

5010
03:26:23,521 --> 03:26:26,030
It also might've made you more anxious 
because it makes people.

5011
03:26:26,090 --> 03:26:27,580
That's one thing you want to talk about 
the.

5012
03:26:27,630 --> 03:26:32,630
Here's the negative.
I'll give you one side of the negative 

5013
03:26:32,630 --> 03:26:35,300
that people ignore is the paranoia that 
marijuana can do it 100 percent.

5014
03:26:35,731 --> 03:26:38,430
Gives yOu paranoid.
I have had some friends that were deep,

5015
03:26:38,431 --> 03:26:41,820
deep potheads that one fucking cold 
Turkey and don't want to go back.

5016
03:26:41,821 --> 03:26:43,800
It's like a monster that's in their 
closet,

5017
03:26:44,020 --> 03:26:45,420
has written a waiting to get them.

5018
03:26:45,420 --> 03:26:46,950
When they go to pick out their socks,
there's.

5019
03:26:46,990 --> 03:26:51,990
There's no doubt about it.
It has this one effect on some people,

5020
03:26:52,171 --> 03:26:57,171
particularly if you take too much of it 
or if your life is getting away from 

5021
03:26:57,171 --> 03:26:57,171
you,
you know,

5022
03:26:57,171 --> 03:27:02,120
if it's like slipping away from you and 
then you start wake and bacon and then 

5023
03:27:02,120 --> 03:27:02,730
you just don't ever deal with all your 
issues,

5024
03:27:02,731 --> 03:27:07,731
so they compound and fucking whirlwind.
I was told daniel of bullshit by my 

5025
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:08,460
shrink.
SHe say,

5026
03:27:08,470 --> 03:27:11,080
you probably have you done this gene 
site testing now.

5027
03:27:11,081 --> 03:27:12,630
What's that?
Really haven't done it.

5028
03:27:12,690 --> 03:27:13,710
No surprise.
So,

5029
03:27:13,711 --> 03:27:15,510
um,
it's mainly used in psychiatry now,

5030
03:27:15,511 --> 03:27:20,511
but they're saying it's gonna have all 
kinds of future with determining cancer 

5031
03:27:20,511 --> 03:27:23,271
and things like that.
And they actually use it to look for 

5032
03:27:23,271 --> 03:27:23,271
depression,
bipolar,

5033
03:27:23,271 --> 03:27:24,570
adhd,
and they can look at your genes.

5034
03:27:24,750 --> 03:27:25,530
Now,
I'm not a doctor,

5035
03:27:25,560 --> 03:27:26,220
I'm going to butcher this.

5036
03:27:26,220 --> 03:27:28,710
But basically for me,
um,

5037
03:27:28,770 --> 03:27:30,220
they can look at your dopamine and say,
this is,

5038
03:27:30,221 --> 03:27:32,650
this is how your genetics work.
And basically if you go,

5039
03:27:33,150 --> 03:27:34,830
I don't know if they can tell if you're 
gay,

5040
03:27:34,831 --> 03:27:39,831
but they already have accepted it.
I actually have a video called you 

5041
03:27:39,831 --> 03:27:43,671
choose to be gay.
And my answer is definitively know what 

5042
03:27:43,671 --> 03:27:43,671
if it was you?
Well,

5043
03:27:44,020 --> 03:27:49,020
again,
because I don't choose a pretty much 

5044
03:27:49,020 --> 03:27:49,270
knew when I tuned into the,
when I was a kid and I was looking at me

5045
03:27:49,271 --> 03:27:52,090
shit and rachel bilson and the people 
who wanted to screw adam brody,

5046
03:27:52,420 --> 03:27:53,770
I think that's when you realize you're 
gay.

5047
03:27:55,030 --> 03:27:56,490
If it were me than it'd be gay.
Okay.

5048
03:27:56,980 --> 03:27:58,360
What does that matter?
Just question.

5049
03:27:58,540 --> 03:28:03,540
Would you be uncomfortable if I know 
I've had myeloma in the show because 

5050
03:28:03,540 --> 03:28:03,850
I've talked quite a bit.
Thank you.

5051
03:28:03,851 --> 03:28:05,080
That you could look and say,
well,

5052
03:28:05,081 --> 03:28:05,800
maybe he's gay.

5053
03:28:06,070 --> 03:28:08,020
Maybe an ulterior motives.
I don't think I would think,

5054
03:28:09,070 --> 03:28:10,630
but with dopamine for,
with me,

5055
03:28:10,631 --> 03:28:12,920
like we have a relative in the family 
who actually um,

5056
03:28:13,330 --> 03:28:18,330
well I should say who has an issue?
And so they looked at genes that create 

5057
03:28:18,330 --> 03:28:18,330
serotonin and then okay,
you have a long.

5058
03:28:18,340 --> 03:28:21,220
Most people have a long a short gene and
you have to short jeans.

5059
03:28:21,250 --> 03:28:22,600
And with me,
that's the case with dopamine.

5060
03:28:22,630 --> 03:28:26,710
So like a lot of people who would maybe 
typically be addicts or people with adhd

5061
03:28:26,711 --> 03:28:27,970
are people who,
um,

5062
03:28:28,030 --> 03:28:29,680
for me,
I didn't realize this until it was a lot

5063
03:28:29,681 --> 03:28:30,790
older.
Look,

5064
03:28:30,850 --> 03:28:35,850
this is,
I'm going to totally exposed myself as 

5065
03:28:35,850 --> 03:28:35,850
vulnerable to all the angry potheads 
after the argument.

5066
03:28:35,850 --> 03:28:39,460
I didn't realize until I was older,
I didn't actually feel the same feelings

5067
03:28:39,461 --> 03:28:41,310
of joy for like pleasure that other 
people don't.

5068
03:28:41,950 --> 03:28:43,000
So delving right.

5069
03:28:43,000 --> 03:28:44,260
You know how that works,
it's your reward center,

5070
03:28:44,261 --> 03:28:46,270
like you do something good bang.
And uh,

5071
03:28:46,271 --> 03:28:50,320
I was a b student in high school.
I never opened a textbook a because if I

5072
03:28:50,321 --> 03:28:53,050
completed something,
I did a project that was it bumpy.

5073
03:28:53,070 --> 03:28:54,920
LIke I did a project spectrum.
Okay.

5074
03:28:55,050 --> 03:28:56,050
I did a product.
What's the next thing?

5075
03:28:56,051 --> 03:28:58,630
I never really felt that reward center 
in the brain.

5076
03:28:59,200 --> 03:29:02,320
And they did this gene site testing and 
they found that basically have the worst

5077
03:29:02,350 --> 03:29:04,450
genetic pattern.
It's not entirely accurate,

5078
03:29:04,780 --> 03:29:08,380
but it's actually increased the efficacy
of antidepressants from like a one in a,

5079
03:29:08,381 --> 03:29:12,640
one in two to like a two and three,
something like that.

5080
03:29:12,840 --> 03:29:17,840
um,
because they can look in and look at 

5081
03:29:17,840 --> 03:29:17,840
your genetics more effectively.
And so,

5082
03:29:17,840 --> 03:29:18,580
no,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

5083
03:29:18,581 --> 03:29:22,480
but are you,
have you taken anti depressants?

5084
03:29:22,860 --> 03:29:27,860
Uh,
I've taken adhd medication that's on 

5085
03:29:27,860 --> 03:29:27,860
antidepressants,
antidepressants,

5086
03:29:27,860 --> 03:29:28,210
but it's easy to.

5087
03:29:28,220 --> 03:29:30,670
Activity disorder is a completely 
different situation,

5088
03:29:31,150 --> 03:29:34,900
but it's also basically a dopamine 
shortage in adhd is.

5089
03:29:35,310 --> 03:29:40,310
And wow,
that's why stimulants on people who 

5090
03:29:40,310 --> 03:29:41,080
actually have adhd don't rev them up.
Actually the zone I'm in,

5091
03:29:41,081 --> 03:29:46,081
you know,
some studying and they feel like wired 

5092
03:29:46,081 --> 03:29:46,720
and uh,
before there's nick testing,

5093
03:29:46,730 --> 03:29:48,520
that's how they often tested for it as 
well.

5094
03:29:48,521 --> 03:29:51,460
How do you react to this drug and if you
feel wired,

5095
03:29:51,730 --> 03:29:52,330
like,
you know,

5096
03:29:52,331 --> 03:29:54,820
meet with all this.
I had 600 milligrams of caffeine.

5097
03:29:55,490 --> 03:29:57,340
Um,
then you probably don't have adhd.

5098
03:29:57,370 --> 03:30:01,320
What kind of shit that they put you on 
when they put you on adhd medication and

5099
03:30:01,321 --> 03:30:02,050
the base of like,
adderall,

5100
03:30:02,051 --> 03:30:02,820
stuff like that.
Oh,

5101
03:30:02,821 --> 03:30:04,170
so theY put you on adderall?
I've,

5102
03:30:04,230 --> 03:30:05,230
yeah,
I've taken it and I don't,

5103
03:30:05,231 --> 03:30:10,231
I don't take it every day because I 
never want to be dependent on how often 

5104
03:30:10,231 --> 03:30:10,231
you take it.

5105
03:30:10,231 --> 03:30:10,580
Uh,
I don't know.

5106
03:30:10,660 --> 03:30:11,810
Couple of times a week.
yeah,

5107
03:30:11,890 --> 03:30:12,850
probably.
Yeah.

5108
03:30:12,910 --> 03:30:15,790
You just hIt it when you feel down like 
I take it is amazing.

5109
03:30:15,791 --> 03:30:18,550
I will tell you this,
I never realized until I took it,

5110
03:30:18,551 --> 03:30:20,980
and this is not an advocate because I 
think it's way over prescribed.

5111
03:30:21,100 --> 03:30:23,130
I think you're right.
I think most kids who are,

5112
03:30:23,200 --> 03:30:25,060
I don't think you should put kids on it.
I think you're right.

5113
03:30:25,750 --> 03:30:29,170
and I think that most kids or most 
people who take it don't need it,

5114
03:30:29,560 --> 03:30:34,560
but I also think that there are people 
with real conditions out there like you 

5115
03:30:34,560 --> 03:30:34,560
that can benefit from it.
Well,

5116
03:30:34,560 --> 03:30:38,641
you have a genetic.
Well we can prove it well because for 

5117
03:30:38,641 --> 03:30:38,650
the longest time my wife will hear this 
and she'll,

5118
03:30:38,710 --> 03:30:41,540
I,
I'm denied it through and through.

5119
03:30:41,541 --> 03:30:42,410
I thought,
no,

5120
03:30:42,411 --> 03:30:42,950
you know,
there's,

5121
03:30:42,951 --> 03:30:44,510
this is just,
this is bullshit.

5122
03:30:44,510 --> 03:30:46,550
The adhd is just to get kids whacked out
on ritalin.

5123
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:47,870
And uh,
I,

5124
03:30:47,871 --> 03:30:49,220
you know,
I had people that I would deal with like

5125
03:30:49,221 --> 03:30:54,221
counseling or stuff.
Here's the kicker that would get 

5126
03:30:54,221 --> 03:30:55,721
stressed.
I had stress management issues and a 

5127
03:30:55,721 --> 03:30:55,721
thought about adhd.
I'm like,

5128
03:30:55,721 --> 03:30:55,721
no,
no,

5129
03:30:55,721 --> 03:30:56,870
I don't believe it.
And then,

5130
03:30:56,930 --> 03:31:01,670
um,
I was given a book on adhd and I never,

5131
03:31:01,700 --> 03:31:06,700
I've never finished reading.
It was like three pages and moved onto 

5132
03:31:06,700 --> 03:31:06,700
something else.
And they said,

5133
03:31:06,700 --> 03:31:07,270
okay,
um,

5134
03:31:07,310 --> 03:31:09,650
let's do this test,
this whole kind of questionnaire deal.

5135
03:31:09,651 --> 03:31:11,270
And it was pretty extensive,
you know,

5136
03:31:11,300 --> 03:31:13,280
short of actually doing a cat scan.
So,

5137
03:31:13,281 --> 03:31:18,281
okay,
you test like in the top 99th 

5138
03:31:18,281 --> 03:31:18,281
percentile.
And we did the gene site testing,

5139
03:31:18,281 --> 03:31:20,270
I think it's called gene site,
and um,

5140
03:31:20,730 --> 03:31:23,270
it was pretty remarkable and I will say 
that,

5141
03:31:23,271 --> 03:31:25,130
uh,
I won't get into exactly what it is that

5142
03:31:25,131 --> 03:31:26,990
I've done or what medications I've 
taken,

5143
03:31:26,991 --> 03:31:31,991
but it was certainly life changing as 
far as I didn't know what normal people 

5144
03:31:31,991 --> 03:31:31,991
felt like,
wow,

5145
03:31:31,991 --> 03:31:32,210
that's really fast.

5146
03:31:32,210 --> 03:31:37,210
And adhd is a fascinating form of a sort
of a mild mental disorder that's 

5147
03:31:38,241 --> 03:31:43,241
extremely frequent.
I don't think it's as frequent as a lot 

5148
03:31:43,241 --> 03:31:44,140
of people think that I would give you.
I think it's overprescribed.

5149
03:31:44,390 --> 03:31:46,790
I really do.
I really do because whenever I say it,

5150
03:31:46,940 --> 03:31:47,480
you know,
people go,

5151
03:31:47,660 --> 03:31:48,290
oh,
I to,

5152
03:31:48,291 --> 03:31:49,220
I made your add.
I go,

5153
03:31:49,250 --> 03:31:49,560
no,
no,

5154
03:31:50,080 --> 03:31:51,470
it's not the same thing.
Right.

5155
03:31:51,471 --> 03:31:52,950
That's the thing that people like to say
to,

5156
03:31:52,951 --> 03:31:54,880
does compensate for them being a 
douchebag.

5157
03:31:54,930 --> 03:31:55,960
Asperger's.
Um,

5158
03:31:56,050 --> 03:32:01,050
so I'm on the spectrum spectrum,
so,

5159
03:32:02,221 --> 03:32:04,940
but it is,
I came into it kicking and screaming and

5160
03:32:04,950 --> 03:32:07,730
uh,
I mean I never did any in school.

5161
03:32:07,731 --> 03:32:10,070
I Just did the bare minimum was so 
boring,

5162
03:32:10,910 --> 03:32:15,910
so boring.
And then when they sort of do an actual 

5163
03:32:15,910 --> 03:32:17,440
test iq testing and stuff,
and we found it like,

5164
03:32:17,450 --> 03:32:19,940
well listen,
medication doesn't make you smarter.

5165
03:32:20,400 --> 03:32:21,590
Right?
I have my own

5166
03:32:21,700 --> 03:32:26,700
theories about this whole thing that 
they do when they take kids and they 

5167
03:32:26,700 --> 03:32:30,640
make them all sit in the same school,
in the same class and listen to the same

5168
03:32:30,641 --> 03:32:31,450
subject.
Right?

5169
03:32:31,600 --> 03:32:36,600
I don't think there's anything in life 
that mirrors that and I think 

5170
03:32:36,600 --> 03:32:40,021
experiences in life very radically and I
think that if you looked at nature and 

5171
03:32:40,021 --> 03:32:44,101
the great spectrum of survivors and 
winners and losers and how genes get 

5172
03:32:44,621 --> 03:32:48,280
expressed and how evolution takes place 
in nature.

5173
03:32:48,350 --> 03:32:53,350
Yeah,
there's all sorts of different kinds of 

5174
03:32:53,350 --> 03:32:53,530
animals.
Why wouldn't we assume there's all sorts

5175
03:32:53,531 --> 03:32:58,531
of different kinds of people.
Whenever you force all people to sit 

5176
03:32:58,531 --> 03:32:59,510
down and do the same thing,
you're going to have aberrations.

5177
03:32:59,511 --> 03:33:04,511
You gonna have people that don't like.
Obviously you've found something with 

5178
03:33:04,511 --> 03:33:06,570
your show and with public speaking that 
you excel at,

5179
03:33:06,670 --> 03:33:10,150
like you've found this thing like this 
renting thing that you could do.

5180
03:33:10,151 --> 03:33:14,170
We could just go on 100 words a second 
about all these different things,

5181
03:33:14,340 --> 03:33:19,340
like you've found this thing where 
whatever way your brain works,

5182
03:33:19,750 --> 03:33:24,750
it works perfectly for that.
It's the same thing with a standup 

5183
03:33:24,750 --> 03:33:25,420
comedian and same thing with a musician,
an author.

5184
03:33:25,450 --> 03:33:27,280
There's a lot of people that daydream 
all the time like,

5185
03:33:27,281 --> 03:33:28,180
oh,
you're a fucking loser.

5186
03:33:28,181 --> 03:33:30,400
No,
this guy's writing books and his fucking

5187
03:33:30,401 --> 03:33:32,230
head.
Just give me a god damn laptop,

5188
03:33:32,231 --> 03:33:34,270
but he's going to make a million bucks.
You know what I mean?

5189
03:33:34,271 --> 03:33:34,710
It's like,
well,

5190
03:33:34,770 --> 03:33:39,770
I mean,
and the truth is people they want to 

5191
03:33:39,770 --> 03:33:41,890
know.
You probably talked about this with 

5192
03:33:41,890 --> 03:33:41,890
christina hoff summers actually.
There are people who have a lot of those

5193
03:33:41,890 --> 03:33:43,830
kinds of interactions that you talked 
about in the classroom on a daily basis.

5194
03:33:43,860 --> 03:33:46,800
They're called Women.
They sit down and talk.

5195
03:33:46,830 --> 03:33:48,690
Think about women.
They get together with a book group,

5196
03:33:48,691 --> 03:33:53,691
whatever it is.
They literally sit down and listen and 

5197
03:33:53,691 --> 03:33:56,580
to listen to someone and that's it,
and they'll sit because they're very 

5198
03:33:56,580 --> 03:33:59,781
auditory.
That's the way they learned the public 

5199
03:33:59,781 --> 03:34:01,311
education system In the United States 
was designed for girls from the ground 

5200
03:34:01,311 --> 03:34:02,340
up and you put boys into a world where 
they don't do well.

5201
03:34:02,490 --> 03:34:07,490
They do not thrive in that atmosphere of
what girls do and that's why girls have 

5202
03:34:07,490 --> 03:34:08,430
much higher grades in high school going 
into college.

5203
03:34:08,670 --> 03:34:10,110
and then when boys can study at their 
own pace,

5204
03:34:10,111 --> 03:34:11,340
they do better on the sats.

5205
03:34:12,260 --> 03:34:13,860
There's actually a great book called out
wild at heart,

5206
03:34:13,861 --> 03:34:15,660
I think by john eldridge that talks 
about that.

5207
03:34:15,661 --> 03:34:20,661
And this was a long time ago talking 
about then rather we know boys learn 

5208
03:34:20,661 --> 03:34:20,661
better with their hands.
Think about it,

5209
03:34:20,661 --> 03:34:25,161
right?
It's considered a masculine jim shop or 

5210
03:34:25,161 --> 03:34:28,550
not just masculine things,
but physical science where you're 

5211
03:34:28,550 --> 03:34:31,251
working in a laboratory.
Those are subjects where boys actually 

5212
03:34:31,251 --> 03:34:34,221
tend to do better than girls often in 
high school or they rated as something 

5213
03:34:34,221 --> 03:34:37,761
they like.
Instead of changing the way we do male 

5214
03:34:37,761 --> 03:34:38,040
education,
we try and change little boys and that's

5215
03:34:38,041 --> 03:34:39,420
a real,
that's a real problem.

5216
03:34:39,510 --> 03:34:40,980
And uh,
I think that's a big reason,

5217
03:34:40,981 --> 03:34:43,440
not because someone was bullied because 
someone used the word fag.

5218
03:34:43,680 --> 03:34:46,620
I think you probably have a lot of 
incidents of depression in young boys in

5219
03:34:46,621 --> 03:34:51,621
particular because you're putting them 
in an atmosphere where they can't 

5220
03:34:51,621 --> 03:34:51,621
possibly succeed.

5221
03:34:51,621 --> 03:34:52,920
Yeah.
Well I think both are problematic,

5222
03:34:52,921 --> 03:34:57,921
but I think the square peg round hole 
issue has been there for the beginning 

5223
03:34:57,921 --> 03:34:57,921
of school in the first place.
I mean,

5224
03:34:58,600 --> 03:35:01,470
I don't mean to be like a proponent of 
homeschooling,

5225
03:35:01,680 --> 03:35:03,760
but really every.
I mean,

5226
03:35:03,780 --> 03:35:08,780
once you have kids,
I think you kind of realized that god 

5227
03:35:08,780 --> 03:35:09,180
damn every kid out of the box is a 
totally different thing.

5228
03:35:09,360 --> 03:35:10,560
They're just different,
you know,

5229
03:35:10,561 --> 03:35:15,561
we're gonna homeschool because my wife,
she went to montessori school and she 

5230
03:35:15,561 --> 03:35:17,400
went to a public high school or a 
private high school.

5231
03:35:17,850 --> 03:35:18,810
Um,
but she's,

5232
03:35:18,840 --> 03:35:19,620
she's,
she basically,

5233
03:35:19,621 --> 03:35:20,670
she's a genius.
She's very,

5234
03:35:20,671 --> 03:35:25,671
very smart.
But she did not do well in a normal 

5235
03:35:25,671 --> 03:35:25,671
school at all,
at all.

5236
03:35:25,671 --> 03:35:30,080
Do you think you could find a school 
that maybe is more flexible or because 

5237
03:35:30,080 --> 03:35:33,940
of the montessori school?
Socializing is critical for kids and 

5238
03:35:33,940 --> 03:35:36,480
socializing during the day where they 
learn about each other,

5239
03:35:36,720 --> 03:35:41,720
you know,
they learned about interactions and you 

5240
03:35:41,720 --> 03:35:41,720
can talk to them too.

5241
03:35:41,720 --> 03:35:41,720
They come home,
you know,

5242
03:35:41,720 --> 03:35:42,510
uh,
debbie said something mean to me,

5243
03:35:42,511 --> 03:35:45,510
what did she say?
And I think that's important.

5244
03:35:45,540 --> 03:35:48,030
I can tell you kind of a tale of two 
homeschooled kids.

5245
03:35:48,070 --> 03:35:53,070
I've,
I won't give any names here because 

5246
03:35:53,070 --> 03:35:53,070
they'll know who they are.
Family,

5247
03:35:53,070 --> 03:35:54,720
they have a homeschool kids.
Very weird.

5248
03:35:55,560 --> 03:36:00,030
I'm just stare at their screen all day.
I have another family,

5249
03:36:00,031 --> 03:36:01,830
friends who were homeschooled.
Their kids,

5250
03:36:01,890 --> 03:36:06,890
they're the best kids you could possibly
have in an adult dinner table because 

5251
03:36:06,890 --> 03:36:08,400
they put the kids in jujitsu.
I tHink one of them does tennis.

5252
03:36:08,640 --> 03:36:10,500
They put kids in all kinds of social 
activities.

5253
03:36:10,560 --> 03:36:15,560
They travel with the kids,
they take them to europe and then 

5254
03:36:15,560 --> 03:36:16,590
whenever they have adult get togethers 
where it's appropriate for kids to be,

5255
03:36:16,591 --> 03:36:18,030
they still have adult night and date 
night.

5256
03:36:18,750 --> 03:36:21,930
Kids can be there and they'll speak when
asked to speak.

5257
03:36:21,960 --> 03:36:24,120
They don't interrupt.
They're able to interact with adults.

5258
03:36:24,121 --> 03:36:28,230
They're probably the most well adjusted 
kids I've ever seen and then I have seen

5259
03:36:28,231 --> 03:36:29,400
the weird,
creepy,

5260
03:36:29,401 --> 03:36:34,401
homeschooled kids where you do your 
class on your ipad and then afterwards 

5261
03:36:34,401 --> 03:36:34,530
you get to watch pewdie pie,
you know,

5262
03:36:34,531 --> 03:36:36,840
play video or whatever it is.
Um,

5263
03:36:37,090 --> 03:36:38,410
so it really does come down to the 
parents,

5264
03:36:38,411 --> 03:36:40,900
but I do think that a parent who knows 
how to homeschool kid,

5265
03:36:41,350 --> 03:36:46,350
I think that's going to be a,
especially if the mom is at home with 

5266
03:36:46,350 --> 03:36:46,350
the kids,
you know,

5267
03:36:46,350 --> 03:36:46,690
um,
I think it's a huge leg up for this.

5268
03:36:46,691 --> 03:36:51,691
Obviously so many variables as far as 
the intellect of the parents and what 

5269
03:36:51,691 --> 03:36:56,071
their thought processes behind 
homeschooling their kid and what their 

5270
03:36:56,071 --> 03:37:00,271
experience level is and how much thought
they put into it and where they're 

5271
03:37:00,271 --> 03:37:01,120
coming from emotionally,
psychologically,

5272
03:37:01,121 --> 03:37:02,440
intellectually.
Yeah.

5273
03:37:02,440 --> 03:37:03,610
There's a lot of variables.
I mean,

5274
03:37:03,611 --> 03:37:05,890
the idea of homeschooling is bad or 
homeschooling is good.

5275
03:37:06,280 --> 03:37:08,650
I have a friends that have hold 
homeschooled,

5276
03:37:08,651 --> 03:37:10,060
three of their kids.
They have four kids.

5277
03:37:10,061 --> 03:37:11,800
They homeschool three of them.
The kids are fine,

5278
03:37:12,370 --> 03:37:14,260
they're fine.
They put a lot of work into it.

5279
03:37:14,290 --> 03:37:15,610
They spend a lot of time with their 
kids.

5280
03:37:15,611 --> 03:37:20,611
They took their kids all over the world.
They took their kids traveling all 

5281
03:37:20,611 --> 03:37:20,611
through europe,
you know,

5282
03:37:20,611 --> 03:37:22,510
they just decided at some point in time 
and it wasn't always homeschool.

5283
03:37:22,520 --> 03:37:27,520
They had done some public school,
they had done some private school and 

5284
03:37:27,520 --> 03:37:28,780
then they got to a point they were like,
look like what are we,

5285
03:37:28,840 --> 03:37:30,860
what are we doing here?
We're tryIng to teach.

5286
03:37:31,150 --> 03:37:36,150
The kids got older into their like 
preteens and then their teens and then 

5287
03:37:36,150 --> 03:37:40,171
they came to this conclusion like what?
What they are coming back from high 

5288
03:37:40,171 --> 03:37:44,181
school with and from middle school with 
is not what I want them to be exposed 

5289
03:37:45,080 --> 03:37:45,310
to.

5290
03:37:45,530 --> 03:37:48,460
Rather I want to be exposed to the 
classics.

5291
03:37:48,461 --> 03:37:53,461
I want them to be exposed to life and 
let just looking at human beings in a 

5292
03:37:53,461 --> 03:37:57,211
way that's like open minded and 
traveling and seeing things and so 

5293
03:37:57,211 --> 03:37:58,780
instead of like necessarily just having 
them take spanish.

5294
03:37:58,781 --> 03:38:01,570
They lived in Spain for a little while.
They went to Spain and lived there.

5295
03:38:01,890 --> 03:38:04,120
So they think of interesting,
crazy age.

5296
03:38:04,121 --> 03:38:05,310
and you were talking about tucker 
carlson.

5297
03:38:05,340 --> 03:38:10,340
She's a middle school teacher.
THink of the enclaves of crazy places 

5298
03:38:10,340 --> 03:38:12,250
for these social justice warriors go and
often they go into teaching because it's

5299
03:38:12,251 --> 03:38:14,200
their way to get power of these little 
kids.

5300
03:38:14,370 --> 03:38:19,370
And here's the thing that was really.
We wrote about that on the website and 

5301
03:38:19,370 --> 03:38:19,370
what I wrote about that.
Does that interview?

5302
03:38:19,370 --> 03:38:20,530
Yeah,
whatever it about that was.

5303
03:38:21,350 --> 03:38:23,860
This is a horrible interview because 
she's okay with violence in berkeley,

5304
03:38:24,640 --> 03:38:29,640
but what really disturbs me is every 
other professor out there who isn't a 

5305
03:38:29,640 --> 03:38:33,991
national story,
let's say she didn't get caught on 

5306
03:38:33,991 --> 03:38:33,991
camera hitting a guy with a stick,
right?

5307
03:38:33,991 --> 03:38:36,100
But some kid stands up who's a 
conservative in middle school,

5308
03:38:36,400 --> 03:38:38,200
I was that way where I would argue with 
the teacher,

5309
03:38:38,440 --> 03:38:39,460
um,
and just as well,

5310
03:38:39,520 --> 03:38:44,520
I think you're wrong.
And she kicks that kid out of class and 

5311
03:38:44,520 --> 03:38:44,870
just says that kid's being disruptive 
and,

5312
03:38:45,160 --> 03:38:47,560
or a fat.
Let's say that teacher is the principal,

5313
03:38:47,740 --> 03:38:52,740
gets the kid expelled from school.
These people have these little enclaves 

5314
03:38:52,740 --> 03:38:53,560
of poWer,
these positions of authority and parents

5315
03:38:53,561 --> 03:38:57,340
kind of have to trust the teacher.
So you see that it's a national story.

5316
03:38:57,341 --> 03:39:02,341
She's exposed,
but what about all the teachers who 

5317
03:39:02,341 --> 03:39:03,640
aren't?
I had a teacher complained to my parents

5318
03:39:03,641 --> 03:39:08,641
and talk about how disrespectful I was 
and what a horrible person it was 

5319
03:39:08,641 --> 03:39:10,120
because I think in the ninth grade I 
actually argued,

5320
03:39:10,121 --> 03:39:15,121
I was like,
I actually don't think we should give 

5321
03:39:15,121 --> 03:39:15,121
the land back to the native americans 
when she was teaching with the teacher.

5322
03:39:15,121 --> 03:39:19,860
Fuck you.
But I made an argument and she argument.

5323
03:39:20,921 --> 03:39:22,210
What did you say?
Um,

5324
03:39:22,260 --> 03:39:23,260
well I was,
I was a smart ass.

5325
03:39:23,261 --> 03:39:24,910
So this was me as you know,
as a 14 year old.

5326
03:39:24,950 --> 03:39:28,310
But I said,
the fact that I remember the shoe,

5327
03:39:28,340 --> 03:39:33,340
I won't use her name.
I was say the fact that you're wearing 

5328
03:39:33,340 --> 03:39:33,340
levi's and because you have a sore 
throat,

5329
03:39:33,340 --> 03:39:35,570
you're speaking to an electronic speaker
when you dress,

5330
03:39:35,571 --> 03:39:40,571
drove here in a toyota yarus and you're 
going to like electric electrically 

5331
03:39:40,571 --> 03:39:41,180
powered school.
uh,

5332
03:39:41,181 --> 03:39:44,150
in a union tells me you're glad that we 
settled here.

5333
03:39:45,080 --> 03:39:46,220
And she just,
she didn't answer.

5334
03:39:46,250 --> 03:39:51,250
She didn't argue.
She just sent me out of class and I 

5335
03:39:51,250 --> 03:39:51,250
remember the next morning I thought it 
was.

5336
03:39:51,250 --> 03:39:56,050
I didn't really think my dad was furious
because he got a call from someone 

5337
03:39:56,050 --> 03:39:58,250
saying I was disrupting class,
or she asked students was you dealt with

5338
03:39:58,251 --> 03:39:58,610
that?

5339
03:39:58,610 --> 03:40:01,080
And the teacher know he's mad at me.
Why was he mad at you?

5340
03:40:01,130 --> 03:40:02,310
Because he didn't get the full story.
He just,

5341
03:40:02,540 --> 03:40:04,760
he just hears steven's being immensely 
disrespectful.

5342
03:40:05,180 --> 03:40:07,370
Talking back in class,
she didn't hear the.

5343
03:40:07,820 --> 03:40:09,590
She asked for an opinion.
This was mrt.

5344
03:40:09,591 --> 03:40:14,270
Moral religious education was a class we
had to take in my religious education.

5345
03:40:14,271 --> 03:40:19,271
Yep.
So there's guilt for the first nation 

5346
03:40:19,271 --> 03:40:19,271
people up in Canada.
Is that what it is?

5347
03:40:19,271 --> 03:40:20,630
This just specific professor.
And a matter of fact,

5348
03:40:20,631 --> 03:40:23,720
I learned what right wing was because I 
remember at one point,

5349
03:40:23,721 --> 03:40:24,920
so that,
so right wing.

5350
03:40:24,921 --> 03:40:26,360
That's so right.
And I didn't know what it was.

5351
03:40:26,361 --> 03:40:28,820
I was 14.
I had said something and I said,

5352
03:40:28,910 --> 03:40:31,000
dad,
what does right wing says?

5353
03:40:31,010 --> 03:40:36,010
Well,
and it kind of explain to me the 

5354
03:40:36,010 --> 03:40:36,010
political spectrum.
I said,

5355
03:40:36,010 --> 03:40:36,440
okay,
I guess I am right wing in.

5356
03:40:37,190 --> 03:40:40,870
I was in alberta and I was with some 
friends who live up there and uh,

5357
03:40:40,910 --> 03:40:44,300
we were fishing and uh,
we were fishing right next to these,

5358
03:40:44,301 --> 03:40:46,910
a first nation people,
which is their native americans,

5359
03:40:46,911 --> 03:40:48,380
right.
And uh,

5360
03:40:48,650 --> 03:40:51,740
they have a limit of walleye that you 
can take.

5361
03:40:52,130 --> 03:40:54,560
You can only take one walleye per day,
right?

5362
03:40:54,590 --> 03:40:57,530
If you're a regular person.
But if you're a first nations person,

5363
03:40:57,560 --> 03:40:58,430
you could just,
yeah,

5364
03:40:58,730 --> 03:41:01,370
pull in as many as you want.
And uh,

5365
03:41:01,470 --> 03:41:02,510
and,
and I was like,

5366
03:41:03,590 --> 03:41:05,060
how does that work?
And they go,

5367
03:41:05,090 --> 03:41:06,320
oh,
it's way crazier than that.

5368
03:41:06,560 --> 03:41:11,560
They can go out at night with spotlights
and shine them on moose and gunned them 

5369
03:41:12,111 --> 03:41:13,120
down from trucks.
Right.

5370
03:41:13,130 --> 03:41:14,750
Because then it frees them the 
spotlight.

5371
03:41:14,770 --> 03:41:15,740
Yeah.
They don't know what it is.

5372
03:41:15,940 --> 03:41:17,690
Stand still and they try to figure out 
what the,

5373
03:41:17,750 --> 03:41:22,750
what's going.
Moose don't see spotlights ever in the 

5374
03:41:22,750 --> 03:41:22,750
real world.

5375
03:41:22,750 --> 03:41:22,750
So yeah.
So when they see,

5376
03:41:22,750 --> 03:41:25,760
when they freeze and they shoot them 
with guns from trucks and I was like,

5377
03:41:25,870 --> 03:41:27,590
what?
So they're alloWed to poach.

5378
03:41:27,620 --> 03:41:28,370
Well,
it's not poaching.

5379
03:41:28,371 --> 03:41:29,240
They can do whatever they want.
I go,

5380
03:41:29,241 --> 03:41:34,241
well,
how many are they allowed to kill as 

5381
03:41:34,241 --> 03:41:34,241
many as they want so they can kill all 
the moose.

5382
03:41:34,241 --> 03:41:34,820
They can kill all the most.
Whoa.

5383
03:41:35,140 --> 03:41:36,140
I was like,
that is,

5384
03:41:36,141 --> 03:41:37,680
that seems.
That seems odd.

5385
03:41:37,681 --> 03:41:39,800
What makes a great argument in the 
native american case is actually,

5386
03:41:39,830 --> 03:41:41,630
have you read [inaudible] book?
No,

5387
03:41:41,870 --> 03:41:44,080
it's very interesting.
And he talks about this,

5388
03:41:44,110 --> 03:41:45,950
like michael medved and dennis prager 
have talked about this,

5389
03:41:45,951 --> 03:41:50,210
but I was surprised as to how cogent 
arguments where he's a very smart guy.

5390
03:41:50,930 --> 03:41:52,490
He's a very smart guy.
Um,

5391
03:41:52,760 --> 03:41:57,760
and then he always kind of play.
He plays it down or plays it up when 

5392
03:41:57,760 --> 03:41:57,760
it's convenient.
But if you read his book he talks about,

5393
03:41:57,760 --> 03:41:58,310
he says it's just a numbers game.

5394
03:41:58,640 --> 03:42:03,640
The reason that we were able to colonize
here is entirely because of native 

5395
03:42:03,640 --> 03:42:04,770
americans.
They were being [inaudible].

5396
03:42:04,780 --> 03:42:06,770
He wrote about it in a way I'm 
butchering it,

5397
03:42:06,771 --> 03:42:08,630
but he said like when we came,
for example,

5398
03:42:08,631 --> 03:42:10,100
like let's talk about the mayans.
He goes,

5399
03:42:10,160 --> 03:42:13,820
they had literally a pyramids are as 
tech,

5400
03:42:13,821 --> 03:42:18,821
whatever.
They had buildings entirely full of 

5401
03:42:18,821 --> 03:42:18,821
cold.
He goes,

5402
03:42:18,821 --> 03:42:21,251
now,
how do you think they procured said 

5403
03:42:21,251 --> 03:42:23,201
gold?
Do you think that they mayBe went to 

5404
03:42:23,201 --> 03:42:24,710
other tribes or other members and said 
you are going to bring us this coal gold

5405
03:42:24,711 --> 03:42:29,711
or be die,
and so what happened was thousands upon 

5406
03:42:29,711 --> 03:42:30,560
thousands,
tens of thousands,

5407
03:42:30,561 --> 03:42:35,561
maybe hundreds,
thousands said one of the keys to doors 

5408
03:42:35,561 --> 03:42:36,120
came who would never have had enough to 
take over that area of the world said,

5409
03:42:36,420 --> 03:42:41,420
we're going to take our chances with the
red guys with the beards and the metal 

5410
03:42:41,420 --> 03:42:43,320
helmets because they'd been treated so 
poorly for so long and the same thing.

5411
03:42:43,320 --> 03:42:45,330
If you look at the algonquins in the 
iroquois and come back,

5412
03:42:45,331 --> 03:42:50,331
those were the tribes that we had and 
the kind of the packs that they would 

5413
03:42:50,331 --> 03:42:50,331
have,
and listen,

5414
03:42:50,331 --> 03:42:50,700
they screwed them.
Don't get me wrong.

5415
03:42:50,701 --> 03:42:55,701
They really screwed them with the 
firewater thing and they pulled the rug 

5416
03:42:55,701 --> 03:42:55,701
out from under them.
I'm not defending it,

5417
03:42:55,701 --> 03:42:58,110
but the idea that we came in and just 
conquered these people know there were a

5418
03:42:58,111 --> 03:43:03,111
lot of people who were mistreated 
because it's horse culture that they 

5419
03:43:03,111 --> 03:43:03,111
did.
First off,

5420
03:43:03,111 --> 03:43:05,530
they hadn't domesticated horses.
They didn't even use the wheel and uh,

5421
03:43:05,560 --> 03:43:10,560
so a lot of the things that we're taught
are not true and we're taught that they 

5422
03:43:10,560 --> 03:43:10,560
were peaceful.
No,

5423
03:43:10,560 --> 03:43:14,570
they weren't peaceful.
That's why all of a sudden these new 

5424
03:43:14,570 --> 03:43:15,510
people who came in with sticks that go 
boom,

5425
03:43:15,750 --> 03:43:20,750
had thousands of native americans at 
their disposal who were willing to die 

5426
03:43:20,750 --> 03:43:21,900
with them because they were tired of 
being treated that way,

5427
03:43:22,680 --> 03:43:23,610
and I made some arguments.

5428
03:43:23,610 --> 03:43:25,230
Maybe that affect,
got in trouble,

5429
03:43:25,231 --> 03:43:26,550
got sent home.
Well,

5430
03:43:26,551 --> 03:43:29,130
it's a complicated issue that spans 
hundreds of years,

5431
03:43:29,131 --> 03:43:33,030
but there was certainly inter tribal 
warfare and the word that the use,

5432
03:43:33,060 --> 03:43:35,370
they don't use the word sue,
they use the word lakota.

5433
03:43:35,371 --> 03:43:38,550
They call themselves the lakota people.
Sue's award for enemy.

5434
03:43:38,730 --> 03:43:43,730
That's what it means.
So like that's what other native 

5435
03:43:43,730 --> 03:43:44,010
american cultures would call them.
They call them the enemy because they're

5436
03:43:44,011 --> 03:43:46,620
killing each other.
The nez perce and the apaches,

5437
03:43:46,830 --> 03:43:48,870
they would go to war with each other.
Neighboring tribes.

5438
03:43:48,871 --> 03:43:51,810
It was constant.
It's just when the europeans came,

5439
03:43:51,811 --> 03:43:54,750
they were so overwhelming that we feel 
bad for what they did.

5440
03:43:54,840 --> 03:43:55,290
But you know,
what?

5441
03:43:55,291 --> 03:43:57,240
Killed more native americans than 
anything.

5442
03:43:57,540 --> 03:44:00,420
Our diseases are dirty,
dirty bugs.

5443
03:44:00,510 --> 03:44:05,510
Yeah.
We came over here and coughed on them 

5444
03:44:05,510 --> 03:44:05,510
and they all fucking died.
Well,

5445
03:44:05,510 --> 03:44:05,510
that's another thing too,
right?

5446
03:44:05,510 --> 03:44:06,810
That we killed them deliberately with 
smallpox blankets.

5447
03:44:07,150 --> 03:44:08,640
That's true.
That's not true.

5448
03:44:08,641 --> 03:44:09,660
We didn't.
We didn't even understand.

5449
03:44:09,661 --> 03:44:11,520
We didn't have germ theory.
They didn't understand.

5450
03:44:11,580 --> 03:44:13,740
They didn't.
They didn't understand that scabs.

5451
03:44:13,741 --> 03:44:18,741
If you'd like to leave.
The idea was you take scabs from people 

5452
03:44:18,741 --> 03:44:21,111
with fucking diseases and you put them 
on blankets and he gave them native 

5453
03:44:21,111 --> 03:44:22,870
americans out rubbing your hands.
No,

5454
03:44:22,890 --> 03:44:27,890
that's a big thing with horses.
They hadn't domesticated horses and a 

5455
03:44:27,890 --> 03:44:28,590
lot of animals.
So think about that.

5456
03:44:28,860 --> 03:44:33,860
You've never come in contact with these 
animals there in the wild and all of a 

5457
03:44:33,860 --> 03:44:36,471
sudden these people are coming off 
effectively with a boat that's a giant 

5458
03:44:36,471 --> 03:44:39,171
farm and they're bringing these animals 
and that you've never had contact with 

5459
03:44:39,171 --> 03:44:39,171
before.
all kinds of disease.

5460
03:44:39,180 --> 03:44:41,430
Oh sure.
Well that's the thing that people.

5461
03:44:41,460 --> 03:44:43,680
A lot of people who don't understand 
where diseases come from,

5462
03:44:43,710 --> 03:44:46,500
a giant percentage of them come from our
livestock,

5463
03:44:46,610 --> 03:44:46,740
right?

5464
03:44:46,840 --> 03:44:51,100
That's why you have swine flu and avian 
viruses and all those different things.

5465
03:44:51,220 --> 03:44:53,400
Sars in the toronto airport,
only Canada.

5466
03:44:54,280 --> 03:44:55,710
It was brought back.
Sars.

5467
03:44:55,880 --> 03:44:58,520
You were the only ones who had sars.
What was that?

5468
03:44:58,710 --> 03:45:00,390
What was what it stands for?
I don't remember.

5469
03:45:00,391 --> 03:45:02,730
I jusT knew.
I knew all the asians were wearing those

5470
03:45:02,731 --> 03:45:06,710
masks at the toronto airport.
I remember that one.

5471
03:45:06,920 --> 03:45:07,900
Well,
how about a bowl?

5472
03:45:07,901 --> 03:45:09,370
It was just a year ago,
but it's fucking.

5473
03:45:09,390 --> 03:45:13,020
We're going to die a bola.
That fucking chick from New Jersey.

5474
03:45:13,021 --> 03:45:13,650
That bitch.
She's.

5475
03:45:13,850 --> 03:45:15,840
She left the hospital.
right.

5476
03:45:16,150 --> 03:45:21,150
There is a big deal.
So much flack from conservatives to 

5477
03:45:21,150 --> 03:45:21,150
[inaudible].
I was like,

5478
03:45:21,150 --> 03:45:24,800
listen,
I don't like barack obama as a 

5479
03:45:24,800 --> 03:45:26,631
president,
but you can't blame a bowl on the guy 

5480
03:45:26,631 --> 03:45:26,631
and we're like,
oh fuck you.

5481
03:45:26,631 --> 03:45:28,730
African africa from Kenya.
I know.

5482
03:45:28,731 --> 03:45:33,731
You know,
and that's one of those things where I 

5483
03:45:33,731 --> 03:45:33,731
know I'm seen as an ideologue,
but sending.

5484
03:45:33,731 --> 03:45:34,450
We get so much flack for criticizing 
Donald Trump,

5485
03:45:34,451 --> 03:45:35,120
for example,
on,

5486
03:45:35,440 --> 03:45:37,030
on some trade policies.
Really.

5487
03:45:37,110 --> 03:45:42,110
I just think this is bad.
That's the big thing that you've been 

5488
03:45:42,110 --> 03:45:44,971
criticized about trump for that.
I've been criticized for theater show 

5489
03:45:44,971 --> 03:45:47,200
just for criticizing him at all.
Anything and toe the line.

5490
03:45:47,380 --> 03:45:49,450
Yeah.
People get real versus them bro.

5491
03:45:49,480 --> 03:45:54,480
Well,
because you know they're used to lIke 

5492
03:45:54,480 --> 03:45:54,480
you.
You've had people on the show.

5493
03:45:54,480 --> 03:45:54,480
You've even mentioned in this program,
people who are.

5494
03:45:54,480 --> 03:45:55,830
They're only,
they're only his on data,

5495
03:45:55,950 --> 03:46:00,950
right?
Is being a concern is being a 

5496
03:46:00,950 --> 03:46:00,950
provocateur to offender and there's,
there's a purpose to that.

5497
03:46:00,950 --> 03:46:02,950
But if just offending people as the end 
goal.

5498
03:46:03,460 --> 03:46:04,750
And I really don't think that's what we 
do.

5499
03:46:04,751 --> 03:46:09,751
If people actually watched the show,
I mean people actually watch the show 

5500
03:46:09,751 --> 03:46:09,751
every day,
an hour of content.

5501
03:46:09,751 --> 03:46:11,320
Most of it is really pretty reasonable.

5502
03:46:11,320 --> 03:46:13,600
They see the highlight reel of me 
dressing as a trainee interviewing wendy

5503
03:46:13,601 --> 03:46:14,280
davis,
right?

5504
03:46:14,360 --> 03:46:17,680
That's from thousands and thousands of 
hours of the program.

5505
03:46:19,120 --> 03:46:20,950
So we criticize them all the time,
but you know,

5506
03:46:20,951 --> 03:46:23,380
less and less because every time he does
something stupid,

5507
03:46:23,381 --> 03:46:28,381
the left as something so bad.
So where it's like calling them 

5508
03:46:28,381 --> 03:46:29,700
literally hitler.
Like that woman who was a school teacher

5509
03:46:29,720 --> 03:46:34,680
was talking about the origin.
Jeffrey's really bothered with the woman

5510
03:46:34,710 --> 03:46:37,480
who was a school teacher was.
She was talking about that,

5511
03:46:37,510 --> 03:46:42,510
just just labeling.
They're all fascists and you have to 

5512
03:46:42,510 --> 03:46:44,710
stop fascist and then when he described,
when he asked her what is a fascist,

5513
03:46:44,920 --> 03:46:49,920
she gave like this shitbag definition of
what a fascist is and only suited her 

5514
03:46:49,920 --> 03:46:53,341
knee.
Let's pull up the actual literal 

5515
03:46:53,341 --> 03:46:55,951
definition of fascist young jamie.
What is the literal definition of 

5516
03:46:55,951 --> 03:47:00,541
fascist?
As I interpreted it is I did a video on 

5517
03:47:00,541 --> 03:47:01,180
this and here's what's so funny.

5518
03:47:01,210 --> 03:47:06,210
If I'm not mistaken,
google's definition brings up fascism 

5519
03:47:06,210 --> 03:47:09,180
and mentions right wing,
but if you bring up communism or 

5520
03:47:09,180 --> 03:47:10,180
socialism,
maybe it's authoritarianism.

5521
03:47:10,181 --> 03:47:15,181
Something that's very clearly left wing.
They don't actually mention the left 

5522
03:47:15,181 --> 03:47:15,181
wing.
Okay,

5523
03:47:15,181 --> 03:47:19,140
and advocate or follower of the 
political philosophy or system of 

5524
03:47:19,140 --> 03:47:23,671
fascism.
He went to Spain to fight against the 

5525
03:47:23,671 --> 03:47:24,920
fascist to extreme right wingers,
extreme right winger,

5526
03:47:24,930 --> 03:47:29,930
rightest,
or a military coup throughout the old 

5527
03:47:29,930 --> 03:47:30,850
fascist regime,
synonymous authoritarian,

5528
03:47:31,090 --> 03:47:33,880
totalitarian,
dictatorial.

5529
03:47:33,930 --> 03:47:38,930
See,
this is where it gets weird because 

5530
03:47:38,930 --> 03:47:39,520
undemocratic illiberal now type and 
communism,

5531
03:47:39,550 --> 03:47:41,170
but authority,
but hold on a second.

5532
03:47:41,171 --> 03:47:45,250
The authoritarian and totalitarian like 
this.

5533
03:47:45,310 --> 03:47:49,150
When you talk about extreme left wing 
ideologues,

5534
03:47:49,420 --> 03:47:53,140
you are talking about authoritarians and
you're talking about totalitarian.

5535
03:47:53,141 --> 03:47:58,141
Yeah,
and you're also talking about people 

5536
03:47:58,141 --> 03:47:59,881
that would advocate violence against 
anyone who does not fit their mold of 

5537
03:48:02,141 --> 03:48:07,141
how a person think or behave and what 
they do is they call them a fascist or 

5538
03:48:07,141 --> 03:48:10,150
they called him a nazi and that lets 
them alleviate themselves,

5539
03:48:10,151 --> 03:48:15,151
have any guilt of being a violent person
against these people and that's what 

5540
03:48:15,151 --> 03:48:19,141
happened at berkeley and that's why this
woman felt no irony about being on 

5541
03:48:19,141 --> 03:48:22,330
television saying that milo is a 
homophobe when he's a gay guy.

5542
03:48:22,380 --> 03:48:24,670
Once she was also talking about 
justifying beating up people who weren't

5543
03:48:24,671 --> 03:48:25,270
milo.
Jimmy,

5544
03:48:25,670 --> 03:48:29,000
could you hit authoritarian real?
Yeah.

5545
03:48:29,690 --> 03:48:34,690
Okay.
Favoring or enforcing strict obedience 

5546
03:48:34,690 --> 03:48:38,231
or authority,
especially especially that of the 

5547
03:48:38,231 --> 03:48:40,271
government of the expensive personal.
Now do me a favor type in communism and 

5548
03:48:40,271 --> 03:48:44,231
I want you to see the google,
so it just said right wing extremism 

5549
03:48:44,231 --> 03:48:46,901
right with fascism,
which is not a right wing ideology and 

5550
03:48:46,901 --> 03:48:49,391
own communism.
Do we all agree is an inherently left 

5551
03:48:49,391 --> 03:48:49,391
wing ideology?
Yeah.

5552
03:48:49,391 --> 03:48:53,381
Well,
a political theory derived from karl 

5553
03:48:53,381 --> 03:48:53,381
marx,
well,

5554
03:48:53,381 --> 03:48:56,081
there's a lot of,
like I had Jordan Peterson on the 

5555
03:48:56,081 --> 03:48:58,121
podcast,
we talked about how was like 

5556
03:48:58,121 --> 03:49:01,570
progressives who are sensitive and kind 
people gradually gravitate towards 

5557
03:49:03,021 --> 03:49:07,250
marxism and a lot of ways because the 
initial draw seems appealing,

5558
03:49:07,251 --> 03:49:12,251
advocating class,
war and leading to a society in which 

5559
03:49:12,251 --> 03:49:15,011
all property is publicly owned and each 
person works and is paid for according 

5560
03:49:15,381 --> 03:49:16,550
to their abilities and needs.

5561
03:49:16,550 --> 03:49:19,160
So here's the point,
and I wrote about this.

5562
03:49:19,161 --> 03:49:24,161
I think we did a video on this fascism,
which is not inherently right wing at 

5563
03:49:24,161 --> 03:49:24,780
all.
No,

5564
03:49:24,781 --> 03:49:25,940
it's not.
They,

5565
03:49:25,941 --> 03:49:27,050
right,
right wing,

5566
03:49:27,140 --> 03:49:29,630
extreme right wing,
illiberal communism,

5567
03:49:29,930 --> 03:49:34,930
which inherently has to be left wing.
It is the definition of the political 

5568
03:49:34,930 --> 03:49:37,820
spectrum of left wing would be communism
and capitalism,

5569
03:49:38,180 --> 03:49:39,860
and then in between can be 
authoritarianism.

5570
03:49:40,010 --> 03:49:41,870
Fascism,
depending on the regime,

5571
03:49:42,680 --> 03:49:46,190
no mention of left wing with communism 
because I know there's google,

5572
03:49:46,220 --> 03:49:47,450
they know there's a negative 
connotation.

5573
03:49:47,451 --> 03:49:49,790
It's the first one that comes up,
but fascism,

5574
03:49:49,910 --> 03:49:52,940
authoritarianism,
they immediately try to attribute to the

5575
03:49:52,941 --> 03:49:57,941
right.
That's what people are fighting back 

5576
03:49:57,941 --> 03:49:57,941
again when they.
When they talk about media and fake news

5577
03:49:57,941 --> 03:49:59,000
and the constant bias,
you see it,

5578
03:49:59,001 --> 03:50:00,470
there was google.
That's not fair.

5579
03:50:00,600 --> 03:50:02,180
Right.
Do you think there's a problem with also

5580
03:50:02,181 --> 03:50:06,200
defining things in terms of a word like 
marxism or like communism,

5581
03:50:06,201 --> 03:50:08,500
like let's just talk about like what are
you trying to do?

5582
03:50:08,540 --> 03:50:13,540
Like what are.
What are you actually trying to appeal 

5583
03:50:13,540 --> 03:50:15,560
to when you're saying that you can have 
someone speak at your university if they

5584
03:50:15,561 --> 03:50:18,620
say things that you don't agree with?
Like do you remember the story about the

5585
03:50:18,621 --> 03:50:23,621
university of toronto?
Really famous story guy who is an 

5586
03:50:23,621 --> 03:50:26,621
author.
They completely misrepresented what his 

5587
03:50:26,621 --> 03:50:29,081
book was about.
They were saying he's pro rape culture 

5588
03:50:29,081 --> 03:50:29,081
and these feminist shut it down.
They pulled fire alarms.

5589
03:50:29,210 --> 03:50:32,360
The famous red haired lady who's fucking
screaming at people.

5590
03:50:33,390 --> 03:50:36,130
I remember her name,
melissa click click.

5591
03:50:36,310 --> 03:50:36,670
No,
no,

5592
03:50:36,680 --> 03:50:41,680
no.
That's the one from the university of 

5593
03:50:41,680 --> 03:50:41,680
Missouri.
Oh,

5594
03:50:41,680 --> 03:50:44,011
that's.
I'm talking about the one from toronto 

5595
03:50:44,011 --> 03:50:46,090
who is like this.
Like she's kind of funny in a way 

5596
03:50:46,090 --> 03:50:46,090
because she was like,
shut up fuck face.

5597
03:50:46,090 --> 03:50:48,530
I'm talking.
She's the rambler.

5598
03:50:48,560 --> 03:50:52,370
That red hair glasses.
I mean,

5599
03:50:52,870 --> 03:50:57,870
that was the,
that was this crazy moment in time where

5600
03:50:58,071 --> 03:51:03,071
this guy had scheduled an appearance to 
speak about his book and someone had 

5601
03:51:03,411 --> 03:51:04,700
misrepresented his book.

5602
03:51:04,750 --> 03:51:09,750
He decided what his book was actually 
all about and decided that they were 

5603
03:51:09,750 --> 03:51:13,241
going to have a campaign to make sure 
that this guy couldn't talk so people 

5604
03:51:13,241 --> 03:51:16,661
would show up and they would try to just
go to listen to this guy talk and women 

5605
03:51:16,661 --> 03:51:19,160
were screaming in their face,
you fucking rapist you piece of shit.

5606
03:51:19,280 --> 03:51:21,020
And The guy's like,
I want to hear the guy talk.

5607
03:51:21,080 --> 03:51:22,550
Can I hear the guy talk?
No,

5608
03:51:22,610 --> 03:51:24,140
they wouldn't let people.
I mean,

5609
03:51:24,141 --> 03:51:26,230
that is fascism,
isn't it?

5610
03:51:26,430 --> 03:51:31,430
Well,
it happened to with ann coulter in 

5611
03:51:31,430 --> 03:51:31,430
toronto.
I remember.

5612
03:51:31,430 --> 03:51:31,430
and whether you agree with her and he 
deserves it.

5613
03:51:31,430 --> 03:51:34,130
I disagree with on the line,
but she was a.

5614
03:51:34,230 --> 03:51:35,160
She was asking me like,
what?

5615
03:51:35,290 --> 03:51:35,670
And I said,
well,

5616
03:51:35,671 --> 03:51:40,671
you understand,
freedom of speech doesn't really exist 

5617
03:51:40,671 --> 03:51:40,671
in Canada.
As a matter of fact,

5618
03:51:40,671 --> 03:51:40,671
it doesn't exist outside of the United 
States.

5619
03:51:40,671 --> 03:51:42,300
It really doesn't exist in Canada.
They have some weird rule,

5620
03:51:42,301 --> 03:51:47,301
doesn't exist in europe and when I told 
her that she couldn't and then actually 

5621
03:51:47,301 --> 03:51:48,340
someone went on news on the news and 
said,

5622
03:51:48,780 --> 03:51:53,780
well,
what ann coulter needs to understand is 

5623
03:51:53,780 --> 03:51:55,551
that America has this idea of free 
speech and rugged individualism and all 

5624
03:51:55,551 --> 03:51:59,031
speech is protected,
but that's not the case in Canada and 

5625
03:51:59,031 --> 03:52:02,061
this was the representative.
They trotted out where she basically 

5626
03:52:02,061 --> 03:52:02,061
said freedom of speech does not exist in
Canada,

5627
03:52:02,061 --> 03:52:04,710
and so you can read the youtube comments
where every time I say freedom of speech

5628
03:52:04,711 --> 03:52:06,690
doesn't exist in Canada.
Thousands of people.

5629
03:52:06,691 --> 03:52:11,691
That's bullshit because they thinK they 
get to type in an internet message 

5630
03:52:11,691 --> 03:52:14,181
board,
but you can be jailed in Canada for st 

5631
03:52:14,181 --> 03:52:14,181
louis where you can lose your business.
This is a human rights council.

5632
03:52:14,320 --> 03:52:15,960
We talked about it.
Actually my story.

5633
03:52:16,090 --> 03:52:18,480
Did you have him that you know,
but we talked about.

5634
03:52:18,510 --> 03:52:23,510
Well,
he's got a different case that's from 

5635
03:52:23,510 --> 03:52:24,851
montreal.
We talked about the comedian from 

5636
03:52:24,851 --> 03:52:24,990
vancouver that had the altercation with 
the lesbians and the crowd.

5637
03:52:24,991 --> 03:52:29,991
They were heckling him and the comedians
before and he called them some fucking 

5638
03:52:29,991 --> 03:52:33,190
you pussy dykes or whatever.
He saId something crazy and they sent 

5639
03:52:33,190 --> 03:52:33,190
him and won.
They won.

5640
03:52:33,190 --> 03:52:33,780
Yeah.
He like,

5641
03:52:33,960 --> 03:52:35,790
he had pe.
I don't know if He's paid,

5642
03:52:35,791 --> 03:52:37,650
but hit.
It was tens of thousands of dollars.

5643
03:52:37,651 --> 03:52:41,910
I think it was something like $15,000
this fucking guy had to pay to.

5644
03:52:41,911 --> 03:52:43,360
These people were hecklers.
yeah.

5645
03:52:43,650 --> 03:52:47,280
I know that people.
I get more people to the left versus.

5646
03:52:47,281 --> 03:52:52,281
Right.
This is why it does matter because I 

5647
03:52:52,281 --> 03:52:52,281
lived through it in quebec.
In quebec,

5648
03:52:52,281 --> 03:52:56,541
we only have the left.
We have liberals and then liberal 

5649
03:52:56,541 --> 03:52:56,541
separatists.
That's it.

5650
03:52:56,541 --> 03:52:56,541
There's no.

5651
03:52:56,541 --> 03:53:01,060
There's liberals and those liberals who 
want to only speak french and separate 

5652
03:53:01,060 --> 03:53:01,060
from the rest of Canada.
yeah,

5653
03:53:01,060 --> 03:53:01,650
exactly.
That's a weird place,

5654
03:53:01,651 --> 03:53:03,330
right?
It's a very weird place.

5655
03:53:03,331 --> 03:53:05,850
It's not like the rest of Canada.
It's multiculturalism gone awry.

5656
03:53:05,851 --> 03:53:07,800
The french were a conquered people.
it should have been shut up.

5657
03:53:07,801 --> 03:53:09,810
You're speaking english instead.
They said it's cute.

5658
03:53:09,811 --> 03:53:14,811
Let's let them have the little enclave 
and now it's just a nightmare for the 

5659
03:53:14,811 --> 03:53:17,271
rest of the.
That's where white golfers are afraid 

5660
03:53:17,271 --> 03:53:18,861
about with California.
Is that what you're just going to 

5661
03:53:18,861 --> 03:53:19,230
dominate and turn this whole thing into 
a mexican speaking joint?

5662
03:53:19,770 --> 03:53:20,700
I don't remember what we were talking 
about.

5663
03:53:20,790 --> 03:53:21,850
Oh yeah,
the left,

5664
03:53:22,140 --> 03:53:24,900
because I do think you do one at a 
certain point.

5665
03:53:24,960 --> 03:53:29,960
I think a lot of people are readily 
acknowledging now that those stories 

5666
03:53:29,960 --> 03:53:30,060
that you're talking about,
the red haired girl,

5667
03:53:30,210 --> 03:53:32,580
the melissa click is asian lady.

5668
03:53:32,970 --> 03:53:35,310
You really can't find that today on the 
right.

5669
03:53:35,350 --> 03:53:40,350
Right.
It just doesn't exist today and the 

5670
03:53:40,350 --> 03:53:40,350
right and that exist like that.
What doesn't exist period.

5671
03:53:40,350 --> 03:53:40,770
On the right,
you know,

5672
03:53:40,771 --> 03:53:45,771
people try to point to like add parental
advisory lyrics and stuff and he 

5673
03:53:45,771 --> 03:53:46,390
probably has to pee as badly as I do in 
my gut.

5674
03:53:47,660 --> 03:53:49,170
That was tip or go away.
Yeah.

5675
03:53:49,171 --> 03:53:51,840
Know the parental advisory thing from 
the eighties when they were trying.

5676
03:53:52,020 --> 03:53:54,540
She was trying to ban rap music.
People forget about that.

5677
03:53:54,541 --> 03:53:59,541
Al gore's wIfe was trying to ban rap 
music and christians never wanted to 

5678
03:53:59,541 --> 03:54:00,090
band south park thing where they talked 
about.

5679
03:54:00,091 --> 03:54:00,450
They said,
no,

5680
03:54:00,451 --> 03:54:01,710
we don't.
We just don't want it on it.

5681
03:54:01,711 --> 03:54:04,450
Not we wanted on late at night,
we don't want our kids watching it.

5682
03:54:04,470 --> 03:54:06,300
Never my tray,
parker and matt stone does it,

5683
03:54:06,301 --> 03:54:07,800
matte stone,
ems stone and trey parker.

5684
03:54:08,040 --> 03:54:13,040
I saw matt speak at ut and he just a guy
stood up and he was like asking this 

5685
03:54:13,040 --> 03:54:13,040
question,
like,

5686
03:54:13,040 --> 03:54:14,490
how do you fight back against these 
christians?

5687
03:54:14,491 --> 03:54:15,240
And he actually said,
he said,

5688
03:54:15,241 --> 03:54:15,630
well,
you know what?

5689
03:54:15,631 --> 03:54:20,631
He said,
we've actually never had an issue 

5690
03:54:20,631 --> 03:54:22,910
really.
He said they don't want it on a prime 

5691
03:54:22,910 --> 03:54:22,910
time.
We don't want it on in prime time.

5692
03:54:22,910 --> 03:54:23,470
We've seen them as an ally is and you 
said,

5693
03:54:23,471 --> 03:54:24,100
contrast

5694
03:54:24,100 --> 03:54:29,100
that to the comedy central reaction 
where they decided to cut an episode 

5695
03:54:29,100 --> 03:54:32,431
because we put muhammad in it and that 
tells you who's really empowered 

5696
03:54:32,431 --> 03:54:34,660
something to that effect.
But the kid who was at ut in austin,

5697
03:54:34,661 --> 03:54:39,661
my brother went to ut so he would get 
access to all of these speeches or 

5698
03:54:39,661 --> 03:54:40,510
presentations.
The kid was dumbfounded.

5699
03:54:40,511 --> 03:54:40,890
He thought,
well,

5700
03:54:40,900 --> 03:54:42,220
matt stones,
not one of me,

5701
03:54:42,221 --> 03:54:43,930
and matt stone is not a conservative,
not a republican.

5702
03:54:43,931 --> 03:54:47,320
He's not a trump supporter,
but he Just recognizes the intolerance.

5703
03:54:47,321 --> 03:54:52,321
Today of the progressive left,
well there's definitely an issue when 

5704
03:54:52,321 --> 03:54:55,891
you have that woman,
melissa glick lady who was yelling at 

5705
03:54:55,891 --> 03:54:57,670
that kid who was just a for tog grapher.
He was a journalist.

5706
03:54:57,800 --> 03:55:02,800
Yeah,
and I think he was hired to be there in 

5707
03:55:02,800 --> 03:55:04,060
a public space who was asian and he's 
taking pictures and she said,

5708
03:55:04,061 --> 03:55:09,061
can I,
can we get some muscle here because 

5709
03:55:09,061 --> 03:55:09,061
we've created a saFe space.

5710
03:55:09,061 --> 03:55:10,960
You tank can't take photos of our 
protests and our sit in,

5711
03:55:10,961 --> 03:55:15,961
in our safe space about racism,
so we're going to get this asian guy 

5712
03:55:15,961 --> 03:55:16,930
because you don't understand black 
America.

5713
03:55:16,931 --> 03:55:19,390
like what the fuck.
How long do you think she was waiting to

5714
03:55:19,391 --> 03:55:21,040
say,
I just want to use the term muscle.

5715
03:55:21,130 --> 03:55:23,160
Oh man.
She was just gonna say get some here.

5716
03:55:23,410 --> 03:55:28,410
She was intolerant in that.
She was very adamant about getting her 

5717
03:55:28,410 --> 03:55:29,860
way and she did not consider whether or 
not they were in a public place and this

5718
03:55:29,861 --> 03:55:31,660
kid hAd the right to take those 
photographs.

5719
03:55:31,840 --> 03:55:32,620
And again,
like you said,

5720
03:55:32,621 --> 03:55:37,621
this an asian kid.
I mean this is not like some fucking 

5721
03:55:37,621 --> 03:55:38,680
white jock with a crew cut.
Like from back to the future,

5722
03:55:38,681 --> 03:55:39,580
we didn't say,
oh,

5723
03:55:39,581 --> 03:55:41,590
it's fucking biff.
Fuck him.

5724
03:55:41,591 --> 03:55:42,970
You know,
it waSn't that.

5725
03:55:43,000 --> 03:55:43,870
it was,
it was like,

5726
03:55:43,960 --> 03:55:46,930
it was really hard to label him as an 
oppressor,

5727
03:55:47,110 --> 03:55:52,110
but she still found a way and it was 
such an asian response to where he was 

5728
03:55:52,110 --> 03:55:52,110
just like,
I just want to do my job.

5729
03:55:52,110 --> 03:55:54,640
I don't want to be the center of this 
story at his camera,

5730
03:55:54,641 --> 03:55:56,310
up above his head,
you know,

5731
03:55:56,540 --> 03:56:01,540
I don't want to start a march.
This isn't like you have to get out of 

5732
03:56:01,540 --> 03:56:01,540
here.
He's like,

5733
03:56:01,540 --> 03:56:01,540
no,
I don't know.

5734
03:56:01,540 --> 03:56:02,410
This is my job.
I'm paid to be here.

5735
03:56:02,650 --> 03:56:04,900
I have to be.
You have a public thing going on here.

5736
03:56:04,960 --> 03:56:06,940
There's a protest after urinate.
So bad.

5737
03:56:06,970 --> 03:56:07,600
Don't do it,
dude.

5738
03:56:07,630 --> 03:56:08,250
Go do it.
You're gonna.

5739
03:56:08,270 --> 03:56:09,970
Keep doing the show now.
We'll wrap up.

5740
03:56:10,500 --> 03:56:11,920
Let's wrap up.
Let's wrap up.

5741
03:56:11,980 --> 03:56:14,080
Alright,
so as crowder on onto.

5742
03:56:14,081 --> 03:56:15,550
I'm glad we got through this dude.
No,

5743
03:56:15,560 --> 03:56:20,560
it was just a generous dude.
I really do like you fucked with you a 

5744
03:56:20,560 --> 03:56:22,090
little bit.
I treated you like a standup comedian.

5745
03:56:22,091 --> 03:56:25,060
I figured you'd fuck wiTh me back and 
you got a little four,

5746
03:56:25,090 --> 03:56:26,030
five.
we got through that.

5747
03:56:26,050 --> 03:56:27,530
Was that we got back.

5748
03:56:27,580 --> 03:56:28,550
We got through it.
Yeah.

5749
03:56:28,640 --> 03:56:31,090
We got listen seriously,
and for those listening,

5750
03:56:31,180 --> 03:56:36,180
honestly I won't say I don't because I 
don't want you to get in trouble if I 

5751
03:56:36,180 --> 03:56:36,940
say behind the scenes joe has done some 
things.

5752
03:56:36,941 --> 03:56:38,470
He's said something.
They've been very nice,

5753
03:56:38,680 --> 03:56:41,010
so he's a nice he,
you know.

5754
03:56:41,380 --> 03:56:46,380
Anyway,
I don't know if that hurts your street 

5755
03:56:46,380 --> 03:56:46,380
credit,
like,

5756
03:56:46,380 --> 03:56:46,380
no,
I don't have any bad credit.

5757
03:56:46,380 --> 03:56:46,380
I've zeros tree credit.
Well I like,

5758
03:56:46,380 --> 03:56:47,440
I have cats.
You have cats.

5759
03:56:47,441 --> 03:56:48,550
Have no street cred.
Dude.

5760
03:56:48,551 --> 03:56:51,400
I take yoga.
He's a good dude to folks.

5761
03:56:51,520 --> 03:56:53,050

We're going to be fun.

5762
03:56:53,100 --> 03:56:58,100
We're going to find a way.
