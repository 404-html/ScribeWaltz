1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,730
Trey my day,
Joe Rogan plot gas by night all day.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,180
No,
your life is very different right now.

3
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:09,010
That it was a year ago.
It is.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,630
How crazy is that?
Yeah.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,820
I like you.
A year ago you were talking about like

6
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:15,370
not doing this anymore.
I've got to figure out what I'm doing

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,830
and now you're the fucking world champ

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,330
about a frickin one 80.
Yeah.

9
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:25,550
Mike.
Mike career in life with it couldn't

10
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:27,590
have been different a year ago than it
is now.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,620
How strange is that?
How that can just like that in an

12
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:32,060
instant.
You just never know.

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,640
What does that feel like?
It's like when you wake up in the

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,473
morning,
you have to go,

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,640
okay,
I wake up this morning,

16
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,310
that's real.
P diddy

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,500
real.
I'm,

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,570
I'm happy.
It's,

19
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:46,040
um,
it's enlightening.

20
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:46,874
It's fun.
It's,

21
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,310
it's great to be the champ.
I love it.

22
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,140
Honestly.
It's a completely different thing.

23
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:51,711
And Yeah.
You know,

24
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:55,070
a year ago I was so frustrated because,
you know,

25
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:57,280
when I lost her onto the last time,
I knew I had a lot,

26
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,400
a long road,
you know,

27
00:00:58,401 --> 00:00:59,630
and to,
to work my way back up.

28
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:01,910
But I thought I had done that and when I
beat Jessica,

29
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:03,080
I,
it was announced like,

30
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:04,670
you know,
this is going to be then the number one

31
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:07,130
contender eliminator fight.
And then afterwards they're like,

32
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:08,960
yes it is.
You're going to fight Ronda.

33
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,110
Then I felt like the carpet was kind of
just pulled out from under my feet

34
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:13,400
because they're like,
just kidding.

35
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:14,380
Holly's,
you know,

36
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,400
holly's fighting.
And they announced it without telling

37
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:17,870
me.
So that's why I was so upset because I

38
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:19,310
was like,
I don't take that shit lightly,

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,210
you know?

40
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,950
Yeah.
Like I was training my ass off already.

41
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:24,530
I had already reached out to um,
a girl in France.

42
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,040
I can't say her name right.
I think it's like [inaudible],

43
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,840
I don't know some French name,
but she beat Ronda and judo.

44
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,890
So I had already like been making plans
with her to train with her and fire over

45
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:35,330
here and she was changing things.
Then I was like,

46
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,670
I feel like such an ass,
like I feel like an idiot.

47
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,220
Right.
They look like an idiot because here the

48
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:41,990
announcement was made and I didn't even
know.

49
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,150
So I was kind of upset about that.
But you know,

50
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:45,940
we talked about it and we smooth things
over and,

51
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,460
and I took it personally at the time,
but I don't think it was meant

52
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:52,100
personally and it was a business
decision and I understand that that at

53
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:55,130
the end of the day that's what it was
and it all worked out.

54
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:55,500
So

55
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,610
the UFC is in a weird position because
they're both a promoter and sort of a

56
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:00,860
sanctioning body.
Yup.

57
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,270
And that's really rare and matter of
fact,

58
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:05,280
I can't think of any other sport where
that exists.

59
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,980
Yeah.
You know,

60
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,970
they have just this ability to decide
like they'll dealt us decide like this

61
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,360
person gets a show.
Like the whole conor mcgregor situation

62
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:17,910
is a perfect example of that.
Like all of a sudden if he had beaten

63
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:21,850
nate diaz or if he had beaten dos Anjos
like dos Anjos didn't get injured and he

64
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:25,530
beat beat Dos Anjos you fucking know for
sure they were going to have him fight

65
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:26,460
Robbie lawler.
Yeah.

66
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,980
Like for sure.
And they were just going to like figure

67
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,860
out a way to do something with 145 Palm
Tata.

68
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,610
And why wouldn't they do it if they were
business people because that's where the

69
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:36,090
money is.

70
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,380
I mean it would've been if he had beat
those on Joe's and then when on and

71
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:44,340
fought Robbie law or Jesus Christ when
we talk to like a 5 million paper view

72
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:46,740
by event it,
they'd have to do it.

73
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,860
It would be insane.
But if that was like a sanctioning body,

74
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,680
like you've seen it before in like
boxing,

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,610
like someone won't take a mandatory
challenger and they get stripped even

76
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,650
when they just won the title,
it happens all the time.

77
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,930
Like we're a phytol would just win the
title and then they have this mandatory

78
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,760
challenger who nobody knows and they'll
go,

79
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:05,770
fuck that fight.
I'm going to go fight Canelo Alvarez,

80
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:08,200
I'm going to fight this guy or that guy.
And then he gets stripped.

81
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,850
Like,
cause there's like five different

82
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:12,430
sanctioning bodies.
Like boxing is way more of a mess.

83
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,570
So there's like pros and cons to doing
it the way the UFC does it.

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,490
But from a point of view of someone like
you,

85
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,640
it's probably much more frustrated.

86
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,550
Well,
you just never know what to expect.

87
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,800
Like you,
you get curve balls all the time in the

88
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:26,120
UFC.
Don't know what to expect.

89
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:28,460
You know,
like a lot of people were so pissed off

90
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:30,350
at me for,
for the Holly Holm,

91
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,050
not having the rematch right away,
but it's like,

92
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:34,850
it's not,
it's not my choice.

93
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,520
You know,
they have this of you,

94
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,900
I don't know,
cause they think that I like turned it

95
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:42,710
down or I should have went in there like
guns a blazing for holly and like put

96
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:43,790
myself out of my shield.
Like,

97
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,800
no,
we have to have the holly rematch.

98
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:47,210
You guys,
you don't understand.

99
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,010
But um,
yeah,

100
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:49,880
they call me up.
I'm like,

101
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,770
Amanda,
July 9th.

102
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,813
I'm like,
okay.

103
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,180
Yeah.
How did he notice UFC 200 how the fuck

104
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:57,620
do you say no,
no you don't.

105
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:02,180
You can't say no if that's what they
come up with you like I'm in and now you

106
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:02,690
know,
it's like,

107
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,320
dude,
relax.

108
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,480
Most people don't get immediate
rematches in their career.

109
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:07,690
Like,
unless you are conor mcgregor or Rhonda

110
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,001
or,
or you know,

111
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:11,930
someone that's really got a presence,
you don't get an immediate rematch.

112
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:14,270
Like I did when I went back and strike
force when,

113
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,770
when I lost to Ronda,
I didn't get into media.

114
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,450
I've never gotten immediate rematch.
My career,

115
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:19,880
I would love to immediately rematch cat
when I lost to her.

116
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:22,400
But you don't get it.
Sometimes you got to work your way back

117
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:24,170
up and you know,
hope for the best,

118
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:26,420
but we will.
I'm sure it will fight each other again.

119
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:30,950
She's fighting a volunteer mission.
Shanko now just say I have to laugh when

120
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:33,710
people say like that we're scared to
fight someone.

121
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,030
You know,
like people were like,

122
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,800
oh,
you're scared to fight holly again.

123
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,460
Like you can't listen to those people
are scared is not a relative.

124
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:43,070
Like it's not a term that I feel like
fighters really,

125
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,710
we don't,
we don't have scared the way normal

126
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,720
people have scared,
you know?

127
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,850
Yeah.
Like a normal person would be scared to,

128
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,160
to,
to get off their couch and go to the

129
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:52,851
gym,
you know,

130
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:53,990
to,
to spar or something.

131
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:54,950
Like,
that's what we do.

132
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:59,560
Like we live like what most people would
shit their pants to do on a day

133
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,100
fool to not know that it's a dangerous
fight.

134
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,010
So it's not a matter of not being aware
of the danger.

135
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,410
Yeah,
but it's a matter of managing the

136
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:11,770
consequences are like,
I think he did a fantastic job with the

137
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,590
holly fight,
like literally you did in that fight

138
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,350
other than the fifth round,
which is the most amazing part of it.

139
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,290
But you did everything.
Like when we were talking about like

140
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,090
what you have to do to beat her.
I'm like,

141
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:24,780
she's gotta stay on the outside.
You get a very her rhythm and she's got

142
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:28,120
to let holly come to her.
Like she can't rush in because if you

143
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:31,270
rush into holly,
it's like Russian into Machida are

144
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:34,540
rushing to anyone who's a great counter
striker and you saw the Rhonda fight.

145
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,560
Ronda just came bulldog and honor and
tried to out bulldogger and you just,

146
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,690
you can't do that with holly.
She's too fast.

147
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:43,600
Footwork to her,
her striking is so precise.

148
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,910
Her,
her counters are so clean and our

149
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:46,600
movements

150
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,630
very hard to read,
like it's very unpredictable.

151
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:52,660
I remember what a couple times I tried
to maybe come forward and get her to get

152
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:55,330
to the fence and I couldn't tell whether
she was going to jet out to the right to

153
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:56,270
the left.
Like she,

154
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:58,350
she's like two steps back left.
And I was like,

155
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,421
ah,
you know,

156
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:02,120
like I couldn't even tell like she had
gave no indication of which way she was

157
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:02,910
going to go.

158
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,850
Yeah.
Well you just did a fantastic job of

159
00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:08,520
varying,
your approach to your speed was

160
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:09,390
different.
Like you,

161
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:11,370
you,
you did a lot of fainting,

162
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,710
you varied things up a lot and you could
tell like,

163
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,950
she was like almost like waiting for
these moments to happen when you're

164
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:19,180
going to come forward and then you
wouldn't come forward.

165
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,360
And then it becomes like a test of
patience.

166
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,880
Like who's going to get outside of their
comfort zone?

167
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:25,940
Who's going to take chances?
Who's going to,

168
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:29,520
who's going to engage.
And she also has that weird stance too

169
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,150
when she kind of halfway stands like a
boxer and halfway stands like a karate

170
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:35,880
person.
She throws like a lot of sidekicks and

171
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:37,750
on the front leg techniques.
Yeah,

172
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,641
she's,
she's,

173
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:42,390
she's a tricky one but we put together a
really good game plan and I was happy

174
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:42,950
with that.

175
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,260
He did,
but it was the fifth round,

176
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,720
fifth round was crazy.
God,

177
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:52,170
when you grabbed a hold of her and then
eventually got her back and got her to

178
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:56,850
the ground,
it was so crazy because every aspect of

179
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,870
from your initial entrance to the take
down to getting her back,

180
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,560
there was nothing 100% about it.
It was all touch and go.

181
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:07,680
It was all scramble.
It wasn't like you had complete total

182
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:10,980
control over like maybe like Damien Maia
versus Rick Story.

183
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:12,960
Like he,
Damien Maia gets rick stories back.

184
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,380
He's got them locked up and then he
anacondas and squeeze some and then it

185
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:17,850
gets them.
It wasn't like that.

186
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:22,020
It was like you were fighting for your
fucking life and you knew there was no

187
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:23,310
time.
There was no time.

188
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:26,820
You were likely down by like at least
one round and you were headed into the

189
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,700
fifth and final round and maybe if you
won that round you could've got the

190
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:30,090
decision.

191
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,590
But fuck,
you're fighting the champ.

192
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,170
Who knows,
who knows what's going to happen.

193
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,800
You take our back and then when she
tries to shake you off the top and you

194
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:40,530
hang in there and you hang in there and
you see if you like,

195
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,090
and I would watch them like,
oh my God,

196
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:44,610
she's going to go out.
And when she went out and you climbed

197
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:47,340
off her and she was unconscious like
Holy Shit,

198
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,740
Holy Shit,
what a moment.

199
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,770
And I wasn't gonna ratable.
It was incredible.

200
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,510
It was one of the best moments in all of
women's championship fighting as far as

201
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,700
like,
like an extreme,

202
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,180
extremely dramatic moment where your,
you're trying to accomplish something.

203
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,030
She's fighting tooth and claw.
Neither one of you are exhausted.

204
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,250
So it's not like anyone's like
physically compromised.

205
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,280
It's just a fucking mad scramble between
two killers and you get her and you got

206
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:18,720
her back and then you get it back and
you'd sink the choking.

207
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:22,020
And she's trying to fucking shake you
off and you hung in the APP and when she

208
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:25,950
rolled and you're on top of her and you
hung onto it and you realize like,

209
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,870
oh my God,
she's going out.

210
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,640
And she just,
she didn't even tap,

211
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,510
she was throwing punches in the air
while you were choking her unconscious.

212
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,370
I think to myself,
I'm like,

213
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:37,530
when is she going to tap?
It didn't in my,

214
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,710
in that instinctual moment,
I'm so used to in training you get

215
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:42,080
people in a choke,
you know they tapped.

216
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:43,590
So I'm waiting for that tap and I'm
like,

217
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,170
good God.
Like when is this girl going to tap?

218
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:49,080
Like I know I've got,
or what does she hit tab and then,

219
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,230
then I felt her like I saw her,
you know,

220
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,160
from my peripherals kind of do,
do something.

221
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:55,680
I wasn't quite sure if she was tapping
or what she was until I watched the

222
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,870
video later and then I felt him pull me
off and I'm like,

223
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,160
that's the feeling that we fight for is
that feeling that that feeling of like I

224
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,170
did it,
I established my dominance.

225
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:04,841
You know,
it's a,

226
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:05,650
it's a,
you know,

227
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,280
it's a prideful sport in some ways,
you know,

228
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,080
hand to hand combat with someone else.
It's like,

229
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:10,560
you know,
I,

230
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,900
I did it tonight.
It was better.

231
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,730
It has to be prideful because otherwise
there's just certain sacrifices into

232
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,180
certain fires that you're just not going
to walk through.

233
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,640
Like you have to have every fucking
motivation.

234
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:24,040
You have to be Zahn,
but you also have to have an ego.

235
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:28,390
There's to be so many things going on.
If you do achieve that highest level of

236
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:30,870
greatness,
it's like walking on a tight rope,

237
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,050
you know?
Oh yeah,

238
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,800
we'll let her just like that perfect
balance.

239
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:35,780
You know,
I'm walking between buildings that are,

240
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,820
you know,
hundreds of stories high or,

241
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,410
you know,
and then it's like,

242
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,670
it's,
it's Kinda like that.

243
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:42,410
I mean,
you have to have the perfect balance and

244
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:44,810
everything has to meet perfectly.
And that moment,

245
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,640
including the training camp,
not overtraining.

246
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,840
Did you ever hear of that video that um,
the video is not that good,

247
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,430
but the audio is,
is awesome.

248
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:55,400
It's between the fourth and fifth round
and it's my corners.

249
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,680
What they're telling me between the
fourth and fifth round.

250
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,800
It's such an emotional video for me.
When I watched it,

251
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,850
it makes me relive that moment.
And Brian came in there and essentially

252
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:06,380
he was like,
Misha,

253
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:07,820
you've got to get,
after you got to,

254
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,160
you have got to put your chin down and
Mike Tyson,

255
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:11,900
this chick.
And that basically means just get after

256
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,270
her like get,
get in there,

257
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,450
get after it,
take the risk,

258
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,910
risk getting knocked out,
go for broke.

259
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,560
And um,
it goes,

260
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,270
you know,
plays into the round and,

261
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:23,000
and basically it was just telling me
like fucking Mike Tyson,

262
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,410
her like get after her,
you know,

263
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:25,910
bulldog or do whatever you've got to do.
He's like,

264
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:29,210
cause you're running out of time.
And I remember in that fifth round still

265
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,510
trying to get out of that,
that mindset of like,

266
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,540
I have to find the perfect opportunity.
I have to be patient because the whole

267
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,900
training camp was,
you know,

268
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,220
patient but persistent,
you know,

269
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:42,320
patient but persistent.
No one run into anything cause you,

270
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:43,790
you know you get caught,
you get knocked out,

271
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,930
you'll get need,
you'll get kicked,

272
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:47,390
you'll get punched.
So don't do that.

273
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:50,090
But you got to look for the,
the opening when it's the right timing.

274
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:53,030
It's all about timing.
And after I took her down in that second

275
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:57,110
round and I just beat her up that round,
she was so,

276
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,740
I'm so cautious and the third and fourth
and so perfect.

277
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,120
You know,
her game plan was perfect.

278
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:05,810
Do to beat me to stay just far enough
out of the range and keep me from not

279
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:08,540
wanting to come in.
I couldn't find a perfect opening,

280
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,090
couldn't like get in on anything.
There wasn't mistakes that she was

281
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:14,210
making and in the fifth round I just
decided,

282
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,640
you know,
you're going to have to,

283
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,830
you're going to have to take the chance
of getting knocked out.

284
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,780
This is,
this is what it's boiling down to now.

285
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,100
You've got like three minutes left on
the clock and now it's do or die.

286
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,260
It's either you go in there you,
you go for it,

287
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:29,810
you do Russian,
she catches you,

288
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,980
you get knocked out,
you know,

289
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,580
you gave it everything you got or you
got to make something happen.

290
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,460
You finish the fight.

291
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,220
The question was really like whether the
second round was a 10,

292
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:39,960
eight round,
uh,

293
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,670
on all three judges score cards.
It was,

294
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,740
yeah,
I mean watching it,

295
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,320
that's what the judges said.
Well it should have been but,

296
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,720
but what I'm,
what I meant was the question watching.

297
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:51,780
It was like I want like when we were,
when you were headed into the fifth

298
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:55,750
round with my question was was I wonder
if she got a ten eight round for that

299
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:58,340
second round because if she did then
this is like a,

300
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,000
this is an even fight.
So what's happening right now?

301
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:01,780
Like what,
where,

302
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,180
how the judge is looking at it going
into the fifth round.

303
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,610
It was even,
yeah.

304
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,600
Yeah.
That's crazy.

305
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,960
That was such a crazy moment.
Does another time.

306
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,340
The,
in doing the post fight interview were

307
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:13,360
almost crying like a bitch.

308
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,830
I get so emotional.
It was,

309
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,370
it was incredible.
He meets are hard to explain to someone

310
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:23,370
when you're there and you,
you um,

311
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,010
you get to see someone like you who's
worked so hard for something for so

312
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:28,390
long,
you know.

313
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,610
So when I said to you like,
how does that sound?

314
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,450
Like what does it sound like?
You're the new women's bantamweight

315
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:36,220
champion of the world.
Like what does that sound?

316
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,150
And you were just so overwhelmed.
It was so crazy.

317
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:42,730
Like just to be right next to you while
you were saying that and you said when

318
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:44,620
you said,
I'm waiting for you to say that for so

319
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:46,240
long.
It just crazy.

320
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,920
It was crazy moment.
It's crazy.

321
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,080
Yeah.
Cause I know what was,

322
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,450
what's crazy a tie about the mind and
the power of it.

323
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,700
I've,
I had visualized that moment so many

324
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:59,020
times that it felt like I was confused
in that it was hard for me to

325
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:02,210
distinguish that that was the real
moment I would go.

326
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,010
I would imagine it was so intense.
It was so surreal.

327
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,740
I would imagine my to this day it
probably seems fake.

328
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,680
Hat's really what it,
yeah.

329
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,490
Sometimes I have to go back and be like,
man,

330
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,200
that really did.
It really happened.

331
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,640
It really happened right there.
Oh,

332
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,770
it was topped Jay.
Thank yeah,

333
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,400
that excited.
If you had like if Auras were real,

334
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,760
you know like fucking,
if you had ci it was coming off your

335
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,380
body for sure.
We did a photo

336
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,970
falling over and been shaking papers,
cups,

337
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,460
foreign to the air and carpet would rip
gracious

338
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,710
moments in my life for sure.
I could only imagine you could only am,

339
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:48,880
I mean and anyone that watches that
sport,

340
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,750
that moment when you choked her out and
in the whole exchange of the fee.

341
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,370
Well even like that really the whole
fight because a fight is like,

342
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,460
I mean in a weird way,
I mean we call this martial arts and

343
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,260
there's a lot of people that have a
problem with that.

344
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,760
But in my mind that there is an art to
what you guys did in that fight.

345
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,450
And even what holly did,
because up until that fifth round,

346
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,320
I mean,
like you said,

347
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:14,560
especially the third and fourth,
she was doing what she wanted to do.

348
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,510
She was,
she was,

349
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,100
and there was a display going on,
there was like a,

350
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:21,550
there was a performance going on,
on top of this being a competition to

351
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:25,060
watch it as someone sitting there
watching it and calling it,

352
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:28,720
I mean this is a work of art and to have
it in that way,

353
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,030
it was,
it's such a masterful performance.

354
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,870
It was such a masterpiece moment.
And that to me is like one of the best

355
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:39,871
moments in mma because it's such a
fucking hard thing to achieve to become

356
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:43,090
a champion.
And for someone like you had tried and

357
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,240
tried again,
he won the title in strike force and

358
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:48,940
you're trying and trying again and
trying to make this happen and you know,

359
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:53,180
you think you're getting boxed out and
the Rhonda fight didn't happen after you

360
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:57,980
beat Jessica I and then all of a sudden
you have this opportunity and they comes

361
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,720
to together in one of the most powerful
ways we've ever seen inside the octagon.

362
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,553
It was amazing.

363
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,310
Well thank you.
That was a,

364
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,030
that was quite a great narration of
everything that's had to happen to make

365
00:15:10,031 --> 00:15:10,691
this come true.
You know?

366
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:11,381
And it,
it's,

367
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:12,640
uh,
it's crazy because,

368
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,430
um,
it was 10 the same month,

369
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,730
10 years,
the like the month,

370
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,680
um,
that I had had my first fight.

371
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,170
Wow.
It's been 10 years.

372
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:26,530
Yeah.
So it's crazy because you think 10 years

373
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:28,500
ago there wasn't even,
I mean,

374
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,060
women's MMA was a joke.
Like it was,

375
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:32,650
I mean,
no one to me it wasn't obviously,

376
00:15:32,651 --> 00:15:34,780
but to,
to most people it was a spectacle at

377
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:35,780
best.
Yeah.

378
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:37,870
Something they kind of threw on the card
is kind of like,

379
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,471
ah,
ha ha.

380
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:39,940
You know,
watch the chicks fight.

381
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:42,670
You know,
hopefully it'll pop out.

382
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,850
You know,
it's so true because they didn't respect

383
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:51,070
us as athletes.
You know?

384
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,060
That's,
that's what we,

385
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:53,000
that's,
that's the,

386
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,070
that's the honest truth.

387
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,680
That's the uphill battle that it was
like nobody took it seriously.

388
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:59,470
We didn't make any money.
We were fighting for breadcrumbs at

389
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:01,060
best.
I saw holly,

390
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,820
um,
once since densify and I was really

391
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:05,890
actually kind of nervous about it
because I was like,

392
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,090
she was,
um,

393
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,150
at the Jones osp fight,
those happen.

394
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,100
And,
um,

395
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:15,280
we were both of the VIP party and my
friend Heather Clark used to train

396
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:16,750
heather.
Joe Clark checks you fighting this

397
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,850
weekend and Rotterdam.
Anyways,

398
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,180
she was like,
you should go and talk to her.

399
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:20,501
I was like,
yeah,

400
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:21,250
I want to,
I just,

401
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,660
I don't want to come off like,
how,

402
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:24,430
what do I say?
What's up bitch?

403
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,780
Yeah.
Like what,

404
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,570
what do you say to someone that you
just,

405
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,370
you knew took the dog,
say hi.

406
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,810
That's what I did.
You know,

407
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:32,890
I just went up and was like,
you know,

408
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:33,470
how are you?

409
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,350
And she like,
she gave me,

410
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,193
I was,
she's like,

411
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,610
you know,
I'm just really bombed it in and get

412
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:37,421
that rematch.
And like,

413
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:37,961
I know,
I was like,

414
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:38,771
don't worry.
I was like,

415
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:40,120
well,
we'll see each other in the future.

416
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:40,954
She's like,
yeah.

417
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,800
She's like,
I hope so.

418
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:42,940
I just like,
I hope you still have it.

419
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:43,571
It's like,
you know,

420
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:45,020
I wanna,
I wanna,

421
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,510
uh,
you see you again in future.

422
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:47,260
I'm like,
yeah,

423
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,300
I totally get it.
I'm been in her shoes before.

424
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,310
I know how bad that sucks.
And she wants that back.

425
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,750
But you know,
we were friendly,

426
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,190
but it's amazing how both of you are so
nice.

427
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:57,560
Like holly's one of the nicest people.
Nice.

428
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,450
She's such a sweetheart.
[inaudible] Nice.

429
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,180
If you didn't know she was a fighter,
he be like no fucking way.

430
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,900
And then you find out she's a 19 time
world boxing champion.

431
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,470
Be like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

432
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,570
How's that possible?
How's that Nice Lady?

433
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:09,890
A a killer.
Yeah.

434
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,580
Some tomfoolery doesn't make any sense.
Like,

435
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,190
and she doesn't fit the mold either.
Like both of you guys are really

436
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:20,960
interesting representatives of MMA and
great representatives because you break

437
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:21,750
that mold.

438
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,220
You know a fan of her manager though.
Oh yeah.

439
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,780
Who is your why?
I don't know.

440
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:27,310
I don't even know if I've ever met him
in person.

441
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:28,720
I probably haven't.
Maybe I have.

442
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,950
If I did,
it wasn't memorable.

443
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,180
But anyways,
um,

444
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,410
I guess he went like Dana went down.
So Tina Dana told me this,

445
00:17:35,411 --> 00:17:39,040
Dana went down to albuquerque before
this fight ever came together of her and

446
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:39,874
I,
right.

447
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,920
And he said,
look,

448
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,740
you guys need to wait for Rhonda.
Trust me.

449
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,600
That's the big money fight.
That's a fight.

450
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:47,860
You want to wait for it.
He went down there.

451
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:48,641
He told me,
this is my face.

452
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:51,260
He went down to tell them,
don't fight me,

453
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,540
tate,
like they didn't want to give me the UC

454
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,210
did not want that fight to happen.
Right.

455
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,190
They wanted,
you know,

456
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,960
the,
the rematch to be the first fight.

457
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,480
And Holly's manager told him,
we want me Shantae and Dana said he

458
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,400
threw up his hands and was like,
are you fucking kidding me?

459
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:06,750
He's like,
she's been the baddest,

460
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,820
you know,
other than Ronda for years now.

461
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,720
And you want to take her lightly.
You think you're just gonna walk there?

462
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:12,481
He's like,
yeah,

463
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:13,440
we got this.
Like,

464
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:15,130
she's going to be a tune up fight.
Who's your manager?

465
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,470
I don't even know his name.
I don't know these 80 but he told Dana

466
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:21,420
that,
that they,

467
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,760
that they thought that I was going to be
a tune up fight.

468
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,770
[inaudible].
