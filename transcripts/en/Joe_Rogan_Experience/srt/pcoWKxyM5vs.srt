1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:03,700
Oh,

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,000
this is a period where I was doing
a lot of psychedelics and one of the

4
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:09,240
experiences you've probably
had on psychedelics is the,

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,430
the amazing experience of just looking
into someone's eyes on acid or mushrooms

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:19,431
and just having that just open a kind
of inner landscape of profundity you're

7
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:21,540
seeming profundity where you're just,

8
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:21,691
you know,

9
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:25,410
you can just be staring into someone's
eyes silently for an eternity or what

10
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:26,370
seems like an eternity.

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,110
And um,

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,630
what often happens to people is that
after having experiences like this,

13
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,300
then looking into people's eyes
can become a way of really,

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,481
uh,

15
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:36,730
of,

16
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,260
of,

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,900
kind of activating that
state of mind where,

18
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:40,250
you know,

19
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,880
you just being committed to looking into
people's eyes and never looking away

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,070
can be a way of sort of introducing that
sort of liquid psychedelic experience,

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,281
you know,

22
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:50,941
interpersonally.

23
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,550
And I was sort of into that to,

24
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,300
to uh,

25
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:54,970
uh,

26
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,650
uh,

27
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,050
for a while and um,

28
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,230
uh,

29
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,850
so I was kind of walking through life,

30
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:00,500
you know,

31
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:00,980
like,

32
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,050
like a Tom cruise does basically.

33
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,073
Yeah,

34
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:05,910
exactly.

35
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,120
Just never just like,

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,391
oh,

37
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:08,240
I'm just going to go with it.

38
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,040
Let's see where this goes and I'm just
never going to look away from anyone ever

39
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:11,874
again.

40
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,830
And you get.

41
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,731
You start having,

42
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:16,800
I mean it's intrusive
and I stopped doing it,

43
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,300
but you,

44
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,490
you start having unusual experiences.

45
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:23,580
The first thing you do is you discover
everyone else is doing that for whatever

46
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:23,910
reason.

47
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,730
So all of the psychopaths and
the scientologists and all,

48
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,000
everyone comes out of the woodwork because
there there's some number of people

49
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,950
walking around earth at this moment who
are playing that game who are just all.

50
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:39,420
It's like you look into their eyes and
it's just I lock for as long as you're

51
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:44,010
going to stay and they're never gonna
look away and so whether it's a Barista at

52
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:46,710
starbucks or whether it's
just somebody who is,

53
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:46,920
you know,

54
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,490
50 feet across the room at a
party and you make eye contact,

55
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,860
they're not going to be
the first one to look away.

56
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,290
And so you get into these
really weird encounters.

57
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:55,861
And I had this.

58
00:01:55,861 --> 00:02:00,360
I remember this one party I went to where
I was sitting on a couch and I looked

59
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:02,970
across the room and there was
this guy looking at me and I

60
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,530
probably,

61
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,000
you know,

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,680
40 feet between us and he looked at me
and I looked at him and then it was just

63
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:15,681
like war of the warlocks know neither
of us were going to look away.

64
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:16,410
Right.

65
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,370
And it just be that.

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,640
And I was doing a lot of
meditation and I was uh,

67
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:20,951
you know,

68
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:21,230
I had,

69
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,380
it was probably uh,

70
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,850
uh,

71
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,440
taking acid once a month,

72
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:25,741
you know,

73
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:26,370
so I was,

74
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,280
I was pretty tuned up for this kind
of game where it's just like a,

75
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:29,650
you know,

76
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,660
I was not,

77
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,480
I had no problem with making eye
contact with some strange guy,

78
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:33,661
you know,

79
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:34,494
40 feet away.

80
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,543
Um,

81
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,940
and after a certain point he jumped up
and kind of raced over to me and know we

82
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,060
had a problem.

83
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,301
He's like,

84
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:43,290
what the fuck are you doing?

85
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:43,480
And,

86
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:43,790
and,

87
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,360
and it was like a real,

88
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,790
is what I was doing was so intrusive.

89
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,960
But he,

90
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,820
he had his own game going because he,

91
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,301
you know,

92
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,440
he didn't look away,

93
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,274
right?

94
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,210
He was available for it.

95
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,920
But in any case when you
walk through life like this,

96
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,230
you discover that there are a
lot of people doing this for,

97
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,240
for whatever reason.

98
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:04,600
And it's,

99
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,433
it's a.

100
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,270
You definitely have unusual encounters.

101
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,471
Hello Joe,

102
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,320
for Fuck Sake.

103
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,290
Look at you sitting up
there and your high.

104
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,320
He asked me if I was David Letterman
and tell everybody about this chair.

105
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,840
This is my latest device to try to
mitigate back pain from sitting.

106
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,950
And it's called the,

107
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,440
I think it's called a sally.

108
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,220
Yeah.

109
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,090
[inaudible] s a l l I.

110
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,680
and it's a saddle chair.

111
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,970
It's like a saddle.

112
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,430
So if you see how it's sitting here at.

113
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:29,800
No,

114
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,000
no one's endorsing this.

115
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,790
I'm just telling you it feels
I'm going to tell you this.

116
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,220
They would hate me endorsing
this because it feels like shit.

117
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,770
It's like the least comfortable
chair I think I've ever sat at.

118
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,570
But it's very good for your
back and make sure you like,

119
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,530
you can't sit any way
other than like this.

120
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,930
Like you have to sit straight up,

121
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,900
you can't slouch in this thing.

122
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:52,900
It just doesn't support it.

123
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,560
And when I sit in a regular
chair by the end of the podcast,

124
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,630
my fucking neck starts to hurt my back.

125
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:00,550
Like around here where I've been injured,

126
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,713
starts to hurt.

127
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,600
Like stretch your asshole out though.

128
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,100
And like give that to I'm trying to do.

129
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,330
It's easier for me if I ever
do wind up going in the pokey.

130
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,390
I want to be just gaping soon.

131
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:13,780
Um,

132
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,021
no,

133
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,100
it doesn't do anything in your asshole.

134
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:15,934
You fucking idiot.

135
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,490
You're sitting now.

136
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,320
It's like,

137
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,950
I know this is,

138
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,823
you're not listening.

139
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,780
The whole idea behind this is,

140
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:23,680
it's like a saddle.

141
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,551
If you sit in the saddle,

142
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:26,470
you actually kind of have
to hold yourself in place.

143
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,540
So by squeezing your legs together,

144
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,190
it's not opening your butthole.

145
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,110
You're actually squeezing
everything tight.

146
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,930
So if you were a girl and you
wanted to have one of these,

147
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,880
I figured it would probably
be good for the ova.

148
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:37,360
Jj.

149
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,620
Probably tighten that baby up.

150
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,100
Like women are supposed to like
do those key not supposed to.

151
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,881
Supposed to.

152
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:44,650
If they care about trivia penis correctly,

153
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,484
what their vagina,

154
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,720
they do those Qigong exercises
where you squeeze your vagina,

155
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,020
you can actually make it stronger.

156
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,830
There's some crazy bitch and Russia that's
like the world record holder for the

157
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,510
amount of weight she can
carry where they're posting,

158
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,360
but it's something
substantial like 50 pounds.

159
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,120
So she shoves a Dildo in her pussy,

160
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,090
attaches it to a fucking
Kettlebell and uh,

161
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:06,320
and does squats holding this,

162
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,500
this Dildo in her,

163
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,440
in her box,

164
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,930
just with their shield pushing back,

165
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,650
like grabbing it like that.

166
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,850
Is anybody else getting hungry?

167
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,723
Yeah.

168
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,390
I don't know why I'm getting peckish
you ever hear honeysuckle divine?

169
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,440
Yes.

170
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:20,770
Yeah.

171
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,980
The one that used to shoot ping pong
balls and neither tuna fish sandwich.

172
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,120
No.

173
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,901
Where was that at?

174
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:26,580
Where did she do?

175
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,011
She did it.

176
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:29,830
The truck are there in Philadelphia
because it was like we were kids.

177
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,180
It was like this big joke
about only stuck with the law.

178
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,340
But uh,

179
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,490
I was up at the rib and they were
shooting a porn and you know,

180
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:38,260
these porn girls need so much attention.

181
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,570
Obviously they didn't
have anything else to do.

182
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,860
And the more conversation,

183
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,661
so one girl sits in,

184
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:43,870
the bullet goes do your trick,

185
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,310
you know the,

186
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,490
the container,

187
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:50,200
their scores put in jams
and she just pops it out.

188
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,860
But she paid.

189
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,090
She hit the grill too hard.

190
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:52,924
It was so funny.

191
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,000
Girls faces there and you go boom.

192
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,380
He's getting the girl goes fuck

193
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,120
big red mark on her face and explained
that she can shoot it out of her pussy.

194
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:02,990
So hard it her.

195
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,853
Yeah,

196
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,880
I can see you doing it.

197
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,080
Vince is fucking up.

198
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,640
Really needs to make you a part of it.

199
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,040
I told Tony when immediately you should
do it and I can't believe you didn't

200
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:16,160
take it Tony because that is the way
one of the biggest things for you or for

201
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:21,161
you because you are that are trying to
negotiate doing it part time from La.

202
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,270
That would be awesome.

203
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,920
That would be best for both sides because
I wouldn't get burned out on it and

204
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,080
they would have awesome,

205
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:33,210
great ideas that are hip and cool and I
would have been able to do what I want

206
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,073
the pimping cool.

207
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,050
Whenever guy says,

208
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,550
my ideas are hip and cool,

209
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,443
I'll go,

210
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,281
are you sure?

211
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:38,711
It depends.

212
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:41,410
What ideas these talking
about her as a scarf.

213
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,463
Scarf.

214
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,540
It's a scarf with little
skulls all over it.

215
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,470
Like he's a pirate.

216
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,280
He's drinking a Frappaccino

217
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,580
fuck yes.

218
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,430
Undertaker has gone.

219
00:06:58,431 --> 00:06:59,264
Metro,

220
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,270
Metro sexual undertaker.

221
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,320
Maybe if you changed,

222
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,060
all of a sudden Tony starts working for
them and every character becomes gay as

223
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:10,251
good.

224
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:10,550
Again,

225
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,760
it turns out that there's.

226
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,380
There's someone who's
sprinkling gay dust overall.

227
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,380
The other competitors,

228
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:18,670
whether they're in the locker room,

229
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,991
he's turning.

230
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:20,351
That's the.

231
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:21,650
That's a plot that Tony comes up.

232
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,530
He turns the entire roster,

233
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:24,364
gay.

234
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,450
It turns out there's an openly gay
wrestler and he has gay fairy dust.

235
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:28,910
Okay.

236
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,050
Was he didn't like a
leprechauns ball sack,

237
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,470
killed the Leprechaun and turned
his ball sack until like this.

238
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,520
Are you ready for this?

239
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,300
What if I were to tell you that there is
an openly gay wrestler that blows dust

240
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:44,620
in people's spaces.

241
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,050
His name is gold dust.

242
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,400
No fucking way.

243
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,610
There he is right there.

244
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,380
Dude.

245
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,710
This is in the wwe.

246
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,511
Dustin Rhodes,

247
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:56,940
a third generation wrestler.

248
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,060
What's going on with his Dick?

249
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,210
That's gold dust power.

250
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,970
David.

251
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,040
You've heard of horsepower that's
related to the dusty roads?

252
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,650
Yeah.

253
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,020
Yeah.

254
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,550
How did you know about Dusty Rhodes?

255
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,583
Eight.

256
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,970
This guy's real pleased.

257
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,930
I need to see more.

258
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:19,090
I can't believe I invented
a guy that already exists.

259
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,790
You should be writing this.

260
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,730
That's him insurance outfit.

261
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,000
When he takes off the wagon robe and he

262
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,920
flirts with them in the ring and Shit
blows kisses and they get all riled up and

263
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:34,770
then he can beat him with
shit because they're like,

264
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:35,280
oh,

265
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,230
not gay.

266
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,091
Get away from me.

267
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:37,570
And he's like,

268
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,020
oh yeah,

269
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,420
come here.

270
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,250
Beautiful.

271
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,520
And they're lying to the wwe should hire
Michael Sam as soon as he's done with

272
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:42,880
the data

273
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,713
cowboys.

274
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,990
He's the openly gay nfl player.

275
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,670
I don't know.

276
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,020
He's not good enough to make the team it.

277
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:51,520
Just bring them for the practice squad.

278
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,190
They need to bring that dude into
wwe and actually fuck a guy on TV.

279
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,000
Well,

280
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,170
him and gold dust,

281
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,550
but gold does is faking it.

282
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:00,000
I could tell.

283
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,331
Look it up.

284
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:00,961
My Guy Straight.

285
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:01,141
Yeah,

286
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,190
he's super straight.

287
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,810
Is super straight.
