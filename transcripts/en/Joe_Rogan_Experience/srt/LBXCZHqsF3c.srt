1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,790
We give zero fucks.

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:03,860
Your Ratha drove,

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,600
rode to the experience.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,130
Do you know that that was Sarah Palin?

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,530
She said that Sarah Pailin
had a conversation with a
librarian and was Cilla

6
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:18,030
Alaska where she said that on the
Internet there was a photograph of,

7
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:20,700
of human footprint inside
of dinosaur footprint.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,751
And the woman,

9
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,780
like the woman like talked about this
and Sarah Palin was running for president

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,191
or vice president,

11
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:26,880
whatever.

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,661
And she was like,

13
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,494
what?

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,120
Pause the

15
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,453
fuck.

16
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,050
Like this is a woman that got that a
heartbeat away from being the president.

17
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:40,620
And she thought she thought that
dinosaurs and humans walk together

18
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,210
and then you see people
who are intelligent.

19
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:43,421
Yeah.

20
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:45,360
We'll get that pee pill that down.

21
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,890
Brian claim dinosaurs of people coexist
and amazing cause it say they're about

22
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:50,730
the librarian.

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,790
Yeah.

24
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,103
Um,

25
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,010
yeah,

26
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,550
whatever.

27
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:55,851
Well,

28
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:56,930
and I think that,

29
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,764
um,

30
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:58,341
uh,

31
00:00:58,341 --> 00:00:59,180
what's the other one?

32
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,530
I'm not Sarah Palin.

33
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,190
Yeah.

34
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:02,970
Michele Bachman.

35
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,290
Michele Bachmann's worse.

36
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,580
Well her husband's Gay,

37
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,150
right?

38
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,701
Is Gay,

39
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,171
is gay.

40
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:07,950
As Gay,

41
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,360
as gay as the day is beautiful and long
and flower smell pretty and butterflies

42
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:12,901
are beautiful.

43
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:13,630
That guy's gay.

44
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,250
I let you,

45
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,750
he can suck enough dick.

46
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,591
There's no way.

47
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:18,690
If you could just just
give him a free pass.

48
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,600
If you ever got that guy liquored up
and put a heart on in front of him,

49
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,800
he would jump on it.

50
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,830
Like Greg Louganis off the
top peer swan dive on that.

51
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,860
His head would be spinning a out of a
gain and he'd still get some tongue on the

52
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:33,220
shaft.

53
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,820
He would automatically start salivating
to the point where it was like a

54
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:41,350
waterfall coming out of his
mouth pouring down his shirt.

55
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,980
Just so alive.

56
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,473
Long story,

57
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,010
you would know where the pool started
and the saliva for Dick starts coming out

58
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:49,370
of it.

59
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,700
Yeah,

60
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,530
it would literally be like
a saliva waterfall and like
when not when people have

61
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,810
a backyard and they
have those really like,

62
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,970
like fancy little rock formations where
the water comes down into their pool.

63
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:03,320
If you're really fancy schmancy.

64
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:04,154
That was his mouth.

65
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,401
Yeah.

66
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:04,910
If he,

67
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,170
he would say to a young man,

68
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:07,760
do you want to go in the hot tub with me?

69
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,481
And the guy would go,

70
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:08,901
okay,

71
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,220
they'd get in the hot
tub and the guy we go,

72
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,480
there's no water in here,

73
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,343
and he'd go,

74
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,243
just wait,

75
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,740
let me see your cock

76
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,010
warm and gooey.

77
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:20,660
It's comes out 96 degrees.

78
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,540
I'd let them blow me if I knew that
I could take down Michelle Bachmann

79
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,171
particular down.

80
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:27,930
From what though?

81
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,560
Just because she will
be an elected leader.

82
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:31,394
Joe,

83
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,181
you really feel that?

84
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:33,020
I know.

85
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:33,531
So lucky.

86
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:38,360
You just have to see who fox news is
trotting out and she is one of the first

87
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:40,640
pundits they go to for comments on shit.

88
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,930
She is introducing legislation in
Congress right now that is actually being

89
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:45,764
enacted.

90
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,750
So what's the stopper?

91
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,500
Me,

92
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,230
I will suck her husband's
deck and release it on the,

93
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:51,980
on the Internet.

94
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,813
I'll take the hit.

95
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,570
All we need to do is

96
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,710
get them on some ecstasy.

97
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,280
Right?

98
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,560
Just get them to realize
the folly of his ways.

99
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,070
It's like these people that are like that.

100
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:03,490
I guarantee you if you got them on
some ecstasy and gave him a hug and go

101
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:05,410
fucking don't worry about it man.

102
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,670
Don't worry about it.

103
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,870
I know who you are.

104
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,040
Just let it go be.

105
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:09,940
You don't,

106
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,310
don't be gobble,

107
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:12,881
gobble,

108
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:13,630
gobble.

109
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:13,970
Yeah.

110
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,900
Just grabbing them and stuffing them in.

111
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,880
This Steph it ed party up.

112
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:18,211
Dude,

113
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:19,320
you're already like 60.

114
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,690
He's probably actually probably
having a lot of gay sex.

115
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:23,940
He's just not telling her dad
he's having a lot of gay sex.

116
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:25,950
And I think it's similar
with a lot of celebrities.

117
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:27,720
I don't want to mention
names like say Oprah,

118
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,160
like her husband,

119
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,300
I believe.

120
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:30,990
How dare you?

121
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,210
I believe um,

122
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,420
eats.

123
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,440
I've heard rumors.

124
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:36,270
He always have to
substantiate things like that.

125
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:38,340
I've heard rumors that
he looks extremely gay.

126
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:38,910
To me.

127
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,520
I would say those rumors automatically.

128
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,330
Um,

129
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,360
if I knew that there was a woman
out there or a man out there,

130
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:48,600
brother whose girlfriend
makes $100 billion,

131
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,710
I would say that guy's gay,

132
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:50,750
right?

133
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,990
Fucking right out of the gate.

134
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,900
Your Dick would get so small from being
around that much money every day and

135
00:03:56,901 --> 00:03:57,734
it's not yours.

136
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,580
She is so dominant over him.

137
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:00,420
And what does that guy do?

138
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:01,560
Is you make a hundred grand a year.

139
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:01,861
I mean,

140
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:03,030
who knows what the fuck he does.

141
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,730
I think he goes out and does well,

142
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,121
here's,

143
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,250
here's the cash in for
doing nothing is the,

144
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:12,251
he does speeches like they pay him to
come in and do motivational speeches.

145
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,080
Oh God.

146
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:14,690
Yeah.

147
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,650
Oh my God.

148
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,750
That's hilarious.

149
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,280
Motivational speeches.

150
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:18,880
Yeah,

151
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,080
whatever you would do.

152
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,650
This is how you find a really which
powerful woman and just connect to her.

153
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,980
That's [inaudible] people look,

154
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,451
who knows?

155
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:29,830
Maybe the guys are really brilliant,

156
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:30,461
intelligent guy.

157
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:31,750
Maybe it doesn't give a fuck about money.

158
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:32,740
Maybe he's just enlightened.

159
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,221
No,

160
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:33,641
it's true.

161
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,001
Actually.

162
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,500
I know dudes that are like that,

163
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:39,070
that are with really strong women
and they are totally cool with it.

164
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:39,640
They,

165
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,260
they find them and you know,

166
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:44,410
and chanting and humorous
and they go for the ride.

167
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,131
That's fine.

168
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:47,710
I guess for us we're kind of Alpha males,

169
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,190
so I think it would be difficult for
us to picture of being in the backseat

170
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,530
maybe and maybe not.

171
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,520
I think there's,

172
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,960
it's really hard when you say like
that this would work or that would work

173
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:02,460
generalizing because there's people in
my life that on paper I shouldn't like

174
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:02,880
hmm.

175
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,080
And I fucking love them.

176
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,000
You know what I mean?

177
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,970
This relationships that I've had with
people that despite all the craziness,

178
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,120
I enjoyed the fuck out of my
time with them and you know,

179
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:14,130
and sometimes in a more intense way,

180
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,600
even though it wasn't like,

181
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,390
it wasn't anything that had legs
like they could actually lasts.

182
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:18,511
Like,

183
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:22,290
cause after a while you have
real relationships where
you could actually go on

184
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,220
vacation with someone.

185
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:23,700
Right.

186
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,400
Do you remember when you first started
going vacation with girlfriends and like

187
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:28,110
three or four days and you're like,

188
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,610
oh my God,

189
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:32,070
I need a jump out of a fucking window now.

190
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,580
Right?

191
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:32,851
Oh,

192
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:35,580
I had a girl that I faked a phone call.

193
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,660
My friend called me up.

194
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:38,730
I faked an obligation to get rid of her.

195
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,280
She came to stay with me for the weekend,

196
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:46,281
just for the weekend and two days in she
was complaining about everything to the

197
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:48,840
point where it's was like
there was no fun to be had.

198
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,550
Everything was just a complaint,

199
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,200
complaining about the music,

200
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,060
complaining about where
we're going to go to eat,

201
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,400
complaining about every fucking thing.

202
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:56,990
And it was,

203
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,070
I was panicking.

204
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:59,560
My friend called me up and,

205
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:00,110
and I,

206
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,501
and I go,

207
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:00,651
hey,

208
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,430
what's up man?

209
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,790
And I go,

210
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,690
oh dude,

211
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,220
I forgot shit.

212
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:04,671
Fuck,

213
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:05,930
I got to come get you all.

214
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,381
My God,

215
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:07,214
I'm so sorry.

216
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,740
This is my friend Johnny
who's quite a slit character.

217
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:10,040
It was like,

218
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,251
oh,

219
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:10,660
I can it.

220
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,121
What's going on?

221
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:11,491
What's going on?

222
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:12,324
What are you doing over there?

223
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,423
And I go,

224
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,383
Bethany's here.

225
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:14,961
Shit.

226
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:15,794
Is that her name?

227
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,633
Damn.

228
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,110
A nice person.

229
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,960
But it was the wrong time for both of us.

230
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,371
Look,

231
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,170
I was a fucking pain in the ass then too.

232
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,580
That was part of the problems.

233
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,570
Like I was a fucking,

234
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,660
I think that's it too.

235
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:29,520
I think that when you're a young man,

236
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,700
I think it'd be hard for you to travel
with anybody but other young men,

237
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:33,181
you just,

238
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:34,710
you are a fucking explore.

239
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,340
You want to really go nuts and

240
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:36,780
yeah.

241
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,421
Not only that,

242
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:38,290
you're dumb.

243
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:38,830
Yeah.

244
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,331
I was 20,

245
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:40,121
I was 24,

246
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:41,560
I think it was maybe 23 at the time.

247
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,060
I was so stupid.

248
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:43,390
Yeah.

249
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,890
I mean it was so sick and crazy and it
was doing me like two years removed from

250
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:48,724
fighting.

251
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,420
So my brain was hardwired the wrong way.

252
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:53,820
Like I had to rewire it.

253
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,030
My brain was,

254
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,410
was wired for violent competition
and then breaks in between that.

255
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,730
Like that was my whole life.

256
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:06,030
So going from that to like the like
being around girls and relationships and

257
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:09,800
trying to manage those waters was
very confusing for me because,

258
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,190
but fighting was such
like a solitary pursuit.

259
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:13,024
Right.

260
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,083
I had a,

261
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,470
I used to keep journals,

262
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:15,950
uh,

263
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,230
up until probably when I
was like 23 or something,

264
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,950
but I was dating this girl and
we went to Europe together.

265
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,630
Uh,

266
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,730
it was like after Sophomore Year
of college that summer she had,

267
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:26,990
she had studied abroad in,

268
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,210
in Austria for the second semester.

269
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:33,290
So I saved us some cash and I flew over
there and we met in London and we went

270
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:38,291
to Ireland and we went to France and I
was fucking miserable and I was keeping a

271
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:41,720
journal and I look back at
it now and it wasn't her,

272
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,070
it was just that like I just
wanted to do my own fucking thing.

273
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:50,270
I wasn't into negotiating and compromising
because at that age you feel like

274
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,230
life is so short,

275
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:53,270
you don't want to waste a day.

276
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:55,910
You just feel like whatever
the most exciting thing is,

277
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,170
that's what you want to be doing.

278
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,990
And that's often not what
comes out in the copy.

279
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,210
There's definitely that.

280
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:01,901
But this is also,

281
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:03,130
I was just selfish.

282
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,610
Yeah.

283
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,230
I didn't want to do what anybody else.

284
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:06,730
Well I think that's
what we're both saying.

285
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,620
I mean,

286
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,730
but it wasn't even that I was thinking,

287
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:09,971
Hey,

288
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:10,870
life is short.

289
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,160
It wasn't a romantic,

290
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,110
it was like totally egotistical.

291
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,340
You know?

292
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,300
Like if you look back,

293
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:19,960
like if you had to go back in time and
be yourself when you were 23 or 22 years

294
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:20,330
old,

295
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,300
like what a fucking mess that would be.

296
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,320
Like you'd be like,

297
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,921
ah,

298
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,430
what do I have to deal with?

299
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:25,750
Yeah.

300
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,021
You know,

301
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:28,330
you would like look at the
relationships that you'd try to manage.

302
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:32,410
Like what the fuck mess you created and
that you're just such a different human

303
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,460
now than you were then.

304
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,130
You spend so much energy
on relationships back then.

305
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,440
I'll tell you man,

306
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,090
having like a relationship,

307
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,051
like a special,

308
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:46,051
like when you were 16 the amount
emotionally I grew from like 16 to like 18

309
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,160
which was during the term that
I had this girl as a girlfriend.

310
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,810
She was a very nice person too.

311
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,673
She was,

312
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,820
she was not a mean nasty in any way,

313
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,470
which was really nice as well.

314
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,360
Like I dated some girls after that were,

315
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:03,930
they were mean and nasty and when it
will first time a girl in salt you,

316
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,710
it's like,

317
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,820
it's a weird thing,

318
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:06,270
you know,

319
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,350
because like sh this.

320
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:09,060
My first girlfriend never would do that.

321
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:12,540
She was very smart as well and
like we would have conversations,

322
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,940
they were interesting conversations,

323
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,540
but there was no manipulation.

324
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,374
There's no weirdness.

325
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,800
And then I dated this girl about a
year later that was the opposite.

326
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,000
She was very nice.

327
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,990
She was very pretty unfortunately for
her because it gave her this fucking,

328
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,070
this ability to list constantly have
men around her constantly have people

329
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:29,670
hitting on her.

330
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,790
But she knew how to fuck with you
and like you would see it happened.

331
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,770
She would say something like he
was your nose always that crooked.

332
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,710
And I was just going to what?

333
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,181
Like,

334
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,014
I don't know.

335
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,950
And then I remember thinking,

336
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,240
what the fuck was that like,

337
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,990
Ooh,

338
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,920
what's going on here?

339
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,160
Yeah.

340
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,390
She would say shit like that.

341
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,860
Like all the time,

342
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,923
you know?

343
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,801
Yeah.

344
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:51,490
Weird Shit.

345
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,160
And that's where you see
bad marriages is when,

346
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,960
when either person and salts,

347
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:57,040
the other one it's like,

348
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:57,641
unless it's,

349
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:58,630
you really get that,

350
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,240
that's their stack and they fuck
around and bust each other's balls.

351
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:01,630
Right.

352
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,940
But when you see the guy get a little bit,

353
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,080
you know,

354
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,100
damaged by it,

355
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:07,540
you just think God,

356
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,523
ah,

357
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,090
the

358
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,660
girl,

359
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,950
the girl getting damaged out of it,

360
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:15,540
he has even more like tension because
there's a physical violence worry,

361
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,111
you know,

362
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:18,990
obviously you know women
do violence on men.

363
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:21,900
I mean I lost a very good friend and
Phil Hartman for that very thing.

364
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:26,580
His wife shot him while I was in his
sleep and that was a horrible relationship

365
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,790
and that was a relationship where his
ex wife used to do subtle shit to insult

366
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:34,260
him in front of large groups of people.

367
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,640
Like she would chew chip him down because
she was a failed actress and you know,

368
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:39,510
Phil was a superstar,

369
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:40,570
was coming up Saturday night live.

370
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,350
He's constantly movies and you know,

371
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,363
he was just a,

372
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,860
well like a deeply loved guy.

373
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,360
And so she would take,

374
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,110
he would take her to parties and she
would take that opportunity to assault him

375
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,131
in front of people,

376
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,570
like in real subtle ways like acuity.

377
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,910
We're talking about cars because Phil was
like a car nut and he bought a Ferrari

378
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,860
and he was so happy he bought this car.

379
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,740
Like he saved up his money and
he's like a big deal for him.

380
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:05,431
He saved his money,

381
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,430
made from a couple of movies and he
always wanted one of these things.

382
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,930
And the way he would talk about it,

383
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:11,850
like he was a very interesting guy,

384
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,511
very,

385
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,201
very smart,

386
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:16,140
smoked weed and it would get
like real crazy about shit,

387
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:19,920
like really into things and have these
wild conversations and like kid who's a

388
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:20,311
really,

389
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:21,660
like he loved things.

390
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:23,160
He loved becoming a pilot.

391
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,070
Like he became a pilot while
we were doing news radio.

392
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:29,640
And I remember seeing them sitting there
like studying due to flee all these

393
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:30,630
aviation books.

394
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,430
I'm way to add for that,

395
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:32,641
right?

396
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:35,640
But this guy would study
and like his lines,

397
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:36,660
like when we had a scene,

398
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:39,430
he would study his lines over
and over and over and over.

399
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,360
And he was sitting like a consummate
professional and Lee Scott.

400
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,190
So when he was talking about this Ferrari,

401
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:48,390
it was about the Italian engineering
and the shape of it and the sound of the

402
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:48,880
engine.

403
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,110
The whole experience was
everything he had just,

404
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,770
and so she goes,

405
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,280
I like trucks.

406
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,181
You know,

407
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,590
my ex boyfriend had a truck,

408
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,810
my boyfriend's back home had trucks.

409
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,190
And so what is he thinking when he,

410
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,861
what do I hear?

411
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:07,861
What I hear is she's talking about
these dudes who were probably truck I

412
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,951
pictured truck.

413
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:10,360
I've picture brutish men,

414
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:10,840
right?

415
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,880
Gorilla fucking her in
the back of this truck.

416
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,500
Just throwing some hay down,

417
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,840
ripping her pants off and
just fucking send it in.

418
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:17,674
It's not alone.

419
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,441
Of course,

420
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:19,000
this isn't fucking,

421
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,590
there's a line of dude's ropes,

422
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,330
fucking stirrups on shit.

423
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,520
But she would say that kind of shit.

424
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,150
You know,

425
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,900
she would always make jokes about him
being old or make various jokes about

426
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,740
whatever.

427
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,250
You know,

428
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,870
she was trying to chip them down about,

429
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,130
but I'll never forget that.

430
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,720
You know,

431
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,553
I like trucks.

432
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,810
All my ex boyfriend's
back home had trucks.

433
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,501
He's like,

434
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,130
yeah,

435
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,900
that's just a gross thing to say.

436
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,201
Yeah.

437
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:42,640
And you get that from your parents.

438
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:42,911
I mean,

439
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:43,900
they model it for you.

440
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:45,790
How you're going to treat
your spouse is like,

441
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,590
I see it every fucking time.

442
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,950
I was hanging out with a friend a couple
of nights ago and the parents were

443
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:51,790
around the,

444
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,241
his,

445
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:52,720
uh,

446
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,800
his inlaws were around and I could
see the way they treat each other.

447
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:57,040
I was like,

448
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,400
Oh yeah,

449
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,233
that's your marriage.

450
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,133
That's how your wife,

451
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,950
Oh,

452
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,783
it's so true.

453
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,591
So my parents,

454
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,190
like,

455
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,660
they really respected each other.

456
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:05,860
Like they never,

457
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,761
they never did that.

458
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:08,170
They kicked it around a lot,

459
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:11,080
but it was so obviously
fun what they were doing.

460
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,330
And they really respected each other.

461
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:14,710
They never took shots in public.

462
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,460
And when they had to,

463
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,150
if they had to have a serious
discussion and it wasn't yelling,

464
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,100
they would wait till we went to bed.

465
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,210
They go on the other side of the house,

466
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:23,080
closed the door,

467
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,340
and we heard muffled,

468
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,443
you know?

469
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,360
Whereas like some people just Sir
fucking argument in front of their kids,

470
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:28,601
it's like,

471
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:28,691
well,

472
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:30,610
that's what your kids are
going to do when they grow up.

473
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,150
Yeah.

474
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,710
Yeah.

475
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,080
That's,

476
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,040
that's super important,

477
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:33,810
man.

478
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,810
It's super important to show them the
model of what's possible and if you're in

479
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:40,030
a bad relationship,

480
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:41,800
it's just as equally important to get out.

481
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,310
Right.

482
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,860
One of the really important things my
mother taught me when I was a little kid

483
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:46,810
is getting out of a relationship.

484
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,280
When we were five,

485
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,140
she moved to Sim with my grandmother,

486
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,400
and then we got an apartment.

487
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:54,940
We moved out of my dad's place because
her and my dad were involved in this,

488
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,350
a abusive relationship.

489
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,210
So I remember thinking that like,

490
00:13:58,211 --> 00:13:58,900
wow,

491
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,130
like my mom was smart.

492
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,300
She does the right thing.

493
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:02,111
When Shit goes wrong,

494
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,040
she doesn't just take it.

495
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,110
She has options out.

496
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,770
She figures a way out of it,

497
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:06,670
even with two kids,

498
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,510
you know?

499
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,730
So it took a lot of courage to do,

500
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:10,541
