1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,720
Here we go,
folks,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,400
I know we had some issues.
I know in the past it hasn't always gone

3
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:14,401
perfectly,
but today we're going to try your 

4
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:15,730
hardest gonna.
Try her hardest to get shit together.

5
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:19,360
Folks put it together.
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience

6
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:22,330
podcast is brought to you by 
audible.com.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,110

if you have never used audible.com
or heard of them.

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,650
It's an excellent resource for audio 
books,

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,030
perhaps the best on the net and that's a
strong statement,

12
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:46,900
but I stand by it more than 100,000
different titles.

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,080
I'm a great books like our friend Chris 
Ryan sex at dawn that's on,

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,750
that's available on audible.

15

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,020
Uh,
if you don't use audio books,

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,820
you're a silly bitch because they're 
awesome.

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,270
It's great if you have to travel.
If you get stuck in traffic,

19
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:05,620
if you're sitting on a bus,
it's.

20
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:10,621
It's an an amazing thing that can take 
an otherwise wasted moment in time and 

21
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:14,470
actually make it enjoyable and make,
make it educational.

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,780
Only enrich yourself while you're on the
bus.

23
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:21,781
Bitch.
Get it together and if you go to 

24
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:21,781

forward slash Joe,

25
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,520

bucks or for 30 days rather than 30 days

26
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:27,100
for free audio service and one free 
audio book.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,500
Go try it,
check it out.

28
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,930
We are also brought to you by hover.
Hover is a domain name company that's 

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,331
owned by the same people that own Tang 
and if you know how how gushy Lovey we 

30
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:45,121
are at a 10,
you know that we feel the same way 

31
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:45,121
about.
Hover the idea behind ting.

32
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:49,580
What I love about it is that they're 
trying to give you a great deal on 

33
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:54,901
excellent service and they're trying to 
make things as sort of as easy and 

34
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:58,770
ethical is as simple and fair as 
possible and that same sort of attitude 

35
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,710
is taken up by hover.

36
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,380
They try to provide you with things for 
free,

37
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:04,840
that other domain name companies will 
make you charge for it.

38
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:07,430
Like who is domain name privacy?
Um,

39
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,480
if you go to hover.com
forward slash rogen,

40
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,320
you will get 10 percent off your domain 
name registrations.

41
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,560
I actually have domains registered 
through hover.

42
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:18,880
Um,
uh,

43
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,620
I got a bunch of them that I'll probably
never use,

44
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,080
but I had an idea.
I can't tell you right now,

45
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:28,081
man,
I can't tell you I had a project in 

46
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:28,081
mind.
Um,

47
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:28,081
but,
uh,

48
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,340
but you know what,
I don't have kids and projects.

49
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,080
I started them up and then I go,
shit,

50
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,620
what the fuck am I doing with this?
The weed silly website idea.

51
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,610
But if you wanted to register a website,
I mean I obviously run actual.

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,460
I mean I have Joe Rogan.net
and there's other websites,

53
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,630
but if you want to start your own 
hovers,

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,060
where'd it go?

55
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,590
Go check it out.
And uh,

56
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,610
I believe you get a free domain name 
registration if you sign up for more 

57
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:53,610
than a year,
right?

58
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,160
Isn't it?
Something like that.

59
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

60
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,490

it's an awesome company.

61
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,060
So go check it out.
Hover dot forward slash rogen.

62
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,440

63
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,990
Uh,

64
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,800
No,

65
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,700
right?
Oh,

66
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:08,470
stamps.com
stamps.com.

67
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:08,850
Which,
uh,

68
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,670
if you,
uh,

69
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,330
if you've ever seen those silly desk 
squad kittycat tee shirts that brian red

70
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:19,331
band creates,
and if you haven't seen them go to 

71
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:19,331
[inaudible] dot TV there,
they're pretty bad ass.

72
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:23,610
And uh,
especially the hypnotic looking one 

73
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:23,680
psycho psychedelic cat.
I love that little fucker.

74
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,040
But uh,
Brian sends all that stuff through 

75
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,040
stamps.com.
If you are a,

76
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,480
someone who runs her own business,
go into the post office can be a real 

77
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,871
pain in the ass.
It's a long wait in line to deal with 

78
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:40,261
some unenthusiastic person that doesn't 
really want to weigh your shit and tell 

79
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:40,261
you how much it costs.

80
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,540
A huge trend.
There's like there's people waiting 

81
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:45,540
behind.
You were like,

82
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:45,540
really?
You're,

83
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,621
you're bringing boxes of shit in here.
You can actually do all this stuff right

84
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:52,750
from your desk.
You have to do is go to stamps.com

85
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,350
and check out how it works.
You buy.

86
00:03:55,351 --> 00:04:00,351
And print an actual official us postage 
for any letter or package using your own

87
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,090
computer and printer.
I mean it's an amazing thing.

88
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,900
They send you a digital scale and 
calculates exact postage.

89
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,620
There's a little microphone.
If you go to stamps.com,

90
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:12,880
there's a little microphone in the upper
corner.

91
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:16,150
If you click on it and enter the Promo 
Code J R,

92
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:21,210
e Dot,
you will get a $110 bonus offer which 

93
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,400
includes a digital scale and up to $55 
of free postage.

94
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,860
It's an excellent service folks.
And again,

95
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,830
if you run a business and you don't use 
stamps.com,

96
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,480
you're really being silly because it's.

97
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,400
It will make your life so much more 
simple.

98
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,940
If you have to dread those treks to the 
post office.

99
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,050
I'm sure.
I'm sure that scale will be good for 

100
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,280
weighing out tobacco to how dare you.
How dare you in the middle of the 

101
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,661
stamps.com.
And if you don't think you're really 

102
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:48,661
talking about tobacco,
I do not believe you.

103
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,180
Listen,
we ain't no way endorse selling illegal 

104
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,150
tobacco and then shipping it using 
stamps.com.

105
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,830
That is not what stamps.com
was for.

106
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,350
Okay.
Stamped out skits for flags.

107
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,380
If you're selling American flags,
if you've got maybe ammo that needs to 

108
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,030
be shipped legally.
State to state.

109
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,280
Yes.
Go to stamps.com,

110
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:12,530
but please no illegal tobacco in the 
Canadian.

111
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,430
Pretty bad at scale right there.
That was all right.

112
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:18,040
It was.
All right.

113
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,110
Ladies and gentlemen,
just go there.

114
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,910
The code has jre.

Relax,

120
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,820
Rinse.
Douglas.

121
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,430
Rushkoff is here.
Ladies and gentlemen.

122
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,320
Cue The music.
Okay.

123
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,630
Do you know how to do it?
It's kind of got too much tobacco in it.

124
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,360
Experience

125
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,130
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

126
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,370
Too Loud,
right?

127
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,170
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

128
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,890
The.
We have an adjustment thing here.

129
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,870
It's too loud.
We can actually lower your volume.

130
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,670
Where you at?
Are you this one right here?

131
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,670
Is that better?
Is that better for you?

132
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,600
Yeah.
Okay,

133
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,890
cool.
Sorry about that.

134
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,550
Didn't mean to blow your ears off.
Thanks for joining us.

135
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,060
Thanks for Douglas Rushkoff.
If you do not know of him,

136
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:15,590
hat is a,
what'd you call yourself?

137
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,830
A media analyst.
Which a theorist immediate Arthur.

138
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:20,450
Mainly author mainly.
Yeah.

139
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:25,451
And your new book is called present 
shock when everything happens all at 

140
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,840
once,
is that everything happens now.

141
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,860
And then when everything happens now I 
saw quite a few of your videos online.

142
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,500
It really,
really,

143
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:38,390
really interesting conversations and one
of them that really struck me was,

144
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:40,020
um,
you know,

145
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,240
several of them that struck me,
but one of them was your story of being 

146
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,540
mugged and you,
you told people on an online room like 

147
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,630
where you got mugged and people were 
upset that you in telling them that you 

148
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:00,191
got,
didn't telling the world that you got 

149
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:00,191
mugged there.

150
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:00,191
It was lowering their property values.
Yeah.

151
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:04,370
That was a bad one.
That's so crazy.

152
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:06,510
Yeah.
I mean it was one thing to get mugged.

153
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:09,070
It was just kind of freaky in itself,
you know,

154
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,600
and whatever shaman weirdness goes with 
that.

155
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,190
But,
um,

156
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,780
I guess what I was trying to do,
I mean deep down was probably elicit,

157
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,870
you know,
love and affection from people on my 

158
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,870
list.
You know,

159
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,690
so I put up,
oh you know,

160
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:26,860
and there was a social,
something social responsibility to it.

161
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:31,861
So I put up where I got mugged because 
everyone should know this is maybe a 

162
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:32,540
dangerous stretch here.
We got to maybe get a light.

163
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,190
But um,
yeah,

164
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,130
so I sent,
I sent it out and then um,

165
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,380
the first two emails I got back from 
this loving list of parents was how dare

166
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:44,360
you see exactly where it happened.
You know,

167
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:46,240
we live right across the street,
you know,

168
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,870
what you're going to lower our property 
values.

169
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,970
Are you selling now?
Is that,

170
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,650
is that.
No,

171
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:55,651
we're not selling.
But it was a really weird time when 

172
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:58,271
people needed their property values to 
go up because they were trying to get 

173
00:07:58,271 --> 00:07:58,520
bigger mortgages and pay down and do all
that.

174
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,420
And it was just like so panicky there 
about that,

175
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,710
that some,
you know,

176
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,770
someone was afraid of what if a 
newspaper covers it and it's bad and 

177
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,400
it's so weird when one's and zero's 
trump humanity,

178
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,920
you know?
And in that case,

179
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:18,530
that's exactly what that is.
It's ones and Zeros,

180
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,760
trump,
humanity.

181
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,970
Well yeah,
in two kinds of ones and Zeros,

182
00:08:21,971 --> 00:08:23,380
you know,
the ones and zeroes,

183
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,500
that money now and the ones and the 
startup of digital technology,

184
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:32,501
which I think can create a kind of a 
distance that feeling the impact of 

185
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:37,220
saying that to someone's face here.
Yeah.

186
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:40,040
There's a weird communication that takes
place online.

187
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,400
That's you.
It doesn't have any consequence,

188
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,150
you know,
you can,

189
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:49,151
you can do it anonymously and there's 
just like these barbs that you can just 

190
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,910
send out and illogically like in,
in,

191
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:55,911
in ways that you would never.
If you had to deal with someone one on 

192
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:55,911
one because you would feel it,
you would look at that.

193
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,390
You would feel the response,
you would be like,

194
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,470
why are you saying this?
Like,

195
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,330
like why?
Why are you being such an asshole?

196
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:05,331
But because you are anonymous,
so people are just like in this 

197
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:06,560
unnatural communication thing.
Right?

198
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,100
But then the part that worries me after 
that is if you get used to doing it like

199
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:16,101
that in an anonymous way online,
just to start to make the behavior a bit

200
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:19,680
more normative when you're even with 
your identity.

201
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,430
Oh,
I guarantee it has to.

202
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,800
It has to.
There's,

203
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,910
there's no free rides when it comes to 
that.

204
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,830
I,
I really feel like your thoughts,

205
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,870
you're kind like,
there was always a thing.

206
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,250
I remember when I was in high school,
this was someone in my school newspaper 

207
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,210
wrote like a funny critique about the 
boy scouts and one of the things that he

208
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:44,211
didn't like about the boy scouts was 
that they wanted you to keep your 

209
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:44,211
thoughts pure.
I,

210
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:44,400
he was like,
you know,

211
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:46,440
well my thoughts are my own thoughts,
you know,

212
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,100
as long as I don't do anything,
I don't think there's anything wrong 

213
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,100
with my thoughts.
Right.

214
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,080
And that was really smartly argued.
I remember reading that going,

215
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:56,310
wow,
this kid's pretty clever.

216
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,560
But then I thought about,
I'm like,

217
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,820
but you,
if you're thinking about creepy shit,

218
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,430
you probably are kind of creepy,
you know,

219
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:04,370
and it's not going to get any better.
Just,

220
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:09,450
you know,
you're just gonna eventually one day 

221
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:09,450
going to snap and then going to do 
something.

222
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:09,450
Maybe thing.
Yeah.

223
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,250
If you really are like the,
I don't know.

224
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:14,670
I mean everyone has their own definition
of thoughts being pure,

225
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,120
you know,
like a more lenient person might allow a

226
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:23,121
lot of healthy sexual things and the 
idea of thoughts being pure as long as 

227
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:24,690
it's not creeping.
But there's other people that would just

228
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,650
sit around and say,
well,

229
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:28,710
let me just think about creepy shit all 
day and not do it and I'm fine,

230
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,810
but there's no free ride.
There may be though you think.

231
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,370
Well,
I mean what you're describing like 

232
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:38,940
you're describing is you know,
the benefits of an absolute police state

233
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:41,340
as long as it was always right.
No,

234
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,600
that's no problem.
You know,

235
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,920
that's the problem.
I mean,

236
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,350
you can always get your,
my narrative report,

237
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,410
you know,
just maybe they're running really 

238
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:51,410
subscribing that.
I'm just saying that you've been,

239
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,130
you can't have really shitty thoughts 
and get through.

240
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,080
And I think that if you're really shitty
online,

241
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:57,240
if you have those thoughts,
even if it's only online,

242
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,750
I really believe that negative energy 
genuinely shitty.

243
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:02,150
I mean it's just how do you decide 
what's,

244
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,080
what's shitty and whatnot.
But yeah,

245
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,870
now it's people when their demeanor you 
are online without your face,

246
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:14,871
the meaning you can be online with your 
face on the meaning you can get in real 

247
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:18,040
life until you just got mean people.
Do you investigate pupils to it?

248
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,070
Like if someone sends you something 
weird on twitter,

249
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:25,071
do you go to their twitter page and see 
just all their country shit that they 

250
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:25,071
write to everybody and go,
oh,

251
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:29,500
they're just crazy guy.
I will admit I focus way more on the 

252
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,191
content tweets and emails and things and
on the ones that are 10 emails.

253
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:37,260
Oh,
your book was great.

254
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:37,850
Oh,
I love it.

255
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,040
You've changed my life.
My children worship at your altar.

256
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,820
He was like,
delete,

257
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:42,300
delete,
delete,

258
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,230
delete.
With this guy.

259
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:53,050
Yes,
this is the biggest piece of Shit I've 

260
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,050
ever read,
but I need 10,000

261
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,970
people.
Loved it more than life itself,

262
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,000
but I'll spend the rest of my week 
trying to convince this one guy.

263
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,730
Oh No,
you don't.

264
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,040
I am not a bad guy.
Why?

265
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,480
The book is actually okay.
You gotta learn the Internet well now.

266
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,930
Well,
it's inevitable.

267
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,970
It's hard.
It's hard not to engage people because 

268
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,530
they're like a person saying it to you.
It's very similar and to have someone 

269
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,970
who's public,
you know you're out there,

270
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:17,740
you have your,
your name is out there in the videos are

271
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:22,741
out there.
Anyone can find out about you and see 

272
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,231
you.
They can reach you to and reaching you 

273
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:25,231
on twitter.
You know,

274
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:28,720
they can send you some shitty thing just
to get a arise from you and then they're

275
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:33,070
just making you dance and you're dancing
dancing's to someone else's spell.

276
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,910
So you've got to learn how to just look 
at yourself and go,

277
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:37,630
does this make sense?

278
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:45,090
And be able to leave it,
but you've got to be able to do that to 

279
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,450
the point where where it's healthy and 
not beyond.

280
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,560
Yes.
At some point,

281
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:52,200
if everybody's going to wake up,
your bug needs to be this.

282
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:52,880
When it's,
you know,

283
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,520
you've got,
you can do this,

284
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,190
but you can't do that.
I,

285
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,170
well,
in the end of the sale,

286
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,300
the market would tell me.
I guess the market will tell you,

287
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,670
but you're not a dumb guy.
You'd never do that.

288
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,300
Never make a book like that.
That was so often out of line.

289
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:09,230
You would look at yourself along the way
down.

290
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,990
I can tell him talking to you for 10 
minutes.

291
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,600
You're not that Kinda guy,
but the kind of guy that would do that,

292
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:16,480
it's like there's certain people that 
are functional,

293
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:21,481
crazy and they can like figure some 
things out and chase some things down 

294
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,490
and then they'll get stuck in some sort 
of a weird Rut and you can't talk them 

295
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:26,490
out of it and you know,
you realize,

296
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,700
oh,
he was crazy all the time.

297
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,710
He just figured out how to get through 
life.

298
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,160
You know?
Those are the ones that will go off on 

299
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,160
crazy tangents and people go,
what are you doing?

300
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,580
Because the guy wasn't really nuts in 
the first place.

301
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,180
You're not nuts,
man.

302
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,530
You don't have to worry about that.
Just need to keep people around you to 

303
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,900
keep telling you you're not insane.
I can.

304
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,500
I think there's a good thing that comes 
from criticism though,

305
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,740
because it's even really harsh criticism
is because if they're ridiculous and if 

306
00:13:55,961 --> 00:14:00,961
you look at what they're saying,
if it's ridiculous and mean and it 

307
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:02,260
really reveals far more about them than 
it really does about you,

308
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,890
but look at what they're saying and is 
there any merit to it at all?

309
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:08,170
Does it make any sense or is it just 
nonsense?

310
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:10,900
It's just a guy being an asshole or if 
you weren't,

311
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:12,670
you could you find merit in it?

312
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,340
Like I've found criticism from the 
biggest assholes,

313
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:18,790
but it was like there was like a hair of
accuracy into it.

314
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,930
It made me reconsider certain things.
I mean,

315
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,590
in the most valuable thing about it.
For me,

316
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:26,830
it's entertaining.
It to some extent is just.

317
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,650
It makes me,
it makes me more flexible.

318
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,350
You know,
as a,

319
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,910
as a thinker,
you know,

320
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,790
if you can wrap your head around,
you know,

321
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,810
Oh,
where am I wrong?

322
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,090
It can make you a little indecisive 
because it's like,

323
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,590
well,
he's right and he's also write this,

324
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,400
but sometimes things are complicated.
I know,

325
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:43,420
but that's the whole.
That's,

326
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,110
you know,
for me,

327
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:46,000
the object of the game,
that's why I keep writing.

328
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:47,980
I'm writing about that now,
present,

329
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,560
being present.
If you're actually present,

330
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,930
you have to be present with yourself and
be president who you're with and that's 

331
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:58,940
the thing that everybody looks to be 
avoiding one way or another,

332
00:14:59,330 --> 00:14:59,960
you know,
whether,

333
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:04,961
whether they're doing it cold because I 
got to earn money or they're doing it 

334
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:04,961
because they got to check a device.

335
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:06,590
I mean there's the constant assessing 
and it's just.

336
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,740
I see so few people.
I walk into rooms now and I feel like I 

337
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:14,510
don't feel like I'm in a room with these
people.

338
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:17,930
There's no sort of social cohesion in.
They're not really present.

339
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:20,840
They're each in their own little 
segment,

340
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,580
you know,
connected with the internet or friends.

341
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,250
Yeah.
And then not connected with,

342
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,180
with each other.
You know,

343
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:26,990
I,
I am,

344
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,660
you know,
I'm a net fan.

345
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:31,730
I've been since the late eighties.
I've been,

346
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:36,731
you know,
pro bling bling or cyberpunk type 

347
00:15:36,731 --> 00:15:36,731
person.
But,

348
00:15:36,731 --> 00:15:40,970
you know,
I keep feeling like rather than using 

349
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,851
these things to,
to reach out to other people and 

350
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:42,851
connect,
you know,

351
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:45,440
we're using these things for business.
They've gotten super aggressive,

352
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:49,760
behavior's gotten way worse.
And I don't even think it's our fault.

353
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,820
I honestly think it's in these cases,
it's because we're living on this,

354
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:56,220
this,
uh,

355
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,890
uh,
an operating system,

356
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:02,891
but an economic operating system that 
just needs to feed off the net when 

357
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:04,190
it's,
should be our space,

358
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:05,600
not the economy space.

359
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,910
Yeah.
It's,

360
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,960
I,
I feel like we're in a stage of 

361
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,400
progression for this interconnectivity 
progression where we're starting off 

362
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:15,910
with,
you know,

363
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,220
we were starting off with just regular 
telephones and that is moved to cellular

364
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:20,570
phones,
which everybody carries,

365
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,600
which is going to move into some google 
glasses type thing which is going to 

366
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:25,600
eventually,
I mean,

367
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,000
down the line,
if you extrapolate 100 years or whatever

368
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:34,001
it's going to take.
There's gonna be some really crazy 

369
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:36,941
interconnectivity that people share.
And I think this stage that we're going 

370
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:40,961
through right now,
the anonymous stage of being able to 

371
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:43,991
like make a twitter account or some fake
name and just start saying mean things 

372
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:46,130
to random people like that ability is 
going to go away.

373
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,650
You're not going to have this anonymous 
portal like I,

374
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:52,040
I just think if you look at the way 
things,

375
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,670
I feel like the way I look at the 
future,

376
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,700
it's like the thing that's going to be 
really scarce is secrets.

377
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,400
I think we're going to be able to 
connect with each other in some way that

378
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,290
we probably can't even imagine right 
now.

379
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,430
Whether it's some neuro chip or 
something that you embed in your body,

380
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:12,290
whether it's nanotechnology,
whatever it is.

381
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,860
There's gonna come a day where we're 
like completely

382
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,480
each other.
But the beauty of that though is if it 

383
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,651
really worked,
it would bring us back to the now that 

384
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:28,441
we've been avoiding all this time with a
face to face live interaction where you 

385
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:30,010
can't fuck with each other because 
you're here.

386
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,930
You know there's this guy,
strange way to look at it.

387
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:34,180
Yeah,
I met this guy,

388
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:39,181
this show guy,
I'm a stage magician guy who could tell 

389
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:42,841
when people are lying.
I don't know if you've ever seen this 

390
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:44,701
guy.
He's like worked for the FBI and stuff 

391
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:44,701
and he can like,
he does all these tricks.

392
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:45,190
He lines up 10 people and he says,
okay,

393
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:48,550
one of you think and he,
he can really tell period when people go

394
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,580
online and I was thinking if he can tell
that people are lying because he's got 

395
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,681
this talent,
it means that on some level we all know 

396
00:17:57,681 --> 00:17:57,681
we all have that ability,
right?

397
00:17:57,681 --> 00:18:00,510
So we all on some level know when the 
other one's lying to us.

398
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,450
So it's kind of been,
if you're actually in the moment,

399
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,300
it's all exposed anyway.
Yeah,

400
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:09,720
I think there's a weird feeling that you
get when someone's being deceptive.

401
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,670
There's a weird feeling you get where 
you're like,

402
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,640
there's a sense of disturbance when 
you're communicating with them,

403
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:17,430
you this,
but you can't put it into tangible.

404
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,060
There's nothing you could say,
oh,

405
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,350
it was x amount of weight.
So here I know this is a real thing.

406
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,860
You know,
here,

407
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:23,790
I'll put it on a scale,
it's,

408
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,390
but there's some weird thing that 
happens when you,

409
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:32,391
when you're with someone,
like you can tell if someone's upset at 

410
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:33,030
you and not saying it.
They can be saying all the right words,

411
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:34,440
but you're like,
there's a certain,

412
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,710
there's a coldness or a lack of warmth 
or there's a little something I wrote 

413
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:42,720
about the women in a.

414
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,510
what's it called?
The housewives of Orange County.

415
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,740
I got obsessed with them because they 
were just having all of these awful 

416
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:51,740
disagreements all the time.
They,

417
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,090
the communications guy.
I'm trying to figure out what,

418
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:58,190
why is there communication breaking down
and so this is what I do.

419
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,680
So I know.
So I concluded in the end that is 

420
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,091
because they've put so much botox in 
their faces that they can't actually 

421
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:12,530
execute facial expressions in an honest 
way anymore in a way that the other 

422
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,560
person organically can react to.
My God.

423
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:18,561
These women in trying to kind of freeze 
time at age 29 ended up making 

424
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:21,810
themselves inaccessible to the now that 
they're in,

425
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,140
because you know,
you see one,

426
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,690
they'll say,
oh,

427
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:25,200
you know,
my,

428
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,310
you know,
my daughter,

429
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,170
I think she might have cancer,
and the other one like,

430
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,860
oh,
I haven't been in a smile.

431
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:32,040
Right?

432
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,400
So then we go to the first.
She said,

433
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,940
I can't believe I told her my daughter 
has cancer.

434
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:39,360
And the other one she says she's sorry,
but I can tell she's not of.

435
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,660
I mean that's just a metaphor,
but that's true.

436
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,600
They're like stuffing cotton in their 
mouth and they can't.

437
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,190
You can't understand what they're saying
right there.

438
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:52,310
They're ruining the facial communication
expressions of facial communication is 

439
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,000
we live in the woods shooting poison in 
their face to freeze it,

440
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,060
but they're to freeze it in time is that
they're trying to stop time and that's 

441
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,260
like A.
I understand the urge to stop time,

442
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:06,330
but when you stop time,
you lose the moment.

443
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,540
That's kind of the whole point.
I'm making second the net.

444
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,780
It can stop time in a certain way,
but you're going to lose certain moments

445
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:20,241
that you know,
so I'm all for being on the net and 

446
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:21,030
having a net moment,
but you know,

447
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:21,780
even here,
you know,

448
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:26,781
I've heard you do those ads before for 
those sponsors and you could just cut 

449
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,770
and paste,
you know,

450
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,710
you could cycle seven of them and maybe 
people wouldn't even know.

451
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:32,730
It's the same ones.
You know,

452
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,130
you could cut and paste from another 
show and throw it in.

453
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:35,970
But you decide,
no,

454
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:39,120
I'm actually going to sit here and read 
these three ads with my friends.

455
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,050
Well,
if I didn't do that,

456
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,140
I'd be really bored.
I never want to just read an ad.

457
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,130
So we always do it that

458
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,590
way.
We've always money you make.

459
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,100
And the model of the industrial age of 
course is to make print out more.

460
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,050
Yeah.
And the only way we would,

461
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,600
the only way we could even do any of 
this stuff,

462
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:03,630
the way we're doing this because we 
don't have anybody that we have to 

463
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:03,630
approve it with.
You know,

464
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,140
knowing that I don't have to go to NBC 
and say,

465
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:07,150
Hey,
this is what we're thinking of doing.

466
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:12,151
I know you have these commercials but 
we're just going to talk shit and 

467
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:12,151
occasionally we'll get to the point of 
the commercial,

468
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:16,681
but,
but ironically on the long run it ends 

469
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:19,981
up making more money,
certainly more money for the people who 

470
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:19,981
are actually doing it.
You know,

471
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:21,760
maybe by the other system you can make 
more total money,

472
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:23,410
but it's going to go to,
you know,

473
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,060
God knows what does that mean 
institution.

474
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,270
Anyway,
so,

475
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:31,490
so the fact that it is that it is live 
and it is a what an MP3.

476
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:35,470
Mainly it is mainly a podcast you think 
on the first hand,

477
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:39,460
because I'm looking to do make her kind 
of radio choice myself and it's like,

478
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,380
well I can do this for the man and make 
this amount of money kind of guaranteed,

479
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,650
but I'm going to have to stay between 
these site lines and I can go to this 

480
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,200
other road and actually do the thing I 
do.

481
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,080
You know,
there's not even a choice.

482
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,050
They're not in this day and age.
It's not necessarily,

483
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,630
it's they used to be a time where you 
would have to choose,

484
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,060
well,
this internet thing,

485
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:04,140
who knows if it's gonna work out,
but that's crazy like you,

486
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:09,141
you have an option to immediately jump 
in and get a gigantic group of people 

487
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:12,160
that are going to start retweaking and 
tweeting and listening to your stuff and

488
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:17,161
you'll,
you'll develop a giant following in no 

489
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:17,161
time.

490
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:20,190
And as that's happening,
all you're doing is you're selling ads 

491
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,320
for companies that you actually believe 
in.

492
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,400
You.
You could.

493
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,210
That's the only way you should do it.
Fuck working for some company that tells

494
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:29,200
you not to swear or not to do this or 
not to discuss that or you know,

495
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:32,440
that's not the stance we're taking on is
particularly complicated issue.

496
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,120
No,
fuck that.

497
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,890
That's the enemy of real thought.
The enemy of real thought,

498
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,510
his committee,
you know,

499
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:42,640
I don't know what you're really 
thinking.

500
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Everything you say has to go through a 
committee before it comes out of your 

501
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,001
mouth.
I want to know what the fuck you're 

502
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:51,001
thinking.
And,

503
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:51,580
and especially in,
in the sense of a radio show,

504
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,230
you know,
guy on the radio,

505
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:55,600
that's the whole thing.
It used to be like,

506
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:57,520
even Djs,
they used to be,

507
00:22:57,521 --> 00:23:02,521
this Dj likes this music,
so this sauce or broadcasting from the 

508
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:03,280
same city,
that urn,

509
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,940
that clear channel took over and it was 
like,

510
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,280
oh my gosh,
we're getting a recording that's done by

511
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:11,500
computer miles away.

512
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,210
This is my local rock and roll stations 
goes Jack Fms,

513
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:19,390
which is essentially like playing 
shuffle when you're on your ipad.

514
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:19,990
Just,
you know,

515
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:25,020
it could be anything of a number of 
things that they approve and they 

516
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,900
pretend we're wacky.
We just don't have any rules.

517
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:26,620
Like,
Oh,

518
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:30,070
we're Jack FM and that's like a standard
model.

519
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:35,071
There's like 100 Jack's across the 
country and probably even more than 

520
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:35,071
that.
It's weird.

521
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:37,300
I think radio's completely on its way 
out.

522
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:39,610
I think they're fucked.
I think that's like a,

523
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,870
it's a silly way to do it and no one's 
going to stick with it after a while.

524
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,530
Like why you're going to have Internet 
access in your car within no time.

525
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,790
That's a,
that's easy.

526
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:54,791
They could do that right now I already 
get that with podcasts on the iphone 

527
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,180
because I have my iphone bluetooth to my
car,

528
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,340
so I'll just immediately say,
oh,

529
00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:00,670
I'd like to listen to a Duncan trussell 
podcast and inner.

530
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,950
I've done it at a red light where it's 
so easy at a red light.

531
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:06,840
It's one to Dunkin donuts.
Boom.

532
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,700
There is the one aspect of radio that I 
feel like I would miss.

533
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,910
Is that local terrestrial,
the reality of it,

534
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,690
I guess.
I mean,

535
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:15,920
yeah,
we could still have,

536
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:16,630
I,
you know,

537
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,600
you can have an,
a la channel and I could have a,

538
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:25,601
you know,
this part in New York channel and you 

539
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:28,591
know,
we could do that technically with 

540
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:28,591
digital,
you know,

541
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:29,660
where you'd pick your,
your so called regional thing.

542
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:34,661
It'll be local stuff,
but the medium is not biased towards 

543
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:34,661
that.
The medium is,

544
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:35,870
it's all equivalent,
you know,

545
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:39,830
and I wonder would we drift further away
from,

546
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,860
from local and kind of the things that 
matter to us in the here and now or um,

547
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,160
you know,
will we choose that stuff?

548
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,470
I think,
you know,

549
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:56,471
instead of like a local radio station,
you're going to have a million people in

550
00:24:57,411 --> 00:25:00,770
la making their own music,
making their own,

551
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:03,080
putting their own shit out there that 
you can choose from,

552
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,360
you know,
whether it's a music list,

553
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:10,361
like a Pandora list or something like 
that someone puts together or whether 

554
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:10,520
it's podcasting.

555
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:15,580
I just think the idea of a local 
representative was always gross and it 

556
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:20,711
was always grows wolf man.
Jack was always gross because for every 

557
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:20,720
Wolf Man Jack,
there's a million other dudes.

558
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:24,200
It probably had interesting ideas as 
well and they had no outlet.

559
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,190
So you have one guy has this outlet from
this particular time.

560
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,480
That's crazy that that idea sucks.
The I,

561
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,980
the idea that we're dealing with now is 
way better.

562
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:37,760
It's like a billion outlet,
6 billion outlets and,

563
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:42,780
and there's no local anymore.
There's people that are in that town 

564
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,121
that'll tell you about things,
but everyone's more connected than ever 

565
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:47,240
before.
And because they are,

566
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,600
I mean the economy as we know,
it also has to go away to,

567
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,800
you know,
they're 26 billion people doing 

568
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:55,800
podcasts.
I mean,

569
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:55,810
you've got 2 billion left doing farming.
It's like,

570
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,120
did all the businesses go and you also 
lose those iconic figures like the wolf 

571
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,590
man Jack or like Howard stern or like 
the mate?

572
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,180
Well,
I mean,

573
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:10,181
I think you could still choose.
You would just have major every once in 

574
00:26:10,181 --> 00:26:11,340
a while something major would happen.
Right.

575
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,270
But it wasn't,
it wouldn't be,

576
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,990
wouldn't be that one guy who's your 
town's Guy.

577
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,850
You know,
when I grew up in Boston,

578
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,340
it was Charles Laquidara,
Charles Laquidara.

579
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:23,210
And the big mattress was like this.
He would call this morning show.

580
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:25,400
It's called the big mattress.
It was a great guy.

581
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,560
Lockwood era.
Really Nice Guy.

582
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,550
Met Him to eventually put he,
um,

583
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,670
he,
his,

584
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,140
he was like the number one radio DJ in 
Boston.

585
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:34,430
Everybody knew it.
You would go to,

586
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,710
when I was doing construction and go to 
job sites,

587
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:38,600
people would turn up or turn on the big 
mattress,

588
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:41,190
listen to Lockwood era.
And it was,

589
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,530
that was a show.
It was like that was shell.

590
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,070
And the only

591
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,660
way to get a show like that,
it's,

592
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,640
and not have a lot of options.
You know,

593
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,580
to have a show that everybody agrees 
we're all gonna listen to,

594
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,700
you know,
it's kind of the only like three 

595
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:55,700
options.
No disco,

596
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:55,720
no,
we're not listening to this go,

597
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,900
you know,
there wasn't like the Internet quality 

598
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:00,900
options that,
that,

599
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,780
that changes the whole game.
Like there's never going to be a CBS 

600
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,290
radio on the Internet and it does.
It will.

601
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,930
And it's going to replace everything 
terrestrial,

602
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,480
I mean on every sense.
So if you're saying,

603
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,280
we're saying everything's going to be 
replaced,

604
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,740
everything terrestrials going to be 
replaced first it's radio,

605
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:21,741
then it's other stuff.
All we have to make sure then is before 

606
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:26,781
we lose all those things,
which we're going to inevitably lose to 

607
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:26,781
say to ourselves,
what is,

608
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:31,560
what is it we value about those things 
that we want to bring into these digital

609
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:34,440
things before we're untethered in there.

610
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,750
You know,
before it's all the way.

611
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,860
Yeah.
Well we want our cake and we want to eat

612
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:42,861
it too.
We want the digital era and we still 

613
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,171
want mom and pop stores.
We're trying to like keep it all 

614
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:48,531
together.
And that's the question is can you get 

615
00:27:48,531 --> 00:27:48,531
both,
you know,

616
00:27:48,531 --> 00:27:48,531
so can you have this,
you know,

617
00:27:48,531 --> 00:27:52,730
very traditional narrative,
20th century industrial age culture live

618
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:54,960
right aside,
you know,

619
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:59,961
this sort of steady state economy and 
peer to peer currencies and local CSA as

620
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:06,170
you know,
can we have an iphone and organic chard 

621
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,510
and no slavery in Africa to get either.
Yeah.

622
00:28:09,511 --> 00:28:14,100
Is that possible open?
So we moved towards it or not,

623
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:19,130
you know,
it seems like that's what a great 

624
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:19,130
percentage of the world would like.
But it's,

625
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,580
we've made shackling little progress and
moving towards that potentially utopia.

626
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,540
Right.
But then,

627
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,870
but you know,
as long as we got a hope or try to 

628
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,450
envision that would say okay,
but,

629
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:36,590
but this shift that we're undergoing now
from an analog era to a digital one is a

630
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:43,221
bigger shift than just than just that 
there's a whole different digital media 

631
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,700
environment that we've gone into.

632
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:49,910
So we've gone into this from this.
This time is money expansionist economy 

633
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:55,850
live by the clock universe to one that's
potentially asynchronous.

634
00:28:56,521 --> 00:29:00,540
That's just off that off that day.
I remember when the net first came up,

635
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,660
it was like,
it was,

636
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:06,900
you know,
people in Austin and slackers and cyber 

637
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,861
punks.
The idea was that the net was going to 

638
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:09,861
give us more slack,
you know,

639
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:14,210
and it's ended up for most people kind 
of doing the opposite because they're 

640
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,420
always on and working and being 
monitored and all that and distracted.

641
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,250
But I mean,
I think if we,

642
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,900
if we,
uh,

643
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,250
take command of the way we're 
programming these things,

644
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,010
then we can use them to sort of,
to create,

645
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,050
you know,
the gorgeous culture,

646
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:29,840
slack to create,
you know,

647
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,120
what a few of us are,
are kind of discovering we can do like 

648
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,120
you're doing with this,
right?

649
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,690
You're just doing your thing.
Yeah.

650
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:41,810
I think we're trying to resist the 
inevitable and that inevitable is the 

651
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:46,761
symbiotic computer relationship.
There's going to be some sort of bio 

652
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:52,270
mechanical connections as when men 
talking to another man with that funds 

653
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:57,770
to a million people listening in their 
car or wherever the fuck they are 

654
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,580
asynchronous.
I really don't feel like we can stop 

655
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,191
that.
It seems like the things that we got so 

656
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:07,831
excited by as as these higher 
functioning primates are these new 

657
00:30:07,831 --> 00:30:12,301
things that we've created that input us 
or give us input in a way that our 

658
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:16,470
bodies completely not designed to to get
like through your ear phones,

659
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,560
like like listening to a podcast like 
the computer itself,

660
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,620
the ability to watch a video,
the ability to go to the movies.

661
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,260
It's all good.
This is the stimuli that's coming at us.

662
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:28,420
It's just we're not designed for it,
but it's.

663
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:33,430
But it's.
It's reconfiguring itself to be as 

664
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:33,430
seductive as possible.
Well,

665
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,330
because it's not what it's for,
right?

666
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,350
It's to seduce us into itself so that 
the companies behind it can make money 

667
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,340
and because we moved constantly in to in
a path of progression,

668
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,520
and if you look at the technology,
it's always going to move into a 

669
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,661
stronger grip.
We were never satisfied with any 

670
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:54,661
particular result at any particular 
time.

671
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:55,670
More choices.
Yeah.

672
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:58,540
We want more choices.
We want it to be powerful more fast.

673
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:00,400
We want,
we want better graphics,

674
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,620
we want bigger boobs.
That's not realistic enough.

675
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:04,190
Let's take it to the next level.
It's,

676
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,220
it's in this desire to get these 
experiences were pushing the technology.

677
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:14,221
Like ultimately that's what's getting.
What's interesting to me about that is 

678
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:18,060
while all that's pushing ahead,
what we get in a digital media 

679
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,661
environment is we ended up retrieving 
weird medieval values.

680
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:27,580
You know,
you get burning man and etsy and people 

681
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,720
doing peer to peer stuff,
trying to have their local currencies,

682
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,300
which they haven't had since medieval 
times.

683
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:36,301
You know,
you see the stuff that gets her 

684
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:36,301
treatment,
paganism,

685
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:37,020
men and uh,
you know,

686
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,140
mashing up a route to heal yourself of 
things,

687
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:45,180
maker culture.
All these things are what we've lost 

688
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,751
over the last thousand years.
That's what the renaissance and the 

689
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:48,751
industrial age was about.
You know,

690
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:50,110
stamping that out and putting everybody 
on the,

691
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:53,920
on the assembly line at Ford.
So it's fun that as we move forward,

692
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,790
we get these great old recurrences,
which to me is reassuring.

693
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,930
It means that we are bringing something 
with us into,

694
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:06,050
into this next place.
I think it's also that the current 

695
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,451
system is so flawed that people are 
willing to try anything and that they're

696
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:14,140
actually actively thinking about what 
can we do differently?

697
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,450
Can we make a local local currency?
Like you got to know him,

698
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,500
which is interesting because like the 
two places I've gotten emails from him 

699
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,160
the last many years of people doing 
social currency,

700
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,800
sorry,
either from a place like Ithaca,

701
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,970
New York where they're doing it because 
they're just,

702
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:33,130
you know,
strange and trying to try something 

703
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,921
weird and good.
Or like Lansing Michigan where there's 

704
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:38,131
no GM plant,
there's no bank that's going to give 

705
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:38,890
money to a factory to open up to hire 
people and they're desperate.

706
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,770
They're like,
well,

707
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,530
I've got skills.
I know how to fix a fridgerator and they

708
00:32:42,531 --> 00:32:47,531
have needs,
so can't we just make an economy that 

709
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:47,531
way?
You know,

710
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:48,850
those are the places where people are 
actually asking the,

711
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,290
the,
the where they're ready.

712
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,640
I just don't like that.
Readiness seems to involve being just so

713
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,700
I'm not just fed up but uncomfortable.
You know,

714
00:32:58,701 --> 00:32:59,900
that you've got to do something.

715
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,520
Yeah.
We're clearly going through change.

716
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:09,690
We're clearly going through a change as 
a culture that we weren't prepared for 

717
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:13,121
and we're sort of making our way as we 
go along and there's a lot of mistakes 

718
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:16,880
along the way and the evidence that 
points to it.

719
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:22,060
One of the best pieces as your story 
about people getting upset at you 

720
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,710
because you got mugged and called in the
story and said the location.

721
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,390
That's one of the best examples of 
people like losing the script like along

722
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:34,391
the way in this crazy thing that we're 
doing where we developed currency and 

723
00:33:34,391 --> 00:33:39,280
and then there's things called property 
values and those mortgages and equity 

724
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,970
and all this crazy shit along the way.
You know,

725
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:42,610
we're going to have to figure out how 
to,

726
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:46,190
how to stay human and when you see like 
instant failure,

727
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,240
like,
oh my God,

728
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:47,840
I got mugged.

729
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,950
You fucking asshole.
What are you?

730
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,140
Why'd you say the place?
It's interesting.

731
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:55,490
I made it in every single one of my 
books and I've written like 12 now.

732
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,440
You know,
they're,

733
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,500
they're all finally about how do we 
bring humanity into this thing that 

734
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,380
seems to have lost it.
So I did it for,

735
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:03,980
you know,
for,

736
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,050
for business,
I did it for,

737
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:11,051
for the economy with Life Inc is the 
book you're talking about did it for 

738
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:11,660
Judaism,
something called nothing sacred.

739
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:13,610
St Judaism should be this ongoing 
conversation.

740
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:14,990
Keep it alive,
keep it human,

741
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,810
don't let it lock down.
And now this one,

742
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:22,811
it's weird because it's like I'm kind of
admitting that it's what I guess I'm 

743
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:22,970
realized it myself,
but I'm kind of saying,

744
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:24,290
oh my gosh,
I'm a humanist.

745
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,520
No,
I'm a humanist and a technology 

746
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,771
enthusiast hadn't how do you be both 
because so many of the other folks who 

747
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,420
are sort of pro technology,
sort of my posse and they're all sort of

748
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:40,421
talking about not human beings being 
enabled by technology but technology 

749
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,030
surpassing us,
you know,

750
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:46,340
some singularity or you know,
some,

751
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:51,370
some moment in the future where 
computers get smarter than us and then 

752
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:51,890
we're not really needed anymore.

753
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,750
It might not be that simple.
I'm a,

754
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,520
I've been thinking about it a lot lately
and one of the things I think is why do 

755
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,851
we have this idea of competition and why
would the computer enjoy that idea with 

756
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:08,531
us?
Our idea is based entirely on our 

757
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:11,231
biological makeup,
our need to reproduce or need to prove 

758
00:35:11,231 --> 00:35:12,320
ourselves to our mate or need to protect
against strangers.

759
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,800
All these instincts that a computer's 
not going to have at home.

760
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:20,870
So the idea of competition with humans 
for resources or the even the idea that 

761
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,950
survival is imperative and that you 
know,

762
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:25,360
you,
you,

763
00:35:25,361 --> 00:35:28,070
you have an ego and you can't die,
they're not going to have any of that.

764
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,470
So why would they be in competition with
us?

765
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,910
Why wouldn't it just be like any new?
It wouldn't be because of them.

766
00:35:34,911 --> 00:35:37,290
It'd be because of the program.
The program

767
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,520
though that that's really wouldn't do 
the bad thing.

768
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,170
Okay.
So why not keep us around,

769
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,960
but it doesn't matter.
I don't even not.

770
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:50,030
It's not a matter of them being able to 
do that because I don't even think they 

771
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,190
will.
I don't think they can.

772
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,400
It's more a matter of people in the here
and now saying that human beings are 

773
00:35:56,131 --> 00:36:01,131
really only important insofar as we can 
be the shepherds and organizers of 

774
00:36:01,131 --> 00:36:03,780
information.
Information is the thing that's evolving

775
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:08,100
towards greater states of complexity and
once human beings are no longer the best

776
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,550
at making complex information,
but computers are the best at it,

777
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,880
then there's just no need for humans 
anymore with the computers kill us or 

778
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,421
not.
I don't know what they give us a good 

779
00:36:20,421 --> 00:36:20,421
time,
who knows?

780
00:36:20,421 --> 00:36:20,421
But,
but the,

781
00:36:20,421 --> 00:36:23,580
just the whole idea that we should be 
developing technology with this in mind.

782
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,990
Um,
I dunno it,

783
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:29,220
it negates what I think is an essential 
for us anyway,

784
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,280
centrality of humanity in the equation.
While I think people don't recognize how

785
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:41,211
much we need each other,
we don't recognize how important 

786
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:45,771
positive interaction is with other 
people to your health and the way you 

787
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:49,131
feel about life.
There's clearly a relationship that 

788
00:36:49,131 --> 00:36:53,991
people have to each other that were in 
denial about the lock ourselves up in 

789
00:36:53,991 --> 00:36:58,071
our apartments or our homes.
And we shut our car doors and we rolled 

790
00:36:58,071 --> 00:37:01,431
down the window and that's one of the 
reasons why people are willing to give 

791
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:01,431
people the finger when they're in the 
car.

792
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:05,241
He would never do that in real life.
You feel like you're in some sort of a 

793
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:05,440
contained world and even though you're 
not even anonymous,

794
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:06,840
who still like,
fuck you,

795
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,150
you know how many people do give the fan
in real life?

796
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:14,150
Like nobody.
But once a year I'll give somebody the 

797
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,941
finger.
Somebody does something crazy and they 

798
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:16,941
beep at me.
Fuck you.

799
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:16,980
Fuck you.
It's beautiful.

800
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:21,981
It's a beautiful thing to do.
But you know that eventually I think we 

801
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:28,551
have to accept the fact that we were 
only happy when the people around us are

802
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:34,341
happy,
when we're in harmony with the people 

803
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:34,560
around us were not happy.
When we're in conflict,

804
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:35,580
we're not happy.
When,

805
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,230
when we're not happy,
when we fuck people over.

806
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,260
Like I know people that have done bad 
things in business and bad things 

807
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,260
ethically and bad,
you know?

808
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,890
And they're not happy.
No.

809
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:48,330
But then in the current culture they can
compensate for that with medicine.

810
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,740
Say that type of presence that gets them
through the night,

811
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,810
like you have to hope.
I mean,

812
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:56,820
I always do,
which is to vain hope.

813
00:37:56,821 --> 00:38:00,300
I hope that the people who do bad stuff 
but then make up for it with drugs still

814
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:01,440
feel worse than I do.

815
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,660
Not taking those drugs and trying to do 
good stuff and you don't want to believe

816
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:06,960
that,
you know,

817
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:09,170
these kind of guys I used to see,
um,

818
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,230
I won't even say his name,
one of those millionaires down at Knicks

819
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,850
Games and I had always think,
I sure hope he's not happy.

820
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,450
That's fine,
isn't very fair.

821
00:38:18,451 --> 00:38:23,451
But a while hold he's doing is playing 
some really crazy game that was around 

822
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:27,261
before he was ever born.
He just got into it and got really good 

823
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:27,261
at it.
The game itself,

824
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:30,090
it's bananas,
just the stock market itself.

825
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:32,880
Just the idea that the wealth of,
of,

826
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,980
of a person can vary day by

827
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,920
day because of confidence,
you know,

828
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,580
confidence,
computer,

829
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,500
consumer confidence in a product can 
shift and change with recall.

830
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,730
And then watching these numbers go up 
and down like what the fuck are you even

831
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:51,220
talking about?
Most of the explanations you see,

832
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:56,221
you know,
I watched these business sites and the 

833
00:38:56,221 --> 00:38:56,221
market will go down and they say,
oh mark it down because of such and such

834
00:38:56,221 --> 00:38:57,070
in London.
And then it's like,

835
00:38:57,071 --> 00:39:02,071
by the time that piece comes out that 
markets actually back up and they're 

836
00:39:02,071 --> 00:39:02,071
already constructing their,
you know,

837
00:39:02,071 --> 00:39:04,330
let's tie market going back up to 
another random feature.

838
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:05,230
You know,
it's like the,

839
00:39:05,231 --> 00:39:10,231
the,
the explanations after the fact to have 

840
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:12,931
so little to do with whatever.
Some algorithm decided it was going to 

841
00:39:12,931 --> 00:39:15,580
suddenly ultra fast trade something and 
throw the stock up.

842
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,110
You know,
it's like at this point it's,

843
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:17,890
it truly is.

844
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:23,060
That's the best place to see humans 
combating machines on the market where 

845
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:27,061
it's like there's human traders 
competing with these programmed 

846
00:39:27,061 --> 00:39:28,270
algorithms and the algorithms are 
certainly winning the war.

847
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,520
And if you look at their screens while 
they're,

848
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,800
while they're doing it,
it is almost like code.

849
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,260
Like the average person who doesn't 
understand it,

850
00:39:35,261 --> 00:39:38,170
doesn't know what the fuck the stock 
market saying the symbols.

851
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:39,370
And the essay,
Oh,

852
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:41,230
and this and that and the ones and the 
Zeros.

853
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,270
You look at all that,
you have no idea what that is.

854
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:48,271
I mean,
how is that really different than a 

855
00:39:48,271 --> 00:39:48,271
computer code that you're reading me 
that's essentially like a,

856
00:39:48,271 --> 00:39:49,630
a way that people are,
are,

857
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:50,020
are,
are,

858
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:55,060
are tapping into this bizarre system.
I mean it was at one time the sort of 

859
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,030
the price of something had to do with 
some thing.

860
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,270
It's like there's a factory,
oh it's factory went slower today in the

861
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:01,630
rain.

862
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,150
The market will go down on that.
It was like real,

863
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:09,340
you know?
And I think it's gotten certainly 

864
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,730
further and further from whatever is 
going on in that company or their 

865
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,640
earnings are the things,
you know,

866
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:17,641
it's,
it's absolutely abstracted to the point 

867
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:17,641
now where people don't even invest in 
companies,

868
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:22,320
right?
You invest in something like when 

869
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,001
facebook went public,
people bought it at like nine in the 

870
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:24,001
morning at like nine,
10.

871
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:25,030
They're all pissed off that it hasn't 
gone up.

872
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,290
It's like,
wait a minute,

873
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,770
I was supposed to my well my wealth.
It's like,

874
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:30,190
no,
you don't.

875
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,520
You don't make money on the trade,
you're supposed to make money on when 

876
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:35,520
you've,
when you've done it,

877
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,580
but now we've got,
you know,

878
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:41,581
derivatives and derivatives of 
derivatives and derivatives of 

879
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:41,581
derivatives,
of derivatives on there,

880
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:43,660
which is just a way of kind of shrinking
the.

881
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,080
Explain that for people don't know what 
that means.

882
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:47,800
So if you buy a stock,
I mean,

883
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:52,801
you know,
you buy stock and hope it goes up and 

884
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:54,661
then you sell it in the future.
If you'd rather make up that time right 

885
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,380
now,
I can sell it in the future right now,

886
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:01,740
right?
I can basically sell that future sale 

887
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,080
because I think that sales is going to 
be a good one now.

888
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,820
Right?
I can say,

889
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:04,990
what if I did that trait?
I'm gonna,

890
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,460
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna have it now,

891
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,030
but

892
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,350
one of I trading,
then I'm trading.

893
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,380
I'm trading on,
on an abstraction from what something's 

894
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:18,380
going to be worse at some moment in the 
future.

895
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:23,630
So it's like I'm trading on the stock 
over time and then someone else will 

896
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:23,630
say,
well,

897
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:23,730
I'm going to trade on the abstraction of
that.

898
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:28,910
I'm going to trade on whether or not 
people think the stock in the future is 

899
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,700
going to be worth more next minute.
Then this minute it's like,

900
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,780
well,
what's that?

901
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,190
So basically what you're doing is you're
buying stock over time,

902
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,630
over time,
over time.

903
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:38,000
Over time,
you're creating these things,

904
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:41,510
these derivatives of whatever the 
original investment was,

905
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,120
which is kind of just a derivative of 
the thing,

906
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,380
right?
There's the pork belly,

907
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:46,940
this derivative,
the pork belly derivatives,

908
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:48,860
and the derivatives.
Derivatives of derivatives,

909
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:50,210
of the derivatives,
of the derivatives,

910
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:55,450
all,
all ever tighter ways of saying what is 

911
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:55,450
pork belly going to be worth,
you know,

912
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,220
on February third,
why is that legal?

913
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,260
Well,
it's legal because what it.

914
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,540
Because the economy requires it,
right?

915
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,760
We have a kind of money,
right?

916
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:09,761
That has a clock in it.
It's lent into existence and has to be 

917
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:13,121
paid back more than got lent out.
So our economy needs to expand by hook 

918
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:18,641
or by Crook.
Somehow it has to grow in order for it 

919
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:21,521
to survive.
That's just the way central currency 

920
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:24,041
works.
They need to find more surface area for 

921
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,550
the money.
More ways for people to buy stuff.

922
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:28,610
So instead of just having,
there's not enough of a company to buy,

923
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:32,990
so now we can bet on how that company's 
going to do in some future date.

924
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:34,820
We can bid on that or we can bet on 
that.

925
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,010
Right.
But what we're really doing is trying to

926
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:42,011
kind of compress all of this time,
right onto like the head of a pin so we 

927
00:42:42,011 --> 00:42:42,290
can bet on that.

928
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,300
So I don't have to sit and wait,
you know,

929
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:49,301
3000 years for facebook to be worth 
something I can trade on his future 

930
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:52,010
worth now.
But the whole joke of that is people who

931
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:57,011
are trading that way,
there are these computers that are 

932
00:42:57,011 --> 00:42:57,011
trading faster than them.
So I put in one of my super fast,

933
00:42:57,011 --> 00:42:57,890
crazy,
you know,

934
00:42:57,891 --> 00:42:59,000
um,
derivative trade.

935
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,960
Goldman Sachs sees that order coming in 
on the computer.

936
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,600
They're so close to the exchange,
they can execute an order before my 

937
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,731
order even goes through based on having 
seen that I was going to do what I'm 

938
00:43:12,731 --> 00:43:16,331
going to do.
So they can literally trade in my 

939
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:16,331
future.
Right.

940
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:17,740
I am in their past though.
That's,

941
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,110
that's digital time shifts.
That sounds like it's cheating.

942
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,280
That's like someone running a quick 
server and they're local and then you 

943
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,890
have like 150 paying.
Exactly.

944
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:28,910
That's bullshit.

945
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,690
I think so.
It will be so bullshit.

946
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,890
The irony of it is it's gotten so big,
right?

947
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:36,170
Derivative trading is bigger than 
regular trading,

948
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,640
so the New York Stock Exchange actually 
just got bought.

949
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,450
The exchange itself got bought by its 
derivative exchange,

950
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,360
so it's almost just like the proof's in 
the pudding.

951
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:50,390
It's like the derivative owns the market
at this point,

952
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:56,080
but that's allowed that how.
How could the government even ever deny 

953
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,150
how incompetent they are when they 
allowed that,

954
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:04,410
like that alone to like someone should 
just have a broadcast on national 

955
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:09,911
television,
a one of those town hall sort of events 

956
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:11,990
where you sit down with the main people 
that run the country and go,

957
00:44:11,991 --> 00:44:13,880
how the fuck are you allowing this?
How?

958
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:14,900
How will you,
if not,

959
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:19,901
fix this.
Why would you ever try to do anything 

960
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:21,650
else before you fix this?
When they made the decision,

961
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:26,651
they genuinely thought it would be good 
for business in the short term.

962
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:30,920
I will never understand.
Big business people promise them,

963
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,490
figure it out before it got really bad.
Oh my God,

964
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,270
we'll figure it out before it got really
bad.

965
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:39,000
How much bigger is the derivative 
economy?

966
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,760
I don't know exactly.
I mean it seemed.

967
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,650
I was looking,
trying to find out what the,

968
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,690
what the sort of trading was.
It seemed,

969
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:51,020
from what I could tell,
like 94 percent of trades are now 

970
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,050
derivative because they're in because 
they're.

971
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:57,240
Because there's such a bigger volume,
so that's insane.

972
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:59,340
No one's gonna like,
you're not going to buy 10,000

973
00:44:59,341 --> 00:45:01,260
shares of Honeywell today because 
that's,

974
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,400
you know,
you know,

975
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:03,690
whatever.
$60,000

976
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:05,670
or something.
But you could buy like 10,000

977
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,460
futures on Honeywell because they're,
oh really?

978
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,340
Gee God,
that is so crazy.

979
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:17,770
Percent of the trades are.
And how many more?

980
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:19,950
It's,
I think it's ultra fast.

981
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:20,910
Two is a whole other.

982
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,570
There's sort of two different.
Two different realms.

983
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:25,590
But yeah,
to huge.

984
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:31,070
They must all be crazy.
Everyone involved in the must know that 

985
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,360
they're bringing on the matrix.
They must know that they're there.

986
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:35,280
They're the first steps before the 
digital machine takes over.

987
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:40,490
They must know.
They must know that there's no humanity 

988
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:40,490
in that stock market.
Shit.

989
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:42,300
That's chaos and,
and again,

990
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:44,910
I don't want digital technology to get 
blamed for this,

991
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:50,120
right?
Because the real operating system 

992
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:50,120
they're promoting is not the digital 
operating system.

993
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,200
It's the economic operating system 
underneath it.

994
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:55,470
It's this 13th century central currency 
interest bearing,

995
00:45:55,471 --> 00:46:00,471
debt based economy,
and none of the guys who I thought we'd 

996
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:01,320
get us out,
you know Evan Williams with twitter,

997
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,420
Mark Zuckerberg,
with facebook,

998
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,010
the kids from Google,
right?

999
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,710
They're getting the.
Each of them had a real shot.

1000
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:12,930
Even Bill Gates at breaking the central 
economy and and flipping things the 

1001
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:14,460
other way.

1002
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,650
Not going,
not going public,

1003
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,870
not be good,
not doing it with venture capital.

1004
00:46:18,871 --> 00:46:20,550
Saying if I can,
if,

1005
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:25,290
if Google can hack web search,
if facebook can hack social,

1006
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,800
if twitter can hack everybody,
why can't they?

1007
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:32,520
If they're so busy disintermediating all
these different things,

1008
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:36,690
why doesn't anyone of them yet want to 
disintermediate central banking and say,

1009
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:37,470
no,
Mr.

1010
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,030
Chase,
we don't actually need you.

1011
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:40,650
We're gonna do our whole thing through 
kickstarter.

1012
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:42,780
Say like one of your didn't want to hear
things.

1013
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:46,170
Yeah.
That's an interesting point of view.

1014
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:49,440
I think they probably would never want 
to take that stand because they would be

1015
00:46:49,441 --> 00:46:54,441
killed.
I would imagine there's a lot of money 

1016
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:54,550
in,
uh,

1017
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:59,710
in,
in them not being successful with that 

1018
00:46:59,710 --> 00:46:59,710
quest,
you know,

1019
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:02,490
to the point at which,
you know,

1020
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:03,680
you're doing paper,
okay,

1021
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,600
we're gonna let people do individual 
transactions.

1022
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:11,601
That was their original model and they 
were going to make money on the float 

1023
00:47:11,601 --> 00:47:12,330
and then the banks came to them and 
said,

1024
00:47:12,331 --> 00:47:13,560
ah,
you're not allowed to do that.

1025
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,020
You're not a bank paypal kids.
You've got to be,

1026
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:21,100
you know,
can I just start as a bank or you're 

1027
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:21,100
going to have to be connected to one of 
us and that's when,

1028
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:25,311
you know,
pay pal kind of becomes part of Ebay 

1029
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:25,311
rather than whatever these crazy guys 
might've done.

1030
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:28,480
And I suppose there's this point where,
you know,

1031
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,940
innocently these companies that get 
bigger and bigger and bigger,

1032
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:32,740
hoping to do the right things,
and then it's like,

1033
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:39,270
we're gonna,
we're not gonna let you do this if you 

1034
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:39,640
don't,
if you don't play by our rules.

1035
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:45,030
But uh,
I also feel like there's companies that 

1036
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:45,520
if you,
if you're willing to go smaller,

1037
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,160
if you're willing to let it grow a 
little bit slower,

1038
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,640
that you can scale up,
you can become a big ethical 

1039
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:53,920
corporation.
Yeah.

1040
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:59,490
Yeah.
I was always wondering why a big 

1041
00:47:59,490 --> 00:47:59,490
corporation couldn't be ethical.

1042
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:03,120
Why?
Why can't you have a big corporation 

1043
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,120
with a,
a good ideology behind it?

1044
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:08,580
But I think it's really because of 
shareholders and shareholders are 

1045
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,490
inpatient.
Shareholders are there.

1046
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,410
They're not really there,
right?

1047
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,240
They're distant.
They're shareholders are,

1048
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:17,050
are people who just want to see a number
go up by the next quarter.

1049
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:20,050
And if you have to make a number go up 
by the next quarter,

1050
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,290
then you're going to have to be thinking
about something other than doing good in

1051
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:28,291
the world.
You if it is ones and Zeros at all 

1052
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:30,130
costs,
if that's the game you're playing and if

1053
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,500
you've got shareholders,
then you're going to throw you in jail.

1054
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:37,501
If you don't do that,
I mean that's your fiduciary 

1055
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:39,541
responsibility and it's a fascinating 
thing that a corporation can do 

1056
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,200
something that an individual would be a 
total piece of shit to do.

1057
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,590
If it was one person that was involved 
in this one guy,

1058
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,630
what he did was he,
you know,

1059
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:49,450
he gave the loans to the Third World 
Company,

1060
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:51,190
the countries that they couldn't pay 
back.

1061
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:56,220
He went over there,
monopolize our natural resources 

1062
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:56,220
himself,
dug the oil,

1063
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,520
lie himself,
polluted the river himself,

1064
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,490
you know,
raped and killed the villagers himself.

1065
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:05,730
He'd be like,
Jesus Christ locked that fucking guy in 

1066
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:05,890
jail.
He's making people work for $5 a week.

1067
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:09,460
You know that guy.
There he is there he is holding down,

1068
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,680
you know,
but because it's a corporation,

1069
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:12,310
you're like,
well,

1070
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:13,900
they're making money for their.
Exactly.

1071
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:16,180
And how many people who on the one hand,
you know,

1072
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:19,710
we'll read a good magazine or something 
or listen to us and,

1073
00:49:19,711 --> 00:49:22,930
and NPR and,
and be all sad about that stuff.

1074
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:28,050
Still has a 401k plan with stocks in the
very companies that are doing those 

1075
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,770
things.
So they're the ones who actually own the

1076
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:34,771
company.
They're the shareholder who wants to 

1077
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:34,771
think to go up so they could send their 
kid to college.

1078
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:34,771
You know,
I mean it's,

1079
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,760
it's,
it's interesting how circular it gets.

1080
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,720
So I mean,
for,

1081
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,690
for how unvirtuous that circle is 
though,

1082
00:49:39,691 --> 00:49:43,150
I think unwinding it is just,
is just as easy.

1083
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:44,050
So it's like,
okay,

1084
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:46,000
instead of doing these sort of long 
distance,

1085
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:49,210
longterm disconnected investments in 
mining companies,

1086
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:54,280
I'm going to invest my money where I see
it and people actually know in the place

1087
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:56,290
where I am,
who are trying to do something,

1088
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,940
you know,
and bring it,

1089
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,020
bring it,
if not,

1090
00:49:59,021 --> 00:50:00,100
uh,
if not local,

1091
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:04,210
at least at least into your present,
at least into your,

1092
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,060
into your visible reality.
Yeah.

1093
00:50:07,061 --> 00:50:08,900
And it really is the,
the,

1094
00:50:08,901 --> 00:50:13,901
the pursuit of the end goal of simply 
only ones and zeros done through a 

1095
00:50:13,901 --> 00:50:17,420
corporate way is really anti human.
I mean that's the,

1096
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:22,500
that's the real anti human aspect of it 
is that it will engage human suffering 

1097
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,690
as long as it's willing to extract ones 
and zeroes from that elected calculates 

1098
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,440
how much human suffering are we willing 
to cause,

1099
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,890
how much devastation to the environment 
or are we willing to cross so much,

1100
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:34,610
you know,
which is why.

1101
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:38,050
Then the question becomes,
I mean in the nightmare scenario then is

1102
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,460
you invest that into technology so that 
your robots,

1103
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,650
no,
they're not in competition with us,

1104
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:47,510
but they are playing the corporate 
program.

1105
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:51,710
They have no desire other than to 
extract,

1106
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:56,990
extract value and meaning from it.
And those computers running algorithms 

1107
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,330
recognize trends in the marketplace 
before a human could ever see it coming.

1108
00:50:59,331 --> 00:51:01,550
And then round countered.
And meanwhile,

1109
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:06,610
as we're making ourselves dumber about 
technology or I'm wearing this code 

1110
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:06,610
academy tee shirt,
right?

1111
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,870
Want people to learn to code.
As we become more stupid about our 

1112
00:51:11,511 --> 00:51:16,511
computers,
our computers are getting smarter about 

1113
00:51:16,511 --> 00:51:17,300
us doing big data repositories of every.
Every keystroke,

1114
00:51:17,301 --> 00:51:18,980
right?
Every are there.

1115
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:20,860
They know,
they know stuff about,

1116
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:25,460
I think knew some teenage girl was 
pregnant before family did and you know,

1117
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:28,100
they know when kids are going to be gay 
before they know themselves,

1118
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:32,430
you know,
it's like things got really smart and I.

1119
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:37,330
You go to a google when you google 
something or look for things,

1120
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:42,200
certain things online and then say you 
go to youtube and there's ads for things

1121
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:45,980
that you've recently looked at is scary.
Tantalizing ads.

1122
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:51,010
Oh I see you're into jeeps.
Why we have a jeep for sale and it's a 

1123
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:56,411
new jeep and here's a video you can 
click on and their ab testing that you 

1124
00:51:56,411 --> 00:52:00,761
know,
understand which is which he reacted 

1125
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:00,761
last girl or not girl and cheap 
correlation.

1126
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:02,060
Okay.
Give him that next time.

1127
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,010
Tits,
tits.

1128
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:09,280
Like they'll show you everything that 
you're into and you like you son of a 

1129
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:09,280
bitch.
How do you know about all this?

1130
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:14,910
It's weird and it's just the beginning.
We're accepting it slowly accepting the 

1131
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:19,421
needle and to our vein pumps in nano 
cells that eventually replace human 

1132
00:52:19,421 --> 00:52:24,131
tissue.
If there's going to be a commercial is 

1133
00:52:24,131 --> 00:52:26,161
going to be an artificial guys is going 
to be saying why would you want to be 

1134
00:52:26,161 --> 00:52:26,161
natural?
You're going to rot.

1135
00:52:26,161 --> 00:52:29,260
It's not fun.
Life gets even better as you get a buyer

1136
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,380
buyer little nanobots to from like the 
most reputable company,

1137
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:38,381
you know,
the one that you really like and the 

1138
00:52:38,381 --> 00:52:38,381
great user agreement.
And then,

1139
00:52:38,381 --> 00:52:41,440
but then after it's in you,
it's like they get bought by google and 

1140
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:41,720
all of a sudden your user agreement 
shifted,

1141
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,300
you know,
agree to,

1142
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,110
you know,
do you want to have,

1143
00:52:45,111 --> 00:52:45,840
you know,
uh,

1144
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,440
do you want to remember your children's 
names?

1145
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:54,190
Okay.
Then sign that's used this new user 

1146
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:54,190
agreement.

1147
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,090
Otherwise you get no's.
No data.

1148
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:59,030
You have enough for two people to phone 
numbers.

1149
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:04,030
Your emergency 911 phone,
like your phone.

1150
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:07,490
It's not registered at only relate to 
call nine.

1151
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:09,020
One one.
That'll be the same thing.

1152
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,550
Well,
you should've paid your bill,

1153
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:15,610
Mr Rushkoff.
I don't know why he didn't want to pay 

1154
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:15,610
your bill and here you are with no 
recourse.

1155
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,710
Yeah,
you're going to look at a shiny guy from

1156
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:21,200
the future of thousand years old and it 
looks great,

1157
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,120
but again,
it'd be all artificial.

1158
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:23,780
Yeah,
but again,

1159
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,660
it's not with all that artificial knees.
It's not necessarily,

1160
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:32,661
although it may be it,
it's not necessarily the technology 

1161
00:53:32,661 --> 00:53:35,121
that's the problem in this equation.
You're the company that owns the 

1162
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:35,280
technology,
right,

1163
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:38,310
but ultimately what's getting done,
the technology's getting pushed.

1164
00:53:38,311 --> 00:53:43,311
That seems to be the case in every 
single situation and ultimately at the 

1165
00:53:43,311 --> 00:53:47,631
top of the execution food chain where 
you look at like what is being done at 

1166
00:53:47,631 --> 00:53:47,631
the end level.

1167
00:53:47,631 --> 00:53:50,700
That's really the game changer.
The technology constantly increases with

1168
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:55,701
every overtake,
with every new gigantic invention and 

1169
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,340
bundles of money that go along with it 
and all the people that got fucked over.

1170
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:04,341
At the end of the day,
the technology keeps moving forward and 

1171
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:04,880
it keeps getting stronger and stronger 
and stronger and it's.

1172
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,160
But it's not just stronger that it's,
it's,

1173
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,030
it's fundamentally different.
I mean,

1174
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:11,670
that's the thing that Mcluhan was trying
to bring up in Marshall Mcluhan,

1175
00:54:11,671 --> 00:54:13,320
the media theorist.
He was looking at that,

1176
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,450
the different environments that 
different media,

1177
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:17,950
different kinds of technology create.
So you know,

1178
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,870
fire had a change.
They had a media environment,

1179
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:23,340
had a technological environment with 
fire.

1180
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:28,341
Now you know,
people could go live further north in 

1181
00:54:28,341 --> 00:54:29,280
colder places and little apes,
you know,

1182
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:34,340
who were smart enough to have fire,
could get away from big dumb apes who 

1183
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:34,410
couldn't travel north to chase them.

1184
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:39,410
You know,
we got different races and all sorts of 

1185
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,911
things happen because it's sounding like
fire or the invention of text or the 

1186
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:45,171
invention of text changed.
Well for me it changed the way we look 

1187
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:45,171
at time,
right?

1188
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:49,491
Because now I can write something now 
that I'm going to be accountable for 

1189
00:54:49,491 --> 00:54:49,830
later.
So we can have contract with text.

1190
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:54,831
We got history,
we got the Judeo Christian line of 

1191
00:54:54,831 --> 00:54:57,180
thought.
We got law and ethics,

1192
00:54:57,181 --> 00:54:59,070
you know,
we got our,

1193
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,970
we got the calendar,
you know,

1194
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:03,510
then that all went along and we 
developed.

1195
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,570
Then we get the printing press and we 
get the clock right now,

1196
00:55:06,571 --> 00:55:07,800
the clock,
all of a sudden we go,

1197
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:12,801
oh wow.
Now we can actually break down the day 

1198
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:14,571
into these little pieces.
We put one up at the town square and 

1199
00:55:14,571 --> 00:55:14,610
that's when time became money.
That's what it was like,

1200
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:19,611
okay,
now you can work for an hour for me 

1201
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:19,611
instead of making a thing that you're 
connected to and selling it to me,

1202
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:21,150
now you can work for the hour or two 
hours or three hours.

1203
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:24,480
We got to standard and now we get the 
digital media environment,

1204
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:29,810
you know,
which is just as different as the 

1205
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:29,810
industrial age media environment.
That.

1206
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,290
And the clock was from the printing 
press,

1207
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,780
from the written text,
from,

1208
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:34,790
from,
uh,

1209
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:36,780
from even fire.
You know,

1210
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:39,280
and in the digital media environment,
there's this,

1211
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,240
uh,
it's not just more tech,

1212
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,680
it's,
it's more,

1213
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,760
it's more of a sense of,
of moving through time and a choice.

1214
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,830
Two choice,
two choice two choice way.

1215
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:55,030
You know,
where we just have more choices than we 

1216
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,130
know what to do if we spend more time 
processing choice itself than we do.

1217
00:55:56,131 --> 00:55:58,290
Getting the things that we've chosen,
you know,

1218
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:03,070
it's like the call waiting is almost 
like the typical kind of digital choice.

1219
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,670
It just ended our,
I'm talking to this level and I've got a

1220
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:08,040
call waiting.
What do I do?

1221
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,750
You know,
just to be put in that,

1222
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:14,780
just to be put yourself in that,
in that interrupted state is very 

1223
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:18,741
digital because you want to have the 
choice because that person wants to 

1224
00:56:18,741 --> 00:56:18,741
reach you.

1225
00:56:18,741 --> 00:56:19,020
But how,
you know,

1226
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,210
how that interrupts what,
uh,

1227
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,680
what used to be a more continuous way 
of,

1228
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,700
of just moving through life.
Yeah.

1229
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:32,750
It,
it certainly gives us more options and 

1230
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,281
we're naturally designed to handle.
And the more people have on their 

1231
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:40,711
facebook page,
the more likely they really have zero 

1232
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:40,711
connection to those people.
The,

1233
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:41,590
the idea.
I mean like,

1234
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,900
like we're,
we're designed for Dunbar's number,

1235
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:46,030
right?
One hundred 50 people and you get,

1236
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,160
get 5,000
people on your facebook page.

1237
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:49,150
Well,
who the fuck does that mean?

1238
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:52,020
Who are you talking about marketing and 
you know,

1239
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,970
what,
what kind of interaction that you really

1240
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:55,700
happening,
you know,

1241
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,570
it's not the same.
It's not a human to human interaction.

1242
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,430
The other weird thing that facebook for 
me,

1243
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:02,080
again,
it's how it compresses time,

1244
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,630
so it's like there are these people from
like second and third grade.

1245
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,070
I'm finally,
you know,

1246
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:11,100
45,
whatever years away from that and then 

1247
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,880
it's like two weeks ago from second 
grade,

1248
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,550
it's like,
God,

1249
00:57:14,551 --> 00:57:16,840
I'd finally,
I'd left that behind me.

1250
00:57:16,841 --> 00:57:17,480
It's unmarked.
Yeah.

1251
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:20,350
I don't know who she is.
It's I was or who she relates to.

1252
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:25,351
It's just,
it was in the past for a reason and now 

1253
00:57:25,351 --> 00:57:29,611
it's here,
but then on the front end I've got the 

1254
00:57:29,611 --> 00:57:31,891
computer on the other side,
calculating everything about my 

1255
00:57:31,891 --> 00:57:33,640
keystrokes so they know my future.
They know who's going to be pregnant,

1256
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:34,480
who's going to be gay,
who is going to be,

1257
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:35,590
this can be that.
There was like,

1258
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:40,650
okay.
So it was like my past is all in here 

1259
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,900
and now my future is all in here and 
everything's just sort of crushed in on 

1260
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:42,900
me there.
I don't feel.

1261
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,540
I don't feel autonomous anymore.
I don't feel like I have agency.

1262
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:51,540
I don't feel I'm in charge.
I can't get away from anything and I 

1263
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,990
can't actually be moving towards 
anything with a sense of free will,

1264
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,960
but can you.
I mean you're,

1265
00:57:55,961 --> 00:57:59,800
you're sort of in control of how much to
interact with it,

1266
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:03,490
how much you choose to use it.
That's why I dropped facebook.

1267
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:04,880
You dropped it.
I was just like,

1268
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,900
too much.
But you still use twitter?

1269
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:08,970
Yeah.
What?

1270
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:10,130
What's there?
Stays there.

1271
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,330
Facebook problematic.
Facebook is a problem that will.

1272
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:18,040
A real problem with facebook is I'm not 
in charge of what I do on facebook.

1273
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:22,720
Why is that?
Because Mark Zuckerberg can use me or my

1274
00:58:22,721 --> 00:58:26,180
likeness in an ad of something that I 
don't even know what it is.

1275
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,990
He can't do that anymore than I thought.
Oh really?

1276
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:34,020
He undid that.
I think that was something that wasn't 

1277
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:34,020
supposed to happen.
Supposedly.

1278
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,080
Are they backtracked about that?

1279
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,330
They do.
They go two steps forward,

1280
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,100
one step back just to forward one step 
back.

1281
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:41,680
It's sort of an ever evolving user 
agreement.

1282
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:46,681
I mean,
we're the part that I had gotten 

1283
00:58:46,681 --> 00:58:46,681
concerned about what?
I'm on there as an author.

1284
00:58:46,681 --> 00:58:46,681
Right.
I'm on there,

1285
00:58:46,681 --> 00:58:47,830
buy my book.
Love me.

1286
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:49,270
You know,
and like my ideas,

1287
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,930
um,
I can't do that.

1288
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:56,590
I can't solicit the likes of other 
people have readers,

1289
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:00,820
people who I'm supposedly a advising 
about this stuff,

1290
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,570
especially about sort of media ethics 
and integrity.

1291
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:09,690
I can't invite them to like my page when
that very active liking is making them 

1292
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:14,641
vulnerable to marketing,
that's going to be passing through me 

1293
00:59:14,641 --> 00:59:19,470
beyond my control.
Yes and no because they're also 

1294
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:23,521
providing you with this excellent 
connection with all these people that's 

1295
00:59:23,521 --> 00:59:25,220
available through facebook,
which not as limited as twitter with 140

1296
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:30,221
characters.
I'm willing to pay for the privilege to 

1297
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:32,951
reach those people,
but I'm not willing to have them and 

1298
00:59:32,951 --> 00:59:36,830
their likenesses used to represent 
things.

1299
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:41,830
I don't think that they understand that.
What liking makes someone vulnerable to,

1300
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,730
you know?
I don't think so.

1301
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:48,731
I mean on some senses is patronizing.
I guess what I'm saying is I think I 

1302
00:59:48,731 --> 00:59:49,130
know stuff about this technology that 
they don't.

1303
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:54,131
If they all knew really how this worked,
if they all knew the implications of 

1304
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:55,340
what they were doing,
then I would say,

1305
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,480
let's,
let's go for it.

1306
00:59:56,490 --> 01:00:01,490
But ultimately the worst consequences is
what marketing they're going to be 

1307
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:05,261
marketed to going to be represented.
So their image would then be put on 

1308
01:00:05,261 --> 01:00:05,261
something.
Oh,

1309
01:00:05,261 --> 01:00:06,190
so,
but no,

1310
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,050
I'm pretty sure that I'm 100 percent 
sure they didn't.

1311
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:11,810
They dropped that thing of using their 
photos and advertising.

1312
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:16,820
And you're not going to profit.
They're not allowed to just take your 

1313
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:16,820
photos and just,
uh,

1314
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:17,500
just photos.
No,

1315
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:22,540
they're not going to do it.
With your photos that you're talking 

1316
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:22,540
about is,
are you talking about the photo,

1317
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:26,690
the photo thing they bought?
I'm talking about using,

1318
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:32,040
but for,
you were saying like using it for 

1319
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:32,960
advertising sponsored stories and how 
they use people in a sponsored story.

1320
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,910
At least the day that I quit at that 
point it would not.

1321
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,070
Oh,
you can turn that off.

1322
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:37,630
But yeah,
that,

1323
01:00:37,631 --> 01:00:42,631
that,
that there's things like that that are 

1324
01:00:42,631 --> 01:00:42,631
on,
but there's ways

1325
01:00:42,631 --> 01:00:42,631
turn them off.
I'm confused.

1326
01:00:42,631 --> 01:00:45,200
There are sponsored story,
but do you mean people don't know?

1327
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:47,420
I feel like most people don't know and 
just to be there,

1328
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:52,490
it just didn't seem like it also because
I so don't trust who they are.

1329
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:53,990
And what they're,
what they're about.

1330
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:57,410
I don't trust them as a company the way 
I want to trust the kinds of companies I

1331
01:00:57,411 --> 01:01:02,411
let get bigger and bigger and deeper and
deeper into my lives and eventually put 

1332
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:05,441
probes in my brain and do not trust them
because Justin timberlake played him in 

1333
01:01:05,441 --> 01:01:06,210
a movie.
The other one,

1334
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:10,420
he played a Shauna to put the good guy.
No,

1335
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:15,460
he played the mindspace story and how 
much of it is about coke and horse for 

1336
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:18,090
her,
because I would have with those guys and

1337
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,870
they just take that money crazy.

1338
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,990
If you're going to take facebook,
if you're going to say you,

1339
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:25,590
I don't trust facebook.
You can't trust twitter.

1340
01:01:25,591 --> 01:01:28,170
You can't trust google.
You can't trust any of the snow.

1341
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:33,850
I'm aware right now I'm aware of the 
ways that twitter is broadcast.

1342
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:38,900
I feel in control of how I'm tweeted and
retweeted.

1343
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:39,880
Almost

1344
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,880
worse though,
because they're actually to the point 

1345
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:44,880
where you try to go back in time and 
your timeline.

1346
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,530
You can see there gets a cutoff point 
where you can't download your own tweets

1347
01:01:49,601 --> 01:01:54,601
unless you know the exact link.
Then they end up giving you your 

1348
01:01:54,601 --> 01:01:54,601
history.
They said,

1349
01:01:54,601 --> 01:01:58,150
I still can't do it on mine,
and that's the same with like twit picks

1350
01:01:58,151 --> 01:01:59,810
are all these photo ones,
like some of them.

1351
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,420
Now you're saying that some inches.
Okay.

1352
01:02:01,421 --> 01:02:06,421
You're saying that you want your.
If you're going to do tweets you want or

1353
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,580
should have been an addition for your 
free,

1354
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,760
for your free tweeting.
You want them to maintain an archive of 

1355
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,830
you and everyone else.
Well,

1356
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,330
I'm,
I,

1357
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:21,340
I personally,
I personally don't have a problem with 

1358
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:21,340
it,
but when I'm saying

1359
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,890
is that that's kind of more ridiculous 
to me than facebook.

1360
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:24,890
The fact that I can't even access stuff 
that I've,

1361
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:29,400
that I've totally different thing I'm 
concerned about.

1362
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:31,540
I mean this is what in the book I call 
it digit Phrenia,

1363
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,330
you know,
I feel like the problem with,

1364
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:38,390
with digital for most people,
it's not this idea of information 

1365
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:41,271
overload,
that there's too much stuff coming at 

1366
01:02:41,271 --> 01:02:41,271
them,
but they're,

1367
01:02:41,271 --> 01:02:43,850
they can't maintain more than one online
persona a simultaneously.

1368
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:49,020
There's too many sort of individual 
instances of us and if you're going to 

1369
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:52,581
have different instances of yourself,
you know even your email inbox is an 

1370
01:02:52,581 --> 01:02:53,760
instance of a sort.
If you're gonna have all these different

1371
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,430
different things out there filling up or
interacting,

1372
01:02:56,610 --> 01:03:01,410
you want to be damn well sure that 
you're in charge of each one of them and

1373
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:06,411
I didn't feel.
I felt like facebook was now doing 

1374
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:06,411
things on my behalf.

1375
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:10,670
I was like one step of control.
When you make a very good point in that 

1376
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:14,370
having more than one version of yourself
becomes very problematic.

1377
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:16,530
Especially if you're involved in any 
like real.

1378
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:20,910
I mean I'm sure you probably interact 
with quite a few people every day and to

1379
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:24,600
do that on twitter's semi manageable.
Do it to do it when you can,

1380
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:27,030
but to do that on twitter and then they 
have to hop over to facebook too.

1381
01:03:27,031 --> 01:03:30,750
It's like you should have one portal in 
one portal.

1382
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:34,620
At least one.
That's one that I was always sad,

1383
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:35,520
you know,
because I don't really.

1384
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:40,550
I didn't go to facebook much.
I go there and they'd be like some 

1385
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:40,550
relative,
you know,

1386
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:40,550
who said,
oh,

1387
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:45,321
I just heard of your mom's passing.
It was like six months have gone by 

1388
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:48,111
before I found that message.
You don't want to console them or 

1389
01:03:48,111 --> 01:03:48,111
whatever.

1390
01:03:48,111 --> 01:03:48,740
Um,
it's,

1391
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,610
it's just such a,
it's for me,

1392
01:03:50,611 --> 01:03:52,980
it was such an awful interface anyway 
that I was just losing,

1393
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,900
losing stuff there.
But yeah,

1394
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:59,901
it's uh,
I don't think it's just has to do with 

1395
01:03:59,901 --> 01:03:59,901
how I get more,
uh,

1396
01:03:59,901 --> 01:04:00,810
uh,
correspondence from other people.

1397
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:03,060
So I've got a,
I've got to limit it more than others.

1398
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,100
I think it really has to do with,
um,

1399
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,180
well if anything,
it's at least I'm the canary in the cage

1400
01:04:09,181 --> 01:04:12,560
for what's coming for everybody else.
I mean,

1401
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:17,850
you know,
people will need to get one or two 

1402
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:17,850
emails and now it's just streaming in 
for everybody.

1403
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:19,230
Yeah.
If you send me something on Facebook,

1404
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:22,470
I don't read it just to let everybody 
know because they pile up.

1405
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,620
I don't have time to read them.
So I'm with you in a certain way.

1406
01:04:25,621 --> 01:04:29,400
I still use facebook to put up links,
but it's connected to my twitter and I'm

1407
01:04:29,401 --> 01:04:30,530
pretty cognizant of that.

1408
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:34,110
So when I put a tweet up on,
when I put a link up on facebook,

1409
01:04:34,111 --> 01:04:36,930
I make sure it's short enough to fit 
into a tweet with,

1410
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:37,990
with,
with,

1411
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:40,200
with twitter.
I mean you,

1412
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:45,260
you understand what you're putting out,
you put out this little hundred 40 

1413
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:48,621
things,
it went to your people and those words 

1414
01:04:48,621 --> 01:04:50,100
are out there.
It's like a tool like facebook.

1415
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:55,970
You don't really have the same sense of 
ownership over what's going and you 

1416
01:04:58,891 --> 01:05:00,720
don't have,
you don't actually have it.

1417
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,250
Right.
Your picture is used.

1418
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,440
Douglas went into starbucks just now.
Yeah.

1419
01:05:04,441 --> 01:05:07,530
I could turn it off so everyone should 
turn it off.

1420
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:10,200
So again,
you know,

1421
01:05:10,201 --> 01:05:12,360
it's like,
I feel like it's a useful,

1422
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,980
it's a useful tool,
but it's,

1423
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:18,130
it's a part of the untrustworthiness of

1424
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:21,310
a good portion of the net.
Yeah.

1425
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,800
Well,
I could see that with someone else being

1426
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:25,330
in control of the,
uh,

1427
01:05:25,331 --> 01:05:30,331
the,
the interaction and someone else being 

1428
01:05:30,331 --> 01:05:32,311
controlled ultimately of like when you 
sign a user agreement and you have all 

1429
01:05:32,311 --> 01:05:32,850
this information,
they just sort of put up online.

1430
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:37,860
You're,
you're entrusting it to them and then 

1431
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:37,860
turn their marketing to you.
I mean,

1432
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:40,780
that's a really good clean relationship 
as long as they don't fuck you.

1433
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:42,580
But yeah,
I mean,

1434
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:43,710
and there's a point at which,
you know,

1435
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,780
I'm all,
I'll let Netflix and it,

1436
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:50,740
whoever's in behind my TV remote.
I mean now they know all that stuff,

1437
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:51,580
right?
I mean,

1438
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:53,620
I'll let them craft commercials around 
me.

1439
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:54,570
It's like,
oh,

1440
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,950
I'll accept in this,
in this little,

1441
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,290
uh,
arrangement we have with business.

1442
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:01,000
I'll accept anything incoming,
you know,

1443
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,840
but don't use me for your outgoing know.

1444
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:06,880
Otherwise,
once you're taking the person's identity

1445
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:07,930
and then saying,
Oh,

1446
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,180
you know,
alice down the street like this,

1447
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:12,400
a Sitcom to,
you should watch that.

1448
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:17,520
And then my,
what I'm watching is getting broadcast 

1449
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:17,520
to them or what they think I'd be 
watching.

1450
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,670
That's where it starts to be like,
oh,

1451
01:06:18,671 --> 01:06:21,220
now I'm being disembodied,
now I'm being taken.

1452
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:27,150
I think it's facebook is one of the most
popular websites online and it's also 

1453
01:06:29,501 --> 01:06:34,501
one of the best ways to waste time,
like you can waste a day easily just 

1454
01:06:34,501 --> 01:06:36,550
looking at people that you used to have 
sex with you and I'll just fire them and

1455
01:06:36,551 --> 01:06:37,540
go,
what is this picture up to?

1456
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,780
Oh my goodness,
look,

1457
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,660
you know you could do that all day.
You go through that all day.

1458
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:45,430
That could be entertained and you're not
getting shit done.

1459
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:49,960
It's the same.
It's like I try to use twitter.

1460
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,020
I'm one of the things that I do with it 
is when we're.

1461
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,600
Whenever someone sends me something 
fascinating and a link,

1462
01:06:55,601 --> 01:07:00,601
I retweet it and because of that you 
become like a portal for cool shit and 

1463
01:07:01,181 --> 01:07:02,770
people know that if they send me cool 
shit,

1464
01:07:02,771 --> 01:07:06,940
I'll retweet it and so you get all this 
cool shit just starts coming to you.

1465
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:10,660
When you sort of have that idea and then
you send it,

1466
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:15,661
they send it to you and then it becomes 
this really exponentially expanding 

1467
01:07:15,661 --> 01:07:16,690
thing where you know,
you,

1468
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:21,130
you have this like a radio channel or,
or like an information dump.

1469
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,400
What percent of the tweets that you get 
do you think you would pass on?

1470
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:30,060
Um,
it's not that high percentage because 

1471
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:30,060
it's not always filter.
Well,

1472
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,990
I'll have to look at it,
you know,

1473
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,790
I mean if it's really interesting I'll 
look at it,

1474
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:35,140
but sometimes they'll send you something
and like,

1475
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,430
oh dude,
that's nonsense.

1476
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:37,050
Like,
what are you talking?

1477
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:39,490
Did you see where this came from?
Like you read the link,

1478
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:42,220
know that is not big foot and that guy's
refrigerator.

1479
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:44,350
Shut the fuck up and stop telling me 
this.

1480
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,050
But what that makes you a reliable.
A reliable filter.

1481
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,180
Yeah.
You can't just retweet things,

1482
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:53,320
but I do read occasionally if someone 
sends something really preposterous,

1483
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,630
will retweet it.
Just to see how people react.

1484
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,420
You know,
there's um,

1485
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,310
or if someone,
if people get mad at me,

1486
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:02,290
I'll retweet it just to see how they 
react.

1487
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:06,070
It just,
it's just we live in strange times.

1488
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,030
It's uh,
the,

1489
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:08,480
the,
the,

1490
01:08:08,481 --> 01:08:11,110
the twitter interface is a very bizarre 
one.

1491
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,350
The idea that you only give them 140 
characters and people abuse the shit out

1492
01:08:15,351 --> 01:08:20,351
of that.
Sometimes people will send me like 30 

1493
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:20,351
tweets in a row,
like explaining something to me,

1494
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:25,181
like to stop the,
of things like snapchat.

1495
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,440
You played with that or no,
what is that?

1496
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:29,870
The one where you take a picture and it 
like,

1497
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:33,410
you can send it but it dissolves in like
three seconds or five seconds.

1498
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:36,860
So it's like kids apparently.
I mean this is the dark secret.

1499
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,420
Kids are leaving facebook,
you know,

1500
01:08:38,421 --> 01:08:40,130
the,
the demographic,

1501
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:45,131
the younger like thing or in the 16 it's
like falling totally off and they're 

1502
01:08:45,131 --> 01:08:46,460
doing things like snapchat because they 
don't want,

1503
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,890
they don't want to be putting everything
they're doing on their permanent record.

1504
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:53,891
I mean they're finally kind of accepted 
that they can show someone they're 

1505
01:08:53,891 --> 01:08:53,891
posting.
It only lasts for three minutes.

1506
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:55,970
You screenshot it though and then you 
save it,

1507
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:57,470
upload it.
Well he knows,

1508
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,020
but if you screenshot it,
it at least tells them that they've,

1509
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:01,190
uh,
I mean,

1510
01:09:01,191 --> 01:09:04,580
so it's been defeated,
but if you screen save it,

1511
01:09:04,581 --> 01:09:08,180
they at least the person who sent you 
the thing knows that you did,

1512
01:09:08,181 --> 01:09:10,580
that they've given,
given their control.

1513
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:14,340
But yeah,
but just this quest for truly uh,

1514
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:20,150
Julie present based non archivable 
silliness,

1515
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:25,370
but it's because when we were silly we 
got to do in the parking lot of the 

1516
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:25,370
seven slash 11.
It's like,

1517
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,120
and there was no camera in the back 
either.

1518
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:28,850
It was really just it.
What happens in the standard seven,

1519
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:29,810
11,
seven,

1520
01:09:29,811 --> 01:09:30,530
11,
you know,

1521
01:09:30,531 --> 01:09:33,200
now it's like every single silly thing 
they did,

1522
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:35,570
if they didn't post about it,
their friend posted about it.

1523
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:36,920
So it was still up there.
And it's like,

1524
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:42,100
may as well.
We pitched passion to the side of the 

1525
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:42,380
Parthenon.
Not only that,

1526
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:47,381
but the ideas behind what you can and 
can't do or enforced by these archaic 

1527
01:09:47,451 --> 01:09:51,440
laws that were written when none of this
digital technology was available.

1528
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:54,560
So because of that,
he get a lot of weird shit happens.

1529
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:58,110
Like there's one girl who got charged 
with child pornography because shape,

1530
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:03,150
she was sending photos of her naked body
to boys in her class and so the cops 

1531
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:06,080
arrested her and charged this young 
girl.

1532
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:11,080
She was 15 years old with child 
pornography sending pictures.

1533
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,760
Yeah.
I mean you talk about losing the 

1534
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:16,760
scripts.
That's,

1535
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,350
that's really losing the script for 
life.

1536
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:20,630
I mean that was,
that is the nuttiest shit ever.

1537
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:21,010
You're,
you,

1538
01:10:21,011 --> 01:10:23,360
you,
you found a child porn king pin,

1539
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:25,880
right.
There happens to be a child.

1540
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:27,050
It was like,
yeah,

1541
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:28,640
exactly.
Zero tolerance son.

1542
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:32,600
It doesn't matter if she's a child,
but her vagina doesn't matter son.

1543
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:36,910
She's a criminal.
She's victimizing probation is rape.

1544
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,710
Exactly younger.
She's feeding the dark hunger,

1545
01:10:39,711 --> 01:10:42,380
so we need to discourage this in a big 
way.

1546
01:10:42,381 --> 01:10:47,381
Solitary confinement.
But that's really just a temporal lag 

1547
01:10:47,381 --> 01:10:47,381
hopefully.
Yeah.

1548
01:10:47,381 --> 01:10:49,730
So I think in our last then catch up,
are we.

1549
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:51,870
I mean,
and also,

1550
01:10:51,871 --> 01:10:54,920
I mean in some sense a lack of privacy 
could help that along too.

1551
01:10:54,921 --> 01:10:59,921
It's like if you know,
if Google cameras finding like tens of 

1552
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:03,221
thousands of people who are just smoking
joints in the streets of every American 

1553
01:11:03,221 --> 01:11:03,221
city,
you know,

1554
01:11:03,221 --> 01:11:03,890
some point they have to go,
okay,

1555
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:07,530
let people smoke pot,
let gays get married.

1556
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,950
Say yes,
except the pod thing.

1557
01:11:09,951 --> 01:11:13,320
There's money in enforcing it.
The biggest issue,

1558
01:11:13,321 --> 01:11:15,750
more money in enforcing it or being in 
selling it?

1559
01:11:15,751 --> 01:11:17,730
No,
but it would be two different people and

1560
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:22,731
you have to pry it from the hands of the
people that are making money by keeping 

1561
01:11:22,731 --> 01:11:27,471
it illegal.
Whether it's the private prison 

1562
01:11:27,471 --> 01:11:28,200
industry,
whether it's the prison guards unions,

1563
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:33,630
whether it's different pharmaceutical 
companies that would stand to lose 

1564
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:33,900
profits,
whatever.

1565
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:37,710
There's gonna be a bunch of people that 
are trying to stop anything,

1566
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:40,980
any change,
especially changes in legalities because

1567
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:44,950
there's a big business in locking people
up for shit I know,

1568
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,960
so they're going to have to maintain a,
an illegal population to stay alive.

1569
01:11:51,661 --> 01:11:56,661
They're going to have to rest more and 
more if they're going to have corporate 

1570
01:11:56,661 --> 01:11:58,731
growth.
Greater greater percentage of America 

1571
01:11:58,731 --> 01:11:59,610
has to be in prison every single year 
until it's an Asam Tata curb and there's

1572
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:00,390
one guy left.

1573
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,310
That becomes a really interesting 
scenario.

1574
01:12:02,311 --> 01:12:06,180
If marijuana does become legal and you 
can trade on the future of marijuana,

1575
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,200
what the fuck man,
I want.

1576
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,450
It does have it.
There are some stocks that are marijuana

1577
01:12:12,451 --> 01:12:15,810
stocks really at that people trade.
How is that possible?

1578
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:21,390
Well,
they're the companies that I guess that 

1579
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:22,680
I've already laid out a marijuana 
strategy or are they ready for it?

1580
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:28,190
Look at that percentage of the US prison
population that are non violent drug 

1581
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:33,021
offenders in the 1980 and then in 2012 
percent and in 2012,

1582
01:12:33,781 --> 01:12:35,520
it's 25 percent.
Yeah,

1583
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:38,040
the war on drugs folks,
they're winning.

1584
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:43,400
More people are in jail I guess is.
I mean they're winning and no,

1585
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:46,500
as long as we have a private prison 
system,

1586
01:12:46,501 --> 01:12:49,020
it's good for the economy,
the whole thing.

1587
01:12:49,021 --> 01:12:51,510
It's fucking bananas.
Just the.

1588
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:56,700
The fact that in this day and age you 
still can't make a logical argument as 

1589
01:12:57,121 --> 01:12:59,460
to why certain things are legal and 
illegal.

1590
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:02,940
Certain things that are legal,
which are devastating to your health,

1591
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:08,120
and then when you find out that 
information has been withheld and that 

1592
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,380
companies may have new known about 
certain risks,

1593
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:13,410
no one seems to go to jail if anything 
happens,

1594
01:13:13,411 --> 01:13:18,411
people get find a little bit.
But if that was an individual person 

1595
01:13:18,411 --> 01:13:18,411
that did that,
oh my God,

1596
01:13:18,411 --> 01:13:21,270
there would be a horrible human being,
a personal person.

1597
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:25,950
One person who's responsible for all the
deaths that came from aspirin alone.

1598
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,440
You would want to add what's.
That's why there's some,

1599
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,050
there's some ways to get more conscious 
of it though,

1600
01:13:31,051 --> 01:13:32,160
because it's all of us,
right?

1601
01:13:32,161 --> 01:13:35,220
It's all of us who are part of that 
system are owning that corporation,

1602
01:13:35,221 --> 01:13:37,890
has shareholders or whatever.
And there are these things like,

1603
01:13:37,891 --> 01:13:42,891
um,
have you ever seen that slavery 

1604
01:13:42,891 --> 01:13:42,891
footprint Dot Org?
No,

1605
01:13:42,891 --> 01:13:42,891
it's a,
it's a fun website.

1606
01:13:42,891 --> 01:13:44,580
You got to do it when you're feeling 
good about yourself though.

1607
01:13:44,581 --> 01:13:45,490
What it does is,
um,

1608
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:46,790
uh,
you,

1609
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,690
you put in everything that you own.
If you have a car,

1610
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:54,720
not where you live and this and that,
and it calculates how many slaves are 

1611
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,510
working for you right now.
God and like with like whatever.

1612
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:58,300
Getting that.
Yeah.

1613
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:01,890
Getting the Molybdenum for your iphone 
or whatever it is or you know,

1614
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:06,270
losing their fingers in some molybdenum,
molybdenum,

1615
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:09,480
Molybdenum to metal.
Is it a rare,

1616
01:14:09,481 --> 01:14:10,620
rare metal?
Wow.

1617
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:14,260
I never that one.
I've just recently heard a cold Tan.

1618
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:17,730
That's the stuff that they get in the 
Congo than for self.

1619
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:23,100
Something that's really good with 
activity or something to do with the 

1620
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,060
electronic connectivity in the use of 
cell phones.

1621
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:26,590
So it's,
I've,

1622
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:31,591
I've found that to be so bizarre and one
of the more bizarre things in life that 

1623
01:14:31,591 --> 01:14:34,670
the most complex stuff that we use,
like cell phones,

1624
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:37,480
computers,
that the very base of it,

1625
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:39,130
the origins early,
there's a mine,

1626
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:40,510
there's a hole in the ground.

1627
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:46,340
Also human suffering,
which is why I don't like the idea that 

1628
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:50,281
my computer,
which could really do everything I 

1629
01:14:50,281 --> 01:14:53,671
needed to do is rendered obsolete by 
changes in operating systems that really

1630
01:14:54,341 --> 01:14:56,470
are unnecessary except to sell another 
computer.

1631
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,540
You know,
the difference does not,

1632
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:03,760
uh,
but I don't think necessarily because 

1633
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,911
they're trying to continue to improve 
the product and they're continuing to 

1634
01:15:05,911 --> 01:15:09,031
add more functionality and believing 
that or at least at the rate at which 

1635
01:15:09,031 --> 01:15:10,170
they do.
I sometimes feel like there's a,

1636
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:15,320
a,
it used to be sort of windows and Intel 

1637
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,090
that you know,
windows and make it complex operating 

1638
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:18,090
systems so that you'd have to get the 
next intel chip and then Intel would,

1639
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:20,620
we'd create a tweak on that.
That makes you the next,

1640
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:25,940
uh,
next Windows operating system that they 

1641
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:26,990
sort of would leapfrog each other.
And it feels like that with them.

1642
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:27,940
Yeah.
You know,

1643
01:15:27,941 --> 01:15:28,540
you're,
you're,

1644
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,820
yeah,
you're iphone is better things now.

1645
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:35,821
Then three iphone to go.
But what about all these iphones in the 

1646
01:15:35,821 --> 01:15:40,080
garbage and all these people who lost 
all this stuff and the amount of time 

1647
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,400
compressed into one of these,
one of these devices is really intense.

1648
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:45,220
You know that,
that at least one of our,

1649
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:50,221
our,
our goals when we're developing new 

1650
01:15:50,221 --> 01:15:50,221
technologies and new technology pathway 
should be,

1651
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:55,370
well,
what's the one that's going to actually 

1652
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:55,870
require the sales of the lease up,
the fewest amount of computers.

1653
01:15:55,871 --> 01:15:58,900
I don't know how many people are going,
how could we sell?

1654
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,170
How could we need to sell less computer 
so that we're,

1655
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:03,040
you know,
people don't have to throw out these old

1656
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:05,380
ones.
Have you seen those photos of Cuba,

1657
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,880
of the old cars?
Because Cuba doesn't get new cars.

1658
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:14,370
They have cars from like the fifties and
sixties and they are gorgeous.

1659
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:17,110
They're beautiful,
but they do drive like shit.

1660
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:22,320
That's the problem.
If you drive like a modern day BMW and 

1661
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,310
then you go back to willow,
stupid Chevy's from the 19 fifties,

1662
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,520
those things are dog shit.
They break terrible.

1663
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:32,521
They,
they handle like a horse on roller 

1664
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:32,521
skates.
Their ridiculous cars.

1665
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:36,600
They're so stupid.
We know how to be thrown into rebel 

1666
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:36,600
without a cause today.
And you hopped in that car.

1667
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,600
It will not be that.
It wouldn't be.

1668
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:39,490
The experience were thinking.
They're talking shit.

1669
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:42,460
They're terrible.
You could with a prius,

1670
01:16:42,461 --> 01:16:45,490
you could easily get away from some guy 
in a 55 chevy.

1671
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:49,360
There's no way you keep up.
Those things are terrible.

1672
01:16:49,361 --> 01:16:53,470
They can't take corners.
The breaks of his stupid drum brakes.

1673
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:58,650
I mean they might as well have a rock 
that you throw out that's attached to a 

1674
01:16:58,650 --> 01:16:58,650
rope to slow your car.
Tell you,

1675
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:02,010
take a.
You take a 57 t bird over a segue.

1676
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,240
Yes,
yes.

1677
01:17:04,241 --> 01:17:06,910
Over just because it could rain.
Okay.

1678
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,460
I liked the idea that,
you know,

1679
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:16,540
they've managed to recycle these cars 
and keep them working and keep them 

1680
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:19,280
running and it's really cool to see it 
aesthetically.

1681
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:20,570
It's beautiful.
It's gorgeous.

1682
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:25,600
I mean you see a,
a modern street in this day and age and 

1683
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,991
you see these beautiful like,
and you can tell they're proud people 

1684
01:17:28,991 --> 01:17:32,561
because these are shiny cars.
They're painted nice and they're done 

1685
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:34,760
well and they're restored well or,
or at least maintained well.

1686
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:40,030
I mean,
I don't know how many miles some of 

1687
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:40,030
these cars have on them,
but they do look,

1688
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,260
it does look amazing.
I know there is that,

1689
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:46,250
you know,
I feel like there's a hunger for stuff,

1690
01:17:46,251 --> 01:17:51,251
not just fifties,
but also started to sixties madmen 

1691
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:51,860
period that this Dahlia for that,
so that,

1692
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,980
that's right before this digital age 
started.

1693
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,010
That's like the height of the TV agents,
you know,

1694
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:59,930
putting satellites in space.

1695
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,940
There was that innocence,
you know,

1696
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:07,110
you know,
it's funny because people look at these 

1697
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,110
kinds of shows and say,
Oh,

1698
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,910
you know,
aren't they a Tibet,

1699
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:08,910
Tibet there,
uh,

1700
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:09,710
you know,
decadence.

1701
01:18:09,711 --> 01:18:10,310
And I was like,
no,

1702
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:12,110
it's about their innocence,
you know,

1703
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:14,150
they believe in,
they got,

1704
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:16,100
you know,
it's that,

1705
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:17,690
you know,
and you go around La,

1706
01:18:17,691 --> 01:18:22,691
it's like everybody's got hayward 
Wakefield in their house and trying to 

1707
01:18:22,691 --> 01:18:23,510
get those old g frigerators with this 
sort of rounded coverage.

1708
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:25,870
You know,
there's that longing for a,

1709
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:28,340
like the industrial age just feels so 
real.

1710
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:30,770
You know,
it's a solid when people made stuff,

1711
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:32,840
you know,
it wasn't just kind of printed,

1712
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:34,010
right?
Yeah.

1713
01:18:34,011 --> 01:18:36,980
There's that,
that also like when you see those cars,

1714
01:18:36,981 --> 01:18:40,100
there's such a human element in that old
stuff.

1715
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:45,400
Like even like sixties muscle cars,
like those were sort of like human 

1716
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,850
created works of art as opposed to,
you know,

1717
01:18:46,851 --> 01:18:49,160
you look at like a new Mazda or 
something like that,

1718
01:18:49,161 --> 01:18:54,161
a real modern car and they're like,
it looks like something that just came 

1719
01:18:54,161 --> 01:18:54,161
out of a machine.

1720
01:18:54,161 --> 01:18:55,700
They screwed it together and came out of
a machine.

1721
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,480
You looked at like a 69 chevy that 
doesn't like a Chevy Camaro.

1722
01:18:59,481 --> 01:19:04,481
Sixty nine Camaro.
That's something somebody fucking 

1723
01:19:04,481 --> 01:19:04,880
screwed together.
There's some men work in behind that.

1724
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:09,200
There's some people put tires on the 
wheel and bolted in place.

1725
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:11,450
There's some guys who work some 
wrenches.

1726
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:16,451
There's no doubt about it.
You look at that thing that's a 

1727
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:17,870
mechanical creation.
It's not a a computer creation and we're

1728
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:22,871
slowly moving towards the Prius and I'm 
fine with computer creation aesthetic if

1729
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:28,910
it means that we don't have to work,
they didn't.

1730
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:35,140
So they get rid of all those guys,
screw it in the screws and then let them

1731
01:19:35,601 --> 01:19:38,800
stay in their houses.
Fuck ended up,

1732
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:43,900
fuck.
Those guys have to pick up a lot of 

1733
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:43,900
work.
They have to evolve with the times.

1734
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:44,780
That's the whole thing too.
It's like,

1735
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:45,800
so now we have.

1736
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,630
The big problem in America is 
unemployment.

1737
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:49,580
Obama talking about getting jobs,
jobs.

1738
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:53,090
Jobs are people who wants a job.
I don't want a job.

1739
01:19:53,091 --> 01:19:54,620
You don't want to jump.
People don't want jobs.

1740
01:19:54,621 --> 01:19:57,680
People want this stuff that you get when
you have a job.

1741
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:59,870
They want the money that you get for 
having a job,

1742
01:19:59,871 --> 01:20:01,070
but they don't want the jobs.
Right?

1743
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,830
So meanwhile though,
we've got more than enough stuff.

1744
01:20:03,831 --> 01:20:06,470
We're burning food every week,
so you keep market prices high.

1745
01:20:06,471 --> 01:20:11,471
We're tearing down.
Bank of America is tearing down houses 

1746
01:20:11,471 --> 01:20:11,471
in California because they're in 
foreclosure.

1747
01:20:11,471 --> 01:20:14,700
You can't just let someone live in it.
It's going to bring price down.

1748
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:16,590
They tear them down.
Why did they tear them down?

1749
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:21,710
Because they're there.
Would have to sell at distressed prices 

1750
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:25,161
that would then lower prices of other 
properties that they're trying to keep 

1751
01:20:25,161 --> 01:20:26,570
up.
What it would cost them more money.

1752
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:30,620
If you own 10 houses in a town and one 
isn't going to sell,

1753
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:35,640
you'd rather a tear it down.
Then if the bank comes along and create 

1754
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,980
some sort of a program to give houses to
needy people,

1755
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:40,680
then it's going to lower the real estate
values of the,

1756
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,620
of the mortgages that they've invested 
in that are already teetering.

1757
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:47,070
So they can't do that.
So charity itself becomes unprofitable.

1758
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:51,540
It's never been quite profitable,
but that's like less than unpalatable.

1759
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:56,580
What if we figured out that okay,
we only need rather than having 

1760
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:59,751
everybody work 40 hour weeks,
which is based on a clock and the 

1761
01:20:59,751 --> 01:21:02,601
industrial age,
how much can we have people working at 

1762
01:21:02,601 --> 01:21:02,601
weekend?
What if people don't really have to work

1763
01:21:02,601 --> 01:21:03,360
that much for us to have everything we 
want?

1764
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:05,730
But what if 10 percent of people could 
work,

1765
01:21:05,731 --> 01:21:10,731
you know,
two days a week and we get everything 

1766
01:21:10,731 --> 01:21:10,731
right?

1767
01:21:10,731 --> 01:21:10,731
So you go in,
you do your work.

1768
01:21:10,731 --> 01:21:11,590
I'm going to do my work in April 2007,
you know,

1769
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,770
and then I'm going to go again in March.
What if it got that?

1770
01:21:13,771 --> 01:21:18,771
You really didn't need everybody working
all the time for everybody to have 

1771
01:21:18,771 --> 01:21:19,230
stuff.
We couldn't deal with that.

1772
01:21:19,231 --> 01:21:22,050
Not because we don't have technologies 
to do that.

1773
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:24,000
We can't deal with it because we don't 
have an economy.

1774
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:25,950
We don't know how to divvy up the 
spoils.

1775
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:31,210
You know the reason that you have a job 
is so that you can be entitled to a 

1776
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:31,560
share of what's actually in them in 
abundance,

1777
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:33,570
but because there's not enough jobs for 
people,

1778
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:38,690
we've got to rip up stuff and ruin stuff
that's in abundance because we can't 

1779
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:42,831
give it out.
There's also the social issue of not 

1780
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:45,591
having jobs when people don't feel like 
they've made their own way or pulled 

1781
01:21:46,581 --> 01:21:47,400
their own weight.

1782
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,470
They feel unworthy,
they feel,

1783
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,860
but you gotta replace employment with 
work.

1784
01:21:55,861 --> 01:21:57,330
You know,
employment is a new invention.

1785
01:21:57,331 --> 01:21:58,200
Employment,
again,

1786
01:21:58,201 --> 01:22:03,201
industrial age.
We used to work for each other and 

1787
01:22:03,201 --> 01:22:03,201
ourselves.
We only got jobs when we got the clock.

1788
01:22:03,201 --> 01:22:06,300
When we could work on the clock,
then we're employed or but we don't have

1789
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:09,120
to be employed in order to work.
In order to have meaning.

1790
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:11,340
If you don't have to have your job,
you don't stop,

1791
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:14,700
so you just have to find a new niche 
into the system.

1792
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:19,710
You have to find a new thing that you 
contribute to your to the world.

1793
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:22,550
Yeah,
I completely agree with that,

1794
01:22:22,551 --> 01:22:27,551
but too many people find sort of a 
preexisting way to interact and they 

1795
01:22:28,261 --> 01:22:32,190
don't create their own way to interact 
and in doing so,

1796
01:22:32,191 --> 01:22:37,191
you oftentimes miss on one of the best 
things which is accomplishing things,

1797
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:42,620
whether it's accomplishing starting your
own restaurant and keeping it open and 

1798
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:46,221
in or having a car shop that only fixes 
a certain type of automobile that you 

1799
01:22:46,221 --> 01:22:47,340
really love to work on.

1800
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:50,610
You know when you can figure out a way 
to do something that you actually have a

1801
01:22:50,611 --> 01:22:52,280
passion for that.
It's like the the,

1802
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,720
the old cliche.
It stops becoming work.

1803
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:56,980
It just,
it becomes you're you.

1804
01:22:57,010 --> 01:23:02,010
You don't really have a job.
You have a thing that you love and 

1805
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,170
you're in flow at that point and how 
many people have that and that's problem

1806
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,900
is you can't have it in this kind of 
economy.

1807
01:23:07,901 --> 01:23:12,901
You can have it.
When you have this kind of education 

1808
01:23:12,901 --> 01:23:12,901
system,
you can have it.

1809
01:23:12,901 --> 01:23:15,050
What about just real naturally dull 
people that need to be pushed in certain

1810
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:16,330
directions,
but you know,

1811
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:21,360
so not everyone has to be the one that 
figures out how to do the new method of 

1812
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,090
biodynamic.
Rudolph Steiner farming on their organic

1813
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:30,240
community supported agriculture plant.
Someone can just go there and plant 

1814
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:35,360
plant carrots.
It's also the issue of how human beings 

1815
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,431
are raised in the first place,
which is so huge and not really 

1816
01:23:38,431 --> 01:23:38,431
addressed the.

1817
01:23:38,431 --> 01:23:42,830
The reason why some of these people fall
into these mindless jobs is because 

1818
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:45,110
never along the line of they've been 
stimulated neverland,

1819
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,800
one by their family,
by the school systems,

1820
01:23:47,801 --> 01:23:49,870
by their environment,
by their atmosphere,

1821
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:50,890
by their,
you know,

1822
01:23:50,891 --> 01:23:53,470
their fellow knuckleheads in their 
community.

1823
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:58,290
They're all just surrounded by people 
who are either likeminded or less or you

1824
01:23:58,291 --> 01:24:01,120
know,
or support it and you kind of fucked.

1825
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,660
And then when something comes along that
eliminates that job for that guy,

1826
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:09,661
that robot job when he was 45 years old 
or 50 years old and he has to start 

1827
01:24:09,661 --> 01:24:14,581
again and sort of reignite some sort of 
passion and curiosity or die off like a 

1828
01:24:14,581 --> 01:24:15,490
dinosaur.
And it's hard too,

1829
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,620
because he was liking the thing he did,
you know,

1830
01:24:17,621 --> 01:24:20,020
if he's a toll collector,
you know,

1831
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:22,480
and you get better and better at it and 
then you start,

1832
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:24,520
you know,
then test to see how many people you can

1833
01:24:24,521 --> 01:24:29,521
make eye contact with when you're 
getting the towels and the how many 

1834
01:24:29,521 --> 01:24:29,521
lives can you change with that?

1835
01:24:29,521 --> 01:24:29,521
I mean,
Gosh,

1836
01:24:29,521 --> 01:24:32,350
he can be that you could live the 
bodhisattva life as a toll collector.

1837
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,560
You know,
they take that away from him and it's 

1838
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:37,850
not just that he can't be retrained,
he doesn't have motivation,

1839
01:24:37,851 --> 01:24:42,851
you know what I mean?
It's not his fault that they broke his 

1840
01:24:42,851 --> 01:24:45,421
heart.
They should have a show where a guy's a 

1841
01:24:45,421 --> 01:24:47,590
toll collector and just see how he 
interacts with people and then give them

1842
01:24:47,591 --> 01:24:48,540
projects.
Like,

1843
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:53,580
today you're just going to casually 
mention your penis and let's see how 

1844
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:56,590
many people freak out back there.
Back to your reality roots.

1845
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:58,940
Yeah,
that'd be funny.

1846
01:24:58,941 --> 01:25:00,910
You do.
You have to do a toll collector.

1847
01:25:00,911 --> 01:25:02,480
You got to do it pretty fast.
Well yeah,

1848
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:07,980
that'd be a weird way to experiment how 
people interact when they don't have to.

1849
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:09,850
It was really quick.
You know,

1850
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:11,170
how many people treat you like shit?

1851
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:12,400
How many people were like,
how are you doing?

1852
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:13,240
What's going on?
Everything.

1853
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:14,220
Cool.
All right man.

1854
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:15,170
Take care of.
You know this.

1855
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,510
You're going to get a broad variety of 
the way people interacted with you.

1856
01:25:19,511 --> 01:25:22,900
I think that'll be kind of fun.
Wouldn't like hold up as a series,

1857
01:25:23,230 --> 01:25:26,530
but maybe a one hour special.
The tall guy.

1858
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:27,580
Yeah,
yeah,

1859
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:29,350
yeah.
Just have a guy and you have,

1860
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:32,770
we have to do like break it up with like
a sit down.

1861
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:38,120
Yeah,
the chairs and then have a discussion 

1862
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:38,120
about the last couple of ones that we've
seen and what it really means.

1863
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,700
People love that fast track thing now 
though,

1864
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:40,740
they won't,
don't want to pay it.

1865
01:25:40,741 --> 01:25:45,741
Totally want to put that little thing up
there and they just go through like New 

1866
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:49,890
York is one of the weirdest scenarios 
ever because somewhere along the line 

1867
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:51,280
they just decided to make people pay to 
get to the city.

1868
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:55,090
It used to be that they were paying to 
get the bridge built,

1869
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:58,990
but they paid that fucking thing off a 
long time ago.

1870
01:25:58,991 --> 01:26:02,500
Every bridge got paid off a long time 
ago,

1871
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:06,080
but revenue is so intoxicating.
They just kept with it.

1872
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:10,070
We can understand that in California 
because we don't really have a plate.

1873
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:12,080
We could get anywhere it was bitches 
were built,

1874
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:15,830
but now they got to all be rebuilt,
rebuilt.

1875
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:17,480
I understand.
Hudson bridge.

1876
01:26:17,481 --> 01:26:22,481
They were building and building and 
building and by the time they've 

1877
01:26:22,481 --> 01:26:22,481
finished they had to start rebuilding it
again.

1878
01:26:22,481 --> 01:26:25,280
It was that many years.
Two reasons why that's nonsense.

1879
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:30,470
The big one is,
is the dumbest way to make traffic.

1880
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:33,950
You have a spot where everyone has to 
stop on the way into the city.

1881
01:26:33,951 --> 01:26:38,951
That is so stupid.
When you are going from Long Island to 

1882
01:26:38,951 --> 01:26:41,870
Manhattan,
that is the most maddening shit to do at

1883
01:26:41,871 --> 01:26:42,950
8:30
in the morning,

1884
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:48,190
you want to fucking kill somebody 
because it's so stupid box.

1885
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,940
You should make people pay.
You know,

1886
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:54,860
either either you could justify the 
construction of the bridge,

1887
01:26:54,861 --> 01:26:59,861
the maintaining of the bridge,
but they should pay for through their 

1888
01:26:59,861 --> 01:27:02,111
taxes and that's it.
There shouldn't be a spot we have to 

1889
01:27:02,111 --> 01:27:03,860
stop because that's fucking dumb.
The only reason why you would want to do

1890
01:27:03,861 --> 01:27:08,861
that is you want to check cars for bombs
are nutty people or are you just trying 

1891
01:27:08,861 --> 01:27:09,200
to discourage?
Yeah.

1892
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:14,230
Well I guess maybe try to discourage,
get people onto the lirr and do rapid 

1893
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:19,091
transit the way God intended and 
discourage people from coming into the 

1894
01:27:19,091 --> 01:27:19,091
city because the easier it is to get 
into the city,

1895
01:27:19,091 --> 01:27:21,140
the more the traffic sucks and it sucks 
already.

1896
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:26,230
It's terrible when make it suck and then
charge for making it knapsack stuck.

1897
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:32,120
You can't fix the suck that way you just
suck $20.

1898
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:33,260
We'll give you the green light.

1899
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:35,900
Do you live in Manhattan now?
Do you live in New York?

1900
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:38,030
I live in New York.
I live in Westchester County.

1901
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:41,990
I lived in new Rochelle for a little bit
on Hudson.

1902
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:44,120
Oh yeah.
It's um,

1903
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:45,680
that's a,
that's a beautiful area.

1904
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,330
That's nice.
The whole Westchester.

1905
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,660
It's got some nice pots.
Yeah,

1906
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:53,270
it does.
It's a little snooty.

1907
01:27:53,271 --> 01:27:58,271
Some of it.
So there's a couple of towns in 

1908
01:27:58,271 --> 01:27:58,850
Westchester that kind of retained some 
little shit to reality,

1909
01:27:58,851 --> 01:28:01,120
you know,
it's not just westchester is a weird.

1910
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:03,830
It is though.
You'll be in a neighborhood where you're

1911
01:28:03,831 --> 01:28:08,831
seeing these mansions with these giant 
lawns and then you'll go a half a mile 

1912
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:13,190
and you're in the projects and projects,
so it's a little more.

1913
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:16,060
Jersey Jersey ask drive through the 
oranges.

1914
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:17,030
It's that.
It really,

1915
01:28:17,031 --> 01:28:18,590
you get that sense.
I mean,

1916
01:28:18,591 --> 01:28:23,150
most of Westchester is pretty a pretty 
affluent at this point,

1917
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:23,960
you know,
but you know,

1918
01:28:23,961 --> 01:28:25,830
it's not as affluent as Manhattan.

1919
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:28,560
Manhattan is the most affluent and.
Right,

1920
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:29,360
right.
Well,

1921
01:28:29,361 --> 01:28:30,090
yeah,
I mean you,

1922
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:33,350
if you're inside Bloomberg's bubble,
if you made it in there somehow,

1923
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,600
you know when you entered the apartment 
was Amelia and I,

1924
01:28:35,601 --> 01:28:37,970
you've got $10,000,000
of real estate or something,

1925
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:39,230
but um,
you know,

1926
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:41,720
anywhere else doesn't quite.
It's not quite that.

1927
01:28:41,721 --> 01:28:45,560
Those places are madness.
Those multimillion dollar apartments,

1928
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:50,780
like the way of living in the big city 
like that is so alien.

1929
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:55,790
It's only exists in Manhattan where you 
have so many people living in apartments

1930
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:59,120
and it creates a different community and
in,

1931
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:03,650
in the sense it's more than than Los 
Angeles.

1932
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:04,600
Oh,
it is.

1933
01:29:04,601 --> 01:29:06,610
I mean,
most things about it are,

1934
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:11,670
are kind of more consonant with our era 
in our digital economy and all that.

1935
01:29:12,071 --> 01:29:15,040
It's a better carbon footprint is stack 
people up like that,

1936
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:17,710
that they have everybody.
I'm in lawns and fertilizer and whatever

1937
01:29:17,711 --> 01:29:19,450
else they get in the suburbs.
So,

1938
01:29:19,451 --> 01:29:19,890
I mean,
it's,

1939
01:29:19,891 --> 01:29:21,790
it's,
it's good on,

1940
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:26,850
on most of those levels.
It's just New York itself is so crazy 

1941
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:27,040
expensive,
you know,

1942
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:30,130
through God knows what sort of real 
estate shenanigans are done.

1943
01:29:30,131 --> 01:29:33,400
That's what sort of then for me colors 
the,

1944
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:36,430
uh,
the experience of urban joy there,

1945
01:29:36,431 --> 01:29:39,870
you know,
there's no one is an artist or a writer.

1946
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:43,240
Regular of a regular means could live 
there.

1947
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:48,830
Yeah.
That's where it gets really crazy when 

1948
01:29:48,830 --> 01:29:49,290
you see a small apartment is like 3000 
bucks a month and you're like,

1949
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:51,180
okay,
that's just nuts.

1950
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:53,830
That means a guy who makes $50,000
a year,

1951
01:29:53,831 --> 01:29:56,640
it has to give up three quarters of his 
income to pay his fucking rent.

1952
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:57,810
That's not,

1953
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,320
that's right.
So it's like,

1954
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:01,330
I mean,
I don't know if you need crime,

1955
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:03,820
uh,
to make it better,

1956
01:30:03,821 --> 01:30:06,640
but you know,
you'd go back to the era of,

1957
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:08,040
you know,
Basquiat,

1958
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,150
he couldn't live in Manhattan and you 
know,

1959
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:16,200
none of that.
None of the folks from then one of the 

1960
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:16,200
ramones or.
Well they were queens actually,

1961
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:16,600
but uh,
you know,

1962
01:30:16,601 --> 01:30:20,000
or Warhol or any of his 42nd street.
The real.

1963
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,670
But that's the thing though,
it's like exhausting.

1964
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,070
It was criminal.
It was,

1965
01:30:24,071 --> 01:30:25,360
you know,
it was awful.

1966
01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:26,490
Terrifying.
Yeah.

1967
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:27,880
It was terrifying.
And yeah,

1968
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:30,160
there's certain,
some part that wax nostalgic,

1969
01:30:30,161 --> 01:30:33,340
but that's not a good old days that you 
really want to return to either.

1970
01:30:33,550 --> 01:30:38,550
It's just like,
how can you have a New York that works 

1971
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:41,440
and is still artistic and alive and 
vibrant and fertile and not have people,

1972
01:30:41,441 --> 01:30:42,510
you know,
getting stabbed in the stomach.

1973
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:45,230
Yeah.
And how can you have so many rich people

1974
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:50,231
live in together?
Because you have to be rich to live 

1975
01:30:50,231 --> 01:30:50,231
there.
I mean,

1976
01:30:50,231 --> 01:30:51,770
it's,
it's really difficult to pull off living

1977
01:30:51,771 --> 01:30:54,910
in Manhattan if you don't have at least,
you know,

1978
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:59,330
upper middle class income.
So yeah,

1979
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:01,100
it's a strange,
strange place.

1980
01:31:01,101 --> 01:31:03,350
Unlike any place in this country,
you know,

1981
01:31:03,351 --> 01:31:08,351
there's no place in the country that's 
so overvalued and you can get a decent 

1982
01:31:08,351 --> 01:31:11,441
apartment in San Francisco for half of 
what you'd spend on an apartment in 

1983
01:31:11,441 --> 01:31:12,860
Manhattan.
San Francisco now has gotten worse.

1984
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:15,640
Something one of those lists.
Well,

1985
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:20,680
look the worst.
There's some places outside of San 

1986
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:20,730
Francisco that are just insane.
Like we're,

1987
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:23,300
I'm near Stanford.
Uh,

1988
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:24,350
they have,
um,

1989
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:29,470
I think it's called Atherton.
So the highest real estate in the 

1990
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:29,470
country.
Uh,

1991
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:33,610
and you,
you look at these people that I know 

1992
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:36,011
have this house up,
there is an acre and a half is worth 

1993
01:31:36,011 --> 01:31:37,520
$15,000,000
to fucking look into this.

1994
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,440
I was like,
what are you talking about?

1995
01:31:39,441 --> 01:31:44,441
It doesn't make any sense,
but it's like everybody in that 

1996
01:31:44,441 --> 01:31:44,441
neighborhood is all.
They're all tech people.

1997
01:31:44,441 --> 01:31:49,060
They all,
they all made insane amounts of money 

1998
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:50,150
and the various tech bubbles and booms 
over the years and all that.

1999
01:31:50,151 --> 01:31:55,151
Google money's up there and all that.
Apple money's up there and there's just 

2000
01:31:55,151 --> 01:31:57,920
a lot of fucking people that have 
incredible amounts of cash up there.

2001
01:31:58,070 --> 01:31:59,830
So real estate,
they need houses.

2002
01:31:59,831 --> 01:32:04,831
This is what they live.
So real estate's through the fucking 

2003
01:32:04,831 --> 01:32:04,831
roof,
right?

2004
01:32:04,831 --> 01:32:06,180
Like you will look if you look at,
like I,

2005
01:32:06,181 --> 01:32:09,430
I enjoy doing that sometimes.
Like could I live in Phoenix?

2006
01:32:09,431 --> 01:32:10,370
Let's see what,
you know,

2007
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:15,380
what the neighborhoods are like in 
Phoenix and I'll go look at real estate 

2008
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:17,841
in Phoenix for a goof.
You look in Atherton and what's 

2009
01:32:17,841 --> 01:32:17,841
$11,000,000?
She'll like,

2010
01:32:17,841 --> 01:32:17,980
get the fuck out of here.

2011
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:22,980
That's $11,000,000.
Well they got to be bike distance from 

2012
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:26,220
facebook or wherever.
It's an amazing bubble of,

2013
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:31,260
of money.
And this strange one of really strange 

2014
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:34,771
one because again,
you go a mile over and we've stopped at 

2015
01:32:34,771 --> 01:32:35,740
this Wendy's and it was like a really 
sketchy Wendy's.

2016
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:41,160
Like really?
Like this place is kind of fucking dirt 

2017
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,760
baggish to be a mile away from a $15 
million dollar house.

2018
01:32:42,761 --> 01:32:45,460
Like it's so strange how there is no 
middle anymore.

2019
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,720
Yeah.
That sort of got,

2020
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:48,200
got,
got spun out in the,

2021
01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:52,030
in the spin cycle at the end of the day.
This industrial age here.

2022
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:57,440
Well you can't say there's none,
but I mean just and certainly a 

2023
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:57,440
diminished very little,
very little.

2024
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:58,610
But you know,
like you're saying no,

2025
01:32:58,611 --> 01:32:59,750
if,
if that,

2026
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,520
if that lower 98 percent or 99 percent,
whatever it is,

2027
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:08,940
a gets fed up enough,
it'll network with itself rather than 

2028
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:10,060
trying to get something down from the 
top.

2029
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:13,270
I don't even fed up.
It seems like we only act when we forced

2030
01:33:13,271 --> 01:33:15,370
to act.
We need a desperation.

2031
01:33:15,371 --> 01:33:15,980
We need,
you know,

2032
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:21,050
we need to have no options and then we 
move into this new stage of 

2033
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:21,050
understanding what the fuck.
The real problem.

2034
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:22,750
But that's.
And that's different.

2035
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:23,560
And again,
that's,

2036
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:28,620
that's the whole point of,
of being in the president of 

2037
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:31,411
presenteeism is that instead of going on
some Long March on some other 20th 

2038
01:33:31,411 --> 01:33:35,791
century movement or this eyes on the 
prize and just the means justify the 

2039
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:37,540
means battle to the future thing,
we go,

2040
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:39,430
screw all that.
We just want it now.

2041
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:41,320
We're gonna just do it.
That's what it was.

2042
01:33:41,321 --> 01:33:43,150
So encouraging about the occupy 
movement.

2043
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:45,190
What are your demands?
What do you want from us?

2044
01:33:45,191 --> 01:33:46,390
We didn't want anything from you,
you know,

2045
01:33:46,391 --> 01:33:47,770
it was like we're not going to stay at 
our demands.

2046
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:50,480
Were going to actually do this thing,
you know?

2047
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,530
And that's where,
again,

2048
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:53,600
we'll do what thing though,
there the real issue,

2049
01:33:53,610 --> 01:33:58,610
right?
To try to occupy the world in which we 

2050
01:33:58,610 --> 01:33:58,610
live.
I love,

2051
01:33:58,610 --> 01:34:01,120
I liked in the occupy movement to white 
blood cells.

2052
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:05,530
Like they recognize there's an issue and
they gather around it and you know,

2053
01:34:05,531 --> 01:34:08,300
it's like if calls attention to the 
issue and you know,

2054
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,500
they're,
but they,

2055
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:11,680
they're,
they're gathering around a six spot.

2056
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:14,770
I mean that they know there's something 
wrong here.

2057
01:34:14,771 --> 01:34:15,860
And so everybody's like,
oh,

2058
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:17,860
this is the spot,
it's all going down right there.

2059
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:21,910
They try to educate,
they do teach ends and learn about stuff

2060
01:34:21,911 --> 01:34:26,911
a lot.
A lot of people know more about these 

2061
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:28,951
issues now than did before.
And they see it as a super longterm 

2062
01:34:28,951 --> 01:34:29,290
project.
I mean,

2063
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:32,530
this year they did an occupied debt and 
the debt jubilee.

2064
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:34,540
So what they're doing is buying pennies 
on the dollar,

2065
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:36,600
the debt of people like you've got,
you know,

2066
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:38,370
health bills,
they can't pay and all that because it's

2067
01:34:38,371 --> 01:34:43,371
just owned by credit companies.
So they buy the debt and just believe 

2068
01:34:43,371 --> 01:34:43,371
it.
Wow.

2069
01:34:43,371 --> 01:34:43,371
So it's kind of cool,
you know,

2070
01:34:43,371 --> 01:34:48,270
they take $10 in relief,
like a thousand bucks a debt and it's 

2071
01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:48,270
well worth it.
That's interesting.

2072
01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:52,771
That's a great idea.
And I think that's a great community 

2073
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:56,221
idea that there's a lot of people out 
there that I have a spare $5 or a spare 

2074
01:34:56,221 --> 01:34:57,830
$10 you won't even think about.
But if you get of those people,

2075
01:34:57,831 --> 01:34:58,070
you can

2076
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:00,800
enact some real change and really help 
people.

2077
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:03,620
Um,
what do you think is like what,

2078
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:08,680
what is the best way besides podcasting,
besides books and besides having actual 

2079
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:12,320
conversations with people where you 
explore these ideas,

2080
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:17,650
what is,
what is the best way to get people to 

2081
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:20,291
understand that true happiness really 
does come from a sense of community 

2082
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:23,950
where one of the interviews that I saw 
with you,

2083
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:27,170
you were talking about your youth and 
you were talking about living in a place

2084
01:35:27,171 --> 01:35:32,171
where you all shared a large backyard 
and it became sort of a community thing 

2085
01:35:32,171 --> 01:35:36,311
where everybody would get together and 
have like a barbecue and then queens and

2086
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:41,771
we had,
it was like one barbecue pit at the end 

2087
01:35:41,771 --> 01:35:41,771
of the block that was just on all 
weekend.

2088
01:35:41,771 --> 01:35:44,030
That's when we were lower middle class.
My Dad got a better job.

2089
01:35:44,031 --> 01:35:46,390
We leave Queens,
we'd go to Larchmont in scarsdale.

2090
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:46,910
These,
you know,

2091
01:35:46,911 --> 01:35:48,340
these Westchester towns.
He.

2092
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:53,530
Yeah.
And it's like you don't barbecue with 

2093
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:53,530
the Joneses anymore,
you barbecue it against the Jones.

2094
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:55,430
It's like every single family has got 
its own,

2095
01:35:55,431 --> 01:35:59,480
like $300 a weber grill in the backyard 
and no one would think,

2096
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:04,650
you know,
it's like you can invite someone over I 

2097
01:36:04,650 --> 01:36:06,251
suppose,
but it's not that barbecuing was this 

2098
01:36:06,251 --> 01:36:08,351
solo family activity and I was thinking 
about as far as the grill company's 

2099
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:10,130
concern,
that's better.

2100
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:15,310
They'd rather everyone have a grill and 
nobody grilled together because then 

2101
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:17,000
they get to sell more grills,
you know,

2102
01:36:17,001 --> 01:36:18,420
but what it's like,
I've,

2103
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:20,210
I've looked in my,
uh,

2104
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,860
not the neighborhood I'm in now,
but never.

2105
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:26,900
I almost went to because like everybody 
on the block had a snowblower and I'm 

2106
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:30,431
thinking that's really weird.
There's like 10 houses with 10 

2107
01:36:30,431 --> 01:36:33,221
snowblowers.
How many snowbirds do you need per 

2108
01:36:33,221 --> 01:36:33,221
driveway?
It's like that.

2109
01:36:33,221 --> 01:36:36,380
Every two houses share one for every 
four houses shared one.

2110
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:41,620
Want to get up in the morning and you 
don't want to talk to Mr Johnson can use

2111
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:44,750
the snowblower first because you got to 
be at work at 7:30.

2112
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:48,210
You don't want to talk to Mr Johnson.
Is the phase a Douche bag?

2113
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:53,620
Maybe.
Maybe you should be able to have your 

2114
01:36:53,620 --> 01:36:55,001
own snowblower.
There isn't a huge bag is because he's 

2115
01:36:55,001 --> 01:36:56,070
working overtime to save up for that 
guy.

2116
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:04,600
Yeah.
Well there's not a lot of people that 

2117
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:07,961
are happy out there as the roads quote 
that most men live lives of silent 

2118
01:37:07,961 --> 01:37:12,371
desperation today.
Loud desperation and Marshall McLuhan's 

2119
01:37:12,371 --> 01:37:17,021
quote that humans are the sex organs of 
the machine world and that has this 

2120
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:21,230
desire to keep up with the Joneses.
You got to pay for those Weber grills,

2121
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,210
you know,
as the disconnects us,

2122
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:26,270
you know,
I walk in a room now and I feel it feels

2123
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:28,550
different when I see people sitting on 
their devices.

2124
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:33,700
You know,
you used to walk into a room with a 

2125
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:35,261
bunch of guys.
You walk in here and you guys have 

2126
01:37:35,261 --> 01:37:35,261
devices,
but you can feel the family,

2127
01:37:35,261 --> 01:37:38,710
you know,
you can feel you guys are on an animal 

2128
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:38,710
level in touch with each other's vibe.
Right?

2129
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:42,710
On whatever that subtle level is.
And I go into rooms now and I don't feel

2130
01:37:42,711 --> 01:37:47,711
the same group dynamic group presence 
than I used to even teach in a class,

2131
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:50,390
you know,
20 years ago versus going into one today

2132
01:37:50,391 --> 01:37:53,300
when everybody's reading what's going on
in there.

2133
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:55,880
It's just different.
I'm not saying it's worse,

2134
01:37:55,881 --> 01:37:56,060
so though

2135
01:37:56,060 --> 01:38:01,060
I think it's worse.
I'm a qualitatively different 

2136
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:02,820
experience.
They have more choice over what they do.

2137
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,860
They can divide their attention the way 
they want,

2138
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,080
they have more autonomy over all these 
things,

2139
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:12,081
but they're losing.
And maybe it's out there on the net 

2140
01:38:12,081 --> 01:38:12,270
somewhere.
Maybe by the time we're in the great,

2141
01:38:12,271 --> 01:38:14,710
great second life we reconnect,
but they're,

2142
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:19,750
they're missing a certain subtle animal 
contact that we don't yet fully 

2143
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:20,310
understand.
Maybe he just needs to be mitigated.

2144
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:25,311
Or maybe we need to just understand and 
explore like the ethics of a when to and

2145
01:38:27,271 --> 01:38:32,271
not to use cell phones when to and not 
to connect and encourage more connection

2146
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:34,860
and like let people know.
They're like,

2147
01:38:34,861 --> 01:38:36,990
look,
that is an impulse.

2148
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:42,050
Just like washing your hands too a or 
just like there's like a lack of 

2149
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:46,221
satisfaction in the satisfying or the 
completion of that impulse to check 

2150
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:47,280
twitter.

2151
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,630
You check your twitter checking twitter 
again,

2152
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:53,800
what are you getting out of that?
Why not pay attention to the person 

2153
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:56,121
who's in front of you but you're doing 
it so like a nutty person washes their 

2154
01:38:56,121 --> 01:38:56,121
hands 100 times.
That's the whole point.

2155
01:38:56,121 --> 01:39:01,040
That's the whole reason I write in my 
books are that book before this one is 

2156
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,450
called program or be programmed and the 
idea was just to give people sort of the

2157
01:39:03,451 --> 01:39:08,451
10 biases of digital media.
Like they're really good for doing 

2158
01:39:08,451 --> 01:39:11,421
things far away.
They're not going to be doing things 

2159
01:39:11,421 --> 01:39:11,421
with someone in the same room because 
they're.

2160
01:39:11,421 --> 01:39:13,200
They're just really simple stuff like 
that or this time idea,

2161
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:16,710
which is that digital technologies 
asynchronous,

2162
01:39:16,711 --> 01:39:21,711
it doesn't live in time,
so don't you try to keep up with it 

2163
01:39:21,711 --> 01:39:22,410
because it's not in your temporal 
universe.

2164
01:39:22,411 --> 01:39:23,910
It's in its own,
you know,

2165
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:27,660
and you can make it conformed to yours,
but certainly don't run and chase it.

2166
01:39:27,690 --> 01:39:28,590
It's that.
It's kind of,

2167
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:31,500
it's at this point,
it's education,

2168
01:39:31,501 --> 01:39:34,080
it's just having the conversation 
letting people.

2169
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,040
That's the whole thing.
If they become more aware than you know,

2170
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:45,050
then they stand a chance.
I certainly think a lot of these things 

2171
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:47,991
is sort of snuck up on us and we could 
all do with a lesson or at least an idea

2172
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:52,200
of how to manage them more.
Right.

2173
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:53,830
More humanly.
Exactly.

2174
01:39:53,831 --> 01:39:58,831
In the trick is for people not to see it
and this has been my whole thing not to 

2175
01:39:58,831 --> 01:40:00,210
see the messenger of this as the one who
saying,

2176
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:01,560
oh,
this stuff's so bad.

2177
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:06,710
Oh,
well the children are turning more 

2178
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:06,710
violent.
You know,

2179
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:09,051
that whole kind of pbs ish hand wringing
thing that so many writers are out 

2180
01:40:09,391 --> 01:40:09,720
there.
It's like,

2181
01:40:09,721 --> 01:40:12,030
are you for technology or against it or 
for it or against it.

2182
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:13,350
You know,
and if you're not just going,

2183
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:14,730
Yay,
go business.

2184
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,320
They think you're against it.
And it's like,

2185
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:16,620
no,
no,

2186
01:40:16,621 --> 01:40:21,621
I'm for technology.
I'm just against the way were happened 

2187
01:40:21,621 --> 01:40:22,500
to be using it right now.
I don't think there's any.

2188
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:26,010
I don't think it's a coincidence that 
people are.

2189
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:31,120
I think fundamentally less happy now,
I think than they have been in a long 

2190
01:40:31,441 --> 01:40:32,910
time.
If you look at the amount of people that

2191
01:40:32,911 --> 01:40:37,911
are on medication for happiness,
it's really what it is and if you're on 

2192
01:40:37,911 --> 01:40:42,591
an antidepressant,
essentially you're on a medication for 

2193
01:40:42,591 --> 01:40:44,310
happiness and whether or not that's 
because of a chemical imbalance that you

2194
01:40:44,311 --> 01:40:49,311
suffer from or because of the fact that 
your job sucks in your life sucks and 

2195
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:49,311
you,
you just,

2196
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:53,691
you're just filled with suck every day 
and you're responding to the well for 

2197
01:40:53,691 --> 01:40:53,860
whatever it is.
If you look at those numbers,

2198
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,380
one or two things is happening.
Probably both.

2199
01:40:56,470 --> 01:41:01,470
One,
we're getting fucked over by these 

2200
01:41:01,470 --> 01:41:02,680
pharmaceutical companies and they get 
unethical doctors to prescribe that shit

2201
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:06,310
with impunity and there's that for sure,
but then there's also like,

2202
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:08,620
people are not connected to this world.
They don't,

2203
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:12,370
they don't feel whole.
They don't feel satisfied in great pain.

2204
01:41:12,371 --> 01:41:15,220
It's better to only be in moderate pain 
or mild pain.

2205
01:41:15,221 --> 01:41:16,720
If you can take a pill.
I mean,

2206
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:18,760
what's hard to do is to get people to 
go,

2207
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:21,260
oh,
well actually that pain is,

2208
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:24,610
is kind of a good sign because it means 
that we all need to kind of work here to

2209
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:26,860
change,
to change the way the world is and,

2210
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:27,640
and,
uh,

2211
01:41:27,641 --> 01:41:30,550
and take some action.
The pain is trying to get you to change.

2212
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:35,780
The paint is trying to get you to avoid 
the pain and you should use your logic 

2213
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:35,780
to say,
well,

2214
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:35,780
what's causing this pain?

2215
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:36,280
But there's a disconnect.
I'm not,

2216
01:41:36,281 --> 01:41:38,440
I'm not,
I'm not emotionally satisfied.

2217
01:41:38,441 --> 01:41:40,240
I'm not connecting with my fellow 
humans.

2218
01:41:40,241 --> 01:41:43,330
I'm missing something unless you're up 
against the wall and there's nothing you

2219
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:47,020
can do to change your circumstances and 
wishing to take the pill.

2220
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:50,350
That's the,
that's the danger there.

2221
01:41:50,351 --> 01:41:53,050
But I do think that more people can 
start to get in touch.

2222
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:54,910
You know,
for me it's these rhythms,

2223
01:41:54,911 --> 01:41:56,140
you know,
the rhythms of life,

2224
01:41:56,170 --> 01:41:58,810
you know,
the 28 day lunar cycle and the fact that

2225
01:41:58,811 --> 01:42:01,810
each week of a lunar cycle,
your neurotransmitters change,

2226
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:07,050
right?
So you have siedel Coleen week followed 

2227
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:07,050
by a serotonin week,
filed by a dopamine.

2228
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:09,400
We followed by a norepinephrine week.
It's like every month is one bump,

2229
01:42:09,410 --> 01:42:10,600
bump bump.
If you know that,

2230
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:11,590
then you're like,
oh,

2231
01:42:11,591 --> 01:42:13,810
this is the dopamine week.
That's why I feel like this.

2232
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:16,670
Or I'm getting strangely.
I mean,

2233
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:19,120
we go to,
there's a website,

2234
01:42:19,121 --> 01:42:21,340
someone space.org
that he's got it,

2235
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,480
he's got it laid out.

2236
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,430
There was originally,
it was an Olympic trainer,

2237
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:26,950
irving Dardick who figured this stuff 
out.

2238
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:27,600
He was,
uh,

2239
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:32,790
doing exercising people at different 
times of the day in different parts of 

2240
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:32,790
the month.
And they,

2241
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:33,010
you know,
they've been looking at bio,

2242
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:36,730
a biological clocks for many years ever 
since the,

2243
01:42:36,731 --> 01:42:37,960
you know,
Major League baseball,

2244
01:42:37,961 --> 01:42:40,150
pretty much discovered jetlag that 
people,

2245
01:42:40,151 --> 01:42:41,770
you know,
get more jet lag when they traveled west

2246
01:42:41,771 --> 01:42:46,771
to east and east to west.
And they realize all these clocks are 

2247
01:42:46,771 --> 01:42:49,321
not folklore.
There's actually something going on 

2248
01:42:49,321 --> 01:42:51,841
here.
So their circadian rhythms for the day 

2249
01:42:51,841 --> 01:42:51,841
and the night.
But there's also all these other rhythms

2250
01:42:51,841 --> 01:42:52,630
controlled by different,
you know,

2251
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:54,220
uh,
you know,

2252
01:42:54,221 --> 01:42:59,221
whether an astronomical features and 
traveling like that really does fuck 

2253
01:42:59,221 --> 01:42:59,320
with those rhythms.
Right?

2254
01:42:59,321 --> 01:43:00,640
Yeah.
Yup.

2255
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:03,050
But as people get in touch with them,
um,

2256
01:43:03,190 --> 01:43:04,770
I think it could help us,
uh,

2257
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:06,550
you know,
get out of some of these,

2258
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:07,550
uh,
you know,

2259
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:10,750
drug,
a drug relationships that we're having,

2260
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:15,751
you know,
wherever you taking drugs in order to 

2261
01:43:15,751 --> 01:43:17,221
compensate for those shifting 
neurotransmitters because we're trying 

2262
01:43:17,221 --> 01:43:18,310
to be on all the time.

2263
01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:23,670
I'm in sales so I got to be in sales 
when I'm in dopamine week or in 

2264
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:23,730
Serotonin week,
you know,

2265
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:25,120
and that's,
that's hard.

2266
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:26,430
Well,
there's also the,

2267
01:43:26,431 --> 01:43:30,820
the arrogance of the human mind to think
that I can manipulate the human mind,

2268
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:32,910
the human mind going like,
oh,

2269
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:37,950
like how things are running here.
I think I am going to take over the 

2270
01:43:37,950 --> 01:43:41,401
running of me and I'm going to invent 
some shit that makes me run more to my 

2271
01:43:41,981 --> 01:43:44,380
liking.
I'd rather just be okay with everything.

2272
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:49,820
Uh,
I want to be high all the time and okay 

2273
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:49,820
with everything,
okay,

2274
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:52,771
can you get that?
And then one day they're going to get 

2275
01:43:52,771 --> 01:43:52,771
what you feel like when you're on 
ecstasy and it's

2276
01:43:52,771 --> 01:43:54,050
going to be,
keep it all day,

2277
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,720
just all day,
enjoying the world.

2278
01:43:56,721 --> 01:43:57,710
Wow.
You've never seen this guy,

2279
01:43:57,711 --> 01:44:02,711
this color blue,
you're going to be so happy to have 

2280
01:44:02,711 --> 01:44:02,711
those though.
They don't like you genuinely have those

2281
01:44:02,711 --> 01:44:06,461
drugs because when,
if you're as high as you are an ecstasy 

2282
01:44:06,461 --> 01:44:08,951
or as high as you are pot,
then you start figuring things out and 

2283
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:09,410
then you start unwinding that 
relationship and becoming less dependent

2284
01:44:09,411 --> 01:44:13,880
on Sam.
It could even just a shift in the levels

2285
01:44:13,881 --> 01:44:16,420
of things and the approach to things 
gives you a,

2286
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:21,460
Oh,
this is a new consciousness space that 

2287
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:23,141
I'm occupying here for.
Whether it's a brief moment or a long 

2288
01:44:23,141 --> 01:44:25,961
drawn out crazy trip and it's different 
than the solar sort of palliative care 

2289
01:44:25,961 --> 01:44:28,400
of.
Of Pharmaceutical.

2290
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:29,450
Sure,
yeah.

2291
01:44:29,451 --> 01:44:29,920
Yeah.
That,

2292
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:34,960
that does the exact opposite is true.
The ones that are available that you 

2293
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,580
could buy on a regular basis are the 
ones that bring you closer to the hive.

2294
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:38,710
Drone.
Exactly.

2295
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:45,220
Yeah.
Just to let you accept more and take 

2296
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:45,860
more.
Even Caffeine and alcohol,

2297
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:50,910
you know,
such easier them to tolerate the one 

2298
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:54,731
that's interesting.
That's sort of playing both sides of 

2299
01:44:54,731 --> 01:44:54,731
that,
of the field here is adderall.

2300
01:44:54,731 --> 01:44:58,870
You know what I mean?
Because they use it to control a little 

2301
01:44:58,870 --> 01:44:58,870
kids,
adderall and Ritalin.

2302
01:44:58,870 --> 01:45:00,110
It's one of these add drugs that keeps 
us kids from,

2303
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,850
you know,
acting out or a different class.

2304
01:45:01,851 --> 01:45:04,430
But also the counterculture is taking it
for a,

2305
01:45:05,230 --> 01:45:05,910
you know,
to write,

2306
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:08,640
to write or work or to get that,
uh,

2307
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:11,960
kind of a right.
I've never fucked with it.

2308
01:45:11,961 --> 01:45:15,860
But the people that I know that I've 
said it kind of hampers creativity.

2309
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:17,540
Right.
I guess.

2310
01:45:17,570 --> 01:45:22,570
I guess it's more for a,
like a speed yet cramming for a test 

2311
01:45:22,570 --> 01:45:22,570
drive.
Yeah.

2312
01:45:22,570 --> 01:45:23,090
Yeah.
Getting work done.

2313
01:45:23,091 --> 01:45:28,091
Organizing Shit.
Like my friend Robert Schimmel rest his 

2314
01:45:28,091 --> 01:45:28,091
soul.

2315
01:45:28,091 --> 01:45:28,091
Uh,
he,

2316
01:45:28,091 --> 01:45:32,711
um,
he accidentally took it once and he had 

2317
01:45:32,711 --> 01:45:33,050
heart issues.
It was kind of a crazy story.

2318
01:45:33,051 --> 01:45:38,051
He picked up the wrong pill,
someone else's prescription and took an 

2319
01:45:38,051 --> 01:45:39,100
adderall.
Then he called his doctor.

2320
01:45:39,101 --> 01:45:40,340
It's like,
what am I in trouble?

2321
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:41,450
I'm scared.
You know,

2322
01:45:41,451 --> 01:45:42,800
I got this heart condition and the guy's
like,

2323
01:45:42,801 --> 01:45:44,420
you're gonna be fine.
You're going to be fine.

2324
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:49,421
You're just gonna you're gonna be,
you're going to be a doing a lot of 

2325
01:45:49,421 --> 01:45:51,700
things over the next few hours and just 
accept that so he takes any said he just

2326
01:45:51,701 --> 01:45:55,290
starts fucking organizing his office and
he sat down in front of his notes and he

2327
01:45:55,291 --> 01:46:00,291
said,
I got more work done than I've ever 

2328
01:46:00,291 --> 01:46:00,291
gotten before.
But.

2329
01:46:00,291 --> 01:46:01,190
Well yeah,
that's why they call it speed,

2330
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:03,560
but it's a,
it's a great.

2331
01:46:03,561 --> 01:46:08,561
Did pay a price.
The ultimate industrial age truck I 

2332
01:46:08,561 --> 01:46:08,561
guess said it makes you more,
more productive,

2333
01:46:08,561 --> 01:46:08,870
more efficient.

2334
01:46:09,290 --> 01:46:10,880
Quite a few friends who've had an issue 
with it.

2335
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:12,410
Several,
you know,

2336
01:46:12,411 --> 01:46:13,670
uh,
a good friend,

2337
01:46:13,671 --> 01:46:17,720
very smart guy who just went,
I'm just got off of it and you know,

2338
01:46:17,730 --> 01:46:22,730
he,
he went crazy with it for like several 

2339
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:24,880
months and he was starting up a business
and working with a tech company and 

2340
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:29,471
there's was a lot of hours and he just 
took a little adderall to help them 

2341
01:46:29,471 --> 01:46:30,350
along the way.
And next thing you know,

2342
01:46:30,351 --> 01:46:31,720
he needed adderall.
Every man.

2343
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:33,710
Yeah.
They do say this to sort of,

2344
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:38,920
I think speed,
longterm speed use is the closest they 

2345
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:42,611
can model schizophrenia with drugs had 
been on speed freak for a really long 

2346
01:46:42,611 --> 01:46:47,261
time.
You get way closer than with any 

2347
01:46:47,261 --> 01:46:47,261
psychedelic or something.
Yeah,

2348
01:46:47,261 --> 01:46:48,350
I taught both.
It just seems like it just red lines.

2349
01:46:48,351 --> 01:46:49,230
Your system.
Yeah.

2350
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:50,030
Lindsay Lohan's

2351
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,350
plead deal.
One string attached.

2352
01:46:52,351 --> 01:46:55,320
I want my adderall.
Was that TMZ?

2353
01:46:55,390 --> 01:47:00,390
Yeah,
she's supposed to be in that prison or 

2354
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:01,900
that Rehab for the next whatever 60 90 
days is.

2355
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,900
She's trying to get a plea deal so she 
can be an adderall and wait a minute.

2356
01:47:04,901 --> 01:47:06,700
They're putting her in jail again.
Yeah.

2357
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:08,620
What for this time?
Uh,

2358
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:13,120
I think it was for hit and run back in 
2010 or something like that.

2359
01:47:13,121 --> 01:47:16,300
I can't remember kid.
I've been following it.

2360
01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:21,510
Well,
there's another weird aspect of our new 

2361
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:22,690
society that children become famous.
You know,

2362
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:25,980
back in the Shirley temple days when 
they invented that.

2363
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:29,320
Yeah.
Who would've ever thought that you would

2364
01:47:29,321 --> 01:47:33,280
get a person like a Lindsay Lohan?
We raised them from the time their child

2365
01:47:33,281 --> 01:47:38,281
and they never know anonymity and just 
long to escape every day long you can 

2366
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:44,300
get fucked up and just drift away in a 
drunken stupor and not have to think 

2367
01:47:44,861 --> 01:47:45,990
about it.
Yup.

2368
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:48,720
And they can't leave it as the thing 
because they're also to,

2369
01:47:48,730 --> 01:47:49,980
to uh,
to add.

2370
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:51,940
Yeah.
And if you do leave it,

2371
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:57,360
it's almost worse to Vin a husband than 
to be a never was.

2372
01:47:57,730 --> 01:47:59,770
It never was.
You see a person walking on the street,

2373
01:47:59,771 --> 01:48:00,390
you never go,
oh,

2374
01:48:00,430 --> 01:48:02,140
look at that loser.
He was never fast.

2375
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:03,360
He just called.
There's a gosh,

2376
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:06,010
I'll tell Ya.
It reminds me there was this moment that

2377
01:48:06,011 --> 01:48:07,750
I still don't know exactly how I feel 
about it.

2378
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:10,750
When they did the,
they did the brady bunch reunion.

2379
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:12,730
It's like 10 years after the show,
whatever,

2380
01:48:12,731 --> 01:48:14,890
20 years.
And Jan didn't show up.

2381
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:18,670
They had a different girl for Jan and I 
was like,

2382
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,550
coconut oil.
In other words,

2383
01:48:21,551 --> 01:48:25,700
she broke free and we'll move on.
She'd probably eat plums.

2384
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:26,450
She probably got,
you know,

2385
01:48:26,470 --> 01:48:28,660
all this crap for not going.
And a lot of people probably thought,

2386
01:48:28,661 --> 01:48:30,220
oh,
because she's probably too screwed up or

2387
01:48:30,221 --> 01:48:31,120
some problem,
whatever.

2388
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:32,080
And I'm like,
no,

2389
01:48:32,081 --> 01:48:33,660
you know,
you went,

2390
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:36,510
you went into the future,
you know,

2391
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:39,700
and we're not going to let that define 
you no matter what.

2392
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:42,300
Yeah.
Or she wanted money and they didn't.

2393
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:44,680
Who knows,
who knows,

2394
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,200
who knows?
Media is good for projecting.

2395
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:52,600
There's something very sad about people 
that live completely in the past.

2396
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:57,660
Like if you were on a show in the 19 
seventies and you're still going to 

2397
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:58,720
those autograph signing things and 
tired.

2398
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:01,060
I heard that it was Barbara Eden on the 
radio,

2399
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:02,640
you know,
Juma Genie.

2400
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:04,120
Yeah.
And I was thinking,

2401
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:05,290
man,
that's one of those.

2402
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:11,440
It's one of those things.
Well Barbara Eden also was in a time 

2403
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:15,331
where you didn't make money like you 
didn't get that residual cash or people 

2404
01:49:15,331 --> 01:49:16,390
are still selling.
I dream of Jeannie.

2405
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:20,140
She would still be getting a palace.
But no,

2406
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:25,360
he didn't.
She didn't get a slice back in those 

2407
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:25,900
Gilligan's island days.
Those guys didn't make any money.

2408
01:49:25,901 --> 01:49:30,370
They got fucked over.
Gilligan's island days was uh,

2409
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:32,070
the,
you know,

2410
01:49:32,071 --> 01:49:35,290
like back in the day,
they never knew about like syndication.

2411
01:49:35,291 --> 01:49:40,291
They didn't,
they didn't have any idea that things 

2412
01:49:40,291 --> 01:49:40,630
are going to be worth so much money and 
then in a digital form forever.

2413
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:45,010
Dude,
I was supposed to be at my next thing by

2414
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:45,790
now.
Whoops.

2415
01:49:46,110 --> 01:49:48,140
It's like five.
How long

2416
01:49:48,330 --> 01:49:50,510
is this?
Pug is a lot of b or do you just go,

2417
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:52,660
just go down to the whole thing?
Yeah.

2418
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:57,690
We never go for more than three hours.
Do you have to leave so that we're 

2419
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:57,690
supposed to go where you going next?
What is it?

2420
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:59,030
What am I doing?
I mean,

2421
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:01,560
I've already missed 13 minutes of it.
Um,

2422
01:50:02,850 --> 01:50:06,490
tennis or at least apologize Jason 
Calacanis.

2423
01:50:06,491 --> 01:50:08,850
He does this conference called launch 
and what does it,

2424
01:50:08,851 --> 01:50:13,851
and it's like Silicon Valley 
entrepreneury what's going to happen 

2425
01:50:13,851 --> 01:50:18,421
next and technology.
So is it like an interview or a podcast 

2426
01:50:18,421 --> 01:50:18,421
and then have another podcast?
No,

2427
01:50:18,421 --> 01:50:21,350
a video podcast or listens to.
Um,

2428

And then Richard Mascara,

2432
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:38,480
He does a dangerous dangerous minds 
website or shouldn't really a great.

2433
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,890
He used to do disinfection.
You invented that whole website.

2434
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:45,520
Oh,

2435
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:46,990

01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:52,600
Alright.

01:52:59,020 --> 01:52:59,020
fuck out of dirty bitches.
All right,

2486
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:01,370
so we'll see you soon.
Oh Indianapolis this weekend.

2487
01:53:01,371 --> 01:53:04,580
Saturday night,
April sixth.

2488
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:06,590
I'll be in Indianapolis with Tony 
Hinchcliffe.

2489
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:11,680
And if you've seen my live at the 
Tabernacle special that's available for 

2490
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:15,350
five bucks on Joe Rogan Dot net right 
now this set is 100 percent new.

2491
01:53:15,410 --> 01:53:18,620
There's nothing from that on,
on any of these shows.

2492
01:53:18,621 --> 01:53:20,510
So to answer all these people's 
questions,

2493
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:23,430
if you shoot you for June bug 
dispersion,

2494
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:28,450
it's all new shit.
I got an hour and 20 minutes now of all 

2495
01:53:28,450 --> 01:53:29,030
new shit and I'm.
And I'm actually happier with it than my

2496
01:53:29,031 --> 01:53:29,960
last special.
So.

2497
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:31,880
So can I think that,
uh,

2498
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:34,120
Kevin Prayer this week,
we're going to have some good podcasts.

2499
01:53:34,121 --> 01:53:37,490
So if you're like freaking out needing a
podcast,

2500
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:39,330
there you go.
Hinge a lot on Thursday.

2501
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:40,190
Oh,
excellence.

2502
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:42,110
Reggie watts tonight.
Excellence.

2503
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:43,010
Yeah,
Penn Jillette.

2504
01:53:43,011 --> 01:53:43,970
Awesome.
That's great.

2505
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,320
You got to do it.
He is he in town?

2506
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:45,820
Uh,
yeah,

2507
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:47,630
I think just he's in town one day or 
something like that.

2508
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:48,290
Wow.
Yeah,

2509
01:53:48,291 --> 01:53:49,970
he's awesome.
He's a great talker too.

2510
01:53:49,971 --> 01:53:54,971
That guy will go on and on and on.
And I think we have cheech and Chong 

2511
01:53:54,971 --> 01:53:54,971
next week.
Oh,

2512
01:53:54,971 --> 01:53:55,300
per and cheech and Chong together.
Yeah.

2513
01:53:55,550 --> 01:53:56,570
Interesting.
All right.

2514
01:53:57,530 --> 01:53:59,000
Douglas Rushkoff.
Ladies and gentlemen.

2515
01:53:59,090 --> 01:54:00,500
Thank you everybody.
We'll see you soon.

2516
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:00,950
Bye.
