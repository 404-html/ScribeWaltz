1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Who did you do to?
To

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,860
another episode of the Richard Jeni Fan
club?

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,580
He's.
He's a guy that I've been telling

4
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:13,020
forever is probably the most underrated
standup in the history of standup.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,290
I think he's one of the all time greats.
Henry's got a body of work because he

6
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,350
did a one hour back before everybody was
doing one hour specials every year.

7
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:21,660
He was doing that shit back in the
nineties.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,160
Oh yeah,
on showtime.

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,710
Like when I was just starting out,
so I think it was like 89 or 90

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,150
somewhere around the one.
He had a showtime special.

11
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:36,200
Yeah.
And then he had a male.

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,490
Yep.
He had a bunch of hbo specials,

13
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:41,760
but the last one that he did before he
died in 2007.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,150
That is his masterpiece.
Yeah.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,330
It's called a steaming pile of me and I
was listening to it one night coming

16
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:53,331
home from a club and just laughing out
loud in the car and clapping,

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,690
clapping,
and I'm like,

18
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,300
God damn.
This guy was good.

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,160
Yeah.
What a good.

20
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,720
I mean he was one of those guys that
dressed.

21
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,990
He put on a sharp outfit,
pleated pants,

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,000
you know,
really fucking Corny,

23
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,650
like nineties looking,
you know,

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,580
call it the collar with the rounded
priest collared shirts.

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,750
Well he was from Bensonhurst.
Oh,

26
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:15,501
is that right?
Yeah,

27
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:19,070
yeah.
It's the old school mentality from

28
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:20,200
Brooklyn.
Yeah.

29
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,010
And he would,
uh,

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,340
he would give you lot.
I can remember like at least three

31
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:28,700
times.
He would call me an hour after my set

32
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,130
and give me taglines to bits.
Wow.

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,440
Yeah.
And they were fucking good.

34
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:35,640
He was almost like on the spectrum with
the.

35
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,040
Yeah,
totally.

36
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:40,610
He wouldn't look you in the eye.
He'd be like looking down and go really

37
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:43,490
fast and talk with his hands.
And uh,

38
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:46,850
and he,
I think he obviously,

39
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:50,780
if people don't know Richard,
Jeni sadly committed suicide in the end.

40
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,470
And what was tough for him was that he
was that good and he never really broke

41
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:58,720
through.
He had a sitcom short lifts Sitcom

42
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,930
called platypus.
Man.

43
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,800
That was on like one of those a upn
eventually.

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,240
And after that it was like he was the
guy who used to fill up his book in

45
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:09,290
January,
you know,

46
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:12,560
he was,
he was on the road 45 weeks a year and

47
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,220
you know,
making 100 grand on corporate dates,

48
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,650
50 grand on corporate dates with,
you know,

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,090
15 of those a year.

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,240
Yeah.
I'm sure he was living well but,

51
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,090
but he felt like a failure.
Yeah.

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,580
And to us he was a hero.
Yeah.

53
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,970
Like I remember seeing him in east side
Comedy Club in New York and um,

54
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,450
it was me and Joey Cola and a couple
other guys.

55
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,390
I only saw one set,
but um,

56
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,860
God,
I forget who the host was,

57
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,300
but the host said he did didn't.
Different hour all four shows.

58
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,040
Shit,
what?

59
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,100
I was so humbled because I was like,
I don't even have.

60
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,800
I had 20 minutes back then it was like,
what,

61
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,590
how did he do that?
How can you do that?

62
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,270
And they were like,
he's the best.

63
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,680
He's a.
But it was a weird thing.

64
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:00,370
It's like

65
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,370
he came along before Netflix because if
he was around today and people got to

66
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,410
see his netflix special.
Yeah.

67
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,250
It's just one of those things that would
have caught on.

68
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,020
Right.
But in the hbo specials,

69
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:13,780
you either home when it aired or you
weren't,

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,570
you know,
there was no dvrs back then.

71
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,790
Maybe maybe set up the vhs tape to
record maybe.

72
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,400
Yeah.
I could never figure out how to fucking

73
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,080
get that thing to record when I wasn't
there.

74
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,380
Oh No.
I could tell them now the time or you,

75
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,290
you'd end up recording like days of our
lives or something and golden girls,

76
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,750
potential twats being written.
There's a bunch of old women in the

77
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,390
scripts are written by old Jewish guys.
Oh,

78
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,790
you know,
I just saw menopause joke.

79
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,970
He said one of the saddest cases to me
because I just don't think that.

80
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,550
I don't know like how many friends he
had,

81
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,590
like in comedy.
I know he's really good friends with

82
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:55,320
Chris Rock and he worked with Chris a
lot.

83
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,080
Like he was like a punch up guy for
Chris a lot,

84
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,580
but I don't,
I don't,

85
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:01,320
you know,
I don't know if anybody was there to

86
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:04,590
just be as.
I think that's a big thing for us

87
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:08,400
because we're so like,
I think comics are some of the weirdest

88
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:09,380
fucking people.
Yeah.

89
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,260
But I gravitate towards them.
Like I've always said if I run into a

90
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:14,760
comic at the airport,
I'm like,

91
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:17,100
oh look,
it's one of us,

92
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,290
you know.
It's just weird.

93
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,680
It's a weird job where weird people were
all crazy.

94
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,330
I've never met one of us that isn't
crazy.

95
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,680
And I think sometimes we need each other
to go.

96
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:29,640
Yeah.
It's all right.

97
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,900
You're right.
Everybody loves you,

98
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:31,350
man.

99
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,960
Like,
yeah,

100
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,590
going to the comedy store for me is
definitely like a therapy session I

101
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:36,850
feel.
And it's partly,

102
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:40,510
it's that you're performing and you're
getting the positive feedback and part

103
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:42,460
of it is that you're running into
people.

104
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:45,550
And I mean it could be anybody,
it could be a,

105
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,890
an Asian female comic,
it could be fat,

106
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,450
can be Don Barris,
like the spectrum of different types.

107
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,130
But like you said,
there's something that,

108
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,530
there's a thread that runs through all
of it,

109
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:01,030
which is like this,
this feeling that like mma,

110
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:02,710
we're going to get in the ring.
We are,

111
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,210
we are going to face an audience at some
point that night and there's a charge to

112
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,620
that.
Like there's a fear.

113
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,130
I don't care who the fuck you are.
You can deny you're afraid when you go

114
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:14,620
on stage every but it's in there
somewhere.

115
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,010
We've just gotten so good at dealing
with it that it doesn't show and

116
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,390
sometimes we're not even aware of it.

117
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,000
And if it's not there,
that means you're probably not taking

118
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:23,230
any chances.
Right.

119
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,990
That's not good.
Then you'll have that doll thing going

120
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:29,080
on stage and then you'll bomb.
And then you'll really have fear when

121
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:32,140
you're doing jokes that you think are
killer and they've just eaten plates a

122
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:34,840
ship up there because you don't have
anything left in you.

123
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,460
Yeah.
Like last night,

124
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:41,260
it's just murderer's row man.
I'm walking in and fucking Bobby Lee's

125
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,790
crushing and then Chris Delea is
crushing and then I go up and Thiel,

126
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,360
vons crushing,
and then it's fucking Ian Edwards smash.

127
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,170
And that's like,
yeah,

128
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,950
good Lord with a lineup and you're
hugging everybody.

129
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:57,650
I'm hugging barris.
I see him a hug Whitney Cummings.

130
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:58,010
I see how

131
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,890
everybody's just like.
It's just this big comradery place.

132
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,290
Yeah.
We're so lucky

133
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,450
here.
We survived.

134
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,070
You know,
and there's so many guys that I came up,

135
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,830
you know,
we came up with guys that I would have.

136
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,540
I was competitive when I started out and
these guys I had bad blood with and I

137
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,350
see this guys now and they're like my
brothers because we went through it

138
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:19,050
together.

139
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,240
Yeah,
I know the competitive thing.

140
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:23,370
I've talked about that.
Like I had to give that up.

141
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,760
I had that when I was a kid when I was
21 ish because it was still leftover

142
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:31,770
from the martial arts days,
martial arts competition.

143
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,300
Then like I would want people to do bad
and then I realized that God is so

144
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:39,510
stupid,
like that has zero effect on me.

145
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,750
Like when they're up there,
if they're doing good,

146
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,240
that'll just make me better.
It would just make me work harder.

147
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,830
Yeah.
But if they do bad,

148
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,650
like I was like that's the thing that
some comedians do.

149
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:52,560
They will take a terrible comment on the
road with them so they can look like a

150
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:54,960
hero.
It's a common thing,

151
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,550
right?
It's called stacking the deck.

152
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,870
Look,
they'll stack the deck.

153
00:06:57,871 --> 00:07:01,410
They'll have like just some torturous
act for half an hour and then they go up

154
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,880
and look like a monster.
Yeah.

155
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,060
And that's not the way to do it,
I don't think.

156
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,970
I think the way to do is the opposite.
Just have a bunch of murderers on in

157
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,720
front of you and have fun with it.
Yeah.

158
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,940
And everybody have fun.
Yeah.

159
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,980
I think that you.

160
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,380
I love,
I mean there's,

161
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,520
I don't like going on you layer.
There's like one or two guys that I just

162
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:25,660
don't like going on after and,
and,

163
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,380
but in general,
why don't you like going on after

164
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,020
deleted?
I just feel like he's so physical and

165
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,280
big and that doesn't really.
It shouldn't affect me,

166
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,930
but I just feel like when he gets off
the crowd is just like in this mode of

167
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:44,950
like euphoria and it's Kinda like,
all right,

168
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:46,990
I'm going to,
I'm going to take it down a couple

169
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:51,430
notches and just talk.
And I feel like sometimes that's my

170
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:53,650
weakness that I can adjust to that.
Joey Diaz,

171
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:54,484
same thing.
Oh,

172
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:59,590
it's just like the room is just,
they got to put their socks back on and

173
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:02,650
you're up there and I,
and I'm writing dry shit.

174
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:05,680
I'm trying to be a little ironic and
they're just looking at me like,

175
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,790
you're small,
you're insignificant.

176
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:10,301
You're,
you know,

177
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:13,120
in all your insecurity.
Start coming out sometimes.

178
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,320
And I've beaten that like you,
you come up in New York and you can't be

179
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:20,710
like that because you go on after a
towel and Louis and whoever.

180
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:24,880
And so I came to terms with,
with trying to realizing that you don't

181
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:28,030
ride the wave,
you let the wave settle and you start

182
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:29,710
your own way.
And,

183
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,490
and I would make that mistake early on
is I'd come up then and I jack up my

184
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:35,890
energy and I,
and it wasn't me and then it would

185
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:36,680
falter.

186
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,940
Yeah,
that is,

187
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,490
that is true.
You have to bring the audience to you.

188
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

189
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:45,980
And of the best place to learn how to do
that as the Olr right now because first

190
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:46,731
of all,
you really,

191
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:50,810
you only have 15 minutes and there's all
these other guys that have 15 minutes to

192
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:54,290
and they go on these rides.
So everybody's going on a new ride,

193
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,050
like,
okay,

194
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,040
just got done with magic

195
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,250
mountain or space mountain.
Now we're going to go on this ride.

196
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:00,480
And it's a small world.
Oh,

197
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:01,470
small world.
Slower.

198
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,840
He settled down.
It's not as crazy.

199
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:06,060
We're all the lights.
You got to settle in.

200
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

201
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,900
It's a great fucking place for just just
figuring it out and working on your

202
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,610
shit.
I'm in this weird place right now with

203
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:17,940
my act where I'm getting ready to film a
special.

204
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,450
I'm hyper examining.
Yeah,

205
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,300
everything going over everything with a
fine tooth comb.

206
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:28,080
But the problem with that is you go over
everything too much and then it starts

207
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,960
getting real blurry looking at what is
this?

208
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,330
Yeah.
And you start landing.

209
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,360
I find that I start landing on the
punchlines too hard instead of talking

210
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:42,180
it out instead of like being like the
more ideal at the more.

211
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,240
I know,
all right,

212
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,760
this is where they laugh and I sort of.

213
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,270
And there's sort of lucky I stick it too
much instead of flowing.

214
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,060
And so when,
when you do the special,

215
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:54,540
it's almost like you got to take,
take a little time off before you do it.

216
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,040
There's a number of sets you do where
you're,

217
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,830
you're in the groove and it's tight and
everything feels good.

218
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:05,580
And then there's a number that you do
too much and everything gets kind of

219
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:06,420
flat.
Yeah.

220
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
You've got to find that right.
What is that?

221
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,350
No one,
if they have that,

222
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:12,150
another thing.
So like if that's a must be the case

223
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:16,440
with bands right when they toured,
they must get so sick of fucking singing

224
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,510
the same song over and over and over and
over again.

225
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,600
I mean,
I saw the beach boys recently and uh,

226
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,270
they fucking love it.
They love being up there,

227
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,610
you know,
you can see it,

228
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,970
you can feel it,
you know,

229
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:28,260
I think it goes to another level.

230
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,780
I think it becomes a communication with
the fans,

231
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,750
with bands that we don't necessarily
have the same thing.

232
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,590
It's like for them areas,
a very communal experience that's

233
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:39,780
happening.
And with us it's more like,

234
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,480
we're going to dominate you for an hour.
Right?

235
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,220
We're going to take control of this
room.

236
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,170
You're going to listen to everything we
say.

237
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,970
We're going to bring you up,
take you down.

238
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:50,130
It's salt,
you bring you back in.

239
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,830
You know,
crowd worked is like a whole thing,

240
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:55,370
but it's all being orchestrated by you.
Yeah.

241
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,910
Yeah.
Another thing we were talking about

242
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,130
about traveling to places like the
further you go,

243
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,440
the harder it is to get there,
the more happy they are.

244
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,930
Right?
That's a,

245
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:09,260
that's an interesting phenomenon.
Like if you could do,

246
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,270
like I was saying that Ari and I did a
Gig in Anchorage,

247
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,880
Alaska a few years back.
Fucking amazing.

248
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,670
Yeah.
Get up there and this weird town,

249
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,950
you know,
and the coolest fucking people.

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,140
There've been anchorage now,
Dude.

251
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,790
Crazy.
We've got up there and uh,

252
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,900
I'm expecting,
I'm going to see people covering for and

253
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:31,710
everything's going to be covered in snow
and the rod dog sleds everywhere and

254
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,550
shit that they were so normal,
uh,

255
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,880
drove by this group of people holding up
signs.

256
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,130
Said Honk for diversity.
Have Nosha like they're holding rainbow

257
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:43,620
flags up and shit.
Do they have diversity?

258
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,600
Yeah.
No Shit.

259
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

260
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:47,550
It's,
I mean,

261
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,050
it's a real city.
I mean,

262
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,190
it's small.
Yeah.

263
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,870
How many people you think live in
Anchorage?

264
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,590
If you had to?
20,000.

265
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,090
I'm going to go with 50,
50 people.

266
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,601
Yeah.
No,

267
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,010
50,000.
300,000.

268
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,510
300,000.
No Shit.

269
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,680
Wow.
Shit.

270
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,600
That's huge.
Yeah.

271
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,620
That's three times the size of boulder.
That's really big houses in Juneau.

272
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,370
I remember I was in Juno and there was a
burger king and I was like,

273
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:18,160
what the fuck is a burger king doing in
the middle of Alaska?

274
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,890
And then they were bald eagles going
through the dumpster and picking a

275
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:26,891
fucking big MACs
is a symbol of America right here.

276
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,410
That's the first time I've ever seen
that.

277
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:31,900
You go live.
Was it Alaska?

278
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,890
There's a weird animal look at.
I know it's a weird animal to pick for

279
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:38,950
your bird to like start national animal.
Yeah.

280
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,340
Ruthless fucking evil raptor.
Yeah.

281
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,910
That comes out of the sky at a nowhere
kills.

282
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,210
Oh yeah.
You know,

283
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:53,140
they say that there was an eagle at one
point in time that they think was

284
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:54,520
preying on early humans.

285
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,200
No Shit.
No.

286
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,100
They think that there's been some giant
raptors in the past and they found some

287
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:04,660
old primate bones,
some old ancient ancestors of human

288
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:08,440
beings that had what looked like claw
marks on their skulls.

289
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,500
Their brains had been picked out of
their skull and caught out.

290
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,040
Yeah.
There was an eagle like that and it's

291
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,920
New Zealand was called the Haast Eagle
was an enormous ego in New Zealand,

292
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,250
like way bigger than any of the eagles
that we have alive today.

293
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,410
I think it might have jack to few
people.

294
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,880
Wow.
Well,

295
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:27,070
Colorado,
I'm sure when you lived out there people

296
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:29,170
you can't leave your dog outside.
No,

297
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,300
my dog had eaten there now.
No Shit.

298
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,890
Yeah,
I had a bit about it in my act.

299
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,620
No Shit.
My little dog.

300
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,200
What kind of dog was it?
He was,

301
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,520
um,
a Pomeranian American eskimo mix.

302
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,250
That's a decent sized dog that he was
real little.

303
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,330
He was like this big.
It was like maybe 30 pounds.

304
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,470
Tiny little guy.
Yeah,

305
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,260
he got Jack.
Did you see him get ya know?

306
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,710
But we saw the cat hanging around the
property.

307
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,620
We saw the cat in the area and then
there was,

308
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:02,050
there was definitely evidence that
something had gone down.

309
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,880
Yeah,
no,

310
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,640
fuck yeah,
it happens all the time.

311
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,080
One of the things that they found in
California is because California has a

312
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:13,210
lot of mountain lions that live on the
outskirts of cities.

313
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,710
They purposely hanging around the
outskirts of cities and come into town

314
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:22,000
at night and eat people's dogs and cats
and they found that when they examined

315
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:25,180
the contents,
they expected it to be way more like

316
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:29,860
rabbits and deer and shit like that.
But it was half domestic house cats and

317
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:30,790
dogs.
Yeah.

318
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,870
Half of their diet because they're easy.
The fatted calf.

319
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,330
Well also they can just jump over
everything.

320
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,350
I mean,
any fence,

321
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:41,710
you have that group over it,
grab your dog and they're so powerful

322
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,810
they can take your dog over the top of
the fence.

323
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,340
Right?
Fucking nuts.

324
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,680
Shit.
No.

325
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,200
I came home one day and there was a
possum in the driveway.

326
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,530
And the Cro,
you know,

327
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,490
fucking.

328
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,710
Are they ravens?
Are Crows in la?

329
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,990
Those giant black birds.
That's a good question.

330
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,180
I don't know what the differences,
because I said they were crows and my

331
00:14:59,181 --> 00:14:59,661
friend's like,
no,

332
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:02,630
those are ravens and they're,
they're big.

333
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:07,520
I mean there are good two feet long and
it was on top of a possum and it was

334
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,220
fucking picking it apart.
And the thing was alive.

335
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:12,470
The possum was alive.
Yeah.

336
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,700
Really?
And so I,

337
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:15,380
uh,
so I tried to scare this,

338
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:19,290
this a blackbird away and he looked at
me like I'm not going anywhere.

339
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:23,240
I got to fucking possum here.
And so I got a broom and I like pushed

340
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:25,130
him away.
He took off.

341
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,850
Yeah,
he let you get that close.

342
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,651
You could touch.
Oh yeah,

343
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,480
he wasn't leaving the possum.
Whoa.

344
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,290
And then he,
uh,

345
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:35,000
he stood like 12 feet away and I got a
shoe box and I put the PA submitted.

346
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,800
But the possums,
they hiss at you,

347
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,120
they open their mouths,
they just go like this and they got

348
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:43,100
vicious teeth.
You've got to be really careful with

349
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:44,810
them.
But I got it in the shoe box and I

350
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,000
called animal services and they came and
got it.

351
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,070
We'll get you out there saving.
That's right.

352
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,560
I love possums.
Do you think for them?

353
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah,
they're cute as shit.

354
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,210
I love him and they just so mysterious.
You know,

355
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:58,400
they come out at night and like where
are they hiding them?

356
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:02,510
The day one of them used to sleep and I
had some shrubs on the side of my lawn

357
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:03,890
and it was,
you could,

358
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,260
if you looked inside,
you could see him hanging upside down.

359
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,611
Yeah.
Oh,

360
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:08,750
that's right.
They hang.

361
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,580
Yeah.
What a fucked up animal I now,

362
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,570
have you ever seen a quad a Monday?
Never even heard of it.

363
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,380
A quad a Monday is a an animal that's in
South America and a friend of mine was

364
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:23,330
telling me he ran into one or I was
listening to his podcast.

365
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:28,040
Rather he ran into one of them in
Arizona and that it looks like a bear

366
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,830
fucked a monkey and it looks like half
bear,

367
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:31,940
half mcgee.
Leave that thing.

368
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,320
No Shit.
Cool thing and it's a climber,

369
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,333
dad,
dude.

370
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,510
Well they're big.
They're like 40 pounds and they're

371
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:46,511
predatory and he was making noises.
He was deer hunting and this thing came

372
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:52,350
running out of the woods.
He was trying to call it by making like

373
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:53,550
a wounded animal.
Sounds like

374
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,970
this thing.
I can't run it out of the out of the

375
00:16:58,971 --> 00:17:01,130
grass looking at him.
Look at that thing.

376
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,820
We just fucking crazy little animal go
wolverine.

377
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,090
I didn't even know that existed.
I had no idea that thing existed.

378
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,380
I mean it does look like it's a member
of the Badger family and look at its

379
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:14,690
face,
but then it has a tail,

380
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,790
like a big crazy long tail

381
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,790
teeth look like a,
like a rang of tank teeth.

382
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,610
The way they curve in like sharp,

383
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,180
I didn't even know that was a real
thing.

384
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,330
Apparently it's,
there's a lot of them in South America

385
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,540
and then in the United States they are
expanding their range in Arizona.

386
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,900
Wow.
Yeah.

387
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,550
The way you spell it is c o a t I m u n
d I,

388
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,520
quantum Monday.
Isn't that a Spanish speaking channel?

389
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,650
It was actually coming up like that.
Kuda Monday.

390
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,023
Oh,
interesting.

391
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,810
Yeah.
But people spell it with a C in America.

392
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,070
Yeah.

393
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,720
I went with the phonetic spelling,
that type of thing actually with Acu.

394
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,430
And this is what came up was the key.
Interesting.

395
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,730
A,
um,

396
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:58,280
I think what,
uh,

397
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,970
what,
how is it spelled in another one if you

398
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:01,650
scrolled down that one we just looked at
it.

399
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,200
I think you spelled with a c.
yeah,

400
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:06,180
I think that's how you spell it.
Cla.

401
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,100
Yeah,
whatever.

402
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,970
It's awesome.
And people apparently the game and fish

403
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:15,330
department in Arizona,
they get calls all the time where people

404
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:17,640
like there's a monkey running around in
the woods.

405
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,650
I saw a monkey,
but it's that thing that,

406
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,440
that could just be a racist.
Call it Arizona is this weird place.

407
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,630
Arizona is a incredibly interesting and
its climate,

408
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:34,050
right?
Like you've got desert and then you have

409
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:38,460
like some of the craziest forest.
You have all kinds of weird shit.

410
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:39,294
They're like,
oh,

411
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,330
incredibly diverse wildlife population
in Arizona.

412
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,163
Yeah,
right.

413
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,670
They gas birds,
birds and deer and elk and all kinds of

414
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:48,900
weird shit.
Crazy.

415
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,770
Like you're in the middle of Phoenix and
you got this fucking giant cliffs

416
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,690
sticking right up in the middle of the
city.

417
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,910
Great hiking.
I did that one time there.

418
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,070
They have an influx of Jaguars now.
Oh,

419
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,520
there's a quantum Monday wars.
Yes.

420
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,740
They're moving in from Mexico.
Look at that fucker.

421
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,780
Things says they make good pets too,
apparently.

422
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,840
Really as you can train them.
Whoa.

423
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,970
Hold those fucking teeth.
At first.

424
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:18,060
I'm pretty sure we saw one of those in
Costa Rica and my daughters were calling

425
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:20,220
it a Kinkajou.
They made up a name for it,

426
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,200
but he was just hanging out near this
resort in Costa Rico.

427
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,200
Yeah.
Look,

428
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,120
it is a little fuckers just chilling.
They got long tongues,

429
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,950
so are there any editors too?
I bet.

430
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,570
I bet they fucking eat everything.

431
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,090
Yeah,
I mean it's hard out there.

432
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,000
Look at him.
Just know.

433
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,920
Oh my God.
The guy's patting it.

434
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,380
That is crazy.
These are wild.

435
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:43,861
Oh,
okay.

436
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:45,070
That's a resort.
See,

437
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:47,940
that's Kinda like what I experienced in
Costa Rica.

438
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,030
These things would just combine.
Hang out.

439
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,300
What a cool looking fucking animal that
guys belly did not yet as in front of A.

440
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,440
Yeah.
South America.

441
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,980
It's,
it's crazy how like if you've gone to

442
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:06,880
south,
have you ever gone to South America now?

443
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,010
Oh yeah.
Chili,

444
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,530
the wildlife there.
It's just incredible.

445
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,230
Costa Rica has all these different kinds
of Costa Rica.

446
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,380
They have howler monkeys.
Right?

447
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,640
Those other small.
Yeah.

448
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,900
We had a howler monkeys.
Right?

449
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,640
It was like a one because it's the rain
forest and we had a one mile like path

450
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,090
that went around the house that we're
renting and yet these howler monkeys

451
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:29,580
would go right above.
You scream.

452
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:32,580
No fear.
It was fucking dogs everywhere.

453
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:35,460
We had like two dogs that just work.
They must have come with the house.

454
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:38,940
They were just there and you feed them
and they follow you everywhere.

455
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,310
Oh Wow.
And then you drive up and there's a,

456
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,190
the black river,
I think it's called and it's right on

457
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:48,040
the border of Nicaragua and uh,
they've

458
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,120
got those Caymans,
you know,

459
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:53,500
this little alligators and you take a
boat through these like waterways and I

460
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:57,760
mean it is filthy with came and they're
fucking everywhere.

461
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,780
Wow.
It was so scary.

462
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:01,300
And we were,
we were just like

463
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,420
paddle.
And through them they have real

464
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:07,440
crocodiles in Costa Rica,
they have those big ass crocodiles.

465
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,340
We would do that.
Yeah.

466
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:11,880
We went on a tour and they take on a
boat and they take you like pretty close

467
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:13,710
to these things.
But I'm freaking the fuck out.

468
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,330
I'm like,
one of my kids falls overboard.

469
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:16,170
They're dead.
Right.

470
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:18,730
And you're just on this little boat,
you know?

471
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,210
And these,
these people are so relaxed about like

472
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:25,860
safety and she isn't so not Disneyland.
You Go.

473
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,920
Did you go to the middle part?
Like Lake rnl with went to a couple of

474
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,280
different spots,
but we went up to the rain forest and

475
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:35,460
did the zip line,
which is a mile long.

476
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,900
And I'm like,
Ooh,

477
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,900
fuck is checking this.
Who's making sure that this is the

478
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:41,570
stability of this line is intact.

479
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,830
All right?
And then they had this,

480
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,190
they have this volcano that's in,
um,

481
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,880
I forget they will.
Lake Lake area is the area and they've

482
00:21:49,881 --> 00:21:50,714
got these,
uh,

483
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:56,170
this hot springs and there was like 14
pools that went up a hill and you could,

484
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,130
you could swim in each one.
And the bottom was like cold and the top

485
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:04,730
one was so hot,
it was practically boiling so you could

486
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:06,980
just kind of work your way up into each
one.

487
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,270
And then,
uh,

488
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,193
and then these,
uh,

489
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,780
you know,
this woman comes up to me and she goes,

490
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,310
you want a massage?
And I was like,

491
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:16,070
yeah.
So we go out to this little,

492
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:19,010
like a,
it's off to the side and there's like a

493
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:22,970
little their sheets around a bed and I'm
laying there and I'm like,

494
00:22:22,971 --> 00:22:24,710
this is fucking great,
you know.

495
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,020
And then all of a sudden I hear my
mother's voice and she had gotten

496
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:32,960
solicit and she was getting a massage
like six inches from me.

497
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,860
And I'm stark naked getting rubbed by
this beautiful Costa Rican woman.

498
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,150
And I could hear my mother who doesn't
stop talking for the entire.

499
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,800
They're thick bronx accent.
So how long you been here for you from

500
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:51,360
here?
That's a relaxation crusher.

501
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,150
Yes.
We just want to just melt into the rain

502
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:59,151
forest and rubbed on down through that
little horseshoe with your face in it

503
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:01,230
and look at those little Costa Rican
feet.

504
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:08,680
Brown rounded little toes.
Oh,

505
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,480
that's so weird.
Massages are fucking weird,

506
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:13,314
man.
Yeah,

507
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,050
it's weird.
I mean it's obviously there's,

508
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,890
there's a physical aspect to it,
like you want your muscles to be

509
00:23:19,891 --> 00:23:24,340
manipulated because it's very good for
them and you get loose some kinks in a

510
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:26,670
lot of like weird stuff that's not
adopt.

511
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,140
But there's also the pleasure aspect of
it's pleasurable,

512
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,060
right?
Like it feels good to have someone touch

513
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:33,894
you.

514
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh my God.
I mean your skin is your biggest organ.

515
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:41,860
And they talk about emotionally and
psychically what it means to have skin

516
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:45,500
to skin contact.
And for an hour somebody is devoting

517
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:47,330
their skin to your skin.
I mean,

518
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,630
think about you have sex with your wife.
You're touching for,

519
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,680
you know,
15,

520
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:55,610
20 minutes.
One part of you little groping you cry,

521
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:00,970
but to have a sensual touch like that
know for an hour.

522
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,640
Yeah,
and also like the energy that you must

523
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,090
get.
Like when you're a person who's doing

524
00:24:09,091 --> 00:24:11,550
that all day,
like you're putting out a lot of energy,

525
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,690
you're getting energy from those people.
Like some people must feel weird.

526
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,103
Yeah,
I've talked.

527
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,850
I've talked to who say that they have to
discharge energy after a massage.

528
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,830
They do in.
These are more like touchy feely kind of

529
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,130
misuses.
Quinsy told people.

530
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,993
Yeah,
yeah,

531
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,380
yeah.
That one that she,

532
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,510
she would put crystals in my belly
button.

533
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,730
Oh.
And then my arm would be down and she

534
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:38,731
would hold my arm and tell me to raise
my arm to see what the pressure was and

535
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:43,210
then she could tell by that which herbal
remedies I needed for my allergies,

536
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,850
Jesus Christ,
to so many of these people out so

537
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,250
fucking crazy.

538
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,440
And then it works.
And you're like,

539
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,790
what the fuck it worked.
I guess you can believe anything.

540
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,020
How did it work?
I,

541
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,840
she gave me allergies.
So these herbs,

542
00:25:01,841 --> 00:25:05,650
because I was like,
just fucking sneezing nonstop and I stop

543
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:08,520
sneezing and you know what that,
that,

544
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:10,890
um,
that would he homeopath,

545
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,000
they take like a barrel of distilled
water and then they'll put in like a

546
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:21,001
mint leaf and like a couple other herbs
and then they just take the bottle and

547
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:25,240
they fill it with that water and that's,
that's homeopathic remedy.

548
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:28,360
Most of them are like that.
Did that diluted?

549
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,900
Yeah.
A lot of it's bullshit.

550
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:32,270
Like I remember somebody gave me Arnica
once.

551
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,390
What's that?
It's like some little little pills.

552
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,070
They're little tiny,
tiny little,

553
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,180
almost little little things that
dissolve in your mouth.

554
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,010
Oh yeah,
right.

555
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,190
It's like sugar,
right?

556
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,450
I go,
this is sugar.

557
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,441
And someone's like,
Nah,

558
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:46,580
the sugar in it.
I go,

559
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:47,630
well,
why is there sugar in it?

560
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:50,300
It's supposed to be medicine.
Sugar's not good for you.

561
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:54,140
What the fuck is this?
And it was homeopathic or some sort of

562
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:55,280
homeopathic remedy.
I'm like,

563
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:57,350
okay,
do I have to believe this stuff works

564
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:58,730
for it to work?
Because one of those things,

565
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,170
because that's a real thing,
right?

566
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,280
You know?
Well,

567
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:04,970
what do you say to people who don't
think that vitamins are helpful?

568
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,133
Well,
that's silly.

569
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,320
There's a lot of studies that show the
vitamins are healthy.

570
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,800
What does a lot of studies that say
they're not?

571
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,630
Yeah,
not really.

572
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,110
I mean too much.
Vitamins was excessive.

573
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:19,880
Vitamins doesn't make any sense,
but the studies that show that vitamins

574
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:22,340
are beneficial.
They're pretty specific.

575
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,730
There's pretty specific in terms of like
if you get your blood work done,

576
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,630
right.
For instance,

577
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:31,760
and you are short a lot of people short
of vitamin D dot vitamin D is a big one.

578
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:34,490
Vitamin B is also a big one.
Bb Twelve,

579
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,390
which is the one you get from the sun,
that's d two.

580
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,530
D three is a good one too and that one's
good for muscle development and a lot of

581
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:45,600
other functions.
There's a lot of shit that vitamins are

582
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:48,180
good for.
Fish oil is fantastic.

583
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,850
It's very good for reducing
inflammation.

584
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,810
There's a lot of supplements that are
100 percent legit,

585
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,160
but there's a lot of doctors that don't
know anything about nutrition and it'll

586
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:00,670
tell you all you need is a balanced
meal,

587
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,293
a balanced meal.

588
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,140
Well,
if you had a balanced meal,

589
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,190
kind of,
yeah,

590
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,580
if you really made sure that you ate a
certain portion of vegetables,

591
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:11,310
green leafy dark vegetables that have a
lot of vitamins,

592
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:15,030
and if you made sure that you have the
right amount of protein and fruit.

593
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:15,931
Yeah,
fruit,

594
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:16,980
some,
some fruit.

595
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,380
You're not a proponent of eating too
much fruit or identity.

596
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,860
Tell me like a sugar in it.
Like juices.

597
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,880
Most juices are too high in sugar.
If you drink a big glass of orange

598
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:29,190
juice,
your body has a really hard time

599
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:34,191
differentiating that between a big glass
of soda or fucking high c or some shit

600
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:37,560
like that.
It's like if it has 30 grams of sugar,

601
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:39,540
it has 30 grams of sugar and that's what
it is.

602
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:42,210
It's 30 grams of sugar.
The fact that it's coming out of an

603
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:43,140
orange,
that's great,

604
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:45,840
but you're not supposed to drink it like
that and the orange is supposed to be

605
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:47,790
something you eat when you eat it.

606
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,610
You get all the fiber,
your body breaks it down slower.

607
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,480
You're just getting this fucking
mainline a sugar right into your system.

608
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,380
I drink a glass or like if I go and I
have breakfast with a big glass of

609
00:27:58,381 --> 00:27:59,970
orange juice,
I fucking crashed.

610
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,530
Hard like an hour later.
Yeah,

611
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,840
it's a little insulin dump.
Well,

612
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:06,330
they just did it.
I just read yesterday that there's this

613
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:11,220
study now that losing weight is not
about caloric intake.

614
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,560
It's all about sugar and processed
foods.

615
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,790
Crazy.
Yeah.

616
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,560
No.
Could they say the amounts don't matter?

617
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,690
You can.
You can eat way more than you think you

618
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:20,370
can.
As long as you're reading the right

619
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:22,590
shit.
Will weightwatchers have completely

620
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:26,940
changed the way they recommend food,
like eggs or zero points.

621
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:28,550
Now,
Joey,

622
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,990
Joey Diaz and Brian Redmond.
Brian red beds onto.

623
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,990
He was telling me that eggs are zero
point zero.

624
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,330
You can eat as many eggs as you want.
You can eat five eggs.

625
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,770
Yeah.
People used to say,

626
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:40,290
well,
eggs have cholesterol and hello.

627
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,140
This is terrible for you for fats and
all this.

628
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,050
Nope.
Nope.

629
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,570
Fucking great for you.
Sorry.

630
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:50,010
We will live forever.
I was fucking reading to my kids a

631
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:52,620
little while back.
We had a Dr Seuss book and it had the

632
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:55,710
food pyramid and I go,
this food prayer was bullshit.

633
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,580
Like,
what is this?

634
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,160
It's all fucking.
The bottom of it is all cereal.

635
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,050
Yeah.
It's all like cereal and bread.

636
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,930
That's like the most important thing.
What are you to have the zero point

637
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:04,950
foods on the.
Never list.

638
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,980
Boneless skinless chicken breast,
boneless,

639
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:10,860
skinless Turkey breast ground,
lean chicken ground,

640
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:13,410
lean Turkey,
thin sliced deli chicken,

641
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:16,260
bro.
So it's all fish and shellfish.

642
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:19,740
Wow.
Does not include smoked or dried fish?

643
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,870
Huh?
Why wouldn't include smoked fish?

644
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,100
That seems weird.
Can fish this packed in water or brined?

645
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,110
I eat canned tuna to food or smoke to
this.

646
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,620
We're all like zero.
Nonfat Plain Regular and Greek yogurt.

647
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:37,950
Nonfat ain't good for you.
Nonfat anything is nonsense.

648
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,980
Eggs,
plain soy yogurt,

649
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,620
milk,
fresh frozen and canned beans and

650
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:46,960
lentils that are packed without oil or
sugar.

651
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,300
Yeah.
Beans and lentils are huge.

652
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,920
Yeah.
If you could just eat all that stuff on.

653
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,990
Mikado is not on there.
I guess it's got some fat in it.

654
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,460
Well,
it's got healthy fats,

655
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,080
right?
Avocados.

656
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,800
Unusual because it has mostly
unsaturated fats,

657
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:01,630
but it has saturated fats too.
Yeah,

658
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,590
it's really good for you.
Avocado is a fucking wonderful food.

659
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,440
Wonderful.

660
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,440
I'm 155 pounds,
but I had a fucking belly just because,

661
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:12,870
uh,
you know,

662
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,680
I was writing on crashing last year and
they would have,

663
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,700
we'd have like five meals a day,
muffins being handed out and I put on

664
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:24,701
six pounds and it always in my belly
breads and process shit.

665
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:28,070
And so January first I cut out all
bread,

666
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:29,450
all pasta,
all sugar,

667
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,600
and I've been working out like five days
a week and the belly just fucking

668
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,880
disappear.
You seem like you've got some pep in

669
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:35,990
your step.
A little bit,

670
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,250
little bit,
little bit extra Ritalin also helps.

671
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,430
Does it a lot of coffee.
Do you ever get your hormones checked?

672
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,420
No.
No.

673
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,600
You probably should see if the
testosterone levels there.

674
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,200
Yeah.

675
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,540
You know,
that's a major factor in depression.

676
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,250
No Shit.
Major factor.

677
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,970
A major factor in people with head
injuries.

678
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,600
Yeah.
People that have come back from war that

679
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:00,434
have been,
um,

680
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,180
you know,
like a lot of ied has been around,

681
00:31:02,181 --> 00:31:06,140
a lot of explosions been jolted,
a lot of football players,

682
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,160
of course,
boxers,

683
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:09,920
MMA fighters,
they lose testosterone as they get

684
00:31:09,921 --> 00:31:12,050
older,
get pituitary damage.

685
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,250
Your pituitary gland apparently is
incredibly sensitive and some people get

686
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:19,050
it that are jet skiers or into jet
skiing because just the

687
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:24,270
right all that bouncing and head banging
his head banging his fucking terrible

688
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:26,520
for you.
Play soccer and he heads these,

689
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,650
the goal,
you'll kick the ball all the way down

690
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:30,330
the field and I'll see him headed.
I'll be like,

691
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,360
dude,
just let it fucking bounce.

692
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:34,500
Yeah,
yeah.

693
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,670
That's heavy impacts.
It is in a soccer players get it a lot.

694
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,150
He got a concussion from heading against
another guy wants.

695
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,540
He was out for three weeks.
They collided heads.

696
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,160
Yeah.
Oh God,

697
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,270
yeah.
Your fucking head.

698
00:31:50,271 --> 00:31:51,980
It's so hard.
It's like running into another,

699
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,380
like a rock,
like a bone.

700
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,180
Yeah.
Someone could beat you to death with a

701
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:56,940
head

702
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,710
and you're whipping your head.
You're whipping your head at the ball.

703
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,740
So like both slamming into each other.
Oh yeah.

704
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,980
I played hockey my whole life though and
never had any major involvement.

705
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,170
My neck,
I chipped a vertebrae in my neck.

706
00:32:10,171 --> 00:32:11,910
That was the only thing that happened.
You do that?

707
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,910
My,
I was small but I was a good skater

708
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:18,360
because I grew up near a lake.
So we just skated back before global

709
00:32:18,361 --> 00:32:21,070
warming.
That lake froze at Christmas and it went

710
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,270
till March.
We were out there every fucking day.

711
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:25,710
Afterschool,
all weekend.

712
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:28,950
All we did was play ice hockey.
So when I got to high school,

713
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,270
um,
I was,

714
00:32:30,271 --> 00:32:32,310
I was the only kid who could really
skate backwards.

715
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:34,050
Well.
So the coach was like,

716
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:35,400
you're on defense.
I'm like,

717
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,680
I'm a hundred and 15 pounds.
So he taught me how to check of usually

718
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:40,040
check with

719
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,120
your shoulder,
your hip.

720
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,510
He taught me how to check guys under the
Chin with the top of my head,

721
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,120
which I,
which I got good at.

722
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,330
And then I did it one time and just
click and it.

723
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,950
And I had,
I got a,

724
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,900
I got an extra and they're like,
yeah,

725
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:54,910
that's,
that's chipped.

726
00:32:54,911 --> 00:32:56,720
It's nothing we can do about it.
To this day,

727
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:01,260
my,
my tendons will get caught in my neck on

728
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,310
that chip and it will just lock up like
once a year,

729
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:08,270
lock up for a couple days on me,
like the tendons rub against that area.

730
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:10,940
It's tendons or ligaments or whatever is
right there around.

731
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:14,330
You're a vertebrae.
Fuck the next dude.

732
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,420
Yeah.
Terrible.

733
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,860
Terrible thing to injure you.
Are there good exercises for neck?

734
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,850
You don't have a thing called the iron
neck.

735
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:24,000
Have you ever heard of him now?
Oh,

736
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,190
that's fucking amazing.
It's out there.

737
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,740
I'll show it to you after the show.
It's a halo.

738
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,190
I've put it on my head and then I pump
it up with air and the air locks in

739
00:33:31,191 --> 00:33:34,310
place and there's a giant Bungee cord
that's on the end of it and I pull it

740
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:36,530
back and the bungee cord is a 50 pound
resistance,

741
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:39,170
but they make it lower.
They make like several different weights

742
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,520
of Bungee.
You pull it back to.

743
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:46,460
It's like fully polled and then you can
adjust the resistance on the halo itself

744
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,310
and so you do these like as you got to
pull it back,

745
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:53,930
you turn
turn sideways and I do look 10 reps this

746
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,590
way.
It'll do sideways that way and that'll

747
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,880
turn all the way behind and face the
opposite direction and do 10.

748
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,411
That's amazing.
Yeah.

749
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:02,390
And then you do stevie wonder's where
you do this,

750
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,800
you do a bunch of different exercises.

751
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,920
Magic and a girls suck your Dick with
that thing on

752
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,590
what?
She would wear it.

753
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:14,360
She would wear it and then you wouldn't
be good because her record would be in

754
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:17,990
the way you run the cord between your
legs

755
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,380
and then you put your penis in her
mouth,

756
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,900
but your Dick is going to rub up against
the court.

757
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:25,310
I don't understand why you want to do
that.

758
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,540
That's the thing like that.
Oh,

759
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,910
I see.
I got two of those.

760
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,410
I bought one for my house to a fucking.
Love it.

761
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,640
Wow.
I love it.

762
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,070
It's so for Jujitsu,
it's so important.

763
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,790
My neck fucked up in Jujitsu where I
was,

764
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:40,490
um,
I was getting numb hands.

765
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,280
I had a bulging disc in my neck and I
just,

766
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:47,210
I think a lot of it came down to my neck
just getting just too much abuse and not

767
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:47,990
being strong enough.

768
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,710
Yeah.
No.

769
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,360
So,
so I love that thing.

770
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,390
Yeah.
That's why I've never done Jujitsu.

771
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,440
I've wanted to,
but I know my neck would get fucked up

772
00:34:54,441 --> 00:34:56,060
immediately.
Everything gets fucked up,

773
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,930
but it's fun.
Yeah,

774
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,320
it's awesome.
It's like your body's not going to make

775
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:01,040
it.
Yeah.

776
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,890
It's like how much abuse do you want to
give it before it breaks?

777
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,170
Totally.
A good question.

778
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,520
You know,
I mean,

779
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,690
Anthony Bordain that fucking savage,
58 years old starts doing Jujitsu.

780
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,370
Start it.
Started.

781
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,900
No shit started.
Wow.

782
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,300
He's a bad ass because he been on the
show.

783
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,680
Yeah.
Long time ago.

784
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,750
Yeah.
So we always talk about doing it again.

785
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:25,640
But yeah,
he travels so fucking much everywhere.

786
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,220
Literally everywhere.
I love that show.

787
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:28,610
I,
I,

788
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,570
when I'm on the road at sometimes CNN
will run a marathon and he shows I'll

789
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:34,810
just sit there and watch everyone.
Even when he's in the US,

790
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,560
it's always interesting.
He finds like he'll find a pocket of

791
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:38,394
Cajun

792
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,740
people that have like a 78 people in the
family and they make this special kind

793
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,250
of jumbled Leia.

794
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

795
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,080
He's,
he's,

796
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,600
he found his thing.
Yeah.

797
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:51,430
He really did find his thing.
Was he a musician before?

798
00:35:51,431 --> 00:35:52,710
What did he do?
So chef,

799
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,360
who's the chef,
he's a chef and he wrote a book called

800
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,700
kitchen confidential is really good
book.

801
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,010
And then after the book became
successful,

802
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,470
he started doing a show on the travel
channel.

803
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,130
I think it might've even been called
kitchen kitchen confidential.

804
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:09,460
Then did another show that was called no
reservations.

805
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,340
That's where I met him.
I met him when he was still doing no

806
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:13,780
reservation,
so that's when he did.

807
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,730
He did my show back when he was doing in
my house.

808
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,360
And then,
uh,

809
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,110
I did his show.
I did it recently too.

810
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,140
I did it recently in Montana.
We went pheasant hunting.

811
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,140
No Shit.
Yeah,

812
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,270
it was pretty cool.
Oh Wow.

813
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,270
Yeah,
it was awesome.

814
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,640
Did he ever run into drugs?

815
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,540
He was a serious heroin addict.
That's what I thought.

816
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,790
Yeah,
but he kicked the heroin and still

817
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,930
drink.
Still drinks.

818
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:36,130
I know.
That's amazing.

819
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,510
Yeah.
Well he's,

820
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,580
I mean he figured out how to do it.
Yeah.

821
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,930
But he works out every day.
Yeah,

822
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,470
the trains every day.
I mean he brings his Jujitsu ski with

823
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:45,940
him everywhere he goes.
He goes on the road,

824
00:36:45,941 --> 00:36:48,400
like when we were in Montana,
he went to,

825
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:53,401
um,
we were outside of Bozeman I think

826
00:36:54,101 --> 00:36:57,430
somewhere outside of Bozeman.
So he found a Jujitsu club in Bozeman

827
00:36:57,431 --> 00:37:00,310
and met them and just went there and
trained with them during the day.

828
00:37:00,311 --> 00:37:01,480
I was like,
you're a fucking animal.

829
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,250
No,
she's addicted to it.

830
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,440
He goes to like,
he was in Croatia,

831
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:08,140
you told me it was in like,
I forget where it was,

832
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:11,290
but some Asia type place.
Some Serbia is one of them fucking

833
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:15,550
Albania with one of them crazy places.
And he said he was shitting out bone

834
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:17,290
chips because these guys were just
smashing them.

835
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,513
And I was like,
dude,

836
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,440
fucking doing that.
They were old school crossing Gracie,

837
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,920
top control guys and they're fucking
crushing him.

838
00:37:26,921 --> 00:37:27,401
And he's like,
dude,

839
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:29,800
I'm shitting bone chips.
I'm like doing of yourself.

840
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,260
That's amazing.
But he's like,

841
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,940
he's at an age where a lot of people
would,

842
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,040
they would back off,
they would think,

843
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:38,370
oh my body is frail.
I'm going to ride this off into the

844
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:39,250
sunset.
It's like,

845
00:37:39,251 --> 00:37:40,084
fuck you.

846
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:45,300
Well all exercise is really sub
sublimating pain on some level.

847
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:49,710
I mean even even a light jog,
you are in pain and so you don't have to

848
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:51,480
do it.
I think you're doing it wrong.

849
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,250
Oh,
I'm always in pain.

850
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:59,430
I feel like when I jog I feel like I
feel afraid.

851
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:02,640
I'm gonna die.
And I think when people see me jogging,

852
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,180
they think I'm running from something.
Like I'm scared.

853
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,500
Like that's the panic on my face.
What hurts my back.

854
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:15,030
I think the next settled into my back
and I have slight scoliosis.

855
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,680
So,
um,

856
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,410
and then my,
my wrists and ankles for some reason

857
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:23,190
about a year ago started to get sore.
Like I can't do pushups anymore.

858
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:26,100
I had to buy those,
those grips that you put on the ground

859
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:28,260
because I couldn't,
I can't put my hands flat.

860
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,230
What part hurts the whole wrist?
The whole.

861
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:32,790
All the ligaments in the wrist hurt.

862
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,420
Hmm.
And they hurt.

863
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,010
Does it?
An overuse thing?

864
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,860
I'd get hurt from now because it's both
of them.

865
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,080
I don't know what I could have been
doing with both of them.

866
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,170
Have you tried doing it since you cut
bread and everything out of your diet?

867
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,890
I think it probably is better.
It is better.

868
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,820
I bet it is.
Yeah.

869
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,860
That was the first thing a therapist
told me.

870
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,390
Physical therapist.
She got not a mental therapist.

871
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:54,670
Like cut bread out.
Yeah.

872
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,810
You got mental problems.
I'm no,

873
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,200
a physical therapist told me she was
like,

874
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,780
you'd be surprised if you cut bread out
of your diet.

875
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,550
Just inflammation.
Inflammation.

876
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,890
How much your back would feel better and
feel better.

877
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,980
I thought it was 100 percent horseshit.
I was like,

878
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,720
oh,
this is like hippie chiropractor.

879
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:11,590
Talk.
Good luck.

880
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,990
Yeah.
And then I did it and I was like,

881
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,000
oh.
Like everything feels better.

882
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,650
You don't realize it.

883
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,880
Like that puffy feeling that you get in
your face though.

884
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:24,280
I get,
I get fat face if I,

885
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:26,500
uh,
if I eat too much bread and pasta,

886
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,311
I get,
you know,

887
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:30,310
you start getting a little gut,
but that's also in your joints,

888
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,450
man.
That's everywhere.

889
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:34,390
Everything's inflamed.
So it's all like not good.

890
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,180
Your body's like,
what is this shit and how do we get rid

891
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:39,430
of this?
It's fucking hard on the road not to eat

892
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:41,590
bread dough.
It's so hard to find a meal.

893
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:43,720
It doesn't have bread and unless you
want to eat like,

894
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,800
you know,
some,

895
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,800
some salad from starbucks,
so uninspired salad and it was made by

896
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:53,560
somebody with a hair net that was also
making like stale,

897
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,530
stale tasting muffins.
They come out of the oven,

898
00:39:56,531 --> 00:40:01,531
they're already stale tasting.
I was at a starbucks recently and there

899
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,900
was a played out with,
you know,

900
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,080
they put the muffin pieces while you're
waiting.

901
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,800
And so I,
I eat more than I should,

902
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,430
you know,
you should probably just have one I

903
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:11,710
think is the protocol.
And I have like three of them.

904
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,070
And uh,
this woman comes up,

905
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,210
she goes,
why are you eating my muffin?

906
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,910
It was hers.
I go,

907
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:23,230
I'm so sorry,
I go,

908
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:25,480
let me buy you another muffin.
And,

909
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,590
and instead of going,
Nah,

910
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,580
don't worry about.
She was like,

911
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:30,580
yeah.
So I bought her another muffin and she

912
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:32,770
wasn't really like laughing about it or
anything.

913
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:34,470
She was.
Yeah,

914
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,450
yeah.
You were saying that.

915
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:39,460
I was like,
I don't know that they do that.

916
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,490
Oh fuck yeah.
Fuck off coffee shops.

917
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,710
Starbucks.
Yeah.

918
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,690
But why was there a muffin chopped up
into little pieces that seems weird to.

919
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,650
I was crummy.
It was kind of pulled apart crummy.

920
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,910
Hmm.
Yeah.

921
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,090
Okay.
Seems Weird.

922
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,270
Have you ever,
um,

923
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:05,430
gone to Katz Deli in New York shore?
Remember when the Ludlow Stromae for

924
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:06,280
you?
Yeah.

925
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,890
And the corn beef and they give you a
little bit and you're like,

926
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:11,340
Holy Shit.
Like while you're waiting,

927
00:41:11,341 --> 00:41:14,680
they chop it up and slide it forward and
best Pastrami in the city.

928
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,270
Yeah,
we just looked it up the other day.

929
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:17,950
That place started out in the 18
hundreds.

930
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:19,190
No Shit.
Yeah.

931
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,170
Wow.
Yeah.

932
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:22,860
Largo was a half a block away,
so if you stand up there and I always

933
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:26,990
stop and get a pastrami sandwich.
There was a a no Luna Lounge.

934
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:27,824
He was.
Oh,

935
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,440
okay.
Yeah.

936
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,150
There's no place like that here except
canter's cancers.

937
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,070
All right.
It's

938
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,680
a,
you know,

939
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,170
I,
I find their astronomy's just doesn't

940
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:42,680
have that.
That tenderness that you get Second

941
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,720
Avenue Deli in New York.
Never been.

942
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,240
That's the best.
That is the best.

943
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:48,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

944
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:49,880
I think.
I think cancers is good.

945
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,760
I think it's the best in La.
I do too.

946
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:53,930
I just don't think it's that good.

947
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,760
Well,
he just not gonna it's hard to get those

948
00:41:56,761 --> 00:42:01,440
immigrants to come all the way across
and settle in and be successful out here

949
00:42:01,441 --> 00:42:03,100
and have like a real spot.
Right.

950
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,250
But there's a lot of Jewish people out
here.

951
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,040
You'd think there'd be more like Jerry's
Deli is good.

952
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:09,220
Middle of the road.
Yeah.

953
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,580
They have good chicken noodle soup.
Right.

954
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,600
But they don't have.
It's like there's a difference between a

955
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:20,580
real Italian restaurant in New York City
and an Italian restaurant in studio

956
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:21,301
city.
Yeah.

957
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:23,070
Right.
Just fucking different.

958
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:24,600
Yeah.
There's just no getting around it.

959
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,540
If you want to survive and like I needed
just to survive.

960
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:31,380
You can have linguine with clams at some
nice place to studio city,

961
00:42:31,381 --> 00:42:32,520
but it won't be the same.
Yeah.

962
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,640
Now that place car a car.
Mine's.

963
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,320
What's our.
Our tourists.

964
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,580
There's a place on Mulberry Street that
was the oldest Italian restaurant in New

965
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,040
Year in a little Italy and it just
burned down.

966
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,780
Dude,
I remember when you lived in little

967
00:42:45,781 --> 00:42:48,620
Italy in a mob owned building.
Yeah.

968
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,750
Tony and gladys

969
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,420
from my landlords.
That's right.

970
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,090
And they had a.
they'd had the apartment.

971
00:42:54,091 --> 00:42:56,490
They raised their kids there and they
were like,

972
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,330
they were like in their late seventies
and so they,

973
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,440
their,
their son Gregory who was in

974
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:08,450
construction and lived in directly or
quotes in construction and so he bought

975
00:43:08,611 --> 00:43:10,710
them a condo around the corner because
it was a,

976
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:14,820
it was a six floor walk up and so one
free.

977
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,500
You can pull it up on the screen.
One 42.

978
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:18,210
Mulberry.
Explain to people that don't know what

979
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:20,340
that means.
That means you walk up six flights of

980
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:22,320
stairs,
couches and shit.

981
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,340
Yeah,
right,

982
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,211
right.
Well,

983
00:43:24,211 --> 00:43:25,950
they're all,
their furniture was there when I got

984
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:27,360
there,
they let me keep and it was,

985
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:31,080
I'm not making this up,
plastic on the furniture and I found,

986
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,160
uh,
I found,

987
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,950
uh,
an ease of phone eavesdropping thing

988
00:43:34,951 --> 00:43:39,610
like where you could record phone calls
in the drawer and um,

989
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,870
they deiced to pay them the rent once a
month,

990
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,770
not by check.
They wanted cash and it was George

991
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:50,940
Mcdonald live with me and we would walk
down this end and Lauren debraski would

992
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:55,140
walk down the street to Spring Street,
go to their condo and we'd give them,

993
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,130
if it was $600,
we'd give that to gladys and Tony look

994
00:43:59,131 --> 00:43:59,964
at it,
right?

995
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,823
Yeah,
there we go.

996
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,400
And they would make cappuccinos and
Canelo lease.

997
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:07,230
We'd sit there and talk to them and then
Tony would go in the next room and we

998
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:10,590
give gladys another 150 [inaudible].
That was her bingo money.

999
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,270
And Tony don't need to know about that.
Oh,

1000
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:12,610
that.

1001
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:13,400
Oh,
that's right.

1002
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,590
Yeah.
And uh,

1003
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,240
they were having a Lauren Dubroski she
passed away.

1004
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,040
No cancer.
Oh,

1005
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:21,060
that's right.
Yeah.

1006
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:25,110
She ended up as a big executive producer
at mad tv for like 10 years.

1007
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,160
Really?
Yeah.

1008
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:27,290
You know Bobby Lee,
she,

1009
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:30,420
she sponsored a lot of people to get
sober.

1010
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,230
I mean,
you,

1011
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,050
I know a half a dozen people that she
sponsored to get sober.

1012
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:36,150
Bobby Lee is one of them.
She was,

1013
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,360
she was a comedy team with.
Yeah,

1014
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,940
a couple of,
couple of broads.

1015
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,520
I don't remember what their name was.
Who was the,

1016
00:44:43,521 --> 00:44:45,300
I think it was called a couple of broad.
Who was the,

1017
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,380
uh,
the other one was uh.

1018
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:48,990
Oh,
is there.

1019
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,650
Fuck.
Rick Jenkins used to date her.

1020
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,270
Yes.
And she ended up doing a film.

1021
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,110
She moved out to Hollywood to make it
and uh,

1022
00:44:58,111 --> 00:45:03,090
about a year and a half later this
softcore porn came up with her in it and

1023
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:07,740
she had the sickest body smoking and
that was a vhs tape to kept passed

1024
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:09,540
around.
That was greasy.

1025
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,370
Covered in DNA.

1026
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,280
Yeah.
Um,

1027
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,610
but lauren was a really sweet,
special person.

1028
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,920
She was great.
She's a very nice person.

1029
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,491
Yeah,
that's right.

1030
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:26,160
I forgot that she passed away.
I never ran into.

1031
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:30,690
I ran into her once out here a long time
ago.

1032
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,270
More than 15,
16 years ago.

1033
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:38,300
Yeah.
There is those comics that are that like

1034
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:40,590
Colin Quinn is.
One of them were just.

1035
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:43,050
They have saved so many comics in
trouble.

1036
00:45:43,051 --> 00:45:44,340
It's amazing.
How's he?

1037
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,230
Oh yeah,
a great guy.

1038
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,070
Yeah.
He helped,

1039
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,960
uh,
well tried to help Geraldo.

1040
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:52,260
I shouldn't name people's names if it's
program stuff,

1041
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:53,190
but a,
well,

1042
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:54,690
some people are open about it.
Yeah.

1043
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,170
I think all comics are,
becomes a part of your fucking back.

1044
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,031
Right?
Right.

1045
00:46:00,031 --> 00:46:00,864
And who,
who,

1046
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,240
who gets sober and doesn't start talking
about it.

1047
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,070
Yeah.
That's like Jesus Christ.

1048
00:46:05,071 --> 00:46:09,030
Why wouldn't you mind that?
I think a lot of comics start in a

1049
00:46:09,031 --> 00:46:10,180
rooms.
They get up and they,

1050
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,310
you know,
they qualify,

1051
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:13,520
which is when you speak in a room and
they go,

1052
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,970
oh yeah.
Remember Dave,

1053
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:20,030
right dave out fucking one great joke of
remember this one great joke that he had

1054
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:25,920
about being in Catholic school and he
did something wrong and the priest

1055
00:46:25,921 --> 00:46:29,520
smacked him in the head and he goes,
which is exactly how I think Jesus would

1056
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:30,354
have handled it.

1057
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:39,510
And she,
this method of delivery,

1058
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:41,340
you know,
he was just a funny guy.

1059
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,800
Like he was one of those guys that you
saw him on stage.

1060
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,061
You Go,
oh,

1061
00:46:44,061 --> 00:46:45,790
this guy's got to be funny.
Oh,

1062
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,360
I mean it's,
it's amazing.

1063
00:46:48,361 --> 00:46:51,620
Some people that the deck is loaded,
you walk on stage.

1064
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:55,230
He's had this gravelly voice and this
big square head.

1065
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,320
And he just said yes,
as soon as that thick.

1066
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:01,530
I think he was from East Boston,
that thick accent.

1067
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:03,120
And He,
when he was a fucking mailman,

1068
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:06,900
he was like a real blue collar guy and a
lifetime of stories.

1069
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,630
Yeah.
He's a guy who became a pro real quick.

1070
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,940
Yes.
I remember like being real impressed

1071
00:47:11,941 --> 00:47:14,820
with him because he was like a little
bit ahead of me.

1072
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,890
I was,
I was starting out as an open mic or,

1073
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:21,891
and he was real maybe a year ahead and
he was starting to get work and I'm

1074
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,540
like,
this guy fucking took it seriously.

1075
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,130
Yeah,
because he was older.

1076
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:30,010
I think he was 40 when he was getting
started and so he

1077
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,210
had his notebook and he was like really
organized with his bets and he had like

1078
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:38,920
some philosophy about like why he would,
why would take a pause and why he would

1079
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:41,860
rush this part where he would take that
part and I was like,

1080
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:45,250
this guy's putting a lot of thought and
effort into.

1081
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,380
I remember going down to see Paula
poundstone perform at the comedy

1082
00:47:49,381 --> 00:47:53,640
connection and he was the feature act
and he went up and as the feature got a

1083
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:55,200
standing ovation.
I was like,

1084
00:47:55,201 --> 00:47:58,080
Holy Shit.
That doesn't happen.

1085
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,311
No,
he was good.

1086
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:01,260
He got sick.
He got sick and died as well.

1087
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:02,330
Yeah,
right.

1088
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:07,340
I think this is just a lifetime of drugs
and alcohol just caught up to him

1089
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:10,650
unfortunately.
Right when he was right when he was,

1090
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,180
you know,
getting his shit together.

1091
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:13,043
Right,
right.

1092
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,730
There was so many of those guys.
I mean,

1093
00:48:14,731 --> 00:48:18,750
how many guys did we start out with that
were alcoholics or former alcoholics?

1094
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,130
Yeah.
Fucking everybody.

1095
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:21,023
All of them.

1096
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,091
Yeah.
And they're all.

1097
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:24,760
And that was the thing about when you
were an open or a Boston,

1098
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:29,350
it was like the criteria.
Where are you funny enough to cover 15

1099
00:48:29,351 --> 00:48:33,070
minutes to open number two,
do you have a functioning automobile

1100
00:48:33,071 --> 00:48:36,010
that you can take these dui headliners
to the Gig with?

1101
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,600
Because none of them had licenses.
And so I can remember like picking up

1102
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:44,680
Gavin Pickin up sweetie,
picking up Mike Mcdonald and having to

1103
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:47,680
drive these guys out to wherever.
And then you couldn't leave early

1104
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:50,920
because you were driving them home.
They'd give you a few bucks for gas and

1105
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:51,880
you were happy to do it.
You're like,

1106
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:53,560
Holy Shit,
I'm going to be in a car with don.

1107
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,980
And so one time nick's next stop calling
me up and they're like,

1108
00:48:56,981 --> 00:49:00,160
you're working in Framingham.
You get to drive the feature and the

1109
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:03,460
headliner out.
And I go downtown to pick them up in

1110
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:05,280
front of Nick's.
And I've got a uh,

1111
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,970
I had a 1976 Volkswagen Rabbit,
four cylinder,

1112
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:14,890
rusted out floor boards and I get down
there and it's Mike Sullivan,

1113
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:19,891
Irwin who weighed about 300 pounds.
And John Pinette is about to 75 and they

1114
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:25,200
saw my car and they both started
giggling like school girls.

1115
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,280
We're going to fucking go to a Gig in
this car.

1116
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:30,720
So we,
we pack them in and I couldn't get on.

1117
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,780
I couldn't get the car go on above like
40.

1118
00:49:32,781 --> 00:49:35,330
So instead of taking the mass pike at
West to Framingham,

1119
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:39,320
I had to take a route nine the whole
way.

1120
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,010
Forty miles an hour.

1121
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:45,540
Hilarious.
Like you carry lumber on the roof.

1122
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:52,020
Fucking 800 pounds of humans in my car.
I remember Mike Sullivan,

1123
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,730
but I remember when he was Mike
Sullivan,

1124
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,000
they became like Sullivan Irvin.
He's the first guy that ever met that

1125
00:49:57,001 --> 00:49:59,770
took his wife's last name.
Is that why?

1126
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:03,680
Yeah,
he was a feminist first male feminists.

1127
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,270
Self proclaimed male feminists that
everyone too.

1128
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,130
It's hilarious.
Very nice guy.

1129
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,510
Yeah,
sweetheart.

1130
00:50:09,511 --> 00:50:12,100
Super Sweetheart Guy.
And uh,

1131
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:15,150
that didn't work.
He stopped doing comedy,

1132
00:50:15,151 --> 00:50:16,140
right?
I think he died.

1133
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,880
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

1134
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:19,950
It's a bummer.
It's a bummer of a podcast.

1135
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:23,070
I think he died as well.
And John Pinette died as well as well,

1136
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,600
you know.
Yeah.

1137
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,380
That's why.
I'm glad you're doing cardio.

1138
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,740
That's right.
Well,

1139
00:50:29,741 --> 00:50:32,740
you know,
I'm 51 and my dad died at 51 of a heart

1140
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:34,840
attack,
so I take that shit seriously.

1141
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,800
Eating right and exercising.
I mean he also smoked three and a half

1142
00:50:38,801 --> 00:50:41,200
packs a day and was an alcoholic.
So different,

1143
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,810
different circumstances.
It is crazy

1144
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,540
how much of that shit is genetic,
you know?

1145
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,100
Yeah.
And I've always admired that.

1146
00:50:47,101 --> 00:50:49,770
You figured out when we were really
young.

1147
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,590
I mean when I met you,
you quit and you know,

1148
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,560
we were both in our early twenties and
you were like,

1149
00:50:55,561 --> 00:50:57,300
fuck this.
I'm not,

1150
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:59,760
I'm not going down that road.
And you didn't need anything.

1151
00:50:59,761 --> 00:51:01,930
You didn't,
you didn't need alcoholics anonymous.

1152
00:51:01,931 --> 00:51:02,764
So you're like,
no,

1153
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,953
not doing it.

1154
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:06,140
I did some therapy.
That helps.

1155
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,320
I just needed to realize that once I
realized that and I had gone to Alanon

1156
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:14,390
because of my dad,
adult child of alcoholic meetings,

1157
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:17,660
which helped me phenomenal amount just
to realize that,

1158
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:20,300
um,
that it's a disease and that,

1159
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,860
you know,
you're powerless to it.

1160
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:25,730
And that for me,
I was able to apply what I learned in

1161
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:29,330
there because I went to a couple of AA
meetings and in Boston it was like guys

1162
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:32,570
would get up and they were like,
and then I blow a guy for a sandwich and

1163
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:35,740
I passed out in the fucking and said,
you know,

1164
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,250
it's like I couldn't relate.
I mean,

1165
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:39,170
my thing was like,
I fucked a fat chick,

1166
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,490
you know,
that was my bottom.

1167
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:45,590
I had a three way with a couple girls
who were a plus net.

1168
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,060
And so,
uh,

1169
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:48,080
so I could,
but I,

1170
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:51,080
but I,
I read the literature of the 12 steps

1171
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:54,140
and it helped me because it made me
realize that when I wanted to drink

1172
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:58,730
something was going on and to this day I
just have that reaction.

1173
00:51:58,731 --> 00:52:01,250
I know that I still want to drink all
the time,

1174
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,560
but when I really want to drink I
stopped and I go,

1175
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,030
alright,
what's stressing you out?

1176
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:07,580
What do you need to deal with?
And then I just kind of focus on it.

1177
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,710
No,
yeah,

1178
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:10,603
there was,
um,

1179
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,290
when I was a kid,
my,

1180
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,010
my dad was an architect.
And so I worked on a lot of construction

1181
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:19,790
sites and I met a lot of junkies,
a lot of junkies,

1182
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:23,540
lot of people in construction sites are
either alcoholics or drug addicts.

1183
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:25,850
And there was this one guy that I really
liked.

1184
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,920
He's a funny guy,
man.

1185
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,260
Really Funny Guy.
And he's in a band,

1186
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:32,510
his name was Robbie.
Funny fucking dude.

1187
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:36,970
Loved hanging around with them,
but just stay off the coke wow.

1188
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:40,220
Couldn't stay off the coke and you could
totally tell he was.

1189
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:43,520
And he would,
he'd be honest about it to see how he

1190
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,740
went off the rails and you know,
and you know,

1191
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,540
and he would,
we would be working together.

1192
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:49,920
He was a carpenter and I was like,
uh,

1193
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,953
uh,
labor.

1194
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:54,260
So I was like an apprentice.
And so he'd be talking to me,

1195
00:52:54,261 --> 00:52:56,090
why?
Explain to me how to do things and stuff

1196
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:57,740
like that.
And I was like,

1197
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:58,251
yeah,
you know,

1198
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:00,380
I'm just fucking tired of this.
I'm getting my shit together.

1199
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,470
The bands getting back together again,
we're writing songs and this and that.

1200
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:07,570
And then he'd come in Monday looking
like shit,

1201
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,570
just looking like shit real grumpy.
Didn't want to talk,

1202
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,570
had a headache and you know,
and he didn't get it,

1203
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:15,723
went off the rails

1204
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,830
May.
The saddest thing is that when you first

1205
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:20,720
start doing drugs,
and I don't know about you,

1206
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:23,540
but I,
I had a phenomenal time doing cocaine,

1207
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:28,160
mushrooms and all this stuff I did as a
teenager was like beef.

1208
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,930
I never got hooked on it and if you do
it,

1209
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,530
you know,
maybe I did coke 50 times without ever

1210
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:36,420
getting hooked.
It's a blast.

1211
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,510
That's the,
that's the best kept secret.

1212
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:42,140
But then once you get hooked,
you're not even having fun anymore.

1213
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:45,980
You're just maintaining.
You're just feeding it so you don't

1214
00:53:45,981 --> 00:53:47,180
crash.
You know,

1215
00:53:47,181 --> 00:53:47,961
with,
with heroin,

1216
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:51,470
you're just trying to avoid withdrawals.
You're not even feeling that great

1217
00:53:51,471 --> 00:53:52,180
anymore.

1218
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:55,900
I think with Robbie to,
part of the problem was he was very

1219
00:53:55,901 --> 00:53:57,560
disappointed in himself.
Yeah,

1220
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,480
know it was booze too.
He would just go off the rails and try

1221
00:54:01,481 --> 00:54:02,201
to keep it going.
You know,

1222
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:05,380
it's like
there's a lot of people out there that

1223
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,310
they have a dream and then the pressure
of trying to reach that dream,

1224
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:11,530
like his dream is to be in a successful
band.

1225
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:13,960
Right.
And the pressure of trying to reach that

1226
00:54:13,961 --> 00:54:17,890
dream and see it to fruition,
it's just seems it seems unreachable.

1227
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,330
Yeah.
It seems too far off.

1228
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,030
And here you are,
you're in your thirties and you're

1229
00:54:22,031 --> 00:54:27,031
working a construction job and you know,
you fucking work all day in Boston in

1230
00:54:27,041 --> 00:54:30,250
the winter.
You're tired as shit when you get home,

1231
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:33,790
you don't want to go to band practice.
You get home at 6:30,

1232
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:36,880
have dinner now it's 7:30.
You got to get up,

1233
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,570
right?
You've got to get up in a few hours.

1234
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,300
What are you doing?
When are you going to bed?

1235
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,740
You know,
you've got to get up at six.

1236
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,660
Then you got a band

1237
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,750
practice and the drummer doesn't shell
up so you can't practice.

1238
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,230
So our 45 minutes late,
his car breaks down and you're fucking

1239
00:54:49,231 --> 00:54:52,290
pissed and you're screaming at you.
Yeah,

1240
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:53,001
yeah,
yeah.

1241
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:54,860
And then try to have a relationship on
top of that.

1242
00:54:54,861 --> 00:54:58,550
Tell that girl you can't go out on
Saturday night ever because you're doing

1243
00:54:58,551 --> 00:54:59,384
gigs

1244
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,320
and then the gigs suck and you're not
making any money.

1245
00:55:02,321 --> 00:55:04,700
And she should get a job.
The gigs.

1246
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:07,010
You should get a job.
Yeah.

1247
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,080
And then you're in a band.
So girls,

1248
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:10,870
they've thrown themselves at you having
an affair.

1249
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,010
She's got some coke.

1250
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:13,810
No,
it's good.

1251
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,390
No story turned around.
Turned it around.

1252
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:16,230
Now it's exciting again.

1253
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,720
Sometimes when I've worked at casino,
there will always be that band in the

1254
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:30,470
lounge just playing like born to be wild
and all the songs and like you'll see

1255
00:55:30,471 --> 00:55:35,471
people that are like 57 dancing and you
see them in their dancing and it's like

1256
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:40,520
they're just reliving the only joy they
had in their life,

1257
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:44,510
which was like when they were young
dance in Iraq and this band is fucking

1258
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,640
their gods.
To them

1259
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,940
you the,
the time when you're young,

1260
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,900
when you're having fun is so fleeting.
Yeah.

1261
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:00,060
Then all of a sudden responsibility
stuck up and all of a sudden you know,

1262
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:03,650
you have to pay bills,
you have obligations,

1263
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:06,080
you have so much that you have to think
about.

1264
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,480
Yeah.
For so many people,

1265
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:11,690
there's just.
There's this period of their life where

1266
00:56:11,691 --> 00:56:15,740
they look back to whimsically like that
was the time when I was free.

1267
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:19,670
I was young,
my Dick got hurt all the time.

1268
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,910
I could go two or three times,

1269
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,080
three times in a night like,
shit,

1270
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,780
man,
I can't believe it.

1271
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:31,000
And you think anything is possible.
I mean,

1272
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:34,180
that's really can happen.
That's the loss of innocence is when you

1273
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:38,230
realize that a certain point that you do
have to pick a path and stay on it,

1274
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:44,080
you better [inaudible] you gotta pay the
bills with it and you know what's so sad

1275
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:48,550
is you see people that work so fucking
hard for not a lot of money and you

1276
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:50,560
know,
Bill's just add up and then they save

1277
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:53,350
just enough when they get their vacation
twice a year,

1278
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,800
the good like accrues and they'll just
drink nonstop for a week.

1279
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,870
At the end of it,
they're just hung over.

1280
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:04,690
They blew the excess money they had and
that was it.

1281
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,590
That's what you worked all year for out
a friend of mine and working in

1282
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,050
restaurant and uh,
one of the guys who worked with saved up

1283
00:57:11,051 --> 00:57:14,690
his money for eight years,
went to Vegas and ballooned in one day.

1284
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,710
It was the most heartbreaking story.
This poor guy,

1285
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:28,330
I think he was a dishwasher and he
worked there for eight years.

1286
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:31,700
Set aside 50 here.
Twenty five.

1287
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,520
They're set aside for eight fucking
years.

1288
00:57:35,521 --> 00:57:37,720
Yeah.
And I think it was some good amount of

1289
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:39,330
money,
like $30,000.

1290
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:43,090
She went there with a plan.
This is it baby.

1291
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,640
I'm good at blackjack or whatever the
fuck he played.

1292
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,490
He read a book.
A lot of guys read books.

1293
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:52,210
You can win money,
you can win money playing blackjack,

1294
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,850
but you know what's fucked up when you
do,

1295
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:56,920
if you get good at it,
they ban you.

1296
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,610
I know.
It's crazy was.

1297
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,730
Yeah.
The other crazy thing is in black jack

1298
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:08,440
there's there's like multitech and
they're single deck blackjack and the

1299
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:12,820
payout on single deck is less instead of
three to two odds you get paid like,

1300
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,130
I forget what it is,
but you get,

1301
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:18,460
you get less of a payout when you hit
black Jack and the rules and more

1302
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,370
restrictive about like splitting aces
and all that stuff.

1303
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:26,890
So the implication is with a single deck
you can count cards.

1304
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:31,510
That's why they pay you less,
but if you get caught counting cards,

1305
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,340
you get thrown out of the casino,
the fuck.

1306
00:58:33,341 --> 00:58:38,341
Did they catch you counting cards and
isn't it normal that you are using

1307
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,350
strategy to try to win the game like
crazy.

1308
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,570
Like you can't try so hard,
right?

1309
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:46,090
That's like if you're playing pool and
you aim the aim Ayman

1310
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:49,840
or when they don't let you use drugs in
sports,

1311
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,090
man,
they make you better.

1312
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:55,750
They definitely make you better.
Why should we not have drugs in sports?

1313
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,660
Well,
because were out of your body because

1314
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:00,790
you don't want the children to get the
wrong message.

1315
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,860
You're writing and drugs are the only
way to win.

1316
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:05,890
Yeah.
I think that should be a supernaturally

1317
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,570
and the natural league.
I like it.

1318
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:08,723
Yeah.
Yeah.

1319
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:12,630
Supernaturally is you just go get one of
them fucking Russian guys from that

1320
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,590
Icarus documentary and you just.

1321
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:15,820
What do you got,
baby?

1322
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,460
Let's do this shit and you find out what
happens.

1323
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:24,060
The problem is legitimately,
if you do go whole hog and take the

1324
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:30,080
fucking full steroid route,
you're definitely redlining your body.

1325
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:32,830
You're doing some shit to your body that
your endocrine system is gonna.

1326
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,620
Shut down.
You're putting ungodly stress on all

1327
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:39,880
sorts of parts of your body because the
workload that your body's putting out is

1328
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:44,890
just super human.
But for those brief shining moments,

1329
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:49,820
you can absolutely performed better on.
That's what it's about.

1330
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:53,300
And as a viewer,
I want to see them run faster and hit

1331
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:58,220
harder and jump higher and you know,
and honestly they're jocks.

1332
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:00,290
This is what they were bred to do.
They are,

1333
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,240
they are the jock class,
pe.

1334
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:05,210
They did it their whole lives.
They've dreamed of the shining moment.

1335
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,100
Let them have their shining moment.

1336
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,790
Right?
But what about the natural athletes?

1337
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,710
What about the Hershel Walker's out
there that don't need it?

1338
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,970
All right.
Well,

1339
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:15,650
they're in the other league.
Well,

1340
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,640
for them they're like,
well,

1341
01:00:16,641 --> 01:00:19,250
you shouldn't be a fucking athlete and
know I need it.

1342
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,420
Right.
Or I don't need it.

1343
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,160
You need it.
Yeah.

1344
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,750
But I always wondered about those guys
because they'd be honest that they don't

1345
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,330
take it.
Like Hershel Walker look deep into his

1346
01:00:29,331 --> 01:00:31,940
forties,
was claiming that he never took anything

1347
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,600
and uh,
that he only ate a bowl of soup and a

1348
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:36,920
salad a day.
No,

1349
01:00:36,921 --> 01:00:38,800
shit doesn't make sense.
It didn't,

1350
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:41,060
didn't his mother do the Campbell's soup
commercial.

1351
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:44,210
I don't know.
The thing about Herschel though is that

1352
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:48,810
he also has multiple personality
disorder or no shit.

1353
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:54,070
I think he has um,
stress or trauma induced trauma induced

1354
01:00:55,251 --> 01:01:00,251
multiple personality disorder.
So it's entirely possible that when he

1355
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:03,140
says,
I only took a bowl of soup and a salad,

1356
01:01:03,141 --> 01:01:05,150
he's telling the truth,
but that's him.

1357
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:08,150
There's like five other people that live
inside his brain and they've been eating

1358
01:01:08,151 --> 01:01:10,160
steak all day steroids.
Right.

1359
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,200
I don't know.
Fascinating.

1360
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,820
I'm always the trauma.
Do you know?

1361
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,360
Well,
I think he had a really rough childhood.

1362
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,290
There was a lot of psychological abuse,
physical abuse,

1363
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,840
and then there was football abuse.
I think all those things.

1364
01:01:23,841 --> 01:01:26,960
I mean there is no way you're getting
out of football for free.

1365
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,380
You're getting fucking hit hard and
that's trauma.

1366
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:32,270
So there's trauma,
psychological trauma.

1367
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:34,820
I don't know.
He's talked about it pretty openly

1368
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:37,040
though.
But what's interesting is even after all

1369
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:39,230
that he still fought.
He fought.

1370
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,300
A lot of people don't know.
He fought in strikeforce.

1371
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,820
I didn't know that.
Pete the Fuck Addison people,

1372
01:01:43,821 --> 01:01:45,750
dude,
he's a legit martial artist.

1373
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:50,420
Shit Dude.
He was in his forties like 46 to 48.

1374
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:55,340
I believe he fought in strikeforce and
when I say he was jacked,

1375
01:01:55,341 --> 01:02:00,341
I mean Jack full six pack,
shredded 46 years old.

1376
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:07,151
Just manhandling lesser athletes and
beating the fuck out of them in what you

1377
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:12,430
Jitsu mma and he fought in strikeforce.
Strikeforce was a league that the UFC

1378
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:17,260
one that purchasing and we took all
their fighters and it came over in.

1379
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:20,070
A lot of guys like Gilbert Melendez

1380
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,560
was champ over there.
Josh Thompson,

1381
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:24,960
like real high level fighters,
Luke rockhold,

1382
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:29,961
they all came over from strikeforce and
Herschel Walker was over there and it's

1383
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:33,030
a lot of people like super skeptical.
Like,

1384
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,890
what is this some freak show?
Herschel Walker is gonna fight.

1385
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,980
Come on man.
Herschel Walker is an old football

1386
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:42,540
player and then you see him.
You're like Jesus Freak athlete.

1387
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:45,210
Just a freak of nature.
So you think he must've been using

1388
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:46,044
steroids?
No,

1389
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:47,160
no,
it's not.

1390
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,900
Not.
Must have no need.

1391
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:50,790
Definitely.
I mean always get suspicious when you

1392
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:52,800
see someone who's a freak,
but there are real freaks.

1393
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:56,160
Like just let John Holmes had a giant
Dick.

1394
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,720
It didn't take steroids to have a giant
Dick.

1395
01:02:57,721 --> 01:03:00,540
He just had a giant Dick.
Some girls have enormous tits.

1396
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:01,740
Why?
Oh,

1397
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,830
they just do like there's no,
there's no even body,

1398
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:09,930
like there's no equality in physical
construction and some people just get

1399
01:03:09,931 --> 01:03:11,900
born with freak body parts.
Yeah.

1400
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:14,400
And they just are.
There's,

1401
01:03:14,401 --> 01:03:17,880
there's athletes that are just way
better than you will ever be no matter

1402
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:18,714
what you do.
Yeah.

1403
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:22,770
I think Hershel Walker's unquestionably
one of those.

1404
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,420
It's just how long did you maintain it?

1405
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:26,950
I mean,
I watched the Olympics and I'm the

1406
01:03:26,951 --> 01:03:28,200
curling.
I love,

1407
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:29,710
you know,
curling.

1408
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:31,930
The thing is,
is it's not much to watch,

1409
01:03:31,931 --> 01:03:36,931
but I would pay a lot of money to just
fucking get high one day and curl.

1410
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,190
Really?
How much out of money?

1411
01:03:39,191 --> 01:03:40,870
$50,000.
Housing dollars.

1412
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,120
Thousand dollars to curl.
One day.

1413
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,010
Why?
But I mean that's for all my friends,

1414
01:03:45,011 --> 01:03:48,280
it pays for the whole curling corey the
whole day.

1415
01:03:48,281 --> 01:03:49,780
Everybody get bored after like 10
minutes.

1416
01:03:49,781 --> 01:03:52,600
I don't know really.
I mean I love games like that.

1417
01:03:52,601 --> 01:03:54,670
Like I love a ladder ball,
you know,

1418
01:03:54,671 --> 01:03:57,820
where this like a two sticks and it's
got like a ladder that goes between it

1419
01:03:57,821 --> 01:04:01,210
and its got a ball with a rope between
the two balls and you whip it.

1420
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,030
I can play that for upwards of three or
four hours.

1421
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,600
We have it in the backyard three or four
hours nonstop.

1422
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:10,780
I just get,
I get so competitive and so obsessed.

1423
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,390
Uh,
horseshoes,

1424
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,780
Botchy Ball,
horseshoes or fun?

1425
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

1426
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:18,800
I don't know man.
Just get into such a groove.

1427
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,510
Like Pool,
right?

1428
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,110
Yeah.
No,

1429
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:24,530
I mean you and I have played pool for
three hours easily.

1430
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,460
Oh yeah.
Easily.

1431
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,780
We could have today,
if we didn't stop and do the podcast,

1432
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,790
we probably would have kept going.

1433
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:31,670
Well son is a good luck to Sam,
Ohio today.

1434
01:04:31,671 --> 01:04:35,360
And the soccer playoffs third round
undefeated this year.

1435
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:40,820
Do you like watching soccer?
I love watching it,

1436
01:04:40,821 --> 01:04:45,740
but I love watching my son play.
There's few joys in the world like

1437
01:04:45,741 --> 01:04:47,630
watching my son play soccer.
It's crazy,

1438
01:04:47,631 --> 01:04:49,520
right?
A person who's out there running around.

1439
01:04:49,521 --> 01:04:50,510
Yeah,
I know.

1440
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:51,380
And you just see.
Well,

1441
01:04:51,381 --> 01:04:55,220
because no matter how old your kid gets,
you still see them as a little kid and

1442
01:04:55,221 --> 01:04:58,100
then when you see them out there on the
field with these and you see the size of

1443
01:04:58,101 --> 01:05:00,560
the other guys and how aggressive they
are and you're like,

1444
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,990
Holy Shit,
my little kid is in there holding his

1445
01:05:02,991 --> 01:05:07,220
own and he's a physical player and uh,
it's just uh,

1446
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:10,430
and you know,
you get to know the parents and the kids

1447
01:05:10,431 --> 01:05:13,280
and it's like a whole,
it's like being a fan of a sport,

1448
01:05:13,281 --> 01:05:14,990
but you actually know the players.
Yeah.

1449
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:15,740
Uh,

1450
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:16,910
there's,
there's something,

1451
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:22,320
I think that's incredibly important for
kids to learn how to compete and also

1452
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:25,750
learn what it feels like to lose and
that bad feeling.

1453
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:27,420
Yeah,
it was a lot of people that grew up and

1454
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,470
they were never involved in competitive
sports.

1455
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:33,100
They were never involved in any sort of
competitive games and they just don't

1456
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:36,550
know what it's like to lose.
And I think that's a valuable lesson in

1457
01:05:36,551 --> 01:05:39,610
life to.
I think it teaches you a lot about

1458
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:44,350
rejection from the opposite sex or the
same sex we are in that shit.

1459
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:47,620
Um,
I think it teaches you a lot about not

1460
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:51,010
getting the job that you want a lot.
I think it teaches you a lot about real

1461
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:53,050
competition in the real world and it
gets,

1462
01:05:53,051 --> 01:05:57,400
you used to that weird feeling of
competing at a young age.

1463
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:58,830
So it becomes normal,
you know?

1464
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,100
Yeah.
To Go.

1465
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:01,510
Well,
because I think there's,

1466
01:06:01,511 --> 01:06:04,360
um,
there's a shame with being competitive

1467
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:07,810
these days because everything is so
politically correct that you shouldn't

1468
01:06:07,811 --> 01:06:10,290
be an Alpha,
you shouldn't be progressive,

1469
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:15,250
you shouldn't try to beat somebody down.
And in sports it gives you a safe place

1470
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:18,730
to realize that that's a part of our
makeup that's a part of your,

1471
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:22,510
your whole psyche is to want to compete.
You want to challenge,

1472
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:25,120
you know,
to beat Darwinian and that there is a

1473
01:06:25,121 --> 01:06:27,790
place to do it.
And then there's a place to not do it.

1474
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:32,110
Yeah.
Well it's easier to find the place to

1475
01:06:32,111 --> 01:06:33,910
not do it when you do it.
Right.

1476
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,440
And this is the thing about Jujitsu that
I always try to explain to people.

1477
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:43,420
Jujitsu practitioners are some of the
nicest people you'll ever meet and one

1478
01:06:43,421 --> 01:06:47,800
of the reasons why is they get all that
stupid shit out on the mats and they're

1479
01:06:47,801 --> 01:06:48,880
tired all the time too.

1480
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:51,100
So they're like,
they don't want to start any bullshit.

1481
01:06:51,101 --> 01:06:54,180
Like I don't want to deal.
And plus they don't need their egos

1482
01:06:54,181 --> 01:06:58,000
stroked their egos getting beaten down
and stroked all the time.

1483
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:01,900
Stroking and tap somebody beaten down
when you get tapped out and you have to

1484
01:07:01,901 --> 01:07:04,180
get used to it in order to get to a
certain rank.

1485
01:07:04,181 --> 01:07:06,100
Like if,
say if you get up to like purple belt or

1486
01:07:06,101 --> 01:07:08,290
Brown,
but with somebody who knows how many

1487
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:11,260
hundreds of times he'd been tapped out
and who knows,

1488
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:13,540
I have no idea how many times have been
tapped out,

1489
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:16,660
but it's probably thousands.
No Shit.

1490
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:18,250
How could it not be?
Wow.

1491
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:21,400
All those years of doing Jujitsu,
20 years of doing jude,

1492
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:25,140
20 plus years of doing Jujitsu and all
the times I rolled and the,

1493
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:26,650
all the times our role people better
than me.

1494
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:30,100
I've been fucking choked and arm barred
and you just get used to it.

1495
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,050
It's not fun.
You don't enjoy it,

1496
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:36,760
but what you do enjoy is that you've
experienced something that you didn't

1497
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:37,960
have an answer for.
And so,

1498
01:07:37,961 --> 01:07:39,910
you know,
there's work to be done and that's

1499
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,100
Jujitsu's endless.
It's endless.

1500
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:43,323
You know?
Um,

1501
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:48,400
there was a guy who explained this.
How has the explanation so far a

1502
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,990
brilliant Helson gracie explained it to
someone who didn't understand your

1503
01:07:51,991 --> 01:07:54,250
Jujitsu and he's got this thick
Brazilian accent.

1504
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:58,090
It's,
I do this and then you do that.

1505
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:00,490
And then I do this,
and then you do that.

1506
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:05,170
And then I do this for ever that's
Jujutsu.

1507
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:10,770
It's like it's constantly move and
defense and counter and defense and

1508
01:08:11,471 --> 01:08:13,300
attack.
When I hear people describe it as a

1509
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:14,950
chess match,
it is,

1510
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,180
but chess pieces

1511
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,180
only moved one way.

1512
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:21,450
It's so dynamic and kinetic.
And so they're always adding new moves

1513
01:08:21,451 --> 01:08:23,250
to.
There's all these new moves and people

1514
01:08:23,251 --> 01:08:24,630
are constantly learning.
Yeah,

1515
01:08:24,631 --> 01:08:25,261
it's,
it's,

1516
01:08:25,261 --> 01:08:28,950
um,
but the thing is you're using your body.

1517
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:33,480
Your body is what is being attacked and
your body's what you're using to attack.

1518
01:08:33,481 --> 01:08:34,590
So,
you know,

1519
01:08:34,591 --> 01:08:38,310
you see things give out while you're
attacking and things give out while

1520
01:08:38,311 --> 01:08:40,700
you're getting attacked.
And I think there's not enough to just

1521
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:42,090
two guys who,
um,

1522
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:47,600
I think if I was going to advise people,
one of the things that I would advise is

1523
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:53,490
you should have a regular conditioning
strength and conditioning routine just

1524
01:08:53,491 --> 01:08:55,990
to strengthen your joints,
strengthened your limb,

1525
01:08:55,991 --> 01:08:57,570
strengthen your back.
Yoga.

1526
01:08:57,571 --> 01:09:01,140
I think strength and conditioning and
yoga are almost as important,

1527
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:03,570
not as important as Jujitsu itself to
get good at it,

1528
01:09:03,571 --> 01:09:08,160
but almost as important to prevent
injuries and to allow you to reach your

1529
01:09:08,161 --> 01:09:09,330
full physical potential.

1530
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:11,370
[inaudible] yeah.
So I mean,

1531
01:09:11,371 --> 01:09:13,790
in terms of that being a life lesson,
it's um,

1532
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:18,680
I think when you can physicalize
something that then becomes like in a

1533
01:09:18,681 --> 01:09:23,681
workplace more of a mental thing,
you realize that being tapped out in the

1534
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:27,500
workplace can mean everybody gets fired
on a regular basis.

1535
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:30,530
People used to get one job and they
would keep it for 30 years.

1536
01:09:30,531 --> 01:09:34,370
You get a gold watch and a pension.
Now the average job,

1537
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:35,750
I don't know what it is,
Jamie,

1538
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:38,180
what's the average lifespan of a job?
Three years.

1539
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:42,230
Four years?
I think so I think people tend to bounce

1540
01:09:42,231 --> 01:09:44,900
around a lot more.
And so I think that life people get

1541
01:09:44,901 --> 01:09:47,570
divorced and they have it.
They have other successful

1542
01:09:47,571 --> 01:09:49,100
relationships,
you know,

1543
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,740
like somebody was saying,
we like today,

1544
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,910
like that joke,
the Henny youngman joke,

1545
01:09:52,911 --> 01:09:56,270
take my wife please.
It doesn't make sense anymore because

1546
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,240
you would have fucking left her.
You wouldn't be saying,

1547
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:00,890
take my wife,
you know,

1548
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:04,010
and so,
so I think that it's a life is filled,

1549
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,550
more transitions and being able to
accept and almost be,

1550
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,930
like you said,
learn from,

1551
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:13,130
be empowered and strengthened by a
change as opposed to defeated by it.

1552
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:15,380
Well,
no one gets through life perfect.

1553
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,560
You just don't.
So if you think other people are getting

1554
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:20,960
through life perfect and you're fucking
up all the time,

1555
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:23,010
you feel terrible about it.
Yeah,

1556
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,690
but you got to realize that those fuck
ups in those terrible moments,

1557
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:31,160
those are valuable learning experiences
and the people that I know that the most

1558
01:10:31,161 --> 01:10:35,690
interesting have failed the hardest.
They've had these colossal fuck ups and

1559
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:40,100
then they rebuilt themselves and then
understand it also gives you like a

1560
01:10:40,101 --> 01:10:44,060
certain amount of humility and
compassion for other people because you

1561
01:10:44,061 --> 01:10:45,380
know,
you've realized like,

1562
01:10:45,381 --> 01:10:48,410
Hey,
this is not like no one rides the wave

1563
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,513
forever.
Yeah,

1564
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:52,370
you crash,
you hit the coral gets scratched up.

1565
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,620
You get fucked up.
I've never served.

1566
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,800
I shouldn't use those analogies,
but you grow from it or you become evil

1567
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:01,930
from it.
We had.

1568
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,140
Well,
you could definitely can.

1569
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:04,880
Yeah,
you could definitely become evil from

1570
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:07,210
defeat.
But I just think um,

1571
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:10,250
I mean it's a fucked up thing.
I mean,

1572
01:11:10,251 --> 01:11:13,830
it's a weird thing to say,
but I really think we all collectively

1573
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:19,460
as a species need to emphasize and learn
how to be nicer to each other.

1574
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,920
Nobody teaches you that.
It's rare.

1575
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:26,760
They teach you in school,
be nice when you go to offices.

1576
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:27,600
There's,
you know,

1577
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:32,310
there's certain standards of behavior
that you're supposed to behave in,

1578
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:37,311
but there's not like
an emphasis on kindness and just being

1579
01:11:38,851 --> 01:11:43,800
friendly and I think that that doesn't
diminish competition.

1580
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,860
Like you can be friendly and kind to
people that you're competing with as

1581
01:11:46,861 --> 01:11:49,500
hard as you can.
That was also a thing that you find in

1582
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:52,620
Jujitsu guys who were just trying to
kill each other all the time or like

1583
01:11:52,621 --> 01:11:55,410
really close friends really close and
you know,

1584
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,090
very competitive.
Like motherfucker,

1585
01:11:57,091 --> 01:11:58,290
I'm getting you tonight.
No Bitch.

1586
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:00,720
You not like that kind of shit,
but friendly.

1587
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,190
Well,
because there's a safety,

1588
01:12:02,191 --> 01:12:06,060
because there's rules and in the
workplace the rules are much more

1589
01:12:06,061 --> 01:12:09,570
nebulous and what you do to get ahead,
kissing a bosses asked,

1590
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:12,780
sabotaging a project.
Is that part of competitive or is that

1591
01:12:12,781 --> 01:12:15,750
over the line?
Whereas with Jujitsu you'll get called

1592
01:12:15,751 --> 01:12:16,540
on a foul.

1593
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,340
Yeah.
Sabotaging a project.

1594
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,920
Imagine working with somebody and
they're sabotaging.

1595
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:24,310
When you're trying to accomplish now go
to the boss and talking shit behind your

1596
01:12:24,311 --> 01:12:27,460
back about your project and what you're
trying to achieve.

1597
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,700
That's one of the most soul sucking
things about jobs.

1598
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:38,170
The fakeness,
the the office banter,

1599
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:41,560
nonsense fakeness.
I just think as a,

1600
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,110
as a species,
just the human race,

1601
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:48,510
especially us as Americans because we
are so God damn competitive color,

1602
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,353
I'd be nicer.

1603
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:52,250
I think it starts with manners.
I think it starts with.

1604
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,120
I mean as a parent,
manners,

1605
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:59,300
they seem trivial,
but it creates the paradigm for Nice.

1606
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:03,540
Just thank you.
Please hold a door,

1607
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:06,630
donate like don't eat until everybody's
served their food.

1608
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:11,520
They're all little signals to people
that you care about them and respect

1609
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:15,120
them and I think it spills over and it
informs your other actions when you have

1610
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:16,020
good manners.
Right.

1611
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,530
Look,
people in the eye.

1612
01:13:17,531 --> 01:13:18,200
Yeah,

1613
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,100
yeah,
yeah.

1614
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:21,100
It'd be pulled.
And when people do that to you,

1615
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,770
you get a good feeling,
you know?

1616
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:23,620
Well,
you know,

1617
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:26,950
when someone holds open the door for you
or someone says thank you.

1618
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,580
Like I said hi to some guy.
The other day I was walking by him in

1619
01:13:30,581 --> 01:13:31,780
the hallway of the hotel.
I go,

1620
01:13:31,781 --> 01:13:36,280
how you doing man?
He just stared at me and immediately I

1621
01:13:36,281 --> 01:13:37,510
was like,
why?

1622
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,880
I was angry,
you know?

1623
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:41,770
Immediately like part of my instinct was
like,

1624
01:13:41,771 --> 01:13:43,010
fuck you man.
Yeah.

1625
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:45,250
Then part of me was like,
that poor bastard,

1626
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:47,170
you know?
And I went with that poor bastard.

1627
01:13:47,171 --> 01:13:47,710
Like,
oh,

1628
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:49,240
that's his life.
I just said Hi.

1629
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:50,900
I'm just trying to be nice.
Yeah.

1630
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:53,170
But he looked,
looked at me like I was almost like I

1631
01:13:53,171 --> 01:13:55,450
was weak and saying hi to them.
Right.

1632
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,440
You know,

1633
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:00,310
I was raised to like,
like if I see somebody with bags,

1634
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:03,070
I helped them.
And it makes me feel fucking great.

1635
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,900
It feels good to help people.
Yeah.

1636
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:08,980
I think I was raised and that's the
thing about being raised Catholic

1637
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,930
because I was raised.
Were you raised Catholic?

1638
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:12,100
I was raised Catholic

1639
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,590
too.
First grade after first grade we kind of

1640
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:17,130
abandoned it,
but even up until then it's,

1641
01:14:17,131 --> 01:14:17,760
it,
it's,

1642
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,730
it gives you a lot of,
um,

1643
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:23,320
it's a life of service.
It's very much about helping people.

1644
01:14:23,321 --> 01:14:24,550
It's very much she,
you know,

1645
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,350
he could say what you want about the
Catholics,

1646
01:14:26,351 --> 01:14:28,090
but you know,
they were in the trenches and a lot of

1647
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:30,260
third world countries,
nuns and,

1648
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:31,271
you know,
they,

1649
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:32,890
they,
they did a lot of good.

1650
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:35,080
And uh,
and I think that rubbed off on me.

1651
01:14:35,081 --> 01:14:37,990
My parents both always did a lot of
charity work.

1652
01:14:37,991 --> 01:14:40,620
I do a lot of charity work with my kids
and you know,

1653
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:43,510
that's going to stay with them.
I think we throw the baby out with the

1654
01:14:43,511 --> 01:14:47,770
bathwater when it comes to religion and
even just rigid ideologies.

1655
01:14:47,771 --> 01:14:50,230
I think there's,
there's something about religion that

1656
01:14:50,231 --> 01:14:52,120
can absolutely help some people.

1657
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,280
And there's aspects of it that are very
beneficial.

1658
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,590
Having that code to live by,
you know,

1659
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:59,620
even if it's because of the fucking
spaghetti monster in the sky,

1660
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:03,310
like whatever it is that you believe,
but if you really act that,

1661
01:15:03,311 --> 01:15:05,650
that thing,
act like that thing is watching over you

1662
01:15:05,651 --> 01:15:08,050
and that there's codes and tenants that
you have to live by,

1663
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,960
like most of the tenants of
Christianity,

1664
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:13,840
if you look at them,
if you really follow Jesus has rule,

1665
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:16,060
which most people don't,
but if you really did,

1666
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:17,680
you'd be doing a lot of great work.
You know,

1667
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:20,350
you'd be helping people.
You'd be treating each other as if they

1668
01:15:20,351 --> 01:15:22,840
were your brothers and sisters.
The neediest.

1669
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:25,510
I mean,
that's who Jesus helped the beggars in

1670
01:15:25,511 --> 01:15:27,640
the street and the prostitutes and you
know,

1671
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:30,010
that was some hardcore shit he was doing
back then.

1672
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:32,140
And um,
yeah,

1673
01:15:32,141 --> 01:15:35,470
I think it's like the 10 commandments
you can live by,

1674
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:36,363
I don't know,
eight of them.

1675
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,350
Eight of them are pretty good to live
by.

1676
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:40,750
I'm still gonna cover.
My neighbor's wife Covet.

1677
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:42,880
She's fucking hot.
Do you know what that was about?

1678
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:45,510
It wasn't about that.
What was it about your neighbors?

1679
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:49,870
She was possession.
She was covet like she was a possession

1680
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:52,300
of the neighbor.
Like she.

1681
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:53,410
He owned her.
Right?

1682
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,370
Oh,
that's right.

1683
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,860
Yeah,
and the same thing stood for the

1684
01:15:56,861 --> 01:15:59,140
commandment.
If you really read it says,

1685
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,900
do not covet thy neighbor's wife or they
neighbor,

1686
01:16:02,901 --> 01:16:05,380
slave,
slave,

1687
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:07,780
slave.
It's a donkey.

1688
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,060
I think it's donkey enslave.
Really?

1689
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:11,080
Yup.
Wow.

1690
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,180
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1691
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:13,203
Yeah.
Don't,

1692
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,790
don't try to steal their slave.
You can keep slaves.

1693
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:20,800
Just walk them from your neighbor.
It's just so obvious that what they were

1694
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:25,861
talking about back then was all wrapped
around the way people thought about

1695
01:16:26,771 --> 01:16:28,000
things.
Then yeah,

1696
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:30,280
you know,
but they knew even then,

1697
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:33,400
even thousands of years ago,
they knew there's a right way to do

1698
01:16:33,401 --> 01:16:34,780
things and there's a wrong way to do
things.

1699
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:37,180
There's,
when you pick up the people's bags,

1700
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:39,790
you feel good.
Let's tell kids that.

1701
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,130
Let's teach people that you pick up the
bags,

1702
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:44,140
you feel good.
You hold the door open,

1703
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:45,880
you feel good.
You help someone.

1704
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:46,870
You feel good.
Like,

1705
01:16:46,871 --> 01:16:47,704
okay,
let's.

1706
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:50,620
This is obviously we all want to feel
good,

1707
01:16:50,621 --> 01:16:53,170
right?
How do we feel like there's moments in

1708
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:56,800
my life where I feel terrible where I've
done something wrong or a fucked up

1709
01:16:56,801 --> 01:17:01,801
something or just failed and I just feel
terrible and I always think when I do

1710
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,490
have that feeling of,
Oh God,

1711
01:17:03,491 --> 01:17:05,980
I fucking hate this feeling.
Why can't I feel great?

1712
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,200
Why can't I just feel awesome right now?
Well,

1713
01:17:08,201 --> 01:17:10,070
because it didn't go and this is

1714
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,970
like the psychic reminder.
This is that jolt of energy that's

1715
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:14,960
letting you know like,
hey,

1716
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:19,430
you went on a wrong path.
You fucked up you tank this,

1717
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:23,780
you crashed that you did wrong.
Like you're supposed to feel like shit.

1718
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:25,730
Right?
So that you don't do it again.

1719
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,320
Yeah.
But conversely,

1720
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,740
when something good happens,
when you help someone,

1721
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:33,800
when someone can't get their bag in the
overhead because it's too heavy and you

1722
01:17:33,801 --> 01:17:36,200
help them and you hand it to them,
they smile at you and you smile at them.

1723
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,090
You walk off the plane,
you feel good,

1724
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:41,150
you feel good.
You've got to teach that to like,

1725
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:43,040
you have to remember that and you have
to go,

1726
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:44,170
why do I feel so good?
Oh,

1727
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,770
I felt so good because it helped that
lady.

1728
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:46,340
Yeah.
You know,

1729
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:49,850
I felt so good because I said hi to that
guy and like I say hi me back and we

1730
01:17:49,851 --> 01:17:51,500
looked at each other and go,
you know,

1731
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:53,120
made some niceties or whatever.

1732
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,260
Yeah.
And that's,

1733
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:59,240
that's part of the joy of life is those
friendly,

1734
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:02,240
fun,
Nice interactions with people.

1735
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:06,080
But when you got your shit in order,
it's easier to have those experiences

1736
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:07,970
when you don't.
My personal experience,

1737
01:18:07,971 --> 01:18:11,040
when I don't have my shit in order and
I've made mistakes and I'm,

1738
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:15,020
I fucked something up.
It's very hard for me to enjoy anything.

1739
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:17,150
Yeah.
I just go through the motions.

1740
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,020
I just,
I feel like,

1741
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:21,080
Oh,
if I have something that I fucked up and

1742
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:24,800
then I have that terrible feeling,
but I have to hang out with my family

1743
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:26,720
and my kids.
I just ride it out.

1744
01:18:26,721 --> 01:18:29,780
I just have to ride it out.
I try to be real friendly and real

1745
01:18:29,781 --> 01:18:31,580
sweet,
but I don't feel good inside.

1746
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:33,350
I feel terrible and I go,
well,

1747
01:18:33,351 --> 01:18:35,420
this is going to go away with
contemplation,

1748
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,370
with understanding.
It's going to.

1749
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,040
This feeling is gonna go away,
but you got to ride it out.

1750
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,200
You know,
and I know I can ride it out because

1751
01:18:42,201 --> 01:18:43,820
I've read it out,
wrote it out before,

1752
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:45,650
but for some people,
man,

1753
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:49,130
they don't know what to do there.
Don't they don't know what that feeling

1754
01:18:49,131 --> 01:18:50,960
is.
They feel like this is their life and

1755
01:18:50,961 --> 01:18:53,210
then that feeling,
if you don't conquer it,

1756
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,370
you get comfortable with it.
You get used to it.

1757
01:18:55,371 --> 01:18:57,980
You used to failing,
you get used to that terrible feeling

1758
01:18:57,981 --> 01:19:02,430
and then you start pouring booze on that
terrible feeling or pouring drugs or.

1759
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,920
Well,
it also becomes like A.

1760
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:07,800
I was in therapy and I remember the
therapist told me that you,

1761
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:12,810
we all have a narrative of our lives and
you can choose that narrative.

1762
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:15,960
It's that fucking simple.
That's basically what behavioral therapy

1763
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:20,961
tells you is that it's all a projection.
Everything in your life as a projection.

1764
01:19:21,871 --> 01:19:22,710
You know,
you say,

1765
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:26,130
I have these attributes,
I've accomplished these things.

1766
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:29,970
Or you can say,
I lacked these things and I fucked up

1767
01:19:29,971 --> 01:19:34,500
these things and you can live your life
putting that energy out to people and

1768
01:19:34,501 --> 01:19:39,120
it's as simple as just literally sitting
down and thinking about how you want to

1769
01:19:39,121 --> 01:19:43,680
see yourself and just keep,
keep reminding yourself of that and

1770
01:19:43,681 --> 01:19:44,700
you'll start to live.
And I mean,

1771
01:19:44,701 --> 01:19:47,700
this sounds so fucking hokey to
oversimplified,

1772
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:49,200
but it's real,
but it's real,

1773
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:50,530
you know,
and,

1774
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:55,200
and part of the thing,
the downside of religion is that I was

1775
01:19:55,201 --> 01:19:58,830
raised with a lot of shame and guilt.
And so those periods you're talking

1776
01:19:58,831 --> 01:20:01,800
about where you fucked up and you're
feeling bad and you got to ride it out.

1777
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:06,420
You throw shame on top of that and it
extends it and it makes it more

1778
01:20:06,421 --> 01:20:10,950
profound.
And it's not just about your action and

1779
01:20:10,951 --> 01:20:15,210
how it might have affected other people.
It's about original sin,

1780
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:16,860
you know,
heavy,

1781
01:20:16,861 --> 01:20:19,170
original sin shed,
Garden of Eden,

1782
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:20,880
where evil,
you know,

1783
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,680
we're dirty.
We need to confess,

1784
01:20:22,681 --> 01:20:26,070
we need to be cleansed,
throw all that on top of a simple

1785
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:26,970
mistake.
And again,

1786
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:27,780
it makes it complex.

1787
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,310
Okay?
Yeah Man,

1788
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:34,020
the sin.
And the pain and the suffering that mean

1789
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:36,150
island went through one year of Catholic
school,

1790
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:38,400
but that one year when I was six years
old,

1791
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:39,450
first grade,
I was like,

1792
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:42,060
this is ridiculous.
These people are crazy.

1793
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:43,380
Yeah.
I'm not this bad.

1794
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:48,530
I just knew that my parents got split up
when I was five and then I was really

1795
01:20:49,831 --> 01:20:50,790
confused.
I was like,

1796
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:53,370
I can't believe my mom and dad aren't
together anymore.

1797
01:20:53,371 --> 01:20:56,250
And there was screaming and hitting and
a lot of violence.

1798
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:59,910
And it was just,
it was good that my mom got out because

1799
01:20:59,911 --> 01:21:02,370
I learned that when something is
terrible,

1800
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:06,180
like you don't just stay and get smacked
around you leave.

1801
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:11,720
But the bad thing was it just through my
whole life into chaos and I wanted some

1802
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:17,520
order and things.
And one of the things that I turned to

1803
01:21:17,521 --> 01:21:19,440
for order was religion.

1804
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:21,510
Even though it's five,
six years old,

1805
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:24,520
like I remember my grandparents or you
know,

1806
01:21:24,570 --> 01:21:26,580
whoever was taking me to church,
like I got into it.

1807
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:28,470
I was like,
this is the answer.

1808
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:30,540
Like it's like what?
What does God want you to do?

1809
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,970
Because when you're six,
like it's,

1810
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:36,580
it's not a con.
I remember thinking of it and there's a

1811
01:21:36,581 --> 01:21:41,010
very narrow confined way,
like I didn't have a broad sense of the

1812
01:21:41,011 --> 01:21:43,590
world.
I had a sense of God as being like the

1813
01:21:43,591 --> 01:21:45,390
ultimate dad.
Right?

1814
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:46,220
And then will the,
well,

1815
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:49,830
this data that I have is failed.
So there's ultimate dad.

1816
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:52,110
You've got to do what he says and that's
how you,

1817
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:53,700
that's how life works.
Good.

1818
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:57,840
And that's how you're happy.
This very small vocabulary that I have

1819
01:21:57,841 --> 01:22:01,210
this narrow view of the world with,
you know,

1820
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:05,580
five summers of life experience.
And then I went to Catholic school and I

1821
01:22:05,581 --> 01:22:07,350
was like,
Holy Shit,

1822
01:22:07,351 --> 01:22:08,184
is this wrong?

1823
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,960
I was like,
this is so wrong.

1824
01:22:09,961 --> 01:22:14,550
Sister Mary Josephine.
This is the only person I remember from

1825
01:22:14,551 --> 01:22:16,770
being six years old.
I don't remember anybody's name,

1826
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:19,920
but I remember that fucking evil monster
of a lady.

1827
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,860
She was horrible.
And I remember thinking,

1828
01:22:22,861 --> 01:22:27,420
she smelled like death.
She looked like how she just looked like

1829
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:32,780
she was just in grief and anger and just
annoyed all the time and was so mean to

1830
01:22:34,831 --> 01:22:36,570
kids bat.
And uh,

1831
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:38,430
it,
it fucking knocked it right out of me,

1832
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:42,660
knocked it all right out of me,
all my ideas about religion and

1833
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:46,530
Catholicism.
And I was done by the time first grade

1834
01:22:46,531 --> 01:22:47,311
was over.
I was like,

1835
01:22:47,311 --> 01:22:49,650
there's no way I'm going back.
When my parents had run away.

1836
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:50,530
Wow.
I was like,

1837
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:51,363
there's no fucking.

1838
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,590
Yeah.
My parents went to Catholic schools in

1839
01:22:54,591 --> 01:22:57,830
the Bronx back when they just hit you.
I mean,

1840
01:22:58,110 --> 01:22:59,960
like every infraction,
they had a room,

1841
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:03,500
literally they had the ruler out and
they wrap you on the knuckles all the

1842
01:23:03,501 --> 01:23:05,860
time.
And My mother said to me,

1843
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:09,700
she realized she got older,
these nuns that were teaching very often

1844
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:13,720
they became nuns because maybe they were
lesbians,

1845
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:17,050
maybe they hated kids.
They didn't want to go down that road.

1846
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:21,970
And so they joined the sisterhood to get
away from it and they stuck him in

1847
01:23:21,971 --> 01:23:26,971
fucking classrooms with 25 jacked up
testosterone written kids.

1848
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,540
And it's their worst nightmare.
That's why they're so miserable.

1849
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:35,890
We got a kid in the neighborhood that
became a priest and he was a nice kid.

1850
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,140
I was in high school.
What?

1851
01:23:37,141 --> 01:23:39,450
He's gay as fuck.
Everybody knows gay as fuck.

1852
01:23:39,451 --> 01:23:42,900
It was so obvious.
He was just soft and this,

1853
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:47,410
his face was soft and,
and he had no interest in women who's

1854
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:47,910
like,
wow,

1855
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:51,360
there's gotta be a way.
And he went right into the priesthood.

1856
01:23:51,361 --> 01:23:53,790
We were,
we started calling him father by the

1857
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:55,920
time he was 17.
Wow.

1858
01:23:55,950 --> 01:23:58,890
I guess he was 18.
He was like a year older than us,

1859
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,930
maybe two years older than me.
Um,

1860
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:06,440
and I think he had graduated and he was
already like going into the priesthood.

1861
01:24:06,781 --> 01:24:08,490
Right.
I don't know what steps you have to take

1862
01:24:08,491 --> 01:24:09,750
to do it,
but people started calling.

1863
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:13,860
Father started calling him father when I
was 16.

1864
01:24:13,861 --> 01:24:16,440
I think people are doing it,
but I remember thinking like,

1865
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:17,490
oh,
he's gay,

1866
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:20,340
obviously he's gay.
And now he's like,

1867
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:25,520
what are the options and fucking Newton,
Massachusetts in 1983.

1868
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,210
That's going to do.
Yeah.

1869
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:29,630
What's it going to do?
You know,

1870
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:32,700
didn't know where to go.
Became a fucking priest.

1871
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:37,740
Do you think that priests in a rectory,
which Latin derivative rectum visit now,

1872
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:45,850
do you think they're all fucking.
I mean the precert mostly gay,

1873
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:48,700
they're not getting laid there.
They've got what,

1874
01:24:48,701 --> 01:24:52,420
23 hours of downtime every day when
they're not doing a to an a mass.

1875
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:56,770
I want to know what percentage of them
are pedophiles and what percentage of

1876
01:24:56,771 --> 01:25:00,010
them were molested.
So became pedophiles.

1877
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,053
It's,
I mean,

1878
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:04,090
and people to get upset of this look,
you can't get upset at it.

1879
01:25:04,091 --> 01:25:06,130
It's like blowing tires on Nascar.
It's real.

1880
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:06,810
Yeah.
Okay.

1881
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,560
We'll.
Tarzan don't always fail.

1882
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:09,910
You're right.
They don't always fail,

1883
01:25:09,911 --> 01:25:12,190
but they fail a lot.
A lot of people lose tires.

1884
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:14,050
You know,
a lot of people crash cars.

1885
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:19,080
It's just your,
there's a giant history of sex offenders

1886
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:23,440
that become priests and molest kids.
Like what are the,

1887
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,130
what are the numbers like if yet is it
10 percent?

1888
01:25:27,131 --> 01:25:29,530
And we just hearing about.
I mean if it was 10 percent of priests

1889
01:25:29,531 --> 01:25:30,970
is still a lot of people getting
molested,

1890
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,550
is it 30 percent?
Was the number.

1891
01:25:33,551 --> 01:25:34,384
It's not zero.

1892
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:36,520
Well,
what's disturbing isn't just that

1893
01:25:36,521 --> 01:25:38,860
number,
but the number of priests that know

1894
01:25:38,861 --> 01:25:43,210
about it that don't say anything or then
they even know about it and they shift

1895
01:25:43,211 --> 01:25:46,300
them to another church.
I mean the complicity of the church in

1896
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:49,240
dealing with this problem.
It's a civil case.

1897
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:51,490
This is rape,
this should be in the courts.

1898
01:25:51,491 --> 01:25:55,450
Police should be brought to the church
and they should be fingerprinted and put

1899
01:25:55,451 --> 01:25:58,360
in jail,
but instead we somehow say,

1900
01:25:58,361 --> 01:26:00,550
you guys deal with it yourself.
Yeah.

1901
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:04,010
Yeah.
You remember when Ratzinger had to

1902
01:26:04,011 --> 01:26:05,390
leave?
He had a quick,

1903
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:08,540
which is very rare,
but it was because they wanted to try

1904
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:10,930
him for crimes against humanity like
that.

1905
01:26:10,931 --> 01:26:15,350
I was a fucking piece of shit.
What he did was take priests that were

1906
01:26:15,351 --> 01:26:18,950
molesting kids.
It just move him and he moved this one

1907
01:26:18,951 --> 01:26:20,870
priest,
this the guy that became pope,

1908
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:21,704
right?
Yes.

1909
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:25,670
He was in charge.
He was a cardinal or whatever the fuck

1910
01:26:25,671 --> 01:26:27,200
he was.
Whatever the name is.

1911
01:26:27,201 --> 01:26:30,620
Were you in Germany?
Take these priests and move them to this

1912
01:26:30,621 --> 01:26:35,621
new spot and I think it was in Arizona
or New Mexico.

1913
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,910
I forget where it was.
It was somewhere in the United States.

1914
01:26:37,911 --> 01:26:40,540
I believe he moved this guy.
We're like,

1915
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:41,600
well,
send him over there.

1916
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:44,870
And the guy wound up raping 100 deaf
kids.

1917
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:47,900
Christ.
Yeah.

1918
01:26:47,901 --> 01:26:49,850
What you hear about that and you're
like,

1919
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:52,880
oh my God.
He imagine your baby,

1920
01:26:52,881 --> 01:26:57,170
your poor baby you can't hear and they
go to this place and they can't hear

1921
01:26:57,171 --> 01:27:00,760
anything and this priest sticking his
dick in their ass and then her mouth and

1922
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:05,000
like now like this is God does God wants
this.

1923
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:06,740
God wants this guy to do this to me.

1924
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,560
And if there was a company where the CEO
allow that to happen under his watch,

1925
01:27:11,561 --> 01:27:15,460
nevermind facilitated it.
If you were the head of the company and

1926
01:27:15,461 --> 01:27:17,560
it happened,
you would have to step down.

1927
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:20,080
Oh yeah,
this guy got elevated.

1928
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:23,080
Pope
crazy.

1929
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:25,270
Well,
they did it that way for so long.

1930
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:27,850
I mean there's so many digital or you
ever see,

1931
01:27:27,851 --> 01:27:29,980
hear no evil.
It's a documentary about it.

1932
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,440
Now.
I can't watch those.

1933
01:27:32,441 --> 01:27:33,850
Documentaries are rough,
man,

1934
01:27:33,851 --> 01:27:35,440
there's,
there's quite a few of them and I

1935
01:27:35,441 --> 01:27:39,520
usually make it like 45 minutes into
them where I'm just crying and I can

1936
01:27:39,521 --> 01:27:40,530
handle it.
Yeah.

1937
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:42,760
It's just.
And here's the thing.

1938
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:47,140
Most of those guys who were perpetrators
were victims at one point in their

1939
01:27:47,141 --> 01:27:47,980
lives.
Of course,

1940
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:53,020
90 percent I would say fucking crazy.
What had horrible,

1941
01:27:53,021 --> 01:27:55,260
horrible system of,
you know,

1942
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,650
not a system,
but you know,

1943
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:59,140
repeating action in there.

1944
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:02,880
And that's the thing about
that,

1945
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,830
the way it spreads,
you know,

1946
01:28:04,831 --> 01:28:08,100
every time somebody molested they,
you're creating,

1947
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:09,930
you're creating other predators.

1948
01:28:10,030 --> 01:28:11,650
No,
no.

1949
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,810
Oh,
so crazy.

1950
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,190
Yeah,
I don't.

1951
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:22,630
We went,
we went to a pretty cool church growing

1952
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:26,470
up and the priests were apparently,
I found out later were all having

1953
01:28:26,471 --> 01:28:28,990
affairs with women in town.
Really?

1954
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:30,580
Yeah.
This one guy,

1955
01:28:30,581 --> 01:28:31,980
I won't say his name,
say it.

1956
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,450
Father Mcdonough,
that piece of shit.

1957
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:39,940
Not fucking a kid right now that are way
better.

1958
01:28:39,941 --> 01:28:41,230
That's the whole problem.
Bang.

1959
01:28:41,231 --> 01:28:43,060
And people's wives,
you know,

1960
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:45,380
like we like eucharistic ministers,
you know,

1961
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:48,280
like the eucharistic ministers are the
people that go to church,

1962
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:50,650
but they're,
they're so special that they can

1963
01:28:50,651 --> 01:28:55,150
actually go give communion to people
that are home homebound.

1964
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:57,320
Oh.

1965
01:28:57,410 --> 01:28:59,510
So the pre,
they were in the inner circle and the

1966
01:28:59,511 --> 01:29:00,150
priest,

1967
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:02,790
I have a little fair.
So he would go over,

1968
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:05,730
like maybe grandma was bedridden.
He'd go over,

1969
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:08,070
give her the service,
then slip it to the daughter.

1970
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:16,190
How's call?
No,

1971
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:17,123
that's not what he did.

1972
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,600
It was like the people that were the
ministers,

1973
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:23,770
they became close to the priest because
they would have to go to him to get the,

1974
01:29:23,771 --> 01:29:25,630
uh,
the bread blessed.

1975
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:29,590
And then they will take it in like a
takeout bag and they would deliver it to

1976
01:29:29,591 --> 01:29:30,690
the people that were,
um,

1977
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:32,690
homeboy bedridden.
Yeah,

1978
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,150
yeah,
yeah.

1979
01:29:34,151 --> 01:29:35,340
I mean,
they,

1980
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:40,410
those religions become so ingrained in
people's behavior patterns that mean it

1981
01:29:41,531 --> 01:29:43,520
becomes a part of the community.
You can't be like,

1982
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:44,940
I'm fucking quit in the church.
Like,

1983
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:46,000
what are you talking about,
bobby?

1984
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:46,630
Yeah,
right.

1985
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:48,490
We go to church on Sunday.
The whole family goes,

1986
01:29:48,491 --> 01:29:51,100
we got up on a Sunday,
best on we'd go to church.

1987
01:29:51,830 --> 01:29:55,510
He becomes a part of your,
not just your life,

1988
01:29:55,511 --> 01:29:59,380
but the way you socially interact with
your friends and your loved ones.

1989
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:01,960
Get everybody together.
It's like it's part of the Sunday

1990
01:30:01,961 --> 01:30:02,610
bonding.

1991
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:04,830
Oh,
in your child being christened and

1992
01:30:04,831 --> 01:30:08,160
getting their first communion.
These are big like landmark moments in

1993
01:30:08,161 --> 01:30:09,300
your kid's life.
You know,

1994
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:12,870
if you think about it,
like you get your communion around the

1995
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:14,700
time that you begin puberty,
you know,

1996
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:17,040
they're all based on cycles of nature.
You know,

1997
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:19,080
Jesus was born,
uh,

1998
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,720
in reality in April,
but according to the church,

1999
01:30:21,721 --> 01:30:24,990
December 25th,
which is right at the winter solstice

2000
01:30:24,991 --> 01:30:26,580
when the north star,
it's like,

2001
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:30,380
it's all built into nature.
It's all pagan and its origins and all

2002
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,720
the ceremonies that you go through are
tied into,

2003
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:36,210
you know,
rites of passage and people's lives.

2004
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:40,290
That's why it's so weird that like when
they were trying to convert pagans

2005
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:42,510
during the Roman days,
the,

2006
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,291
they're like,
wow,

2007
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:44,650
you know,
we do this thing,

2008
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:46,920
the winter solstice.
It's like what a coincidence,

2009
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:51,360
a Jesus was born the same time and come
on board,

2010
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:52,120
come on board.

2011
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:54,860
Most of the pagan gods and,
and,

2012
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:59,050
and most of the world religions,
the Messiah was born during the winter

2013
01:30:59,051 --> 01:31:03,280
solstice and there was a and many of
them died and rose up in the,

2014
01:31:03,281 --> 01:31:04,750
uh,
in the spring,

2015
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:08,140
which is what the vernal equinox right
around Easter always lands right around

2016
01:31:08,141 --> 01:31:08,980
the vernal equinox.

2017
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,640
Well,
you got to think for those people back

2018
01:31:10,641 --> 01:31:13,010
then,
like everything was about the crops

2019
01:31:13,011 --> 01:31:17,270
rising and gathering food and fertility
and that was everything.

2020
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:19,400
Yeah.
Everything was about whether or not you

2021
01:31:19,401 --> 01:31:22,250
could make a baby whether or not you
could feed your family.

2022
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:24,200
I mean,
if the crops went bad,

2023
01:31:24,201 --> 01:31:26,930
you had a late frost or something like
that and things died.

2024
01:31:26,931 --> 01:31:28,250
You were fucked.
Yeah.

2025
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:32,870
Especially since you had 12 kids.
No birth control shoot loads all willy

2026
01:31:32,871 --> 01:31:35,780
nilly.
Yeah.

2027
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:36,860
Yeah.
And you know,

2028
01:31:36,861 --> 01:31:38,780
and it was a,
it was a sin for a woman to say,

2029
01:31:38,781 --> 01:31:40,790
now you had to do it.
I mean,

2030
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:42,530
you look at you really.
I'll fuck.

2031
01:31:42,531 --> 01:31:43,700
Yeah.
With the Catholic church,

2032
01:31:43,701 --> 01:31:45,140
you can't say no to your husband.

2033
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:46,580
Really?
No Way,

2034
01:31:46,581 --> 01:31:48,290
man.
It's a crime to sin.

2035
01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:51,870
You can go to the priest and complain
about it on the priests.

2036
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,240
Go give up the posts.
That's right.

2037
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:54,740
Well,
yeah.

2038
01:31:56,230 --> 01:31:57,680
No,
no birth control either.

2039
01:31:57,710 --> 01:32:00,030
That's the other thing that's crazy.
Like,

2040
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,120
hey,
you don't.

2041
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,230
Well,
you got to create Christian soldiers.

2042
01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:05,920
That's what.
That's where these rules came from is

2043
01:32:05,921 --> 01:32:10,921
that it was about populating with his
many of our guys as possible so they

2044
01:32:11,621 --> 01:32:14,250
don't want to limit you having kids.
Well,

2045
01:32:14,251 --> 01:32:17,680
there was no birth control at the time.
I mean back when that was all going on,

2046
01:32:17,681 --> 01:32:21,100
but you can pull out and come in and
girls face legally

2047
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:29,090
it's mandatory and so when you think
about like birth control today,

2048
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:33,190
I think it's great that people have the
option for birth control 100 percent and

2049
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:35,070
I'm not anti birth control.
I think it's amazing,

2050
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:40,640
but it's very weird for a girl to have
hormones in her body that are

2051
01:32:42,871 --> 01:32:45,480
artificially put in there,
that tricker body into thinking it's

2052
01:32:45,481 --> 01:32:46,314
pregnant.
Yeah.

2053
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:49,230
And they go through this whole cycle of
it and what's really fascinating is

2054
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:54,330
women lose their ability to discern
certain smells that they get from men,

2055
01:32:54,331 --> 01:32:57,720
whether or not a man is compatible,
like they've done these studies where

2056
01:32:57,721 --> 01:33:00,360
they took women on birth control and off
birth control,

2057
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:05,370
and they could smell men's clothes like
a woman off birth control can smell a

2058
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:07,350
man's clothes,
just know anything about them and can.

2059
01:33:07,351 --> 01:33:11,840
This can discern whether or not she'd be
attracted to him certain days.

2060
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:13,640
Certain degree of success.
Yeah,

2061
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:15,540
but that's out the window.
As soon as they're on the pill,

2062
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:16,770
when they're on the pill,
they just.

2063
01:33:16,771 --> 01:33:18,870
Their bodies all confused.
They're pregnant and they're not

2064
01:33:18,871 --> 01:33:22,530
thinking about that.
And so they lose this sort of weird

2065
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,990
sense of compatibility.

2066
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,680
Wow.
Yeah.

2067
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:28,980
This was.
They start responding only to axe body

2068
01:33:28,981 --> 01:33:30,450
spray,
smell dating.

2069
01:33:30,451 --> 01:33:32,400
What is this the first time?
Yeah,

2070

Wow.
I'll tell you what,

2081
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:09,460
my wife,
I remember like the first date I had

2082
01:34:09,461 --> 01:34:11,200
with my wife,
we rode.

2083
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:14,920
We rode our bikes over the Brooklyn
Bridge and we.

2084
01:34:14,921 --> 01:34:16,720
It was,
it was a hot summer day and then we

2085
01:34:16,721 --> 01:34:21,721
fooled around a little bit and I
remember smelling her and fucking being

2086
01:34:22,121 --> 01:34:27,121
so aroused.
It was like to this day her smell turns

2087
01:34:28,661 --> 01:34:29,920
me on.
Yeah.

2088
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:32,440
People are compatible with each other
and in smells.

2089
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:34,120
It's real.
That's legit.

2090
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:37,180
It's a very strange thing though,
right?

2091
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,100
We'll look at every.
Every fucking animal.

2092
01:34:40,101 --> 01:34:45,101
Smells actually watched this planet
earth a special and it was about a,

2093
01:34:47,771 --> 01:34:49,960
I forget which kind of wild cat it was,
but they go,

2094
01:34:49,961 --> 01:34:54,961
they travel for like hundreds of miles
and there's certain rocks that they know

2095
01:34:55,271 --> 01:34:58,040
to rub their backs up against and leave
an odor

2096
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:02,660
and the other one's in the territory go
to that same rock and they smell it and

2097
01:35:02,661 --> 01:35:06,980
they rub on it and then they decide who
to mate with based on these,

2098
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:10,880
like a specific tree or a rock that are
like miles away from each other.

2099
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,970
Wow.
Wow.

2100
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:14,533
Huh.

2101
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:17,120
That's crazy.
It's really crazy.

2102
01:35:17,121 --> 01:35:20,750
When you think about how an animal has a
sense,

2103
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:25,840
like their sense of smell is like almost
like we don't have a sense of smell,

2104
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:29,330
like what they can.
They can smell fear and adrenaline.

2105
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:31,820
They can.
They can smell all kinds of weird shit.

2106
01:35:31,821 --> 01:35:34,610
They can smell animals from hundreds of
yards away.

2107
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:40,030
The wind blows up like they can smell
shit that we don't have a goddamn chance

2108
01:35:40,971 --> 01:35:42,320
of smelling.
There's no way.

2109
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:46,880
Smelling is so fucking weird.
I was in my car on the 10 freeway the

2110
01:35:46,881 --> 01:35:49,700
other day and there was a small fire on
the west side.

2111
01:35:49,701 --> 01:35:54,701
I was seven miles away,
windows up and I could smell smoke and

2112
01:35:55,311 --> 01:35:59,930
you really think about physically,
how the fuck did that sent traveled that

2113
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:02,960
far through my car and into my nose.
What?

2114
01:36:02,961 --> 01:36:04,310
What's crazy?
Skunks.

2115
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:05,330
Yeah,
right.

2116
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:10,330
They say skunks give you a sense of how
an animal smells because the parts per

2117
01:36:10,401 --> 01:36:15,110
million of skunk smell that you can pick
up is a lot like how a dog could pick up

2118
01:36:15,111 --> 01:36:16,460
the smell of like a robber.

2119
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:18,530
When they give a dog a t shirt,
like there he goes,

2120
01:36:18,531 --> 01:36:19,364
go get them,
boy.

2121
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:24,170
And they run around like that.
That's apparently very similar.

2122
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:26,330
Very similar.
Like when you smell a skunk,

2123
01:36:26,331 --> 01:36:27,650
like you could smell skunk and you're
like,

2124
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:28,670
oh,
it's over to the right.

2125
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:32,120
Like you know where it is so weird.
Like you could be on the street.

2126
01:36:32,121 --> 01:36:32,990
You're like,
oh,

2127
01:36:32,991 --> 01:36:35,090
you're fucking smell that.
And you'd go like that to the left.

2128
01:36:35,091 --> 01:36:36,320
You go like that to the right and you're
like,

2129
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:37,190
oh,
it's over this way.

2130
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,760
You can.
You could smell skunk from blocks away,

2131
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:42,140
blocks,
I mean,

2132
01:36:42,141 --> 01:36:45,800
imagine a smell that you could smell
from blocks away and it comes out of an

2133
01:36:45,801 --> 01:36:47,420
animal the size of a football.
Yeah,

2134
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:48,890
that's crazy.
All right.

2135
01:36:49,110 --> 01:36:51,440
It's not a lot of sense.
This is a little bit of a spray.

2136
01:36:51,441 --> 01:36:55,100
That's like if you took a hairspray can
and just held it down for two seconds.

2137
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:57,590
Like Shit.
That's what a skunk sprays.

2138
01:36:57,591 --> 01:36:58,610
Yeah.
I get it.

2139
01:36:58,611 --> 01:36:59,690
Sprayed once.
Did you?

2140
01:36:59,710 --> 01:37:01,240
Yeah.
We were in Newport,

2141
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:03,530
Rhode Island.
We had this house and it was,

2142
01:37:03,531 --> 01:37:05,750
it was a converted,
a horse stable.

2143
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:07,610
So there was just a,
it was,

2144
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:12,410
it was 21 of us living in the house one
summer and there were people literally

2145
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:17,590
they were stables that had cots in them
and people slept in those.

2146
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:20,840
And I think there was like three
bathrooms in the entire place.

2147
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:22,440
And so,
uh,

2148
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:26,960
there were skunks,
skunks that lived in the basement of the

2149
01:37:26,961 --> 01:37:30,260
house and the house just smelled like
skunks.

2150
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,990
And then one night I hear this clunking
out in the garage.

2151
01:37:32,991 --> 01:37:34,760
It's like clunk,
clunk,

2152
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:38,660
and I opened the door and I walk out and
there's a skunk and he's got his head

2153
01:37:38,661 --> 01:37:43,661
jammed in as small hellman's mayonnaise
jar and he's trying to bang his head on

2154
01:37:44,151 --> 01:37:45,650
the ground to get it off.

2155
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:48,980
Wow.
And I felt so bad for the thing that I

2156
01:37:48,981 --> 01:37:51,140
got.
There was a golf club in the corner and

2157
01:37:51,141 --> 01:37:54,980
I got the golf club and went over and I,
I hit,

2158
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,400
I hit the,
uh,

2159
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:58,080
the glass trying to break it off.
Oh,

2160
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:01,680
Jesus.
And the skunk squirted me and then ran

2161
01:38:01,681 --> 01:38:06,150
outside and disappeared and I don't know
if he fucking died or whatever,

2162
01:38:06,151 --> 01:38:10,320
but that shit stayed on me for days.
Yeah.

2163
01:38:10,321 --> 01:38:14,010
My dog got hit when I was in Boston.
He got hit or she got hit.

2164
01:38:14,011 --> 01:38:16,710
It was a girl dark.
She got hit and I watched her in tomato

2165
01:38:16,711 --> 01:38:21,090
juice close to use.
It didn't work and it kind of worked,

2166
01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:24,330
but it didn't really work.
She smell like shit for days,

2167
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,340
days,
just forever.

2168
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,320
Yeah.
I don't know how he even wears off,

2169
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:30,810
you know?
Yeah.

2170
01:38:30,811 --> 01:38:33,540
I guess it's a,
it's a weird defense mechanism,

2171
01:38:33,610 --> 01:38:34,830
you know?
Very weird,

2172
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:36,630
you know,
they got the big stripes,

2173
01:38:36,631 --> 01:38:39,120
you associate them with the smell and
you stay article about it.

2174
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:42,450
So alcohol file thing.
Here's the.

2175
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:44,520
I was actually reading the part about
tomato juice.

2176
01:38:44,521 --> 01:38:45,750
Won't work.
Tomato juice

2177
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:48,690
do it.
It's just a strong smell that attempts

2178
01:38:48,691 --> 01:38:51,690
to cover up the smell of skunk.
What you need is a chemical that will

2179
01:38:51,691 --> 01:38:54,000
change the composition of the thiol
group.

2180
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:57,840
Fortunately baking soda and hydrogen
peroxide or cheap mild,

2181
01:38:57,841 --> 01:38:59,280
and we'll do the job.
Interesting.

2182
01:38:59,490 --> 01:39:03,780
So baking soda and Hydrogen Peroxide.
Mild oxidizing agents,

2183
01:39:03,781 --> 01:39:07,980
meaning they will attacks,
attach oxygen atoms to the sulfur atom.

2184
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:12,420
And the thiol pairing and takeaway its
ability to stink.

2185
01:39:13,510 --> 01:39:16,320
Interesting.
And water makes it worse too.

2186
01:39:16,321 --> 01:39:21,000
Apparently the chemicals are flammable.
So under the right conditions we can

2187
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:23,550
have a little stripe flame throwers run
around the woods.

2188
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:26,820
Wow.
Take a skunk.

2189
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:31,740
You fucking forced them to spray and you
just hold a lighter up to his asshole.

2190
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:37,510
I think he got a new marvel,
a character skunk man.

2191
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:38,300
Yeah,

2192
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:42,560
that's crazy that it's an alcohol based
spray coming out of an animal.

2193
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:45,410
Yeah.
And it's also like,

2194
01:39:45,650 --> 01:39:48,200
how the fuck does something evolve to
spray shit.

2195
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:52,670
I now get of all the different possible
things that could have happened through

2196
01:39:52,671 --> 01:39:55,730
natural selection.
A skunk is one of the weirder ones.

2197
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:56,613
Yeah.

2198
01:39:57,970 --> 01:40:02,830
Is there flowers to do that?
Is there a stink that's spray?

2199
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:06,520
There's flowers that do think that when
they opened they smell.

2200
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:07,990
Yeah,
I know what you're talking about.

2201
01:40:07,991 --> 01:40:11,740
I think that is a flower that is a trap
for rats.

2202
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,870
The rats.
It smells like rotten.

2203
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,121
Real.
Yeah.

2204
01:40:16,121 --> 01:40:17,620
Yeah.
You know how there's like a Venus

2205
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:21,130
flytrap,
there's also one that attracts rodents

2206
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:25,390
and it opens up and it smells like
rotten meat and they fall in it and it

2207
01:40:25,391 --> 01:40:27,340
just closes up on them and they can't
get out.

2208
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:30,970
Jesus might not close up on them.
They might not be able to climb out of

2209
01:40:30,971 --> 01:40:33,160
it.
It's like a metaphor for marriage

2210
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:39,480
right after you get to this day.
I love the smell of my wife,

2211
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:43,930
but I can't get out.

2212
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:49,070
If you could find that thing of a.
of a plant that eats mice.

2213
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:50,363
Yeah.
There it is.

2214
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:53,180
Newly discovered carnivorous jungle
plant.

2215
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:54,280
Gobbles rats.

2216
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,410
Whole who?
That poor fucking rat

2217
01:40:58,070 --> 01:41:01,860
maze a fuck bro.
I'm fucking here.

2218
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,290
I think.
Fuck it.

2219
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:06,940
I'm going to plant fucking plants.
Got Me Bro.

2220
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:09,700
Deep in the jungle.
Prime evil.

2221
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:11,110
What is,
how do you say that name?

2222
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:12,700
Nip.
Nip.

2223
01:41:12,701 --> 01:41:17,701
And the nip in this actin Oggie with two
eyes awaits.

2224
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:20,540
It's furry.
Pray.

2225
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:24,250
It's not a stuffy cat or poisonous
lizard.

2226
01:41:24,251 --> 01:41:26,220
It's a plant.
And each rats,

2227
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:28,870
uh,
it's been named after the famous

2228
01:41:28,871 --> 01:41:32,350
naturalist and TV personality,
Sir David Attenborough.

2229
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:37,780
Me Eating pitcher plants their pitcher.
Plants discovered by science and time

2230
01:41:37,781 --> 01:41:40,650
of,
I don't know who has is eating plan.

2231
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:44,590
That's insane.
For an unlucky mouse or bird became a

2232
01:41:44,591 --> 01:41:46,480
meal.
It was a rare treat,

2233
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:51,160
but this one is a vertebrate specialist.
So there are some that eat insects and

2234
01:41:51,161 --> 01:41:54,190
spiders,
but an unlucky mouse or a bird is rare.

2235
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:58,270
But these fucking plants,
this giant plant is a specialist in

2236
01:41:58,271 --> 01:41:59,104
rats.

2237
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:02,440
They lure rats with the promise of sweet
nectar,

2238
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:05,920
but when the rat leans into the plant
that drink the saccharin liquid,

2239
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:09,760
it slips on the pitcher's waxy interior
and get stuck.

2240
01:42:09,761 --> 01:42:12,160
And it's gooey sap.
Once it's trapped,

2241
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:14,530
acid,
like digestive enzymes,

2242
01:42:14,531 --> 01:42:17,050
break down the still living road and up.
Come on.

2243
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:20,770
How the fuck does that happen?
To better explain the whole process as

2244
01:42:20,771 --> 01:42:25,771
well as the life cycle of pitcher plant.
There's a video by a David Attenborough,

2245
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:30,040
the poisonous pitcher plant.
You could find that the private life of

2246
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:32,320
plants.
Plants are so fucking complicated.

2247
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:33,560
Yeah.
It's so.

2248
01:42:33,561 --> 01:42:38,561
It's so fascinating that just develop
like that's one of the real gigantic

2249
01:42:39,071 --> 01:42:42,430
problems that people have with the
deforestation of the rain forest.

2250
01:42:42,431 --> 01:42:44,770
Is their stuff down there that we
haven't even figured out yet?

2251
01:42:44,771 --> 01:42:47,980
Yeah.
Is so little of it has been explored.

2252
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:52,000
Did you see that new thing in Guatemala
where they're going through the jungle

2253
01:42:52,001 --> 01:42:53,470
and they found thousands.

2254
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:57,150
They have some new technology where they
can like see like sonar ushers.

2255
01:42:57,151 --> 01:42:59,380
Yeah,
and they found thousands of unknown

2256
01:42:59,381 --> 01:43:01,960
structures like,
like building cities.

2257
01:43:01,961 --> 01:43:04,030
Like right.
There used to be a thriving,

2258
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:06,440
some sort of a thriving community in
there.

2259
01:43:06,510 --> 01:43:08,860
He had and they say that it,
it proves,

2260
01:43:08,910 --> 01:43:12,820
it disproves a lot of theories about
were things that developed,

2261
01:43:12,821 --> 01:43:16,210
at what rate they were so far beyond
what we thought they were in terms of

2262
01:43:16,211 --> 01:43:18,380
irrigation and things like that where
you met.

2263
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:21,250
I mean it's so weird because we only
lived to be 80,

2264
01:43:21,251 --> 01:43:22,450
90 years old.
Right.

2265
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:25,900
And in that time you barely have enough
time to figure out what the fuck you're

2266
01:43:25,901 --> 01:43:28,330
doing your own life and you're like,
Hey,

2267
01:43:28,331 --> 01:43:32,650
what's that stone wall over there?
It's always been here like nobody knows.

2268
01:43:32,651 --> 01:43:35,620
I've been out of the ancient ones.
Dancer wants made it and then you die.

2269
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:37,630
And then your grandchildren here the
same story.

2270
01:43:37,631 --> 01:43:39,880
Oh the ancient ones.
They built that wall and then someone

2271
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:41,890
comes along and like 1990 and goes,
hey,

2272
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:43,590
who the fuck are the ancient ones?
Yeah.

2273
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:48,660
Like let's start doing some digs if
thank God for archaeologists and all

2274
01:43:48,851 --> 01:43:51,080
these people that are out there with
toothbrushes,

2275
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:52,010
cargo

2276
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:54,030
shorts,
with a fucking toothbrush for

2277
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:58,790
days to scrape and things.
Trying to find little bits of pottery

2278
01:43:58,791 --> 01:43:59,550
and shit.

2279
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:02,130
Did you see the new radio lab that came
out last week?

2280
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:02,941
No,
I did not.

2281
01:44:02,941 --> 01:44:04,610
Marty plants.
Oh Wow.

2282
01:44:04,630 --> 01:44:05,490
That's going to freak you out.
There's.

2283
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,040
It's only 30 minutes long.
It's a really easy listen,

2284
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:09,450
but there's a couple cool,
cool,

2285
01:44:09,451 --> 01:44:11,610
cool story to tell.
Like plants might have memory

2286
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:14,100
for instance,
and this sort of data.

2287
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:15,980
They definitely know that they
communicate.

2288
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:18,500
They allocate resources to the more
needy.

2289
01:44:18,501 --> 01:44:22,850
Amongst them,
they have some sort of a symbiotic

2290
01:44:22,851 --> 01:44:26,330
relationship with fungi.
Were they the fungi?

2291
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:30,470
The microrisal relationship between
certain plants and fungus.

2292
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:34,460
The plants in the fungus,
like exchange nutrients,

2293
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:39,080
you know,
fungus actually breathes air that they

2294
01:44:39,081 --> 01:44:41,750
breathe air and exhale carbon dioxide
like an animal,

2295
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:45,650
and then plants breathe carbon dioxide
and exhale oxygen.

2296
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:47,170
Huh?
Fuck.

2297
01:44:47,171 --> 01:44:48,560
It's madness,
man.

2298
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:50,450
Yeah,
there they are.

2299
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:54,290
Plants are a life form and we have this
thing in our head because they don't

2300
01:44:54,291 --> 01:44:56,090
move all.
They must be stupid,

2301
01:44:56,480 --> 01:45:00,680
but there are in some way communicating
with each other in a method that we

2302
01:45:00,681 --> 01:45:02,190
don't totally understand.
Yeah.

2303
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:07,660
Which fucks vegans hard.
That whole self righteousness and all

2304
01:45:07,821 --> 01:45:11,120
the craziness that comes along with
being a Vegan and cruelty free,

2305
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:15,470
not to those screaming plants that you
can't hear because they scream,

2306
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:17,510
they fucking scream.

2307
01:45:17,610 --> 01:45:20,480
Yeah.
They make noise like the end.

2308
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:23,320
They know when they're being eaten.
That's one of the weirdest things.

2309
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:26,540
Like when they.
Not only do they know when they're being

2310
01:45:26,541 --> 01:45:29,990
eaten,
if you place sounds of a caterpillar

2311
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:34,850
eating leaves next to a tree,
some trees change the composition of the

2312
01:45:34,851 --> 01:45:38,810
tastes structure of the way the plants
taste to animals.

2313
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:41,930
They becoming in the like,
what's the word?

2314
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,240
Uh,
unpalatable.

2315
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:47,600
They taste disgusting.
They're inevitable.

2316
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:50,840
Like,
so these giraffes starve to death

2317
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:54,680
because upwind,
certain drafts will be eating and then

2318
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:59,681
the wind comes down and through either a
smell or sound or some method of

2319
01:46:00,711 --> 01:46:03,350
transportation that we,
or transmission that we're not totally

2320
01:46:03,351 --> 01:46:06,560
aware of.
Everything down when is changing its

2321
01:46:06,561 --> 01:46:08,900
flavor and it becomes disgusting to the
drafts.

2322
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:10,580
Wow,
that's fucking nuts,

2323
01:46:10,581 --> 01:46:11,290
man.
It's amazing.

2324
01:46:11,290 --> 01:46:12,260
They're like,
someone's eating us.

2325
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:15,500
Fuck it.
What's crazy is it's not just something

2326
01:46:15,501 --> 01:46:18,080
biting into it.
It's the actual sound of it.

2327
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:19,550
The sound of it triggers.

2328
01:46:19,670 --> 01:46:20,503
Okay,
that's fine.

2329
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:22,190
Uh,
one of the things that talk about is

2330
01:46:22,191 --> 01:46:23,420
Dave,
that's how they find water.

2331
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:24,241
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2332
01:46:24,241 --> 01:46:24,800
yeah,
yeah.

2333
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,850
No,
I've read about that.

2334
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,120
They,
they hear the sound of water and they

2335
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:32,060
grow towards it.
What's crazy is they've played

2336
01:46:32,061 --> 01:46:37,061
recordings of the sound of water and
plants grow towards the recordings.

2337
01:46:38,290 --> 01:46:40,870
So what the fuck is going on with those
things?

2338
01:46:40,871 --> 01:46:45,871
So they have auditory canals and some
said the roots have a very similar hair

2339
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:50,040
follicle like we have in our ear,
which is you actually hear you here.

2340
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,860
You're picking up vibrations on the
hairs and that's what their roots are

2341
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:55,270
made up of.
Tons and tons of tiny little fiber.

2342
01:46:55,271 --> 01:47:00,150
Like heres that become a root fuck.
It's amazing.

2343
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,280
And the difference is if I eat an
animal,

2344
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:06,120
it's been killed and I'm eating the dead
flesh theory and a salad.

2345
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:07,590
Some of that Shit's still alive.

2346
01:47:07,690 --> 01:47:09,550
Yeah.
Maybe that's okay.

2347
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:11,980
Maybe it's okay.
I mean,

2348
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,290
here's the thing,
maybe it's all okay,

2349
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:18,920
but we have this idea that some life is
more important than other labs.

2350
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:21,400
That intelligent life is more important
than non-intelligent life.

2351
01:47:21,790 --> 01:47:22,623
Right.

2352
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:25,560
I know they did this whole thing with
the Olympics about how,

2353
01:47:25,890 --> 01:47:30,890
how many dislike 2000 dog,
a farms in South Korea where they breed

2354
01:47:32,101 --> 01:47:36,240
dogs for eating and you go there and
it's like they're just regular fucking

2355
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:38,220
dogs.
A whole variety like you would see in a

2356
01:47:38,221 --> 01:47:42,360
pet store and you know,
and we were outraged by it and we've

2357
01:47:42,361 --> 01:47:43,740
sent out,
you know,

2358
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:47,010
there's people that fly over from the
states and they adopt one pet.

2359
01:47:47,011 --> 01:47:50,940
Meanwhile there's like hundreds of
thousands and you get maybe 50 rich

2360
01:47:50,941 --> 01:47:53,370
Americans come over and adopt a pet and
bring it back.

2361
01:47:54,370 --> 01:47:57,840
I rescued her,
I rescued her from a Korean factory.

2362
01:47:57,841 --> 01:48:01,480
They made burgers out of her.
Yeah.

2363
01:48:01,650 --> 01:48:05,880
But that's weird.
I mean for some people a dog is food and

2364
01:48:05,881 --> 01:48:07,110
a.
well,

2365
01:48:07,111 --> 01:48:08,100
what does that Jamie,
you know,

2366
01:48:08,101 --> 01:48:10,260
pigs are like one of the most
intelligent animals.

2367
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:12,880
What does that.
That's a dog farm to rows.

2368
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,020
Cages that will be used for dogs.
Oh my God.

2369
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:19,410
Yeah.
But meanwhile those chickens,

2370
01:48:19,411 --> 01:48:22,890
I wouldn't give a fuck billard well I
don't like that.

2371
01:48:22,891 --> 01:48:25,530
They have to live like that,
but I like chicken so

2372
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:28,330
he ever like stop and go.
You're in the middle of eating chicken

2373
01:48:28,331 --> 01:48:31,150
and ego.
This is five meals in a row that I've

2374
01:48:31,151 --> 01:48:33,840
eaten a fucking chicken eggs.
Yeah.

2375
01:48:33,850 --> 01:48:36,520
It's crazy how much of those hormones I
must have in my body.

2376
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:39,750
There's a big misconception about that.
Yeah.

2377
01:48:39,751 --> 01:48:42,700
Most chickens that you're eating don't
have hormones in them.

2378
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:45,750
Hormones are expensive and you don't
have to give the chickens hormones.

2379
01:48:45,751 --> 01:48:48,630
The hormones that the.
The idea is that you give a chicken

2380
01:48:48,631 --> 01:48:49,830
hormone.
That's why they're so big,

2381
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:52,380
but now they're so big through selective
breeding.

2382
01:48:52,410 --> 01:48:55,440
They've essentially like if you take
that girl with giant tits and you

2383
01:48:55,441 --> 01:48:59,280
breeder with a guy whose mom has giant
tits and everybody gets together and

2384
01:48:59,281 --> 01:49:02,550
then you have just a giant tip family.
That's essentially what they've done

2385
01:49:02,551 --> 01:49:04,470
with these chickens.
They figured out a way to breathe.

2386
01:49:04,471 --> 01:49:08,420
These chickens were.
They have preposterously large breasts

2387
01:49:08,530 --> 01:49:09,610
and they can't walk.
Sometimes.

2388
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:11,760
They're all fucked up.
Yeah.

2389
01:49:11,790 --> 01:49:14,070
They're not like a regular,
like the chickens I have in my yard.

2390
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:16,650
They run around,
they jump up in there and they fly a

2391
01:49:16,651 --> 01:49:18,650
couple of steps.
There are normal checks,

2392
01:49:18,651 --> 01:49:20,130
so they're flat chested.
They're,

2393
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:21,510
yeah,
they're like little,

2394
01:49:21,511 --> 01:49:22,950
uh,
gymnastics chickens

2395
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:27,750
as opposed to a stripper chickens.
You want to get some stripper chickens

2396
01:49:27,751 --> 01:49:30,300
with double e fake tits that can crush
beer cans.

2397
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:32,130
Ever seen those gals and they hold a
beer.

2398
01:49:32,131 --> 01:49:35,130
Can they take one of their whoppers and
they just smashed that beer can with

2399
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:39,100
them dinner.
We'll have glitter on the chicken and

2400
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:40,110
she's got a backstory.

2401
01:49:42,930 --> 01:49:44,760
Why third dollar bill inside the
chicken?

2402
01:49:44,850 --> 01:49:46,380
Yeah.
So when you think that you're getting

2403
01:49:46,381 --> 01:49:48,010
hormones from

2404
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:51,070
food,
most likely that's not the case,

2405
01:49:51,190 --> 01:49:54,550
but it's highly likely that,
especially with beef,

2406
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:59,110
especially corn fed beef,
you're getting antibiotics because they

2407
01:49:59,111 --> 01:50:02,260
get sick,
so you're most likely not getting

2408
01:50:02,261 --> 01:50:04,930
hormones,
but there's some hormones in the animal

2409
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:08,830
themselves and there's a certain amount
of selective breeding that I'm sure

2410
01:50:08,831 --> 01:50:11,350
would have more homework hormones than
less,

2411
01:50:11,351 --> 01:50:15,910
which would encourage the animals to
have like larger bodies and develop more

2412
01:50:15,911 --> 01:50:18,850
food.
But I think for the most part the

2413
01:50:18,851 --> 01:50:23,851
largeness is due to their diet.
Like if you take a cow and you feed it

2414
01:50:23,861 --> 01:50:27,250
grass,
it takes much longer than for them to

2415
01:50:27,251 --> 01:50:30,910
reach the size that they would like the
cow to reach before they butcher it.

2416
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:34,570
But if you feed them corn,
they fattened up real quick.

2417
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:37,180
And then obviously the,
there's extremes like that.

2418
01:50:37,181 --> 01:50:40,600
Why Goose Shit and Coby coby before you
get.

2419
01:50:40,601 --> 01:50:42,370
It's just literally a dying animal.

2420
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:44,650
It's filled with fat.
You ever get those things?

2421
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:46,990
Yeah.
It's like if Mike Sullivan Irwin was a

2422
01:50:46,991 --> 01:50:47,870
cow.
It's.

2423
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:49,383
Sorry,
Mike,

2424
01:50:49,470 --> 01:50:50,860
rest in peace.
God bless you.

2425
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:53,150
He's up there.
Um,

2426
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:56,830
this,
this cow is essentially like they've

2427
01:50:56,831 --> 01:51:01,550
just given this guy this terrible diet
and they fat all over their body but,

2428
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:04,780
and no exercise and even massage them,
I think.

2429
01:51:04,781 --> 01:51:06,850
Yeah,
I think they do in Japan that's like

2430
01:51:06,851 --> 01:51:09,280
part of the deal they did.
They give them beer and then they

2431
01:51:09,281 --> 01:51:11,290
massage them.
Is there a happy ending?

2432
01:51:12,810 --> 01:51:14,230
No,
because their steers.

2433
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:16,180
So if their steers it means they don't
have any balls.

2434
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:19,930
Know a steer is they take a bull,
like cut his balls off.

2435
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:23,140
And that's what a steer is.
Most of the time when you're buying,

2436
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:25,540
if you buy ground beef,
I think,

2437
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:28,900
I hope I'm not wrong with this,
but I think sometimes ground beef is a

2438
01:51:28,910 --> 01:51:31,760
cow,
like a female and um,

2439
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:35,440
they like maybe they stopped producing
milk or they get to a certain age and

2440
01:51:35,441 --> 01:51:36,790
they shoot them and then they grind them
up.

2441
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:41,310
But if you buy steaks like USD,
a prime t bone,

2442
01:51:41,311 --> 01:51:42,820
you know,
nice t bone steak that's coming from a

2443
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:46,120
steer.
So that's a cow that cut his balls off

2444
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:48,460
and then they,
they fatten them up,

2445
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:50,820
huh?
Didn't know that ground beef is the,

2446
01:51:50,821 --> 01:51:53,890
uh,
the cow sometimes think ground beef

2447
01:51:53,891 --> 01:51:56,350
sometimes can be steered to like certain
cuts.

2448
01:51:56,410 --> 01:51:59,290
But I think in some cases,
I hope I'm not wrong about this,

2449
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:03,400
but I do know that most of the stakes
you get if you buy like a nice rib eye

2450
01:52:03,401 --> 01:52:05,140
or something like that,
you're getting it from a steer.

2451
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:07,330
Isn't there also some chemical that's
released,

2452
01:52:07,331 --> 01:52:10,660
they say when they slaughter beef that
they get scared.

2453
01:52:10,661 --> 01:52:13,150
Adrenaline,
it then that you're eating some kind of

2454
01:52:13,151 --> 01:52:15,490
a chemical sometimes as a result?
Well,

2455
01:52:15,491 --> 01:52:20,380
there is a definite taste that people
think happens to an animal when they're

2456
01:52:20,381 --> 01:52:21,740
scared.
Um,

2457
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:25,570
and you,
if you shoot an animal and it's wounded

2458
01:52:25,571 --> 01:52:29,470
and it scared and maybe you have to
follow up with a second shot or

2459
01:52:29,471 --> 01:52:32,650
something like that,
that animal will not taste as good as an

2460
01:52:32,651 --> 01:52:35,170
animal that has no idea what hit it.
Yeah.

2461
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:38,260
That's why I'm.
There's a guy that I know that's a chef

2462
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:42,730
of a very famous San Francisco
restaurant say song.

2463
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:44,410
I think it is.
I think that's the name of it.

2464
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:46,080
It was on my friend Steve [inaudible]

2465
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:49,160
podcast.
Steve Rinella has a podcast called meat

2466
01:52:49,161 --> 01:52:52,130
eater and he's a pretty famous hunter
and chef himself.

2467
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:54,650
But one of the things that,
this chef of this,

2468
01:52:54,651 --> 01:52:58,340
uh,
this like one of the very few Michelin

2469
01:52:58,370 --> 01:53:01,580
Blah Blah Blah stars,
I don't know how many fucking Michelin

2470
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:02,690
Stars and ask,
but it's like very,

2471
01:53:02,691 --> 01:53:05,900
very highly rated restaurant.
He shoots the animals in the head only,

2472
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:09,950
like when he goes hunting,
he's hunting and he only shoots them in

2473
01:53:09,951 --> 01:53:12,500
the head.
So he has to have like a close shot with

2474
01:53:12,501 --> 01:53:15,560
a very accurate rifle.
Shoots him in the head so they die

2475
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:17,450
instantly.
They have no idea what happened.

2476
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:18,501
Boom.
They're dead,

2477
01:53:18,501 --> 01:53:20,030
no adrenaline dump,
nothing.

2478
01:53:20,350 --> 01:53:23,480
And then that way,
according to him,

2479
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:26,060
you get the finest flavor from the food.
Wow.

2480
01:53:26,150 --> 01:53:28,570
Yeah.
That's a harder shot to because that's

2481
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:30,380
the thing that's moving the most on the
animal.

2482
01:53:30,381 --> 01:53:31,670
The head could be.

2483
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:34,340
I mean it could just be sitting there
eating like a lot of times they're

2484
01:53:34,341 --> 01:53:37,670
eating grass or something like that.
I mean this is obviously we're talking

2485
01:53:37,671 --> 01:53:39,980
about wild animals,
you know,

2486
01:53:39,981 --> 01:53:43,100
it'd be really easy to do for a cow or
something like that.

2487
01:53:43,101 --> 01:53:45,260
They would have no idea.
They're just sitting there eating.

2488
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:48,980
You could set up on a bench with a rifle
and just take them out and they would

2489
01:53:48,981 --> 01:53:51,140
have no idea,
but most of the time with cows,

2490
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:55,430
they use that cattle rod on that brain
that that guy used in no country for old

2491
01:53:55,431 --> 01:53:58,200
men from that dude come around with that
and he put it on people's heads and

2492
01:53:58,210 --> 01:53:59,680
punk.
Yeah.

2493
01:53:59,690 --> 01:54:00,950
That's how they.
They killed cows.

2494
01:54:01,690 --> 01:54:06,230
They're being corralled into the,
into the slaughterhouse and they know

2495
01:54:06,231 --> 01:54:08,270
what's happening.
They know something's not good.

2496
01:54:08,290 --> 01:54:10,220
Yeah.
I don't think they know exactly what it

2497
01:54:10,221 --> 01:54:11,480
is,
but they definitely think they're

2498
01:54:11,481 --> 01:54:11,960
fucking hell.

2499
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:15,650
I think if plants can tell that a
giraffe is eating from a mile away,

2500
01:54:15,651 --> 01:54:19,910
I think cows can tell that they're.
There is a killing field right in front

2501
01:54:19,911 --> 01:54:23,810
of them.
You know the worship is kosher ally.

2502
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:26,260
The way they do it.
I don't know about this.

2503
01:54:26,261 --> 01:54:30,200
Slice their neck and the bleed out and
then they hang them up by their ankles

2504
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:33,740
and flopping around bleeding.
It's terrible.

2505
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:35,240
Cows.
Cows.

2506
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:37,250
Yeah.
When you buy kosher beef,

2507
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:42,650
there's a very specific ritual that has
to be gone through.

2508
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:46,760
That has to be accomplished.
In order to proclaim beef kosher,

2509
01:54:46,761 --> 01:54:50,930
it has to be a very sharp knife and I
believe it all has to be done by a rabbi

2510
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:52,513
Steve.
That's true.

2511
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:53,510
Damn.
Yeah,

2512
01:54:53,540 --> 01:54:56,210
but I've watched it.
I've watched in videos and it's like,

2513
01:54:56,211 --> 01:54:57,980
okay,
this is terrible,

2514
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:59,690
but kosher hot dogs.
Pretty good.

2515
01:54:59,691 --> 01:55:02,120
They're delicious.
They're the best.

2516
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:03,770
They really are.
I mean,

2517
01:55:03,771 --> 01:55:05,790
it's like it's.
It's like two different types of food.

2518
01:55:05,791 --> 01:55:08,340
There's kosher hot dogs and they're
shitty hot dogs.

2519
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:11,930
Think Kosher also in it.
It has to be hormone free,

2520
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:16,100
it has to be antibiotics free and I
think they have to be on a specific

2521
01:55:16,101 --> 01:55:17,750
diet,
doesn't have a bunch of things.

2522
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:20,890
Regular hot dogs.
They put the fucking beaks and the fee,

2523
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:22,020
everything.
Assholes,

2524
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:25,190
dicks and I think with kosher that they
don't put all that shit in there.

2525
01:55:25,370 --> 01:55:28,910
Maybe that would make sense.
Hotdog in a while.

2526
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,490
Yeah.
Well good fucking New York City hot dog.

2527
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:35,830
It's hard.
Some onions on there are some relevant

2528
01:55:35,831 --> 01:55:38,510
you put on your hot dog.
I'm a big Sauerkraut guy.

2529
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:40,490
Sally Brown.
Spicy mustard.

2530
01:55:40,870 --> 01:55:42,640
Yeah.
I love that.

2531
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:44,280
Come.
I like gray's

2532
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:46,700
Papaya on sixth avenue.
That's a good spot.

2533
01:55:46,770 --> 01:55:50,460
You get two dogs and the Papaya drink
for like $3 it's bought.

2534
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:51,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

2535
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:54,810
That's an interesting place to.
It's like probably hasn't changed much

2536
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:56,430
since the beginning of time.
No.

2537
01:55:56,431 --> 01:55:58,830
As a matter of fact,
I know a gray.

2538
01:55:58,831 --> 01:56:03,150
Sheila Gray is the granddaughter of the
Guy who started them and the guy who

2539
01:56:03,151 --> 01:56:08,070
started them was a famous Broadway
producer who'd won Tony Awards for some

2540
01:56:08,071 --> 01:56:12,180
of the shows that he made,
and then he used the money to buy first,

2541
01:56:12,181 --> 01:56:16,290
the one on sixth avenue and then he
opened up another one up on 72nd and

2542
01:56:16,291 --> 01:56:19,750
Broadway.
There's another gray's Papaya and uh,

2543
01:56:19,770 --> 01:56:22,950
she's a great acting teacher.
I went to her,

2544
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:26,730
she's a coach and I used to go to her
classes and then I went in one time for

2545
01:56:26,731 --> 01:56:29,130
a private session at our apartment and
uh,

2546
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:31,350
when I was coming out she was like,
you gotta go,

2547
01:56:31,351 --> 01:56:32,760
you gotta go.
It's like a rush job.

2548
01:56:32,761 --> 01:56:33,511
I'm like,
what the fuck?

2549
01:56:33,511 --> 01:56:36,600
And I walk out and Mariah Carey standing
there waiting to come in and get

2550
01:56:36,601 --> 01:56:39,250
coached.
Right.

2551
01:56:39,310 --> 01:56:43,200
Carriers take an ironman was a weird
transition,

2552
01:56:43,201 --> 01:56:45,570
right?
Like it's a normal transition for comic

2553
01:56:45,571 --> 01:56:48,210
to become an actor or a singer.
I now it's like,

2554
01:56:48,211 --> 01:56:49,380
Huh,
alright,

2555
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:50,880
rappers can do it.
No problem.

2556
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:54,210
Rappers seemed to be make they make this
transition.

2557
01:56:54,211 --> 01:56:56,910
Yeah.
Twelve years now tonight's show Tupac to

2558
01:56:56,911 --> 01:56:58,250
the gangways.
Yeah.

2559
01:56:58,820 --> 01:56:59,910
Big.
He never did a movie though,

2560
01:56:59,911 --> 01:57:00,860
did he?
Nope.

2561
01:57:01,790 --> 01:57:02,623
Hmm.

2562
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:05,910
Interesting.
Yeah,

2563
01:57:05,911 --> 01:57:07,650
he's my favorite.
He's my favorite of all time.

2564
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:08,503
Yeah.

2565
01:57:09,250 --> 01:57:11,840
Uh,
only one who is knowledgeable in the

2566
01:57:11,841 --> 01:57:14,600
laws of slaughtering.
Know what does that Word Sha,

2567
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:18,680
she wears red when we need them.
Call them up on his flip phone.

2568
01:57:19,610 --> 01:57:24,610
S h e e h I t a h shit say shit.
Shahita and proficient in its practice.

2569
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:33,920
And who is a believing pious Jew may act
as the slaughterer show het in

2570
01:57:36,511 --> 01:57:41,060
performance of the commandment.
It is the prevalent custom that this

2571
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:45,880
show hat must receive written
authorization from a recognized

2572
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:49,770
Rabbinical Authority attesting to the
aforesaid qualifications.

2573
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:52,080
Okay,
so you have to.

2574
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:56,940
You have to have written authorization
from a rabbi saying that you know what

2575
01:57:56,941 --> 01:58:01,941
you're doing the shit to a must be done
by means of a swift smooth cut of a

2576
01:58:03,571 --> 01:58:08,010
sharp knife who's blade is free of any
dent or imperfection.

2577
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:11,090
Wow.
The Shit Shea,

2578
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:13,220
he's probably screaming at us.
Her sugars

2579
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:20,400
entails severing the trachea and
Esophagus in according with the oral

2580
01:58:20,401 --> 01:58:23,550
tradition,
which requires that five improper

2581
01:58:23,551 --> 01:58:27,990
procedures be avoided less.
They invalidate that Shahita and render

2582
01:58:27,991 --> 01:58:30,240
the animal unfit to be eaten.
Wow.

2583
01:58:30,450 --> 01:58:34,140
There a hesitation or delay while
drawing the knife.

2584
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:36,420
If you hesitate.
Oh No.

2585
01:58:36,510 --> 01:58:37,110
Oh,
it's all over.

2586
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:40,890
Don't eat the cow.
Excessive pressure or chopping.

2587
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:42,670
You can't eat it.
Burrowing

2588
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:46,720
the knife between the trachea and the
esophagus or under the skin.

2589
01:58:46,810 --> 01:58:48,130
You can't eat it.
Diy,

2590
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:51,670
making the incision outside the specific
area.

2591
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:56,760
You can't eat it and he laceration or
tearing of the trachea or Esophagus,

2592
01:58:57,220 --> 01:58:59,620
which would result from an imperfect
blade.

2593
01:58:59,860 --> 01:59:04,510
An animal or foul that has been
improperly slaughtered or as already

2594
01:59:04,511 --> 01:59:09,070
noted that is not slaughtered but dies
of itself is considered carrion.

2595
01:59:09,730 --> 01:59:10,820
Nevada.
Huh?

2596
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,360
An unfit for food.
God,

2597
01:59:13,361 --> 01:59:16,030
they're picky.
That's so picky.

2598
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:20,710
It is forbidden to slaughter the parent
with its young on the same day.

2599
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:25,920
It's in leviticus 20 to 28.
Leviticus set some hard core shift.

2600
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:28,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

2601
01:59:28,331 --> 01:59:33,331
That's a hardcore book of the Bible.
That's the quote from pulp fiction that,

2602
01:59:33,401 --> 01:59:34,690
uh,
that uh,

2603
01:59:34,710 --> 01:59:38,800
Sam pond,
the what great veterinarians and furious

2604
01:59:38,801 --> 01:59:43,801
anger Zico is that you from a few kilos.
A weird to like [inaudible] the one that

2605
01:59:46,301 --> 01:59:49,240
the Ufo dorks always point to because
Zika equal,

2606
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:52,090
um,
had some sort of a vision of a wheel

2607
01:59:52,091 --> 01:59:54,610
within a wheel,
like some sort of vision that they,

2608
01:59:54,611 --> 01:59:56,970
they think was some visitor from outer
space.

2609
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:57,833
Oh,
no shit.

2610
01:59:58,210 --> 01:59:59,770
Wow.
I think they were tripping.

2611
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:02,320
I think they're just eating mushrooms.
That's what I think.

2612
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,393
Well,
yeah.

2613
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:04,600
Well the last book,
the,

2614
02:00:04,601 --> 02:00:06,340
uh,
about the uh,

2615
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:09,220
Armageddon.
That's fucking trippy.

2616
02:00:09,230 --> 02:00:12,310
That's a bad trip.
Wrote it all down.

2617
02:00:12,370 --> 02:00:15,760
Well they say that the,
I forget who wrote the book of

2618
02:00:15,761 --> 02:00:19,570
revelations,
but they say that it occurred at the

2619
02:00:19,571 --> 02:00:21,400
same time as the,
uh,

2620
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:26,560
pompei exploded and that he was really
just describing what was happening

2621
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:28,810
really in Italy when this pump,
hey,

2622
02:00:28,811 --> 02:00:31,750
I want to feel like I feel like 100 or
something add.

2623
02:00:31,870 --> 02:00:32,703
Yeah.
Right.

2624
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:34,540
Well,
most of the Bible wasn't written until

2625
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:36,820
two or 300 years.
Testament.

2626
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:38,580
Yeah.
Well,

2627
02:00:38,710 --> 02:00:43,150
but a lot of it was like older stories
that they had to pick and choose what to

2628
02:00:43,151 --> 02:00:44,050
keep.
Yeah.

2629
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:45,430
There it goes.
Seventy nine,

2630
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:50,440
79 in the summer around August 24th,
25th.

2631
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,590
Probably visited.
Did you go there when you went to Italy?

2632
02:00:53,650 --> 02:00:55,780
I did not plan.
It was pretty wild.

2633
02:00:55,781 --> 02:00:56,920
Yeah,
I did not.

2634
02:00:57,130 --> 02:00:59,080
I was having such a good time in
Ravello.

2635
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:01,630
I just stayed up there.
And [inaudible] posten swam.

2636
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:03,490
Yeah.
Is that on the uh,

2637
02:01:03,491 --> 02:01:06,130
the uh,
mafi coast mouth because yeah,

2638
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:09,310
we went to Ravello which is up high and
then we went to Moffitt coast,

2639
02:01:09,311 --> 02:01:10,390
which is down low.
Yeah.

2640
02:01:10,391 --> 02:01:12,190
And then we went to Capri,
went to the aisle.

2641
02:01:12,191 --> 02:01:13,024
Oh,
you did?

2642
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:15,070
I hear that.
That boat ride is a little crowded

2643
02:01:15,071 --> 02:01:17,320
though.
It's not the best.

2644
02:01:17,740 --> 02:01:20,110
It's just you just deal with it.
You get to the island,

2645
02:01:20,111 --> 02:01:23,380
you have awesome fish and seafood.
The fucking food there.

2646
02:01:23,381 --> 02:01:25,260
It's just so amazing.
Yeah.

2647
02:01:25,330 --> 02:01:28,930
Yeah.
I throw all my dietary restrictions out

2648
02:01:28,931 --> 02:01:31,990
the goddamn window.
If I go to Italy somehow they don't get

2649
02:01:31,991 --> 02:01:32,711
fat.
I mean,

2650
02:01:32,711 --> 02:01:37,480
you're in Italy and these people are
eating pasta and cheese and wine and

2651
02:01:37,481 --> 02:01:40,310
they just seemed get a little launch,

2652
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,560
but that's about it.
Yeah.

2653
02:01:41,660 --> 02:01:44,150
Well they walked there was crazy.
Is that.

2654
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:47,300
I also think that they're dealing with
heirloom wheat.

2655
02:01:47,590 --> 02:01:50,220
Wheat is a different kind of wheat and
it's uh,

2656
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:52,280
you know,
the wheat that we have today and someone

2657
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:53,670
corrected me on this.
Um,

2658
02:01:53,750 --> 02:01:56,990
I guess I use the wrong term when I said
genetically modified.

2659
02:01:57,020 --> 02:02:00,440
It has been modified,
but it's been modified to traditional

2660
02:02:00,441 --> 02:02:03,160
agricultural methods of splicing and you
know,

2661
02:02:03,230 --> 02:02:05,780
how the fuck they did it.
It's not like it was done with a dude in

2662
02:02:05,781 --> 02:02:06,710
a lab coat.
Yeah.

2663
02:02:06,770 --> 02:02:10,760
But nonetheless,
the wheat that you get today is very

2664
02:02:10,761 --> 02:02:14,450
different than the wheat of say,
200 years ago that we'd have 200 years

2665
02:02:14,451 --> 02:02:16,310
ago.
It was a small plant.

2666
02:02:16,311 --> 02:02:19,100
It didn't have a high yield.
And now when they,

2667
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:22,610
what they've done through this selective
breeding is create this really thick

2668
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:26,300
heavy wheat that has a lot of complex
glutens.

2669
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:29,360
And that's one of the reasons why so
many people have gluten sensitivity

2670
02:02:29,361 --> 02:02:31,100
today.
It's just a more complex thing for your

2671
02:02:31,101 --> 02:02:34,490
body digest.
So if you're eating fucking wonder bread

2672
02:02:34,491 --> 02:02:39,491
and shit and all that stuff is just
sitting in your gut like that feeling,

2673
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:41,510
that's what it feels like,
right?

2674
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:44,000
When you have a big fucking bowl of
pasta,

2675
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:47,810
you feel like there's like because
that's what your body's doing,

2676
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:52,400
your body's trying to compress and
digested and what do we do with all this

2677
02:02:52,401 --> 02:02:54,590
stuff?
So this fucking glue,

2678
02:02:54,591 --> 02:02:57,310
this asshole just ate.
He just ate paste.

2679
02:02:58,130 --> 02:03:00,860
Not only that,
but why is it with pasta they give you

2680
02:03:00,861 --> 02:03:04,970
like it's the size of your head.
Do I need that much of this shit?

2681
02:03:04,971 --> 02:03:07,550
There's no other meal.
They give you that quantity of oil.

2682
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,860
They used to be a restaurant in Santa
Monica called Il Grano and it's done.

2683
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:14,000
It's done now.
It went,

2684
02:03:14,090 --> 02:03:17,870
it went under,
but when it first opened it was fucking

2685
02:03:17,871 --> 02:03:21,890
amazing.
And callen took me there and we ate

2686
02:03:21,891 --> 02:03:26,891
there and we had squid ink pasta and
they would give you like it was a multi

2687
02:03:27,501 --> 02:03:30,020
course meal where they'd give you like a
plate of this and play that in.

2688
02:03:30,021 --> 02:03:31,850
Every plate was about the size of your
fist.

2689
02:03:31,851 --> 02:03:33,920
Everything was fairly small.
That's it right there.

2690
02:03:34,130 --> 02:03:35,840
Woo.
That shit was good.

2691
02:03:35,841 --> 02:03:38,780
That's got um,
sea urchin on top of it,

2692
02:03:38,810 --> 02:03:41,510
which is amazing.
But squid ink pasta,

2693
02:03:42,410 --> 02:03:47,270
stuff that we had had a crab,
it had dungeness crab and squinting

2694
02:03:47,271 --> 02:03:48,650
pasta.
To this day,

2695
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:50,540
I think about it,
it's like one of the most delicious

2696
02:03:50,541 --> 02:03:54,380
things I've ever eaten in my life.
But small portion and not the size of

2697
02:03:54,381 --> 02:03:55,430
your fucking head,
right?

2698
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:57,560
Yeah.
He forgot to cheesecake factory.

2699
02:03:57,710 --> 02:04:01,060
The other fat people eat traits,
you know,

2700
02:04:01,070 --> 02:04:02,360
it's the worst book.

2701
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:05,230
Epo or the best depending on if you
want.

2702
02:04:06,020 --> 02:04:09,020
I used to work there.
Oh they did in Columbus,

2703
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:12,920
they give you a goddamn bathtub full of
Pasta,

2704
02:04:13,010 --> 02:04:14,870
family style.
So it's not for one person,

2705
02:04:14,871 --> 02:04:17,660
but yeah,
misconception they get crazy though.

2706
02:04:17,661 --> 02:04:20,120
They give you like a Rigatoni with meat
sauce and cheese and you're like,

2707
02:04:20,121 --> 02:04:21,830
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

2708
02:04:21,850 --> 02:04:24,530
Who the fuck is eating all this?
But if you're,

2709
02:04:24,531 --> 02:04:27,530
if you just want a gorge,
he just want to go deep.

2710
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:32,560
It's amazing.
You know Lasagna big fucking trail is on

2711
02:04:32,970 --> 02:04:36,020
all four knows my oh dude.
Pizza and Pasta.

2712
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:38,070
Woo.
That

2713
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:41,610
was one of my favorite trump stories.
The trump story about the pizza with

2714
02:04:41,611 --> 02:04:44,810
little pizzas on top of it to verify
that that was.

2715
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:48,960
That's what he was eating.
One of the stories of one of his

2716
02:04:48,961 --> 02:04:51,000
mistresses.
That's one of the things that she said

2717
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:53,820
is that he ordered a pizza,
but for the toppings you want little

2718
02:04:53,821 --> 02:04:55,080
pizzas on the pizza.

2719
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:04,130
I don't know if that's not real,
but that just like him.

2720
02:05:04,190 --> 02:05:06,860
He also got shit for when he was in New
York and he was running.

2721
02:05:06,861 --> 02:05:11,360
He ate a pizza with a knife and a fork
and he got a ton of shit about that.

2722
02:05:12,410 --> 02:05:14,540
Maybe doesn't get his hands dirty at
satire.

2723
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:17,300
It is outside.
I mean it sounded so fake that it sounds

2724
02:05:17,301 --> 02:05:18,420
so good though.
That's great.

2725
02:05:18,650 --> 02:05:20,690
Sounds so good.
That is something that someone should

2726
02:05:20,691 --> 02:05:23,840
make pizzas a little pizzas as topping.
That's real.

2727
02:05:23,841 --> 02:05:25,990
The trump,
the trump part of it was fake like him

2728
02:05:26,070 --> 02:05:27,240
saying,
oh,

2729
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:30,890
but there is really pizzas with little
pizzas on top of that.

2730
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:33,620
Some restaurant.
I don't even want it.

2731
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:34,880
I'll show you what.
I don't want it,

2732
02:05:34,881 --> 02:05:37,070
but I.
I want to be there when it gets made.

2733
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:40,430
Well,
what is it that they stuff in the crust,

2734
02:05:40,431 --> 02:05:42,020
if pizzas now look at that.

2735
02:05:42,130 --> 02:05:43,830
It's a pizza with little pizzas on top
of it.

2736
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:46,160
Wow.
That actually looks delicious.

2737
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:47,570
Oh,
and it's a bunch of different kinds of

2738
02:05:47,710 --> 02:05:51,890
pizzas on top of it.
I like Pizza Hut.

2739
02:05:51,891 --> 02:05:54,530
Got Better.
Did it not pizza at Domino's.

2740
02:05:54,770 --> 02:05:58,340
Did it?
Domino's used to fucking suck really?

2741
02:05:58,460 --> 02:06:01,640
But now it's like decent pizza.
Wow.

2742
02:06:01,700 --> 02:06:03,680
Paid for by dominoes.
All right.

2743
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:08,510
When was the last time you had it?
A couple of months ago was a bad.

2744
02:06:08,730 --> 02:06:10,320
It wasn't bad.
Yeah.

2745
02:06:10,490 --> 02:06:13,820
I mean,
I hate to sound like every other New

2746
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:14,541
Yorker,
but it really is.

2747
02:06:14,541 --> 02:06:16,970
It's hard to find pizza out here in la.
It's decent.

2748
02:06:17,180 --> 02:06:18,110
It's the water,
right?

2749
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:21,260
That's what everybody says so.
But has anybody made a real pizza where

2750
02:06:21,261 --> 02:06:24,530
they took the water from New York and
brought it over here?

2751
02:06:25,550 --> 02:06:28,220
Can you steal water from New York and
bring it to a business in la?

2752
02:06:28,250 --> 02:06:30,350
Can you just like open up a fucking
faucet?

2753
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:32,360
Philip jugs?
We need it.

2754
02:06:32,510 --> 02:06:33,920
We're going dry again.
I love it.

2755
02:06:33,921 --> 02:06:38,330
We had a drought last year that was so
devastating that it was all anybody

2756
02:06:38,331 --> 02:06:41,450
talked about and we got,
what do we get a month of rain,

2757
02:06:41,540 --> 02:06:43,010
and then they just said,
okay,

2758
02:06:43,011 --> 02:06:45,910
all restrictions are off now,
and our course,

2759
02:06:45,911 --> 02:06:47,330
six months later they're like,
oh,

2760
02:06:47,331 --> 02:06:48,650
we got another drought coming.
It's like,

2761
02:06:48,770 --> 02:06:52,490
how about we just don't take fucking 20
minute showers permanently.

2762
02:06:52,491 --> 02:06:54,290
Yeah,
but they feel good and you're not going

2763
02:06:54,291 --> 02:06:55,540
to live forever,
so yeah,

2764
02:06:55,580 --> 02:06:57,980
fuck all these people.
Get your water from Portland.

2765
02:06:58,160 --> 02:07:01,490
Yeah.
Just put a pipe up in Seattle and bring

2766
02:07:01,491 --> 02:07:05,150
that God damn water down here.
That's what was happening during the

2767
02:07:05,151 --> 02:07:05,811
drought.
When,

2768
02:07:05,811 --> 02:07:07,070
uh,
what's the,

2769
02:07:07,071 --> 02:07:08,660
what's the rich town up by Santa
Barbara?

2770
02:07:08,730 --> 02:07:11,660
Mendocino,
Montecito on a cdot with Oprah and all

2771
02:07:11,661 --> 02:07:13,430
these people.
Apparently they were bringing in so many

2772
02:07:13,431 --> 02:07:18,431
tankers fill a water to water their
grass that it was like damaging the

2773
02:07:18,681 --> 02:07:22,700
streets of Montecito and the other
citizens were complaining about the

2774
02:07:22,701 --> 02:07:26,230
tankers that were coming to the tankers
were fucking up the road.

2775
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:29,240
That's a.
There are some rich fucking people up

2776
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,790
there.
There's a house that I saw that was up

2777
02:07:31,791 --> 02:07:35,030
there for sale for $85,000,000.
No Shit.

2778
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:40,180
Imagine how a baller you have to be to
spend $85,000,000 and pay the taxes and

2779
02:07:42,401 --> 02:07:43,460
the maintenance on it.
Oh yeah.

2780
02:07:43,590 --> 02:07:44,423
Every month.
Yeah.

2781
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:45,730
Yeah.
How about your mortgage?

2782
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:47,800
What's your mortgage on $85,000,000
house?

2783
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:53,660
Well,
I'll say it's like $150,000 a month as a

2784
02:07:54,190 --> 02:07:55,840
million dollars.
Million dollars of cost.

2785
02:07:55,841 --> 02:07:57,940
You about $4,000 a month.
Here we go.

2786
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,130
So Barbara,
$85,000,000.

2787
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:03,700
Estimated mortgage,
343,000.

2788
02:08:03,701 --> 02:08:06,030
Two hundred $95 a month.
Yeah,

2789
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:08,890
that's the house.
Look at that fucking house though.

2790
02:08:09,670 --> 02:08:12,760
That is crazy.
I mean who lives there?

2791
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:16,280
Jay Z does Jay Jay z by that house.
He can buy it.

2792
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:18,010
I bought one for like 80 or something in
Bel Air.

2793
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:19,870
Hollow.
12 bedrooms,

2794
02:08:19,871 --> 02:08:23,680
13 bass.
But that you paid all that money.

2795
02:08:23,681 --> 02:08:25,990
I would have to spend time in my house
all the time.

2796
02:08:25,991 --> 02:08:29,680
I wouldn't go anywhere.
You would feel like that unless you were

2797
02:08:29,681 --> 02:08:32,890
worth billions of dollars.
If you are worth billions of dollars,

2798
02:08:32,891 --> 02:08:35,740
you wouldn't give a fuck at.
They have like a horse if they have a

2799
02:08:35,741 --> 02:08:36,790
heliport.
Oh,

2800
02:08:36,791 --> 02:08:39,070
for sure.
They probably have like a time machine.

2801
02:08:42,450 --> 02:08:46,540
They probably all kinds of crazy shit.
Yeah.

2802
02:08:46,690 --> 02:08:48,910
Nineteen 31.
Wow.

2803
02:08:48,911 --> 02:08:50,620
Well there's a lot of that up there,
you know,

2804
02:08:50,621 --> 02:08:53,830
they built it up there,
that sort of model Italy.

2805
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:57,880
There's a lot of Italians that live up
there and that's why it has an Italian

2806
02:08:57,881 --> 02:09:01,510
name and there's a lot of like really
legit Italian restaurants.

2807
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:02,860
Yeah,
it's the same climate.

2808
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:04,720
Dry,
mountainous on the ocean.

2809
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:06,190
Yeah.
They grow out of wine up there too.

2810
02:09:06,230 --> 02:09:07,270
Yeah,
I was up there.

2811
02:09:07,271 --> 02:09:09,520
I saw Lucille Ball.
She was at a,

2812
02:09:09,521 --> 02:09:11,560
uh,
at a restaurant.

2813
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:15,700
You saw Lucille Ball Shit.
Oh,

2814
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:17,380
I'm sorry.
Carol Burnett now.

2815
02:09:18,020 --> 02:09:20,590
Wendy Lucille ball died.
She died like a long time ago.

2816
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:21,670
Right.
Carol Burnett,

2817
02:09:21,690 --> 02:09:22,690
Carol Carolyn.
That's still alive.

2818
02:09:23,110 --> 02:09:25,480
I saw Carol Burnett.
She's having her little comeback now.

2819
02:09:25,570 --> 02:09:26,260
Fishing.
Well,

2820
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:29,500
they had like the 50th anniversary of
her shell and so they did a big one hour

2821
02:09:29,501 --> 02:09:31,420
special on TV.
That was fucking great.

2822
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:32,970
I watched them.
I Love Lucy.

2823
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,200
The other day I watched him on youtube
and I was like,

2824
02:09:35,201 --> 02:09:36,580
wow.
Or somewhere online.

2825
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:37,541
I was like,
wow,

2826
02:09:37,541 --> 02:09:39,580
this is crazy.
It's such a time machine.

2827
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:41,660
It's such a weird.
Yeah,

2828
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,830
I mean it was so like,
it was like a play.

2829
02:09:44,831 --> 02:09:48,040
I feel like there was one camera just
shooting them flat the whole time.

2830
02:09:48,070 --> 02:09:49,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

2831
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:54,240
Just wide shots of the whole room
critique about like what I think about

2832
02:09:55,061 --> 02:09:59,110
is like how today sitcoms are all
everybody's young and gorgeous and then

2833
02:09:59,111 --> 02:10:03,680
you go back to shows like that and you
go look at the murder cases the fucking

2834
02:10:03,730 --> 02:10:07,000
57 years old.
Back then everybody looked like they

2835
02:10:07,001 --> 02:10:08,290
were all,
even when they weren't.

2836
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:09,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

2837
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:11,910
Look at that.
Look at the Mertz is.

2838
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:14,830
Yeah.
Wow.

2839
02:10:15,970 --> 02:10:20,820
And he was crazy.
Everybody who was Desi Arnaz oh,

2840
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:25,090
how could he not be big star?
It was actually really sad.

2841
02:10:25,091 --> 02:10:29,890
She had a booming career and then she
wanted to spend time with him and get

2842
02:10:29,891 --> 02:10:33,650
him involved.
So they started desi lou productions and

2843
02:10:33,651 --> 02:10:34,010
I think they

2844
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:38,740
were the first talent to create their
own studio for their show.

2845
02:10:38,741 --> 02:10:41,660
So they could own it and so he was,
you know,

2846
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:46,070
he was the executive on the show like
she was and she created this whole world

2847
02:10:46,071 --> 02:10:48,500
for them to be together and then he just
fucked.

2848
02:10:48,650 --> 02:10:53,650
Everybody knows what they did back then.
Especially back then

2849
02:10:54,240 --> 02:10:57,090
probably nobody knew what a star was.
A new thing.

2850
02:10:57,880 --> 02:10:58,170
Right?

2851
02:10:58,170 --> 02:11:00,630
Right.
W Like I played this video yesterday,

2852
02:11:00,631 --> 02:11:04,440
Jamie sent me,
I put it on my instagram of Elvis doing

2853
02:11:04,441 --> 02:11:09,060
karate
and it's a crazy video and you watch

2854
02:11:09,061 --> 02:11:13,800
elvis do this nonsense karate and he's
so obviously pilled out of his mind.

2855
02:11:13,860 --> 02:11:16,050
So obviously high that you're,
what?

2856
02:11:16,051 --> 02:11:18,060
You're watching it,
you're thinking we're not playing this

2857
02:11:18,390 --> 02:11:19,400
right.
What,

2858
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:21,350
when you don't even play the volume,
but what?

2859
02:11:21,410 --> 02:11:24,390
So when you're watching this and Elvis
is going through all this,

2860
02:11:25,290 --> 02:11:30,290
you realized that with this guy was one
of the very first real superstars.

2861
02:11:31,290 --> 02:11:33,170
There was no roadmap.
How,

2862
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:35,580
how this guy learned how to behave.

2863
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:36,493
Yeah.

2864
02:11:37,090 --> 02:11:37,680
I mean,
look at him.

2865
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:39,910
He's smiling high as a kite.
Now check this out.

2866
02:11:40,090 --> 02:11:42,580
Look at this.
Karate stay guys is laying on the

2867
02:11:42,581 --> 02:11:43,930
ground,
stomps on his stomach,

2868
02:11:44,470 --> 02:11:46,150
goes nita belly.
That's legit,

2869
02:11:46,420 --> 02:11:50,260
and look at this clause,
the eyes and the mouth at the same time,

2870
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:52,330
and then they're like,
okay,

2871
02:11:52,331 --> 02:11:52,880
you're done.
He's like,

2872
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:53,960
no,
no man.

2873
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:55,510
I got some.
A little ideas.

2874
02:11:55,540 --> 02:11:56,350
Hold on,
hold on.

2875
02:11:56,350 --> 02:11:57,250
Puts his hand up.
Nope.

2876
02:11:57,560 --> 02:11:58,393
Watches.

2877
02:11:58,490 --> 02:11:59,410
Stay close.
Look at it.

2878
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:01,760
Some cry,
cry moves.

2879
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:05,720
I'm doing all over a bunch of karate
when he does all this crazy karate shit

2880
02:12:05,721 --> 02:12:07,730
and then it helps them up.
You Go,

2881
02:12:08,690 --> 02:12:10,940
I got a bread built better than a black
belt.

2882
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:13,390
Look at this.
The guy throws a punch.

2883
02:12:13,391 --> 02:12:14,950
Steps aside,
I'm going to step to the side.

2884
02:12:14,951 --> 02:12:16,650
Throw a karate kick.
Wow.

2885
02:12:16,810 --> 02:12:19,900
It's disarming things in that video too
that are pretty funny.

2886
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:24,130
Long video.
It's amazing because all my life I had

2887
02:12:24,131 --> 02:12:25,060
always heard.
Yeah,

2888
02:12:25,690 --> 02:12:30,460
Elvis was a black belt under ed parker
because Ed Parker when I was a kid who a

2889
02:12:30,461 --> 02:12:35,320
legitimate karate instructor,
like everybody knew who Ed Parker in Los

2890
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:37,060
Angeles.
Boy,

2891
02:12:37,061 --> 02:12:40,690
that's a good question.
I do not know where he was originally,

2892
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:43,270
but I know he had.
I believe he had places all over the

2893
02:12:43,271 --> 02:12:44,050
country.

2894
02:12:44,050 --> 02:12:44,883
Well,
your guy,

2895
02:12:46,970 --> 02:12:47,730
he grew up,

2896
02:12:47,730 --> 02:12:49,110
he grew up out here.
Yeah,

2897
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:50,080
he.
He went to,

2898
02:12:50,081 --> 02:12:52,050
but I think Ed Parker had a chain,
like.

2899
02:12:52,051 --> 02:12:54,000
Do you remember when we were living in
Boston?

2900
02:12:54,001 --> 02:12:57,180
There was Fred [inaudible].
Do you remember Fred Velardes karate

2901
02:12:57,181 --> 02:12:59,730
studios that Fred Volare selfdefence
studios.

2902
02:12:59,731 --> 02:13:01,170
They were everywhere.
They were everywhere.

2903
02:13:01,171 --> 02:13:03,900
They're all over the place and what
they've basically done is figured out

2904
02:13:03,901 --> 02:13:08,901
how to teach karate in like a digestible
form that families could go to and it

2905
02:13:09,561 --> 02:13:12,960
just became this big business.
But Ed Parker was thought of as like

2906
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:16,380
super legit.
Like that was one of the guys.

2907
02:13:16,381 --> 02:13:20,820
Like there's a few guys,
you know those American karate people.

2908
02:13:20,821 --> 02:13:23,610
There's American martial arts people.
Is Dan Inosanto.

2909
02:13:23,611 --> 02:13:25,680
There was,
you know Bob Wall.

2910
02:13:25,681 --> 02:13:29,220
There was Ed Parker,
like he was a legit guy and I always

2911
02:13:29,221 --> 02:13:31,840
thought that Elvis was legit.
I was.

2912
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:35,370
I'd never seen until that video.
I'd only seen like a couple of things.

2913
02:13:35,370 --> 02:13:39,870
I came on stage throwing kicks and the
punches at the end is the craziest

2914
02:13:39,871 --> 02:13:41,580
because they're nowhere near the guy's
head.

2915
02:13:42,410 --> 02:13:45,000
I lego's hands are taped up to go take
her hands up,

2916
02:13:45,001 --> 02:13:46,650
man.
I'm going to make sure this guy's going

2917
02:13:46,651 --> 02:13:48,510
to throw a kick.
I'm gonna show you go ahead and

2918
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:53,190
try it again.
Look,

2919
02:13:53,210 --> 02:13:56,760
he's got a fucking shirt with a collar
on underneath his karate gate.

2920
02:13:57,270 --> 02:14:01,410
Look at that.
Fucking karate chops up and then walks

2921
02:14:01,411 --> 02:14:02,244
away.
Walk away.

2922
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:04,680
Walk away.
Elvis Presley.

2923
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:07,950
What does it say?
Gladiators project 1974.

2924
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:11,430
Where does God come on out now?
We'll just grab your arm and that guy.

2925
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:14,010
He's like a real karate guys.
Like this is bullshit.

2926
02:14:14,030 --> 02:14:15,370
Look,
he's calling it the hands.

2927
02:14:15,390 --> 02:14:16,860
Oh,
he's a head a head.

2928
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:17,970
Ah,
Yangon.

2929
02:14:18,210 --> 02:14:20,640
Oh elbow man.
I'm getting right here.

2930
02:14:20,980 --> 02:14:23,700
Hit him in the back.
He's like making shit up as he goes

2931
02:14:23,701 --> 02:14:23,970
along.

2932
02:14:23,970 --> 02:14:27,120
I'm all elbow and right elbow.
He's got a gun.

2933
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:28,920
Fuck that gun.
I'm a karate you.

2934
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:33,030
Wow.
But that guy,

2935
02:14:33,570 --> 02:14:37,200
I mean the,
the level of fame that he had achieved

2936
02:14:37,530 --> 02:14:39,720
was unfathomable.
I mean,

2937
02:14:39,721 --> 02:14:40,590
no one,
no one.

2938
02:14:41,010 --> 02:14:45,600
No one had any idea what that was.
And then Michael Jackson fantasy.

2939
02:14:45,601 --> 02:14:48,850
I mean he know marrying.
How old is Priscilla?

2940
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:52,680
14 or that she was very young and just,
Oh,

2941
02:14:52,681 --> 02:14:54,380

My Alma,

2942
02:14:54,410 --> 02:14:56,850

I'm going to get behind them because a

2943
02:14:56,851 --> 02:14:58,620
lot of people lay behind you when
they're attacking you.

2944
02:14:59,310 --> 02:15:01,470
Get behind them.
I'm just ill will in the back.

2945
02:15:01,471 --> 02:15:02,650
Okay.
I'll come out your with Doug.

2946
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:05,730
Palm strike to the head.
Try to get me with a gun.

2947
02:15:06,270 --> 02:15:09,060
Good look.
Good luck on pills.

2948
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:13,950
He was on pills for a long time.
He's on pills right now.

2949
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:15,750
Look at that.
Look at this.

2950
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:17,720
Come over here.
He's got a gun.

2951
02:15:17,820 --> 02:15:18,890
But uh,
I don't give a fuck.

2952
02:15:18,891 --> 02:15:21,720
[inaudible] they're gonna gum up my hand
and he's going to stay put.

2953
02:15:22,260 --> 02:15:24,660
I'll get my hand.
Come on.

2954
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:27,450
Peanut burn blendle sandwich.
There's no way.

2955
02:15:27,451 --> 02:15:29,400
He didn't accidentally punched those
guys in the face.

2956
02:15:29,401 --> 02:15:32,720
Constantly going probably to it.
They're probably mad at him.

2957
02:15:33,630 --> 02:15:37,350
Just kept taking it.
Well that's the thing about like karate,

2958
02:15:37,380 --> 02:15:41,340
there was,
there's always been bullshit karate back

2959
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:44,250
black belts and they can kind of get
away with it because most of the time

2960
02:15:44,251 --> 02:15:48,660
you don't really spar and when you do
spar you kind of like take it light and

2961
02:15:48,661 --> 02:15:49,271
you're like,
ah,

2962
02:15:49,271 --> 02:15:52,110
I could have got you right there.
Like you do a bunch of that stuff.

2963
02:15:52,111 --> 02:15:54,180
Like I always saw a lot of that.
He can't,

2964
02:15:54,210 --> 02:15:57,900
that doesn't happen with Jujitsu.
Jujitsu because you can kind of do it

2965
02:15:57,901 --> 02:15:58,650
full blast.

2966
02:15:58,650 --> 02:16:00,750
Like karate can't really.
You can,

2967
02:16:00,780 --> 02:16:03,630
but it's not,
it's not wise and you can't do it very

2968
02:16:03,631 --> 02:16:04,710
long.
If you full blast,

2969
02:16:04,711 --> 02:16:07,590
punch and kick each other,
you wind up hurting everybody.

2970
02:16:07,591 --> 02:16:08,910
Everybody's going to get fucked up.
Right.

2971
02:16:08,911 --> 02:16:10,490
Including you,
um,

2972
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:11,353
because you're,
you're,

2973
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:13,680
you would be fighting like fist fighting
all the time.

2974
02:16:13,710 --> 02:16:17,370
But with Jujitsu,
because of the fact that you roll,

2975
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:20,070
meaning you spar,
but that sparring does not involve

2976
02:16:20,071 --> 02:16:22,860
striking and you could tap out when
you're in a bad position,

2977
02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:26,670
you could literally go full blast.
So you really find out people that are

2978
02:16:26,671 --> 02:16:27,870
good.
So there's very,

2979
02:16:27,871 --> 02:16:30,430
very few fake Jujitsu,

2980
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:34,060
black belts,
but occasionally there are some and they

2981
02:16:34,061 --> 02:16:38,950
get outdated and there's some hilarious
videos online of guys getting arrested.

2982
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:41,110
Where does Steven Seagal fall on that
line?

2983
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:45,970
He is a legitimate I quito black belt.
In fact,

2984
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:50,770
he was an instructor,
one of the very first Americans to teach

2985
02:16:50,771 --> 02:16:54,550
at a Dojo in Japan.
So Steven Seagal.

2986
02:16:54,850 --> 02:16:59,560
But the martial art is the questionable
thing.

2987
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:04,680
It's the martial art of ICO is it's
really a martial art that was created to

2988
02:17:04,901 --> 02:17:09,190
disarm people with swords.
The idea was that you lost your sword in

2989
02:17:09,191 --> 02:17:11,860
combat and someone was coming at you
with a sword.

2990
02:17:12,340 --> 02:17:16,540
Last ditch effort is you had to be able
to use someone's momentum against them.

2991
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:18,970
You gotta be able to use.
Some guy comes at you with a sword.

2992
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:23,350
You have to be very adept at catching
their arm and flipping them over.

2993
02:17:23,351 --> 02:17:23,880
Here's the goal.

2994
02:17:23,880 --> 02:17:25,000
It's very subtle,
right?

2995
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:27,740
Let's.
Let's not use this because it's.

2996
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:30,340
It's easy to poke fun at him when he's
old,

2997
02:17:30,341 --> 02:17:31,870
but let's go to that black and white
one.

2998
02:17:32,350 --> 02:17:34,570
See that black and white one down there.
Go to that.

2999
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:36,490
If you go back.
See that one right there.

3000
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:38,230
Steven Seagal.
Go to that one.

3001
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:41,740
Now.
There's some some footage of him when he

3002
02:17:41,741 --> 02:17:42,491
was young.
Yeah.

3003
02:17:42,491 --> 02:17:45,370
This is go fullscreen.
He is legit.

3004
02:17:45,540 --> 02:17:48,880
He is very legit and he was thin.
It was a different thing,

3005
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:54,420
but the thing is nobody comes at you
like this and a fucking ncaa wrestler

3006
02:17:56,441 --> 02:18:01,150
would shoot a double on him and take him
down faster than you can possibly

3007
02:18:01,151 --> 02:18:01,721
imagine.
I mean,

3008
02:18:01,721 --> 02:18:03,910
this does not work.
It's a dance.

3009
02:18:03,970 --> 02:18:04,900
Well,
it works.

3010
02:18:06,610 --> 02:18:08,950
It works.
If someone does know what they're doing

3011
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:11,170
or if you have a lot of physical
attributes,

3012
02:18:11,171 --> 02:18:12,580
like Seagal is a huge guy.

3013
02:18:12,580 --> 02:18:17,200
He's a very big guy and he probably
could pull that off on a lot of people

3014
02:18:17,201 --> 02:18:20,920
who don't know how to fight and I hear
this is what it was about.

3015
02:18:21,190 --> 02:18:23,140
What I.
Quito is really bad.

3016
02:18:23,141 --> 02:18:24,850
This is Kendo though.
They're using swords,

3017
02:18:24,851 --> 02:18:26,600
which maybe they do use some of that.
Nikita.

3018
02:18:26,620 --> 02:18:29,950
Quito,
but would Akita was originally created

3019
02:18:29,951 --> 02:18:31,300
for,
I hope I'm not mistaken,

3020
02:18:31,570 --> 02:18:35,110
was learning how to disarm like that.
The guy comes out and with a knife and

3021
02:18:35,111 --> 02:18:36,730
he flips the guy and takes the knife
away.

3022
02:18:37,060 --> 02:18:39,160
He's using the guy's energy against
them.

3023
02:18:39,250 --> 02:18:42,100
That was the original intention of I
Quito,

3024
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:46,780
but in terms of Japanese martial arts,
I was never thought of as the most

3025
02:18:46,781 --> 02:18:51,781
effective judo is far more effective
because judo involves people grabbing

3026
02:18:53,291 --> 02:18:56,380
people and flipping them and slamming
them on the ground.

3027
02:18:56,590 --> 02:19:00,670
Like there's a great video of an old
judo master.

3028
02:19:00,790 --> 02:19:03,580
See if you can find this video.
There's this guy he looks like he's

3029
02:19:03,581 --> 02:19:08,110
about 80 years old and he weighs about
13 pounds and he is lit.

3030
02:19:08,170 --> 02:19:10,960
You can tell,
especially someone who knows martial

3031
02:19:10,961 --> 02:19:12,310
arts.
You can tell when someone's just giving

3032
02:19:12,311 --> 02:19:15,820
in the problem with a lot of these
demonstrations by Ketos guys are just

3033
02:19:15,821 --> 02:19:18,460
giving in like this old dude watch this
old dude.

3034
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:22,360
The old dude in the right hand side is
so much bigger than the other guy and

3035
02:19:22,361 --> 02:19:25,820
they're walking the guy around and like,
he's really throwing this guy right?

3036
02:19:26,020 --> 02:19:28,250
This is legit.
Like this is trying

3037
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:30,440
not to get thrown and he doesn't know
what to do.

3038
02:19:30,530 --> 02:19:34,820
Like trips him to the ground there,
but this old guy is tiny,

3039
02:19:34,970 --> 02:19:39,200
but he's using perfect leverage and
perfect technique and fuck.

3040
02:19:39,201 --> 02:19:42,950
He looks really old in this picture,
like the guys trying to throw him there

3041
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:47,210
and he can't pull it off and he can't
pull it off because the older guy has

3042
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:50,270
perfect position and perfectly.
What is the name of this video?

3043
02:19:50,550 --> 02:19:50,920
Perfect

3044
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:51,753
leverage.
Look at this

3045
02:19:52,820 --> 02:19:55,310
nine years old.
Judo master is the name of the video

3046
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:57,200
online and I don't know if he was really
90,

3047
02:19:57,230 --> 02:19:59,420
but he certainly looks like it could be
90,

3048
02:19:59,690 --> 02:20:03,140
but this old guy just knows how to
notice.

3049
02:20:03,141 --> 02:20:06,560
Also the back of his heels are always
like lifting up.

3050
02:20:06,561 --> 02:20:10,310
He's moving.
This guy's trying to throw him and he's

3051
02:20:10,311 --> 02:20:12,350
just.
And the guy who's trying to throw him

3052
02:20:12,351 --> 02:20:14,930
appears to be a black belt.
At least he's wearing a black belt.

3053
02:20:15,170 --> 02:20:18,890
Fucking incredible men.
It's really amazing.

3054
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:23,800
So judo was a much more effective
martial art and judo was actually what

3055
02:20:23,810 --> 02:20:26,600
was taught to the Brazilians.
Um,

3056
02:20:26,810 --> 02:20:30,460
when count my ada went to Brazil and,
uh,

3057
02:20:30,590 --> 02:20:33,120
taught people in Brazil,
Peru,

3058
02:20:33,620 --> 02:20:36,680
particularly the gracies,
they taught them Brazilian Jujitsu.

3059
02:20:37,070 --> 02:20:42,070
The gracies took what was judo at the
time and they took the ground attacks of

3060
02:20:42,291 --> 02:20:47,090
judo and just perfected them and then
hone them and changed them and made them

3061
02:20:47,091 --> 02:20:52,091
more technical and really worked on
utilizing leverage and utilizing

3062
02:20:52,461 --> 02:20:56,450
submissions and they,
they turned that into Brazilian Jujitsu.

3063
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:59,410
So judo is standing as well as ground?
Yes.

3064
02:20:59,670 --> 02:21:02,250
There's a ground aspect of judo
obviously,

3065
02:21:02,251 --> 02:21:05,310
like Ronda Rousey is probably one of the
most famous submission artists in the

3066
02:21:05,311 --> 02:21:07,110
UFC.
And her background was in judo.

3067
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:09,720
She was a judo player and very good at
judo.

3068
02:21:09,721 --> 02:21:12,690
She was a bronze medalist,
so when she would get ahold of people,

3069
02:21:12,691 --> 02:21:15,870
she would just fucking throw 'em on
their ass and flip them and toss them

3070
02:21:15,871 --> 02:21:19,650
and slammed to the ground.
She just had phenomenal judo but also a

3071
02:21:19,651 --> 02:21:23,580
wicked arm bar.
And that was because the Ne Waza the

3072
02:21:23,610 --> 02:21:27,330
ground attack version.
Part of Jujitsu comes from judo.

3073
02:21:28,290 --> 02:21:29,123
So there you go.

3074
02:21:29,530 --> 02:21:31,600
Yeah.
My father did judo and he taught it to

3075
02:21:31,601 --> 02:21:35,080
me and my brother and then I remember my
brother was bigger than me and he used

3076
02:21:35,081 --> 02:21:39,220
to flip the fuck out and then he did it
to me one day and my father grabbed him

3077
02:21:39,221 --> 02:21:40,830
and flipped him down on the ground
because like,

3078
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:45,300
this is not good.
This is isn't like passing on knowledge.

3079
02:21:45,380 --> 02:21:49,390
This is just a violent family.
Added control was dead drunk.

3080
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:52,120
He was six foot two cigarette in his
hand.

3081
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:53,710
My cigarette.
Yeah.

3082
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,380
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

3083
02:21:56,381 --> 02:21:59,010
Judo is legit.
Judah is way more legit than a kito.

3084
02:21:59,060 --> 02:22:00,340
Something like does not legit.

3085
02:22:01,210 --> 02:22:03,420
I was like,
it's a lot of pressure points and

3086
02:22:03,421 --> 02:22:05,780
holding the wrist in different ways.
Yeah,

3087
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:09,940
yeah.
Most of it is throws and learning how to

3088
02:22:09,941 --> 02:22:13,750
take an attack or like if you just
charge forward and an Aikido guy and you

3089
02:22:13,751 --> 02:22:16,770
have your,
your right hand come on like cocked and

3090
02:22:16,780 --> 02:22:18,370
ready and just run out of it.
Throw that punch.

3091
02:22:18,970 --> 02:22:21,010
A really good Akita.
I was going to grab that and flip you

3092
02:22:21,011 --> 02:22:23,980
and slammed me on the ground,
but you know,

3093
02:22:24,070 --> 02:22:26,190
how often does that come up?
Most,

3094
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:29,640
especially today when people actually
know how to fight,

3095
02:22:30,130 --> 02:22:31,090
it's just the,
it's,

3096
02:22:31,180 --> 02:22:33,870
it's too limited,
but there's a lot of martial arts like

3097
02:22:33,871 --> 02:22:36,060
that.
Like there are certain aspects of karate

3098
02:22:36,061 --> 02:22:38,490
that are applicable,
but there's a lot of it that's really

3099
02:22:38,491 --> 02:22:39,630
limited,
you know,

3100
02:22:39,631 --> 02:22:42,830
and it's just,
if you're going to teach your daughters

3101
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:44,640
like,
my daughter is 14 and I'd love for her

3102
02:22:44,641 --> 02:22:48,510
to get into some martial arts,
what would be the most effective Jujitsu

3103
02:22:48,511 --> 02:22:49,940
selfdefence,
Jujitsu,

3104
02:22:50,050 --> 02:22:51,150
100 percent,
100 percent.

3105
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:53,250
Because with Jujitsu,
uh,

3106
02:22:53,251 --> 02:22:55,740
first of all,
you use a lot of your legs and a girl

3107
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:58,200
has strong legs.
Your bodies,

3108
02:22:58,370 --> 02:23:00,150
you're carrying your body run all the
time with your legs.

3109
02:23:00,350 --> 02:23:03,330
You can catch a guy in a triangle or an
arm bar and break his arm or choke them

3110
02:23:03,340 --> 02:23:04,910
asleep with your legs.
I mean,

3111
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:09,120
there's a lot of girls that would fuck a
lot of guys up on the ground just by

3112
02:23:09,121 --> 02:23:11,080
using armbars and leg locks and things
on.

3113
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:16,100
Because an Armbar is your whole body
against someone's arm or a triangle is

3114
02:23:17,161 --> 02:23:19,800
your whole body,
particularly your lower body,

3115
02:23:19,801 --> 02:23:23,580
but you're using your upper body to pull
down the head against the guy's neck and

3116
02:23:23,581 --> 02:23:26,220
arms,
so you're squashing the neck and the

3117
02:23:26,221 --> 02:23:28,230
arms together and then you're pulling
down to head.

3118
02:23:28,650 --> 02:23:31,650
A girl could absolutely put a guy,
a girl can put me to sleep.

3119
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:35,370
A girl's got a good triangle.
It was like a legit black belt and I get

3120
02:23:35,371 --> 02:23:37,470
caught in a triangle.
I will have to tap out,

3121
02:23:37,471 --> 02:23:38,304
man.
Yeah,

3122
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:41,130
fact.
You know legs are strong men.

3123
02:23:41,180 --> 02:23:42,840
Yeah.
Think about what you do with your legs.

3124
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:45,930
You know you can't.
How long can you walk in your hands?

3125
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:46,530
I mean,
who?

3126
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:47,670
Who?
What's the world record for?

3127
02:23:47,671 --> 02:23:50,000
Walking on your hands.
So like an hour.

3128
02:23:50,870 --> 02:23:54,780
How long if you walked to Disneyland?
I mean,

3129
02:23:54,781 --> 02:23:57,120
it's fucking your hours and hours on
your feet.

3130
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:59,010
All right.
No problem at all.

3131
02:23:59,090 --> 02:24:01,320
All right.
What's the world record guy walked in

3132
02:24:01,321 --> 02:24:03,420
his sand?
A woman actually did it.

3133
02:24:03,421 --> 02:24:06,330
Five thousand meters and eight hours.
Whoa.

3134
02:24:06,340 --> 02:24:08,250
Damn.
She's a savage.

3135
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:12,210
Five thousand meters.
What's that in American

3136
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:17,790
in 13,400 feet.
How many hours?

3137
02:24:18,190 --> 02:24:19,560
Eight.
How did she eat?

3138
02:24:19,970 --> 02:24:21,560
How do you eat upside down?
Just didn't.

3139
02:24:21,590 --> 02:24:23,070
Each took.
Took eight hours off.

3140
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:24,080
Eat.
Fuck.

3141
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:25,830
Can't do it.
Can take it out.

3142
02:24:26,430 --> 02:24:30,450
I did gymnastics for like six years and
I could walk like a motherfucker on your

3143
02:24:30,451 --> 02:24:32,240
hands.
I can still walk on my hands and you

3144
02:24:32,241 --> 02:24:33,630
really.
I don't know what the risk now.

3145
02:24:33,631 --> 02:24:35,700
Who knows?
But like I could literally,

3146
02:24:35,701 --> 02:24:38,580
I would walk around the house on my
hands when I was a kid.

3147
02:24:39,540 --> 02:24:42,030
It's a cool skill to have.
It looks cool.

3148
02:24:42,300 --> 02:24:47,300
Backflips to back to standing back flips
that Jesus Christ record for defending

3149
02:24:48,721 --> 02:24:51,780
50 stairs.
Jesus Christ on your hands.

3150
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:55,260
Did it in 14 seconds.
Fourteen seconds.

3151
02:24:55,590 --> 02:24:58,680
Look at this fucking savage.
He's got some pads on his hands,

3152
02:24:58,830 --> 02:25:03,090
but he's guards.
He's walking down those stairs like he's

3153
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:05,490
on his hand on his feet.
Look at that.

3154
02:25:05,491 --> 02:25:06,810
That's crazy.
That's amazing.

3155
02:25:07,260 --> 02:25:10,250
Wow.
That's bounce.

3156
02:25:11,290 --> 02:25:13,230
These Asian,
they're not regular white people,

3157
02:25:13,231 --> 02:25:14,550
right?
Russians.

3158
02:25:14,551 --> 02:25:16,320
They're stronger.
Fuck Ya.

3159
02:25:16,460 --> 02:25:18,300
If you think about that part of the
world,

3160
02:25:18,301 --> 02:25:21,210
man,
that's a fascinating part of the world.

3161
02:25:22,190 --> 02:25:23,350
Have tough.
You have to be.

3162
02:25:23,410 --> 02:25:24,243
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3163
02:25:24,310 --> 02:25:27,310
Siberia and Shit.
Now those Russians,

3164
02:25:27,311 --> 02:25:30,580
gang gangs came to New York.
It was like a whole new world of

3165
02:25:30,581 --> 02:25:33,730
organized crime.
Like much more hardcore

3166
02:25:35,290 --> 02:25:37,870
Italians.
You think about like the old gangs,

3167
02:25:37,871 --> 02:25:41,380
like the mafia guys now they seem like
kind of soft and cuddly.

3168
02:25:41,540 --> 02:25:44,140
Like a godfather.
The Godfather,

3169
02:25:44,740 --> 02:25:47,290
but these Russian guys,
let's just still fucking cut your

3170
02:25:47,291 --> 02:25:50,440
Achilles tendon out because you own 10
bucks.

3171
02:25:51,030 --> 02:25:53,860
Happened to me once.
Somebody cut your Achilles tendon.

3172
02:25:54,970 --> 02:25:55,803
No,
no.

3173
02:25:56,950 --> 02:26:00,760
I knew you were faking because you had
the hint of a joke in your face.

3174
02:26:00,761 --> 02:26:02,020
But part of me was like,
really?

3175
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:05,980
What you want to told me that already,
but I just remember seeing these.

3176
02:26:05,981 --> 02:26:07,210
These Russian guys,
they just,

3177
02:26:07,270 --> 02:26:10,120
they look hard.
They've just been out in the cold.

3178
02:26:10,121 --> 02:26:13,030
Their whole lives.
Women to heart.

3179
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:16,600
Beautiful,
powerful genetics.

3180
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:19,180
Yeah.
That lost a shit ton of men in the wars,

3181
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:20,500
right?
You know?

3182
02:26:21,700 --> 02:26:23,930
Yeah.
How many Russian soldiers died in World

3183
02:26:23,930 --> 02:26:24,763
War II?
Millions.

3184
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:26,860
Millions.
Millions.

3185
02:26:26,950 --> 02:26:28,060
Millions.
Starved to death.

3186
02:26:28,061 --> 02:26:29,080
Apparently,
yeah,

3187
02:26:30,030 --> 02:26:31,570
yeah.
It's just a hard part of the world,

3188
02:26:31,571 --> 02:26:33,460
man.
Not like la today.

3189
02:26:33,461 --> 02:26:35,470
It was 50 degrees people like,
oh my God,

3190
02:26:35,471 --> 02:26:37,850
it's so cold.
I got,

3191
02:26:38,490 --> 02:26:41,580
I got a winter coat in the car running
today and uh,

3192
02:26:41,590 --> 02:26:43,030
I ran into my friend.
She,

3193
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:44,200
uh,
one of my neighbors,

3194
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:49,320
she had gloves on and a sock hat and
like a,

3195
02:26:49,711 --> 02:26:51,240
a fucking one of those.

3196
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:53,440
Uh,
what are those fucking Patagonia,

3197
02:26:53,510 --> 02:26:56,620
like puffy jackets?
I geared my daughter,

3198
02:26:56,621 --> 02:26:57,550
you know,
she serves.

3199
02:26:57,580 --> 02:27:00,360
She was out six in the morning.
She was in the ocean this morning.

3200
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,700
Damn,
that's core that you raised some

3201
02:27:03,701 --> 02:27:04,720
hardcore kids,
dude.

3202
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:06,640
Yeah,
she does it year round or an animal?

3203
02:27:06,670 --> 02:27:08,230
Yeah.
Tougher than me.

3204
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:10,330
Both deafer than me.
That's amazing.

3205
02:27:10,810 --> 02:27:11,920
Congratulations.
Yeah,

3206
02:27:11,921 --> 02:27:15,310
she's a bad ass.
