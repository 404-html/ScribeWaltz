1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,190
If you're going to,

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,070
I've never told this story and I haven't
told the story because it's a scary

4
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:05,370
one.

5
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:05,820
Um,

6
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,830
I've never told this story before,

7
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,501
but I'm going to tell you,

8
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:08,340
you don't know the story of Joe.

9
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,390
Um,

10
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,390
last summer I went to south of France
and I was with my wife and my buddy and

11
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:17,341
he,

12
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,210
the first day were there.

13
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:18,661
He goes,

14
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:19,770
we're going to go cliff diving.

15
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,150
And I said,

16
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,630
hmm,

17
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,650
I don't like that idea.

18
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,520
Okay.

19
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,510
It's a group of people.

20
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,480
One guy's the best horseback
rider in the world,

21
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:28,470
whatever random stuff.

22
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,850
So we get there and do,

23
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,940
we get there and we're up there and it's,

24
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,330
it's,

25
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:32,640
it's,

26
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,560
it's the ocean number one.

27
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,461
Number two,

28
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:36,630
it's craggy rocks.

29
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,141
Number three,

30
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:37,831
it's very high.

31
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:38,521
And number four,

32
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:39,354
it's cold.

33
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,190
So I look over and my instincts and I go,

34
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,530
so if we jump,

35
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,810
where are we supposed to swim too?

36
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,940
And the surfer,

37
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:48,900
who was from there,

38
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,250
I said over there,

39
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:53,760
but I don't like the way the tide
is washing up on those rocks.

40
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,370
So I go,

41
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:55,740
hmm,

42
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,580
that's all I had to here.

43
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,240
Not going to do it.

44
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,073
Prosing cons,

45
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,913
not going to do it.

46
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,870
The horseback rider jumps his,

47
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,360
his chubby girl jumps
and guess who else jumps?

48
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,373
My wife,

49
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,280
mother of my children,

50
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,420
she just goes,

51
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,880
she's talked about it,

52
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:08,311
but she's like,

53
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:09,780
I'm doing this to competitive chick.

54
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,320
She goes,

55
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,471
oh,

56
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:11,220
that girl's going to do it.

57
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,053
I'm doing it.

58
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,740
So that's my,

59
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,910
that's the mother of my children.

60
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,780
So guess what?

61
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,520
I got to go in and make sure she's okay.

62
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,130
So I jumped in and you're scared shitless.

63
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,600
I wasn't scared about jumping.

64
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,434
I was mad.

65
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,360
I was mad because I don't like the ocean.

66
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:29,760
I was mad because I didn't
have a good instinct about it.

67
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,220
I was mad because I don't know that area.

68
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:34,160
And the mother and children decides to,

69
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,640
doesn't really mad about they see your,

70
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,001
I said,

71
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:36,781
fuck these kids.

72
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:37,471
I'm going to jump into this.

73
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,011
Rochelle.

74
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:40,800
My wife is brutally competitive and
she's not going to let somebody won.

75
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,491
So,

76
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,390
so what?

77
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,051
Right.

78
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,040
That's ridiculous.

79
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:48,330
Now I jump in and I know you and I are
the same mind because your cost is like

80
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:48,631
this too.

81
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:50,700
I jump in and I,

82
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,043
I swim,

83
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,890
we swim and now we have to go up on the
rocks and the waves are hitting these

84
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:56,610
rocks.

85
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,000
So I said to Amanda,

86
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,410
I go,

87
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,320
we're going to have to ride
this wave onto these rocks.

88
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,440
Let me go first so I can
turn around and pick,

89
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,040
grab you.

90
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,873
No big deal.

91
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,620
I go and as I go and turn around,

92
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,070
I get hit with a second wave with
which just came out of nowhere.

93
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,350
It,

94
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,780
it,

95
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,670
it literally knocks me,

96
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,730
rolls me on this really sharp coral.

97
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,593
So my feet,

98
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,381
my hands,

99
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:23,580
everything's all full of blood.

100
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,900
My waist,

101
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,381
my waist,

102
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,760
legs are all full of blood.

103
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,470
She starts to kind of panic.

104
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:31,140
She goes and like that
and the ways and stuff.

105
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,680
Cause I got the wind knocked out of
me and I'm telling you right now,

106
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:34,870
I,

107
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,300
I grabbed her and she goes,

108
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:36,811
get away from me.

109
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:41,610
She thought I was going to drown her
so I have to [inaudible] well she just

110
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:42,090
didn't want it.

111
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,541
She didn't tell.

112
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,540
She thought I was gonna bring her down.

113
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,180
So just so I have to calm her down.

114
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,000
So it gets so bad cause I can't grab her.

115
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,920
I tried to get her back
up on the rocks again.

116
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,060
Washed off again.

117
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,373
Okay,

118
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,423
so now,

119
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,560
now I'm swollen with seawater.

120
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,110
She's swollen seawater and,

121
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:57,470
and,

122
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,303
and I'm literally,

123
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,470
I'm literally talking to me like this,

124
00:02:59,471 --> 00:02:59,610
like go.

125
00:02:59,610 --> 00:02:59,861
All right,

126
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:00,281
no big deal.

127
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:00,800
We're just going to,

128
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,900
we're not going to stay here.

129
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,130
Let's relax.

130
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,550
Let's just swim further out so
we can get used to these waves.

131
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,930
Let's wait until it calms down.

132
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:08,950
It's crisis mode,

133
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,533
crisis.

134
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,550
It's crisis mode.

135
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,380
And I realize that I'm panicked and I
don't really actually have the strength.

136
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,520
I'm worried that I'm going to go,

137
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,300
I'm trying to,

138
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,890
I got to hold her up because she's,

139
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,380
she's strong and I think,

140
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:23,601
and I,

141
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:25,270
and I think I've got to get behind her,

142
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,910
but she's literally pushing me away.

143
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,640
Now she grabs onto me and now I'm like,

144
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,180
oh boy,

145
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,180
I gotta I gotta get it together here
because she's holding onto me and kind of

146
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:38,260
pulling me under the dude who's
the surfer sees what's going on.

147
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,090
He dives in,

148
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,890
he grabs her.

149
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,731
I literally,

150
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,600
I'm holding her.

151
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,010
He comes up and I go take her,

152
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,570
take her like really calm.

153
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,220
I go take her cause she's panicking.

154
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,803
He grabs her,

155
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,230
he ends up having to put her on top of
him and he lets the wave ride them up.

156
00:03:56,321 --> 00:04:00,660
He gets his whole back and legs
ripped up and he pulls her on shore.

157
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:01,540
So she's a bloody mess.

158
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,420
I ride the next wave in my feet,

159
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,230
my hands,

160
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:05,861
my body.

161
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:06,850
I'm all ripped up.

162
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm all ripped up for the rest of the v.

163
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,160
The vacation never been more
angry so bad by the way,

164
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:17,161
that the helicopter that the rescue
helicopter shows up and and people all

165
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,410
crowded around like where
they saw everything happened.

166
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:22,270
Then I'm full of blood and
we're all full of blood.

167
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,280
The rescue helicopter comes up,

168
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,061
which is by the way,

169
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:26,950
some $20,000 fine or something.

170
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,090
We,

171
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,130
I grab Amanda,

172
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:29,770
I grab my,

173
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,910
grab my friends,

174
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:31,121
I go,

175
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:32,050
let's get in the car.

176
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,140
Now they're going to equate the,

177
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,230
they think of the catches
and figure out it's us.

178
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,390
So we jumped in the car and drive off.

179
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,030
That was the scariest I,

180
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,700
what I realized there was that
the sea can take you so quickly,

181
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,690
you just go to the bottom.

182
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:44,291
Then I find them,

183
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,310
you will see you later love.

184
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:49,180
And that should happens all
the time because people are,

185
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:50,320
if you don't know how to ride,

186
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,341
you know,

187
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,510
currents and waves,

188
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:53,380
if you're not used to it,

189
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:54,250
if you know a good swimmer,

190
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,413
swimmer,

191
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,413
lose your life.

192
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,701
Yeah,

193
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:58,570
and I am a good swimmer.

194
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,440
You know what I thought about?

195
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,760
You know what's crazy to me,

196
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:01,360
into your family.

197
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,193
Think about me.

198
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,360
I thought about my kids
getting without their mom.

199
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:05,194
I wasn't going back without,

200
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:05,921
without their mom.

201
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:06,754
I wasn't going to happen.

202
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,100
And that's way scarier
than me losing my life.

203
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,480
I never had that expression.

204
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:11,590
If you didn't jump in,

205
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,390
well that's exactly.

206
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,720
Imagine if you didn't.

207
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,520
Exactly.

208
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,020
That's why they should suffer.

209
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,760
But it sounds like there was a lot of
space between a lot for jumping in and a

210
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:23,470
surfer and the surfer in,

211
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,460
Oh my God,

212
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,600
he didn't know we were in trouble.

213
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,740
Oh my God.

214
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,360
That's why I jumped in.

215
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,400
And that's why you see
the big fight after,

216
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,271
you know,

217
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:32,720
it was so scary.

218
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,091
That was thankful.

219
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:34,421
She was,

220
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:34,600
uh,

221
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,433
she was okay.

222
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:35,980
Whew.

223
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,240
That was a bad situation.

224
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,490
I don't even like telling
a story cause it was cause,

225
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,700
cause of the feeling it gave
me like I didn't feel you.

226
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,320
It's not good to feel that
vulnerable to see is a scary bitch.

227
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,283
The scheme.

228
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,780
I don't fuck around.

229
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,613
I love the ocean.

230
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,630
My buddy who says
something that's not fun.

231
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,830
My buddy used to have to take,

232
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,190
uh,

233
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:54,521
he would,

234
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:59,521
he would make his money by sailing boats
in the winter for rich people up the

235
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:00,351
Atlantic,

236
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:02,510
which doubled during
storm season sailboats.

237
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,940
And he was only one of the
few people willing to do that.

238
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,690
And ice,

239
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,240
he got caught in a storm for 23 hours
or the swells were going over his body.

240
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,561
They couldn't,

241
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:17,120
they had to literally fly a guy from
Alaska in a special boat cause nobody else

242
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:17,571
could do it,

243
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:21,710
could navigate the storm who tugged him
in and he strapped himself and he was

244
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:26,060
getting hypothermia as the water and
he couldn't see the waves at night.

245
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:29,240
He had to wait to hear them because they
would just come over the boat and the

246
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,410
whole boat would submerge.

247
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,901
Oh,

248
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:31,734
that happened.

249
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,620
That happened for him.

250
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:35,540
That happened for about 10 hours.

251
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,390
Just kept some merging and they were out.

252
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,060
He keeps [inaudible] from cap and you've
got to steer you towards the weight.

253
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,050
You've got to be an expert.

254
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,940
And he was so,

255
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,440
so,

256
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:44,690
uh,

257
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,720
they were stuck out there and you're at
the mercy of the C and a lot of times

258
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,490
you just get washed up
on rocks and you die.

259
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,630
So we had to keep the rocks.

260
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,500
He got to keep away from the
rocks and he had to keep the boat.

261
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,240
He had to deal with these insane waves
at night where you can't see them.

262
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,140
Nature's another love rocks and the
water and the water got a simultaneously

263
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:03,780
worry about bolts.

264
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,310
Sounds right.

265
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,290
And you're in a metal boat for 10 hours.

266
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,430
It's a wood boat.

267
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,260
It's a word blood.

268
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,450
Yeah.

269
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,283
It's a wood boat.

270
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,870
It's a sailboat.

271
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,091
Oh,

272
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:11,750
a sale.

273
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,240
You can keep that shit
keyed that ocean shit.

274
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,021
And I said to him,

275
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:15,650
I said,

276
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,101
do you ever,

277
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:16,700
what kind of a,

278
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,570
would you have a life vest?

279
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:17,901
He goes,

280
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:18,734
you don't wear a life vest.

281
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,230
I Wa I.

282
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,611
What do you mean?

283
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:20,270
He goes,

284
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,720
you look,

285
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,950
if you get knocked over,

286
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,730
you're dying.

287
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,091
You guys,

288
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:26,420
and and chances are life that is going
to keep you cold and alive longer than

289
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:27,254
you want to be.

290
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,150
You're not even,

291
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,800
they can,

292
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,000
they can't come back and find you because
they can't get you out back on the

293
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:32,271
boat.

294
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:33,680
They camp in that kind of weather.

295
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:34,880
You're probably injured anyway.

296
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,290
Now those guys are hardcore.

297
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,760
Keep it,

298
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,700
keep being humbled.

299
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,510
That fucking deadliest catch
show you ever watched that show?

300
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,310
Those guys are up there just catching
it tracks how much don't delicious could

301
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:49,490
crabs be because somebody decided that
this is what they wanted to do with their

302
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:49,760
time.

303
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,750
If you fall in that water,

304
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,810
you got about two minutes before
you have for your dead hypothermia.

305
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,663
Yeah.

306
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,250
Yeah.
