1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,000
Do we have enough left for tomorrow?
We don't have tomorrow.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,280
I'll bring the sweet

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,630
Ben Shapiro.
We are live.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,060
The people have spoken.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:11,890
Well,
thank you for having me.

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,210
Thanks for being here,
man.

7
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,820
I became a fan of yours when I watched 
you.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,580
Um,
uh,

9
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,480
with what the fuck is his name?
The CNN asshole.

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Piers Morgan.
That was glorious when you went after 

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,020
him with the sandy hook thing,
like right away.

12
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:27,420
Immediately,
like a,

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,460
it was just glorious and you could tell 
that he didn't know what to do with it 

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:32,860
and he literally said,
how dare you,

15
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,010
which is what I say to people all the 
time when I'm joking you was one of my 

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,250
friends had it looked like he was 
clutching his pearls.

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,130
He was really pissed.
He was really good.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,830
It was a two segment interview and 
during the break I said to him,

19
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:46,630
thanks so much for having me on any kind
of growled at me.

20
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,610
He was not a happy camper.
He.

21
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,410
Yeah.
Well you crushed him.

22
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,410
And the other,
one of my other favorite ones was 

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:55,840
Chelsea handler crushing him where she 
was literally talking like,

24
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:57,850
you don't even talk to me in the break 
and the break.

25
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:00,400
You're checking your phone and checking 
twitter and,

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,720
and he,
you could tell he was like,

27
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,780
oh no,
he just came from that Weird British 

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,471
tabloid environment and you found out 
that the company that he worked for did 

29
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:11,910
really creepy shit.
Like check people's voicemails.

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,850
They hacked into people's people who are
dead and they gave the family false hope

31
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:20,851
because they had checked the voicemail 
and they found out that someone checked 

32
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:20,851
in,
they thought,

33
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:21,010
oh,
maybe she's still alive.

34
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,130
And then we made him a host on like the 
x factor.

35
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,970
I brought him on.
CNN is awesome.

36
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,140
I just don't make any decisions on,
around why CNN thought that we have this

37
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,180
fascination with British people.

38
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,550
Yes.
If you have a British accent,

39
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,350
we automatically add 20 points here.
Icu.

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,660
Yeah.
They're great for like selling mops,

41
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:42,661
late night and nonstick cookware.
And I enjoyed John Oliver.

42
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:45,800
I think John Oliver's great.
And apparently he has a,

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,140
you know,
a lot of people think of all British 

44
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,460
accents as being the same,
but he has like a blue collar British 

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:53,460
accent.
But I don't,

46
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,430
I,
I can't tell the difference too much 

47
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:58,430
except for when I'm watching my fair 
lady or something.

48
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,940
Well,
I could tell people from Manchester and 

49
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:02,940
stuff like that because they,
they,

50
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,830
you know,
they have like the sort of way of 

51
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,240
talking so fast that all the words kind 
of pile into each other.

52
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,190
But uh,
yeah,

53
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:10,820
Oliver's,
his uh,

54
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,210
his recent one.
Eddie Bravo got really mad at it.

55
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,780
The recent one about,
uh,

56
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,780
Alex Jones is fucking hilarious.
I don't know if you've seen it.

57
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,200
It's almost impossible to make something
not funny about Alex Jones.

58
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,450
You've got to meet Alex.
have you met him?

59
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,300
I don't know that given how much I've 
made fun of him.

60
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,900
Fine.
He says strip off his shirt and he might

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,020
be,
they'd calm down.

62
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,820
You're a good guy.
We're basically on the same team.

63
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,850
He would come around if you remember the
piers Morgan thing happened two nights 

64
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,370
after Alex was on Piers Morgan said,
Elena.

65
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,420
So appears was like flying high because 
he had that whole debate with Alex and 

66
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,741
Alex did his shtick and it was really 
over the top and he thought I was going 

67
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:52,861
to be like Alex Jones prior to and who's
going to be peers succeeds again and 

68
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:54,660
Alex and I could not be more different 
than our britches.

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,250
No,
you're very rational and very reasonable

70
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,770
and we've been talking about some your 
debates.

71
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,560
There's not a lot of guys like you out 
there,

72
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,010
which is really interesting.
It's like you're a fast thinking,

73
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:11,011
fast talking.
Very smart young guy who's also a 

74
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:14,641
conservative,
like there's not a lot of those out 

75
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:14,641
there.
And this is one of the things that we're

76
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:17,080
encountering today is there,
especially in college campuses,

77
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,110
there's this very strange separation 
between the left and the right to the 

78
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:27,040
point where the right is like almost 
nonexistent or at least doesn't have any

79
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,030
representation and they're actively 
shunning that representation.

80
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,270
Like they're pushing people out.
I know what's going on with you in 

81
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:36,270
Berkeley.
Has that been written seven resolved?

82
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:36,270
Yeah,
I think that uh,

83
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:36,960
so,
so Berkeley,

84
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:39,390
after the publicity they said they're 
going to explain to people if they don't

85
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:40,420
know the whole story.
Yes.

86
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,880
So UC Berkeley,
if you recall,

87
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:46,881
last year,
I actually spoke there before any of 

88
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:48,891
this happened.
I spoke to UC Berkeley and April 2016 

89
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:51,350
and then Milo was supposed to speak 
there and he actually went there and 

90
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,651
there was a riot where antifa 
infiltrated the student community and 

91
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,220
there are all these pictures of them 
bombing things and blowing up cars and 

92
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,460
then understanding them in a fire at 
least in and throwing things at windows.

93
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,640
And so Berkeley shut down that event for
safety reasons.

94
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:06,080
Then Ann Coulter wanted to speak there 
and they basically used what they called

95
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:11,081
time,
place and manner restrictions to stop 

96
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:11,081
her.
They kept saying,

97
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:11,081
well we have safety problems,
we can't figure out how to do the event.

98
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,980
And in the end they just canceled it 
because they didn't have security.

99
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,310
And then young Americans foundation 
which sponsors me to go to a lot of 

100
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:19,310
these campuses,
they.

101
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,480
So we want Shapiro to come and again I 
spoke to like a year and a half ago and 

102
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,720
they give them two and a half months 
advance and Berkeley said,

103
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,070
well we have no venues available and so 
this seemed to be another cover for.

104
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:34,071
We're not going to allow a conservative 
on campus because their security 

105
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:34,650
problems.
So we made that public and then Berkeley

106
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:34,900
said,
no,

107
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:35,040
no,
no,

108
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:35,500
no,
we'll,

109
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:35,960
we'll,
we'll make,

110
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,660
we'll make sure that you get in.
They give us an alternative venue and do

111
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,160
they even said they covered the security
things?

112
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,300
They didn't like the bad publicity.
Oh,

113
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:43,090
well that's nice.
Yeah.

114
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,740
So that should be good.

115
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,000
Well you know what happened with Jordan 
Peterson yesterday?

116
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:46,660
Yes.
Yeah,

117
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:51,661
just yesterday,
Jordan Peterson was banned from youtube 

118
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:54,400
and Youtube has a new policy that uh,
it's very,

119
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,490
it's very weirdly worded,
but apparently they're allowed to block 

120
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:04,531
and restrict any kind of videos that are
about religion or that could be deemed 

121
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:06,610
offensive,
which is almost everything.

122
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,270
Yeah,
that's right.

123
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,120
And anything that's remotely,
if I mean,

124
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,010
anything that's interesting is,
is going to be offensive to somebody.

125
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,050
So won't be monetize,
it also won't be in the videos of 

126
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,050
interest or

127
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,720
I know they did this to a prager 
university as well.

128
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:21,180
They had blocked like 10 of their videos
a couple of months ago.

129
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,580
So it's,
it's.

130
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,800
Yeah,
I mean this is nasty stuff and listen,

131
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,000
youtube as a private company,
they have the right to do what they want

132
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:30,420
but don't proclaim that are a free 
speech promoting institution.

133
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:31,500
If you're going to block people like 
Jordan,

134
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,430
well the the problem is they're not 
blocking things that are offensive to 

135
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,860
other people there.
They're not blocking certain things that

136
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:42,170
are representing Islam in a positive 
light.

137
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,660
There's,
there's a lot of weirdness with this 

138
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,381
left wing choice of what to sensor and 
what not to censor and it's not just 

139
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:56,291
dangerous.
It's also bad for the whole idea of 

140
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,920
being a progressive or being liberal 
cause it makes you look.

141
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:04,510
It makes them look really petty and 
really weird and really resistant and 

142
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,620
hesitant to actually have real debate.

143
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,290
Yeah,
for sure.

144
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,300
And this is one of the reasons why I'm 
very meticulous in my terminology about 

145
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,750
people who are on the other side of the 
aisle,

146
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:14,970
actually separate people who are liberal
from people who are leftists.

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,710
So when there are people who try to band
speech,

148
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,950
I call them leftist,
and if they are not interested in 

149
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:21,950
banding speech,
then their liberal,

150
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,650
meaning they want bigger government,
they disagree with me on politics,

151
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:27,651
but they're still willing to have a 
conversation and they want an open 

152
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,411
forum.
People who are on the hard left think 

153
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:30,570
that it's actually an insult to their 
identity to disagree with them.

154
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,220
And this is what I experienced sometimes
on,

155
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,150
on campuses,
you know,

156
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:35,430
at cal state la where there's a near 
riot when I speak,

157
00:06:35,431 --> 00:06:40,431
or University of Wisconsin where people 
stormed the stage and stand in front of 

158
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:40,440
it and won't leave or state where we 
have,

159
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,710
again,
another near violence incident over at 

160
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:45,710
Penn state or depaul where they actually
banned me outright.

161
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,020
So sometimes you get this routine,
uh,

162
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,150
from people who think that they conflate
their viewpoint with their identity.

163
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:52,890
And then if you have a different 
viewpoint,

164
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:54,990
you're denying them their humanity and 
it's like,

165
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:56,010
no,
I'm not the nine years.

166
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,820
I just think what you're saying is dumb.
Like

167
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,720
good point.
That's a very good point is that they 

168
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,120
have their identity completely connected
with their ideology.

169
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,410
And when you oppose these people,
when you have these debates or these 

170
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,621
people,
what's really fascinating is the level 

171
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:14,500
of a stereo that gets reached while 
you're staying calm.

172
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,660
Yeah.
That's what I've noticed is that there's

173
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:18,190
a ton of.
You know,

174
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:20,320
I,
I tend to keep relatively calm just as a

175
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:22,950
human being and very often when I'm 
debating someone,

176
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,990
you see them getting more and more and 
more emotional and people on the right 

177
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,511
love this because of course it's the 
triggering of the snowflakes are the 

178
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:33,211
easiest thing in the world to do is 
trigger some idiot college kid who 

179
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:33,211
doesn't know his ass from a hole in the 
ground and what.

180
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:38,090
What's.
What's hard to do is actually discuss 

181
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,090
issues with somebody who is intelligent 
enough to make the,

182
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,780
to make the point.
But it's the level of hysteria on the 

183
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:42,940
campuses has really increased.
I mean,

184
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,330
I know you have to travel with two 
members of security to every campus just

185
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:48,040
because you don't know which campus is 
going to go off.

186
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,570
I never had to travel security before.

187
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,030
It's the weirdest thing in the world.
How long ago did this start happening?

188
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,300
Well,
in February of Twenty 16 is when I 

189
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,340
started traveling with security,
so I spoke at University of Missouri.

190
00:07:57,341 --> 00:08:02,341
They remember they had the big blow up a
university of Missouri with black lives 

191
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:05,641
matter taking over campus offices and 
suggesting that there was some sort of 

192
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:06,580
big racism problem at Missou,
which is just ridiculous.

193
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,000
And so they flew me and I did a speech 
there and then the next time I spoke was

194
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,300
cal state La and they brought in a 
couple of security guys and I was like,

195
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,330
what do I need security for?
But I'm just speaking on a campus who 

196
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,611
cares?
We get to the campus and they had 

197
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:20,611
already tried to cancel my speech 
because of security and I said,

198
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:21,580
I'm coming anyway.
So tough.

199
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,210
I had to be escorted in by 20 armed 
police officers.

200
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,020
I had to be escorted off campus by 
motorcycle cops flashing their lights.

201
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:34,170
There were 300 students who had blocked.
All of the entrances were physically 

202
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:34,210
assaulting people,
trying to get into the theater.

203
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,000
The police had to sneak the students in 
two by two into the theater.

204
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,340
They told them that until I left the 
campus,

205
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,490
they couldn't actually let the kids out 
of the theater because they were afraid 

206
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:44,490
that if they let the kids out of the 
theater,

207
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:44,710
there'd be attacked as they got,
as they were released.

208
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,780
It was.
That one was pretty well.

209
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:47,710
It's after that.
It was okay.

210
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:49,210
Well,
I guess the security is necessary.

211
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,590
Wow.
What is shifting?

212
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,460
Like what?
What is,

213
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,810
what is ramping things up?

214
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,070
I think the identity is ramping things

215
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,070
up,
so I think there's a new mentality out 

216
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,321
there.
It's this intersectionality politics on 

217
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:06,111
the left that says that there are a 
bunch of victim groups basically are 

218
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:06,480
there blacks and Hispanics and gays and 
Jews and Asians.

219
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:11,481
They're all victim groups and we get 
those all those people together to 

220
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:13,080
attack the system because the system is 
keeping them down and if you.

221
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,120
And,
and there's a hierarchy among these 

222
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,120
victim groups,
and if you are a straight white male,

223
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,570
you're at the very,
very bottom of the hierarchy in terms of

224
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:22,680
viewpoints that should be acknowledged 
because you're the creators of this vast

225
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,720
white supremacist system that keeps down
everybody else.

226
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:26,850
So if you're a black woman,
you're near the top right?

227
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,320
If you're LGBT,
you're at the top.

228
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,650
If you're a white guy and you challenged
the viewpoint of a black woman,

229
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,390
your viewpoint is an attack on her 
identity and therefore she has the right

230
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:37,230
to shut you down.

231
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,560
And so the idea is that your words are 
violence to her identity and therefore 

232
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:47,751
she has the right to react.
This is the term you hear on campus a 

233
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:49,500
lot is microaggressions as idea that my 
opinion microaggressive you know,

234
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,190
even that terminology I think is really 
stupid because normally in regular life 

235
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,310
we would say that's insulting.
And he said something,

236
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,610
I don't like the terminology.
Microaggression suggests aggression.

237
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:01,890
Like I'm actually doing something 
aggressive to you.

238
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,250
And the rational response to someone 
aggressing you is to use physical force 

239
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:07,250
in response.
And so you start,

240
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,150
you start to see a more violent 
response.

241
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,830
I think that's.
It's been growing in our politics.

242
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:12,830
I think there's a reactionary side on 
the right that's,

243
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,870
that's growing.
And if there's an identity politics on 

244
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:17,870
the left that says now black identity 
politics,

245
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,650
gay identity politics,
female identity politics,

246
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:24,651
I think you're starting to see in some 
areas of white identity politics that's 

247
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:24,651
almost formed in response.

248
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:24,651
Like,
okay,

249
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:26,610
well if everybody else gets to have 
their identity politics,

250
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:28,740
why can't we defend ourselves on those 
same grounds?

251
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,670
I hate that shit.
It's terrible.

252
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,730
I hate that shit too.
And I would like to find the person who 

253
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,210
invented the term microaggression,
that fucker,

254
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:38,630
whoever it was,
they.

255
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,380
They created quite a mess.
Now,

256
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:43,630
I'm sure you saw what happened at 
Evergreen with Bret Weinstein.

257
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,650
We're,
we're literally left is eating itself 

258
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:48,650
and that's where it gets crazy.
He's like,

259
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,901
you're not progressive enough unless 
you're literally submitting to leaving 

260
00:10:51,971 --> 00:10:56,971
your class because you're white.
Like you can't be there because you're 

261
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:58,180
white.
They want a day of absence,

262
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,820
meaning the professors,
the white people.

263
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:06,030
And then when you don't do it,
you're somehow in other racist and a 

264
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,030
Nazi.
I mean,

265
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,261
the whole thing is,
the whole thing was very bizarre to 

266
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:10,261
watch,
but,

267
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:15,150
but not not surprising because you see 
it so much so often all over the country

268
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:20,461
right now and it's almost like some new 
flower of ridiculous thinking and 

269
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:23,230
behavior has blossomed and it's in bloom
everywhere.

270
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,990
And when people can point to it existing
in other places,

271
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:28,630
like in Missouri where that woman,
what was her name?

272
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,140
Who was that woman who got the click?
Yeah,

273
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,810
whatever her name was that when you see 
it in video,

274
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,560
when you see her on video saying,
can we get some muscle over here?

275
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,970
Like this is fucking insane.
Like you're,

276
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,860
you're telling a photographer and by the
way,

277
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:49,861
a minority and Asian Asian man taking 
photos of a public place that you've 

278
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,530
created some safe space.
But it's,

279
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,500
it's,
it's this weird thing where it's half of

280
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:59,860
it is identity politics,
but it's also wrapped up in this need to

281
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:02,440
control people and control people's 
behavior.

282
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,950
Control their vernacular,
control the way they communicate.

283
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:10,951
And how you know how much you give in to
group think it's weird.

284
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:17,090
It's scary.
And a Jonathan Heit who's a social 

285
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,431
psychologist over at Nyu,
he did a really good piece for the 

286
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:20,220
Atlantic in 2015 about this phenomenon,
this kind of safe space,

287
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:25,221
trigger warning phenomenon.
This idea that you must never be forced 

288
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:26,460
into a position where someone has an 
idea that opposes yours.

289
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,410
And what he said is it basically makes 
people crazy.

290
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,680
You know,
it actually makes you crazy that the 

291
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,601
idea in psychology is that if you have a
chain of thoughts leading to a bad 

292
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:39,561
outcome,
if you're depressed or if you're an 

293
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:40,771
oppressive,
then you have a chain of thoughts 

294
00:12:40,771 --> 00:12:42,141
leading to a bad outcome.
The way that psychologists deal with 

295
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:42,141
that is with cognitive behavioral 
therapy.

296
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:42,141
They say,
okay,

297
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:43,560
we're in this chain of thoughts are 
going wrong.

298
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,540
Are you attributing to somebody a motive
they don't have?

299
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,340
Or does your wife really being nasty?

300
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,340
Or is it you just attributing nasty to 
her and that's why you're getting 

301
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,340
depressed or spinning off,
right?

302
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,700
Try to control your own chain of 
thoughts.

303
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,260
What the microaggression trigger warning
culture does is it actually grants down.

304
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,090
The more you are offended,
the more value you are granted,

305
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,790
and therefore you have actually an 
interest in being offended.

306
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,150
We give you awards.
If you're offended by your,

307
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,160
your treasured.
If you're offended because it 

308
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,160
demonstrates that you're woke,
right,

309
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,160
you're.
The more you are offended,

310
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,390
the more we can show that you are woke 
and because you are woke.

311
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,990
Therefore your granted this virtue.
You get to Lord it over everyone else.

312
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:16,830
I mean,
I say in my speeches,

313
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,010
if we could somehow identify like the 
LGBT,

314
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,960
half black,
half Hispanic,

315
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,080
one quarter native American little 
person,

316
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,890
you know,
then we would finally have the,

317
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:31,891
the person who we could go to dance for 
all of our questions because their 

318
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:31,891
identity would be unquestionable.
It'd be Yoda,

319
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,270
right?
If we could find yoga,

320
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,510
we could just get rid of democracy and 
discussion altogether.

321
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,260
He can just rule from on high.
He,

322
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:39,240
she and I don't want to put a gender on 
Yoda,

323
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,080
right?
I don't think Yodas gender does Yoda.

324
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,290
It's got to be a guy or deep voice.
Maybe we're being rude by incidents.

325
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,220
No,
but yeah,

326
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:52,180
you're absolutely right because no one 
is a no one's left enough.

327
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:52,990
Yeah,
it's,

328
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,250
it's.
I don't know where the limit is and it's

329
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,340
there so far left that they've actually 
made common cause with the people they 

330
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,340
hate.
Right.

331
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,060
So when they talk about safe spaces and 
saw it,

332
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:07,070
you had misery and all these black 
students protesting and they actually 

333
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,871
said,
we don't want white people who think 

334
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:09,871
like us and who want to help us in our 
safe spaces.

335
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:11,920
We feel insulted by that.
I just thought to myself,

336
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:13,390
well,
the KKK agrees,

337
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,120
like if you want to do safe spaces for 
separate races,

338
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,260
I can find some Jim Crow racist are 
totally up for that from like 1962.

339
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:25,450
Well,
there's the really bizarre statement 

340
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,701
that I've heard over and over again that
black people cannot be racist against 

341
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:28,250
white people because they don't have any
power over white people.

342
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,920
Yes.
Wow.

343
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,110
Which is just insane.
I mean,

344
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:37,050
it's an an inane statement.
This idea that you have to.

345
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,140
You have to have power in the 
superstructure in order for you to even 

346
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,171
to be erased.
I could understand the argument if they 

347
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:45,171
said,
look,

348
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:45,390
you being racist is not connected to 
racist action.

349
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,880
If you don't have the capacity for 
action that affects people,

350
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,920
then your personal racism is not as 
important as the of people in power.

351
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,250
Then at least is an argument where the 
idea that you can't be racist at all if 

352
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,781
you're,
if you're black because black people 

353
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:01,781
don't have enough pat.
First of all,

354
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,740
the idea that black people have no power
in the United States is utterly crazy.

355
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,820
I mean,
it's utterly crazy.

356
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,850
Well,
especially when it was going on while 

357
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:09,850
Mama was president,
the attorney general was the president.

358
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,700
I always said this about Baltimore.

359
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,350
We kept hearing in Baltimore,
right?

360
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,420
Would they?
The riots they'd bought,

361
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,840
they'd riots and they were saying,
well,

362
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:16,250
Baltimore PD,
you know,

363
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,840
they're,
they're cracking down on black people.

364
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:23,020
I'll get the chief of police was black.
The majority of the city council was 

365
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,020
black and Democrat.
The entire,

366
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,720
the,
the deputy district attorney who was 

367
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,741
prosecuting the case was black.
The majority of the police department 

368
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:32,381
was minority.
The attorney general of the United 

369
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:32,381
States was black and the president of 
the United States was black,

370
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:34,040
but apparently the majority of the city 
of Baltimore is black,

371
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,830
but apparently it's the white guys felt 
like I just at some point,

372
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:41,660
you're gonna have to make your ideas 
actually work in concert with reality.

373
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,190
I can't.
I can't do this with you.

374
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,310
Do you ever step back and look at this 
trend and look at what's going on in 

375
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:54,130
popular culture and looking what's going
on with identity politics in this war 

376
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,000
between the left and the right and 
wonder where it's going.

377
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,240
I mean,
if it feels like the people on the left 

378
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,730
are completely emboldened by the fact 
that you have this guy in office who has

379
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:09,731
said things like grabbing by the pussy 
and he lives all the time and makes fun 

380
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:14,441
of people's plastic surgery and you 
think that having this guy in in this 

381
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:20,231
position,
I guess in some way emboldens them and 

382
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:21,650
makes them even more convinced the fact 
they're right.

383
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,910
You know,
fight,

384
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,660
but put up the resistance and the 
hashtag resistance.

385
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,670
Hashtag resist.
It's all over the place.

386
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,110
Where does this go?

387
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,080
I think.
Well,

388
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:31,740
no place.
Good.

389
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:36,741
I think what's happening,
and it's one of the things that I 

390
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:39,051
personally am not a fan of,
and this goes all the way back to the 

391
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:41,361
piers Morgan debate you mentioned.
I mean I started off that debate with 

392
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:43,851
Piers Morgan saying to him,
you don't get to attribute intent to me 

393
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:43,851
that I don't have.
Right?

394
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:48,800
You're standing on the grades,
the kids at Sandy Hook in order to 

395
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,601
promote your political agenda implying I
don't care enough about dead kids 

396
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:53,840
because I don't agree with you.
That is the sweet spot where a lot of 

397
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,960
people like to live,
which is if we disagree on politics,

398
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:56,370
is because you're an asshole,
right?

399
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,140
It's not.
It's not because we disagree on the best

400
00:16:58,141 --> 00:17:03,141
methods you get to the goal or we have 
different goals is because you're a bad 

401
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:06,360
person and I think that what you're 
seeing is with trump there an attempt to

402
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:10,320
cast all of his voters as people who 
love all of the things that are bad that

403
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:15,321
he does and says is that that they voted
for him because they thought Hillary 

404
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:15,390
Clinton was the worst presidential 
candidate in the history of America,

405
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:16,020
which is true.

406
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,420
Right?
So they voted for him because they liked

407
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:19,710
the.
Grab them by the p word stuff,

408
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,010
right?
They voted for him because they liked 

409
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,010
it.
He's vulgar and he lies a lot.

410
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,200
They voted for him because they are bad 
people right there.

411
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:30,201
This is why people misread.
I think Hillary Clinton's deplorable 

412
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:30,201
speech it.
The implication was,

413
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,240
okay,
everybody who voted for trump is a bad 

414
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,240
human being.
They tried this with Rami too.

415
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,111
I mean they tried to castigate Romney,
who's whatever you can say about Mitt 

416
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:39,111
Romney.
Mitt Romney was maybe the most honorable

417
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:43,611
person ever to run for the presidency.
They tried to cast him as Joe Biden's 

418
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:44,620
had a guy who wants to put y'all back in
chains or he said that he.

419
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,610
He straps dogs at the top of his car is 
an evil,

420
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:49,660
nasty guy.
Oh yeah.

421
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Yeah.
This was a big issue in the campaign is 

422
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:54,740
dogs.

423
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:54,740
So there was,
there was a,

424
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,710
there was a story,
I think it's in the Boston Globe about 

425
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,051
how like back in 1982,
he went on a family vacation and when 

426
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:03,501
they're traveling he put the dog in a 
cage and put the dog on the top of his 

427
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:03,501
car.
And this was.

428
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:04,380
And this was like a big campaign issue,
right?

429
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,560
Do you remember binders full of women 
and you remember you remember 47 percent

430
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,290
number.
Exactly right.

431
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:15,291
He's mean he hates the poor.
He hates what the binders full of women 

432
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:15,390
thing was particularly stupid because 
the entire point he was making is that I

433
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:17,270
was trying to recruit women to my 
administration,

434
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:19,860
so they'd bring binders full of female 
resumes to me,

435
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,130
second staff moral women,
and they turned it into binders full of 

436
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,651
women.
He's like Hugh hefner and Mitt Romney 

437
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:27,651
like,
really?

438
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:30,480
So this attempt to castigate the other 
side is really bad and I think that you 

439
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,520
see some of that on the right,
but I think it's more reactionary.

440
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:37,521
I think that that the unearned moral 
superiority that the left likes to kind 

441
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:40,641
of wallow in.
I think that that's more on the left 

442
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:42,871
than on the right.
Although I think that there is an 

443
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:42,871
attempt by some on the right now in 
response to it to do some of that.

444
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:47,340
Well,
it becomes these sticking points that 

445
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,340
you use to win,
you know,

446
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,651
and it.
And it becomes something that people 

447
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:50,651
repeat over and over again,
you know,

448
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:51,370
like the deplorable thing.
Or is this sexist,

449
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:52,180
bigot,
homophobe.

450
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,930
It's just what I was walking down New 
York City down the street.

451
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:01,010
Uh,
right after trump won when they were 

452
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,180
protesting and there was this guy right 
next to me fucking screaming.

453
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,760
He wasn't even in the actual parade 
itself.

454
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:07,090
He was like on the sidewalk,
but he was screaming,

455
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,630
Donald Trump KKK,
racist,

456
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:12,320
sexist,
anti gay.

457
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,900
Just boiled it down to this thing.
But the best part about it was he saw a 

458
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,650
black guy coming towards him and he just
started screaming black lives matter,

459
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,240
black lives matter,
and I just,

460
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,290
I just,
I saw him.

461
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:31,291
I saw his soul like in that,
in that one move shift to screaming 

462
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,920
black lives banner when he saw a black 
guy.

463
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,550
No,
there's the intersectionality for you,

464
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:40,551
right?
You have to know how to appeal to every 

465
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:40,551
racial group on the basis of a 
stereotype.

466
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:41,340
It could have been Thomas Sowell,
they wouldn't have known.

467
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Yeah.
It's almost like the laziness in having 

468
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,031
the ability to communicate is one thing.
But having the ability to express a 

469
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:55,051
complete thought that covers something 
as nuanced and as complex as American 

470
00:19:55,421 --> 00:19:58,390
politics in 2017,
that's too hard.

471
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,170
So let's just yell out Donald Trump KKK 
and this,

472
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:07,350
this ability to like boil down what's 
the difference between the left and the 

473
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,170
right to like a little statement is or 
you know,

474
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,500
a bucket of deplorable basket of 
deplorables,

475
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,520
whatever it is.
You know,

476
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,280
binders of women.
It's so tempting because it's like,

477
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,550
it's so powerful that it works.
You could put it on the back of a bumper

478
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,220
sticker.

479
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,750
I think we've also been shaped a little 
bit by a lot.

480
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:22,940
We all.
We all live in Hollywood.

481
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:27,941
I mean you live in Hollywood.
I live in Hollywood that that means 

482
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:27,941
that,
and I think all of America lives in that

483
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:29,540
milieu because everyone watches tv.
Everybody watches movies,

484
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,840
so when we do politics,
we tend to see it through the prism of 

485
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,140
house of cards or or any of the other 
political movies you've ever seen.

486
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,090
And that means there's a bad guy,
right?

487
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:39,020
Everybody.
There's a bad guy.

488
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,230
The villain and the villain has to.
It can't just be the villain is somebody

489
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:44,240
who's incompetent.
Like usually in politics,

490
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:49,270
if somebody is bad,
sometimes they have a level point of 

491
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,270
view.
That's pretty rare.

492
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,860
Usually it's somebody who's misguided 
and it had some bad ideas.

493
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,660
Usually they're just stupid or 
incompetent.

494
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,120
Like this is what I keep saying to 
people who oppose trump.

495
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,420
Like why are you attributing to him 
malice when stupidity would do like you 

496
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,100
keep saying that everything trump is 
doing is out of some sort of malicious 

497
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,100
genius.
Are we watching the same film?

498
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,320
Like if you have a problem with trump,
it seems to have a solution for the 

499
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,320
left.
By the way,

500
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,660
if they,
if they really hate trump this much,

501
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,640
it wasn't.
I thought Obama was a crappy president.

502
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:17,641
I have a deal.
How about we just minimize the power of 

503
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:17,980
Washington DC and we don't have to give 
a crap whose the president of the United

504
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,880
States.
You think anybody in 18,

505
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:21,850
32 really cared who the president was.
He had no impact on their lives.

506
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,460
But now the presidency has this outsized
impact.

507
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:27,060
We care about Washington all the time.
We treated them in.

508
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,750
The truth is we watch it for fun.
I mean,

509
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:29,980
right now,
the last week,

510
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:31,960
particularly with Scaramucci,
uh,

511
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:34,210
you know,
it's impossible not to watch it for fun,

512
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,670
but it's actually kind of serious 
business.

513
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,190
Like there are other world leaders who 
are actually looking at this.

514
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:41,350
Like,
this impacts my nation for us.

515
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:42,490
We look at it and go,
well,

516
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:45,190
I wonder what's on TV on tonight's 
episode of trump the series.

517
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Well,
when you say reduce the power of the 

518
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,861
president,
I think there's a lot of people that 

519
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:53,271
would think that would be a great idea 
because having one person has the 

520
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:56,300
authority over 300 plus million people.
It is kind of ridiculous this point in 

521
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,060
time,
but how would you go about doing that?

522
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:59,250
Like what would be the best way to 
implement something like,

523
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,920
I mean it really isn't just the 
presidents that you'd have to reduce the

524
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,570
power of Congress as well.
I mean you'd have to.

525
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:07,860
You'd have to go back to a federalist 
based system where localities and states

526
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:13,130
have more power over over local issues 
and the federal government isn't that 

527
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,761
powerful because what's happened 
basically in the constitutional 

528
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:20,031
structure,
the federal government was never 

529
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:20,031
supposed to be anywhere near this big 
right there.

530
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:21,900
There are very certain delegated powers 
in the constitution of the United States

531
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,080
that Congress has and they are very 
small things like building post offices 

532
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,560
and interstate roads and regulating 
interstate commerce,

533
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,090
but the idea that they could regulate,
you know,

534
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:35,091
your toilet flushing is just silly.
I mean the founders would have thought 

535
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:38,571
that was ridiculous.
Yet you have a federal government that 

536
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:38,571
that's,
that's that big,

537
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:39,660
so congress regulates on that,
but if you're in Congress,

538
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,030
the last thing you want is to be 
answerable for that.

539
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,340
So what you do instead is you drop vague
statutes,

540
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,360
right?
You say things like,

541
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,870
we hope that we're passing a law that 
says that we should fix the environment,

542
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:54,170
and then you kick it over to you 
executive branch and the executive 

543
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:54,170
branch,
you know,

544
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,111
run by president trump or president 
Obama has a bunch of executive branch 

545
00:22:57,111 --> 00:23:00,471
agencies like the EPA and the EPA puts 
together all of these regulations that 

546
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:00,471
you've never seen,
never heard of.

547
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:05,391
You never elected these people.
They put together all the regulations 

548
00:23:05,391 --> 00:23:05,391
and then those are the ones that 
actually govern your lives.

549
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,770
So if you're in Congress and things go 
bad,

550
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:08,160
you say,
well,

551
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:13,190
that's not what I meant to do.
I told them to do good stuff and the 

552
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,190
bureaucrats were not elected.
Don't have to care.

553
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,640
So basically we have everyone kicking 
the can to the other person for purposes

554
00:23:17,641 --> 00:23:22,641
of responsibility.
The only way this is going to happen is 

555
00:23:22,641 --> 00:23:25,011
if the American people just decide 
they're sick of the federal government 

556
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:27,800
running all this stuff and they start 
actively working to elect people who 

557
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,400
want to minimize their own power,
which is difficult.

558
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:34,401
I mean,
most people in power don't want to 

559
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:34,401
minimize their own power.

560
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:34,401
Yeah.
That seems almost impossible.

561
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:38,900
It seems like the one who's worked so 
hard to get to the top of the game is 

562
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:39,480
going.

563
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,780
Yeah.
The other way to do it is to elect 

564
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:44,780
people on the state level who are pretty
zealous about their own authority.

565
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,300
Right.
You've seen from like Greg Abbott in 

566
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Texas

567
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,300
that every so often he'll say to the 
federal government,

568
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,490
listen,
you're telling me to do something.

569
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,870
Go screw yourselves.
Like,

570
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,570
what are you gonna do about it?
Well,

571
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,970
Texas is a weird one though.
They're almost ready to leave,

572
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,090
like at any point in time,
it's related to put a fence up and go,

573
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:01,790
fuck you.
I mean,

574
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,440
weren't there for the longest time?
They were,

575
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,440
uh,
they were not really a state right now.

576
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,040
They're still called the Republic of 
Texas.

577
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,420
Right.
You said that so yeah,

578
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:10,310
I mean the people in Texas,
I mean it didn't.

579
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,630
Wonderful state.
I love that.

580
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:15,860
When you drive through Texas,
every single store is called lone star,

581
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:21,790
lone star brewery or Texas.
This everything is named after the 

582
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,671
state.
Like nothing is really named after the 

583
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:24,671
country.
It's all named after the state.

584
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,731
Like a lot of state pride in Texas.
There's a lot of state pride maybe more 

585
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:27,731
than any place else I've ever been.
Yeah,

586
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:32,261
well not a lot of state pride in 
California because everybody's a 

587
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:32,450
transplant and it also like some,
you know,

588
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,480
people who got here and it represents 
something that they always wanted some 

589
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,681
sort of a liberal paradise where you 
could get famous for doing nothing.

590
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,010
There's some city pride,
like there's Hollywood pride,

591
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,780
San Jose Pride,
but like California pride.

592
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,030
I mean the people who run the state are 
idiots.

593
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:56,060
Will California so confused?
I mean we have a grizzly bear on our 

594
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,060
flag,
but we don't have Chrisley bears.

595
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,420
We have,
we have a team called the Los Angeles 

596
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:01,420
Lakers,
a lake in the state.

597
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,750
Our lakes are all manmade.
We have to keep pumping water in because

598
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:08,751
they fucking dry up a river is just a 
giant concrete ravine over is hilarious.

599
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:13,000
When I've shown people the La River,
my fest,

600
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,720
La River,
they're like,

601
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,360
shut up.
Yeah.

602
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:18,300
The Romantic river.
No,

603
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:18,670
no,
no.

604
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,130
The La River.
It is la.

605
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:27,131
It's a fucking concrete shitty slide for
water and that the city is so dirty.

606
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,180
I mean it's like I've grown up my entire
life here.

607
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:37,181
I mean I was born in Burbank,
grew up in north Hollywood like this is 

608
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:37,181
that I've lived here my entire life.

609
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:41,440
The first time I realized I liked it is 
when I moved to Boston for law school 

610
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:41,440
because at least the weather here is 
good,

611
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,770
but yeah,
I mean it's gotten so shabby lately.

612
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,260
It's such a shabby city.
The weather's amazing,

613
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,330
but.
Have you ever been to Mexico City?

614
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,030
No.
I've been a couple times for UFC events.

615
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:55,031
I'm not going back because I would get 
headaches from the pollution in Mexico 

616
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:00,070
City to me is like Ellie in the future,
but with zero respect for the traffic 

617
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,520
lights.
When I mean zero,

618
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:03,770
I've never seen anything like it.
It's crazy.

619
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,860
They're very nice people like 
everybody's worried about getting 

620
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,811
kidnapped over there.
I find Mexican people to be some of the 

621
00:26:10,811 --> 00:26:11,840
nicest people and real friendly and easy
to get along with,

622
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:14,630
but they don't give a fuck about traffic
lights.

623
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,780
When we were stuck in traffic was bumper
to bumper and it's a green light going 

624
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,740
this way.
Cars just go in front of you and they 

625
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,991
just sort of make their way through and 
people hit the brakes and they make 

626
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:30,341
their way through the intersection.
It's a straight up red light and they 

627
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:31,650
just go and it's not just one.
One guy goes and another guy goes behind

628
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:34,940
them and then he got like 20 cars and 
and it's just gridlock.

629
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,140
It's actually indicative of why the 
United States works,

630
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,910
that people actually follow traffic 
lights,

631
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,230
like it's true in Italy.
Also true in Israel,

632
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,260
like when I visited Israel with my wife 
when we got married,

633
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,380
like no one pays attention to the 
traffic rules.

634
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,970
Everyone's honking their horns at each 
other.

635
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:51,610
I'm American.
So like,

636
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,040
why are these people so rude all the 
time?

637
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,800
Mom honked the horn.
She,

638
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,700
but it is why in America,
because we have a baseline,

639
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,140
this is what I think is breaking down 
actually,

640
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:03,450
so not to get too deep on a point about 
Mexican city traffic,

641
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:05,150
but I think that,
you know,

642
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,430
the country was based on this idea.
There's a social fabric.

643
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:13,431
We all have respect for each other 
enough that we're going to follow the 

644
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:13,800
basic rules of the game and that's true 
as far as traffic lights,

645
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,880
it's true as far as financial dealings 
with one another and when you lose that,

646
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:20,490
when you lose the basic respect for the 
guy who lives next to you,

647
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:22,080
you know,
you need to get through the red light in

648
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:22,500
a screw him.

649
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,500
It doesn't matter if it's red,
then it's kind of indicative of a 

650
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,831
culture in collapse.
Generally when small rules start to go 

651
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:31,220
broken,
like in Italy,

652
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,500
in Italy,
is that 50 percent of their economies 

653
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:36,500
black market because they have high tax 
rates and no one pays them.

654
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,450
You're starting to set in California to 
California is the highest taxes in the 

655
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,301
country by far.
We also have the number one rate of 

656
00:27:44,301 --> 00:27:47,061
deductions,
so we pass all these high Texas so we 

657
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:49,161
can congratulate ourselves for social 
justice and then we avoid all the taxes 

658
00:27:49,161 --> 00:27:51,360
as much as we possibly can for the 
accountants.

659
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,050
Yeah,
exactly.

660
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,080
Hey,
those people are making on a fricking 

661
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,080
fortune.

662
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,420
Well,
I just also feel like when you get a 

663
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,280
giant number of people smashed into a 
small area and La,

664
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:05,300
it's not even a small area includes 
Greater Orange County and it goes into 

665
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,260
the Conejo valley and it's just like 
there's so many of us,

666
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:12,290
there's so many.
It's almost like you get that sort of 

667
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,711
diffusion of responsibility thing where 
there's just too many people to care 

668
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:19,110
about and you lose this feeling of value
that you have for fellow people.

669
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,260
I lived in boulder for a little while 
and when I lived there,

670
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:24,990
the People's Republic of Boulder.
You want to talk about lefties?

671
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,920
Oh yeah.
Holy Shit.

672
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:28,950
If you have a.
If you had a right wing anything on your

673
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:31,020
lawn,
like a sign for someone running for,

674
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:33,870
they would take it down.
They literally take things down,

675
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:39,350
but when I was there I was amazed at how
many people are polite when they drive 

676
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,000
in.
They wave and like there's only 100,000

677
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:42,150
people.

678
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,210
Exactly.
So that,

679
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:44,100
that.
That's how I was gonna send me.

680
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:45,100
I'm looking it up while we're sitting 
here.

681
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:46,480
It's like 110,000
people in.

682
00:28:46,481 --> 00:28:49,480
The other population of La County is 10 
million people.

683
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,090
It's

684
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,970
plus Mexicans.
You gotTa Count Mexicans and then you 

685
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,651
got account.
Everybody's connected to all the other 

686
00:28:58,651 --> 00:28:58,651
counties around it.
It's not like there's some

687
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:00,780
border and we just drive around.
That's exactly right.

688
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,690
So it is in the first time I visited 
Oklahoma,

689
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:06,240
I had this and I was in Oklahoma for 
doing radio show.

690
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,360
When you look at the 23 point seven,
$7 million.

691
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,080
Yeah.
Sorry,

692
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,830
go ahead.
Yeah,

693
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:16,190
I mean Oklahoma and I'm walking down the
street and the first thing that and and 

694
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,400
just some lady and I catch eyes now in 
La,

695
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:18,810
you're from La,
you look away,

696
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:20,840
right?
You only got stabbed in others.

697
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,920
If you catch eyes with somebody you 
meet,

698
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:27,921
it's rude.
You don't catch eyes with people at La 

699
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:27,921
and among that street we catch eyes.
Lady Goes,

700
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:29,310
how are you?
I called my father.

701
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:29,710
I was like,
what?

702
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,620
Where am I,
what's going on here?

703
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:36,621
Like this is not regular,
but I do think that there is something 

704
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:36,621
to the idea that if you have too many 
people in too small a space,

705
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:42,050
we're all up in each other's business so
much that it's very hard to say to 

706
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:42,050
people,
okay,

707
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,300
liberty,
stay away from one another,

708
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,740
leave each other alone.
It's like,

709
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:49,741
yeah,
but he lives next door and he's a 

710
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:49,741
jackass.
Hate that guy because he's like,

711
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:53,340
right next to you run Oklahoma.
The guy next to you is three miles down 

712
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,340
the road.

713
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,340
There's that.
And there's also,

714
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:58,071
um,
it's been replicated in rat population 

715
00:29:58,071 --> 00:29:59,160
density studies that you get more mental
illness,

716
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:04,161
you get more weird aggressive behavior 
when they stack rats in these cubicles 

717
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:07,680
and then jam them closer and closer 
together.

718
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:13,010
And that's exactly what's happening with
people to what Manhattan is famous for 

719
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,010
it.
I mean,

720
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,451
I,
I enjoy visiting Manhattan and every 

721
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:17,451
time I'm there I'm always like,
no,

722
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:17,940
I can't.
I can't live here.

723
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,650
Oh yeah.
Too many

724
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,160
when I was there last week and I liked 
the sky.

725
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:23,350
So you can't actually see the sky in 
Manhattan,

726
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:28,351
right?
I mean you just see the brick buildings 

727
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:28,351
and you know,
25 stories high.

728
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:30,220
And I noticed that uh,
we were walking past the store and there

729
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:33,310
was a shirt on sale and the shirts 
entire tax was after you.

730
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:36,100
You effing F and I thought only in New 
York could you sell this,

731
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:36,610
right?
I mean,

732
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:38,650
you try to take this anywhere else and 
people would have been like,

733
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:39,790
wait,
what now?

734
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,620
But New York,
I'm sure that the best seller.

735
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,450
That's why.
Honestly I think it's one of the reasons

736
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:47,080
why trump won is because he's basically 
just a guy from New York.

737
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,300
He's like a taxi driver from New York is
really,

738
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:52,840
really wealthy and you know,
he does what a taxi driver from New York

739
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:54,010
we do if you're really,
really wealthy.

740
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,560
He marries models and builds gold 
toilets and all this kind of stuff.

741
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,920
And people in the rest of the country 
actually take that language seriously.

742
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:02,520
So when he says stuff like you,
we're going to bomb the shit out of him,

743
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,730
you know,
people in New York like,

744
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:04,660
yes.
So what we do,

745
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,130
you know,
and people in Oklahoma like,

746
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,600
wow,
he's serious.

747
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:12,930
Like that's actually gonna happen and 
it's probably not probably that's just 

748
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,920
how people from New York we saw this 
last week,

749
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:19,921
right?
He's talking about the cops and he was 

750
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,301
saying this thing about covering their 
heads before he's talking like a long 

751
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:21,301
island or you know,
he's talking about like,

752
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:21,560
you know,
the,

753
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,630
you know,
they throw him in the back of the paddy 

754
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:26,630
wagon and we do all the and,
and you don't put your head on that it,

755
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,310
you,
they bumped their head,

756
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:28,030
they just killed somebody.

757
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,160
And so the entire meeting went and how 
dare he.

758
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:32,200
He's talking about how cops should rub 
people up.

759
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:37,201
Listen,
is it appropriate for the president of 

760
00:31:37,201 --> 00:31:37,201
the United States to talk like that 
about treatment of suspects know is,

761
00:31:37,201 --> 00:31:38,530
are we supposed to take this super 
seriously?

762
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,620
Like this is like trump is actually 
recommending a policy change with regard

763
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:43,360
to it.
That's what he does.

764
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,680
He works the room,
he's a,

765
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,720
he's a New York real estate guy who 
works the room and more than anything 

766
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,501
else,
if you understand New York and you 

767
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:52,501
understand La,
you understand trump.

768
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:52,501
He's not a giant mystery.
Right?

769
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:54,960
He's just any other reality TV star.
He's a reality.

770
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,590
He's a marketing image guy.
I mean,

771
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:57,280
that's,
that's what he does.

772
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,930
Like he's not even that great at real 
estate.

773
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,580
He puts his name on the side.
He brands himself,

774
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:01,930
he puts his name on the side of 
buildings.

775
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:07,020
They pay him not to be involved in the 
real estate business so they can put 

776
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,020
trump on the side of his hotels.
Great.

777
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,990
I mean,
that's what he does.

778
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,270
That's why I'm kind of shocked that he's
Kinda crappy at the imaging.

779
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:11,350
As far as being a president.
You didn't.

780
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,970
You'd imagine that you'd be better at 
this part of it.

781
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:13,300
At least.

782
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,560
I just think he didn't understand the 
volume of hate that was going to come 

783
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,920
his way and I think he's such an 
EGOMANIAC.

784
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:24,921
He has a hard time dealing with it.
I guess a hard time separating and 

785
00:32:24,921 --> 00:32:28,251
that's one of the things that I've read 
about him that he's getting better at 

786
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:29,400
getting away from the comments and not 
reading comments on twitter,

787
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,910
but he fucking blocks people know about 
that.

788
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,200
Too many sued him.
Yeah.

789
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:39,260
Well there's people at Book Group of 
people suing them and now they're 

790
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,010
actually starting to rule against public
people

791
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,010
who are in the public light.
Being able to block citizens and having 

792
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,540
their own opinion about what this 
person's doing or not doing.

793
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,750
So then you have to say,
well are you allowed to be vulgar 

794
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:52,750
towards the president?
I mean,

795
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,330
how far does that go?
I mean,

796
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,620
what are you allowed to say?

797
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,760
I mean maybe it usually be able to do 
whatever the hell you want about 

798
00:32:59,760 --> 00:32:59,760
anybody,
but if you can't threaten them,

799
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,780
but it's.
It does go more to the level of,

800
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,290
of pettiness.
He's the most powerful man on the planet

801
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,660
is busy blocking people on twitter at 
3:00

802
00:33:07,661 --> 00:33:12,180
in the morning.
Joe Scarborough and what is her name was

803
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,080
facing.

804
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,870
He was saying that she should.
This is the fucking president.

805
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:22,050
He's saying she showed up with bloody 
scars or she was bleeding from her 

806
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:22,650
recent facelift.

807
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,700
Exactly,
and it's first of all,

808
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,140
it turns out that it probably wasn't 
true,

809
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,040
but second it wasn't true.
I mean,

810
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:31,270
fuck goes out when you're bleeding it.
I agree with you.

811
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:32,440
I agree with you,
but it's it.

812
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,920
But this.
I wrote a piece about it in national 

813
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:37,920
review about this.
You know,

814
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,340
you,
you say that the level of hatred 

815
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,781
directed toward trump is warping trump.
I think that it's also a warping some 

816
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:45,841
people on my side of the aisle who are,
who are so interested in the fight that 

817
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:48,100
they're less interested in advancing the
policies that I'd like to see achieved.

818
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:49,780
So I think there's a whole group of 
people where,

819
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:51,370
let's say that trump would just resign 
tomorrow.

820
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:52,210
He'd say,
you know what I've had at,

821
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:57,270
screw it,
I'm out and Mike Pence becomes 

822
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,071
president.
And then Mike Pence proceeds to do all 

823
00:33:59,071 --> 00:33:59,071
the things conservatives want them to 
do.

824
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:02,520
You know,
we get tax reform and we limit 

825
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:02,520
immigration and we do all of these 
things.

826
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,940
But,
but he does not tweet about Mika 

827
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,440
Brzezinski bloody face.
I think there's a whole group of people 

828
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:09,440
on the right will be pissed.
That miss it.

829
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,990
Yeah.
I think that right now because it's fun.

830
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,680
What exactly what they want is somebody 
who pisses off the left more than beats.

831
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:16,990
The left pisses them off.
If you piss off the left.

832
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,960
I think Obama sort of trialed some of 
the right into insanity.

833
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,610
I think there are a lot of people on our
side.

834
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:23,770
Whereas like this jerk,
he just,

835
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,720
he keeps saying things just to Piss us 
off.

836
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,840
And Obama did do some of that and so pro
trump is kind of a twitter troll and so 

837
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,030
he does the same thing.
We're like,

838
00:34:31,031 --> 00:34:32,380
yeah,
that's awesome.

839
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,410
Like two days ago,
trump or yesterday,

840
00:34:35,411 --> 00:34:38,080
there was a report that trump said that 
he thinks the White House's shabby.

841
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,080
Now I can say is somebody on the 
conservative right my entire life.

842
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:46,081
If Obama said that,
we would not let him forget that for 

843
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:46,081
1000 years that the White House is 
shabby.

844
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:50,041
I mean it's,
it's an ass move to say the people's 

845
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:50,050
house is shit first of all to mansion,
right?

846
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:51,220
Like it.
And second of all,

847
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,550
this is the most iconic building on the 
face of the planet is,

848
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,510
Oh,
it's shabby.

849
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,890
How is it chat?
What was he saying?

850
00:34:56,891 --> 00:34:58,170
It was shabby.
He said.

851
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,070
He said they were asking him why he gets
his visits,

852
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:01,990
his golf courses so much.
And he said,

853
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,560
oh,
because?

854
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,680
Because,
because my golf courses are nicer 

855
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,301
because the White House has shabby,
but there are people in the right for 

856
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:09,301
like five and it's funny,
like,

857
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:10,390
you know,
at least he's trolling the left.

858
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:15,391
At least it's ticking them off and say 
guys ticking off the left is not a 

859
00:35:15,391 --> 00:35:18,571
substitute for defeating the left if you
actually care about the feeding the 

860
00:35:18,571 --> 00:35:21,211
left.
Like this is one of the things that 

861
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:21,211
drives me nuts because my,
you know,

862
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:22,740
my life goal has been to promulgate 
particular ideas,

863
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:27,770
not just to piss off the left,
but I think that in the fight there are 

864
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,841
a lot of people who have fallen into the
trap of thinking these two things are 

865
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:30,841
identical.
Right?

866
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:30,841
You piss off the left,
that means you're winning.

867
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:33,460
It's like no pissing off the left.
Maybe part of it,

868
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:38,461
but that's not how you win.
You win by saying things that are true 

869
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:38,461
and if they get pissed,
I get

870
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:38,461
well.
My good friend,

871
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:43,451
Bill Byrd did this piece about Obama 
back when Obama was mocking trump and 

872
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:49,570
saying the one thing that I am that 
you'll never be the president of United 

873
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:49,580
States.
The crowd went nuts.

874
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:54,790
Remember when he did that and Obama was 
saying this on stage and you see trump 

875
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,510
in the audience.
Boiling was big frog.

876
00:35:56,511 --> 00:36:01,511
Double Chin.
Just sitting there eating it all and 

877
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:02,240
that fucking stuck in his craw.

878
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,630
There's,
there's a whole story that came out from

879
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:07,840
buzzfeed about his interaction with a 
guy named Mckay coppins,

880
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,800
a reporter for buzzfeed in which was 
basically like saying to trump like,

881
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:12,850
you're a joke.
You're not going to run.

882
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:18,540
I think trump ran just to just because 
he was sick of people telling him that 

883
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,200
he wasn't going to be president.
I really think that's.

884
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:24,450
That's half of what drives him.
That doesn't mean that he can't do the 

885
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:24,450
things.
I hope he does do good things.

886
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:28,141
He's the president.
I won't every president to do things I 

887
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:30,031
like,
but you know he's going to have to get 

888
00:36:30,031 --> 00:36:31,600
it under control a little bit because he
was willing to keep the MOOC.

889
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,910
I mean the Mooc,
the MOOC was only ousted because.

890
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,540
Oh,
John Kelly and the MOOC is.

891
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,090
Was it.
What did the MOOC say?

892
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:40,750
What was this was about?
Yeah,

893
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,280
that's exactly right.
About him performing.

894
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:47,281
It asks,
why would he think that he could say 

895
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:47,281
that once he's in the office.
I mean,

896
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:47,281
first of all,
I was thinking to see Ben and could even

897
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:47,770
possibly do that.
I mean,

898
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:50,180
Ban is not that flexible.
I know Steve That's not,

899
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,350
that's not something repertoire,
a giant

900
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,730
unit,
but it doesn't matter.

901
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:59,731
Just the idea that he would think he 
must be emboldened by the fact that 

902
00:36:59,731 --> 00:36:59,731
trump has said

903
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:00,430
so many outrageous things.
Well,

904
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,040
I mean there were reports from the New 
York Post that,

905
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,450
that he actually had.
The trump liked it,

906
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,870
that all that happened is that there was
so much blow back that he had to replace

907
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:09,690
Kelly Kelly in there and Kelly's like,
you can't do this,

908
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,740
and trump's like,
okay,

909
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:14,430
fine,
but doesn't it seem more crazy to fire a

910
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:16,920
guy after 10 days and it does to sit him
down and say,

911
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:18,480
hey man,
don't say that again.

912
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,670
You would think,
right,

913
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,840
let's move forward.
That's what they should've done the next

914
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,510
day.
But the problem is he.

915
00:37:22,511 --> 00:37:27,511
He'd been doing it for a week at that 
point and he was out there like saying 

916
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,141
that Ryan priebus was leaking on the 
president and was an enemy of the 

917
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:32,691
president for a week and you're saying 
that he was gonna get him fired and at 

918
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:32,691
the same time,
remember,

919
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:36,741
this is the same week that trump himself
is tweeting out that attorney general 

920
00:37:36,741 --> 00:37:37,260
sessions who is his most loyal supporter
for a year and a half,

921
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,090
that that guy is like a trader.

922
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:44,150
Right?
And that he wishes he would go away 

923
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,150
because he recused himself.
First of all,

924
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,570
trump can fire any of these people at 
any time.

925
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:50,571
Like this is very passive aggressive for
a guy who made his living saying you're 

926
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:53,661
fired on TV.
It's amazing that all the people that 

927
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:56,541
trump has fired.
I've been fired actually through 

928
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:56,541
surrogates.
Yeah.

929
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:56,541
But Mike Flynn resigned.
Uh,

930
00:37:56,541 --> 00:38:00,560
James Comey was fired basically through 
Rod Rosenstein and sessions and then 

931
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,910
Rosenstein had to recuse himself,
which is how you get the special counsel

932
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,400
and Comi found out on television,
TV,

933
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:08,210
right.
Emissary to go to La and,

934
00:38:08,211 --> 00:38:10,260
and give them a letter.
And like everyone,

935
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:12,090
he fires has to be fired in the most.
Roundabout.

936
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:13,490
I,
I think that trump actually this,

937
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,720
I think the dirty little secret is,
I'm not sure trump actually looks firing

938
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:16,830
people and the,
I think,

939
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:18,230
I think he,
I think he kinda like toward,

940
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:23,260
at any handling torturing people,
but I'm not sure that he actually likes 

941
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:23,260
firing them.

942
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,350
Maybe he doesn't like people being mad 
at him face to face.

943
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,960
I think he wants them to love him in 
front of his face.

944
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:29,780
So like when he's not there,
you know,

945
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:33,690
you can make a phone call,
firearm jetson and hang up the phone and

946
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:36,280
you don't have to actually see the guy 
who wants

947
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,320
that guy to like him.
Yeah,

948
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:41,140
I don't recall me thing was really 
bizarre because it was like,

949
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,790
oh,
you can do that.

950
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,890
Like there's this guy is looking into 
improprieties and you can just say,

951
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,030
no,
you can't do that anymore.

952
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,640
You're fired.
You can't look into the things I've done

953
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,020
wrong.
It was eight.

954
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:54,670
Well,
the way he did it was the stupid part.

955
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:56,980
So I was calling for me to be fired 
since last year.

956
00:38:56,981 --> 00:39:01,981
I thought the way he handled the whole 
hillary thing from beginning to end was 

957
00:39:01,981 --> 00:39:04,261
terrible.
I thought that trump should have 

958
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:04,261
replaced him before he became basically 
day one.

959
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:05,200
Here's my new cabinet.
Call me.

960
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,220
You did a great job.
You know,

961
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:08,110
usher him out the door,
bringing somebody new.

962
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,320
He kept him around and then the first 
thing he said to Komi you remember was 

963
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:13,320
when you met him,
he said,

964
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,230
you're more famous than I am.

965
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,100
Well,
when trump says that to you,

966
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,660
that's the writing on the wall right 
there.

967
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,770
First of all,
it's not true,

968
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,920
but second of all,
I think maybe there was also a part of 

969
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:25,920
the problem was a comb is a giant.
Yes.

970
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,340
The trump.
What is he?

971
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:27,950
Six,
eight,

972
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:28,420
six,
eight,

973
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:29,140
six,
96.

974
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,150
Get giant dude.
Towered over.

975
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,200
Crossing is such a comedy and call 
saying he was trying to hide in the 

976
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,511
curtains to avoid trump saying he just 
see Herman Munster over there hiding in 

977
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:43,300
the we're now.
What did you enjoying the show?

978
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:46,540
I mean it's wild.
If I didn't think that nuclear war was a

979
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:51,541
possibility,
but if I see a fucking Korean missile 

980
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:51,541
headed our way,
I'm going to be pissed.

981
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:57,210
When colby was handling the email thing,
what specifically did you not like about

982
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:00,460
it?
What I thought it was was crazy was when

983
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:04,250
he restarted or reopen the case because 
of Houma,

984
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:08,790
having used her cruiser with Anthony 
Wiener's,

985
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,260
all that stuff was like,
that's not enough.

986
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:16,290
Like that seems crazy.
The deleting the emails to me seemed 

987
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:20,971
like I had Mike Baker on from the CIA 
and he said essentially anyone else 

988
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,500
would be in jail for what she did for 
sure.

989
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,400
For sure.
Sure.

990
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:24,760
Right.
Well,

991
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,800
call me if this.
So he screwed it up and then he really 

992
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:29,920
screwed it up.
So when he originally said publicly,

993
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,630
we're not going to prosecute Hillary 
Clinton.

994
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,820
He was doing something he didn't have 
the authority to do.

995
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,040
The FBI does not decide whether to 
prosecute people.

996
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,280
They refer the information to the DOJ 
and then the DOJ decides whether to 

997
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,280
prosecute people.
It was Attorney General,

998
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,300
Loretta Lynch's decision whether to 
prosecute or not.

999
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,440
The statute itself.
Man,

1000
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:46,780
I'm a lawyer.
The statute itself did not say,

1001
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:52,050
do you have intent to commit espionage?
Do you have intent to to make classified

1002
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:55,060
secrets public or expose them to the 
possibility of being made.

1003
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,250
Public intent is not an element of the 
crime.

1004
00:40:57,251 --> 00:40:58,330
Right.
If you do it,

1005
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,060
it's a crime.
So my wife as a doctor,

1006
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,490
and that means that she is under hipaa 
requirements.

1007
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,200
There is no element under hippa that 
says that if she reveals somebody,

1008
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:12,470
you know,
proprietary medical information by 

1009
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:12,470
accident,
well there's no intent,

1010
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:12,880
so she's okay.
That's not part of the statute.

1011
00:41:12,881 --> 00:41:17,881
If she brings some of these medical 
records out to her car and somebody 

1012
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:17,881
steals the medical records,
you know,

1013
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:18,970
if she's working at the va or something,
that's a crime.

1014
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,280
It doesn't matter if she intended to do 
it and just left it in her purse.

1015
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,850
So Komi read the element of intense into
the crime to get hillary off.

1016
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:25,720
And then he said,
okay,

1017
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:27,790
we're not going to prosecute this.
We're going to leave it alone.

1018
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,620
He shouldn't have intervened in the 
first place.

1019
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:34,690
Remember he made an entire case 
basically for why she should be 

1020
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:34,690
prosecuted and then at the end he goes,
but we're,

1021
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:34,850
you know.
But no,

1022
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:39,851
we're not gonna do that.
He also said we're going to keep 

1023
00:41:39,851 --> 00:41:39,851
Congress updated on any future 
development.

1024
00:41:39,851 --> 00:41:41,930
Well you get to October and there's a 
future development.

1025
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:46,931
They found this laptop with all sorts of
information on it with new emails from 

1026
00:41:46,931 --> 00:41:47,540
Hillary Clinton that they haven't seen 
before,

1027
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,750
and now he has an obligation to inform 
Congress because he told them that he 

1028
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,331
would and so he screwed the pooch again 
because he's afraid that if he doesn't 

1029
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:57,560
reveal that information,
Hillary goes on to win and then it comes

1030
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:58,520
out.
There's something criminal.

1031
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,880
Then people are going to blame him for 
Hillary winning and putting a criminal 

1032
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:03,880
and the White House since they say,
oh,

1033
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,160
well,
I'll be fully transparent.

1034
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:06,920
I have to honor my institution.
I'm going to put this out there.

1035
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,280
Of course,
then hillary loses and now he screwed up

1036
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:15,281
twice and then he gets into the White 
House and now he's supposed to be 

1037
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:17,030
investigating the trump Russia stuff at 
the same time,

1038
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:20,240
so now he's investigating basically both
candidates in the 2016 election.

1039
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,750
He handled this the wrong way every step
of the way because he was so focused on 

1040
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:30,550
what will uphold the integrity of the 
FBI and the integrity of the 

1041
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,150
investigation and the integrity of the 
DOJ.

1042
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,260
He was less worried about,
okay,

1043
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:34,340
what do I actually have to do under the 
law?

1044
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:39,341
What's my obligation under the law is 
obligation under the law is to shut us 

1045
00:42:39,341 --> 00:42:39,341
pie hole and the information over to 
Lynch.

1046
00:42:39,341 --> 00:42:40,280
If Lynch wanted to kill the 
investigation,

1047
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:43,130
let her do it.
So in a sense trump was right and saying

1048
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:44,840
that he's a grandstander yeah,
for sure.

1049
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,370
I mean,
I think that part was right,

1050
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,280
but that the problem remember was not 
the firing of Comey.

1051
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,170
It was the two days after he fired 
comey,

1052
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,580
he went to Lester Holt on NBC and he 
said the reason I fired Columbia was not

1053
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,130
all the excuses I gave about the,
the hillary stuff.

1054
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:03,340
It's because of the Russia stuff.
I was angry about how he was handling 

1055
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:03,340
Russia.
I mean,

1056
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,620
that's really stupid.
That's intensely stupid.

1057
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:11,650
It's intensely stupid,
but it's also strange that it didn't go 

1058
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:11,650
anywhere.
Right?

1059
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,700
Like that was it like that?
That's against the law.

1060
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,190
Well,
it's.

1061
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,470
So it's,
you know,

1062
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,270
obstruction.
So obstruction.

1063
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,520
Looking at the statutes obstruction is a
little bit more than that.

1064
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:24,521
So you have to actually obstruct an 
ongoing investigation into criminal 

1065
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:27,971
activity.
There's a counter intelligence 

1066
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:27,971
investigation going on,
but not necessarily a criminal one.

1067
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:31,250
So not to get too specific about it,
but you should get specific about it.

1068
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,320
I mean the obstruction laws,
I mean I've looked into kind of the 

1069
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,351
statutes that they've used to suggest 
obstruction and it's not clear that 

1070
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:39,080
there is any statute that specifically 
governance,

1071
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:41,570
something like this.
Plus it is true that trump does have the

1072
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:46,571
power as the chief executive to fire as 
the commander in chief to fire the FBI 

1073
00:43:46,571 --> 00:43:47,420
director for any reason he chooses.

1074
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,860
Now,
all that said,

1075
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,470
he can be impeached for any reason.
Criminal or noncriminal,

1076
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,940
right?
Impeachment is not a,

1077
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:54,950
you don't actually have to have 
committed a crime to be impeached.

1078
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,610
Right?
Most people don't even understand what a

1079
00:43:56,611 --> 00:44:01,611
peach means.
They think that somehow or another 

1080
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:01,611
impeach means that you kicked out of 
office,

1081
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:01,611
right?
That's not rent.

1082
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:06,171
It is there.
There's the house and they have to vote 

1083
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:06,171
to impeach you.
Uh,

1084
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:06,171
and then there's the senate and they 
have to vote by two thirds.

1085
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:07,670
Majority or a 68.
Yeah,

1086
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:10,160
I think it's two thirds majority to 
actually convict.

1087
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:12,410
You have a set of crimes that they come 
up with,

1088
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:14,330
but these are all political definitions,
right?

1089
00:44:14,331 --> 00:44:15,740
When it says high crimes and 
misdemeanors,

1090
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,930
it doesn't mean they actually have to 
prosecute.

1091
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:22,931
You likely wouldn't have criminal court 
and you'd have to go to jail or any of 

1092
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:22,931
that kind of stuff.

1093
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:22,931
Like they could impeach anybody at 
anytime.

1094
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,560
Clinton didn't even have to commit 
perjury.

1095
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,750
If they didn't want.
If they wanted to impeach him,

1096
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,310
they could.
They could have impeached doubly.

1097
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,350
Every president you can impeach.
It's just a vote.

1098
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:35,710
It's just about.
So all the talk about what's criminal 

1099
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:35,710
and what's not criminal.
The problem for trump,

1100
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:39,951
there are two ways of reading trump's 
behavior in the whole Russia thing 

1101
00:44:39,951 --> 00:44:39,951
right?
Way.

1102
00:44:39,951 --> 00:44:42,591
One is he's got something to hide and 
that's the most obvious way he's got 

1103
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:43,470
something to hide.
That's why he gets rid of Flynn.

1104
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:45,600
We don't know why he got rid of Flynn.
He gets rid of Comey.

1105
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:50,601
We don't really know why he got rid of 
Columbia and then brags to the Russians 

1106
00:44:50,601 --> 00:44:50,601
that it's a pressure off him on the 
Russia stuff.

1107
00:44:50,601 --> 00:44:55,100
So it's a way one is,
he's hiding something and now he's 

1108
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:55,100
firing everybody who gets in the way and
there's,

1109
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,360
you know,
the chain of evidence does not fit that.

1110
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:57,980
I mean,
you know,

1111
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:03,180
he,
he's the people he's angry at in order 

1112
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,061
our attorney general sessions,
the deputy attorney general Rod 

1113
00:45:05,061 --> 00:45:05,061
Rosenstein,
the former head of the FBI,

1114
00:45:05,061 --> 00:45:06,330
James Comey,
the acting head of the FBI,

1115
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:07,360
McCabe,
uh,

1116
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,480
and uh,
and the special prosecutor Robert 

1117
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,830
Mueller.
So those are all people involved with 

1118
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,541
Russia.
Those are the only people he's really 

1119
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:18,861
angry at.
So there's something to be said for the 

1120
00:45:18,861 --> 00:45:18,861
idea that maybe trying to hide 
something.

1121
00:45:18,861 --> 00:45:22,670
On the other hand,
we haven't actually seen any hard 

1122
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,191
evidence of collusion itself.
So we saw an attempt to collude by 

1123
00:45:25,191 --> 00:45:28,341
Donald Trump jr,
but we haven't actually seen any 

1124
00:45:28,341 --> 00:45:31,611
evidence that the Russians were 
providing special information to the 

1125
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:34,431
trump administration,
which was then being weaponized for use 

1126
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:34,431
in the campaign.
We haven't seen any of that stuff.

1127
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,780
So here's the other plausible theory,
and this goes to trump's personality.

1128
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,200
He's so petty and he wants to be loved 
so much that he is angry that people 

1129
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,740
keep saying he run because he won 
because of the Russians.

1130
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:47,940
And so now every time people say that,
he just gets pissed and he fires people.

1131
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,790
So Comi,
I mean this is totally plausible,

1132
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:55,791
right?
Komi comes to him and he said privately 

1133
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:56,910
that you are not under investigation.
And trump says to him,

1134
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,160
well,
why don't you just say that?

1135
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,330
And he says,
well,

1136
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,700
I can't say that because if I say that 
I'm going to have to update congress.

1137
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:05,430
If you do fall under investigation and 
trump doesn't like that,

1138
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,290
he wants the public to know he's free 
and clear.

1139
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,080
So he fires call me and then he goes up 
public and he says,

1140
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:11,310
I didn't like how he was handling the 
Russia thing.

1141
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:13,440
I'm innocent.
Why will these people leave me alone?

1142
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:14,510
Right?
So yeah.

1143
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,100
So there's two ways to read this.
Either he's totally innocent but stupid,

1144
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,030
or he's trying to hide something.
Those are the only two plausible ways of

1145
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:21,870
reading the situation.

1146
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,560
The Donald trump junior thing was really
bizarre because he released all the 

1147
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:27,560
emails,
like I just,

1148
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,380
yeah,
it's like,

1149
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:29,610
look,
I've got nothing to hide.

1150
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,640
Like you aren't supposed to do any of 
these things you're saying in these 

1151
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:34,650
emails.
Yes.

1152
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:36,570
That was not a good moment for,
for trump,

1153
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:41,571
jr.
Do you think you'd go and then you hear 

1154
00:46:41,571 --> 00:46:41,760
that he was coached by his dad again,
you know,

1155
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:42,990
this is.
None of this is gooD stuff.

1156
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:45,630
I think that Donald Trump jr releasing 
the.

1157
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:50,750
First of all,
it is imperative to note eight minutes 

1158
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:50,750
later the New York times released 
basically the email chain.

1159
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:51,860
Right?
So he was meeting,

1160
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,000
he was beating it out of the gate and so
he puts that out there,

1161
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,410
which was a smart move.
I mean,

1162
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,470
it would be smart if it would be smart 
if he had found a way to spin it,

1163
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:59,210
right?

1164
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,650
Like if you'd done it,
if this is the thing in politics,

1165
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:04,140
now the way politics works now is your 
smartest move.

1166
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,440
If there's dirt about you is to be the 
first person out the gate with it and 

1167
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:09,440
you put a spin on it.
Right?

1168
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,610
So like barack obama,
imagine if obama hadn't said anything in

1169
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:16,611
2008 and then we found out a week before
the election that he did coke in high 

1170
00:47:16,611 --> 00:47:17,430
school.
Now a lot of people wouldn't care.

1171
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:19,710
A lot of people would write in 2000 
George W.

1172
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:24,180
Bush was hit with a dui charge from like
1973 and it probably last him a point in

1173
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:29,181
the polls.
So what obama did is he wrote an entire 

1174
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:29,890
memoir and he just kind of dismissed it 
right in the middle of the memoir.

1175
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:30,280
He goes,
you know,

1176
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,870
when I was in high school,
I did a little bloke,

1177
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:32,710
no problem.

1178
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,310
Did a little blow everybody and 
everyone.

1179
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,380
Oh okay.
Did low blow,

1180
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,010
alright,
you know,

1181
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:41,110
cool.
So if you're going to release this kind 

1182
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:41,110
of stuff,
you have to put a spin on it.

1183
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:45,240
Trump juNior,
didn't he just put out the emails and 

1184
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:45,240
the emails themselves contain the 
damning material,

1185
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,360
right?
It says right in there,

1186
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,070
you know,
there's a russian government lawyer,

1187
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:53,190
the russian government sees this as part
of its effort to aid mr trump's 

1188
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:56,161
campaign.
And donald jr is like thumbs up guys 

1189
00:47:56,161 --> 00:47:56,161
like I love it.
sounds awesome.

1190
00:47:56,161 --> 00:47:58,150
And,
and so that does not look good.

1191
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,420
it's not quite as much as you know.
People on the left want to say it as 

1192
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,021
meaning that there's no evidence yet 
that any information was actually 

1193
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:07,330
exchanged with the russians or that 
anything came of the meeting.

1194
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:12,450
Most of the people in the meeting who 
said something and said nothing came of 

1195
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:15,121
it,
but we don't know whether trump knew 

1196
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:15,121
about the meeting.

1197
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:15,121
I find it kind of hard to believe he 
didn't,

1198
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:19,110
you know,
considering every major campaign figure 

1199
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:19,110
was there but,
but then then they,

1200
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,910
then they just keep lying and this,
this is the part that's,

1201
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:27,210
that's a problem.
Are they lyIng because they just think 

1202
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,241
they can get away with it anD they're 
stupid or they lying because they're 

1203
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:30,241
actually being meticulous about their 
allies.

1204
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:35,040
And I Tend to think the former,
because this isn't a professional 

1205
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,040
administration.
I think these,

1206
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,180
I think trump fibs a lot.
He says things that are,

1207
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,460
I mean like on stupid things.
He says things like,

1208
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,220
the leader of the boy scouts called me 
and told me that he loved my specialist,

1209
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,900
whichever,
and then leader of the boy scouts,

1210
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:44,360
like,
uh,

1211
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,350
what?
So,

1212
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:50,610
so is that a calculated lie to hide 
something or is it just the trump lies 

1213
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:51,250
by nature and so he does it a lot,
but I think he's just so used to it

1214
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:55,050
putting that spin on things that 
publicity span.

1215
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:00,080
Right.
And the thing that he said about this 

1216
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:00,990
was it,
this is what politics is what happens in

1217
00:49:00,991 --> 00:49:04,290
politics.
You get dirt about your enemy and people

1218
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:06,150
exchange inFormation.
It's just what happens.

1219
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,310
It's just you're seeing it now.
So a lot of people like.

1220
00:49:08,311 --> 00:49:09,210
Yeah,
well that makes sense.

1221
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:09,390
Right?

1222
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,980
And,
and this is something that again,

1223
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,630
I think that were shaped by hollywood a 
little bit.

1224
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,720
Politics is dirty,
but some of this stuff is not usual,

1225
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:21,140
right?
It's actually not particularly usual to 

1226
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,881
meet with a government that is really 
not friendly to the United States to 

1227
00:49:22,881 --> 00:49:24,060
receive information about your political
opponents.

1228
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,010
But if you've watched house of cards,
you think,

1229
00:49:26,011 --> 00:49:31,011
well,
I mean it's like two steps down from 

1230
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:31,011
throwing somebody under the subway.
So what's the big deal?

1231
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:34,670
Uh,
I don't because I work in politics and 

1232
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,041
when I go home at night,
the last thing I want to do is watch 

1233
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:37,041
entertainment about politics.
Now watch game of thrones.

1234
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:37,041
That's his political.
Okay.

1235
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,000
House of cards is a great show.
But if it's half right?

1236
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:46,270
Like I always wonder the thiNg,
the thing that gets me is when people 

1237
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,280
suicide themselves that are on their waY
to try out,

1238
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:48,770
I'm like,
okay,

1239
00:49:48,771 --> 00:49:53,771
I don'T want to be that fucking guy.
I don't want to be that tin foil hat 

1240
00:49:53,771 --> 00:49:54,470
guy.
But how many people are going to suicide

1241
00:49:54,471 --> 00:49:55,970
themselves?
I mean,

1242
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:00,230
for sure someone's been murdered 
somewhere along the line.

1243
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:05,231
Someone knew something,
some powerful people got to them and 

1244
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:05,231
they murder him.
Oh,

1245
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:06,200
it's gonna happen.
It has happened.

1246
00:50:06,201 --> 00:50:06,830
It must've had.

1247
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:09,280
I mean,
I think it happens a lot in Russia.

1248
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:12,130
I don't think that.
I don't believe what trump said.

1249
00:50:12,131 --> 00:50:17,131
And again,
I think this is why trump has a skewed 

1250
00:50:17,131 --> 00:50:18,991
vision of what politics is and because 
he thinks that the outer limit of 

1251
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:20,530
politics is Russia.
He thinks any thing inside that limit is

1252
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:25,531
now okay.
But do you think it's ever happened in 

1253
00:50:25,531 --> 00:50:25,531
the United States or just in Russia?
Like political assassinations?

1254
00:50:25,531 --> 00:50:27,470
Uh,
I can't name a specific example of where

1255
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:28,190
it has.
I think that.

1256
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,580
Are you open to the possibility?
I'm open to.

1257
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,120
I mean,
if someone shows me man johnson,

1258
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,850
lyndon johnson.
Did you pick somebody?

1259
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,530
And I don't think lyndon johnson whacked
anybody about kennedy.

1260
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,370
I don't think that kennedy whacked 
anybody,

1261
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,350
but hillary,
uh,

1262
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,230
I don't think hillary clinton

1263
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,270
the fiat up.
If I had my last thousand bucks,

1264
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,910
I'd be supeR tempted to bet on black.
I'd be super tempted to go.

1265
00:50:48,911 --> 00:50:50,920
You know what?
I think She went dark.

1266
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,790
She's whacked a few people.
Let's see what we've got here.

1267
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,120
Like I want to see white water.
I'd want to see vince foster.

1268
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,640
I want to see that enron guy who shot 
himself in the head twice.

1269
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,270
If I could,
if I could really,

1270
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,190
I could.
You know,

1271
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,110
man,
I think it's happened,

1272
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:09,100
I just don't know.

1273
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,890
I'm sure at some point,
but again,

1274
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,610
if I don't know if one,
when I'm hesitant to,

1275
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:18,050
I think that we and I think that we tend
to think things are regular when they 

1276
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:18,050
are,
they never really irregular,

1277
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:22,980
right?
So we tend to think that this stuff is 

1278
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:22,980
happening every day and that's why you 
see trump on tv saying,

1279
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,510
well putin,
like America hasn't killed people.

1280
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,590
And it's like,
well no,

1281
00:51:25,591 --> 00:51:30,591
not quite like putin.
I mean like putting legitimately 

1282
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:30,591
murders.
His,

1283
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:33,050
his journalistic enemies.
I haven't seen you trying to double tap 

1284
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:33,870
jake tapper,
so I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure.

1285
00:51:33,871 --> 00:51:35,400
no,
it's not a regular thing around here.

1286
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,980
Even obama wasn't trying to like kill 
chris wallace.

1287
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,310
Right.
But maybe the,

1288
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:42,820
you know,
maybe I don't know what boot is.

1289
00:51:42,821 --> 00:51:44,530
Obviously the extreme example,
right?

1290
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,710
Well obviously the extreme example is a 
North Korea,

1291
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:52,570
but putin is in that range of,
it's like a totally feared,

1292
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,550
essentially a dictator who's a,

1293
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:55,550
I mean there are a bunch of them,
right?

1294
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:57,430
I mean airline in Turkey.
Uh,

1295
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,350
sure.
The maduro a song,

1296
00:51:59,360 --> 00:51:59,830
a.
Yeah.

1297
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:04,940
Assad now in Venezuela who's literally 
like a complete dictatorship,

1298
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,600
and this is very recently,
but America is a.

1299
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:13,870
I mean,
would you believe it if I said like 

1300
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:14,210
leaders in France had people regularly 
whacked and find it a little bit hard to

1301
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:19,211
believe?
I don't think we're significantly worse 

1302
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:21,161
than France and the whacking people in 
politics business I don't think 

1303
00:52:21,161 --> 00:52:23,981
regularly,
but I think every now and then the move 

1304
00:52:23,981 --> 00:52:24,500
is I'm open to the possibility that I'd 
have to see the evidence.

1305
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:29,700
The lawyer in me.
Well I don't think we're a house of 

1306
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:29,700
cards.
I don't think it's gets that ridiculous,

1307
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,710
but the point I'm making is if you think
that's a regular thing,

1308
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:33,350
if you think that it not like a rare 
thing and maybe once in a while,

1309
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:38,351
you know,
once every 20 years somebody gets 

1310
00:52:38,351 --> 00:52:39,821
whacked quietly for political reasons.
If you think that's like a regular 

1311
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:42,761
thing,
then fibbing is like way inside the 

1312
00:52:42,761 --> 00:52:42,761
line.
Right?

1313
00:52:42,761 --> 00:52:43,160
Right.
Like you hiding documents is really.

1314
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:48,490
Or are you like writing your son's 
stupid statement about a stupid email 

1315
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:49,370
exchange and then fitting about it 
publicly.

1316
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:51,560
Like that's really inside the line.
So again,

1317
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:53,370
I don't think that,
I think some of this,

1318
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:55,370
I have a rule about the trump 
administration.

1319
00:52:55,371 --> 00:53:00,371
I never attribute to malevolence what I 
can attribute to stupidity because I 

1320
00:53:00,371 --> 00:53:01,670
think that that's more likely to be the 
case.

1321
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:03,850
It's like the outcomes razor of the 
trumpet.

1322
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:09,150
I think that is a smart way to think.
But I think sometimes malevolence is 

1323
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:12,901
real.
I remember the gary condit chandra levy 

1324
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:12,901
thing.
Yeah,

1325
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:16,441
that was weird.
that was a weird one for people don't 

1326
00:53:16,441 --> 00:53:16,540
know the story.
This guy was having an affair.

1327
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:21,541
The girl turned up dead and then nine 
slash 11 happened right away afterwards,

1328
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:23,990
so people kind of forgot about it,
but they.

1329
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,400
They found her body,
the park and everybody was like,

1330
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:31,401
jesus christ.
Like this is a woman that was about to 

1331
00:53:31,401 --> 00:53:34,881
testify that she was having an affair 
with this guy and that one was a good 

1332
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:36,960
one in terms of not a.
Not a good one.

1333
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:37,770
Obviously a terrible

1334
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,620
in terms of.
So let me say this.

1335
00:53:39,621 --> 00:53:42,290
I think that if there's murder and 
politics that will probably tend to fall

1336
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:43,880
more into the personal and the 
political.

1337
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,950
It'll probably fall less in terms of 
like,

1338
00:53:45,951 --> 00:53:48,470
I have a political vendetta against this
guy and I'm going to kill him.

1339
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:51,740
We haven't really done much of that 
since Alexander Hamilton and burr.

1340
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:52,930
Um,
but it's.

1341
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,300
But there are.
I mean,

1342
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:59,350
listen,
teddy kennedy left a woman in the back 

1343
00:53:59,350 --> 00:53:59,350
of his car and a body of water,
so.

1344
00:53:59,350 --> 00:53:59,350
Right.
Drunk driving.

1345
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:00,470
Right.
That was the thing with him.

1346
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:03,050
He just didn't want to be responsible 
for something horrible that he did.

1347
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:08,080
Right.
Similar to dick cheney not meeting with 

1348
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,100
the police for like something like 18 
hours after he shot his friend in the 

1349
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:12,100
face.

1350
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:12,100
Yeah.
I mean,

1351
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:17,061
I don't think he was trying to 
assassinate his friend is drunk hunting 

1352
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:17,061
and that's it.
Yeah.

1353
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:18,990
Yeah.
I would imagine.

1354
00:54:18,991 --> 00:54:20,100
I can't rule that one out,
so.

1355
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:22,860
Yeah.
But I mean,

1356
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:28,430
honestly,
I'll fantastic kennedy a little more 

1357
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:29,811
suspicious.
You leave the woman in the back of the 

1358
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:29,811
car,
swim out of the car,

1359
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:29,811
go into a house,
sleep,

1360
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:30,780
come back the next day and oh my god,
she's dead.

1361
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:31,380
Well,
yeah,

1362
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:33,690
it turns out when you leave somebody 
underwater for 12 hours,

1363
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:36,030
they tend to do that.
It's weird how that works

1364
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,590
well less.
He was so drunk that he didn't know what

1365
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,120
he was doing,
which can happen.

1366
00:54:40,121 --> 00:54:42,610
You can get black out drunk or you wake 
up and you go,

1367
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:44,260
wait a minute.
Did I crash my car

1368
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,200
so I don't drink that heavily.
Is that really a thing?

1369
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:47,870
Like he climbed out the window,
the card,

1370
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,820
swim out to the river bank,
go to somebodies house,

1371
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:54,630
come back like a day later you're like,
oh shit.

1372
00:54:54,631 --> 00:54:56,020
There was a girl in the backseat.

1373
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:58,490
I've never had it happen,
but I have had.

1374
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:04,030
I've had what I would call slide nights,
know where I get hammered and then like 

1375
00:55:05,481 --> 00:55:08,250
a wake up in the morning with a pounding
headache and is,

1376
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:11,420
have these flashes in my head like,
who is that person?

1377
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,700
Like where was I?
Where were we?

1378
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:14,720
Oh yeah,
there was that.

1379
00:55:14,721 --> 00:55:16,590
And then that you'll eat breakfast with 
your friends that go.

1380
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,660
You remember that thing?
And you go,

1381
00:55:17,661 --> 00:55:19,430
oh yeah,
jesus,

1382
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:25,920
not necessarily blackout like I did 
something horrible and I completely 

1383
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,480
forgot about it,
but I forgot a lot of it.

1384
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,780
But some people,
I have a friend and he goes,

1385
00:55:29,781 --> 00:55:34,781
job allies,
there's a switch that goes off three or 

1386
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:36,720
four shots in and he,
he's gone and he's not there anymore and

1387
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:41,740
you almost kinda like nerf the world 
around him and protect him and get him 

1388
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:41,740
in his bed and he wakes up in the 
morning,

1389
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:46,331
he doesn't know a thing,
doesn't know a thing about what 

1390
00:55:46,331 --> 00:55:46,331
happened.

1391
00:55:46,331 --> 00:55:47,040
And it's really bizarre.
It's illegitimate,

1392
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,520
terrible things to him.
Know I wasn't nice to him.

1393
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:54,521
But your instinct is to get the fuck 
away from him and he just let horrible 

1394
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,780
things happen.
But,

1395
00:55:56,781 --> 00:55:58,670
uh,
the stories are legendary,

1396
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,620
but he does,
he gets sharp eyes.

1397
00:56:00,621 --> 00:56:05,621
He gets these black,
like soulless eyes where he's gone and 

1398
00:56:05,621 --> 00:56:05,621
you go,
oh no,

1399
00:56:05,621 --> 00:56:06,650
he's gone.
Yeah,

1400
00:56:06,651 --> 00:56:08,990
it's weird.
But I'm wondering what that is.

1401
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,770
I feel like that's a neurological issue.
I feel like if,

1402
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,800
if alcohol does that to you,
there's probably some switches that 

1403
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,380
aren't connected right in the head.
I imagined a seven gun on,

1404
00:56:18,381 --> 00:56:19,820
you know?
Yeah.

1405
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,290
So teddy kennedy,
who knows,

1406
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,030
I mean he was obviously a raging

1407
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,050
and that could have been a part of the 
problem.

1408
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:27,850
I mean he literally might have gone 
home,

1409
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,770
not even knowing that he killed 
somebody.

1410
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,120
I mean I'd have to be as,
and it's only defense.

1411
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:37,190
So you imagine.
Well that was one of the things that 

1412
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:39,841
they said that they would have used as a
defense against with oj the oj with the 

1413
00:56:39,841 --> 00:56:44,810
cte,
that he might not have even known what 

1414
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,221
he was doing,
that he might have flown into some 

1415
00:56:47,221 --> 00:56:47,290
blackout rage.
That would be an amazing defense.

1416
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:52,470
Like I would like to hear that,
like everyone who has cte now gets to 

1417
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,051
like run around chopping up their ex 
wife and randos who end up at their 

1418
00:56:55,051 --> 00:56:55,400
house like that.
That'd be a hell of a defense.

1419
00:56:55,401 --> 00:56:56,560
Sort of like the twinkie defense,
right?

1420
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,930
yeah.
Well the twinkie defense was hilarious,

1421
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:04,080
but there are people that think that 
they're going to see more and more 

1422
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:08,500
things like that at a former nfl players
with massive brain trauma issues.

1423
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,930
It's actually a serious legal question.
You know,

1424
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:15,950
like there was a couple of weeks ago 
this kid doesn't even know he did this.

1425
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,290
Oh god.
Oh wow.

1426
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:22,470
Former nfl player.
Devonne hall accused of kIlling his 

1427
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:22,470
mother.
He doesn't remember.

1428
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:22,960
He's in jail right now.
Doesn't recall.

1429
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:24,910
Oh yeah.
Well that's real.

1430
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,390
It's mean.
Yeah.

1431
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:31,410
I don't find that wildly implausible 
that the fact is that we have an 

1432
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:33,670
insanity defense and what it means you 
don't know right from wrong.

1433
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:34,510
Well,
if you don't know what you're doing,

1434
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,520
like this is something they teach in law
school.

1435
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:41,521
If you're sleepwalking,
he kill somebody and there's no motive 

1436
00:57:41,521 --> 00:57:44,880
sets.
It's difficult to like you need mental 

1437
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:44,880
treatment but it should.
You be in jail for that.

1438
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:44,880
Not,
not really.

1439
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,531
I mean they've had cases where people 
are like sleepwalking and they think 

1440
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:52,621
that in their dreaming at the same time.
So they think that their wife is 

1441
00:57:52,621 --> 00:57:54,811
actually like this defense has been used
where they think they're the wife of 

1442
00:57:54,811 --> 00:57:54,811
some sort of monster in the room.

1443
00:57:54,811 --> 00:57:57,340
So they clobbered to death and then they
wake up and like,

1444
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,660
oh,
that was my wife.

1445
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,540
It's a really creative defense or it's 
true.

1446
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,360
I mean,
one of the toe so well,

1447
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:08,370
if we know that people can go crazy and 
we know that brain trauma is a real 

1448
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:09,160
issue,
the two of them together,

1449
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:13,900
I mean there's something about getting 
knocked around in the head where it's so

1450
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:18,901
completely unpredictable and then you 
add in this impulsive nature of their 

1451
00:58:18,901 --> 00:58:22,771
behavior that happens.
There's something really weird about a 

1452
00:58:22,771 --> 00:58:25,240
brain trauma.
It causes a lot of very strange,

1453
00:58:25,241 --> 00:58:30,241
impulsive behavior in people with.
They really can't understand even why 

1454
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:31,000
they're behaving the way they're 
behaving.

1455
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,660
Just not good.
Obviously this is way off track,

1456
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,740
but it's far from politics to brand 
trauma.

1457
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:41,620
You don't want a former nfl player being
the fucking president.

1458
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,050
So that's.
They did a cte study.

1459
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:48,280
There was a hundred and 11 players and 
110 of them had cte.

1460
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,440
I mean,
then you tell me,

1461
00:58:50,441 --> 00:58:50,680
I mean,
you,

1462
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:51,760
you have more experience at this.
I mean,

1463
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,150
I didn't find that shocking at all.
I mean they've been calling people punch

1464
00:58:54,151 --> 00:58:57,580
drunk since 1910 and so we'll see.
The thing is,

1465
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:02,850
when you get to that,
when you get to the slurring your words 

1466
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:02,850
part,
you're so gone,

1467
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:08,010
you're already gone.
There's a lot of people that have cte 

1468
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:11,071
that speak really well and they're very 
articulate and they're very reasonable 

1469
00:59:11,071 --> 00:59:13,360
and you wouldn't even understand that 
they're dealing with all these,

1470
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:18,010
this host of neurological issues.
The by the time you avoid,

1471
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:23,040
obviously I'm not a neuRologist,
but by the time this has been explained 

1472
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:23,040
me,
your voice

1473
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,250
is slurring and you're dealing with like
real heavy duty symptoms like you're 

1474
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:28,910
fucked.
Like you're so gone.

1475
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,110
Like you're,
you're,

1476
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,820
you're,
you're way off.

1477
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,660
Here's a weird question for you.
I mean,

1478
00:59:33,661 --> 00:59:34,920
what,
what would you do about like,

1479
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,990
I think the nfl is gonna start losing 
viewers because of us.

1480
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,420
I think they are.
I think you're right and you know,

1481
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:40,710
I wonder about mma.

1482
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,510
It's a factor.
I think there's a,

1483
00:59:43,511 --> 00:59:48,511
there's two things going on.
There's the bucket factor where people 

1484
00:59:48,511 --> 00:59:48,511
like,
I don't care.

1485
00:59:48,511 --> 00:59:48,511
I want to watch people get their ass 
kicked.

1486
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:49,780
It's fun.
It's exciting.

1487
00:59:49,781 --> 00:59:51,760
People love it.
It's consensual.

1488
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,990
It's primal.
Yeah,

1489
00:59:52,991 --> 00:59:54,970
and people know what they're signing up 
for when they do it,

1490
00:59:54,971 --> 00:59:59,971
they know the consequences of it and 
it's worth the glory to be the guy who 

1491
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:00,970
delivers it versus the guy who receives 
it.

1492
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:06,420
So I think there's that,
but then there's also look the colin 

1493
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,180
kaepernick thing,
I think that

1494
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:10,300
probably costs a lot of ratings for the 
nfl.

1495
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:15,920
Did that poll that came out that said,
I think of the 12 percent of people who 

1496
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,050
said that they were not watching nfl 
games last year,

1497
01:00:17,051 --> 01:00:22,051
28 percent of that,
12 percent said that the cabernet 

1498
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:22,051
national anthem thing was the reason.
Yeah,

1499
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:26,931
I mean it.
Some small percentage probably 

1500
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:28,441
emboldened them.
They probably liked it and they wanted 

1501
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:30,451
to watch it more.
This is fascinating about the cultural 

1502
01:00:30,451 --> 01:00:32,431
breakdown of the country.
Basically white people hated black 

1503
01:00:32,431 --> 01:00:32,431
people loved it.
This is it.

1504
01:00:32,431 --> 01:00:36,250
This is how the polls where it's like 72
percent of black people thought it was 

1505
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,911
great and like an equal percentage of 
white people thought that it was just 

1506
01:00:38,911 --> 01:00:38,911
terrible,
which is,

1507
01:00:38,911 --> 01:00:43,160
which is a fascinating look at it.
Sort of how race relations work in the 

1508
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,230
country at large is it?
It'S actually one of the reasons I think

1509
01:00:44,231 --> 01:00:49,231
that espn has been losing ratings.
Like I used to watch espn religiously 

1510
01:00:49,231 --> 01:00:49,231
and now I,
I,

1511
01:00:49,231 --> 01:00:53,460
all I want is to just watch my sports 
and not Be bothered with the politics 

1512
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,730
because I say I do that during the day.
It's a pet peeve of mine and every time 

1513
01:00:56,730 --> 01:01:00,061
I turn on espn I have to lecture about 
caitlyn jenner or about black lives 

1514
01:01:00,061 --> 01:01:00,061
matter.
It's like shut up.

1515
01:01:00,061 --> 01:01:02,740
Caitlin jenner hasn't even been 
athletically relevant fOr since before I

1516
01:01:02,741 --> 01:01:04,210
was born.
I was born in 1984.

1517
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:07,350
Well the caitlyn jenner piece,
when they did it for espn,

1518
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:12,680
and I don't know if this is true or not,
but the word was that her getting 

1519
01:01:12,781 --> 01:01:17,781
athlete of the year or whatever the 
award was like the hero of the year 

1520
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:22,611
award arrow a was directly tied to the 
exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer.

1521
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:29,910
That makes sense.
They sold the two of them together as a 

1522
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:29,910
package deal,
which I buy a hundred percent and if you

1523
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,500
don't,
if you don't,

1524
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,590
come on.
Let's think about where he works,

1525
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,830
if that's the case.
She came from.

1526
01:01:34,831 --> 01:01:36,780
She's a fucking car dash 10.
Okay.

1527
01:01:36,781 --> 01:01:38,620
She's a giant kardashians.
Right?

1528
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:42,630
That's what she is now known as.
I'm saying she saying she,

1529
01:01:42,631 --> 01:01:44,550
I would say very politically correct and
I'm not.

1530
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:49,770
Um,
but the video where they circled her 

1531
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,570
house and she was like moving and the 
shadows behind the drapes.

1532
01:01:51,571 --> 01:01:53,040
Did you ever see that?
No,

1533
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,500
it was wonderful.
It was wOnderful.

1534
01:01:55,650 --> 01:02:00,650
She made,
it was like the first time she was 

1535
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,710
revealing herself as this woman.
So they're circling her house.

1536
01:02:01,711 --> 01:02:06,711
She's this gloria's house and looks like
it's in malibu or somewhere where 

1537
01:02:06,711 --> 01:02:08,640
they're circling the house and it's in 
the hills with helicopter,

1538
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:11,180
like filming I guess like fucking high 
production values.

1539
01:02:11,181 --> 01:02:12,870
Shit.
This isn't just like,

1540
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:13,860
hey,
you know,

1541
01:02:13,861 --> 01:02:15,690
we've met with caitlin and home.
Caitlin,

1542
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,900
tell us your troubles.
You know,

1543
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:19,110
like kristen beck,
the former navy

1544
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,140
who just sits down very reasonably and 
says,

1545
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,050
this just feels better for me.
This is who I am right now.

1546
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:29,280
Know that there was like curtains and 
shadows and it was mysterious.

1547
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:31,440
And then she starts talking.
I was like,

1548
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:32,110
wow,
are all.

1549
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:35,010
I'm like,
oh god.

1550
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,860
And then there was a weird,
the weirdest part where she said she got

1551
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:41,400
surgery,
but it doesn't make me any.

1552
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:46,700
I was.
It wasn't like I was any less of a man 

1553
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,030
or less of a woman before the surgery.
Well,

1554
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,420
this is the case is about gender,
right?

1555
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:49,830
Well,
why get the surgery?

1556
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:54,831
That was like this as well.
There are a lot of questions as to the 

1557
01:02:54,831 --> 01:02:56,310
logic of all of this.
I get you call it caitlyn jenner sheet.

1558
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:59,470
Caitlyn jenner is a biological man.
Sorry.

1559
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:04,480
That triggered sat.
Sorry to break this to some of the all 

1560
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:04,480
the people who listened to your show.

1561
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:04,480
Caitlyn jenner.
Is it like.

1562
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,251
I had a tweet this week.
All the people that listen to probably 

1563
01:03:09,251 --> 01:03:10,410
agree with you at least a good good 
amount to the number one retweet a tweet

1564
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:15,411
I have ever had.
Had 100 and I tweeted I think a day ago 

1565
01:03:15,411 --> 01:03:16,210
and it has 120,000
lakes and it's.

1566
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:21,220
It was,
there was a headline from cnn that said 

1567
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,400
transgender man gives birth to a 
transient lesbians,

1568
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:27,440
transgender man,
a signed the female sex at birth gives 

1569
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,370
birth to a healthy baby boy,
and so I tweeted,

1570
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:32,130
woman gives birth to a boy because it's 
a woman.

1571
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,320
I mean like that's not a headline.
I'm sorry,

1572
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:36,800
like I'm just.
Because the woman believes she's a man,

1573
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,840
doesn't make her a man.
Like biology still exists.

1574
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,900
Sex still exists.
If you want to say she's a woman who 

1575
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:44,900
feels like a man,
that's fine.

1576
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,861
If you want to say that and by that I 
don't even care if she gets the hormone 

1577
01:03:48,861 --> 01:03:48,861
treatments or if she wants to have 
surgery,

1578
01:03:48,861 --> 01:03:50,550
like it's a free country,
what the hell you want,

1579
01:03:50,551 --> 01:03:53,310
but when you start insisting that I use 
that,

1580
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:55,470
I just throw biology out the window.

1581
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I don't understand why that's any better
than it is a religious person saying 

1582
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,410
every time you say something you have to
mention god like,

1583
01:04:01,411 --> 01:04:06,411
well,
I don't have the right to do that to 

1584
01:04:06,411 --> 01:04:06,411
you.
Like what the fuck?

1585
01:04:06,411 --> 01:04:07,650
Are you fascinated by it?
Are you fascinated by the transgender?

1586
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,340
The I'm fascinated by this obsession 
with it.

1587
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,050
Yes.
That's a good way of saying it.

1588
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:17,250
There's not just a an obsession.
It's,

1589
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:23,350
it's compulsory and it's rabid.
So I think that there's a couple of 

1590
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:24,960
things that are going on.
One is that it's very dark,

1591
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:27,120
but I think that there is an element of 
like,

1592
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:30,210
this is different and we get to.
We get to revel in the,

1593
01:04:30,211 --> 01:04:32,550
in the weirdness of it,
but we're going to pretend that it's all

1594
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:33,960
about the civil rights of it,
right?

1595
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:35,360
We're going to feel special because 
we're,

1596
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:35,820
we're,
we're.

1597
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:37,260
Because we're on their side,
right?

1598
01:04:37,261 --> 01:04:42,261
When we're not watching caitlyn jenner 
because it's a curiosity and because 

1599
01:04:42,261 --> 01:04:45,381
it's weird and entertaining,
we're doing it because we're on caitlyn 

1600
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,080
jenner's side,
but they're feeling really good about 

1601
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:48,080
people forever.
Right.

1602
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:48,080
I mean,
renee richards was a trans person.

1603
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:50,460
It's happened throughout history.
I mean there's,

1604
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:55,490
there's.
What was I reading a couple of days ago 

1605
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:58,941
about a roman,
like there was something about reports 

1606
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:03,630
of some trans soldier in the roman army 
born a thousand years ago.

1607
01:05:03,631 --> 01:05:08,631
it's got to be.
If it exists now and it's existed 

1608
01:05:08,631 --> 01:05:08,631
before.
It was popular.

1609
01:05:08,631 --> 01:05:09,570
Yeah,
I mean there's got to be a lot of people

1610
01:05:09,571 --> 01:05:11,580
that turn trans now just because it's 
exciting.

1611
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,030
Oh,
there it is.

1612
01:05:12,031 --> 01:05:14,220
Right there.
A trans soldier in the ancient roman.

1613
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:17,520
Of course it wouldn't be.
WouldN't be surprised.

1614
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:18,060
Not

1615
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,800
shocked.
I mean it's a condition.

1616
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:25,870
I mean the been called gender identity 
disorder and then they called it gender 

1617
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:25,870
dysphoria.
It's a condition.

1618
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:30,650
I mean like I'm not saying conditions 
for and but that in a lot of people's 

1619
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:33,550
mind is labeling it somehow or a 
negative.

1620
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:39,060
Well,
I mean it is highly linked to 

1621
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,521
suicidality.
There's a 40 percent lifetime suicide 

1622
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:41,521
rate for people who have this particular
gender disorder.

1623
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,180
That seems to me not to be like a great 
positive.

1624
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:45,670
Whether or not they transition whether 
or not the transition.

1625
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:50,671
Yeah.
I don't care if you transition to what 

1626
01:05:50,671 --> 01:05:50,671
you want to do,
but.

1627
01:05:50,671 --> 01:05:51,280
But the ideA that,
that we as an entire society,

1628
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:56,281
you have to redefine what sex is and we 
have to blind ourselves to a biology is 

1629
01:05:56,281 --> 01:05:59,551
this is something I'm not willing to do.
I think that it's actually damaging to 

1630
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,640
kids particularly more than willing to 
call her she and,

1631
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:02,770
but you can only change the name once.

1632
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,570
I'm willing to call caitlyn jenner,
caitlyn jenner.

1633
01:06:04,571 --> 01:06:07,570
I'm not willing to call caitlyn jenner 
issue because you can't change your sex.

1634
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:12,590
Can change your name,
you can change it into whatever you 

1635
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:12,590
want.
I don't care,

1636
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:12,590
but you can't.
She caitlyn jenner is not a chicken.

1637
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:14,980
Caitlyn jenner is not a woman.
Caitlin jenner is a man,

1638
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:20,100
a biological man,
and if a man lost his penis and it and 

1639
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:20,100
it,
you know,

1640
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:20,680
in a,
in a tragic accident,

1641
01:06:20,681 --> 01:06:25,681
it wouldn't make them a woman.
And if he were born with high doses of 

1642
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:26,050
estrogen in his bloodstream,
he would also not be a woman.

1643
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,440
You are determined by your chromosomes 
and it's not even talking about intersex

1644
01:06:29,441 --> 01:06:32,710
people like intersex is natural status.
Intersex is a biological status,

1645
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,920
but this nonsense that if you joe rogan 
decide tomorrow that you are a woman,

1646
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:40,470
no surgeries nor homeowner and the 
homeowner,

1647
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:40,840
nothing.

1648
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,180
You just,
tomorrow you wake up and not,

1649
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,920
not the side,
but you feel like a woman.

1650
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:47,800
Then you have always been a woman.
We must treat you as a woman.

1651
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:52,860
You don't have to change anything about 
yourself for us to even determine 

1652
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:52,860
whether you're a woman.
We just like,

1653
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:53,530
no,
I'm sorry.

1654
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:58,531
No,
I mean like I had mental illness and I 

1655
01:06:58,531 --> 01:06:58,570
had a grandfather I got,
I get so much shit for this,

1656
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:03,850
but I had.
This is not me being unsympathetic to 

1657
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,971
people who suffer from a condition that 
is really tragic and obviously harms 

1658
01:07:05,971 --> 01:07:05,971
people.
You know?

1659
01:07:05,971 --> 01:07:06,490
In terms of the.
Again,

1660
01:07:06,491 --> 01:07:08,860
the rates of suicide and depression are 
astoundinG.

1661
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,310
My,
my grandfather was a,

1662
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:16,350
was a bipolar schizophrenia and it would
have not been good for him or my family 

1663
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:17,320
if people had said to him,
nate,

1664
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:19,330
you're right,
the radio is talking to you,

1665
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,170
nate.

1666
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,760
You're right.
The curtains are talking to you.

1667
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:23,740
He Went and they put them in a mental 
hospital.

1668
01:07:23,741 --> 01:07:28,741
They gave them lithium and then he was 
Better and he could actually live a 

1669
01:07:28,741 --> 01:07:28,741
normal,
relatively happy life.

1670
01:07:28,741 --> 01:07:30,490
There's no good treatment for gender 
identity disorder,

1671
01:07:30,491 --> 01:07:31,870
gender dysphoria,
whatever you want to call it,

1672
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,920
but to suggest that it is a condition 
that doesn't require treatment there.

1673
01:07:35,921 --> 01:07:40,921
Really,
it's just that you're actually brain 

1674
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:40,921
female.
Again,

1675
01:07:40,921 --> 01:07:43,831
this is a scientific.
There's no scientific evidence to back 

1676
01:07:43,831 --> 01:07:46,501
this whatsoever.
Even these studies that have been done 

1677
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:46,501
talking about,
there's a female brain and a male brain.

1678
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:48,010
First of all,
if you say this to a feminist,

1679
01:07:48,011 --> 01:07:49,270
you're a sexist,
right?

1680
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,070
Right.
If you say to a feminist,

1681
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:56,100
there's a female brand in the male brain
and male brain works differently than 

1682
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:56,100
the female brain.
The feminists will look like,

1683
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:56,350
how dare you?

1684
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:01,560
Well,
it's also one of the rare times where 

1685
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,170
you're allowed to celebrate classic 
definitions of female beauty.

1686
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,200
When a man embraces somebody becomes a 
woman lipstick,

1687
01:08:05,201 --> 01:08:06,820
high heels,
short skirt.

1688
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:12,090
This is like caitlyn jenner was.
Caitlyn jenner was only a woman when 

1689
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:12,240
caitlyn jenner was on the cover of 
vanity fair to boost da.

1690
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,120
Right?
Right.

1691
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,800
But if he had just said,
listen,

1692
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,460
I look exactly the same as I did 
yesterday,

1693
01:08:16,461 --> 01:08:17,310
but I'm a woman.
Yeah.

1694
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:19,940
If you've got a short haircut and dress 
like billie Jean King,

1695
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:24,970
right?
It's the reason why the why the media 

1696
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:25,520
loves laverne cox because laverne cox 
has had surgeries and looks a lot like a

1697
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:28,730
woman.
So I don't know who the guy from.

1698
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:29,330
Uh,
well,

1699
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:31,880
the transgender woman from orange is the
new black.

1700
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,070
I never watched the show.
I've never watched that show either,

1701
01:08:34,071 --> 01:08:35,180
but she's on the cover of time magazine.

1702
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,100
Oh.
Or he's on the cover of time magazine.

1703
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,960
Well,
there was the woman in that show.

1704
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,750
Isn't that the one where the girl who 
ruby rose.

1705
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,050
Is that the girl that's laverne cox?
That's a woman or man,

1706
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:46,640
that's man.
I used to be a man.

1707
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:49,460
It used to be a man and a woman now.
Very tricky know still a man.

1708
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:51,980
But transgender tipping.
So out of the loop.

1709
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:57,190
I'm not old man.
I'm that old man was one that headline 

1710
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:57,190
there,
right?

1711
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:57,190
It says america's next civil rights 
frontier.

1712
01:08:57,190 --> 01:09:02,111
And that's the case.
Do you have a bunch of people in the 

1713
01:09:02,111 --> 01:09:02,120
United States who are suggesting that 
they want the next civil rights fight?

1714
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:03,560
Always the next civil rights fight,
right?

1715
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:08,960
The civil rights fight.
Does immigration or the civil rights 

1716
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:08,960
fight is gay marriage or the civil 
rights fight is transgenders.

1717
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,350
Okay.
How about this?

1718
01:09:09,351 --> 01:09:14,351
How about there was only one real civil 
rights fight and it was about black 

1719
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:16,481
people who had been historically 
oppressed in the United States for 200 

1720
01:09:16,481 --> 01:09:16,481
years.

1721
01:09:16,481 --> 01:09:18,380
There had been slaves who had been 
slaves and the transgenders.

1722
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:19,940
This is correct.
Okay.

1723
01:09:19,941 --> 01:09:24,941
The worst that caitlyn jenner had 
experienced as being incredibly wealthy 

1724
01:09:24,941 --> 01:09:24,941
in a,
in a,

1725
01:09:24,941 --> 01:09:27,410
in a high net worth suburb.
This transgender people don't,

1726
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:29,510
you know,
aren't discriminated against in some,

1727
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,490
in some areas of american life.
I'm sure that's true,

1728
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:36,730
but it's also like behavior is not the 
same as being born black or being born 

1729
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:41,050
asian or being born with,
you know,

1730
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,840
a disabled.
If,

1731
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:49,300
if I'm a business owner and I hire you 
and you're a man and you come in the 

1732
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:50,990
next day and you're dressed in a woman's
clothing saying you're a woman,

1733
01:09:50,991 --> 01:09:55,991
but you still have a full beard.
Like I don't see why I as a business 

1734
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:59,021
owner,
I'm expected to eat the cost of that 

1735
01:09:59,021 --> 01:09:59,021
like that.
It seems.

1736
01:09:59,021 --> 01:09:59,021
That seems bizarre to me.

1737
01:09:59,021 --> 01:10:00,600
Eat the costs is a great way to phrase 
it.

1738
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,330
I didn't have a dog in this fight.
I didn't.

1739
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:08,350
I,
I was completely open and liberal about 

1740
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:10,911
it until there was a case where a man 
who had been a man for 30 years became a

1741
01:10:11,821 --> 01:10:15,840
woman for a little less than two years 
and then started mma fighting women.

1742
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:16,600
YeS,
exactly.

1743
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:21,630
Exactly.
Getting the fuck out of these women and 

1744
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:24,230
shy and not prOclaiming that he or she 
used to be a man because what it in 

1745
01:10:26,551 --> 01:10:31,551
quotes,
it was a medical condition that I did 

1746
01:10:31,551 --> 01:10:31,551
not need to disclose.
Like that's not,

1747
01:10:31,551 --> 01:10:32,390
I'm fucking medical conditions.
Right.

1748
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:36,010
And if you ever watched the fights when 
Alan Fox,

1749
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,400
she wasn't winning because she was 
skillful.

1750
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,650
She was fucking manhandling handling 
these women.

1751
01:10:40,651 --> 01:10:42,660
It was ugly horse.
It was horrible.

1752
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:43,690
It's like this is.
But again,

1753
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,840
it's so funny how the transgender 
movement destroys the feminist movement 

1754
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,350
by living off of the,
the sort of lies that the feminist 

1755
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:55,411
movement promulgated to the feminist 
movement said stupid things like women 

1756
01:10:55,411 --> 01:10:56,630
and men equally athletic,
proficient with that

1757
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:01,410
repeated very recently that there's no 
biological difference in the genders and

1758
01:11:01,411 --> 01:11:02,280
it's all social.
That's

1759
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,660
absolute horseshit.
I mean,

1760
01:11:03,661 --> 01:11:08,661
I'm sorry.
There is no scientific evidence to back 

1761
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:11,391
that.
And it's particularly true with regard 

1762
01:11:11,391 --> 01:11:13,011
to actual physical capacity.
This is just nonsense that just no 

1763
01:11:13,011 --> 01:11:13,360
scientific evidence but a.
Yeah.

1764
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,520
Yeah.
I mean mountain of my favorite study on 

1765
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:18,520
this,
as you know,

1766
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:21,290
there was,
remember there was that those 

1767
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:21,290
commercials about like throwing like a 
girl running like a girl.

1768
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:25,040
Remember those feminist commercials 
saying what is it to be running like a 

1769
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,711
girl named shown an adult woman and 
she'd be running on early and then they 

1770
01:11:27,711 --> 01:11:28,410
would show little girl and she's running
and it's still a little girly,

1771
01:11:28,411 --> 01:11:29,460
but she's running,
you know,

1772
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,950
like normally it's only,
it's only exactly fierce.

1773
01:11:31,951 --> 01:11:34,560
It's the only society that has forced 
the little girl to run.

1774
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:35,190
Like when we.
First of all,

1775
01:11:35,191 --> 01:11:40,191
I have a three year old girl.
She runs like a girl second of all and 

1776
01:11:40,191 --> 01:11:44,941
it's not because I'm teaching her that 
because her mom runs cause she doesn't 

1777
01:11:44,941 --> 01:11:44,941
write,
but she played with dolls because you're

1778
01:11:44,941 --> 01:11:45,180
a sexist pig.

1779
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:46,210
It's because of that.
My,

1780
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:49,050
my daughter started off liking trucks 
like in the first year and I didn't give

1781
01:11:49,051 --> 01:11:54,051
a shit.
Now she likes playing with dolls and 

1782
01:11:54,051 --> 01:11:54,051
dressing up in princess dresses.
Like who cares?

1783
01:11:54,051 --> 01:11:54,051
She's a girl,
she's always been a girl.

1784
01:11:54,051 --> 01:11:55,850
She will always be a girl,
but that she likes trucks or whether she

1785
01:11:55,851 --> 01:11:57,720
likes.
It was an issue with one of my daughters

1786
01:11:57,721 --> 01:12:02,721
too.
My daughter was a little worried about 

1787
01:12:02,721 --> 01:12:02,721
argos,
she's going to be a dyke.

1788
01:12:02,721 --> 01:12:02,721
She was like,
no,

1789
01:12:02,721 --> 01:12:03,420
what's the big deal?
You like lesbians,

1790
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:04,830
who cares?
I don't care.

1791
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:06,990
I do not care.
And she's like,

1792
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:09,060
and then she turned the corner and then 
she got.

1793
01:12:09,061 --> 01:12:10,800
But we just let her be whatever she's 
in.

1794
01:12:10,801 --> 01:12:12,720
But she was really into like batman for 
awhile,

1795
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:18,010
but my daughter is in a.
And then she was into wonder woman like 

1796
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:18,010
who cares?

1797
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:19,020
But what's funny about this is that the 
left kept saying,

1798
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:20,730
even when I met my wife,
right,

1799
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,140
who's,
who's a conservative,

1800
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:24,330
and I made her more conservative when we
got married,

1801
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:26,940
because that's what men tend to do to 
their lives,

1802
01:12:26,941 --> 01:12:28,500
but she,
but she,

1803
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:31,800
I remember early on we had a 
conversation about this and I said,

1804
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:35,220
women don't throw like men and she got 
like all offended and I said,

1805
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:36,540
but that's factually true.
Said rigHt?

1806
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:37,560
But it's.
But it's insulting.

1807
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:38,310
It's like,
no,

1808
01:12:38,311 --> 01:12:41,120
that's factually true.
Like I'm sorry,

1809
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:44,100
like there've been studies out of a 
thousand,

1810
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:49,280
if you took a woman throwing a baseball 
and then a thousand men throwing a 

1811
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,491
baseball,
the woman will throw faster than out of 

1812
01:12:52,491 --> 01:12:52,491
those thousand men is in the book.
The sports gene,

1813
01:12:52,491 --> 01:12:56,120
the one who will throw faster than two 
of those men out of a thousand.

1814
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,110
And we're not talking about like goose 
gossage here.

1815
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:03,110
We're talking about,
we're talking about the accountant from 

1816
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,110
down the block.
We're talking about Paul Ryan flinging a

1817
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,280
baseball,
right?

1818
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:04,890
I mean,
that's not the way this stuff works.

1819
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:07,560
Well,
that was the counter that found fox used

1820
01:13:07,561 --> 01:13:12,561
was that she actually lost to a woman.
She lost a woman named ashley evan 

1821
01:13:12,561 --> 01:13:12,720
smith.
But what I said was,

1822
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:17,721
no,
this proves my point is that you're not 

1823
01:13:17,721 --> 01:13:17,721
good.
You're just a man.

1824
01:13:17,721 --> 01:13:21,860
well,
this was the john mcenroe got slapped 

1825
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:21,860
all over the lot when he saId about 
serena williams.

1826
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:22,890
She's great.
So one of them is great and all.

1827
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:28,070
But if serena williams were compete,
he said she's the best female player 

1828
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,070
ever.
And they were like,

1829
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,230
well,
why not just the best player ever?

1830
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:29,520
And he said,
because she's a woman,

1831
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,380
like if you were a man,
she'd get her ass kicked.

1832
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:33,210
And everyone was like,
no,

1833
01:13:33,211 --> 01:13:33,870
how dare you.

1834
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:39,080
There is something called the universal 
tennis ranking should rank in the mid 

1835
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,940
ranks of college male players.
If you were a man and serena williams,

1836
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:45,950
It's like five years ago now.
I never want to play with like andy 

1837
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:45,950
roddick.
He'd kill me.

1838
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:49,430
She actually did this.
there was a 200th rank man in the world 

1839
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:52,040
who she wanted to just warm up with and 
they played a like just a normal match 

1840
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,200
for a one,
six,

1841
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:54,570
one six,
nothing right.

1842
01:13:54,571 --> 01:13:57,480
And he was and he was like ranked 200th 
in the world and the only shock was that

1843
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:59,010
he dropped a,
dropped a point to her.

1844
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,320
Well,
there was the issue of renee richards,

1845
01:14:01,321 --> 01:14:06,321
when renee richards started playing 
tennis against women and kicking their 

1846
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:09,441
ass and he was a middling player at best
as a woman or as a man rather.

1847
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:12,100
But as a woman,
he was a fucking killer.

1848
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:15,050
Hey,
this is what you didn't solve.

1849
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:16,390
Feminists.
It turns out the caitlyn jenner,

1850
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:21,391
when all these hero of the year awards 
and everything we met are so great that 

1851
01:14:21,391 --> 01:14:21,970
even when we decided to be women were 
better than women.

1852
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:26,971
I was a woman for six months.
He's amazing and incredible addict.

1853
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,330
He's just using natural.
He's a gold member.

1854
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:34,350
Better even at being women than women.
They know wonder feminists are pissed 

1855
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:34,350
and they should be.
And,

1856
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:38,191
and this whole glossing over the 
difference between feminists who have 

1857
01:14:38,191 --> 01:14:41,551
been claiming that women are distinct 
from men and important and different and

1858
01:14:41,681 --> 01:14:46,681
better in certain ways.
Like I don't understand how you hold 

1859
01:14:46,681 --> 01:14:48,571
these two simultaneous thought.
Hillary clinton needs to be president 

1860
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:48,670
because we need a female president,
but also Donald Trump,

1861
01:14:48,671 --> 01:14:50,350
if he said he was a woman,
tomorrow would be a woman.

1862
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,700
How Do you hold those two simultaneous 
thought?

1863
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:57,900
I always thought that in the last week 
of the election of trump thought he was 

1864
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,211
gonna lose.
He should have just declared himself a 

1865
01:15:00,211 --> 01:15:00,211
woman and then he too could have run the
first female president.

1866
01:15:00,211 --> 01:15:04,550
I would have been incredible trailer if 
he just showed up on the dress and the 

1867
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:04,550
entire left

1868
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:06,670
fires a woman.
I'm the best looking woman ever.

1869
01:15:06,671 --> 01:15:11,671
I've been.
I've been voted as the best looking 

1870
01:15:11,671 --> 01:15:13,141
woman of all time.
Great arguments that I got it online 

1871
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:18,300
when wasn't even arguments and put it so
many people were calling me a bigot 

1872
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:18,300
because of this fallon fox thing.
It was.

1873
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,080
It was stunning because it was so 
confusing to me.

1874
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:23,530
I'm like,
I'm talking about defending a biological

1875
01:15:23,531 --> 01:15:26,020
woman,
like these biological women,

1876
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:31,021
at least two of them got the fuck beaten
out of them by found fox before they 

1877
01:15:31,021 --> 01:15:33,250
found out that she used to be a man.
I'm like,

1878
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:36,460
that's not an issue to these people,
and so this one woman said,

1879
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:38,290
she's always been a woman,
and I said,

1880
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:40,240
okay.
She gave birth.

1881
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:43,150
She impregnated a woman and got her 
pregnant.

1882
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:44,070
I go,
what about that?

1883
01:15:44,071 --> 01:15:46,410
And she goes,
even then he didn't.

1884
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:47,260
Then she was a woman.

1885
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:52,260
She was a woman.
She went and she was fucking a woman 

1886
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,301
with her dick and getting that woman 
pregnant like we are in fantasy land.

1887
01:15:55,070 --> 01:16:00,070
It's crazy town,
but this doesn't mean this is what's 

1888
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:03,031
crazy.
Like yOu can't just because something's 

1889
01:16:03,031 --> 01:16:05,431
a logical.
You can't just decide that someone's a 

1890
01:16:05,431 --> 01:16:07,420
bigot like you were in a weird area.
We're talking about bone structure and 

1891
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:09,350
here's the crazy thing.
ToDay they are.

1892
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:14,020
Here's the crazy thing is that they 
always rely on these gender reassignment

1893
01:16:14,021 --> 01:16:18,280
doctors to define the terms and it's 
really interesting because I got deep,

1894
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:23,281
deep,
deep into the rabbit hole with this 

1895
01:16:23,281 --> 01:16:24,841
because I was really shocked at how many
people were angry at me and there was 

1896
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:28,921
one doctor who is a board certified 
endocrinologist who's sort of broke it 

1897
01:16:28,921 --> 01:16:28,921
down.
She's like,

1898
01:16:28,921 --> 01:16:30,790
not only is the science behind this 
crazy,

1899
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,700
but when you have gender reassignment 
surgery,

1900
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:38,050
one of the big issues with men 
transitioning to women as bone density.

1901
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:43,300
She's like,
when you have gender reassignment 

1902
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:43,300
surgery,
you're taking estrogen,

1903
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,590
which actually preserves bone density.
She's like,

1904
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,950
not only do they have less bone density,
once they become a woman,

1905
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,810
they might have more.
Well,

1906
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:55,010
because you're preserving it like it's.
You're not going to automatically be 

1907
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,260
just like a woman in a year or so.

1908
01:16:56,510 --> 01:17:01,510
Don't think surgeons.
I know too much about doctoring from 

1909
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:04,621
having spent 1000 years with my wife's 
medical education to believe that 

1910
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:05,620
doctors have the capacity to magically 
change a man into a woman.

1911
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:06,450
No,

1912
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:11,510
maybe it's going to happen one day with 
like crispr or something that when they 

1913
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,370
start using genetic,
literally genetic before birth.

1914
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:16,040
Maybe if you actually read the 
chromoSome this before birth,

1915
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:18,350
but no,
I mean like no once.

1916
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,670
Once your.
Once your genes had been defined.

1917
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:23,860
What's your chromosomes like?
This is fifth grade science people.

1918
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:24,920
it's fifth grade science.

1919
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:29,970
What scares the shit out of me is when 
you hear these stories about people 

1920
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:31,800
deciding that their child who's like 
eight or nine years old,

1921
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:36,830
that beyond belief,
it's scary because you see nine year 

1922
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:36,830
[inaudible],
17 year old doesn't know.

1923
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:38,370
That was the thing about the ruby rose 
girl.

1924
01:17:38,371 --> 01:17:40,810
She was saying that when she was young,
when she was a teenager,

1925
01:17:40,811 --> 01:17:45,811
she wanted to be a man.
She wanted to be transgender and that 

1926
01:17:45,811 --> 01:17:48,901
she had gone through that phase and now 
she's so happy that she didn't do 

1927
01:17:48,901 --> 01:17:48,901
anything.

1928
01:17:48,901 --> 01:17:48,901
Right.
Well they did.

1929
01:17:48,901 --> 01:17:52,350
They say that 80 percent of kids who 
experienced any sort of gender dysphoria

1930
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:57,380
as children grow out of it,
so when you have a society that 

1931
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:58,500
reinforces it and then in Canada they're
now having their passing laws.

1932
01:17:58,501 --> 01:18:03,501
Now that say that if a kid says,
you know you have a girl and the girl 

1933
01:18:03,501 --> 01:18:03,501
says,
I'm a boy and she's three,

1934
01:18:03,501 --> 01:18:06,120
that the government can come into your 
house and take the kid because obviously

1935
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:11,150
if you.
If you don't want to humor the kid and 

1936
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:11,700
get the kid treatment or surgery or 
hormone blockers,

1937
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,710
then you're obviously doing something 
wrong to the kid.

1938
01:18:13,711 --> 01:18:15,720
This is just.
It's insane.

1939
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:17,490
First of all,
if anyone tried to do that with my kid,

1940
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:18,540
I would meet them at the door with a 
gun.

1941
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:19,820
I mean that,
that this is.

1942
01:18:19,821 --> 01:18:22,620
This is the kind of stuff where you're 
talking legit civil war.

1943
01:18:22,621 --> 01:18:27,621
Like when when you say that the 
government can take people's kids from 

1944
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:27,621
them because the government knows better
than you.

1945
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:32,061
How to parent your kids on basic things 
like are you a boy or a girl that's 

1946
01:18:32,061 --> 01:18:36,541
going to get violent pretty quickly?
If you send someone to my door with a 

1947
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:38,811
gun saying,
I'm taking your daughter from you 

1948
01:18:38,811 --> 01:18:40,581
because your daughter says she's a boy 
at school and you and you're not going 

1949
01:18:40,581 --> 01:18:41,670
to take her to a psychiatrist to start 
her transitioning process.

1950
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:48,090
No,
buT how did we get so far down this 

1951
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:48,730
rabbit hole of insanity and the,
this is again,

1952
01:18:48,731 --> 01:18:53,731
this is not taking away the personal 
choice of a 60 year old man like bruce 

1953
01:18:53,731 --> 01:18:55,420
jenner who decides he wants to be a 
woman free country,

1954
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:57,310
go have at it,
have a good time,

1955
01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:02,610
but how did we get so crazy that that 
becomes an option that people aren't 

1956
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,970
paying attention to?
The,

1957
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:09,990
the,
the massive variables that a child 

1958
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:10,760
encounters,
psychological variables,

1959
01:19:10,761 --> 01:19:13,330
stress variables,
what's going on in the home,

1960
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:16,030
what's happening hormonally,
what's happening psychologically,

1961
01:19:16,031 --> 01:19:20,260
what is happening to you and how,
how can you decide like this is it,

1962
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:25,450
you're good.
You're going to allow this kid to make 

1963
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:26,140
a,
like a lockdown decision to begin gender

1964
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:31,350
transition surgery at like nine or 10 
years old hormone blockers in there to 

1965
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:31,350
an eight year old.
Yeah.

1966
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:34,420
And you know,
and then they'll show you like this girl

1967
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:38,050
who's like 13 who used to be a boy and 
you know,

1968
01:19:38,051 --> 01:19:42,770
you see her act and talk and they go,
how could you imagine that?

1969
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,830
This isn't a girl?
Okay.

1970
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:45,790
I,
I don't,

1971
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:46,870
you know,
I don't know.

1972
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:47,500
I don't,
I don't,

1973
01:19:47,501 --> 01:19:49,060
I don't,
I just don't know what happened.

1974
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:54,220
I'm going to go with the fact that 
there's a y chromosome in every cell of 

1975
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:56,711
that person's body,
except ironically for some of his sperm 

1976
01:19:56,711 --> 01:19:56,711
cells to tell me that that's probably a 
boy.

1977
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:57,620
And,
and yes,

1978
01:19:57,621 --> 01:20:02,621
you can block the manifestation of some 
physical characteristics that does not 

1979
01:20:02,621 --> 01:20:06,161
change the chromosomes.
And there are legitimately intersex 

1980
01:20:06,161 --> 01:20:06,161
people,
right?

1981
01:20:06,161 --> 01:20:09,161
I mean,
there are people who legitimately have 

1982
01:20:09,161 --> 01:20:09,161
conditions like kleinfelter syndrome.
They're like,

1983
01:20:09,161 --> 01:20:09,690
these are,
these are actual biological things,

1984
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,640
but if you're telling me any boy can be 
a girl,

1985
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:13,980
no,
no.

1986
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:15,370
The answer is no.
And it's,

1987
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:20,430
that's not biologically correct and 
you're not doing any sort of service to 

1988
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:21,360
a child,
especially evidence list.

1989
01:20:21,361 --> 01:20:22,080
I mean,
you know,

1990
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:27,110
you're doing no service to a child by 
bringing bye by humoring what is 

1991
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:30,310
obviously a mental condition and a 
mental condition.

1992
01:20:30,311 --> 01:20:30,940
By the way,
again,

1993
01:20:30,941 --> 01:20:35,941
linked 40 percent lifetime suicide rate 
is higher than any other population on 

1994
01:20:35,941 --> 01:20:39,871
planet earth by a whopping margin.
I mean telling kids that we are going to

1995
01:20:40,061 --> 01:20:45,061
force you into that.
Like you express when you're five that 

1996
01:20:45,061 --> 01:20:48,031
you think you're the opposite sex and 
now at eight we're going to transition 

1997
01:20:48,031 --> 01:20:50,431
you into this and your suicide rate is 
exactly the same as somebody who didn't 

1998
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:53,041
do that.
Railroad is very similar to someone who 

1999
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:55,171
didn't do that and,
and like this is somehow supposed to 

2000
01:20:55,171 --> 01:20:55,171
benefit the person.
Uh,

2001
01:20:55,171 --> 01:20:57,040
it's just,
it's beyond imagination.

2002
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,170
I think it's cruelty.
What's very strange

2003
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:04,540
for sure.
And as someone who doesn't experience 

2004
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:04,540
gender dysphoria,
I like to,

2005
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:09,290
I mean when,
when someone's got some sort of an 

2006
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:09,290
issue,
whatever it is,

2007
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:11,400
whether you call it an issue or a 
condition or whatever the fuck it is,

2008
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:13,920
and I don't have it.
I try to be as,

2009
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:17,180
as standoffish.
I tried to be as objective.

2010
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:21,450
I tried to be as kind as possible.
This is a weird one though.

2011
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:26,570
This is a weird one because it's,
it's become some sort of a fad and any 

2012
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:28,830
criticism of it whatsoever,
even discussion of it,

2013
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:31,800
you are labeled as a transphobic piece 
of shit.

2014
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:31,950
Yeah.

2015
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:36,980
I think it's only weird honestly because
it's run into the weird sexual politics 

2016
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:38,750
that dominates in the country because if
we're to talk about anorexia,

2017
01:21:38,751 --> 01:21:40,610
which is a form of body dysphoria,
yes,

2018
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:41,820
alright.
Or if we were to talk about,

2019
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,790
I mean there actually is something body 
identity,

2020
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:44,900
integrity disorder,
right?

2021
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:48,050
Where people want to lose an arm and 
we'd be saying,

2022
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,270
well the problem is in your brain,
it's not in your arm,

2023
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,580
like chopping off your arm seems a 
little extreme,

2024
01:21:52,581 --> 01:21:54,110
but if you want to do that,
like go ahead.

2025
01:21:54,111 --> 01:21:56,810
But if you were a kid and it's and year 
wouldn't say,

2026
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:58,550
oh well this kid's gonna suffer with 
this their entire life.

2027
01:21:58,590 --> 01:21:59,900
Let's just chop off their arm.
Now.

2028
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:05,330
Prevent them from developing like this 
is not an end to tell the entire society

2029
01:22:05,331 --> 01:22:07,910
that this is a positive.
Good is is a whole nother thing.

2030
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:10,760
It's one thing to try and treat people 
who have a disorder humanely.

2031
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:16,000
It's another thing to redefine the terms
of the entire civilization as well as 

2032
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,471
biology in order to fit that.
This is valuing the subject of over the 

2033
01:22:20,471 --> 01:22:20,570
objective.
Science is objective.

2034
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:22,880
Your feelings about who you are is 
subjective.

2035
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:28,210
You can have those feelings,
but once you are trying to translate 

2036
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:28,580
those feelings into the objective 
standard,

2037
01:22:28,581 --> 01:22:30,710
we almost told by now you're encroaching
on my territory.

2038
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:32,750
It's not just,
it's not just you doing what you want to

2039
01:22:32,751 --> 01:22:33,180
do anymore,
you're,

2040
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:34,940
you're telling me what I have to do,
and that's a different thing.

2041
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:35,360
Right?

2042
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:35,750
Right.
Now,

2043
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:40,640
when people say that there is this 40 
percent suicide rate amongst transgender

2044
01:22:40,641 --> 01:22:43,160
people,
I'm one of the arguments that I've heard

2045
01:22:43,161 --> 01:22:45,270
is it's because they're not accepted.
I've heard this too.

2046
01:22:45,271 --> 01:22:45,440
It,
yeah.

2047
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:50,470
Yeah.
And that if they were accepted and then 

2048
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:50,660
they felt themselves and they felt loved
for their true self,

2049
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,970
then it would be just like everybody 
else

2050
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:56,240
and I've seen no evidence to suggest 
that if,

2051
01:22:56,250 --> 01:23:01,250
if there's.
If there is a decrease based on 

2052
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:01,250
treatment,
then it's marginal at best.

2053
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:02,380
Dysphoria,
it's.

2054
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,830
Is it uniform like.
I would like to know like is like gender

2055
01:23:05,831 --> 01:23:10,831
dysphoria.
Is it in a similar percentile as a 

2056
01:23:10,831 --> 01:23:15,480
anorexia or what bodybuilders get or 
what strippers get when they get triple 

2057
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:15,580
f tits,

2058
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:21,010
like the anorexic suicide rate.
The dysphoria is a weird thing,

2059
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:21,540
you know,
it's,

2060
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:26,580
it's it is that people.
There's a girl that goes to my yoga 

2061
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,180
class that's anorexic and it's so 
disturbing.

2062
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:31,000
It's so sad.
It's horrifying.

2063
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,140
It's horrifying.
And listen,

2064
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:37,141
I'm not,
I'm not saying that we should mistreat 

2065
01:23:37,141 --> 01:23:37,141
people,
but if again,

2066
01:23:37,141 --> 01:23:40,380
you're talking about an entire society 
being forced to redefine basic 

2067
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:44,160
biological terminology,
then like it be an adult like live,

2068
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:48,580
like live with this.
I'm happy to treat you with a.

2069
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:51,280
Listen what?
I would hire a transgender person,

2070
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:56,550
but I'm not going to see.
I'm not going to change what reality is 

2071
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:57,550
in order to humor you.
Like if you call yourself napoleon,

2072
01:23:57,551 --> 01:23:59,340
I'm not gonna,
call you napoleon napoleon.

2073
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:01,140
Like this is not something I'm up for.
What'd you take

2074
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:03,690
going into consideration though?
I mean when you were looking at this,

2075
01:24:03,691 --> 01:24:05,320
still goes,
what if someone was really good at their

2076
01:24:05,321 --> 01:24:09,460
job and someone else was equally good at
their job but not transgender?

2077
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,340
Would you lean towards the not 
transgender person because you say,

2078
01:24:12,341 --> 01:24:13,480
well,
the transgender person,

2079
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:16,270
they're dealing with a host of 
psychological issues obviously.

2080
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:16,720
Well,
I mean,

2081
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:21,721
I,
I think that you would have to think 

2082
01:24:21,721 --> 01:24:21,721
about,
you know,

2083
01:24:21,721 --> 01:24:24,660
typical aspects of reliability,
just the same way you would with any 

2084
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:24,660
other mental disorder if you knew 
somebody was,

2085
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:29,610
was manic depressive,
which is super common and you have 

2086
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:29,610
somebody who is equally qualified.
He's not manic depRessive,

2087
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:30,990
you might think,
well that might have an effect on,

2088
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,380
on how they do their job.
Yeah.

2089
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,490
so maybe,
I mean,

2090
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,430
I,
you know,

2091
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,340
I've,
I haven't had enough personal experience

2092
01:24:36,341 --> 01:24:41,341
with transgender people to know whether 
it would impact a secretarial job or 

2093
01:24:41,341 --> 01:24:41,410
something.
Probably not.

2094
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:42,910
Yeah,
probably not.

2095
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:46,180
But again,
to pretend that like transgenders in the

2096
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,920
military,
this seems to me like in a decision that

2097
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:50,710
should be made my military people who 
actually have to determine how much does

2098
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:53,950
this impact the job and if you already 
have a group of people with a 40 percent

2099
01:24:53,951 --> 01:24:57,980
suicide rate who have high levels of 
higher levels of instability,

2100
01:24:57,981 --> 01:25:01,450
is a group not individually as a group 
and you're choosing which groups to pick

2101
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:06,451
from to be on the front lines in small 
units living under severe pressure for 

2102
01:25:06,551 --> 01:25:09,130
months at a time.
Like is that something that,

2103
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,030
is that what you're going to go for or 
is that something where you,

2104
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:15,670
you'd have to overcome certain 
presumptions in order to get theRe?

2105
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,030
Yeah,
I tweeted

2106
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,210
something that kristen beck wrote the 
other day.

2107
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:22,970
uh,
but when the military band,

2108
01:25:22,971 --> 01:25:24,760
when trump apparently there was not a 
real.

2109
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,120
I know it's bullshit.
I mean based,

2110
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,250
just to distract from the sessions 
thing.

2111
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,420
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

2112
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:30,950
Yeah.
I get to 10 minutes later he was back to

2113
01:25:30,951 --> 01:25:35,951
20 minute sessions here.
This was the part about that I didn't 

2114
01:25:35,951 --> 01:25:38,411
like.
Like I actually agree that there is a 

2115
01:25:38,411 --> 01:25:40,961
question as to whether the military 
should be recruiting transgender people 

2116
01:25:40,961 --> 01:25:41,680
because I think that the military has 
certainly it.

2117
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:46,690
It creates a bunch of questions,
not just questions about who showers 

2118
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:46,690
with whom,
but also questions like,

2119
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:47,030
okay,
you have a transgender man.

2120
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:52,120
Does he have to fill the female 
standards of fitness or the male 

2121
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:52,120
standards standards of fitness or like 
these are actual questions,

2122
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:54,080
does it?
How does it work with troop cohesion?

2123
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,390
Right.
You have a group of men and I have men.

2124
01:25:56,700 --> 01:26:01,700
He's technically a man,
but he's had you treat as a woman like 

2125
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:01,700
does he have to carry the same amount of
stuff?

2126
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:02,240
Is the guy like how does that work?
Exactly.

2127
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:07,530
It does this the cost of gender 
transition surgery and hormones and 

2128
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:09,170
psychologists like,
does that come into play at all here?

2129
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:12,050
Would you recruit from the anorexic 
community for the military?

2130
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,390
That's it.
These are like real questions,

2131
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:19,690
but that said,
that's why they commissioned a study 

2132
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:19,690
from general mad as hell at department 
of defense.

2133
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:22,180
He was going to look into all of this 
and then give a report in six months and

2134
01:26:22,181 --> 01:26:27,181
trump just sort of tweeted it out there.
I agree that I think that trump's 

2135
01:26:27,181 --> 01:26:27,181
general,
you know,

2136
01:26:27,181 --> 01:26:31,720
his general attitude on it is probably 
correct in terMs of what the military 

2137
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:31,720
is.
They're doing what,

2138
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:35,830
what it's not there to do,
but what I don't agree with is how he 

2139
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:38,591
did it at all because it's disrespectful
to the people in the military who are 

2140
01:26:38,591 --> 01:26:38,591
transgender.

2141
01:26:38,591 --> 01:26:39,020
I mean like I wouldn't want to find out 
in a tweet.

2142
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:42,650
I want a better rationale then to tweets
and then we're back to.

2143
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:43,890
And then we're back to,
you know,

2144
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:45,320
like,
look,

2145
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,150
they're doing more than I am serving in 
the military.

2146
01:26:47,151 --> 01:26:52,151
I didn't serve in the military.
It seems like it would be pretty 

2147
01:26:52,151 --> 01:26:52,151
hypocritical of me to say,
well,

2148
01:26:52,151 --> 01:26:54,800
it's perfectly respectful to say in two 
tweets you're out because that's the way

2149
01:26:54,801 --> 01:26:56,810
it is without any sort of supporting 
argumentation.

2150
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,760
And he didn't actually implement a 
policy.

2151
01:26:58,761 --> 01:27:03,761
He didn't give the policy to the defense
department so they could even implement 

2152
01:27:03,761 --> 01:27:06,401
it.
The pentAgon says they're not 

2153
01:27:06,401 --> 01:27:06,401
implementing it because they don't have 
a policy,

2154
01:27:06,401 --> 01:27:07,490
so as a pr thing,
so this is a weirD pr thing,

2155
01:27:07,491 --> 01:27:11,210
but it really stirred up people in the 
designed to do.

2156
01:27:11,211 --> 01:27:12,200
Right.
I'm sure.

2157
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:17,410
Well,
either that or he just felt like 

2158
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:17,410
tweeting.

2159
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:17,930
I think that's what I.
I think that's what it was.

2160
01:27:17,931 --> 01:27:22,931
I mean he wanted to shift the 
conversation and it was the funniest 

2161
01:27:22,931 --> 01:27:26,291
thing about that is that he did it in 
two tweets in the first half of the 

2162
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:26,291
tweet was in consultation with my 
generals in my military experts.

2163
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:31,360
We have decided that we will no longer 
accept ellipsis 10 minute gap 

2164
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:32,940
transgender people in the military.
So there was a,

2165
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:37,970
there was a,
there was a story at buzzfeed that was 

2166
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:40,541
kind of funny.
They went and interviewed a bunch of 

2167
01:27:40,541 --> 01:27:42,101
people in the pentagon and a bunch of 
the people in the pentagon or like 

2168
01:27:42,101 --> 01:27:45,100
during that 10 minute cap,
I didn't know whether we were going to 

2169
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:45,100
nuclear war,
what right.

2170
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:48,140
Because that first screen we will no 
longer could have been north korea's 

2171
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,010
missile missile test program.
So.

2172
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:51,560
Wow.
Yeah,

2173
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:51,910
they,
it,

2174
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,330
this again is evidence.

2175
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:53,750
Uh,
you know,

2176
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:57,200
I think it's an example of even if I 
think the policy is good,

2177
01:27:57,410 --> 01:28:02,410
good policy done the wrong way is 
actually counterproductive for the 

2178
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:02,410
policies that I want to see.
None,

2179
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:07,480
like I want it laid out by madison.
I want to lay it out by defense 

2180
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,731
department.
I want all the reasons laid out so we 

2181
01:28:09,731 --> 01:28:11,561
can have a good discussion over it.
I don't really want Just like thought 

2182
01:28:11,561 --> 01:28:11,600
vomit on twitter.
That's just not,

2183
01:28:11,601 --> 01:28:12,650
I don't think it's effective.
Well,

2184
01:28:12,651 --> 01:28:17,651
it also seems that this issue is such a 
hot issue and it's also an issue that 

2185
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:22,961
you're not really allowed to have an 
opinion on other than the standard 

2186
01:28:22,961 --> 01:28:25,970
opinion is always trapped in a man's 
body and this is the way it is.

2187
01:28:25,971 --> 01:28:28,210
And by the way,
this heart healthy this day.

2188
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:30,450
Cardia notion that it's like a man then 
the,

2189
01:28:30,490 --> 01:28:32,690
the,
the soul in the machine.

2190
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:37,640
And there was a woman deep down for 40 
years we had three children with a man's

2191
01:28:37,641 --> 01:28:42,641
penis and now is now is escaping.
Whereas like ghostbusters again goes 

2192
01:28:43,410 --> 01:28:46,730
faster.
If you've seen the man in england,

2193
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,440
was it in england,
knows Germany,

2194
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,470
the man identifies as a six year old 
girl.

2195
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:56,500
Yes.
And so they turned them into a six year 

2196
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,121
old girl.
So there's this clip that clip with me 

2197
01:28:58,121 --> 01:29:00,461
that's going around the internet a fair 
bit when I'm talking to a college girl 

2198
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:00,461
about this and she,
she's saying like,

2199
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:00,830
men or men can be women and women can be
men.

2200
01:29:00,831 --> 01:29:01,230
And I said,
well,

2201
01:29:01,231 --> 01:29:02,880
how old are you?
I love that clip.

2202
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:03,770
I mean,
come on,

2203
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:06,830
why aren't your 60 actually six days.
And she,

2204
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:12,110
she's like baffled lIke what?
And then it finally hits her and it's 

2205
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:12,110
like,
well,

2206
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:12,570
you know.
Yeah.

2207
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:17,600
So it's.
I think this is what's kind of 

2208
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,120
frightening about the age we live in is 
that we can't even come up with common 

2209
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:23,391
definitions of basic things.
How are we Supposed to have 

2210
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:25,221
conversations with each other if we 
can't decide what a man is or what a 

2211
01:29:25,221 --> 01:29:25,920
woman is or,
or whether a scientific fact ought to be

2212
01:29:25,921 --> 01:29:30,921
relevant or not.
At least we could decide what was the 

2213
01:29:30,921 --> 01:29:35,211
scientific fact or not before and now 
it's like the subjective has just eaten 

2214
01:29:35,211 --> 01:29:35,580
everything.
If I don't think it's a scientific fact,

2215
01:29:35,581 --> 01:29:36,750
it's no longer a scientific fact

2216
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:40,040
and that's for amateurs of the argument.
It's become About freedom,

2217
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:43,350
the freedom to be your authentic self 
versus biology.

2218
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:44,640
Right,
and again,

2219
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,100
be be be your authentic self.
I don't give a shit.

2220
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,590
They will do whatever you want,
like you know,

2221
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:53,930
more power to you,
but it is no longer about your freedom 

2222
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:56,631
to be your authentic self when you're 
talking about either the legislation 

2223
01:29:56,631 --> 01:29:58,050
that impacts how I run my business or 
how I raised my child or your suggesting

2224
01:29:58,051 --> 01:30:00,300
that it is my duty to humor your 
authentic self.

2225
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:03,000
Like I think there are a lot of people 
who do stupid crap their entire life.

2226
01:30:03,001 --> 01:30:04,710
It's not my job to humor their authentic
self.

2227
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:08,400
I mean I'm,
I'm pro drug legalization but I've never

2228
01:30:08,401 --> 01:30:10,290
done drugs and I think the drugs are 
stupid.

2229
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:15,830
You know,
don't tell me that I have to like cheer 

2230
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:15,830
when somebody smokes a joint,
like do what you want,

2231
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:20,541
but don't tell me that I have to 
redefine what I think is good and bad 

2232
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:20,541
behavior.
LIke that's silly.

2233
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:20,970
Yeah.
It doesn't make any sense.

2234
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:26,120
And the other thing that it became this 
weird political hot point where we're 

2235
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,210
talking about bathrooms.
Yeah.

2236
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:28,680
And then it become like the number one.

2237
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:31,900
It was easy for people to sort of boil 
down the argument into that I think,

2238
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:32,050
right,

2239
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:34,080
of course like this,
what about my children?

2240
01:30:34,081 --> 01:30:39,081
My children would you want a bathroom 
and a man with a dress is going to come 

2241
01:30:39,081 --> 01:30:39,210
in and he's going to claim that he's a 
identifying as a woman.

2242
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,840
And it got to the point where so many 
people were upset about it that people 

2243
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:45,510
were boycotting South Carolina.

2244
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:52,210
This one I thought was amazing was,
was the ncaa saying they were going to 

2245
01:30:52,210 --> 01:30:55,961
remove the final four from North 
Carolina because they passed the 

2246
01:30:55,961 --> 01:30:57,200
bathroom bill in North Carolina and I,
I asked online,

2247
01:30:57,201 --> 01:31:02,201
okay,
so when are you going to abolish the 

2248
01:31:02,201 --> 01:31:02,201
separate male and female divisions?
Of the ncaa,

2249
01:31:02,201 --> 01:31:06,760
like any you've said that we can't have 
separate male and female bathrooms were 

2250
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:09,610
biological males play and biological 
males go to one bathroom and biological 

2251
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:11,360
females go to another.
So why do you have separate divisions?

2252
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:13,310
Why do you have a.
Why do you have an ncaa women's division

2253
01:31:13,311 --> 01:31:15,350
and an ncaa men's division?
Yeah.

2254
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,670
Where does this go?
I mean eventually it boiled down.

2255
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:22,190
I mean eventually it goes to one place 
or another.

2256
01:31:22,191 --> 01:31:24,920
Like either we just say this is a step 
too far.

2257
01:31:24,921 --> 01:31:26,060
It gives me a break,
you know,

2258
01:31:26,061 --> 01:31:31,061
science has no.
Or we say anyone can be anything at 

2259
01:31:31,061 --> 01:31:34,430
anytime.
A man is a woman and a woman as a man 

2260
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:34,430
and you know,
it's in just pick have you.

2261
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,920
We're seeing the videos of people that 
are gender fluid.

2262
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:40,370
I have seen those videos.
Those videos are fascinating.

2263
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:43,790
They wake up one day and there were a 
woman and the next day there are man.

2264
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:49,000
And so there was a guy on npr,
on radio lab on the podcast who 

2265
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:54,610
transitions at times of stress makes 
perfect sense to me in the middle of 

2266
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:55,670
having a conversation.
I just switched.

2267
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:57,830
I'm paul now.
I'm amanda.

2268
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:58,330
When

2269
01:31:58,330 --> 01:32:03,330
he's more stressed,
he switched into a woman because that'd 

2270
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:03,330
be really sexist,
right?

2271
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:06,031
I mean,
I think that like if you're stressed at 

2272
01:32:06,031 --> 01:32:06,031
work and he switched into a woman and 
started crying,

2273
01:32:06,031 --> 01:32:09,570
that seems kind of sexist to me.
That's implying that women are the 

2274
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:09,570
people who cry at work.
So that is sex.

2275
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:10,780
So this raises a bunch of other weird 
questions like,

2276
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:12,190
okay,
if you're like there's,

2277
01:32:12,191 --> 01:32:14,290
there's been this.
again you want to talk about weird.

2278
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:15,000
There's been this,
this,

2279
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:20,070
this weird push in parts of the trans 
community to suggest that a male who 

2280
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:23,230
doesn't want to have sex with a 
biological male who says he's a female,

2281
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:27,010
is a,
is now a sexist against women?

2282
01:32:27,570 --> 01:32:28,600
Is it trans folk?
Right?

2283
01:32:28,601 --> 01:32:31,320
you're a bad person if you're a man who 
doesn't want to have sex with a man,

2284
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:33,820
a biological man,
and it doesn't make you gay to do that.

2285
01:32:33,821 --> 01:32:38,821
Right?
If you have sex with a biological man 

2286
01:32:38,821 --> 01:32:38,821
who says it's a woman that's straight 
sex,

2287
01:32:38,821 --> 01:32:39,640
but if you were to have sex with a 
biological woman who says she's a man,

2288
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:40,210
you're gay.

2289
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:43,460
Yeah,
kind of weird.

2290
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:49,250
Definitely weird,
but I have seen the arguments in the 

2291
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:52,030
blog Posts and the tweets about men who 
discriminate against trans women who do 

2292
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:53,390
not want to date trans women

2293
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:54,490
and people keep saying,
well,

2294
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:55,470
it's.
It's culturally defined.

2295
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:55,990
It's like,
no.

2296
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,960
That's called evolution.
What?

2297
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:00,160
You have a baby together,
correct?

2298
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:02,770
Correct.
It turns out that evolution wants men to

2299
01:33:02,771 --> 01:33:04,180
have sex with women.
Like,

2300
01:33:04,181 --> 01:33:09,181
I'm sorry to break it to everybody,
but evolution really relies on human 

2301
01:33:09,181 --> 01:33:10,060
reproduction.
Okay.

2302
01:33:10,061 --> 01:33:11,260
If you put that thing in the wrong 
place,

2303
01:33:11,261 --> 01:33:13,950
it ain't going to reproduce.
Like that's just salary.

2304
01:33:13,951 --> 01:33:18,951
I mean I don't.
I don't know why I have to keep 

2305
01:33:18,951 --> 01:33:20,731
apologizing for science and,
and then they say that my party is the 

2306
01:33:20,731 --> 01:33:21,940
party of non science.
Like what?

2307
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:24,490
Like you're the ones who say that two 
minutes before my baby is born,

2308
01:33:24,491 --> 01:33:26,620
it's not a baby and a man can be a 
woman,

2309
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:28,400
but I'm anti science.
I'm just,

2310
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:30,490
I'm am wildly confused by this.
Well,

2311
01:33:30,491 --> 01:33:30,970
the whole thing is

2312
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:32,380
wildly confusing.
Um,

2313
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,000
but it's just such a strange subject.
It's such a strange subject that's been 

2314
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,391
brought to the fore.
I think it's about more of the moral 

2315
01:33:41,391 --> 01:33:41,550
posturing than it is about people who 
actually think this is a major issue.

2316
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:44,490
I think you're absolutely right.
And I think people love to be virtuous.

2317
01:33:44,491 --> 01:33:47,040
They'd love to be on that side.
They live to virtue signal.

2318
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:52,130
How dare you,
how dare you with dick's or lack of fake

2319
01:33:53,491 --> 01:33:55,170
dicks,
but they don't really have a lot of fake

2320
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:56,790
dicks.
they don't really go that far.

2321
01:33:57,210 --> 01:33:59,760
They just sort of take testosterone and 
see what's up.

2322
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:02,650
But it's just,
it's a,

2323
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:06,710
it's a weird facet of our society today 
that is unexpected.

2324
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:11,970
I mean you go back 20,
30 years and it was an oddity and you 

2325
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:12,750
know,
even during the renee richards thing,

2326
01:34:12,751 --> 01:34:14,520
it was more of an oddity than anything

2327
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:19,730
I think just sort of accepted that.
This is why I say I think that it's a 

2328
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:22,840
think that a lot of people who are 
virtue signaling are still treating it 

2329
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:22,840
as an oddity.
They just won't admit that.

2330
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,530
I think that they're watching it because
it's a circus to them and I think that's

2331
01:34:24,531 --> 01:34:29,531
actually cruel.
I don't think that you should like put 

2332
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:29,531
people who suffer from mental illness on
the cover of magazines.

2333
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:31,370
I just don't.
I think that that's bad strategy.

2334
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:33,690
What about bodybuilders?
I mean,

2335
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:35,000
I don't know that.
I'll be honest with you.

2336
01:34:35,001 --> 01:34:36,050
I don't know that much about 
bodybuilding.

2337
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:36,560
I mean,
well they don't.

2338
01:34:36,561 --> 01:34:37,460
Do I look like I know that much about

2339
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,380
the argument that I've heard of crossfit
guy.

2340
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:46,950
I'm more of a marathon runner.
What I've heard the argument about 

2341
01:34:47,201 --> 01:34:51,070
bodybuilders that they suffer from it as
well is that in order to get that big,

2342
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:55,120
you almost have to have some sort of a 
body dysmorphia.

2343
01:34:55,390 --> 01:35:00,390
You.
You have to not understand how insanely 

2344
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:00,390
huge

2345
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:02,300
you are and they'll be really into it.
Their argument is they're really into it

2346
01:35:02,350 --> 01:35:04,860
and which makes sense to me,
but I've heard people say that,

2347
01:35:04,861 --> 01:35:09,861
that it's.
It's like almost like a reverse 

2348
01:35:09,861 --> 01:35:11,861
anorexia.
They never feel like they're big enough 

2349
01:35:11,861 --> 01:35:11,861
that people say that before.
Yeah.

2350
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:17,020
Well,
it's weird that the human mind is 

2351
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:17,810
suspect or uh,
subjects were really open to suggestion.

2352
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:22,870
Really open to suggestion,
which is what scares people about 

2353
01:35:22,870 --> 01:35:22,970
children transitioning for sure,
for sure.

2354
01:35:22,971 --> 01:35:23,510
I mean,
listen,

2355
01:35:23,511 --> 01:35:28,511
you,
you see it in everything including 

2356
01:35:28,511 --> 01:35:30,221
fashion.
Like how many dudes wax their chest now 

2357
01:35:30,221 --> 01:35:32,650
30 years ago.
Nobody likes theiR chest or they waxing 

2358
01:35:32,650 --> 01:35:33,290
to waxing jeff chest,
wax their chest whenever,

2359
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:38,291
whatever it is,
questions about the youth are turned to 

2360
01:35:38,291 --> 01:35:38,291
young jamie.
Yeah,

2361
01:35:38,291 --> 01:35:41,130
it did.
But you watch tv now and every dude on 

2362
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:41,680
tv has a chest as bare as my young 14 
month old son.

2363
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:42,920
So I hear you.
And it's like,

2364
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,000
where'd this come from?
and this came from grades.

2365
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:48,290
We'll look chiseled.
And it also came from tv and tv.

2366
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:49,850
It was going to be men are going to be 
hairless.

2367
01:35:49,851 --> 01:35:54,851
Now this is,
this is the new trend of men are going 

2368
01:35:54,851 --> 01:35:56,471
to be hairless and you don't,
you don't get the burt reynolds like 

2369
01:35:56,471 --> 01:35:58,910
bare chest anymore.
And so if people are susceptible to even

2370
01:35:58,911 --> 01:36:02,000
that with regard to fashion like people 
have for for five years,

2371
01:36:02,001 --> 01:36:07,001
people convince themselves that skinny 
jeans or thing like people are open to 

2372
01:36:07,001 --> 01:36:10,360
to virtually any sort of suggestion,
bell bottoms that come in and come out 

2373
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:10,360
member when they try to bring bell 
bottoms back.

2374
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:13,970
I did or did not a good call.
They tried and people are like,

2375
01:36:13,971 --> 01:36:15,140
nah,
not this one.

2376
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:20,170
Platforms when they used to be our 
platform shoes that that's why I'm just 

2377
01:36:20,170 --> 01:36:21,080
keeping around all my dad's old clothes 
because eventually they're going to come

2378
01:36:21,081 --> 01:36:21,620
back in again.

2379
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:23,090
You never know.
Yeah.

2380
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:28,280
The,
the idea of fashion and culture also 

2381
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:32,711
being like the saMe sort of mechanism 
that allows people to be variable when 

2382
01:36:32,711 --> 01:36:34,680
it comes to their gender.
That's.

2383
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:36,350
I mean you actually see that there's a 
study.

2384
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:39,080
I thought this is fascinating.
There was a study in britain or Poland,

2385
01:36:39,081 --> 01:36:44,081
britain about sexual orientation and 
what I found was 95 percent of people 

2386
01:36:44,081 --> 01:36:48,401
over the age of 60 identified as 
exclusively heterosexual of people who 

2387
01:36:48,401 --> 01:36:52,001
are under the age of 30,
only 42 percent identified as 

2388
01:36:52,001 --> 01:36:52,001
exclusively heterosexual.
It was like,

2389
01:36:52,001 --> 01:36:56,561
okay,
well in two generations it's not that 

2390
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:56,561
half the population became bisexual,
right.

2391
01:36:56,561 --> 01:37:01,331
That is not a scientific thing.
That means that people are open to 

2392
01:37:01,331 --> 01:37:01,331
suggestion about their sexual behavior,
which you would assume.

2393
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:02,500
Right.
So,

2394
01:37:02,501 --> 01:37:07,501
so assuming the culture has no impact,
and this goes against the whole of born 

2395
01:37:07,501 --> 01:37:11,141
this way aspect of the homosexual rights
movement and the gay rights movement 

2396
01:37:11,141 --> 01:37:11,141
that says,
oh,

2397
01:37:11,141 --> 01:37:11,240
you were born this way.

2398
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:15,470
Like I agree that there's a genetic 
component to sexual behavior,

2399
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:20,830
but the idea that that's what,
why 50 percent of the uk population has 

2400
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:21,680
shifted toward,
you know,

2401
01:37:21,681 --> 01:37:25,130
I'm open to anything.
culture has something to present at,

2402
01:37:25,190 --> 01:37:30,190
as I say 95 percent people over the age 
of 60 and then 42 percent of people 

2403
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:31,620
under the age of 30.
So that's it.

2404
01:37:31,621 --> 01:37:34,370
So that's 42 percent.
Say that exclusively.

2405
01:37:34,371 --> 01:37:35,180
No,
no.

2406
01:37:35,181 --> 01:37:36,650
Forty two percent of people say they're 
extremely,

2407
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,120
extremely,
extremely,

2408
01:37:38,121 --> 01:37:40,260
a heterosexual,
extremely high forties,

2409
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:42,470
exclusively heterosexual.
So 60 percent,

2410
01:37:42,471 --> 01:37:47,471
nearly 60 percent,
78 percent say that they are on the 

2411
01:37:47,471 --> 01:37:47,471
spectrum,
but not exclusively heterosexual.

2412
01:37:47,471 --> 01:37:51,911
That's fascinating.
I wonder if they only talk to women who 

2413
01:37:51,911 --> 01:37:54,221
are drunk,
like young drunk girls.

2414
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:59,370
They get crazy,
but I think also for perella thing,

2415
01:37:59,371 --> 01:38:01,230
right?
Where adam adam has a whole shtick about

2416
01:38:01,231 --> 01:38:06,231
like in the future there's going to be a
point where guys are considered gay if 

2417
01:38:06,231 --> 01:38:06,480
they won't kiss another dude.

2418
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:07,470
Like,
what are you gay,

2419
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:10,050
you afraid that your gay kiss another 
didn't show me you're not gay.

2420
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:11,880
It's,
we've gone.

2421
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:14,010
We've gone around the bend a little bit.
We have.

2422
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:20,030
There's also this thing that I think 
happens when you have to very clear 

2423
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:20,900
sides,
you know,

2424
01:38:20,910 --> 01:38:25,910
were you have teams and you sort of a 
line in the sand not supposed to cross 

2425
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:29,691
and there's the right side and there's 
the left side and we have that in this 

2426
01:38:29,691 --> 01:38:32,451
country.
We really don't have a third party 

2427
01:38:32,451 --> 01:38:32,451
option.
No third parties are kind of a joke.

2428
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:36,090
And whenever you have two opposing 
viewpoints,

2429
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,060
people dig in.
Have you,

2430
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,710
have you seen this new documentary 
about,

2431
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:42,240
um,
William F.

2432
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:43,110
Buckley,
gore vidal.

2433
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:45,750
And the debate is any good.
It's great.

2434
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:50,250
It's really interesting debates they had
during the 1968 election.

2435
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:52,530
It's fascinating to watch some of those 
debates,

2436
01:38:52,531 --> 01:38:54,090
but yeah,
it's intense.

2437
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:59,440
Yeah.
Particularly the little buckley 

2438
01:38:59,440 --> 01:38:59,440
threatens to punch,
fit all queer and says,

2439
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:02,470
I'll sock you in the face and you'll 
stay plastic flask.

2440
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:05,910
It's weird because it's a pastor.
It's spectacular.

2441
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:08,120
And it's such a like,
it's so in the,

2442
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:10,380
the speak of the day,
you know,

2443
01:39:10,381 --> 01:39:11,550
like 19,
68,

2444
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:12,660
the brahmin accent.
It's,

2445
01:39:12,661 --> 01:39:13,440
it's,
it's great.

2446
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:14,940
Like it's almost british accent.
Yeah,

2447
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,040
it's fantastic.
It's really interesting.

2448
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:20,010
And then.
But these,

2449
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:22,170
I mean,
it's that thing,

2450
01:39:22,171 --> 01:39:27,171
this my team versus that team and uh,
I think the left is guilty of it as much

2451
01:39:28,321 --> 01:39:30,460
as the writers guilty of it.
It seems like it's,

2452
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:35,370
it's a real issue where there's a lot of
people that have ideas and opinions.

2453
01:39:35,371 --> 01:39:38,100
It's sort of cross party lines,
but uh,

2454
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:40,920
they vote on one side or another and 
they vote for their team.

2455
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,690
And I think that's right.
And I think that,

2456
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:45,210
especially in this last election,
I think that was true.

2457
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:47,820
I think that people felt so alienated by
the other side,

2458
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:49,770
like to understand a lot of people who 
voted trump.

2459
01:39:49,771 --> 01:39:54,771
You have to understand that there are a 
lot of people in the country who felt 

2460
01:39:54,771 --> 01:39:57,741
insulted by the left.
They were just sick of being called a 

2461
01:39:57,741 --> 01:39:57,741
racist,
sexist,

2462
01:39:57,741 --> 01:40:00,650
homophobes.
Every time someone wanting to advance a 

2463
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:00,650
policy on the left,
and so they said,

2464
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:01,170
okay,
screw that,

2465
01:40:01,171 --> 01:40:03,660
or at least trump's not calling me that,
so I'll do that,

2466
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:09,020
and then there are a bunch of people on 
the left who now feel insulted by 

2467
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:10,110
trump's even presence and they think all
the people who voted for trump are those

2468
01:40:10,111 --> 01:40:12,210
people until they're fighting racism,
sexism,

2469
01:40:12,211 --> 01:40:14,010
bigotry,
and homophobia by voting against trump.

2470
01:40:14,011 --> 01:40:19,011
Again,
I would go back to this at the end 

2471
01:40:19,011 --> 01:40:19,011
there,
there's a hardening of of it.

2472
01:40:19,011 --> 01:40:19,380
There's not one bubble in the country.
There's still,

2473
01:40:19,381 --> 01:40:24,381
you know,
the right likes to accuse the left of 

2474
01:40:24,381 --> 01:40:24,381
being in a bubble in the coast.

2475
01:40:24,381 --> 01:40:28,240
There's a bubble on the right to which 
is the idea that everybody on every 

2476
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:28,340
piece of the media is lying to you.
Right?

2477
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,150
Is fake news.
Everything's fake news.

2478
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:35,690
Fake news.
These bubbles are not healthy for the 

2479
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:35,690
republic.
I mean,

2480
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:38,651
what?
We can't have conversations with each 

2481
01:40:38,651 --> 01:40:38,651
other.
If we,

2482
01:40:38,651 --> 01:40:40,701
if we do this 10,
no deception is not healthy across the 

2483
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:42,240
board and there's another thing that's 
going on where everybody's a nazi,

2484
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:47,930
like I've never heard people called a 
nazi more than i have over the last six 

2485
01:40:47,930 --> 01:40:48,720
months.
I mean,

2486
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:50,760
it's been crazy.
If you support trump,

2487
01:40:50,761 --> 01:40:54,070
you're a nazi,
you're a neo nazi or you're somehow

2488
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,270
or another,
you're a fascist.

2489
01:40:55,271 --> 01:40:57,280
If you didn't vote for hillary,
you're a nazi.

2490
01:40:57,281 --> 01:41:01,630
Like some people have boiled it down to 
like the purest form.

2491
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:03,030
Yeah,
I,

2492
01:41:03,031 --> 01:41:04,000
I agree.
I mean,

2493
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:09,090
first of all,
it demonstrates tremendous historical 

2494
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:09,090
ignorance.
Forget the holocaust.

2495
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:09,670
Like you just look at what,
who hitler was in the policies.

2496
01:41:09,671 --> 01:41:11,230
He promulgated,
like he was basically.

2497
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,260
He was all over the place when he wanted
to talk to socialist.

2498
01:41:14,261 --> 01:41:19,261
He was a socialist.
What do you wanted to talk to 

2499
01:41:19,261 --> 01:41:19,261
capitalist?
He was a capitalist.

2500
01:41:19,261 --> 01:41:21,841
He was.
He was a top down government guy for 

2501
01:41:21,841 --> 01:41:21,841
sure,
but he would speak the language of,

2502
01:41:21,841 --> 01:41:21,880
of,
you know,

2503
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,960
what would be considered the european 
far right today on a lot of,

2504
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:31,020
on a lot of issues.
But then he would talk about 

2505
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:33,031
redistribution of resources and 
universal healthcare and all this kind 

2506
01:41:33,031 --> 01:41:33,031
of stuff,
and I'm moving guns,

2507
01:41:33,031 --> 01:41:37,740
but he's just a convenient club.
I mean that's just a convenient club 

2508
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:37,960
because then and then did this part that
scares me.

2509
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:43,050
Once you say that somebody is hitler,
then it actually becomes obligatory to 

2510
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:44,110
physically resist them.
Then we can say,

2511
01:41:44,111 --> 01:41:47,010
you can't have a conversation with 
hitler once you say somebody,

2512
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,700
hitler the kkk,
what are you?

2513
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,680
What are you going to do?
Let's have a conversation with them.

2514
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:55,800
At the very least you won't talk with 
them and at the most you might try to 

2515
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:55,800
punch them.

2516
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:58,150
That is really a problem with that.
Those the nomenclature,

2517
01:41:58,151 --> 01:42:00,820
right?
That's really a problem with identifying

2518
01:42:00,821 --> 01:42:05,170
someone in that way that they.
They are someone that you have to resist

2519
01:42:05,171 --> 01:42:07,630
and they are someone who cannot be 
reasoned with.

2520
01:42:07,631 --> 01:42:12,631
The are someone who is absolutely evil.
There's no like variables are variants 

2521
01:42:12,631 --> 01:42:13,090
in their behavior.

2522
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:13,800
And,
and listen,

2523
01:42:13,801 --> 01:42:15,990
I like fiery political rhetoric.
I find it fun,

2524
01:42:15,991 --> 01:42:18,230
but I think once you label somebody,
you know,

2525
01:42:18,450 --> 01:42:23,450
completely evil,
you have a responsibility not to debate 

2526
01:42:23,450 --> 01:42:28,251
with them.
First one is really not to talk with 

2527
01:42:28,251 --> 01:42:28,251
them.
Even the conversation legitimize islam.

2528
01:42:28,251 --> 01:42:29,340
Yeah.
I mean that like I'm listening.

2529
01:42:29,341 --> 01:42:34,341
I'm sure you're gonna get a bunch of 
shit from people for even having me on 

2530
01:42:34,341 --> 01:42:34,341
because the idea is going to be,
well,

2531
01:42:34,341 --> 01:42:38,510
how could you have on somebody like 
superior legitimizing his point of view 

2532
01:42:38,510 --> 01:42:39,180
by having them on.
I know a lot of people who I politically

2533
01:42:39,181 --> 01:42:40,560
disagree with who've had that 
experience,

2534
01:42:40,561 --> 01:42:42,000
what will have me on their show and it's
like,

2535
01:42:42,030 --> 01:42:45,960
how dare you have shapiro on because 
you're just granting him cover,

2536
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:46,560
you know,
like,

2537
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:49,140
or we can just have a conversation and 
maybe we'll disagree.

2538
01:42:49,141 --> 01:42:49,800
Maybe we'll agree.

2539
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:54,920
Yeah.
I really don't give a fuck about those 

2540
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:54,920
people.
I think that's a silly conversation.

2541
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:58,080
I feel like you should talk to everybody
and if you disagree or agree.

2542
01:42:58,081 --> 01:43:01,320
I have friends on that I owe my friend 
yesterday I had on eddie bravo.

2543
01:43:01,321 --> 01:43:03,240
He believes in everything is a fucking 
conspiracy.

2544
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:05,940
I disagree with him wildly and I love 
him like a brother.

2545
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:11,420
I don't think you have to agree with 
people and I don't think you have to at 

2546
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:15,380
the idea that you can't just have a 
conversation with someone about 

2547
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:18,231
something and see if you can find middle
ground or see if you could clearly 

2548
01:43:18,231 --> 01:43:21,351
define their point of view or find their
perspective that's missing today in a 

2549
01:43:21,351 --> 01:43:23,400
weird way,
and one of the weirdest things about the

2550
01:43:23,401 --> 01:43:28,401
election was the ping pong match between
the left and the right as played out on 

2551
01:43:28,401 --> 01:43:30,570
national television by the media.
I would watch,

2552
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:35,720
especially cable news.
I would watch fox news and then go to 

2553
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:38,721
cnn and go back and forth flip channels.
You know you have that previous channel 

2554
01:43:38,721 --> 01:43:40,230
button down the direct tv.
I would just put it on both of them go,

2555
01:43:40,231 --> 01:43:41,010
what,
what?

2556
01:43:41,011 --> 01:43:42,630
What's really happening?
It's beautiful.

2557
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:42,630
The

2558
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:44,790
worlds.
My mom said this in 2012 with romney and

2559
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:47,040
obama.
If you read the right wing media,

2560
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:52,130
there was no way romney was going to 
lose and if you read the left wing 

2561
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:52,130
media,
there was no way romney was going to win

2562
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:53,150
and she said,
which one of these do I believe in it,

2563
01:43:53,151 --> 01:43:58,151
so it's probably somewhere in the middle
like I have a basic rule which is that 

2564
01:43:58,151 --> 01:43:59,080
if you have a New York times report and 
then you have a report from my site that

2565
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:04,090
daily wire and they share the facts,
you can probably assume the facts are 

2566
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:06,821
true,
but the opinions that are embedded with 

2567
01:44:06,821 --> 01:44:09,701
the facts,
those are opinions and that's what's so 

2568
01:44:09,701 --> 01:44:12,371
hard about.
I think the modern mediA landscape is 

2569
01:44:12,371 --> 01:44:14,501
trying to separate the facts from the 
opinion and so this is why when trump 

2570
01:44:14,501 --> 01:44:17,150
says fake news,
he's not wrong that cnn hates him in the

2571
01:44:17,151 --> 01:44:18,980
New York times hates him.
He's right about that,

2572
01:44:18,981 --> 01:44:23,981
but just labeling it all fake news is 
inaccurate also because most of what 

2573
01:44:23,981 --> 01:44:24,440
they're reporting is true,
right?

2574
01:44:24,441 --> 01:44:28,210
It's just that it's biased against women
can be both true and biased and I'm true

2575
01:44:28,211 --> 01:44:28,880
and biased.
Right?

2576
01:44:28,881 --> 01:44:32,240
I say things that I think are factual,
but I'm obviously conservative.

2577
01:44:32,241 --> 01:44:33,290
That's my point of view,
you know,

2578
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:34,530
tough shit.
So that's.

2579
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:35,300
And you're

2580
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:36,680
commentator,
right?

2581
01:44:36,681 --> 01:44:37,670
That's what you do.
I mean,

2582
01:44:37,671 --> 01:44:39,290
half of it is,
you know,

2583
01:44:39,291 --> 01:44:41,900
riling people up saying provocative 
things.

2584
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:42,390
I mean that's.

2585
01:44:42,870 --> 01:44:47,870
This is,
and this is where I think the right is 

2586
01:44:47,870 --> 01:44:47,870
correct about cnn and the New York times
and some of the other networks,

2587
01:44:47,870 --> 01:44:48,240
like though,
if you ask the right,

2588
01:44:48,241 --> 01:44:52,410
what pisses you off more cnn or msnbc,
most people in the right will say cnn,

2589
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:57,680
not msnbc because msnbc is honest enough
to say we're on the left and cnn 

2590
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,420
pretends we have no bias.
We're above all that same thing with the

2591
01:45:00,421 --> 01:45:05,421
New York times,
know we're above all that and then they 

2592
01:45:05,421 --> 01:45:05,421
run the most egregiously bias headlines.
So we'd go,

2593
01:45:05,421 --> 01:45:07,440
well that if they're lying about that,
they're lying about everything.

2594
01:45:07,890 --> 01:45:08,950
You know,
one of my fast,

2595
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:12,790
my most fascinating characters of this 
whole play with Scott Adams,

2596
01:45:13,270 --> 01:45:16,690
and particularly because Scott Adams,
and when I had him on my podcast,

2597
01:45:16,691 --> 01:45:18,590
he was saying he doesn't even vote.
Yeah.

2598
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:21,350
just like what I am.
What I am paying attention to,

2599
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:26,380
he goes,
I'm a trained hypnotist and I'm paying 

2600
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:28,150
attention to the powers of persuasion 
and I'm looking at trends and I'm making

2601
01:45:28,151 --> 01:45:30,160
some predictions that turned out to be 
accurate.

2602
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:32,050
And he's like,
he's looking at trump,

2603
01:45:32,051 --> 01:45:34,780
but he's not talking about trump and in 
these glowing terms,

2604
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:40,050
he's talking about him as being an 
effective persuader and he lost millions

2605
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:46,560
of dollars because of that opinion.
Talking about a guy that he's not even 

2606
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:46,560
going to vote for.
I mean,

2607
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:49,750
this is all leading up to the election 
where people were fucking furious at him

2608
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:55,050
and even more furious at him after trump
won because he would do those coffee 

2609
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:59,491
with scott.
Things we does on periscope where he 

2610
01:45:59,491 --> 01:46:02,101
wakes up and he's just starts answering,
asking questions and he's so measured 

2611
01:46:02,101 --> 01:46:06,751
and calm.
And he had a podcast recently with sam 

2612
01:46:06,751 --> 01:46:10,651
harris where I think it was just like a 
little too far over the edge of 

2613
01:46:10,651 --> 01:46:11,370
apologizing for some,
some,

2614
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:14,260
uh,
trump's behavior and sort of attributing

2615
01:46:14,261 --> 01:46:18,780
some of trump's behavior too,
that you could say was in competence and

2616
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:19,670
attributed to the,
like some,

2617
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,000
some,
some sort of a master.

2618
01:46:21,001 --> 01:46:21,040
yeah.

2619
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:25,000
Smelly quarrel with scott I think is 
that he tends to believe that everything

2620
01:46:25,001 --> 01:46:27,790
trump does is 987 degree underwater,
upside down,

2621
01:46:27,791 --> 01:46:28,660
hungry,
hungry hippos.

2622
01:46:28,810 --> 01:46:33,810
Like everything is.
It's all just absolute genius and it's 

2623
01:46:33,810 --> 01:46:36,040
three steps down the road instead of 
like stumbling his way to victory.

2624
01:46:36,870 --> 01:46:41,870
Okay.
I knew everyone involved in the 

2625
01:46:41,870 --> 01:46:41,870
campaign,
like every single person who is involved

2626
01:46:41,870 --> 01:46:46,261
in the campaign.
I knew this was a stumble their way to 

2627
01:46:46,261 --> 01:46:46,261
victory.
It is amazing the minds,

2628
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:51,330
human beings are.
We need to think it's sort of the joker 

2629
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:51,480
says in the dark knight,
we need to think there's a plan.

2630
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:54,120
We always need to think there's a plan.
And so if trump won,

2631
01:46:54,121 --> 01:46:57,600
it must be because there was some master
plan that he unveiled over the course of

2632
01:46:57,601 --> 01:47:00,360
the campaign three weeks before the 
election.

2633
01:47:00,361 --> 01:47:03,160
He was caught on tape saying that he 
wanted to grab women by the p word.

2634
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:05,370
No,
there was no master plan.

2635
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:10,620
Right?
It's just that hillary was an awful 

2636
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:10,620
candidate and no one liked her.
Okay.

2637
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:11,000
The,
the,

2638
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:16,060
the idea that the trump was like,
even the idea that there was a broad 

2639
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:17,130
national movement for trump that wasn't 
there for other candidates.

2640
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,950
He won fewer votes in Wisconsin than 
mitt romney did.

2641
01:47:19,951 --> 01:47:23,070
And he won the state.
And that's because no one liked hillary.

2642
01:47:23,071 --> 01:47:28,071
I mean,
this is the untold story of the 

2643
01:47:28,071 --> 01:47:29,181
elections.
This was not a referendum on Donald 

2644
01:47:29,181 --> 01:47:29,181
Trump.
This is a referendum on hillary clinton,

2645
01:47:29,181 --> 01:47:30,150
particularly in the heartland.
And people hated her guts,

2646
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:32,250
right?
barack obama won Ohio walking away.

2647
01:47:32,251 --> 01:47:35,370
everyone talks about Michigan and 
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

2648
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:38,580
Nobody talks about Ohio.
Trump won Ohio walking away.

2649
01:47:38,581 --> 01:47:41,850
One of the reasons he won Ohio walking 
away is because in 2012,

2650
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,860
barack obama really drove out the black 
vote.

2651
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:46,560
The percentage of the black vote,
typically in Ohio,

2652
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:50,610
it's like 10 percent of the general vote
in 2012 was like 13 to 15 percent of the

2653
01:47:50,611 --> 01:47:53,730
general board and that was the entire 
margin of victory for obama in the state

2654
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:58,760
of Ohio.
Hillary got closer to sort of the 

2655
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:00,780
traditional percentages and she lost in 
a whopping blowout in Ohio.

2656
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:06,140
No one likes hillary clinton and the 
left was so arrogant that they thought 

2657
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:06,420
we can take the most unpopular,
unlikable,

2658
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,880
unqualified,
nasty,

2659
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:13,440
boring human being anyone has seen for 
20 years and we'll run her.

2660
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:18,770
She's the one will run.
But do you understand that the company 

2661
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:21,021
would have to look helen competence.
You have to be to lose to a celebrity 

2662
01:48:21,021 --> 01:48:21,021
game show host.

2663
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:24,290
Like you hAve to suck at this in a royal
manor.

2664
01:48:24,430 --> 01:48:25,250
Where at one,
I don't know.

2665
01:48:25,251 --> 01:48:26,170
Now,
now that thIng,

2666
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:29,600
the floodgates are open,
but don't you think senator rock man,

2667
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:33,370
apparently he's like way ahead.
Well the,

2668
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:35,210
so the.
So he's going to win the primary.

2669
01:48:35,390 --> 01:48:40,390
If he didn't win the primary,
then he would have to run as an 

2670
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:40,390
independent.
Then he'd be indie rock.

2671
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:43,610
Right.
Right kid rock is gonna win the primary.

2672
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:46,160
Oh,
well we can only have one,

2673
01:48:46,161 --> 01:48:47,060
two.
Once he's in the office,

2674
01:48:47,061 --> 01:48:48,410
he grows into it and it becomes adult 
rock.

2675
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:51,140
How's ted nugent not run for office yet?
That's what I want to know.

2676
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:56,270
How does he not know jim rock given a 
conversation about running for 

2677
01:48:56,270 --> 01:48:56,740
president,
you know,

2678
01:48:56,741 --> 01:48:57,250
and that,
you know,

2679
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,090
if the people really wanted it,
he would do it.

2680
01:48:59,091 --> 01:49:00,950
And I was like,
oh jesus,

2681
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,270
I just can't wait for the rock.

2682
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:06,780
Oprah,
you know the rock my.

2683
01:49:06,781 --> 01:49:10,610
When the rock might win.
If oprah ran in 20,

2684
01:49:10,611 --> 01:49:11,320
20.
Yeah.

2685
01:49:11,630 --> 01:49:14,680
Is she the rock with oprah?
It's a fucking dual take.

2686
01:49:14,681 --> 01:49:17,540
Slam dunk man.
The rock and oprah together.

2687
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:22,660
So I have this weird idea that we should
actually reinstitute a monarchy and it 

2688
01:49:22,660 --> 01:49:22,850
shouldn't just be ceremonial and they 
can be a celebrity,

2689
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:27,910
right?
I'll just make a celebrity monarch and 

2690
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:27,910
that person will just be there to look 
pretty and queen of england,

2691
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:29,570
but don't really have anything.
No power,

2692
01:49:29,870 --> 01:49:33,620
no power because we keep conflating the 
presidency with like who actually has to

2693
01:49:33,621 --> 01:49:38,621
do things right?
But like people who would want to 

2694
01:49:38,621 --> 01:49:38,621
represent the country.
Yeah.

2695
01:49:38,621 --> 01:49:39,440
We have a popularity contest.
So who gets to control the nukes?

2696
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,600
Which is insane.
That's pretty wild.

2697
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:42,500
That's pretty wild.

2698
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:43,860
And I think that,
you know,

2699
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:49,040
this is,
we all think in cinematic terms now and 

2700
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:52,530
you know,
hollywood is run by the dopiest jackass 

2701
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:52,720
is like,
I grew up with all these people.

2702
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:55,810
These are not people who you want 
controlling the narrative.

2703
01:49:55,811 --> 01:49:56,560
And then we're like,
you know what?

2704
01:49:56,561 --> 01:49:58,940
Let's take.
If tom hanks would only run if tommy,

2705
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:01,520
what makes you think tom hanks would be 
a good president?

2706
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:04,190
Like did you look at trump and when god 
he's doing such a brilliant job,

2707
01:50:04,191 --> 01:50:07,880
but we really need now is the guy from 
castaway and we need as an actor again,

2708
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:10,760
we did well with reagan.
We need another act.

2709
01:50:10,761 --> 01:50:13,750
We did great with swarts and anger is 
the governor late.

2710
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:18,820
At least.
Reagan was governor for 20 years before 

2711
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:20,921
he,
before he was the president of the 

2712
01:50:20,921 --> 01:50:20,921
United States.
I mean,

2713
01:50:20,921 --> 01:50:20,921
let's,
let's,

2714
01:50:20,921 --> 01:50:20,921
let's put them,
let's put them through the ringer.

2715
01:50:20,921 --> 01:50:21,410
I mean,
shorts and I got approved in eight years

2716
01:50:21,411 --> 01:50:24,260
that he was not capable of doing 
anything except kind of sucking will you

2717
01:50:24,261 --> 01:50:25,830
ever heard him talk about it?
The way it.

2718
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:27,380
From his perspective,
he's lIke,

2719
01:50:27,410 --> 01:50:32,410
you don't really understand how much red
tape and bullshit you have to go 

2720
01:50:32,410 --> 01:50:32,410
through.
He goes,

2721
01:50:32,410 --> 01:50:34,070
I would meet with people and they would 
agree with me that it's a good idea.

2722
01:50:34,071 --> 01:50:36,530
However,
they would say my voters are never going

2723
01:50:36,531 --> 01:50:38,180
to agree with it,
so I'm going to oppose it.

2724
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:43,360
So even though I know you're right,
there's a bunch of farmers that are 

2725
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,090
going to be mad at me for doing that,
so I'm not going to do that.

2726
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,380
Well,
this is the other thing in politics that

2727
01:50:45,381 --> 01:50:50,381
really drives me nuts.
So there are two promises that 

2728
01:50:50,381 --> 01:50:50,381
politicians make that are complete 
bullshit.

2729
01:50:50,381 --> 01:50:53,670
The first promise they make is I'm going
to go to Washington dc and I'm going to 

2730
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:53,670
get things done.
No,

2731
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:54,130
you're not.
Okay.

2732
01:50:54,150 --> 01:50:56,170
The system,
the system is built for gridlock.

2733
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:01,200
It's built for gridlock.
It's why we have two separate houses of 

2734
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:03,121
congress.
It's why you have a president who can 

2735
01:51:03,121 --> 01:51:03,450
veto is why we have a supreme court that
rules on cases is built for griddle.

2736
01:51:03,451 --> 01:51:05,950
It's wHy we have states that are 
supposed to be able to check the federal

2737
01:51:05,951 --> 01:51:07,330
government.
All of a sudden the federalist papers,

2738
01:51:07,331 --> 01:51:08,290
it was built for gridlock

2739
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:13,290
and some people are happy with that 
because that's how trump is being like 

2740
01:51:13,290 --> 01:51:14,370
sideline that every time he tries to 
make something really important,

2741
01:51:14,371 --> 01:51:14,510
I think

2742
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:19,700
they all should be happy with that 
because the only way things were 

2743
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:19,700
supposed to get pastors with wide public
support,

2744
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:20,640
right,
which she's probably a good thing.

2745
01:51:20,641 --> 01:51:25,641
We don't want the government shifting 
wildly and veering on its access every 

2746
01:51:25,641 --> 01:51:26,760
four years or every two years.
I liked the gridlock.

2747
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:30,390
My big problem is that the gridlock now 
protects a huge system that I don't like

2748
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:33,450
that's been built up over 100 years and 
in the case of growth of government,

2749
01:51:33,451 --> 01:51:38,451
but I liked the gridlock,
but that's one promise that's made and 

2750
01:51:38,451 --> 01:51:38,451
then people are disappointed,
oh,

2751
01:51:38,451 --> 01:51:39,300
if we get in there,
we're going to repeal obamacare.

2752
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:39,750
It's like,
no,

2753
01:51:39,751 --> 01:51:40,920
you're not.
You're not.

2754
01:51:40,921 --> 01:51:45,921
I mean like you can promise it,
but now you're not going to do it 

2755
01:51:45,921 --> 01:51:47,070
because you're full of crap wHen you 
said it and now you're not gonna do it,

2756
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:50,430
and the gridlock is there and it's hard 
to change things.

2757
01:51:51,110 --> 01:51:56,110
It takes a tremendous effort of will and
electoral power to actually change 

2758
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:56,550
things in a big way.
So this idea will elect trump and trump,

2759
01:51:56,670 --> 01:51:58,590
like trump would say,
it's all going to be so easy.

2760
01:51:58,680 --> 01:51:59,760
It's like,
no,

2761
01:51:59,761 --> 01:52:00,390
it's not.
It's.

2762
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:05,430
It wasn't easy for obama.
Obama passed obamacare and that was it 

2763
01:52:05,430 --> 01:52:06,330
for his presidency can do anything for 
the next six years.

2764
01:52:06,990 --> 01:52:08,610
There were no major pieces of 
legislation.

2765
01:52:08,611 --> 01:52:11,280
Nothing happened after that.
He lost congress and that was it.

2766
01:52:11,670 --> 01:52:12,640
Okay,
so that's a promise.

2767
01:52:12,641 --> 01:52:17,641
Number one,
the other promise is your anger is 

2768
01:52:17,641 --> 01:52:17,641
justified,
and this is the one I hate even more,

2769
01:52:17,641 --> 01:52:19,920
and that is the idea that you know in,
in regular life,

2770
01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:21,360
when you have kids,
I have kids.

2771
01:52:21,361 --> 01:52:26,361
When you're a kid is angry.
The first thing you have to teach your 

2772
01:52:26,361 --> 01:52:26,361
kid is maybe you're wrong to be angry 
sometimes,

2773
01:52:26,361 --> 01:52:26,361
right?

2774
01:52:26,361 --> 01:52:28,650
Your anger is not justified.
If you want to make good human beings,

2775
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:31,320
you have to determine whether they are 
right to be angry.

2776
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:33,060
Is he?
Is your anger correct?

2777
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,640
Politicians are in the business of 
justifying people's anger.

2778
01:52:35,670 --> 01:52:40,670
Oh,
he heard this about the trump voter a 

2779
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:40,670
lot,
right?

2780
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:40,670
They're so angry.
They're so angry.

2781
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:41,580
Okay,
well I'm angry too about things,

2782
01:52:41,581 --> 01:52:43,110
but are they angry about the right 
things?

2783
01:52:43,610 --> 01:52:44,020
Right?
Like,

2784
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:49,180
and trump would say,
you're right to be angry because you've 

2785
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:51,461
lost your job in podunk,
Ohio because it's being stolen by the 

2786
01:52:51,461 --> 01:52:52,250
chinese or by the mexicans or something.
And it's like,

2787
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:57,310
well,
is that factually true or are you just 

2788
01:52:57,310 --> 01:52:59,900
are just pandering to the anger and on 
the left you hear people say this to to 

2789
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:00,830
black folks in the inner city.
It's the system that's keeping you down.

2790
01:53:00,831 --> 01:53:03,080
It's a racist white supremacist system 
that's keeping you down.

2791
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:03,650
Say,
well,

2792
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:05,810
is that true?
or I just pandering to the voter because

2793
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:08,770
it's hard to tell people hard truths 
like you're not right to be angry.

2794
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,310
Get off your ass and do something with 
your life.

2795
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:11,960
and it's true for it,
regardless of race,

2796
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:13,220
you know,
go out there.

2797
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:14,990
No one cares enough to stop you and your
life.

2798
01:53:14,991 --> 01:53:19,991
Your life is your own.
No one in the United States cares about 

2799
01:53:19,991 --> 01:53:19,991
you,
wants to stop you.

2800
01:53:19,991 --> 01:53:21,080
Who wants to throw obstacles up in your 
own way?

2801
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:24,890
I'm not sure you can win an election on 
the basis of go live your own life.

2802
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:26,990
Even though everyone keeps claiming they
want to live their own life.

2803
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:32,380
I think most people are full of it.
I think most people don't want to live 

2804
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:32,380
their own life.
They want a politician to tell them that

2805
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:36,011
all of their complaints about life being
unfair or justified and the politician 

2806
01:53:36,011 --> 01:53:37,070
is going to solve all that.
We don't want people who stay out of our

2807
01:53:37,071 --> 01:53:42,071
way.
We want people to be mommy and and you 

2808
01:53:42,071 --> 01:53:42,071
know that's,
that's attempting,

2809
01:53:42,071 --> 01:53:43,490
attempting proposition for politics.

2810
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:48,910
A lot of that when you talk to adults 
because you're dealing with people that 

2811
01:53:48,910 --> 01:53:51,671
have the momentum of all their failures 
in life and all the different things 

2812
01:53:51,671 --> 01:53:55,361
that are not going right.
And then here they are this moment 

2813
01:53:55,361 --> 01:53:55,361
today,
right now,

2814
01:53:55,361 --> 01:54:00,100
and they want to figure out why and why 
they're not on track in the how to get 

2815
01:54:00,381 --> 01:54:05,381
on track.
And the easiest way is to point the 

2816
01:54:05,381 --> 01:54:06,020
finger or blame someone else and 
everybody has their own hand.

2817
01:54:06,021 --> 01:54:10,220
I'm not saying that people's hands or 
are fair and that person doesn't have it

2818
01:54:10,221 --> 01:54:11,540
easy.
A lot of people that have it easy,

2819
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:13,490
I have it easier than a lot of people 
for sure for sure.

2820
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:18,520
Absolutely.
But the reality is there's a tremendous 

2821
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:21,881
amount of psychological factors that go 
into why someone does or does not 

2822
01:54:23,271 --> 01:54:27,020
succeed and to placate them or to,
you know,

2823
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:32,290
to,
to play on those psychological factors 

2824
01:54:32,290 --> 01:54:32,290
as you know,
not being their own fault.

2825
01:54:32,690 --> 01:54:34,730
It's very tempting because it works with
people.

2826
01:54:34,731 --> 01:54:39,731
People love to hear that.
They love to hear that it's not your 

2827
01:54:39,731 --> 01:54:39,731
fault.

2828
01:54:39,731 --> 01:54:39,731
Yep.
And I think that's what politicians have

2829
01:54:39,731 --> 01:54:42,470
become in the business of doing.
And it's both right and left.

2830
01:54:42,471 --> 01:54:47,471
It's just people saying that it's not 
your fault because you're being screwed 

2831
01:54:47,471 --> 01:54:51,191
by some foreign country.
It's not your fault because the 

2832
01:54:51,191 --> 01:54:51,530
immigrants are doing it to you.
It's not your fault.

2833
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:52,640
Well,
as maybe some.

2834
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:55,160
Maybe some of that's true,
but you have to show me why it's true.

2835
01:54:55,230 --> 01:54:56,540
You have to show me what the actual 
like.

2836
01:54:56,750 --> 01:55:01,750
Did you lose your job because of and 
because of China or did you lose your 

2837
01:55:01,750 --> 01:55:06,641
job because you're in an industry that 
is being crowded out because of 

2838
01:55:06,641 --> 01:55:09,281
technological change and because your 
union struck and created wages too high 

2839
01:55:09,281 --> 01:55:10,850
to be globally competitive.
Like let's look at the actual logic here

2840
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:12,440
is to enhance and then how can we change
it?

2841
01:55:12,441 --> 01:55:13,640
How can we make it better?
How can we.

2842
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:18,880
Is it something we have to do or is it a
matter of you need to broaden your 

2843
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:18,880
skillset.
Like you see a lot of people now who are

2844
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:23,711
stuck in the mindset of 30 years ago 
that you're going to work a job and 

2845
01:55:23,711 --> 01:55:26,861
stayed there for 20 years and then 
you're going to grow and then you're 

2846
01:55:26,861 --> 01:55:28,890
gonna leave with the gold watch and 
that's not the way the job market works 

2847
01:55:28,890 --> 01:55:28,890
anymore.
I mean,

2848
01:55:28,890 --> 01:55:32,801
if you're.
If you're entering the job market right 

2849
01:55:32,801 --> 01:55:32,801
now as a college student,
you can expect that in the next 10 years

2850
01:55:32,801 --> 01:55:33,680
you'll probably work four jobs.
You like the,

2851
01:55:33,690 --> 01:55:38,690
the turnover is too great and you have 
to be constantly increasing your skill 

2852
01:55:38,690 --> 01:55:38,690
set.
Also with

2853
01:55:38,690 --> 01:55:42,630
every new innovation,
there's businesses that branch out 

2854
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:43,980
become new,

2855
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:47,370
and then there's also businesses that 
die and there's no bringing them back.

2856
01:55:47,410 --> 01:55:49,260
You're not going to bring back the 
printing press,

2857
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:52,260
you know,
there's a lot of stuff that I really got

2858
01:55:52,261 --> 01:55:57,261
into printing press industry and tell 
them that try and get elected from the 

2859
01:55:57,261 --> 01:55:57,261
printing press guy.
Well,

2860
01:55:57,261 --> 01:55:58,860
I mean right now they're trying to stop 
automated cars.

2861
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,470
I mean those.
I mean there was a,

2862
01:56:00,490 --> 01:56:01,530
there was a vote,
right?

2863
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:06,560
WaSn't there a vote like within the last
day or two to try to block automated 

2864
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,640
trucks.
Yeah.

2865
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:13,350
Because there's a tremendous amount of 
people that are moving,

2866
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:16,740
but it's going to be a lot more 
efficient when it's not people.

2867
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,870
And you know,
this is the great fallacy that's been.

2868
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:25,130
People have been trying to fight since 
the beginning of the industrial 

2869
01:56:25,130 --> 01:56:25,130
revolution as this idea of,
okay,

2870
01:56:25,130 --> 01:56:28,131
well the new technology is going to kill
jobs and then no one will ever work 

2871
01:56:28,131 --> 01:56:30,891
again,
so we've had the same unemployment rate 

2872
01:56:30,891 --> 01:56:31,140
in this country for the last hundred 
years and the technology is a little bit

2873
01:56:31,141 --> 01:56:31,440
better.

2874
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:34,320
Teamsters convinced congress to block 
driverless trucks.

2875
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:35,520
Yeah,
that's crazy.

2876
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:37,230
That's crazy.
it seems crazy.

2877
01:56:37,231 --> 01:56:39,780
It seems like you're fighting an 
inevitable tied.

2878
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:41,820
Well,
I mean imagine that.

2879
01:56:42,030 --> 01:56:44,880
Like how is that going to work for all 
the other industries that are affected?

2880
01:56:44,881 --> 01:56:49,881
Let's say that you now have your 
artificially raising the prices of all 

2881
01:56:49,881 --> 01:56:53,151
the goods that now have to be brought in
by the teamsters and now it's more 

2882
01:56:53,151 --> 01:56:53,190
expensive so it's more money out of your
pocket and my pocket.

2883
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,340
That's money that I'm.
Maybe I was willing to buy american,

2884
01:56:56,341 --> 01:56:58,880
but now I'm going to buy chinese because
I have to feed my family like this is.

2885
01:56:59,410 --> 01:57:01,620
That's not how economics works.
It's just not how economics was there.

2886
01:57:01,621 --> 01:57:04,920
Any argument that they're not ready yet 
that these trucks aren't viable,

2887
01:57:04,921 --> 01:57:07,590
so that that's one of the issues is that
way with a lot of the.

2888
01:57:07,630 --> 01:57:09,970
So the automated trucks basically in 
order for them to work,

2889
01:57:09,971 --> 01:57:13,570
you need dedicated lanes because 
otherwise human error is,

2890
01:57:13,571 --> 01:57:17,370
is such that if like if there's a google
car on the road and you're a bad driver,

2891
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:22,430
the google car is probably going to get 
into a crash or might be more likely to 

2892
01:57:22,430 --> 01:57:22,430
get in a crash then that if it were a 
human driving.

2893
01:57:22,430 --> 01:57:27,321
Have you ever seen people freak out 
those tesla cars and seeing what they 

2894
01:57:27,321 --> 01:57:27,510
could do to them?
I haven't.

2895
01:57:27,690 --> 01:57:32,690
I haven't seen those tests.
I actually saw somebody do it to the 

2896
01:57:32,690 --> 01:57:32,690
google car when you're,
uh,

2897
01:57:32,690 --> 01:57:34,830
when a car is on that automated thing,
if you just swerve at it,

2898
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:37,440
they slam on the brakes and back up on 
you.

2899
01:57:37,610 --> 01:57:39,600
Like people have done it to people and 
filmed it.

2900
01:57:39,630 --> 01:57:43,110
When we see people using automated cars,
it's a,

2901
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:45,270
it's,
it's not done.

2902
01:57:45,450 --> 01:57:47,650
It's not ready.
Yeah,

2903
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:49,170
it's in the mix.
Again,

2904
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:52,350
it's sort of like a hell.
There's a lot of fuel efficient,

2905
01:57:52,351 --> 01:57:57,351
lighter cars on the road,
but there are a lot more dangerous than 

2906
01:57:57,351 --> 01:57:57,351
the heavIer cars because they're heavier
cars.

2907
01:57:57,351 --> 01:57:58,140
The clunkers are still around from 1970 
in their tanks.

2908
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:03,560
They just run through three prius's.
How do you feel about universal basic 

2909
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:04,710
income,
because that's a subject that comes up a

2910
01:58:04,711 --> 01:58:09,711
lot lately.
When elon musk is talking about these 

2911
01:58:09,711 --> 01:58:12,771
driverless cars,
one of the things he's saying is that 

2912
01:58:12,771 --> 01:58:14,220
one thing that we're going to need is 
universal basic income.

2913
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:19,250
He said,
we're going to have to figure out some 

2914
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:20,160
way to feed all these people that are 
going to get taken out of the job market

2915
01:58:20,161 --> 01:58:21,960
because their jobs have become 
irrelevant.

2916
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:27,020
So I think that universal basic income 
is for when the technology gets so good 

2917
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:28,170
that they're legitimately are no jobs.
I don't think that we're there yet.

2918
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:31,380
So if you have a machine that can make 
everything basically for free,

2919
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:34,320
and then there's a bunch of people who 
you don't need anymore to do work,

2920
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:39,740
then you can talk about a universal 
basic income because there's no 

2921
01:58:39,740 --> 01:58:42,111
scarcity.
Scarcity is what creates a need for 

2922
01:58:42,111 --> 01:58:42,111
labor.
So if their scarcity in any,

2923
01:58:42,111 --> 01:58:42,111
then there's

2924
01:58:42,111 --> 01:58:44,650
going to be a need for for labor,
there's going to be need for new labour.

2925
01:58:44,651 --> 01:58:49,651
People are going to still have to work 
on these trucks and deal with 

2926
01:58:49,651 --> 01:58:50,050
technology.
And the computer industry didn't destroy

2927
01:58:50,051 --> 01:58:52,060
jobs all over the United States on 
typewriters went out.

2928
01:58:52,061 --> 01:58:55,570
So I think it's a little premature.
I'm not sure there'll ever be a day when

2929
01:58:55,571 --> 01:58:58,840
there's a machine that when the machines
society is so well developed that it can

2930
01:58:58,841 --> 01:59:03,841
take over all jobs.
I do think you'Re seeing a bifurcation 

2931
01:59:03,841 --> 01:59:06,421
in the labor market.
So think people who Are in jobs like 

2932
01:59:06,421 --> 01:59:06,421
yours and mine,
like we're lucky this is a creative job.

2933
01:59:06,421 --> 01:59:10,540
It's hard for machines to create.
But for jobs that are single task jobs,

2934
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:14,800
a lot more of those are going to be 
technologically driven and so people are

2935
01:59:14,801 --> 01:59:15,540
going to have to,
you know,

2936
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:20,580
work the right side of their brain a 
little bit and we're going to have to 

2937
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:20,580
train people in a different way.

2938
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:23,940
But my perspective on universal basic 
income is when you have a four percent 

2939
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:26,881
unemployment rate,
it's very difficult to say you need a 

2940
01:59:26,881 --> 01:59:26,881
universal basic income.
It's again,

2941
01:59:26,881 --> 01:59:29,500
96 percent of people in the labor market
who can work are working.

2942
01:59:29,501 --> 01:59:31,100
so that's not,
that's not,

2943
01:59:31,170 --> 01:59:36,170
that's not suggesting to me that there's
this vast underclass of people who are 

2944
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:36,940
totally incapable of working.
And once you do that,

2945
01:59:36,970 --> 01:59:41,970
you see what you've seen actually with 
the disability programs in the United 

2946
01:59:41,970 --> 01:59:41,970
States,
right?

2947
01:59:41,970 --> 01:59:45,210
where now everybody's on disability.
Like the fastest growing government 

2948
01:59:45,210 --> 01:59:48,181
program in America is the disability 
program or people declare themselves 

2949
01:59:48,181 --> 01:59:49,030
disabled so they can get government 
pensions basically.

2950
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:52,600
Once you have a universal basic income,
is there an incentive to work?

2951
01:59:52,601 --> 01:59:55,660
And also I'm not sure that you've solved
a lot of people's problems,

2952
01:59:55,661 --> 01:59:57,700
like people still see need something to 
do with their day.

2953
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:03,900
Sixteen year olds.
Do you see who retire and they're dead 

2954
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:03,900
within three years.

2955
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:06,570
The utopian ideas that somehow or 
another you're going to open up these 

2956
02:00:06,570 --> 02:00:07,670
people's inherent creativity and they'll
find stuff.

2957
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:09,450
Yeah,
the actually enjoy the country.

2958
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:09,870
Julio,
I mean,

2959
02:00:09,871 --> 02:00:11,760
how many people say again?

2960
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:15,590
You said who we like 30 2:33?
Yeah.

2961
02:00:16,950 --> 02:00:19,070
Thirty three to using the term holy.
Yeah,

2962
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:19,660
I love it.

2963
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:21,030
Yeah.
Again,

2964
02:00:21,630 --> 02:00:22,280
you know,
I'm,

2965
02:00:22,310 --> 02:00:27,310
I'm never,
I hope I'd never retire because I just 

2966
02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:27,310
know too many people who retired and 
they're,

2967
02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:31,130
oh,
I'm going to retire and I'm going to 

2968
02:00:31,130 --> 02:00:32,321
golf there.
Other paint I'm going to trY and six 

2969
02:00:32,321 --> 02:00:32,321
months later they're dead.

2970
02:00:32,321 --> 02:00:36,310
Yeah,
well people enjoy doing things and 

2971
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:36,310
feeling like they're valuable.
You know,

2972
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:38,630
and I don't know if that necessarily has
to be a job,

2973
02:00:38,631 --> 02:00:41,930
but it's a very clear,
definitive test of whether or not you're

2974
02:00:41,931 --> 02:00:46,931
valuable.
If somebody gives you money and you get 

2975
02:00:46,931 --> 02:00:46,931
that money,
you're like,

2976
02:00:46,931 --> 02:00:46,931
look,
I'm valuable.

2977
02:00:46,931 --> 02:00:47,900
I'm doing something.
I'm contributing.

2978
02:00:47,901 --> 02:00:48,890
I got a check for my.

2979
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:49,760
We.
Exactly.

2980
02:00:50,130 --> 02:00:55,130
There's,
there's a lot of hours in the day and 

2981
02:00:55,130 --> 02:00:56,791
it's going to be hard to fill that with 
watercolor painting and beat poetry 

2982
02:00:56,791 --> 02:00:56,791
classes.

2983
02:00:56,791 --> 02:00:56,791
I don't know,
man.

2984
02:00:56,791 --> 02:00:59,540
I'd find shit to do but I see.
But I,

2985
02:01:00,230 --> 02:01:02,900
I've been fairly self employed most of 
my life.

2986
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:04,320
I just have gotten in

2987
02:01:04,670 --> 02:01:06,390
driven.
Like I would find stuff to do too,

2988
02:01:06,430 --> 02:01:08,260
but there is a difference in,
you know,

2989
02:01:08,270 --> 02:01:13,270
not all human beings are the people who 
would actually go out and take classes 

2990
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:13,270
and find things to do.

2991
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:16,220
Do you have aspirations outside of 
commentary when it comes to politics?

2992
02:01:16,730 --> 02:01:21,730
Maybe some point down the road.
Do you think you run for president or 

2993
02:01:21,730 --> 02:01:21,730
something like that

2994
02:01:21,730 --> 02:01:21,730
and the.
Apparently anyone can.

2995
02:01:21,730 --> 02:01:22,150
And this is what I'm finding.
Yeah.

2996
02:01:22,410 --> 02:01:24,640
So,
but you're a reasonable guy.

2997
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:27,000
I don't know.
I mean I,

2998
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:30,400
I like what I'm doing in the sense that 
I get to work on what people believe,

2999
02:01:30,401 --> 02:01:32,650
which I think is sort of the root of,
of politics.

3000
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:36,310
I'm not sure implementing is the same 
thing as I said,

3001
02:01:36,311 --> 02:01:40,310
I'm not sure that the president can get 
like I'm more focused getting people to

3002
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:42,740
think in the terms that I'd like them to
think,

3003
02:01:42,741 --> 02:01:47,741
you know,
about limited government and you taking 

3004
02:01:47,741 --> 02:01:47,741
control of your own life and it might be
able to do more good.

3005
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:50,750
Promulgating that message using a 
growing media.

3006
02:01:50,751 --> 02:01:51,180
I'm like,
we're,

3007
02:01:51,181 --> 02:01:51,860
we're very lucky.
I mean,

3008
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:54,500
the podcast went from having 3000 
listeners,

3009
02:01:54,990 --> 02:01:59,990
you know,
a 300 episodes ago to now we have 

3010
02:01:59,990 --> 02:01:59,990
300,000
listeners a day,

3011
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:00,120
you know,
so it's,

3012
02:02:00,121 --> 02:02:01,280
it's,
it continues to grow.

3013
02:02:01,281 --> 02:02:06,281
So as that crowd continues to grow,
it's actually harder for me to say I'd 

3014
02:02:06,281 --> 02:02:06,281
want to jump into politics.
Not easier.

3015
02:02:06,281 --> 02:02:09,890
I think the limited government thing to 
me has always been a fascinating subject

3016
02:02:09,891 --> 02:02:12,200
because the people that don't want 
limited government,

3017
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:16,510
that is the utopian ideal in my mind 
that somehow or another the government's

3018
02:02:16,511 --> 02:02:18,500
going to be effective if you give them 
more money,

3019
02:02:18,940 --> 02:02:23,940
like,
well this isn't an argument with a 

3020
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:25,961
friend where he wanted people to be 
taxed more because he felt like that 

3021
02:02:26,451 --> 02:02:31,451
money could be distributed to people and
you would get more funding for the arts 

3022
02:02:32,691 --> 02:02:34,070
was one of his arguments,
but it,

3023
02:02:34,071 --> 02:02:35,600
my,
my thought was like first of all,

3024
02:02:35,810 --> 02:02:37,530
the arts,
like when they're valued,

3025
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:39,080
when people like them,
they pay for them.

3026
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:44,280
If that's not getting funding for the 
arts means you're going to have fucking 

3027
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,340
lacma,
la county museum of art.

3028
02:02:45,410 --> 02:02:50,410
You have a fuckIng box on the ground.
Let's someone's calling a piece of art 

3029
02:02:50,410 --> 02:02:52,300
that guy think he went to.
It was either in san francisco or lack,

3030
02:02:52,301 --> 02:02:57,301
but where he went there and he took off 
his glasses and he just put them on the 

3031
02:02:57,301 --> 02:02:58,010
floor and then he stood next to them 
going kind of standing there and kind of

3032
02:02:58,011 --> 02:03:03,011
stroking his chin scene.
There were 30 people all around and 

3033
02:03:03,011 --> 02:03:03,011
staring at the glasses on the floor.
It's like,

3034
02:03:03,011 --> 02:03:03,150
it's amazing.
Yeah,

3035
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:04,730
it's fucking horseshit,
right?

3036
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:07,730
That the modern art exhibits.
Like there's.

3037
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:12,820
There was another one recently where 
someone like left behind a pineapple or 

3038
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:12,820
something.
Listen to the.

3039
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:12,820
I remember this.
Yeah.

3040
02:03:12,820 --> 02:03:14,150
Yeah.
It's crazy.

3041
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:19,300
It really is crazy and it's also 
pretentious and it's also a stoking 

3042
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:23,561
those fires of pretension and making 
something that's not legitimately 

3043
02:03:23,561 --> 02:03:23,561
creative.

3044
02:03:23,561 --> 02:03:27,970
Making it a celebrated because you don't
really have the ability to create 

3045
02:03:27,970 --> 02:03:31,811
something that's legitimately creative 
as pointing this out today with regard 

3046
02:03:31,811 --> 02:03:35,411
to.
It's funny how a lot of people who want 

3047
02:03:35,411 --> 02:03:37,181
bigger government,
they embrace states that start to grow 

3048
02:03:37,181 --> 02:03:37,181
the government and then when things go 
to shit,

3049
02:03:37,181 --> 02:03:41,650
they're like nowhere to be found.
So Venezuela is the most obvious 

3050
02:03:41,650 --> 02:03:41,650
example,
right?

3051
02:03:41,650 --> 02:03:44,270
Venezuela has turned from what was the 
richest country in south America and had

3052
02:03:44,271 --> 02:03:46,400
the best oil reserves of anywhere in the
western hemisphere.

3053
02:03:46,401 --> 02:03:48,680
Basically they've turned it into just a 
garbage heap.

3054
02:03:48,681 --> 02:03:50,840
People waiting in lines have a friend 
named nami horwitz.

3055
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:52,880
Went down there,
did some documentary stuff down there,

3056
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:55,370
and he was a,
I think it's camera man got shot.

3057
02:03:55,580 --> 02:04:00,580
He was,
he was watching people like literally 

3058
02:04:00,580 --> 02:04:00,580
shooting dogs in the streets for food.
And this is,

3059
02:04:00,580 --> 02:04:00,580
I mean it's.

3060
02:04:00,580 --> 02:04:03,020
Caracas is the most violent city in the 
western hemisphere now.

3061
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:08,440
And all of this is because google chavez
was a piece of garbage who centralized 

3062
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:13,331
all power to himself,
redistributed the wealth to all of his 

3063
02:04:13,331 --> 02:04:16,301
friends and cronies and then,
and then supposedly uplifted the poor 

3064
02:04:16,301 --> 02:04:18,040
except that now everyone is poor.
Wait a minute,

3065
02:04:18,090 --> 02:04:20,690
wasn't even friends with sean penn.
So I don't even know what you're saying.

3066
02:04:20,691 --> 02:04:21,380
Yeah,
exactly.

3067
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:23,900
So,
so I might show today I played like sean

3068
02:04:23,901 --> 02:04:26,510
penn and Jesse Jackson and,
and uh,

3069
02:04:26,750 --> 02:04:31,750
that freak,
jeremy corbyn who's the head of the 

3070
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:31,790
labor party in great britain and they're
all just praising chavez,

3071
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,800
right?
He's a great guy.

3072
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:37,440
He waS a hero to the poor and now 
Venezuela is going to shit.

3073
02:04:37,441 --> 02:04:38,070
And where all these

3074
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:43,070
people,
like when someone's stick a camera in 

3075
02:04:43,070 --> 02:04:43,390
sean penn split face like now and just 
asking sean penn,

3076
02:04:43,391 --> 02:04:45,090
so like five minutes ago you were saying
this one

3077
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:50,100
who's awesome.
Well there's gotta be some sort of a 

3078
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:50,100
left response for that.
like what is,

3079
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:50,160
what is their take on why?

3080
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:52,450
So the no true scotsman fallacy,
right?

3081
02:04:52,451 --> 02:04:52,840
They,
oh well,

3082
02:04:52,841 --> 02:04:57,841
you know,
this is them living on and it's because 

3083
02:04:57,841 --> 02:04:57,841
they never really got rid of enough 
private industry.

3084
02:04:57,841 --> 02:04:58,450
If theY just gone further,
it would have been better.

3085
02:04:58,451 --> 02:05:00,100
It's like,
well the soviet union and it didn't work

3086
02:05:00,101 --> 02:05:03,370
out that great either,
but like I actually got a response.

3087
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:08,400
It was really funny.
the today I tweeted out that according 

3088
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:10,951
to the world bank,
Venezuela has one of the least income 

3089
02:05:10,951 --> 02:05:11,860
unequal societies on earth.
So it's actually pretty income equal,

3090
02:05:12,130 --> 02:05:13,510
right?
Cause nobody has anything right.

3091
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:16,420
And the end it's garbage.
And so the,

3092
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:21,480
the socialist,
the official socialist party tweeted me 

3093
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:22,660
and they said this is because socialism 
has never truly been tried.

3094
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,080
Okay dude.
All right.

3095
02:05:26,470 --> 02:05:27,550
sure.
Why not?

3096
02:05:29,250 --> 02:05:34,250
Well that was the wonderful idea of 
socialism is that it's going to even 

3097
02:05:34,250 --> 02:05:37,570
everything out and that you shouldn't 
get paid more for that no one should get

3098
02:05:37,571 --> 02:05:42,571
paid more and then everyone should have 
some sort of a like a peak that you can 

3099
02:05:42,571 --> 02:05:42,640
reach,
right?

3100
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:44,650
Like there's some sort of competition 
involved,

3101
02:05:44,860 --> 02:05:47,500
but he's got to be some.
TheRe's got to be some sort of incentive

3102
02:05:47,501 --> 02:05:48,250
but only so much.

3103
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:53,300
Right.
Just like the bernie sanders's 

3104
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:54,441
democratic socialism,
like formal socialism is the state owns 

3105
02:05:54,441 --> 02:05:57,021
the whole thing.
But democratic socialism is there's 

3106
02:05:57,021 --> 02:05:57,021
private industry but only to a certain 
point.

3107
02:05:57,021 --> 02:05:57,180
And then we tell people no.

3108
02:05:57,550 --> 02:06:01,280
Did you find out about bernie and his 
wife and his wife's idea was to buy up a

3109
02:06:01,281 --> 02:06:06,281
bunch of land and expand the college and
then the fucking college went under and 

3110
02:06:06,281 --> 02:06:07,920
now they're being sued.
Yeah.

3111
02:06:07,940 --> 02:06:10,050
Come on man.
It's awesome

3112
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:15,240
based on,
on a lot of mythmaking about like 

3113
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:15,240
western europe in the Netherlands,
right?

3114
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:17,590
So there's All this stuff.
Democratic socialist countries.

3115
02:06:17,591 --> 02:06:18,640
They're working great.
First of all,

3116
02:06:19,060 --> 02:06:24,060
a car in Denmark has a 60 percent import
tax and costs literally twice what it 

3117
02:06:24,060 --> 02:06:27,871
would cost in the United States.
Tax rates in Denmark are insane except 

3118
02:06:27,871 --> 02:06:31,860
for corporate taxes,
which the left in the United States 

3119
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:31,860
really,
you know,

3120
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:31,860
they love corporate tax.
They want those higher.

3121
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:36,960
Denmark has some of the lowest corporate
taxes and regulations in the 

3122
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:39,541
industrialized world.
so everybody is coming in and investing 

3123
02:06:39,541 --> 02:06:41,941
in Denmark.
It's only the citizens who are getting 

3124
02:06:41,941 --> 02:06:41,941
screwed by paying for this giant welfare
state.

3125
02:06:41,941 --> 02:06:42,940
Then their gdp tanked and now they've 
had to elect,

3126
02:06:42,941 --> 02:06:45,430
right wing governments just lash back.
The the level of government.

3127
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:50,431
I mean it turns out the capitalism is 
the great engine that drives like 

3128
02:06:50,431 --> 02:06:50,890
Singapore is.
There's nothing on Singapore.

3129
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:54,190
Singapore is like a rock it.
There's nothing there.

3130
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:59,280
Singapore has one,
the most powerful economIes on earth 

3131
02:06:59,280 --> 02:06:59,280
because they basically have no business 
regulations,

3132
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:02,380
no taxes and no tariffs so that you can 
do whatever you want and when people can

3133
02:07:02,381 --> 02:07:07,381
do whatever they want,
they make a lot of mutually beneficial 

3134
02:07:07,381 --> 02:07:07,381
exchanges and of story.
This is not that difficult,

3135
02:07:07,381 --> 02:07:11,670
but.
But it is difficult if you think that 

3136
02:07:11,670 --> 02:07:11,670
life is unfair.
Right?

3137
02:07:11,670 --> 02:07:14,790
So what would you propose?
Like what would you propose for the 

3138
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:17,761
United States?
Like the United States obviously would 

3139
02:07:17,761 --> 02:07:18,460
trump wants to do is reinvigorate 
manufacturing,

3140
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:23,290
make things in America again,
bring back the labor force,

3141
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:28,320
make the take away the jobs that are 
going overseas and other countries in 

3142
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:28,320
south America.
Okay.

3143
02:07:28,460 --> 02:07:33,460
So I think that that's a bunch of 
slogans from him and I don't think it 

3144
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:33,460
means and it so,
so number one,

3145
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:36,010
I don't think a manufacturing job is 
more than a tech job.

3146
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:39,220
A job is a job and in industries that 
are thriving,

3147
02:07:39,221 --> 02:07:41,950
you actually need more jobs and 
industries tHat are not doing as well.

3148
02:07:41,951 --> 02:07:46,951
If the jobs disappear,
that's just the wages of a global 

3149
02:07:46,951 --> 02:07:46,951
economy.
And that's.

3150
02:07:46,951 --> 02:07:48,460
I know it sounds harsh to people who are
in those industries,

3151
02:07:48,461 --> 02:07:50,290
but it's not a referendum on you or your
value.

3152
02:07:50,291 --> 02:07:52,030
it's just saying that certain industries
over time,

3153
02:07:52,150 --> 02:07:57,150
always our outsource,
like we used to make tee shirts in the 

3154
02:07:57,150 --> 02:07:57,150
United States.
We don't make tee shirts here,

3155
02:07:57,150 --> 02:07:57,940
make them in Vietnam and it costs us 
five bucks.

3156
02:07:58,330 --> 02:07:58,660
Right?
So,

3157
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:01,870
so the.
So my view is I'm not going to Privilege

3158
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:03,820
one day.
I understand a lot of this is politics.

3159
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:06,370
You want to favor manufacturing basis 
because there are a lot of manufacturing

3160
02:08:06,371 --> 02:08:07,540
hubs in Pennsylvania,
Ohio,

3161
02:08:07,541 --> 02:08:08,740
Michigan,
Wisconsin.

3162
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:10,690
But then they vote since I don't care,
right?

3163
02:08:10,691 --> 02:08:15,691
Since I'm not a politician,
my view is that if you want a thriving 

3164
02:08:15,691 --> 02:08:18,811
economy,
you relieve as much regulation as 

3165
02:08:18,811 --> 02:08:18,811
possible.
He lowered the taxes for everyone,

3166
02:08:18,811 --> 02:08:22,650
personal and corporate.
You attract as much foreign investment 

3167
02:08:22,650 --> 02:08:25,021
as possible and you allow people to 
build businesses with as little risk as 

3168
02:08:25,021 --> 02:08:27,991
possible and then you allow them to 
compete and if they succeed they 

3169
02:08:27,991 --> 02:08:27,991
succeed.
And if they fail,

3170
02:08:27,991 --> 02:08:32,161
they fail and you get rid of tariffs as 
well because I want cheap inputs for my 

3171
02:08:32,161 --> 02:08:35,791
products and I want you products on the 
shelves at the store so I don't have to 

3172
02:08:35,791 --> 02:08:35,791
pay a bajillion dollars for a pair of 
shoes.

3173
02:08:35,791 --> 02:08:36,640
So I'm,
I'm,

3174
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:40,030
my view of this is that economics is an 
element of freedom.

3175
02:08:40,330 --> 02:08:42,190
I am a free person.
I get to do with my money.

3176
02:08:42,191 --> 02:08:47,191
What I damn well please.
And you don't get to stand in my way 

3177
02:08:47,191 --> 02:08:47,191
unless there is some sort of moral 
thing,

3178
02:08:47,191 --> 02:08:47,300
right?
LIke if you,

3179
02:08:47,301 --> 02:08:47,890
if you want to say,
well,

3180
02:08:47,950 --> 02:08:50,560
let's put sanctions on.
Let's put sanctions on Iran.

3181
02:08:50,561 --> 02:08:51,610
let's put sanctions on China,
right?

3182
02:08:51,611 --> 02:08:54,730
China is funding North Korea right now.
It hurts our national security.

3183
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:59,880
We want to put sanctions on China to try
and pressure them into ending North 

3184
02:08:59,880 --> 02:08:59,880
Korea.
That's a national security thing.

3185
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:04,140
But the idea that like today,
trump rolled out this new plan on 

3186
02:09:04,140 --> 02:09:05,680
immigration and he says,
I want to cut down on legal immigration,

3187
02:09:06,160 --> 02:09:11,160
but the reason is because I want to 
raise wages of people in the United 

3188
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:11,160
States.
And I think,

3189
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:15,181
well that's not productive because what 
you're actually doing is you're 

3190
02:09:15,181 --> 02:09:17,860
restricting the supply of labor 
artificially increasing the wages,

3191
02:09:17,980 --> 02:09:22,980
which artificially increases prices,
which means it's not competitive on a 

3192
02:09:22,980 --> 02:09:23,410
global scale,
which means the companies outsource,

3193
02:09:23,820 --> 02:09:28,820
right?
So it's the exact same thing as minimum 

3194
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:30,271
wage.
You create a minimum wage or 

3195
02:09:30,271 --> 02:09:30,271
artificially increasing wages that 
increases prices,

3196
02:09:30,271 --> 02:09:31,030
that makes it noncompetitive.
People outsource.

3197
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:33,910
So it actually achieves the opposite of 
what you're trying to achieve.

3198
02:09:34,180 --> 02:09:39,180
All government intervention in the 
economy save for interventions that are 

3199
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:39,880
designed to prevent externalities.
You know,

3200
02:09:39,881 --> 02:09:42,970
things that I do that hurt you.
All of those are unjustified in my view.

3201
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:44,480
What about our environmental?

3202
02:09:44,870 --> 02:09:45,970
So those are externalities,
right?

3203
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,770
Right.
So like if I were to pollute a river I,

3204
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:49,220
it's not my river,
I don't get to pollute it.

3205
02:09:49,610 --> 02:09:51,650
I get to throw my trash over my fence 
into your yard.

3206
02:09:51,950 --> 02:09:52,280
Right.
That's,

3207
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:53,360
that's,
that's a different thing.

3208
02:09:53,630 --> 02:09:53,900
That's it.

3209
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:55,640
Yeah.
That's one of the most distUrbing things

3210
02:09:55,641 --> 02:10:00,641
about this administration is the cutting
the funding for the environmental 

3211
02:10:00,641 --> 02:10:03,380
protection agency in the changing of 
their Standards are removing some of the

3212
02:10:03,381 --> 02:10:08,381
funding for things like satellites that 
they using to track the climate change 

3213
02:10:08,381 --> 02:10:10,640
and things along those lines.
And I that,

3214
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:13,780
that scares the shit out of me.
Like it scares the shit out of me.

3215
02:10:13,830 --> 02:10:17,960
They're going to ignore the environment 
in favor of the economy.

3216
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:23,020
So I think that some of the 
environmental regulations are badly 

3217
02:10:23,020 --> 02:10:24,200
drawn and some of them are overwrought 
when it comes to,

3218
02:10:24,201 --> 02:10:25,130
for example,
fracking,

3219
02:10:25,220 --> 02:10:30,220
you know,
obama pushed a lot of environmental 

3220
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:30,220
regulations on fracking or the keystone 
xl pipeline,

3221
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:31,630
that kind of thing.
How do you feel about fracking?

3222
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:32,280
Uh,
I'm,

3223
02:10:32,310 --> 02:10:33,800
I'm very in favor of fracking.

3224
02:10:33,810 --> 02:10:38,810
But what do you think about,
like when you hear stories about more 

3225
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:41,100
earthquakes happening and the in stable.

3226
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:44,340
So water supplies the water table,
from what I've seen,

3227
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:49,400
the,
the earthquake evidence is 

3228
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:49,400
extraordinarily weak.
Yeah.

3229
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:49,740
And it's,
from what I've seen,

3230
02:10:49,770 --> 02:10:50,110
you know,
I'm,

3231
02:10:50,111 --> 02:10:50,760
I'm,
again,

3232
02:10:50,761 --> 02:10:52,410
if you present me evidence that I find 
convincing,

3233
02:10:52,411 --> 02:10:53,640
I'm happy to change my mind on this.
Right.

3234
02:10:53,790 --> 02:10:54,710
Um,
and uh,

3235
02:10:54,711 --> 02:10:56,550
as far as the,
as far as water pollution,

3236
02:10:56,551 --> 02:10:57,840
again,
the evidence has Been pretty weak.

3237
02:10:57,870 --> 02:11:02,250
So if that changes then I'm happy to 
regulate it.

3238
02:11:02,251 --> 02:11:04,230
As far as when you say it's been weak,
there's,

3239
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:07,590
there has been instances of fracking 
leading to pollution,

3240
02:11:07,591 --> 02:11:08,550
right?
Sure.

3241
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:10,980
But that's not every fracking leads to 
pollution.

3242
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:16,200
And so the question is coming on as the 
regulation or how many are you willing 

3243
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:16,200
to accept?
Right.

3244
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:17,150
Which is the truth for all business,
right?

3245
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:21,360
I'm like how much we all drive cars,
how much water bottles?

3246
02:11:21,480 --> 02:11:23,460
Somewhere there's a seagull choking on a
cap.

3247
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:28,520
Correct.
So like how much are you willing to 

3248
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:30,351
accept?
Like what I don't appreciate is when 

3249
02:11:30,351 --> 02:11:30,351
people kind of.
What's the evidence when it's like,

3250
02:11:30,351 --> 02:11:32,010
oh well I accept my set my water on fire
because of fracking.

3251
02:11:32,011 --> 02:11:32,640
It's like,
no,

3252
02:11:32,641 --> 02:11:34,680
that's not because of fracking.
That's because of the ground water.

3253
02:11:34,681 --> 02:11:36,190
But in any case,
the,

3254
02:11:36,310 --> 02:11:36,810
you know,
the,

3255
02:11:36,890 --> 02:11:38,910
as far as the satellites in,
in global warming,

3256
02:11:39,240 --> 02:11:40,510
um,
listen,

3257
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:44,400
I think that it's pretty clear that the 
climate is warming,

3258
02:11:44,660 --> 02:11:46,620
mean the greenhouse gas effect is a 
thing.

3259
02:11:47,130 --> 02:11:50,130
The question to me is less whether it's 
happening and more,

3260
02:11:50,131 --> 02:11:55,131
what are you going to do about it 
because even the left seems to have no 

3261
02:11:55,131 --> 02:11:58,710
real solutions as to what to do except 
for massively cutting economic growth.

3262
02:11:59,130 --> 02:12:02,940
And it seems to me that if we're talking
about an increase according the epcc,

3263
02:12:02,950 --> 02:12:07,950
If something like seven degrees 
fahrenheit over the course of the next 

3264
02:12:07,950 --> 02:12:07,950
century,
then on average,

3265
02:12:07,950 --> 02:12:07,950
right,
not,

3266
02:12:07,950 --> 02:12:12,530
not universally on average,
then it seems to me that it's easier to 

3267
02:12:12,530 --> 02:12:17,421
just say that the climate changes over 
time and maybe cities that are on the 

3268
02:12:17,421 --> 02:12:17,430
coast are going to have to pull back a 
little bit over time,

3269
02:12:17,431 --> 02:12:18,720
like a 100 years,
a long time,

3270
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:24,280
a 100 years ago you would've said that 
the pollution was the chief thing to 

3271
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:28,881
worry about in the United States because
we were all using smoke stacks and 

3272
02:12:28,881 --> 02:12:28,881
parts.

3273
02:12:28,881 --> 02:12:28,881
Intuit's.
Yeah,

3274
02:12:28,881 --> 02:12:29,010
exactly.
And now,

3275
02:12:29,100 --> 02:12:31,980
not relieving to regulation,
but just through market competition,

3276
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:37,320
uh,
you've gotten better environmental 

3277
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:39,950
products.
So I think that the market does take 

3278
02:12:39,950 --> 02:12:40,560
care of a lot of these things.
People don't actually want to live in,

3279
02:12:40,710 --> 02:12:42,030
in human waste,
you know,

3280
02:12:42,031 --> 02:12:44,550
like we actually don't want to do that.
So that has been disturbed.

3281
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:49,560
Remain recently is how many times I see 
bill nye on tv talking about climate 

3282
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:49,560
change.

3283
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:50,540
What did he say?
Like again,

3284
02:12:50,570 --> 02:12:52,710
he's,
he has the same qualifications either.

3285
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:57,720
I mean,
here's like a mechanical engineering 

3286
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:57,720
degree.
Yeah.

3287
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:57,720
Well it's kind of a comedian.
Yeah.

3288
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:59,120
I mean I think he is from my childhood.
Yes.

3289
02:12:59,150 --> 02:13:01,550
I believe he was a comedian.
Is a standup guy.

3290
02:13:01,551 --> 02:13:02,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

3291
02:13:02,450 --> 02:13:02,960
And

3292
02:13:03,710 --> 02:13:05,170
he does.
Did you ever see his,

3293
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:07,670
his thing with tucker carlson,
which was great,

3294
02:13:07,980 --> 02:13:09,410
tucker carlson kept saying,
okay,

3295
02:13:09,590 --> 02:13:14,590
but you're talking about science.
So tell me how much of an effect do 

3296
02:13:14,590 --> 02:13:16,750
human beings have on climate change and 
what,

3297
02:13:16,770 --> 02:13:18,170
what is,
what's the science?

3298
02:13:18,380 --> 02:13:21,110
Me.
And all he wanted to say was that,

3299
02:13:21,111 --> 02:13:21,690
you know,
are you

3300
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:23,160
consensus settle.
Yeah,

3301
02:13:23,170 --> 02:13:24,020
exactly.
And like,

3302
02:13:24,070 --> 02:13:26,680
what is,
what is the difference is changing,

3303
02:13:26,740 --> 02:13:27,490
right?
Give me a range.

3304
02:13:27,491 --> 02:13:28,930
Like it doesn't even have to be an exact
number,

3305
02:13:28,931 --> 02:13:30,670
but give me a range and then tell me,
okay,

3306
02:13:30,671 --> 02:13:33,270
what we have to do in order in your 
opinion,

3307
02:13:33,271 --> 02:13:38,271
in order to stop the climate change 
where it stands or if we can't do that 

3308
02:13:38,271 --> 02:13:39,270
in order to minimize it.
What's the actual risk?

3309
02:13:39,271 --> 02:13:44,271
Also like people keep giving these 
catastrophic scenarios where it looks 

3310
02:13:44,271 --> 02:13:45,210
like the day after tomorrow and dennis 
quaid running into subways and shit.

3311
02:13:45,390 --> 02:13:50,390
It'S like weirder ones.
He said was that we were supposed to 

3312
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:52,911
have an ice age.
Now that's not gonna happen like jesus 

3313
02:13:52,911 --> 02:13:52,911
christ.
Man.

3314
02:13:52,911 --> 02:13:52,911
That's good.
Yeah.

3315
02:13:52,911 --> 02:13:54,390
You know,
randall carlson has been on my podcast a

3316
02:13:54,391 --> 02:13:59,391
few times and he's an expert in 
collisions and asteroid collisions and 

3317
02:13:59,391 --> 02:14:02,190
one of the things he said is he goes,
global warming is not great.

3318
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:05,100
He goes,
but it's way better than global cooling.

3319
02:14:05,130 --> 02:14:07,020
This is true.
This is true in the middle.

3320
02:14:07,021 --> 02:14:08,020
Cool.
And kills everybody.

3321
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:09,380
Right?
The little ice age was,

3322
02:14:09,381 --> 02:14:14,381
was not a good thing for the world.
The global warm period was actUally a 

3323
02:14:14,381 --> 02:14:15,120
pretty good thing for the world.
So I mean this is,

3324
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:20,270
thIs is the other thing is that there 
are costs and benefits to the climate 

3325
02:14:20,270 --> 02:14:20,270
changing which had,
which it has throughout time,

3326
02:14:20,270 --> 02:14:25,010
what are we willing to sacrifice in 
order to prevent in order to make that 

3327
02:14:25,010 --> 02:14:25,010
seven degrees into six degrees.
Right?

3328
02:14:25,010 --> 02:14:29,631
And just losing some coastline is not.
The real issue is far more devastating 

3329
02:14:31,090 --> 02:14:32,970
than losing coast.
So I think that if you're going to worry

3330
02:14:32,971 --> 02:14:34,320
about,
if you're going to worry about,

3331
02:14:34,350 --> 02:14:34,730
you know,
the,

3332
02:14:34,731 --> 02:14:36,370
the emissions problem to worry about 
the,

3333
02:14:36,371 --> 02:14:38,680
the uh,
the c absorption of emissions,

3334
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:44,120
like detoxification of the oceans like 
that seems to me to be a bigger problem 

3335
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:44,190
than the climate changing over time.

3336
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:46,860
We're pretty adaptable.
Like there's a lot of land.

3337
02:14:47,190 --> 02:14:48,960
Okay.
So we move.

3338
02:14:49,740 --> 02:14:53,190
We have historically in venice,
the sea level rises in venice.

3339
02:14:53,191 --> 02:14:54,590
Every year people are going to move.
I mean like,

3340
02:14:54,630 --> 02:14:55,860
that's just,
that's the way It works.

3341
02:14:56,240 --> 02:14:59,640
And there's this weird idea and it's 
true in economics.

3342
02:14:59,641 --> 02:15:02,700
It's true with global warming that where
you were born is where you must die,

3343
02:15:03,150 --> 02:15:04,380
right?
And that you can never move.

3344
02:15:04,470 --> 02:15:05,010
And it's like,
well,

3345
02:15:05,160 --> 02:15:07,290
this is the most mobile society in human
history.

3346
02:15:07,730 --> 02:15:09,750
When you get on a plane and be on the 
other coast in six hours,

3347
02:15:10,390 --> 02:15:12,770
it's easier to move than ever before.
So if,

3348
02:15:12,850 --> 02:15:17,850
if we,
if you really think that the climate is 

3349
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:17,850
that bad,
first of all,

3350
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:17,880
I'd like to ask barbara streisand if 
she's that deeply concerned about global

3351
02:15:17,881 --> 02:15:22,881
warming,
why she doesn't sell the coastline to 

3352
02:15:22,881 --> 02:15:22,881
state,
but it's like,

3353
02:15:22,881 --> 02:15:24,770
am I going to lose a lot of sleep,
have a bunch of hollywood stars lose,

3354
02:15:24,830 --> 02:15:27,840
you know,
five feet off their coastline because we

3355
02:15:27,841 --> 02:15:30,840
dIdn't kill the industry of the United 
States and lose $4,000,000,000,000

3356
02:15:30,841 --> 02:15:31,020
a year.

3357
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:31,890
Like,
no.

3358
02:15:32,030 --> 02:15:35,280
And I'm not really sure that that would 
have worked that way one way or another.

3359
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:41,000
It has been absolutely proven that human
beings are having an effect on the 

3360
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,480
carbon dioxide levels.
Of course.

3361
02:15:42,750 --> 02:15:43,260
Right?
Of course.

3362
02:15:43,261 --> 02:15:44,730
Yeah.
And there's a greenhouse gas effect.

3363
02:15:44,731 --> 02:15:45,990
Sure.
One hundred percent.

3364
02:15:45,991 --> 02:15:50,280
So the modeling's been so wrong that 
like I want it,

3365
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:53,970
there's no level of certitude and then 
there's no level of solution that I know

3366
02:15:53,971 --> 02:15:58,971
for sure is going to do this.
So you're talking about human being 

3367
02:15:58,971 --> 02:15:59,760
suffering in the now for the later and 
let's be real about this.

3368
02:15:59,761 --> 02:16:04,761
Like yes,
there are a lot of emissions from the 

3369
02:16:04,761 --> 02:16:06,321
United States,
but the leading admItter is on the 

3370
02:16:06,321 --> 02:16:07,701
planet right now.
We're trying to nydia and they're not 

3371
02:16:07,701 --> 02:16:07,701
going to stop this shit anytime soon 
like that.

3372
02:16:07,701 --> 02:16:07,710
That's not gonna happen.
Well,

3373
02:16:07,711 --> 02:16:11,400
there's also this thing that happens 
where if you even discuss it,

3374
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:16,460
you become like a hitler or nazi.
You become a climate change denier and 

3375
02:16:17,010 --> 02:16:19,560
once you get locked into one of those 
labels,

3376
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:21,420
you know you,
you're a piece of shit.

3377
02:16:21,450 --> 02:16:22,120
Well this is.
Yeah.

3378
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:25,650
Nobody wants to be locked into those 
labels so that they don't really want to

3379
02:16:25,651 --> 02:16:28,650
have the discussion or the debate.
And that's one of the things that I felt

3380
02:16:28,651 --> 02:16:30,130
like bill nye was not

3381
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:35,130
prepared for because I felt like he's so
lazy with this conversation because so 

3382
02:16:35,130 --> 02:16:35,950
many people just appease him and agree 
with it.

3383
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:40,980
Yeah.
I think that's when tucker carlson was 

3384
02:16:40,980 --> 02:16:42,781
challenging him on it.
He didn't have any data to support this 

3385
02:16:42,781 --> 02:16:44,830
argument.
He just wanted to sort of like play word

3386
02:16:44,831 --> 02:16:46,690
games and,
and have this.

3387
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:47,980
We say,
well,

3388
02:16:47,981 --> 02:16:49,540
you know,
you guys on cnn,

3389
02:16:49,541 --> 02:16:54,541
there was one time when they had some 
guy on who was saying exactly what we 

3390
02:16:54,821 --> 02:16:59,821
were saying,
that the models they have not been 

3391
02:16:59,821 --> 02:17:02,641
proven to be accurate.
And that al gore's movie predicted that 

3392
02:17:02,641 --> 02:17:03,370
we'd be underwater in 2014.
Mike,

3393
02:17:03,371 --> 02:17:04,300
didn't it?
Yeah.

3394
02:17:04,310 --> 02:17:06,130
Mean his predictions and emily are not 
correct.

3395
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:11,250
They're not correct at all.
And he's made some insane amount of 

3396
02:17:11,250 --> 02:17:11,950
money.
He's going to seek out this week.

3397
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:14,440
Isn't he like the first billion dollar 
green guy,

3398
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:19,840
like he's made a shitload of money off 
of giving these speeches and catholic 

3399
02:17:20,141 --> 02:17:20,470
trade.

3400
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:25,540
ANd the whole thing is very strange 
because it becomes this untouchable 

3401
02:17:25,540 --> 02:17:29,851
subject like what We're talking about 
before with transgender people or with 

3402
02:17:29,851 --> 02:17:31,510
many other subjects become.
You can't discuss them.

3403
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:34,630
They're not even open to debate or 
scrutiny.

3404
02:17:34,870 --> 02:17:39,870
They become locked down.
And when tucker carlson was pressing 

3405
02:17:40,151 --> 02:17:42,700
bill now like what is,
what are the numbers?

3406
02:17:42,701 --> 02:17:47,701
Like what is happening?
Tell me how much of an effect are we 

3407
02:17:47,701 --> 02:17:50,401
having.
And bill nye had nothing on it and it 

3408
02:17:50,401 --> 02:17:50,530
just became stammered.
And started getting angry.

3409
02:17:50,531 --> 02:17:51,430
It was like,
wow,

3410
02:17:51,431 --> 02:17:53,650
this is weird.
This is weird to see.

3411
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:55,000
I mean,
if this is the cause of your life,

3412
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:56,710
you know,
a little bit more about it than everyone

3413
02:17:56,711 --> 02:17:59,510
who disagrees is a denier.
And I Think the way tucker handler,

3414
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:04,520
that was brilliant.
I thought it was tucker's best moment I 

3415
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:04,520
think on a show.
Yeah,

3416
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:04,520
I think so too.

3417
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:05,110
Because he was saying essentially he was
like,

3418
02:18:05,111 --> 02:18:07,170
I'm not denying it.
I'm not saying it's.

3419
02:18:07,290 --> 02:18:10,450
I just want you to tell me how much of 
an effect tell me exactly.

3420
02:18:10,460 --> 02:18:11,560
And he had nothing.
It's like,

3421
02:18:11,590 --> 02:18:14,670
so maybe bill nye is the wrong guy.
Tend to have there,

3422
02:18:14,671 --> 02:18:18,760
but I shouldn't be selling himself like 
you can't have me come on a fucking show

3423
02:18:18,761 --> 02:18:21,940
and talk about global warming because I 
don't know anything about it.

3424
02:18:21,941 --> 02:18:23,530
Or at the very least,
bill nye should say,

3425
02:18:23,531 --> 02:18:28,531
listen,
the intergovernmental panel on climate 

3426
02:18:28,531 --> 02:18:28,531
change did this study,
right?

3427
02:18:28,531 --> 02:18:29,950
You can look up the numbers there.
I dOn't have them off the top of my head

3428
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:33,520
or the numbers of the fucking numbers.
You're going to be on one of those shows

3429
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:36,280
seven minutes,
so everybody in the media is lazy.

3430
02:18:36,710 --> 02:18:41,710
Nobody.
Nobody actually does tHeir prep for a 

3431
02:18:41,710 --> 02:18:44,551
debate or for tv appearances like 
because the truth is you think you're 

3432
02:18:44,551 --> 02:18:45,370
going to be on for five having done a 
thousand tv heads at this point.

3433
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:46,750
Most people think,
okay,

3434
02:18:46,751 --> 02:18:48,610
I'm beyond for five minutes.
I can get through five minutes.

3435
02:18:48,611 --> 02:18:53,611
Right?
Like it would be that bad if I'm on for 

3436
02:18:53,611 --> 02:18:53,611
10 minutes,
how bad can it be?

3437
02:18:53,611 --> 02:18:54,910
And the answer is you can get parents 
done nationally in five minutes.

3438
02:18:54,911 --> 02:18:57,520
If the person knows what they're doing.
Well you've done that many people.

3439
02:18:57,521 --> 02:19:00,610
One of the things that I think is do you
talk fast always is like,

3440
02:19:00,760 --> 02:19:02,810
you're Born this way.
My family,

3441
02:19:03,190 --> 02:19:04,870
everyone in my family talks to the 
family.

3442
02:19:04,871 --> 02:19:09,871
Just talks about it because I was 
wondering if this was a strategy to 

3443
02:19:09,871 --> 02:19:09,871
develop to be really good at those 
shows.

3444
02:19:09,871 --> 02:19:10,630
No,
no,

3445
02:19:10,650 --> 02:19:11,290
it's,
it's,

3446
02:19:11,291 --> 02:19:13,450
it's been fortunate that it fits that 
way,

3447
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:16,220
but yeah,
even even my kids talk this way.

3448
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:21,240
Even of the three year old.
This was some people that are just 

3449
02:19:21,240 --> 02:19:21,480
really good at blah blah,
blah blah and you,

3450
02:19:21,481 --> 02:19:23,490
you,
you get them in the podcast and you have

3451
02:19:23,491 --> 02:19:24,290
to like peter shifts.

3452
02:19:24,310 --> 02:19:26,290
A great example though,
after like 20 minutes,

3453
02:19:26,291 --> 02:19:27,160
I'm like,
you want a drink?

3454
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:32,200
Let's have some whiskey.
We had a couple of glasses of clInk 

3455
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:34,810
cheers.
and we settled down and then he settled 

3456
02:19:34,810 --> 02:19:36,881
into like a normal way of talking,
but he's just so used to like force 

3457
02:19:36,881 --> 02:19:39,450
feeding you facts and opinions and ah,
it's just,

3458
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:44,740
it's such an ineffective way to 
communicate with those three heads and 

3459
02:19:44,740 --> 02:19:47,920
the one person who is the host throw the
Megan Kelly throw in a question and then

3460
02:19:48,170 --> 02:19:53,170
this person is talking over that person 
and it's such an ineffective way to 

3461
02:19:53,170 --> 02:19:57,131
communicate.
It's one of the things that I do like 

3462
02:19:57,131 --> 02:19:57,320
about long form podcast,
like this one or like mine,

3463
02:19:57,321 --> 02:19:57,830
I,
I just,

3464
02:19:57,831 --> 02:20:00,890
I liked the ability to actually expand 
on a point on tv.

3465
02:20:00,891 --> 02:20:01,460
It's like,
okay,

3466
02:20:01,461 --> 02:20:03,710
you have 30 seconds of a point.
Excellent.

3467
02:20:03,860 --> 02:20:05,000
We can make that work for us.

3468
02:20:05,060 --> 02:20:09,770
It's the only place left that you can do
this unless you're making youtube videos

3469
02:20:09,771 --> 02:20:11,690
and you know,
Jordan Peterson is obviously finding out

3470
02:20:11,691 --> 02:20:12,670
that that's a problem.
Yeah.

3471
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:17,800
But unless you're doing something along 
those lines where no one's there but you

3472
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:20,330
and you get to expand and express 
yourself.

3473
02:20:20,660 --> 02:20:25,660
There's no other form of conversation 
like podcast where you're not getting 

3474
02:20:25,660 --> 02:20:28,640
interrupted by a commercial.
You're just talking and you know as well

3475
02:20:28,641 --> 02:20:32,420
as I know that conversation sort of 
evolve and move and they,

3476
02:20:32,421 --> 02:20:34,010
you know,
when I get to know you better,

3477
02:20:34,011 --> 02:20:39,011
I see how you're thinking better and I 
kind of have more questions to ask and 

3478
02:20:39,011 --> 02:20:41,780
you expand more and you get to know a 
person for real and that's just those,

3479
02:20:41,870 --> 02:20:46,870
those television shows are so there.
It's so divisive and that way it's hard 

3480
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:48,320
for me to watch cable television because
of that.

3481
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:50,720
I don't feel like I'm getting tons of 
information that way.

3482
02:20:50,750 --> 02:20:52,790
Well,
cnn had nine fucking people on the other

3483
02:20:52,791 --> 02:20:54,980
day and it's crazy.
The candle on cnn.

3484
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:56,540
It's a.
It's hollywood squares now.

3485
02:20:56,670 --> 02:20:57,920
Yeah.
Anderson cooper standing,

3486
02:20:57,950 --> 02:21:01,250
sitting there in the middle and there's 
people and the people that had just made

3487
02:21:01,251 --> 02:21:03,890
a diagonal cool and they're interrupting
each other and said,

3488
02:21:03,891 --> 02:21:05,270
excuse me while I talk.
You might.

3489
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:06,750
You might not interrupting me for a 
moment.

3490
02:21:06,780 --> 02:21:11,780
Like their grand standing and trying to 
have this point they think is going to 

3491
02:21:11,780 --> 02:21:13,850
be a zinger because they wrote it last 
night and it's just like,

3492
02:21:13,910 --> 02:21:18,910
oh,
the best you can hope for is that you 

3493
02:21:18,910 --> 02:21:18,910
have 30 seconds where you say something 
that goes viral.

3494
02:21:18,910 --> 02:21:19,630
That's basically.
That's,

3495
02:21:19,720 --> 02:21:21,170
that's the extent of it.
Yeah.

3496
02:21:21,171 --> 02:21:24,360
well you've done a lot of those.
I won't get good at it.

3497
02:21:24,370 --> 02:21:25,760
I'm good.
you're good at it.

3498
02:21:26,060 --> 02:21:31,060
But it's like we were talking about 
before that a lot of the people that 

3499
02:21:31,060 --> 02:21:31,850
have debated you that are real,
they're really fuckIng lazy.

3500
02:21:32,390 --> 02:21:37,390
Like,
like they have this suppose had passion 

3501
02:21:37,390 --> 02:21:40,541
for something,
but when it comes to preparing for this 

3502
02:21:40,541 --> 02:21:42,860
sort of interaction,
they're not really doing that for sure.

3503
02:21:42,861 --> 02:21:47,861
And I think that part of that is there.
There are people who are experts on 

3504
02:21:47,861 --> 02:21:50,480
particular topics who could,
I'm sure know more about their specialty

3505
02:21:50,481 --> 02:21:55,481
than I do on a lot of topics to discuss 
climate change with the person who was 

3506
02:21:55,481 --> 02:21:56,390
like an expert on climate change.
I would not know as much as that person.

3507
02:21:56,420 --> 02:21:57,540
Sure.
But you know,

3508
02:21:57,560 --> 02:22:02,560
there are a lot of people who think 
they're generalists and have never read 

3509
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:02,560
a book,
you know,

3510
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:05,921
lIke I know one fact about one thing and
it's that you're a denier and if I know 

3511
02:22:05,921 --> 02:22:06,260
too then I beat you.

3512
02:22:06,570 --> 02:22:07,690
So that's what.
That's.

3513
02:22:07,860 --> 02:22:12,860
So the climate denier thing seems to me 
one of the laziest things about the 

3514
02:22:12,921 --> 02:22:17,921
left,
and this is not saying that there's not 

3515
02:22:17,921 --> 02:22:18,650
some sort of a real issue with human 
waste because I think there is,

3516
02:22:18,651 --> 02:22:23,651
I think it's a,
there's a giant issue with plastic in 

3517
02:22:23,651 --> 02:22:23,840
the ocean.
There's a giant issue with pollutants in

3518
02:22:23,841 --> 02:22:28,841
our water system and our air and there's
a lot of issues with the side effects of

3519
02:22:29,281 --> 02:22:32,550
being a person in the industrialized 
civilization.

3520
02:22:32,730 --> 02:22:34,320
There's,
we burn things,

3521
02:22:34,321 --> 02:22:38,670
we create poisons and we've got to 
figure out a way to be sustainable.

3522
02:22:38,730 --> 02:22:40,620
I don't think there's any denying that 
by anybody.

3523
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:43,030
I think it's also worth noting the 
market makes these things better in many

3524
02:22:43,031 --> 02:22:48,031
cases.
I mean the fact is that if you look at 

3525
02:22:48,031 --> 02:22:48,031
the areas where,
for example,

3526
02:22:48,031 --> 02:22:48,820
everyone is down on carbon based fuels,
okay,

3527
02:22:48,821 --> 02:22:53,821
fair enough.
But if you go to places that don't have 

3528
02:22:53,821 --> 02:22:55,951
carbon based fuels,
they're burning animal dung and would 

3529
02:22:55,951 --> 02:22:55,951
there is nothing worse for particulate 
than,

3530
02:22:55,990 --> 02:22:58,150
than animal dung and woods.
So as we get,

3531
02:22:58,240 --> 02:23:00,250
and If we,
if we did even better than than this,

3532
02:23:00,251 --> 02:23:01,990
we would get to nuclear power,
right?

3533
02:23:01,991 --> 02:23:06,991
Which unfortunately,
a lot of people have been because of 

3534
02:23:06,991 --> 02:23:09,270
unbased fears,
like most of france's electricity is 

3535
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:09,270
provided by nuclear power.
and that's about as clean as it gets.

3536
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:10,130
So,
you know,

3537
02:23:10,150 --> 02:23:11,040
I,
I do think so.

3538
02:23:11,050 --> 02:23:13,870
It goes dark well till it goes 
fukushima.

3539
02:23:13,990 --> 02:23:18,990
Hey,
even even in worst case scenario at 

3540
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:18,990
fukushima,
I mean,

3541
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:23,130
if you're talking about the,
if you're talking about global warming 

3542
02:23:23,130 --> 02:23:25,231
and environmental damage,
the amount of environmental damage 

3543
02:23:25,231 --> 02:23:26,380
supposedly done by carbon emissions is a
lot larger than fukushima.

3544
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:28,360
Right?
But the local damage.

3545
02:23:28,390 --> 02:23:28,780
Oh yeah,

3546
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:33,860
that's devastating.
That's a disturbing thing that they 

3547
02:23:33,860 --> 02:23:36,411
don't have a way to stop that,
that like they've figured out a way to 

3548
02:23:36,411 --> 02:23:39,750
like put a wall of ice around the 
containment area and that didn't work.

3549
02:23:39,751 --> 02:23:43,980
It seems so fucking science fictiony and
they really don't know what to do.

3550
02:23:43,981 --> 02:23:44,160
And

3551
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:44,740
uh,
yeah,

3552
02:23:44,741 --> 02:23:47,560
I don't know enough about nuclear 
containment to take off on that one,

3553
02:23:47,580 --> 02:23:52,580
but let's just say that one disaster in 
basically there've been three major 

3554
02:23:53,111 --> 02:23:53,560
disaster,
right?

3555
02:23:53,561 --> 02:23:55,390
Chernobyl,
three mile island and fukushima,

3556
02:23:56,040 --> 02:24:01,040
the only one that's happened,
the two of those three have happened in 

3557
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:01,040
the first world,
right?

3558
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:04,711
Fukushima and three mile island,
three mile island basically ended up 

3559
02:24:04,711 --> 02:24:07,441
having no longterm impacts of cliquish.
Shame is really the only major disaster 

3560
02:24:07,441 --> 02:24:09,070
in 40 years of industrialized countries 
using nuclear power.

3561
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:11,190
Well,
apparently they had some weird meltdowns

3562
02:24:11,191 --> 02:24:14,190
here at rocket.
Don really weren't really discussed.

3563
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:15,780
Yeah,
don't tell aBout it.

3564
02:24:15,810 --> 02:24:16,660
Well,
they're there,

3565
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:20,010
you know,
it was all during the sixties,

3566
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:23,580
fifties or the sixties when they're 
involved in the rocket program.

3567
02:24:23,940 --> 02:24:25,830
But the rocket dyne stuff,
um,

3568
02:24:25,831 --> 02:24:30,831
my friend's dad is a scientist and he 
was explaining to me the half life of 

3569
02:24:30,831 --> 02:24:33,360
whatever was released in the atmosphere.
It's nothing to concerned,

3570
02:24:33,361 --> 02:24:36,600
but there's a bunch of rocket town was 
like right there on the street,

3571
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:41,870
there was a,
a bunch of articles that were written 

3572
02:24:41,870 --> 02:24:45,951
about it,
like worrying about people that have 

3573
02:24:45,951 --> 02:24:46,200
higher cancer rates in this area.
And you know,

3574
02:24:46,590 --> 02:24:51,590
but this also like,
I think there's a website called the 

3575
02:24:51,590 --> 02:24:52,620
sins of rocketdyne.
Really see if you could find that.

3576
02:24:52,740 --> 02:24:55,980
I think there's a website dedicated to 
that that people.

3577
02:24:55,981 --> 02:24:59,160
But there's a lot of cancer just living 
in cities,

3578
02:24:59,161 --> 02:25:04,161
man.
Like they say that one of the worst 

3579
02:25:04,161 --> 02:25:04,380
environments for a human being is living
in a place that has a lot of brake dust.

3580
02:25:04,580 --> 02:25:07,080
Like if you're living in manhattan and 
you get your window open,

3581
02:25:07,081 --> 02:25:10,260
you just inhaling particulates from 
people there.

3582
02:25:10,261 --> 02:25:13,830
it is the sins of rocketdyne.
But the thing is like,

3583
02:25:13,831 --> 02:25:16,920
I mean how much more cancer are these 
people?

3584
02:25:17,070 --> 02:25:17,420
This is from

3585
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:22,890
sometimes the statistics on cancer or 
hard to to correlate because you'll have

3586
02:25:22,900 --> 02:25:27,900
groupings that are sort of weird.
And that's just because random 

3587
02:25:27,900 --> 02:25:30,721
statistical grouping cabins.
So how much of it is due to x factor or 

3588
02:25:30,721 --> 02:25:34,711
why factor.
If we knew that then presumably the 

3589
02:25:34,711 --> 02:25:34,930
cancer rates will be going down a lot,
but they haven't really in most cases.

3590
02:25:34,931 --> 02:25:39,931
So it's pretty rare.
You have like a lung cancer situation 

3591
02:25:39,931 --> 02:25:39,931
where smoking obviously causes lung 
cancer.

3592
02:25:40,300 --> 02:25:43,210
Most cancers like breast cancer,
we have no idea why it happens.

3593
02:25:43,490 --> 02:25:45,330
It's also the value itself.
Again,

3594
02:25:45,331 --> 02:25:50,331
anything that happens in the valley,
like when you drive from thousand oaks 

3595
02:25:50,331 --> 02:25:52,390
over the hill and you look down at the 
value like jesus,

3596
02:25:52,391 --> 02:25:53,570
that can't be good.
Yeah,

3597
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:59,300
I hear you.
I've been flying into the valley my 

3598
02:25:59,300 --> 02:25:59,950
entire life and every time you fly into 
the brown gunk that is,

3599
02:25:59,951 --> 02:26:01,270
that is the valley atmosphere.

3600
02:26:01,270 --> 02:26:04,240
You think that's not great mean.
That is one area where obviously we have

3601
02:26:04,241 --> 02:26:09,241
gotten better.
I mean the smog alerts have gone down 

3602
02:26:09,241 --> 02:26:09,241
tremendously in the last 30 years.
Yeah,

3603
02:26:09,241 --> 02:26:09,880
it's gotten a lot better.
It's gotten a lot better.

3604
02:26:10,150 --> 02:26:15,150
And.
But that's also one of the things that 

3605
02:26:15,150 --> 02:26:15,150
Donald Trump is a relaxed.
Some of the,

3606
02:26:15,150 --> 02:26:16,720
uh,
the standards,

3607
02:26:16,890 --> 02:26:19,000
the standard wasn't.
I don't know if he really didn't.

3608
02:26:19,050 --> 02:26:22,300
It wasn't an emission standards.
He changed the car emission standards.

3609
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:24,340
Maybe a,
it's again,

3610
02:26:24,370 --> 02:26:26,320
I wonder how much of the car emission 
standards,

3611
02:26:26,321 --> 02:26:31,321
like there's a,
there's actually a pretty thriving 

3612
02:26:31,321 --> 02:26:33,181
debate in the libertarian community,
particularly about what the standards 

3613
02:26:33,181 --> 02:26:36,511
are,
what drove greater fuel efficiency or 

3614
02:26:36,511 --> 02:26:36,511
whether it was the price of gas that 
drove greater fuel efficiency.

3615
02:26:36,540 --> 02:26:37,750
It has.
The price of gas has,

3616
02:26:37,810 --> 02:26:42,810
has risen and fallen.
You see people change their buying 

3617
02:26:42,810 --> 02:26:42,810
habits,
right?

3618
02:26:42,810 --> 02:26:43,510
In the nineties,
everybody but an suv and then the prices

3619
02:26:43,511 --> 02:26:45,070
went up and everybody would bought a 
prius.

3620
02:26:45,580 --> 02:26:50,580
Well the prius thing is interesting too,
particularly like the tesla thing 

3621
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:53,821
because then you look at the 
environmental disasters of creating 

3622
02:26:53,821 --> 02:26:53,821
these batteries.
Yes.

3623
02:26:53,821 --> 02:26:53,821
And you're like,
whoa,

3624
02:26:53,821 --> 02:26:56,200
this is not totally green.
Yeah.

3625
02:26:56,260 --> 02:27:00,070
Like there's some weird gray area to it.
It's pretty complex.

3626
02:27:00,071 --> 02:27:05,071
And,
and I think that the one thing we know 

3627
02:27:05,071 --> 02:27:07,171
is that there are millions of people all
over the world for all of human history 

3628
02:27:07,171 --> 02:27:10,051
who have been living in absolute penury 
and misery and we now support 7 billion 

3629
02:27:10,051 --> 02:27:12,400
people on the planet and the rate of 
global poverty has dropped by 50 percent

3630
02:27:12,401 --> 02:27:14,620
in the last 30 years.
A lot of that is technological change,

3631
02:27:14,621 --> 02:27:17,890
a lot of that is fossil fuel use and so 
before we,

3632
02:27:18,250 --> 02:27:19,430
you know,
we always have to ban,

3633
02:27:19,480 --> 02:27:21,610
these are two things that are worth 
thinking about balancing like,

3634
02:27:21,650 --> 02:27:26,650
and this is what's again a little 
frustrating is that sometimes you see 

3635
02:27:26,650 --> 02:27:26,650
people on the environmental left who 
will say,

3636
02:27:26,650 --> 02:27:29,420
well this has to be done,
or it's the end of the world.

3637
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:34,440
It's like,
well how about those people in 

3638
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:34,440
developing countries?
How many of those people you're going to

3639
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:34,540
say have to live in poverty in order for
this to happen?

3640
02:27:34,850 --> 02:27:36,310
And then on the right you'll see people 
say,

3641
02:27:36,550 --> 02:27:38,650
well no environmental regulations at 
all,

3642
02:27:38,651 --> 02:27:43,651
just let it all hang out and you know,
sometimes the market hash it out and 

3643
02:27:43,651 --> 02:27:44,950
sometimes the market doesn't hash it 
out.

3644
02:27:44,951 --> 02:27:45,510
And so,
you know,

3645
02:27:45,570 --> 02:27:50,570
I think a little caution is warranted.
I think that's a very reasonable point 

3646
02:27:50,570 --> 02:27:53,911
of view and that's one of the things 
that I really like about your 

3647
02:27:53,911 --> 02:27:54,580
commentary.
I know you're a right leaning guy,

3648
02:27:54,581 --> 02:27:56,230
but you were very reasonable.
You,

3649
02:27:56,231 --> 02:27:58,930
you make argumentS that are sound and 
easy to trace.

3650
02:27:59,130 --> 02:28:01,300
That makes sense.
I think I appreciate it.

3651
02:28:01,450 --> 02:28:03,180
I think we need more of that,
you know,

3652
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:08,230
and I think it's rare that you find that
in a 33 year old guy that's some strange

3653
02:28:08,231 --> 02:28:11,790
sort of conservative character that 
travels around a clown sap.

3654
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:15,940
So the berkeley thing is going to 
happen.

3655
02:28:15,941 --> 02:28:18,310
when is it going to happen?
September 14th is the date it's supposed

3656
02:28:18,311 --> 02:28:21,490
to happen.
So good luck with all that and you know,

3657
02:28:21,590 --> 02:28:22,640
if they cancel it,
we'll still go.

3658
02:28:22,670 --> 02:28:24,710
You got go on a bulletproof popemobile 
yeah.

3659
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:25,440
That,
hey,

3660
02:28:26,290 --> 02:28:27,500
he wears funny hat and said,
oh,

3661
02:28:27,501 --> 02:28:27,790
I said

3662
02:28:30,340 --> 02:28:32,410
yours is a little low profile though.
Yeah,

3663
02:28:32,411 --> 02:28:33,710
we keep,
we keep it on the dl around here.

3664
02:28:33,730 --> 02:28:34,580
What do you,
uh,

3665
02:28:34,610 --> 02:28:39,610
when you,
when you do show up at these places and 

3666
02:28:39,610 --> 02:28:42,761
you see the antifa people and they're 
screaming and yelling and cheering and 

3667
02:28:42,761 --> 02:28:45,770
that's got to be a surreal thing and 
it's just you and your thoughts and your

3668
02:28:45,771 --> 02:28:46,340
opinion.
I mean,

3669
02:28:46,341 --> 02:28:48,190
you're not selling babies.
You're not there.

3670
02:28:48,191 --> 02:28:50,600
Slaughter and dogs and this weekend 
festival.

3671
02:28:50,650 --> 02:28:51,200
Yeah,
exactly.

3672
02:28:51,201 --> 02:28:51,460
Exactly.

3673
02:28:51,470 --> 02:28:52,280
It's weird.
I think that,

3674
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:53,050
uh,
you know,

3675
02:28:53,140 --> 02:28:58,140
I'm not,
I'm not arrogant enough to think that a 

3676
02:28:58,140 --> 02:29:00,821
lot of those people know who I am.
I think that what happens is that 

3677
02:29:00,821 --> 02:29:02,981
there's sort of a call that goes out 
from a select few saying this kkk 

3678
02:29:02,981 --> 02:29:03,890
members coming to campus,
go stop him.

3679
02:29:04,130 --> 02:29:05,870
That's what happened at cal state la.
Like when I spoke there,

3680
02:29:05,871 --> 02:29:10,871
there were actually a couple of 
professors were telling their students 

3681
02:29:10,871 --> 02:29:10,871
that I was a closeted member of the kkk 
anymore.

3682
02:29:10,871 --> 02:29:12,650
Show up wearing a yarmulke.
I'm their favorite person.

3683
02:29:13,250 --> 02:29:14,390
I'm like a charter member.
It's,

3684
02:29:14,391 --> 02:29:19,391
my thing was I was literally in 26.
It was hilarious that year I was 2016 

3685
02:29:20,131 --> 02:29:21,230
was a wild year,
so I was.

3686
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:26,150
So David Duke accused me of being a far 
leftist black lives matter accused me of

3687
02:29:26,151 --> 02:29:29,860
being a member of the kkk and I was the 
number one recipient to the antisemitism

3688
02:29:29,870 --> 02:29:31,760
from the,
according to the anti defamation league.

3689
02:29:31,761 --> 02:29:33,680
I was the number one recipient of 
twitter,

3690
02:29:33,681 --> 02:29:36,050
antisemitism in the United States for 
journalists last year.

3691
02:29:36,051 --> 02:29:38,930
So I do have a little trophy in my 
house.

3692
02:29:38,931 --> 02:29:43,931
It's the most hated jews in America,
which is a hell of a title that green 

3693
02:29:43,931 --> 02:29:43,931
frog.
It is.

3694
02:29:45,290 --> 02:29:47,450
It's a green frog and then a little 
model of a gas chamber.

3695
02:29:47,451 --> 02:29:48,710
It's perfect.
Number one,

3696
02:29:48,850 --> 02:29:50,120
I have by,
by a huge margin,

3697
02:29:50,121 --> 02:29:55,121
by the way,
it was like 40 percent of all 

3698
02:29:55,121 --> 02:29:57,371
antisemitic tweets on the internet 
directly to journalists in 2016 were 

3699
02:29:57,371 --> 02:29:58,760
directed at me personally party.
HOly shit.

3700
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:00,350
It was a good year.
A good year.

3701
02:30:00,380 --> 02:30:05,380
You know,
some years are more productive than 

3702
02:30:05,380 --> 02:30:05,380
others.
What did that feel like?

3703
02:30:05,380 --> 02:30:05,880
Want me to felt like my twitter feed was
just a,

3704
02:30:06,460 --> 02:30:11,460
a dumpster fire.
Anytime I recruited anybody I get 

3705
02:30:11,460 --> 02:30:12,230
somebody,
I get people emailing me,

3706
02:30:12,231 --> 02:30:14,400
please don't retweet me because as soon 
as I recruit someone,

3707
02:30:14,410 --> 02:30:19,410
they just be hit by waves of these 
people died off.

3708
02:30:19,870 --> 02:30:24,870
Yes.
And since the election it's really gone 

3709
02:30:24,870 --> 02:30:24,870
down a fair bit,
but you know,

3710
02:30:24,870 --> 02:30:24,870
uh,
there,

3711
02:30:24,870 --> 02:30:25,360
there were some pretty serious death 
threats.

3712
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:27,110
Like I got people calling my cell phone.

3713
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:28,660
I had to up my security.
I had,

3714
02:30:28,730 --> 02:30:30,620
I already had a shotgun,
but it was,

3715
02:30:30,690 --> 02:30:32,040
uh,
well what,

3716
02:30:32,070 --> 02:30:35,050
what started it off?
probably me quitting breitbart.

3717
02:30:35,210 --> 02:30:35,680
Uh,
so,

3718
02:30:35,700 --> 02:30:37,410
so when I was,
uh,

3719
02:30:37,570 --> 02:30:38,360
you know,
I was not,

3720
02:30:38,361 --> 02:30:43,361
I was not a trump supporter.
I didn't vote for either candidate in 

3721
02:30:43,361 --> 02:30:43,361
this year's election or last year's 
launch support,

3722
02:30:43,361 --> 02:30:43,490
uh,
in the,

3723
02:30:43,491 --> 02:30:45,160
in the primaries,
cruz cruz.

3724
02:30:45,250 --> 02:30:47,070
Um,
I support him in his position.

3725
02:30:47,090 --> 02:30:48,590
He was the closest to me politically.
um,

3726
02:30:48,591 --> 02:30:49,940
so,
you know,

3727
02:30:50,120 --> 02:30:52,460
I was not pro trump during the 
primaries.

3728
02:30:52,910 --> 02:30:55,280
He didn't earn my vote during the 
general election.

3729
02:30:55,281 --> 02:31:00,281
I thought like,
there's two ways to look at your vote 

3730
02:31:00,281 --> 02:31:00,281
and this is what I always said to 
people.

3731
02:31:00,281 --> 02:31:00,281
I said,
vote for who you want to,

3732
02:31:00,281 --> 02:31:01,970
but for me there's two ways to look at 
your vote.

3733
02:31:01,971 --> 02:31:03,470
It's a coupon,
expIres November 9th,

3734
02:31:03,740 --> 02:31:08,740
right?
And so either use it or lose it or it's 

3735
02:31:08,740 --> 02:31:12,490
just,
it says something about what you are 

3736
02:31:12,490 --> 02:31:14,771
willing to accept and it's possible that
there can be election where both 

3737
02:31:14,771 --> 02:31:14,771
candidates suck and you just don't want 
either of them.

3738
02:31:14,771 --> 02:31:16,580
So what did you do during the election?
I voted down ticket.

3739
02:31:16,850 --> 02:31:20,370
I skipped the top of the ticket.
First time I've ever done that.

3740
02:31:20,371 --> 02:31:25,371
so I didn't think either of these people
was qualified to be president of the 

3741
02:31:25,371 --> 02:31:25,371
United States.
Once tRump was elected,

3742
02:31:25,371 --> 02:31:26,070
then it was like,
okay,

3743
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:27,330
if he does good stuff,
I'll praise him.

3744
02:31:27,331 --> 02:31:32,331
And If he does bad stuff I'll,
I'll hit him as I would any other 

3745
02:31:32,331 --> 02:31:34,521
presidents and uh,
so I've been sort of calling balls and 

3746
02:31:34,521 --> 02:31:37,341
strikes with him and some of the stuff 
like gorsuch I love and some of the 

3747
02:31:37,341 --> 02:31:37,341
stuff like makeup brudzinski's bloody 
face.

3748
02:31:37,341 --> 02:31:37,880
I'm not so hot.
I'm so uh,

3749
02:31:37,900 --> 02:31:39,630
that's uh,
but yeah,

3750
02:31:39,631 --> 02:31:40,410
so the,
uh,

3751
02:31:40,411 --> 02:31:41,670
I think what,
what led off was,

3752
02:31:41,671 --> 02:31:42,950
it was a combination of three things.
One,

3753
02:31:42,951 --> 02:31:46,050
I'm jewish too,
and obviously so a two,

3754
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:49,140
I was working at breitbart and then I 
quit in the middle of the election cycle

3755
02:31:49,980 --> 02:31:54,980
after there was that whole,
you remember the Michelle Fields 

3756
02:31:54,980 --> 02:31:56,631
incident where a cory lewandowski 
grabbed the reporter from breitbart or 

3757
02:31:56,631 --> 02:31:56,631
the arm hurt after bruiser.

3758
02:31:56,631 --> 02:31:59,280
And then the actually bruiser bruiser.
I mean he,

3759
02:31:59,320 --> 02:32:00,360
like,
she took pictures,

3760
02:32:00,361 --> 02:32:01,500
she report it to the cops.
It was,

3761
02:32:01,560 --> 02:32:02,730
you know,
unless you,

3762
02:32:02,731 --> 02:32:05,760
unless you believe she bruised herself,
didn't look much like a.

3763
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:10,820
I mean when I watched the videos it 
looked like he just kinda grabbed her 

3764
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:12,960
arm and he looked like he did.
Her body didn't like move,

3765
02:32:12,961 --> 02:32:14,550
like she was being injured.
Yeah,

3766
02:32:14,551 --> 02:32:16,320
I mean she,
lets put it this way,

3767
02:32:16,470 --> 02:32:17,280
she,
that was her account.

3768
02:32:17,281 --> 02:32:22,281
That was also the accounts have been 
terrorist at the Washington post was 

3769
02:32:22,281 --> 02:32:22,281
that she was grabbed hard enough to 
bruise and then she had bruises.

3770
02:32:22,281 --> 02:32:24,180
So you know whAt,
let me as a fight commentator,

3771
02:32:24,181 --> 02:32:29,181
there's a lot of things that I see live 
that look a lot worse than when you 

3772
02:32:29,181 --> 02:32:29,181
watch them on video.
You know,

3773
02:32:29,181 --> 02:32:30,270
when people get knocked out like that 
wasn't much of a punch.

3774
02:32:30,270 --> 02:32:30,780
I'm like,
oh,

3775
02:32:30,781 --> 02:32:34,190
you have to be there.
The example that comes to mind is the,

3776
02:32:34,191 --> 02:32:35,340
the ali listen punch,
right?

3777
02:32:35,341 --> 02:32:36,320
and find number two.
Right?

3778
02:32:36,321 --> 02:32:37,800
So that's probably,
that's probably,

3779
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:43,210
It's probably a bad example.
But bottom line is that the,

3780
02:32:43,290 --> 02:32:44,700
that she.
There were three,

3781
02:32:44,701 --> 02:32:47,250
there were a bunch of different excuses 
that breitbart went through on that.

3782
02:32:47,251 --> 02:32:52,251
One.
One was that she was never grabbed it 

3783
02:32:52,251 --> 02:32:52,251
all and the second was that it was a 
secret service guy.

3784
02:32:52,251 --> 02:32:56,061
And then the third was that,
that from thought she was a security 

3785
02:32:56,061 --> 02:32:59,421
threat and quarterly he had to protect 
trump from this 90 pounds soaking wet 

3786
02:32:59,421 --> 02:32:59,421
girl.
Uh,

3787
02:32:59,421 --> 02:33:02,350
and so once breitbart did that,
then the real question for me,

3788
02:33:02,351 --> 02:33:03,060
it was not,
you know,

3789
02:33:03,450 --> 02:33:04,740
what a horrible thing had happened to 
her.

3790
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:07,800
It was much more about as a journalistic
entity,

3791
02:33:07,801 --> 02:33:10,920
do you stand by your reporters or do you
stand by the candidate who you support?

3792
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:14,680
And once breitbart made clear to me that
it,

3793
02:33:14,690 --> 02:33:15,870
like I already knew they supported 
trump.

3794
02:33:15,871 --> 02:33:20,871
That wasn't any great shock,
but I was kind of their token non trump 

3795
02:33:20,871 --> 02:33:23,601
guy.
And once it became clear that they were 

3796
02:33:23,601 --> 02:33:24,330
willing to sort of sacrifice 
journalistic credibility on the altar of

3797
02:33:24,331 --> 02:33:26,220
getting close to trump,
then I was out.

3798
02:33:26,330 --> 02:33:27,990
And then it's no longer a journalistic 
outlets.

3799
02:33:27,991 --> 02:33:28,890
I quit,
uh,

3800
02:33:28,891 --> 02:33:33,891
and uh,
and that sort of started the ball 

3801
02:33:33,891 --> 02:33:33,891
rolling as far as,
well,

3802
02:33:33,891 --> 02:33:37,080
I really didn't get an isometric 
responses on twitter before that,

3803
02:33:37,160 --> 02:33:38,010
uh,
not too much.

3804
02:33:38,070 --> 02:33:43,070
Not too much.
So I won't say that breitbart directed 

3805
02:33:43,070 --> 02:33:43,070
at amex.
I don't think they did,

3806
02:33:43,070 --> 02:33:43,070
but I think that there are a lot of 
people who,

3807
02:33:43,070 --> 02:33:47,610
who follow breitbart and you know,
milo yiannopoulos and they're pissed at 

3808
02:33:47,610 --> 02:33:52,461
me and I had seen me as like an ally and
now they saw me as an enemy and this 

3809
02:33:52,461 --> 02:33:52,461
kind of thing.

3810
02:33:52,461 --> 02:33:52,880
So,
and then,

3811
02:33:52,900 --> 02:33:54,810
you know,
this is the war for them,

3812
02:33:54,811 --> 02:33:56,010
right?
Oh yeah.

3813
02:33:56,011 --> 02:33:57,390
I mean people enjoyed it.
Obviously.

3814
02:33:57,450 --> 02:34:00,900
That's a weird thing about the online 
hate is how much people enjoy it.

3815
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:02,460
It's anonymous.
You never get.

3816
02:34:02,461 --> 02:34:05,310
You never get tagged for it for now.
That's fine for us for now,

3817
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:10,340
for now.
I mean I've said this to a bunch of 

3818
02:34:10,340 --> 02:34:10,340
college students about,
you know,

3819
02:34:10,340 --> 02:34:10,340
the,
the outright.

3820
02:34:10,340 --> 02:34:14,960
First of all,
I think it's important to mention a lot 

3821
02:34:14,960 --> 02:34:17,151
of people who say they're all right 
aren't actually outright just because 

3822
02:34:17,151 --> 02:34:17,151
you like a meme doesn't make you 
outright,

3823
02:34:17,151 --> 02:34:20,540
but like there's a group of people who 
actually like Richard Spencer and jared 

3824
02:34:20,540 --> 02:34:21,910
taylor and the race based identity 
politics of white supremacy.

3825
02:34:22,320 --> 02:34:24,440
uh,
and those people are actually outright,

3826
02:34:24,670 --> 02:34:26,830
uh,
when the outright is a,

3827
02:34:26,831 --> 02:34:29,740
is coming after you,
then it's not a lot of fun,

3828
02:34:29,741 --> 02:34:30,970
but there,
there are a lot of,

3829
02:34:31,090 --> 02:34:36,090
there are a lot of young students who 
will retweet things from like things 

3830
02:34:36,090 --> 02:34:37,540
that are obviously nasty and are going 
to hurt them in their future career,

3831
02:34:38,060 --> 02:34:38,240
right?

3832
02:34:38,270 --> 02:34:38,760
Where the,
they'll,

3833
02:34:38,790 --> 02:34:43,790
they'll be joking around on facebook and
using the n word and I'll say to them 

3834
02:34:43,790 --> 02:34:43,790
like,
guys,

3835
02:34:43,790 --> 02:34:47,280
you may think it's funny and 10 years 
from now your employer is going to find 

3836
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:51,061
that and you're going to be toast in.
There are a lot of people who start to 

3837
02:34:51,061 --> 02:34:52,810
fall into this idea that what you do 
online is not a mess and it is not,

3838
02:34:52,930 --> 02:34:56,020
it is not going to remain anonymous.
Just a matter of time for a blows.

3839
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:58,440
Yeah,
I mean crap.

3840
02:34:58,480 --> 02:35:01,030
Any anonymity in 10 years.
I agree.

3841
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:06,120
I think that we're,
we're moving in that direction and this 

3842
02:35:06,120 --> 02:35:06,120
is actually a thing that botheRs me in 
general.

3843
02:35:06,120 --> 02:35:08,240
Like did you follow the entry to the 
donald sterling saga here?

3844
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:09,040
Yeah,
sure.

3845
02:35:09,250 --> 02:35:11,800
So it,
it really bothered me that everybody was

3846
02:35:11,801 --> 02:35:15,100
willing to take donald sterling's team 
away from him because you said something

3847
02:35:15,101 --> 02:35:20,101
shitty to his girlfriend about magic 
johnson when there is no evidence that 

3848
02:35:20,101 --> 02:35:21,460
there's actual discrimination among 
clients at the clippers.

3849
02:35:21,461 --> 02:35:26,461
And again,
if tHere were actual evidence of 

3850
02:35:26,461 --> 02:35:28,711
discrimination,
then sure boycott his team and do what 

3851
02:35:28,711 --> 02:35:31,921
the mba has to do.
But like I'm pretty certain that every 

3852
02:35:31,921 --> 02:35:35,371
human beings has crappy things to their 
intimate loved ones about groups of 

3853
02:35:35,371 --> 02:35:36,370
people and other people.
If this now becomes the standard,

3854
02:35:36,371 --> 02:35:37,750
then I think that we're all toast.

3855
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:38,470
Oh,
for sure.

3856
02:35:38,471 --> 02:35:40,660
In his defensive it was like very 
reasonable.

3857
02:35:40,661 --> 02:35:42,040
He's like,
I was trying to get laid.

3858
02:35:42,500 --> 02:35:47,500
Like I was just.
I was just saying he thought he was 

3859
02:35:47,500 --> 02:35:51,151
alone.
He thought he was with her and no one 

3860
02:35:51,151 --> 02:35:54,031
was recording.
I mean she was trying to say that she 

3861
02:35:54,031 --> 02:35:54,031
had recorded all of their conversations,
that it was a part of her,

3862
02:35:54,080 --> 02:35:55,000
her job.

3863
02:35:55,090 --> 02:36:00,090
He's like a senile old guy and he's 
obviously not with vista viano because 

3864
02:36:00,090 --> 02:36:00,090
she's a nobel prize winning physicist.

3865
02:36:00,900 --> 02:36:05,690
Like he bought her a condo and a bentley
and a ferrari and uses his interview.

3866
02:36:05,700 --> 02:36:06,000
His interview

3867
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:11,040
with anderson cooper was one of the 
classic interviews of all time I ever 

3868
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:11,040
saw.
Oh my goodness.

3869
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:14,310
the moment where he says,
because there's a moment where he turns 

3870
02:36:14,310 --> 02:36:14,310
to anderson.
Cooper says,

3871
02:36:14,310 --> 02:36:17,670
henderson,
have you ever fallen in love with a 

3872
02:36:17,670 --> 02:36:17,670
woman,
an anderson cooper who is,

3873
02:36:17,670 --> 02:36:18,330
you know,
super gay.

3874
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:20,370
Fuck yeah.
Single request.

3875
02:36:20,740 --> 02:36:21,550
He starts laughing.
He goes,

3876
02:36:21,551 --> 02:36:22,660
no,
I've never had that experience.

3877
02:36:22,661 --> 02:36:23,290
Well,
henderson,

3878
02:36:23,291 --> 02:36:25,270
when you do fall in love with a woman 
and he just,

3879
02:36:25,340 --> 02:36:27,190
he's so unaware.
It's like,

3880
02:36:27,610 --> 02:36:29,290
I'm sorry,
like I can't consider this guy.

3881
02:36:29,350 --> 02:36:31,620
Like he's a kkk,
threatening figure.

3882
02:36:31,630 --> 02:36:34,150
Like the guy can't even find the toilet 
in the mornings.

3883
02:36:34,151 --> 02:36:35,540
He's stumBling over his autumn.
And like

3884
02:36:35,790 --> 02:36:37,090
I did,
I did about.

3885
02:36:37,091 --> 02:36:42,091
I'm defending him where I was like,
because if you look at what he actually 

3886
02:36:42,091 --> 02:36:42,091
said,
everyone's like,

3887
02:36:42,091 --> 02:36:42,091
he's a racist,
is a terrible person.

3888
02:36:42,091 --> 02:36:44,350
He said,
do me a favor.

3889
02:36:44,351 --> 02:36:46,010
He goes,
I don't.

3890
02:36:46,060 --> 02:36:48,130
He goes,
don't take pictures of black eyes.

3891
02:36:48,131 --> 02:36:49,120
He goes,
in the next sentence,

3892
02:36:49,121 --> 02:36:51,010
he said,
I don't care if you fuck them,

3893
02:36:51,970 --> 02:36:54,280
just don't take pictures of them.
I go,

3894
02:36:55,450 --> 02:36:56,980
in my world,
that's pretty reasonable.

3895
02:36:57,870 --> 02:37:00,340
Like you gotta grow your buying or a 
ferrari.

3896
02:37:00,341 --> 02:37:05,341
All always say,
just don't take any pictures so you 

3897
02:37:05,341 --> 02:37:05,341
could fuck them.
She should just leave well enough alone.

3898
02:37:05,341 --> 02:37:06,610
You're getting a ferrari out of the 
deal.

3899
02:37:06,690 --> 02:37:07,800
No,
I think that was.

3900
02:37:08,250 --> 02:37:13,250
That whole thing was just like it was.
It was our capacity to get ourselves 

3901
02:37:13,250 --> 02:37:16,401
outrage so we could show everybody how 
outraged we work while the president of 

3902
02:37:16,401 --> 02:37:16,401
the nba,
whatever the fuck

3903
02:37:16,401 --> 02:37:18,000
his name is,
what is adam starts now,

3904
02:37:18,020 --> 02:37:23,020
adam silver,
the guy that got on tv and was talking 

3905
02:37:23,020 --> 02:37:23,990
about it like it was the most horrific 
thing that's ever been said by being jim

3906
02:37:23,991 --> 02:37:26,690
crow at at clipper,
at the staples center.

3907
02:37:26,691 --> 02:37:29,090
He shoUld have gotten on tv and said,
look,

3908
02:37:29,180 --> 02:37:30,830
this is obviously.
We know what this was.

3909
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:34,130
This is a gold digger and an old man to 
Stories all the time.

3910
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:36,170
He said some stupid shit.
Old people say,

3911
02:37:36,171 --> 02:37:37,790
stupid shit.
Old guy.

3912
02:37:38,150 --> 02:37:39,440
Here's the thing.
Don't take his advice.

3913
02:37:39,441 --> 02:37:42,620
When it comes to race,
and he probably should have said,

3914
02:37:42,621 --> 02:37:47,621
look,
but on the bright side he told her she 

3915
02:37:47,621 --> 02:37:47,621
can go fuck black guys,
so hey,

3916
02:37:47,621 --> 02:37:49,160
everybody's happy.
What would have been better?

3917
02:37:49,330 --> 02:37:54,330
Presser the ratings with self righteous 
and bullshit and let me know a lot of 

3918
02:37:55,070 --> 02:38:00,070
that again is I think that if you look 
at the nba statistics and who watches 

3919
02:38:00,070 --> 02:38:03,400
the nba,
the outsides number of people who 

3920
02:38:03,400 --> 02:38:05,381
watched the nba are black and they spend
an outsized amount of time watching it 

3921
02:38:05,381 --> 02:38:08,651
and so you know,
donald sterling pissed off a lot of 

3922
02:38:08,651 --> 02:38:10,991
black folks with that,
understandably until a lot of people 

3923
02:38:10,991 --> 02:38:13,091
were like ending the nba was like,
we're not going to lose our fan base 

3924
02:38:13,091 --> 02:38:13,091
over there.

3925
02:38:13,091 --> 02:38:13,091
It was a money decision.
In other words,

3926
02:38:13,091 --> 02:38:14,160
I don't think it was a values decision 
as much as money.

3927
02:38:14,161 --> 02:38:19,161
While I agree with you 100 percent,
but I don't think they had to make that 

3928
02:38:19,161 --> 02:38:19,161
decision that way.
I think it could have been in him.

3929
02:38:19,161 --> 02:38:23,700
They could have been.
It could have divested him and put him 

3930
02:38:23,700 --> 02:38:23,700
like put his kids or his wife in charge 
of the team.

3931
02:38:23,700 --> 02:38:24,830
Like this idea that you're gonna force 
him to sell his team,

3932
02:38:24,950 --> 02:38:29,950
it's going to disband the clippers 
because there was a tape of an old man 

3933
02:38:29,950 --> 02:38:30,920
saying stupid ass things to a gold 
digger is.

3934
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:36,260
It's pretty much so anyway.
And he wound up making more money from 

3935
02:38:36,260 --> 02:38:37,370
that team that he ever would have.
So much more valuable.

3936
02:38:37,371 --> 02:38:38,480
jillion dollars.
Yeah.

3937
02:38:38,540 --> 02:38:41,780
It became much more valuable.
Is the whole thing is bizaRre.

3938
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:44,690
Yeah,
that's it,

3939
02:38:44,691 --> 02:38:45,770
dude.
We just said three hours.

3940
02:38:45,860 --> 02:38:46,630
Well,
that's crazy.

3941
02:38:46,650 --> 02:38:48,290
I appreciate it.
Flew by as great.

3942
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:53,320
Well listen,
people have been asking for a long time 

3943
02:38:53,320 --> 02:38:55,721
for you to come on,
so I'm glad we finally got together and 

3944
02:38:55,721 --> 02:38:55,721
let me do it.
Thanks for having me.

3945
02:38:55,721 --> 02:38:55,721
My pleasure.
Let's do it again.

3946
02:38:55,721 --> 02:38:55,721
Sounds good.
Thank you.
