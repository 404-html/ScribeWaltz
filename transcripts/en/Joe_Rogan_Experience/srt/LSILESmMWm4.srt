1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,380
Two,
one,

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,573
yeah.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,463
Ah,
just a less than a month before 

4
00:00:07,571 --> 00:00:09,250
Armageddon.
And uh,

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,430
we're here in the bunker.
Lovely Woodland Hills,

6
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:13,800
California.
That's right.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,680
Brian motherfucking Kaolin is here.
He is.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,210
He's willing for Jill Stein because she,
like Brian wants 16 year olds to be able

9
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:23,044
to vote,
but we both think it's super rational 

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,063
and a great idea because no one,
no one better to decide the future of 

11
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:34,330
the world.
A hormonally flooded baby.

12
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:36,940
Yeah.
What do you think about the boner?

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,540
What 18 year olds drinking instead of 
21?

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,523
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with someone who is supervised who was 

15
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:47,464
18,
who is sort of mentored into having a 

16
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:55,801
couple of drinks with an intelligent and
very disciplined parental figure.

17
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,950
Like someone who's a smart dad or smart 
mom who says,

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,180
listen,
I don't want you to be.

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,133
I don't want it to be something that's 
so out of reach that you wind up doing 

20
00:01:07,571 --> 00:01:09,730
it and getting obsessed with it because 
it's the forbidden.

21
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:10,870
Dang.
It becomes a big deal.

22
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,540
Yep.
How about a drink or two?

23
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,290
Right.
You know,

24
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,540
but they have to be like a really 
conscientious parent.

25
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:20,080
They should be there with the kid,
make sure no one's driving,

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,280
no stupid shit,
but we all had beers before we were 21.

27
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,280
Everybody did all of us.

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,533
I also think that if you're going to get
people that responsibility to vote and 

29
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:33,020
they can carry the can join the army and
go and fight and die and kings give them

30
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:34,120
a license to kill.
Yes.

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,993
It seems very strange to me that you're 
not also allowed to vote and I mean I'm 

32
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:38,744
sorry,
drink because it used to be in I think 

33
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:42,980
19,
84 is when the law changed.

34
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,770
You were able to drink?
Yeah,

35
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,643
man.
It was like I missed it by just a few 

36
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:49,100
years fuckers.
I didn't.

37
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,410
I don't think I did.
Yeah,

38
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,930
he did because 85.
I was 17,

39
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,960
so that was when I graduated high 
school.

40
00:01:56,961 --> 00:02:00,680
I think I was 18 and 85.
I was drinking in college.

41
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,680
Where are you?
Yeah.

42
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,630
Yeah,
for sure.

43
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,703
I drank in high school,
but I could drink in bars in Washington 

44
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:05,720
DC.
I remember.

45
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,950
Oh really?
There are different laws.

46
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,560
I was 18.
I was an early 18,

47
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,150
January 26th.
I'm so mature now who are mature.

48
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:16,160
I say that about you all the time,
so let's say for a grownup baby,

49
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,890
that's the attitude.
I'm looking the other day at the,

50
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,903
at the comedy store,
and we run down to this other part of 

51
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:27,500
the comedy store and there was a mirror 
and both of us stop.

52
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,740
Look in the mirror and we pull our 
shirts up and start flexing.

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,850
You start going,
oh,

54
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,080
look at my stomach.
Look at my.

55
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,880
Oh my.
Oh,

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,713
leaks as absent,
and then just as quickly through our 

57
00:02:36,651 --> 00:02:41,651
shirts down and ran away as I was going,
I said I just barked were losers.

58
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,260
We're fucking losers.
We're babies,

59
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,183
we're going up babies,
but everybody is until you have so much 

60
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:51,950
responsibility that you're beaten down,
it's no fun anymore.

61
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,063
I didn't.
I think I have figured out the 

62
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:55,190
delineation there.

63
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,320
It's fun to be immature and we are and 
to be silly geese,

64
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,303
but I think the difference is you become
a real adult and you become mature when 

65
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:07,534
you have other people that rely on you 
and where were other people's happiness 

66
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,200
to some degree is more important than 
your own.

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,513
So you know what I mean,
and their development is causes you 

68
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:22,090
concern or angst and requires your time 
and sacrifice.

69
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,953
And if I could throw something in there,
the only way that silly goose stuff 

70
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,710
works at all as if you've got your bases
covered.

71
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,461
That's right,
right?

72
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,410
Like,
it's really tough to be a silly goose if

73
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,244
you're behind on your taxes,
if you have massive credit card debt 

74
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,620
that you're ignoring or there's these 
stacking stress things,

75
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,730
these events,
these,

76
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,564
these,
uh,

77
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,220
factors in your life that can really get
involved in your,

78
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,910
your happiness and your silliness.

79
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,420
So as long as you know your,
your ducks are in a row,

80
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,010
then you can kind of laugh a little bit.
It's stuff.

81
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,960
Well,
we've taken for granted the fact that we

82
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:56,794
have figured out a way to preserve our 
biology and most countries in terms of 

83
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,374
like we have life saving medications or 
sort of preventions for keeping us from 

84
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:11,530
things like malaria and diptheria and 
all those things that used to really.

85
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,513
Because when they.
They always talk about when you go into 

86
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:16,960
a country and you want to get that 
country on its feet and you want to help

87
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:17,794
develop that country,
the first thing you'd have to make sure 

88
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:23,080
of is that people aren't suffering from 
chronic illnesses,

89
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,830
parasites,
diseases that,

90
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,410
that just make them feel shitty.
They've got the right nutrition.

91
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:31,660
So the first thing to do is take care of
your biology,

92
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,620
take care of that.

93
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,930
You know,
that sort of thing that you live in that

94
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:35,764
machine.
Because otherwise if you don't feel 

95
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:38,350
good,
there's a little rudimentary things.

96
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:41,740
If you don't feel good like hookworm in 
the south.

97
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,670
But when after World War,
I mean,

98
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,510
I'm sorry,
civil war was so endemic in getting your

99
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:49,600
feet and was like a,
like a ringworm type thing.

100
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:53,240
Now hookworm gets in your interest or 
your feet because kids would that people

101
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,280
would always use the bat,
they wouldn't use outhouses,

102
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,630
they use the great outdoors and then 
you'd walk around in your bare feet.

103
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,880
So what hookworm does is it gets into 
your,

104
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,793
it guy gets it,
goes through your feet and then it 

105
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:08,350
causes you to become anemic because it 
latches on.

106
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,820
Um,
I don't know.

107
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:12,250
It had to have some mechanism where it 
lapsed on the intestine or something.

108
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,293
Either way.
Huge portions of the south after the 

109
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,130
civil war,
after the civil war were anemic.

110
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:18,963
I mean huge towns.
And in fact it was so bad that they 

111
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,580
started renting,
running campaigns,

112
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,423
saying bought.
Use An outhouse or die was an outhouse 

113
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:28,684
or die and they solved the problem.
But it was a major issue in 

114
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,780
reconstruction after the war.
Major issue in this country in the south

115
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,690
when I lived in Florida,
people used to always talk about worms.

116
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,510
Now that I'm thinking about it,
like this was one of the first times I'm

117
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:43,420
remembering this.
I think one of my aunts got it.

118
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,580
I think she used to walk around barefoot
and Florida is so tropical,

119
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,930
you know,
there's so much.

120
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,510
When we lived there,
we see alligators all the time.

121
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,200
Oh yeah.
Like,

122
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,060
and this was when they were there were 
um,

123
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,410
there were protected.
You ever have worms?

124
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,200
No,

125
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,510
I never got like,
I've gotten ringworm before though.

126
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,280
Yeah,
me too.

127
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,113
But this guy right here that you're 
looking at it as the worms come out of 

128
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:05,900
his ass,
told me this.

129
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:11,290
One of my most vivid memories was my 
sister screaming and crying and I run in

130
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:12,914
and there's a giant pink warm coming 
right out of her four year old ass or 

131
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:16,784
whatever it was.
She didn't know what the fuck was 

132
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,100
happening.
And I was like,

133
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:20,210
I was.
I was like,

134
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,300
it's a worm.
You just have told mom I was a six,

135
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,343
you know,
worried about worms coming out of your 

136
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,160
system.
I was a kid.

137
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:28,994
I,
I'd had him and I was looking to snakes 

138
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,191
and stuff.
I was like,

139
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,470
me,
my mother made it like,

140
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,700
look at you now.
Take this medicine.

141
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,013
Now what happens if you don't have those
warrants or if you don't take the 

142
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:40,500
medication for those worms,
worms,

143
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,270
parasite.

144
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,460
Right?
So how bad can they fuck you up badly.

145
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,620
Look what tapeworm and the worms.
Parasites like worms were a major issue.

146
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:51,104
And if you remember New Guinea worms 
which caused I think elephantiasis to 

147
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,200
diocese.
Um,

148
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,980
but,
but they're awful like New Guinea worms.

149
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,720
Look Up New Guinea worms.
They would,

150
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,720
they would,
I guess if you want to look up something

151
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,554
and look up this video.
That red band was showing me the other 

152
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:08,684
night at the comedy store about some guy
who had an insane amount of worms 

153
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:16,400
removed from his gut that you went to 
the doctor and the complainant's stomach

154
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:18,050
pain that was originally.
Yeah.

155
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,540
Oh Dude.
So there's a video.

156
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,580
Sanitation is such a huge factor in the 
foot there.

157
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,340
Jim,
how dare you,

158
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,690
how dare you,
what I'm talking about?

159
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,700
Sanitation.
Cynical.

160
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,510
Just put it on for us.
So that the uh,

161
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,690
video.
So we don't get pulled.

162
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,071
Yeah,
yeah.

163
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:39,190
We can get a look at it here.
Twenty five year old bodybuilder.

164
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,370
That thing.
Is that it?

165
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,204
Yeah,
I think that's it.

166
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,010
Yeah.
So was there a real thing?

167
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:44,980
But they.
They can be deadly.

168
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,120
Check this out.
They literally have to read.

169
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,430
It says parasitic worms need a high 
deal.

170
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,313
Okay.
This might be like one of those vegan 

171
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:57,680
propaganda videos probably.
I'm looking at all these worms though.

172
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,650
Fucking shit coming out of this guy's 
body.

173
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:02,000
I mean,
it is insane.

174
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,953
His,
his gut is just stuffed with these 

175
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:06,890
squirming worms as he's pulling them 
out.

176
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,920
It's like Spaghetti looks like moving 
spaghetti.

177
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,080
Spaghetti looks like that.
You're not crazy.

178
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:15,370
That I can say look how much it is.
Yeah,

179
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,770
that's discussed.
You're looking literally at a large bowl

180
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:19,604
of spaghetti,
right?

181
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,520
Yeah.
Like I would,

182
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,460
I would be wondering if I could eat that
whole.

183
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,580
That was the reality for a lot of people
over time.

184
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,680
Look at all of that.
That was all inside that dude's body.

185
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:31,090
And take a look at tape worms.
Tapeworms are.

186
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,350
That might be a tape worm that looks 
like a long tapeworm.

187
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:34,963
But um,
do they need animal protein to stay 

188
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,450
alive?
Is that true?

189
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,010
Or could they eat anything to stay 
alive?

190
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,953
Seat.
There you go.

191
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,930
Take it to I.
I don't know if that's true like a.

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,280
let's find out if that's true because if
that is true.

193
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,520
Well first of all,
if you've got bugs and worms,

194
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,520
you got a problem.
Period.

195
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:53,354
Right now it's supposed to get worms and
just because you get sick because you 

196
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,880
get worms and the worms have food to eat
because you eat a certain diet.

197
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,010
It doesn't mean you shouldn't eat that 
certain diet.

198
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,450
You still have a fucking warm living in.

199
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,030
You've still got a warm and loving it.
Yeah.

200
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,930
You got to kill that thing.
Figure out how about those worms,

201
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:10,230
that breakout of your skin and that 
would be a tapeworm massive tape.

202
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:11,064
Worn.
Discovered inside a man who complained 

203
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:12,980
to the stomach.
Yeah.

204
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,260
That's an even different kind of warm.
That other guy had small.

205
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,510
I guess there's a gang of different 
parasites you can get.

206
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,980
You can get it from raw meat.
Look at that,

207
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,350
but that is something to know.
Find out if that's true,

208
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:27,351
because if they can only survive in a 
person that's eating a protein diet or a

209
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,664
high animal protein diet.
I don't know if that's true because 

210
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,890
people got plenty of worms in southern 
India where they were very.

211
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,970
They were vegetarians.
That's,

212
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:36,804
that's nonsense.
The worms were a fact of life for any 

213
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,510
human being.
They're just parasitic date,

214
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:41,970
whatever.

215
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,170
Right.
They can get.

216
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,590
But that said,
if you're consuming animal protein,

217
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:49,320
it's probably another delivery 
mechanism,

218
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,460
right?
Yes.

219
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,670
Food borne,
foodborne worms.

220
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,533
However,
there's also the fact that you grew 

221
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:57,690
your,
your,

222
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,733
your irrigated,
including your vegetables in human shit 

223
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,110
and animal shit.
And you know,

224
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,953
as part of the fertilizer,
when that fertilizer got on a piece of 

225
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,000
lettuce or something that was raw or got
on your hands and you ingest it,

226
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:14,190
that's how you get things like hepatitis
a.

227
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,170
that's how you get other,
uh,

228
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,340
parasites.
Yeah.

229
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:21,930
That's the apparently the biggest form 
of Ecolab poisonings from salads.

230
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,310
That's right.
And that crazy just like,

231
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,180
or was it broccoli or sounds,
but it was a type of Ecolab.

232
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,880
Right?
So it's not just run off,

233
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,360
you know,
that was so ruined.

234
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:36,180
The salt and sea.
You do you know about the salt and sea?

235
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,100
Oh yes,
of course we do.

236
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,490
You mean the one in,
uh,

237
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,280
in Russia?
No,

238
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,500
no.
The salt and seasoned California.

239
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,223
They were calling it the inland Riviera.
California's inland Riviera in the 19 

240
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,950
fifties.
It opened up the Colorado River and they

241
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:56,160
flooded this valley in California.
It's about,

242
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,940
it's outside of Palm Beach.
I'm not sure how far.

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,260
Maybe a couple of hours or something.
I'm not sure it desert though,

244
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,880
but it's in the desert and for a long 
time,

245
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,721
meaning,
you know,

246
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:08,790
a couple of decades.
It was awesome.

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,833
So people partied there.
Sonny Bono and share how to fucking 

248
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:14,970
house there.
They would boat,

249
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,120
they would fish and swim and there was 
all these like beautiful vacation videos

250
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,413
like visit the beautiful Salton Sea,
Californias Inland Riviera greetings 

251
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,374
from the Salton Sea.
So they filled that fucking place up 

252
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:35,430
with water and there was tilapia in 
there and people would boat and all the,

253
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:36,264
like the hip people from the 19 fifties 
they would go to fucking party at the 

254
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,560
Salton Sea.

255
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,980
It was just the spot to be right.
Yeah.

256
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,003
Then the runoff,
the runoff from all the pesticides and 

257
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:53,121
all the farmers use all got in that 
water and the die off is so the fish die

258
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,414
off that the white sands around the 
shores in some spots are actually just 

259
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,510
dead fish bones like that right there.
That is all that guy is standing on dead

260
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,130
fish bones because they're tilapia or 
like particularly hardy,

261
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,323
and they were like one of the only fish 
that can survive in that fucking 

262
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:14,680
polluted cesspool.
Now really it's Sonny Bono.

263
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:15,514
Before he died,
before we went skiing and wacked into a 

264
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:17,944
tree,
his goal was to find some sort of a 

265
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:25,681
desalination and filtration method for 
taking all the runoff and all the,

266
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,480
all the pesticides and bullshit out of 
the salt and sea.

267
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,314
He wanted to try to clean it up.
It was like one of his ideas of what 

268
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:32,180
does that.

269
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,730
You just showed us that before and 
after.

270
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,500
No.
Um,

271
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,400
but it's,
um,

272
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,353
it's an amazing story.
It's an amazing story because they just 

273
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,040
didn't understand what was going on.
What is the,

274
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:45,190
is it the LLC that was a,
the picture.

275
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,080
Yeah,
that's crazy.

276
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:50,380
That was a real legit see that the,
uh,

277
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,670
somehow environmentally we know the 
Russians or whoever was in that area,

278
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,750
it's fucked up.
How did they do that?

279
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,200
Dried it up.
Yeah.

280
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:00,034
I can't remember the reason,
but it had something to do with 

281
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,220
irrigation and farming I think,
and maybe I'm wrong.

282
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,050
When I was in Seattle a couple months 
ago,

283
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,390
uh,
I talked to this gentleman who runs,

284
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,303
um,
there's this like salmon thing down 

285
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:16,170
there where you can go underneath one of
the bridges and actually see the ladders

286
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,004
where the salmon pass through and you 
could see the salmon swimming up the 

287
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:19,180
river.

288
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,770
It's really fucking bad.
Yeah,

289
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:21,604
it's really cool.
Like you go under the river and these 

290
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:25,330
are just wild salmon that are doing 
their thing,

291
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:27,190
but you get to look at them through like
a window.

292
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,473
So they took something that happens 
naturally anyway and they just gave put 

293
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,920
a window so you can go under ground,
check it out.

294
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,810
And then they made it like an awareness 
thing.

295
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,280
They showed the salmon,
we're,

296
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,980
which sort of accounts the fish as they 
go through in some spots.

297
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,363
But this guy was saying that at one 
point in time they had carved a channel 

298
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,220
into this lake and connected this lake 
to the ocean,

299
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,650
and as they were connecting this lake to
the ocean,

300
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:53,600
they fucked up and it drained,
uh,

301
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:54,434
these other waterways.
And so the salmon didn't have a way to 

302
00:13:56,831 --> 00:14:00,850
get back into the lake anymore.
And so they died in mass.

303
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,713
Just millions of salmon just piled up 
and took the path they always take and 

304
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:06,040
just died.
And Rod,

305
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,350
I don't know why she just had this 
toilet,

306
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,710
this image of when you were talking 
about all the salmon that died and,

307
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,510
but they're swimming in one direction.
I,

308
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:16,470
I had this image of all the actors come 
to Los Angeles.

309
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:18,923
I would always feel that way sometimes.
I remember driving and traffic to an 

310
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:24,580
audition or something,
and,

311
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,570
and I would always get this image of 
being a salmon swimming up river.

312
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:30,130
And more importantly,
I didn't know what the.

313
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,100
I wasn't really sure what I was doing it
for.

314
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,690
The guy was like,
I wonder if I'm doing this,

315
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,583
so I can see if I can win at this.
Impossible game or do I really want to 

316
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:39,514
be on set acting like what's really 
going on and what is acting anyway and 

317
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:45,370
why did I get into this in the first 
place and who am I heroes?

318
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,920
Oh yeah,
De Niro and walk in and Chino and.

319
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,933
But then I know what they're really 
doing and do I just want to be in the 

320
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:52,010
movie and

321
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,843
be the guy in the movie or do I really 
want to be an actor and why am I 

322
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:58,580
spending so much time doing Jujitsu and 
other things when I should be working on

323
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:02,600
my acting isn't interesting and if girls
weren't involved with I do it.

324
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,760
All right.
Those are

325
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,590
questions to lot to bring a lot to bring
out.

326
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,443
It's a lot to unbox.
It's hard to kind of get a on something 

327
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,200
important to say.

328
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,910
Mick Westie bunk.
That video,

329
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,350
the warms.
It's not real.

330
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:15,970
It has nothing to do with me.
According to him,

331
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:18,160
there's a video of a three year old with
that many worms too.

332
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,133
Ah,
west is a smart man and mark to this 

333
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,693
debunked that motherfucker,
so that doesn't make sense if it's 

334
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:25,760
coming from a Vegan site.
Those are guys are always here.

335
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,360
Ron saw so added that it's what's shown 
is called a worm Bolis,

336
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,100
but b,
o l u s,

337
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:31,934
he says it's an uncommon complication of
infection and has nothing to do with 

338
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,474
eating lots of meat.

339
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,490
Yeah,
no,

340
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,620
it's an MC west.
He's brilliant.

341
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,783
He.
I met him when I did the Joe Rogan 

342
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:44,274
questions.
Everything show and we were talking 

343
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,490
about chem trails,
which he is worked really hard to try to

344
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,040
explain to people that are ultra 
paranoid.

345
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,930
He calls them the training wheels.
They won't listen.

346
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:56,640
Conspiracy theories now,
they won't.

347
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,150
Won't listen,
but what?

348
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,890
What he had to say and what I saw from 
the people that believe in them.

349
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,773
It's pretty obvious what's going on and 
the problem with everybody freaking out 

350
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:06,294
about these fucking artificial clouds 
that are made naturally by jets as they 

351
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:10,470
passed through the air with the moisture
in the air.

352
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,453
The problem with them freaking out about
that kind of stuff is the government 

353
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:13,884
does do shady shit sometimes,
but you got to be able to differentiate 

354
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:17,304
between what it's actually doing shady 
shit and when it's just a chemical 

355
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:24,891
reaction or just a natural reaction of 
the superheated jet engine hits the cool

356
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:26,880
air and it creates this cloud.
I mean,

357
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:27,960
that's what it is.
They can,

358
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,340
you can,
you can do it right now.

359
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:31,620
You can go do it right now.
It's not hurting anybody,

360
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,571
but I,
I think,

361
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:33,140
uh,

362
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,670
my experience with people who are 
conspiracy theorists is not so much that

363
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:38,504
they're looking for the truth.
I think it's a little bit more and I 

364
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,230
want to be fair,
but I think it's,

365
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,393
I always noticed that they are more 
interested in belonging to a club that 

366
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:50,300
is in the know.
There's an identity attached to it,

367
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,140
so it no longer becomes really about the
search for see if you're,

368
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:55,700
if you're scientifically minded,
right?

369
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:56,990
If you,
if you're somebody who says,

370
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,400
I,
like Michael Shermer says,

371
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,700
I believe in the scientific method.
What that really means is you start with

372
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:02,534
doubt.
Doubt is always present because you're 

373
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:04,994
always trying to prove what your 
assumptions and your assumptions are 

374
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:09,554
usually assumed to be wrong until they 
are proven otherwise through trial and 

375
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:15,554
error,
independent lines of inquiry that come 

376
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:20,120
to the same conclusion.
All things being equal,

377
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,590
you know,
those are the things that we,

378
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,240
that is how we live.
I mean,

379
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:24,270
that's what the,
that was good.

380
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,810
It goes into the medicine,
the computer that you use and everything

381
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:27,470
else.
I mean there's,

382
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,303
there is,
there is a way to get to a result that 

383
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,320
actually has tangible,
mathematical,

384
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:35,680
measurable reality.
Um,

385
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,573
and I think that conspiracy theorists 
are as attached to being a conspiracy 

386
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,830
theorist regardless of what that means 
as they are,

387
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,940
as someone who would be,
I don't know,

388
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,630
it's an identity as opposed to a certain

389
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,451
for truth.
Well,

390
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:55,500
it's also like a default view.
Can't wait to default.

391
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,090
The default view is that it's a 
conspiracy.

392
00:17:58,091 --> 00:18:02,140
The problem with that default view is 
that sometimes it's a conspiracy,

393
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,660
but if you're wrong,
a lot.

394
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,000
And conspiracy theories are wrong a lot 
because they jump too quickly.

395
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,103
They jumped to conclusions too quickly 
instead of actually looking at what the 

396
00:18:13,691 --> 00:18:16,420
fuck the facts are and then going,
okay,

397
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:17,254
well what's fishy about the facts?
All they do is concentrate on what's 

398
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:20,320
fishy.
Right?

399
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,213
That's it.
They did try to narrow in on the one 

400
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:26,350
thing that they think is the most fishy.
I don't remember these jet planes when I

401
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:27,184
was a kid.
I'm like,

402
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,083
bitch,
you don't even remember what call your 

403
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:29,620
house was.
Okay.

404
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,240
You don't remember shit from when you 
were a kid.

405
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,790
Of course you don't remember whether or 
not there with lines behind jets,

406
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:34,624
but there's photos that show lines 
behind Jack Horse and you show them 

407
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:36,960
that.

408
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,170
They get those photos,
man.

409
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,004
Like,
come on,

410
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,083
this is.
I know there's a lot of shady shit the 

411
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:44,830
government has done,
but this one has been tied up.

412
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,500
It's obvious with this.
Here's the problem.

413
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,933
When you pretend that those are clouds 
and that these clouds that are coming 

414
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:52,834
out of the back of these jets are some 
sort of a chemical spray that the 

415
00:18:55,601 --> 00:19:00,310
government is launching indiscriminately
down on on civilization for mind control

416
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:01,144
or some nefarious purpose.
So whatever fucking nefarious purpose 

417
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:07,570
that believe it's the worst,
it's the most obvious government program

418
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:11,950
ever because it's so ineffective.
Jack Shit like they.

419
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,530
It hasn't done anything.
People are living longer than ever.

420
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,693
Diseases are getting cured,
whether there they're more rebellious 

421
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:18,034
than ever.
Everyone was for Bill Murray shirt on 

422
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,423
and people would.
If Bill Murray was running for fucking 

423
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,730
president right now,
people will vote.

424
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,810
They would vote for him.

425
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,673
Really awesome about the Internet and 
about all of this is that I think like 

426
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,843
all you hear lately and I agree,
is that the mainstream media is not 

427
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:37,670
really a reliable source of truth 
anymore.

428
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:39,410
They're not objective.
They're just not objective.

429
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:39,920
Look,
I don't,

430
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,270
I don't.
I don't like trump,

431
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:44,660
but I will admit that the New York 
liberal media,

432
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:47,240
who I rarely agree with anyway has been,
has given him.

433
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:49,950
I'll fucking.
I mean he's not as.

434
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,023
He's his own worst enemy of course,
but there's no question that a lot of 

435
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:58,691
it's either bought off or it's or it's 
or influenced by by its owners because.

436
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:02,450
And influenced by the fact that it has 
to be entertaining.

437
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,720
It can be for ratings,
but it's also not objective.

438
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,663
When I was watching Hannity on Fox News,
he wouldn't even let this woman get her 

439
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:14,780
point of view out about Hillary and he 
wouldn't.

440
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,240
He just kept interrupting.
So you know,

441
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,490
it's not about a discussion.
It's about pushing an agenda.

442
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,383
Exactly,
and I think what's what's to happen and 

443
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:22,544
what has happened is you have things 
like viceland and different independent 

444
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,840
movements that are saying,
you know what,

445
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,900
let's get integrity back into journalism
because it's very needed and let's,

446
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,680
let's get out there and get real stories
that are going to take guts and let's do

447
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:40,514
some real investigative journaling.
I think they'll always be a marketplace 

448
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,900
for that.
We want to know the truth.

449
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,040
We want the truth.
You're not going to have a full.

450
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,850
I know that Fox News

451
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,810
and CNN are give a lot of news to a lot 
of people,

452
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:53,644
but I think as they continue to 
discredit themselves with certain 

453
00:20:57,101 --> 00:20:57,934
behaviors,
people are going to be looking for more 

454
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:00,311
advice.
Well,

455
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:01,144
they can't.
They can't fall back on that anymore 

456
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,490
because they're the purveyors of truth.
You are the only ones here,

457
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:09,400
the only world purveyors of truth,
CNN,

458
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,930
Fox News,
NBC,

459
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:12,130
ABC,
CBS,

460
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:12,964
the big ones,
everybody that's putting out these 

461
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:17,380
gigantic shows that are being viewed by 
millions of people.

462
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,290
There's a small handful of you and if 
you're full of shit,

463
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,420
it's a giant problem,
so if you're full of shit,

464
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:24,460
it doesn't matter.
All the good stuff that you do,

465
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,650
it doesn't really matter because you're 
fucking us.

466
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,783
And I watched Fox News,
I watch CNN the other day and I'm going 

467
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:31,174
back and forth between the two of them 
and I would just watch one for now and 

468
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,150
then watch what the other for now.

469
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,470
One of them just wants to talk about 
nothing but sexual assault and they were

470
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:41,290
talking about how important it is that 
we.

471
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,143
We don't use certain language in the 
workplace and Don Lemon was telling 

472
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:45,994
people's,
I've had Czech people have my personal 

473
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:50,440
life and that amazing.
Just talking about gender,

474
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:52,510
it's about sexual assault,
but look,

475
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,940
the sexual assault allegations and 
everything,

476
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,200
they're all serious,
right?

477
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:57,034
You don't want a guy who's a sexual 
assault attacker who is in the White 

478
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,751
House.
You don't want that,

479
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:02,590
nobody wants that.
Right.

480
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:03,843
But it's also important that you look at
all the fucking corruption that's been 

481
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,340
shown about the Democratic Party,
but what they did to keep Bernie sanders

482
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:14,980
out the way they conspired.
Well,

483
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:17,740
Hillary Clinton and the Clinton 
Foundation,

484
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:18,574
I mean there's the list of grievances 
and corruption has been well documented 

485
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:23,614
as a mile long.
It's almost like if I was Hillary 

486
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,570
Clinton and I knew that I like,
there's a lot of dirt on me.

487
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,403
Like God damn,
I did some shady shit and now the 

488
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:35,611
internet starting to expose my financial
dealings and these $250,000

489
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,680
speeches that she get to,
you know what?

490
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:42,250
I would wait to run against someone who 
is so fucking terrible.

491
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:47,550
Someone's a horrible person and just 
like maybe I could get donald to like do

492
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:49,420
me a solid.
And Donald's like,

493
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,410
oh,
I'll play it up.

494
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,500
Big Pussy grab and I'll say a bunch of 
crazy.

495
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:58,270
She will leak some tapes.
It's not that far fetched almost.

496
00:22:58,271 --> 00:22:59,490
You know,
talk about a conspiracy.

497
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,400
It was a Democrat,
you know that right?

498
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,670
Donald trump used to be,
I believe that's.

499
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,533
Well,
I don't think Donald trump was anything 

500
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:06,760
but Donald Trump.
Ian,

501
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,653
I mean I.
I don't think that Donald Trump has an 

502
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:12,820
ideology or philosophy because that 
would require.

503
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,050
Oh,
he does.

504
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:14,884
He has an ideology and philosophy in 
terms of what he can see in what he has 

505
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,980
experienced and felt,
but if you're,

506
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,863
if you think Donald Trump actually has a
philosophy and an ideology that was 

507
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:27,064
based on him sort of really thinking and
reading and take and stepping outside 

508
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:31,930
himself,
reaching beyond himself,

509
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,360
you're out of your mind.
That's my problem with Donald Trump.

510
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,180
That's my problem.
Go to Morgan Murphys,

511
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:41,080
instagram page and pulled pork and 
Murphy put this thing up today.

512
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,973
She's hilarious.
She put this thing up today about a 

513
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,120
Donald Trump debating a scientist.

514
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,330
Put this up.
Oh,

515
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,500
it's,
it's.

516
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,980
He's just such a character like there's 
never been a character like this running

517
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:00,140
for president.
I'm so torn like,

518
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:02,420
watch this.
Go fullscreen and press press place that

519
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,254
we get here.

520
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,433
Philosophy,
Maxwell's equations together in the 

521
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:13,244
right way.
You'll get the velocity of waves moving 

522
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:16,840
down in actual.

523
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,343
That's actually genius,
but here's he'll look at his facial 

524
00:24:23,581 --> 00:24:24,750
expressions.
He,

525
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,613
this is why I've started feeling like 
life is fiction because his facial 

526
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:33,940
expressions are literally what you would
see in a Dr Seuss book.

527
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,130
Like,
look,

528
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,590
he pulls his Chin in tight.
Look at that.

529
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,320
I don't mind any of that.
I actually find him.

530
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,750
I see all of that stuff that people talk
about.

531
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,033
Um,
I think to me is so a of minimal 

532
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:49,830
importance.
Believe it or not,

533
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,873
there's so much of what he does is 
actually entertaining and stuff like 

534
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:53,080
that.
He talks,

535
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,570
he teases.
He's insulting.

536
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,550
If the guy was really up on issues,
if the guy,

537
00:24:59,551 --> 00:25:00,990
if there was every,
any evidence,

538
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:03,180
he took advice,
just taking advice.

539
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:04,014
He can't take advice.
He didn't even prepare for the debates 

540
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:07,590
at all.
You could see it.

541
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,490
He's just so off the cuff and I'll be 
honest with you,

542
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,050
I'll be honest.

543
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:13,883
I'll be honest with you.
I think there's cheating going on and 

544
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,490
she's broken and I'll collaborate.
Posey,

545
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,593
he's.
Someone needs to explain to him economy 

546
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,930
of words.
It's super important,

547
00:25:24,931 --> 00:25:25,764
but he doesn't know because he could get
to a position of like being a leader 

548
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:30,180
like she like.
She's really good at that.

549
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,870
Her economy of words is excellent.
That's how her brain is organized.

550
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,900
His brain is not organized that way.
His brain is organized to be impulsive,

551
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:42,660
to be reactive.
If you to draw a picture of his brain,

552
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:44,650
like a side view of his brain?
Yeah.

553
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,013
How,
what percentage of it would just say 

554
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:51,540
grab the pussy inside if you had to 
break it up like wisdom health.

555
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:52,800
Like what?
What he's thinking about.

556
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,420
I think that the grab the pussy would be
much smaller than the part of the.

557
00:25:57,421 --> 00:26:00,240
Brandon just said me,
you know,

558
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,410
that's my aunt.

559
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,460
She was a Democrat from 2001 to 2008,
2008.

560
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,930
He gave to John Mccain for president.
He gave to Hillary Clinton's campaign,

561
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,600
but then he was also as a real estate 
developer.

562
00:26:12,601 --> 00:26:13,434
He was very.
He was.

563
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,453
He gave to whatever political party was 
going to get him the tax breaks he 

564
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:19,530
needed or give them the favors.
He needed that.

565
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:20,364
That's really what you do.
I was secretly hoping that he was doing 

566
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:27,810
all this asshole stuff running to get 
the Republican nomination.

567
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:29,730
Then once you've got the Republican 
nomination,

568
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,040
he would just completely.
I Quito,

569
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:35,340
the whole thing and Intel,
you know,

570
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:35,970
Hillary,
look,

571
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,803
I'm,
I'm going to be as reasonable and 

572
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:38,994
rational as possible and I don't want to
insult you and I don't want to pretend 

573
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,220
that things are any worse

574
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,053
than they really are,
but I believe that you're part of a 

575
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:47,094
systemically corrupt system and I wanted
to just get to this position so that I 

576
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,760
once now I'm here now I can just tell 
you how I really feel,

577
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,540
but I feel like the system is broken.
It is and it's crazy.

578
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,403
It's crazy that we stick to it because 
we could definitely come up with a 

579
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:02,400
better one,
but we stick to it because it's old.

580
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,180
Well also though,
I,

581
00:27:05,181 --> 00:27:06,240
I see,
I don't begrudge,

582
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:09,000
I don't like when people insult trump 
voters and I'll tell you why.

583
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,893
I think there are a lot of trump voters.
I might be ignorant or not interested 

584
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:12,420
in,
you know,

585
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,040
but I always,
I think it's unfair.

586
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,203
I think it's unfair to categorize 
somebody who wants to vote for trump or 

587
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,533
not vote for hillary.
I think it's very unfair and 

588
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:24,450
condescending to consider them to be a 
DM or a rednecks.

589
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,463
I think the problem with that is this,
Hilary Clinton is talking in very much 

590
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:29,694
the same way and along the same 
parallels that Obama did eight years 

591
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:37,260
ago.
If you are a working class dude,

592
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,573
if you are somebody who has been left 
behind through globalization and 

593
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:44,664
through,
I guess just how the country is moving 

594
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:48,390
technology,
so if you're a coal miner,

595
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,070
if you're A.
I don't know,

596
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:50,904
there are a lot of industries.
You are listening to this woman speak 

597
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:58,120
exactly the way Obama did eight years 
ago and your life has gotten worse.

598
00:27:58,121 --> 00:27:59,280
It hasn't gotten better.
It's gotten worse.

599
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,563
Why in the world would you not?
Why in the world would out of 

600
00:28:03,211 --> 00:28:07,770
desperation would you not try this very 
entertaining,

601
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,440
oh,
giant white guy who's,

602
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,333
who's got confidence,
who wants to break Washington apart and 

603
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:17,370
who saying,
I'm going to make Washington.

604
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,330
I mean America Great.

605
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,780
Again,
it that that appeals to our emotions and

606
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:22,710
I don't think,
and I,

607
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:23,544
I do a lot of reading and stuff.
I don't think I would necessarily be 

608
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:26,724
that different if I,
if I didn't know what else you take 

609
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:30,840
acting and stand up away from me or 
whatever.

610
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,400
What am I going to do?
Teach.

611
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,900
I don't know what I do.
Either way.

612
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:36,300
I would be pretty.
I'd be pretty desperate for a change and

613
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:37,134
I wouldn't be voting for Hillary,
but don't you think there's a giant 

614
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,473
issue in,
in deciding that you're going to vote 

615
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:47,160
for someone who says they're going to go
after someone and lock them in jail.

616
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,023
That's what a dictator done.
A set set of special prosecutor on her 

617
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:53,460
and how?
Because if I was president,

618
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:55,740
you'd be in jail like she's,
she's,

619
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:58,750
but that's how it dictating him.
How a dictator dictator.

620
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,110
What do they always do?
When dictators coming to power,

621
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,450
their opposition gets locked up or 
killed.

622
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,313
You can correct me if I'm wrong.
There's the president doesn't have the 

623
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:10,440
power to do that.
You have the power to start some special

624
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:12,330
investigation on her.
The answer,

625
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:13,164
the short answer is yes.
The president can appoint an attorney 

626
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,760
general,
uh,

627
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:18,594
uh,
from the Justice Department is on 

628
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:20,550
attorney general,
I believe,

629
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,540
to investigate,
uh,

630
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,670
the,
uh,

631
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,080
special case.
Okay.

632
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,000
He could technically do that.
Wow.

633
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,870
That's not seem fucked.
You can.

634
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,620
She could do that to him too,
by the way.

635
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:32,050
Right.
It's,

636
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,790
it's much deeper than that because 
Donald Trump will say things like this.

637
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,720
I,
I,

638
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,950
if I told the generals what to do,
they would do it.

639
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,200
And I've always said we go in and take 
the oyster.

640
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,093
You're paraphrasing.
I'm not phrasing that he actually said 

641
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:42,911
that.
He said,

642
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:44,380
if I,
if I told them what to do,

643
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:44,760
they do it.

644
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,350
In other words,
hey,

645
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,310
I,
I know how to run the military.

646
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,480
Unlike these people he's had and our 
general failed five deferments.

647
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,343
Well,
this is what I'm saying is that as a 

648
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:57,130
dictator,
if he was in charge,

649
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,760
he didn't even know how that works,
but he really said that is what my point

650
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:01,600
is.
Yes.

651
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,320
He said many things like that.
He's such a,

652
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,880
he's such an obvious Megalomania may 
megalomaniac such an obvious demagogue.

653
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,270
And,
and I don't,

654
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,070
and you're talking to a guy,
I don't like Hillary at all.

655
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:17,320
I think she's,
I think she's more of the same.

656
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:19,210
Yes.
But I think she's a corrupt human being.

657
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,090
There are a lot of examples of that.
However,

658
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:24,610
I'm not as uncharitable to say that I 
think she's,

659
00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:27,190
I don't think she's evil.
I think she has a vision for the world.

660
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,570
I think she wished she,
in her mind,

661
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:30,970
she believes she knows what's best for 
the country,

662
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,193
but there's a difference because I think
she's willing to take big shortcuts to 

663
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:36,370
gain influence and always has in her 
career.

664
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,650
And uh,
and like what,

665
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,390
like what kind of big,
using influence,

666
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:43,180
using political influence to get what 
she wants when,

667
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:43,901
when,
I mean,

668
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:47,080
if you look at the people that Clinton 
pardoned,

669
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,273
I mean,
that part of scandal was the craziest 

670
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:51,460
thing in the world would be.
Pardon Frank?

671
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:52,990
Rich,
take a look at the list.

672
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,160
Frank,
rich,

673
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,993
uh,
the,

674
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,710
the,
he,

675
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,543
he,
Hillary wanted to run for Senate in New 

676
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,340
York and he needed certain counties and 
he needed a large,

677
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,900
I believe,
Hasidic Jewish vote and he pardoned some

678
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,720
guy in a rabbi or somebody in there that
it was such a blur.

679
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,780
It literally,
I remember the democratic,

680
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,420
someone I think maybe was one of the 
democratic pundents who said,

681
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:21,310
I don't know how you defend this.
It's just so obvious that he's trying to

682
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:23,980
buy his wife votes that he's trying to 
buy influence.

683
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:26,020
And that was,
that's well documented.

684
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,000
I don't think a lot of Democrats would 
disagree with that.

685
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,140
You know,
look it up.

686
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,950
Look up the uranium one deal.
That's just what they did.

687
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,600
One deal.
Who through Bill Clinton's influence,

688
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,630
this Canadian businessman bought the 
cars like oil,

689
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,530
a uranium fields.
Well,

690
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,920
let's go one scandal at a time.
The first one,

691
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,650
did you find the first one?
Yeah.

692
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,340
The guy's name.
Mark richens Scott up before.

693
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,640
I think he was going to go down as like 
the at the time,

694
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,360
largest tax evasion.
Oh,

695
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:54,170
that's right.
Time living in Switzerland.

696
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,090
He was prosecuting things right here in 
the middle.

697
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,620
Yeah.
Hm.

698
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,453
Future.
He was a fugitive who fled to us during 

699
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:06,250
his prosecution,
was residing in Switzerland.

700
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:10,420
He had $48,000,000
in taxes and was charged with 51 cases.

701
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,420
Accounts of tax was pardoned for tax 
evasion.

702
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,033
He was required to pay a $1,000,000
fine and waive any use of the pardon as 

703
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:19,594
a defense against any future civil 
charges that were filed against him in 

704
00:32:21,871 --> 00:32:22,900
the same case.

705
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:23,883
Whoa.
Critics complained that Denise 

706
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,650
Eisenberg,
rich,

707
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,483
his former wife,
had made substantial donations to the 

708
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:34,780
Clinton library and Mrs Clinton's Senate
campaign.

709
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,823
What a surprise that Marc Rich,
who lives in Switzerland and you're 

710
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:40,970
going to give him a pardon?
Do you think they're connected?

711
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,280
It was so blatant.
It was ridiculous,

712
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,370
but you can keep going with the pardons.
There are a lot of examples of that.

713
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,200
So to call Hillary Clinton,
not corrupt the uranium one deal.

714
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,160
God,
look that up.

715
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,240
What's that?
What's uranium?

716
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:54,021
Well,
well,

717
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:54,800
uh,
the,

718
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,050
uh,
Canadian businessman bought the Kazak in

719
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,770
Pakistan,
used to be a part of the Soviet Union,

720
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,910
a uranium fields.
Uh,

721
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,900
some of the,
some huge uranium fields,

722
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,520
I think some of the biggest in the 
world,

723
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,790
uranium which you use to make nuclear 
weapons,

724
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,653
oh shit.
And Bill Clinton helped him with his 

725
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:16,760
influence,
a well documented influence,

726
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,660
help this Canadian businessman by those 
uranium fields.

727
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,523
But here's the problem,
that Canadian businessman gave 

728
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:24,434
$31,000,000
to the Clinton Foundation with a pledge 

729
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:31,640
for 100 million more and he gave Clinton
a $500,000

730
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:37,930
check for speaking for a speech and then
$500,000.

731
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,140
Then when it came time for the Clinton,
for,

732
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,993
for the cars,
like oil fields to be sold to a Russian 

733
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:46,994
company,
a Russian company that the State 

734
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,620
Department and everybody else in our 
intelligence,

735
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,670
he said,
our guys,

736
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,740
the Soviets are going to have a lot of 
access to uranium,

737
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,110
some of the biggest reserves in the 
world.

738
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,840
And this Canadian business has been sell
to a Russian company.

739
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,013
Um,
Hillary Clinton was secretary of state 

740
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,180
at the time and she okayed that deal.
She was one of the people that had,

741
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,250
that had to give her.
Okay.

742
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:12,230
So now the Russians own a lot of that,
although those oil fields.

743
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,093
Oh,
and by the way,

744
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,383
look up the Russian,
the US Russian technology initiative 

745
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,950
where we're.

746
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:19,783
One of the,
one of the movements is to have Russian 

747
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,650
citizens in Russian.
I'm American citizens,

748
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:25,484
share technology,
share technology and technological sort 

749
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:29,660
of ideas and stuff.
Um,

750
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,690
the problem with that is that,
that requires American investors.

751
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,990
Twenty eight of them were chosen,
were chosen.

752
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,820
Sixty percent were 60.
Oh,

753
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,713
I'm sorry.
And Hillary Clinton as secretary of 

754
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:43,010
state was,
was spearheading that.

755
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:48,610
Of the 28 us partners that invested 60 
percent gave to the Clinton Foundation.

756
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,100
Now come on now,
come on.

757
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,060
This is blatant stuff.
So we have to look at that.

758
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,700
You can't quit.
Great picture.

759
00:34:58,701 --> 00:35:01,850
They got over it.
Could she look more guilty?

760
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,893
The report Russian government initiative
gave millions of dollars to Clinton 

761
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,663
Foundation.
And what does that on while Clinton was 

762
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:11,090
serving as secretary of state?
You don't think she knew that?

763
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,190
What's the website?
That's one freebie.

764
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,940
Kay was in the Wall Street Journal.
It's been well documented.

765
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,640
This is not.
This is not a conspiracy stuff.

766
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:20,474
This is every major publication in the 
world would knows this and concur is 

767
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:26,930
along the same lines,
the same story.

768
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,010
It's the same story.
They could,

769
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:28,844
they could print the same story.
It's not just what do they do with the 

770
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:31,814
money?
Like what is the challenge here is the 

771
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,740
money because here's the question that 
she just recently got some crazy award.

772
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,073
Uh,
the

773
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:38,963
charity,
the Clinton Foundation received some 

774
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,440
highest accreditation or it's a very 
good car.

775
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,360
It's a very good question.
First of all,

776
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:48,480
be careful of those explanations.
Foundations have always been notoriously

777
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:52,380
corrupt and in every aspect including 
getting high ratings,

778
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,243
but,
but there is no doubt that the Clinton 

779
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,983
Foundation does a lot of good for 
children with AIDS overseas for I think 

780
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:04,140
things like malaria,
malaria nets,

781
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,323
they,
I think they even work maybe with the 

782
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,270
gates foundation.
They do a lot of good stuff now.

783
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,420
There are a lot of reporters have 
written about how it's a slush fund,

784
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,403
how it's used for other things.
I don't know anything about that and I 

785
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:17,574
don't begrudge explained slush fund.
How would that mean they would take the 

786
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:24,190
money from there and use it for their 
own updates?

787
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,230
Flush look up slush fund.
I can give you.

788
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,210
I can give you a definition,
but for the most part it's.

789
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,043
I'm a slush fund typically would be a 
place to put money that under the under 

790
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:39,090
certain offices has said for this,
but it's actually used for other things.

791
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:42,360
A reserve of money used for illicit 
purposes.

792
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,730
Especially political bribery.
Yes,

793
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,980
but you say,
but what you say is,

794
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,340
Oh,
this money is for,

795
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,290
you know,
curing this disease.

796
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,124
But it's used for other things.
So I asked him that might be unfair to 

797
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:57,480
say that the Clinton Foundation's is 
less fun.

798
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:58,314
That's what journalists,
especially from conservative newspapers 

799
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,120
like Wall Street Journal will say.
Of course.

800
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,710
Yeah,
of course they're going to do that.

801
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:05,544
I mean,
what I was going to say earlier about 

802
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,180
Tony back and forth between CNN and Fox 
News,

803
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,420
it was one of the best examples I've 
ever seen of the fact that they.

804
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,860
These guys are playing a game and this 
is just the propaganda news network.

805
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:17,694
Now this is a propaganda news network 
for the left and his propaganda news 

806
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:23,430
network for the right and they're both 
guilty guilty of both guilty.

807
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,293
No one's being honest about her.
No one's having this conversation that 

808
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:28,410
we're having where we're saying,
look,

809
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:31,980
maybe wouldn't be the worst idea in the 
world to get someone in there who's some

810
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:36,090
crazy rich guy who's this gigantic 
figure that'll stir things up.

811
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:41,390
Like maybe like having a guy like him 
would be a doorway to having someone who

812
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,283
has like some next level view of running
government and including people in the 

813
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:51,060
process and,
and moving it away from this.

814
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,213
This,
the system is too restrictive and it's 

815
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:56,370
too restrictive based on the times in 
which it was creative.

816
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:00,690
The representative government model that
they needed in 1776.

817
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:05,430
It's a very different world today.
It's 2016.

818
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,890
I don't know.
I think that that the bigger culprit may

819
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,970
be less systemic like you're talking 
about.

820
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,103
I actually think the bigger culprit is 
the wrong ideas are starting to win the 

821
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:17,310
day.
And here's what I mean.

822
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,840
Um,
if you,

823
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:21,480
let's just take the left.
Let's just take the hysterical left.

824
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,850
Uh,
and I think by the way,

825
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:24,684
I'm,
I'm more of a libertarian so that maybe 

826
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,350
would make me maybe more swing.
We're both pretty left a lot of stuff.

827
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,213
Exactly.
I was about to say it was about to 

828
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,190
categorize it.
That's the problem is these categories,

829
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:35,980
categories are

830
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,813
fucking stupid to.
It's super left on almost every social 

831
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:42,094
issue on welfare,
on government programs to help 

832
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:50,260
communities and boys clubs and girls 
clubs and things along those lines.

833
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,370
You're making my point for me.
Exactly.

834
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,204
So when I say left,
what do I really mean when I say I'm a 

835
00:38:55,671 --> 00:38:57,320
libertarian?
What do I mean by that?

836
00:38:57,321 --> 00:38:59,030
Because I'm not a total libertarian.
Right?

837
00:38:59,031 --> 00:39:01,370
So here's a better way is exactly what 
I'm trying to say.

838
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,383
Here's a much better way of establishing
sort of where you stand and rather than 

839
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:09,434
say,
these people over here are wrong and 

840
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:12,110
these people over here,
right?

841
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,010
Or these people are left to right.
What you're doing is categorizing people

842
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:17,840
and we know that people are all over the
place.

843
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:21,020
Look at you and I left this way.
I'm socially very liberal.

844
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,080
I believe in fair play.
I also believe in common sense.

845
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:26,120
I also believe in personal 
responsibility.

846
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,370
That's where it gets weird.
You start moving right?

847
00:39:28,371 --> 00:39:29,151
Isn't that interesting?
Well,

848
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:30,500
that's what happens,
but that's called.

849
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:35,620
That's called being occupying the entire
intellectual and emotional spectrum as a

850
00:39:36,861 --> 00:39:37,400
human being.

851
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,233
What a surprise.
I'm a sinner and I'm a St Motherfucker 

852
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,280
and a lot of times I'm in the joker,
joker,

853
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,160
and a smoker as well.
Come on,

854
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,300
midnight Toker.
Sometimes they don't want to run.

855
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,040
Fuck no,
I stand.

856
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:52,580
I.
I set my heels and I fucking Dr Steve.

857
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:54,080
Man,
I bought my own fucking tongue.

858
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,430
Whoa easy.
But here's the.

859
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,480
Here's the.
Here's a better way.

860
00:39:56,481 --> 00:39:57,500
Here's,
here's the enemy,

861
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,910
not a person.
Here's the enemy.

862
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,080
It's this at one example.
It's this thought process.

863
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,750
We have a disenfranchised group over 
here.

864
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,680
Let's call them transsexuals or let's 
call them black people,

865
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,693
or let's call them women.
I can't believe you lumped all those 

866
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,020
three people.
Well,

867
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:16,430
we do this with.
Let's just take.

868
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:17,264
Let's take.
Let's take the fact that women are 

869
00:40:18,741 --> 00:40:20,740
victims of sexual assault.
All right.

870
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,990
We've.
We've established that sexual assault is

871
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,250
first.
Let's define what it is,

872
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:27,100
but we know that for the most part it's 
a problem.

873
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,760
It's a terrible thing when it happens,
right?

874
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,950
I'm talking about rape now.
Um,

875
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,670
there's,
there's a,

876
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,603
we know we want to solve that or make it
better or make women safer and make the 

877
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:41,480
world safer.
I think what happens is a lot of times,

878
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,700
one group that one thought process in 
solving that problem is as follows,

879
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,980
well,
let's find out who's doing the raping.

880
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,600
It's mad.
It's mad.

881
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:51,943
Um,
so what we're going to do is make it 

882
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:57,350
better because we are going the way 
we're going to make a bit as we're going

883
00:40:57,351 --> 00:41:02,351
to take the power away from those men 
and we're gonna get somewhere else.

884
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:04,580
And how are we going to do that?
Well,

885
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:06,170
there's only one way to do it.
You need a,

886
00:41:06,171 --> 00:41:07,970
you need a big,
big,

887
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,200
powerful authority to actually be able 
to enforce that.

888
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,010
You need laws and you need regulations 
and union restrictions.

889
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:20,690
So the idea that by you will make 
someone else who's not powerful,

890
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:25,750
more powerful by putting down people 
that are already powerful by taking that

891
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:27,314
power away from them financially or with
laws as if that is going to make the 

892
00:41:33,111 --> 00:41:37,610
people who have been oppressed as it's 
going to make their lives better.

893
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,470
I think that's a faulty way of thinking.
I don't think that empowers women.

894
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,570
I don't think that empowers black 
people.

895
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:45,404
I don't.
I think rather personal responsibility 

896
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:54,130
and making it so that that group can 
figure out how to empower themselves and

897
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:57,680
the way you empower yourself is not by 
taking power from somebody else.

898
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,590
I mean unless they were there,
you know,

899
00:41:59,591 --> 00:42:02,480
a sadist and keeping you in a cage.
But for the most part,

900
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,250
I think that's a very important 
distinction and discussion to have.

901
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,860
That's the discussion.
That's the debate.

902
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,500
I'd love to hear between CNN,
Fox,

903
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,080
but I don't.
Well,

904
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,320
I also think there's a big problem with 
this right?

905
00:42:16,321 --> 00:42:17,154
And left system in the.
You pick a side and you want that side 

906
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:22,380
to win and it's,
it's,

907
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,660
it's almost like a civil war in America 
every time.

908
00:42:24,661 --> 00:42:27,870
The [inaudible] elections come up and I 
think it's bogus.

909
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,913
I think the whole setup is bogus.
I think the distinction between the two 

910
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:32,334
groups is bogus and I think we're so 
used to having teams compete against 

911
00:42:35,341 --> 00:42:38,970
teams that we slide right into it.
I think what we really should be worried

912
00:42:38,971 --> 00:42:41,260
about is who's,
you know,

913
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,130
there should be a set of things that 
we're all worried about.

914
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,090
Who is ruining the party?
Who's,

915
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,050
who's,
who's,

916
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,903
who's doing terrible things,
who are they as it people that are 

917
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:52,884
robbing people's that people that are 
selling meth is the people that are 

918
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:57,420
murdering people who's doing all,
who's ruining the party.

919
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,070
Okay,
well first we got to find them.

920
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,170
It might be the people that are driving 
the narrative.

921
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,111
This is,
should be the.

922
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:04,440
This should be the entire focus of a 
culture.

923
00:43:04,441 --> 00:43:05,370
Okay.
Second of all,

924
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,560
where are the weak links in our chains?
Like we're.

925
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,530
How are these poor people supposed to 
get by?

926
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:12,330
How were they?
They're born into poverty.

927
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:13,640
They're born into shitty parents,
like,

928
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:14,663
how do we fucking nip that in the bud?
So we have less people that are just 

929
00:43:16,411 --> 00:43:20,370
suffering through the emotional baggage 
of being raised by fuckheads.

930
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,253
There are different.
There are different schools of thought 

931
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:22,920
on that.
Right?

932
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,240
So that's what happens.
Yeah,

933
00:43:24,241 --> 00:43:25,920
there are different schools of thought,
but let me keep going.

934
00:43:25,921 --> 00:43:27,330
And then W,
W why?

935
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,660
Why the fuck would we fight Russia?
Like why are we in Afghanistan?

936
00:43:30,661 --> 00:43:31,494
Why would we,
why would anybody do any of these 

937
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:32,910
things?

938
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,743
Like at what point in time is it going 
to be ridiculous for the idea of giant 

939
00:43:37,171 --> 00:43:38,004
groups of people to go over and try to 
fuck up other giant groups of people 

940
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,333
that are all in on it together for the 
profits of some person who probably 

941
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:44,844
doesn't give a fuck about you and is 
super happy to let you go to war for 

942
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:48,354
them so they can get more oil.
The same reason people argue the same 

943
00:43:50,551 --> 00:43:51,384
people that people.
The reason people have different points 

944
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:54,330
of view.
The two party thing,

945
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:58,590
it's the two team thing.
It's the natural inclination that people

946
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,620
have to compete against each other.
Even on a global scale.

947
00:44:01,621 --> 00:44:02,454
If it keeps ramping up,
I'm sure it works that way with like 

948
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,750
billionaires that like they want to have
the biggest yacht,

949
00:44:06,751 --> 00:44:08,640
like having a giant yacht.
It's not good enough.

950
00:44:08,641 --> 00:44:12,240
They want the biggest yacht ever and 
they keep competing against each other.

951
00:44:12,241 --> 00:44:13,860
It's just isn't that.
Isn't that human?

952
00:44:13,861 --> 00:44:15,750
Isn't that the human condition,
that conflict,

953
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:19,770
that need to impose your own?
Really,

954
00:44:19,771 --> 00:44:21,600
you're on mark.
I don't know you.

955
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:23,970
If you would ever.
If you try to change that,

956
00:44:23,971 --> 00:44:25,420
you're trying.
You're messing with human saints.

957
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:29,610
The problem is with having anyone being 
a figurehead,

958
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:32,060
I think once you have who's a figurehead
and

959
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,460
that figurehead position becomes a 
coveted position.

960
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,530
It's hard to get to.
It's very important.

961
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,810
It becomes a goal and once it becomes a 
goal,

962
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:40,644
you're going to get the super 
competitive people that are trying to 

963
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:42,444
achieve that goal and then along the way
they start realizing that they can sell 

964
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:50,010
influence and speeches and that Bill 
Clinton got paid half a million bucks,

965
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:54,340
had talked to these people for an hour 
and Hillary Clinton got 250,000

966
00:44:54,341 --> 00:44:55,174
and talk to some bankers for an hour.
Like it's like there's so much money in 

967
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:58,494
it that they start realizing like that 
position carries with it an incredible 

968
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,280
fiscal windfall.
It's called an economy of influence.

969
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,430
It's an amazing.
You know how Switzerland is ruled.

970
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,130
It's really interesting how they do it.
So they have a lot of different parties,

971
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,033
lots of different parties,
and the first three parties that when 

972
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,970
are voted in,
they get to choose two presidents each.

973
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,290
Whoa.
And those.

974
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,213
And then the fourth party,
the party that comes in fourth place 

975
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:25,680
with the fourth number of votes,
they get to elect one president.

976
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:26,723
So you actually have seven presidents 
way better idea and not only have seven 

977
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:31,950
presidents,
they all have regular jobs.

978
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:34,150
That's not their only job,
and so they meet,

979
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,650
they meet and they discuss legislation,
but guess what else?

980
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,050
Those,
those groups are the ones.

981
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,270
Those parties are the ones that elected 
their own.

982
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,120
They're their own presidents.
Yeah,

983
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:46,920
but what do they have to worry about?
Oh,

984
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:48,990
someone's invading to steal our cheese 
in our army.

985
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:49,950
Knives.
What's the great.

986
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,720
What's the great quote?
Who was descended?

987
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,823
Uh,
500 years of continual warfare in Italy 

988
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,533
gave rise to the renaissance and 500 
years of relative peace in Switzerland 

989
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,710
gave rise to the cuckoo clock,
a beautiful clock.

990
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:08,640
And the chicks are hot.

991
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:09,913
Why build things when you can just fuck 
all the girls that lived there because 

992
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:13,410
they're just super hot.
Well,

993
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,340
this term onto something or does turmoil
create beauty and it may be.

994
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,340
What is innovation?
It's a form of destruction was beauty.

995
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:22,350
You know,
what's more beautiful,

996
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:25,620
peaceful day just overlooking a field or
the Vatican.

997
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,230
I have an answer.
I bet you're wrong.

998
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,850
Well,
do you know how the Greeks top man,

999
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:30,684
you're wrong.
You know the Greeks defined it in one 

1000
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:33,740
word that you enroll Jamie.
How becky?

1001
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:36,240
You're fucking wrong.
What do you hold your breath and started

1002
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:40,090
smelling trump?
What is trump's breath smell like?

1003
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:40,924
You had to guess I can meet and for sure
a lot of flame and yon and they just 

1004
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,680
just meet and oppression and depression.
Wash and a wasp flies out.

1005
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,780
Stinks you in the face once a little.
I don't know.

1006
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,100
I bet you know what,
you know what the irony is?

1007
00:46:56,101 --> 00:46:58,110
I guarantee he'd be a fun guy to hang 
out with.

1008
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,150
He's a fucking blast.
For sure.

1009
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,380
For sure.
Use it.

1010
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,350
He'd probably be one of my favorite 
people even though Jeff Ross said he was

1011
00:47:04,351 --> 00:47:05,250
great when the,
uh,

1012
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:06,720
they roasted them,
so it was great.

1013
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:11,700
He said he even advised him to laugh at 
the jokes about him and he's like,

1014
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,200
you know,
it's like,

1015
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:14,034
it's probably better if you laugh along.
Like you don't want people to think you 

1016
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:17,880
don't have a sense of humor.
And he's like,

1017
00:47:17,881 --> 00:47:18,714
you're right.
You're right.

1018
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,820
That's great.
That's great.

1019
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,580
It's great.
I mean there's a,

1020
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,330
he's a,
he's a great American figure.

1021
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,680
He's,
well,

1022
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:26,514
he's a,
I wouldn't say great in terms of like 

1023
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,040
the

1024
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,860
overall influence that he's having on 
people right now,

1025
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,990
but as far as him being a great figure 
in terms of like big,

1026
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,183
he's a huge historical figure yet is on 
an airline for awhile has been this 

1027
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:47,910
figure in this,
like this sort of a symbol of wealth,

1028
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,580
but he's all.
It's also revitalized a lot of political

1029
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:52,414
discussion

1030
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,453
because I was forced to explain and 
articulate and think about why he's 

1031
00:47:58,441 --> 00:47:59,274
dangerous.
I was forced to look up words like 

1032
00:48:00,751 --> 00:48:01,584
demagogue.
I didn't have to look that ladies and 

1033
00:48:02,581 --> 00:48:03,540
gentlemen,
you know what I mean,

1034
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:08,220
but I was forced to do all these things 
and that in a way is good.

1035
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,320
I mean that in a way you,
you to have somebody to go,

1036
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:11,000
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1037
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,470
I,
I can't afford to be,

1038
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,340
to not be politically committed right 
now.

1039
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,380
And here's another reason I don't like 
Hillary.

1040
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,820
The uranium one deal,
and here's the way there.

1041
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,170
The reason I don't like trump,
at least it got me thinking and talking.

1042
00:48:22,171 --> 00:48:25,170
We're all talking about it and and 
younger people are listening to podcasts

1043
00:48:25,171 --> 00:48:26,910
like this,
or at least listening.

1044
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,500
Maybe they agree,
maybe they don't,

1045
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:32,340
but hopefully both so that they can then
formulate their own opinion.

1046
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,060
Eddie Bravo things.
We're going to war with Russia.

1047
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,740
Alrighty.
Well,

1048
00:48:35,741 --> 00:48:39,760
Eddie's done a lot of the big fear.
The big fear in the conservative,

1049
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,170
the conservative,
excuse me,

1050
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:42,103
conspiracy theory world is this has been
explained to me that they think that 

1051
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,123
they're going to start a war with Russia
to distract us from the wikileaks 

1052
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,500
wikileaks revelations because there's 
new ones that are coming out.

1053
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:59,500
Apparently new wiki leaks.
Stuff's coming out and as if,

1054
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:02,710
as if people don't have enemies,
everybody's anatomy in government.

1055
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,240
They couldn't answer my question.
They cut.

1056
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,790
Julian assange is a Internet connection.
What question was that?

1057
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,170
How do you define beauty as one word?
Oh,

1058
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:11,320
what is it?
It's what?

1059
00:49:11,321 --> 00:49:13,870
The Greeks and rambled for an hour.
I forgot what the fuck you suck.

1060
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:14,763
I did.
Did Not wanna make sure Fran bold 

1061
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,440
Richard brambles.
Oh,

1062
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,130
you're ready for it?
Yeah,

1063
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,900
go ahead.
And this is how you define beauty.

1064
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:24,550
How harmony.
Hmm.

1065
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,650
Interesting.
So when you see a cheetah running,

1066
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,080
why is it beautiful?
All moving parts,

1067
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:30,940
all the parts and moving,
but if it's running it,

1068
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:33,940
you're so beautiful.
It's horrible running at your kid.

1069
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,110
Fuck you.
I get it.

1070
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,610
If it's running at your kid,
is that beautiful?

1071
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,020
Good question.
It's a horror show.

1072
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:42,610
Beautiful beauty is without a doubt,
as the old expression goes in the eye of

1073
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:45,220
the beholder.
Certain people like certain things,

1074
00:49:45,221 --> 00:49:47,890
certain people like certain kinds of art
that I find disgusting.

1075
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:50,950
They love it.
They love certain kinds of music.

1076
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,980
They love certain features on people.
They love certain looks.

1077
00:49:53,981 --> 00:49:57,400
As far as clothing goes,
it's whatever the fuck you think it is.

1078
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,380
If it's beautiful to you,
it's ridiculous.

1079
00:49:59,381 --> 00:50:02,770
Anyway,
few physical beauty and the human being.

1080
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:05,950
The difference between a person who's 
cheeks are this wide,

1081
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,813
like you know,
like five inches wide or seven inches 

1082
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:09,940
wide.

1083
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,430
That extra two inches can make you look 
like a fucking Weirdo.

1084
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,560
Yes.
Symmetry,

1085
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,670
symmetry and proportion.
I'm talking about just the way you look.

1086
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,143
Not,
not that it throws you off because you 

1087
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:23,060
look at it,
the FIBONACCI sequence of a person,

1088
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,970
like that's what happens when someone 
gets a nose job,

1089
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:28,310
you know if they have like a,
a naturally huge and they get that bitch

1090
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:29,144
chopped down on something little will 
look weird about their face to you 

1091
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:36,470
because your brain is used to looking at
things in a very distinct sequence.

1092
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,453
The FIBONACCI sequence which exists on 
nautilus shells and sunflower seeds and 

1093
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,740
all these different versions of it in 
nature,

1094
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:45,950
but it also you can use that sequence.
You can use that,

1095
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:50,390
those measurements to show roughly what 
a person's facial features will be like.

1096
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,613
They're all kind of,
they say so when you surgically mess 

1097
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:54,070
with that?

1098
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:54,903
Yeah.
You fuck with the whole outline of your 

1099
00:50:57,201 --> 00:50:58,034
face.
That's like when you see someone and 

1100
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,570
their lips are way too big and their 
mouth is stretched too wide,

1101
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,600
so you know they've got started fillers 
in the horn.

1102
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:07,860
If it keeps going and some sort of a,
a,

1103
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,580
a neck job where their faces pulled 
back,

1104
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:14,150
you're.
You're immediately like your math is off

1105
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:15,490
on them.
Like you're looking at them,

1106
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,820
you're like my math off.
Like,

1107
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:18,230
why is,
why are your lips so big?

1108
00:51:18,231 --> 00:51:21,840
Like this isn't dogs I think will be 
like I've seen my neighbor used,

1109
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:24,200
do a lot of below.
My dog would flip the.

1110
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,070
She'd come and go,
hey,

1111
00:51:25,071 --> 00:51:26,080
what's going on?
In my thought was like,

1112
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,890
oh,
get the fuck away from me.

1113
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:31,600
Like my dog immediately knew some shit 
was wrong with the way she was moving a.

1114
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:32,483
But that's someone who on coke,
she was probably aggressive to your dog 

1115
00:51:35,211 --> 00:51:36,230
too and you're wearing around.

1116
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:37,483
She's probably maybe,
or she was just talking with my dog was 

1117
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:41,720
like,
I don't like this fucking person maybe,

1118
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,560
but I'm what the fuck we were talking 
about,

1119
00:51:44,561 --> 00:51:45,394
we're talking about.
And then we got to do something before 

1120
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:48,944
that.
Clarity and how beauty is beauty is 

1121
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:51,920
dictates contextual,
right?

1122
00:51:51,921 --> 00:51:52,754
It's weird how like,
there's certain things if people just 

1123
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:55,694
decide or beautiful and there's certain 
things that are beautiful to certain 

1124
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:01,130
people that just don't resonate with 
others at all,

1125
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,370
you know?
And certain people or certain looks.

1126
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,233
You know,
there's guys that are legitimately into 

1127
00:52:06,321 --> 00:52:08,200
morbidly obese women.
Yeah.

1128
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,253
Really enjoy it.
That's what's at new podcasts would 

1129
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:12,344
disagree.
I listened to that podcast and Gad said 

1130
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,103
was talking about how even congenitally 
he went through a whole litany of 

1131
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:22,040
reasons why hip to waist ratio and 
breast size and all that stuff and,

1132
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:22,903
and uh,
symmetry and proportion are biological 

1133
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:31,300
triggers for men and the idea that there
isn't a standard of beauty that turns on

1134
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,140
men in general.

1135
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,190
So,
you know,

1136
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,440
and that's what I'm saying,
there absolutely is of course,

1137
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:38,910
but there's certainly upset exceptions.
Yes,

1138
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,023
there is a giant SPEC.
That's why some guys are gay because 

1139
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:43,694
that's their,
that's where they fall into the 

1140
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:45,081
spectrum.
Their,

1141
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:46,760
their,
their beauty to them,

1142
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:49,150
what they're attracted to his men,
you know,

1143
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,720
and there's gonna be certain versions of
men that are attracted to all kinds of,

1144
00:52:53,721 --> 00:52:57,170
some kinds are attracted to giant lemon 
that can carry them around.

1145
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,330
Do you remember our crum?
I shared to hearsay.

1146
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:02,170
Sad documentary is amazing.
Great.

1147
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:06,410
I knew about him because our neighbors,
when I was a kid,

1148
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,610
you know,
my parents were hippies.

1149
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:10,730
We live in San Francisco from a age 
seven to 11.

1150
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:14,300
I lived in San Francisco and we had 
these crazy neighbors.

1151
00:53:14,301 --> 00:53:16,160
He's gay guys.
My aunt used to smoke pot,

1152
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,430
go next door and they would go get naked
and play bongos together.

1153
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:20,503
This guy was black as the sky on a,
on a moonless night and he would get 

1154
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:26,250
high as fuck

1155
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,860
and take all his clothes off and he was 
gay and his boyfriend,

1156
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,713
they would live together and they would,
they would all just get naked and play 

1157
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:33,234
bongos together.
My aunt would go down there and get 

1158
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,850
baked with them,
but anyway,

1159
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:36,684
they had these comic books.
They had our crum and there was the 

1160
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:41,240
first time I was ever exposed to our 
crump.

1161
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,040
Weird guy.
Well No,

1162
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:45,090
they would carry him.
Oh,

1163
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:46,950
that's right.
Had giant legs,

1164
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:49,410
enormous classes.
They looked like avatar.

1165
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:52,290
Women like they didn't even look like 
they were real powerful.

1166
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,360
So he was,
he was into like,

1167
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,253
like see,
like he's got this all this power 

1168
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:57,834
illuminating office,
woman's giant legs and she looks like 

1169
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,313
what you would see today,
like from some crazy mega crossfit type 

1170
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:05,880
chick,
like their big muscular legs.

1171
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:07,823
That was what he was into.
I wonder if though those kinds of 

1172
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:12,640
examples are.

1173
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:14,790
First of all,
I wonder.

1174
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:18,300
I think everybody though,
regardless of what your aberration,

1175
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,930
you're a perversion fetish is whatever 
you want to call the word.

1176
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,440
I think though that that still doesn't 
mean that they don't and can't recognize

1177
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,420
what would it be considered harmonious?
Yeah,

1178
00:54:30,421 --> 00:54:32,040
but it doesn't matter.
Like I tell her,

1179
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:36,900
obviously he keeps taking drawing photos
of these girls with giant legs and giant

1180
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:37,734
muscles and it says back that off a 
little so I could read the how to have 

1181
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:43,770
fun with a strong girl.
I stand before,

1182
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,633
before her trembling with anticipation.
Then she struts and prances around the 

1183
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:48,504
room,
boldly displaying her magnificent 

1184
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:50,814
physique.
She's full of narcissistic pride is 

1185
00:54:52,741 --> 00:54:56,430
obviously enjoying the effect she's 
having on me and it's him.

1186
00:54:56,431 --> 00:54:57,264
Our chrome,
who was just nerdy looking guy and he's 

1187
00:54:59,311 --> 00:55:03,210
got boxer shorts on with a boner and 
socks and his hairy legs.

1188
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,213
Really hilarious writing and hilarious 
artwork and that was what he was all 

1189
00:55:08,521 --> 00:55:10,470
about.
It was all this weird perverted shit.

1190
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:12,960
So I got exposed to this stuff when I 
was like,

1191
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,240
shit,
I guess I was like eight,

1192
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,580
somewhere around eight or nine.
I was like,

1193
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:20,670
what the fuck is going on?
Why is this guy into like giant women?

1194
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:21,810
Like,
what the fuck is this?

1195
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:23,183
Yeah.
And he had a bunch of different like 

1196
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:25,260
characters that he would,
uh,

1197
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,740
draw and all of these weird comic books.
But,

1198
00:55:28,741 --> 00:55:29,210
you know,
it's,

1199
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,270
yeah,
there's a girl at a giant in,

1200
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,680
you know,
what's really weird her first day in the

1201
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:36,030
city.
I mean this is,

1202
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,730
I saw this kind of stuff when I was real
little.

1203
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,380
Okay.
Well how do you explain this?

1204
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,220
So for me,
look at the,

1205
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,890
all that asshole hair.
It's amazing.

1206
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:46,350
It's such a good piece coming out with 
his nose in the air.

1207
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,080
Um,
I,

1208
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,013
I don't,
I don't know if that messes with my 

1209
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:51,204
head.
What does that title that's going to be 

1210
00:55:52,321 --> 00:55:54,000
my next tattoo?
My first tattoo.

1211
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,530
Her first day in the city.
If you're looking for it,

1212
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,740
Google that original art crumb.
What does it say?

1213
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:06,000
The rest snatches snatch comics.
Is that the snatch?

1214
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,313
So he had a lot of vagina base.
He's stepping into her vagina and he's 

1215
00:56:10,321 --> 00:56:12,540
looking around.
He's looking around at this.

1216
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:15,600
Notice that giant vagina.
He's about to step to step into it.

1217
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,810
Gosh.
Contract type hood.

1218
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,653
Sure.
Get a type could sure get last round 

1219
00:56:22,101 --> 00:56:25,810
here and not to step into her vagina.
Looks like a chicken.

1220
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:29,930
Looks like I'm a tunnel.
Here's hoping.

1221
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,650
Take City woman been.
Oh my God.

1222
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:35,410
It's a metaphor.
But here's,

1223
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,120
here's the thing that's confusing.
I am very attracted to crossfit.

1224
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,340
Very muscular women.
I think that's hot,

1225
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:42,610
right?

1226
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:44,680
So I'd love to have one that can beat 
your ass.

1227
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:45,543
Nope.
I just like that power in the legs and 

1228
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,150
like a message you'd like them to 
underestimate you and you without russel

1229
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:50,980
them.
Is that your move?

1230
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,940
I mean that has been in the past,
but that's less.

1231
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:56,860
What's interesting.
I think when I see a crossfit woman,

1232
00:56:56,861 --> 00:56:57,694
like a woman who's just got a blow out 
ass and powerful legs and all that and 

1233
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:01,264
uh,
back on her,

1234
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,253
maybe I want to breed with our swipes.
So maybe primarily I want to be with 

1235
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:06,310
her.
So my kids are studs,

1236
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,890
but I just find it physically very 
attractive.

1237
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:11,340
When a girl's got to an asset,
you should find our chrome.

1238
00:57:11,341 --> 00:57:12,930
He lives in Paris,
which you could hang out.

1239
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:14,320
You could just jerk off together.
Well,

1240
00:57:14,321 --> 00:57:16,750
hold on because you're drawing Sarah.
Hold on,

1241
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:17,710
hold on sir.

1242
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,730
Because then there's the other side of 
me that likes a super feminine,

1243
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:22,564
petite,
curvy woman and that might be who I'd 

1244
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:26,584
rather cuddle with and date.
Whereas the other one I just want to 

1245
00:57:30,661 --> 00:57:33,190
have animal sex with and so there's 
this.

1246
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,450
I'm kind of pulled.
Yeah.

1247
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:35,850
Welcome to being a man.
Motherfucker.

1248
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,840
Why you making this sound like it's a 
big complicated issue.

1249
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:38,674
Oh Man.
I'm just saying I have to say maybe I 

1250
00:57:40,281 --> 00:57:42,060
just like all different kinds of went 
over you.

1251
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:46,990
This is what I'm into.
I like my shakes in white chicks.

1252
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,880
Maybe there's a problem.
You're right.

1253
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,220
What I'm saying is I'm attracted to 
everybody.

1254
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,323
Well,
that's part of the problem with being a 

1255
00:57:53,951 --> 00:57:54,784
man is a genetically.
You're designed to spread them jeans 

1256
00:57:58,091 --> 00:58:00,940
around as much as possible to ensure the
survival of the race.

1257
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,610
However,
that's not really necessary anymore.

1258
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,070
Like we used to die really young.

1259
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:06,933
We were eaten by things left and right,
so we have this fucking insatiable 

1260
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,370
instinct to fuck all the time and get 
rid of loads and make people,

1261
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,653
but there's a lot of us now,
like we figured it out somewhere along 

1262
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:17,134
the line,
but we still have the genes of people 

1263
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:21,520
that live 10,000
years ago when your survival,

1264
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,713
it wasn't guaranteed at all and it was 
most likely that something would go 

1265
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:30,490
wrong and so the,
the likelihood of you staying alive past

1266
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:31,324
30 or 40 was very low,
so there was like a frantic urge to 

1267
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:35,524
live.
Yeah.

1268
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:36,543
You know,
I think if we knew that we had way less 

1269
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:41,490
time and that it was,
the death was way more common.

1270
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,240
If we start 10 year olds will be walking
on pregnant.

1271
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,280
Yeah.
And that's how it is normally.

1272
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:46,143
Yeah.
I think we decided some someone roll on 

1273
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:48,850
the lawn,
rightly so.

1274
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:52,180
That's not,
that's not healthy for our species.

1275
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:53,163
It's not healthy for our culture.
It's not healthy for children to be 

1276
00:58:55,571 --> 00:58:58,330
burdened down by the responsibility of 
being a parent.

1277
00:58:58,331 --> 00:58:59,164
While they're still trying to figure it 
out and they'd probably do a way better 

1278
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:01,834
job if they waited,
so all that stuff is sort of balancing 

1279
00:59:03,971 --> 00:59:07,240
itself out now because people are 
becoming more and more aware of it,

1280
00:59:07,241 --> 00:59:08,270
so we don't,
but we're still.

1281
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,340
We still have the same genes,
so the same fucking caveman genes.

1282
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:16,510
The genetics have to be like constantly 
managed by the psyche,

1283
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:20,740
constantly managed by discipline,
constantly managed by thinking,

1284
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,853
you know,
whether it's yelling at somebody in 

1285
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:23,684
traffic or whether it's all the other 
ridiculous male instincts that people 

1286
00:59:27,741 --> 00:59:28,574
have to,
whether it's a star wars or to kick 

1287
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:35,240
their ass because they're rooting for 
the wrong team and all that stuff is.

1288
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,133
It's based on like these ancient reward 
systems that we've got stuck in our 

1289
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:41,740
pilot.
Things like excitement.

1290
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:42,583
It can be really weird things secretly 
for excitement and ideas to get charged 

1291
00:59:46,431 --> 00:59:46,911
up.
Yeah.

1292
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:50,120
Being not as good word,
a naughty bus.

1293
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,910
The naughty list.
Pernod is huge because my friend,

1294
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:58,690
when I was with my buddy one time and 
this giant woman giant a big Oh my God.

1295
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,000
No,
I'm not joking.

1296
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,830
Three hundred pounds.
Gabby Garcia big.

1297
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:04,331
Yeah,
but,

1298
01:00:04,331 --> 01:00:05,220
but,
but,

1299
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,470
but curvy are way more.
Have giant tits.

1300
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,870
Jaimee.
She was every bit of six foot five.

1301
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:13,610
Oh my God.
I'm not exaggerating with her shoes off.

1302
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:14,510
I'm not kidding.
Oh my God.

1303
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:16,130
Uh,
I'll tell you later.

1304
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:16,993
I think you should be.
You're asking more detailed with this 

1305
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:19,760
story that everyone thinks she can beat 
your ass.

1306
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,100
There's,
she could eat me as a whole.

1307
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,930
I mean,
I never had to fight for your life.

1308
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:24,763
If you were in a hotel ballroom,
you got locked in there with her and 

1309
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,160
she's coming full clip.
She has.

1310
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:30,230
This is for real.
She had no training.

1311
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:32,120
Uh,
maybe I could tie her out,

1312
01:00:32,121 --> 01:00:34,400
but I'd have no.
The answer is probably not.

1313
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,630
Wow.
Fuck her up.

1314
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,630
She'd come get some.
You.

1315
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:41,270
She's,
you're ready.

1316
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,800
You're ready to get low.
If a giant woman,

1317
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,200
I'll tell you right now,
there is a giant.

1318
01:00:48,201 --> 01:00:51,170
There is a size where that a woman would
hit where you.

1319
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,300
Regardless you.
There is that number.

1320
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,430
How tall,
how heaven can't hear this.

1321
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:56,690
Just bet on me,
dude.

1322
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,070
Really?
I'm gonna kick her ass.

1323
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:01,300
No woman from ever getting into a street
fight with 350 pounds,

1324
01:01:01,301 --> 01:01:03,380
six foot five woman,
no woman on the planet.

1325
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:05,060
I'm going to kick her out.
So she's there,

1326
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:07,320
she's there and I and I,
and she says hi.

1327
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,530
She recognizes me and I go,
oh,

1328
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,060
I'm kidding.
Big giant women.

1329
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:13,580
Don't try to beat me up.
These are just jokes.

1330
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:17,090
These are all just silly woman.
Leave me the fuck alone.

1331
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:17,924
Don't hurt me.

1332
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:23,750
Just a bunch of waiting outside the 
door.

1333
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,210
Motherfucker.
She has a beard.

1334
01:01:26,211 --> 01:01:28,630
He sure you're a woman.
I'm just,

1335
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,500
dude,
I know shot,

1336
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:33,260
uh,
an antelope or some,

1337
01:01:33,261 --> 01:01:34,094
some animal in Africa that was a 
Hermaphrodite knew it was a female 

1338
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:39,554
animal.
Antelope with crazy horns like these 

1339
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:44,870
crazy antlers that like curved in some 
weird way.

1340
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:48,830
We're actually digging into its head who
was actually a call animal.

1341
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,120
They had to put it down because it's the
way its horn was growing.

1342
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:55,910
It was like literally growing into its 
head.

1343
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,070
Oh Damn.
It was comfortable.

1344
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,730
It was a very weird case.
And they also,

1345
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:02,564
I guess they wanted to study its body 
because they were pretty sure it was a 

1346
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:06,290
hermaphrodite wow.
Yeah,

1347
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,330
that's a weird fucked.
Again,

1348
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:11,460
all those genetic aberrations happened.
Yeah.

1349
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:16,040
I was talking to this woman from South 
Africa recently at this party.

1350
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,740
I told you the story about all the kids 
that um,

1351
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:20,010
or

1352
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,740
she grew up in.
She lives in South Africa for awhile and

1353
01:02:22,741 --> 01:02:26,670
it's really funny because she was 
talking about mountain lions and now how

1354
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:27,504
hilarious it is.
The people are worried about mountain 

1355
01:02:28,741 --> 01:02:32,690
lions.
We would have to worry about that.

1356
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:36,780
Rely on water.
Buffalo snakes,

1357
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:38,790
all the above.
All of the above.

1358
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,713
Um,
but she was talking about a kids in 

1359
01:02:42,781 --> 01:02:47,781
silicone valley that are having problems
dealing with their,

1360
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,333
they're hyper successful parents and the
lack of time and attention that's being 

1361
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:58,260
paid to them.
And there's like a gigantic epidemic,

1362
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:01,740
suicides and all kinds of crazy shit.
They're cutting each other.

1363
01:03:01,741 --> 01:03:03,990
And it was a really disturbing 
conversation.

1364
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,060
And she called it,
what they call,

1365
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,620
what they call it.
Affluenza.

1366
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:10,470
You know,
that's the term for young rich kids.

1367
01:03:10,471 --> 01:03:13,560
But the thing is like nobody cared,
like they didn't ask to be rich,

1368
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:15,090
but we blame them for being rich.

1369
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:18,690
So like you don't look at a young rich 
kid as like a young kid with problems.

1370
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,321
You Go,
Oh,

1371
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:21,060
poor rich baby,
you know,

1372
01:03:21,061 --> 01:03:25,830
like that somehow now that the money 
that these kids have when they're 16,

1373
01:03:25,831 --> 01:03:29,130
they have a fucking fresh BMW.
The money that money provides connection

1374
01:03:29,131 --> 01:03:30,360
and love and,
and,

1375
01:03:30,361 --> 01:03:34,230
and that you mean something to your 
parents because it's so unattainable for

1376
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:35,064
so many folks.
Money and being rich like one of these 

1377
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,710
kids seems like,
well they hit the lottery.

1378
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:41,544
I'm supposed to feel bad for them.
But you don't realize that like they 

1379
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:45,680
didn't ask for that.
First of all,

1380
01:03:45,681 --> 01:03:47,880
they didn't ask to be born that.
And it's not ideal.

1381
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:48,863
It's not working out well.
You'd be way better off with a happy 

1382
01:03:52,141 --> 01:03:52,974
healthy parents that were around and 
went to your sports events and hung out 

1383
01:03:56,251 --> 01:04:01,170
with Ya and did things with you and,
and were there all the time and gave you

1384
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,150
a feeling of comfort while you're 
growing up.

1385
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:05,130
So you can grow up with like a sense of 
security,

1386
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,020
like there's a lot of these kids that 
are grown up,

1387
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,830
they are all fucked up because their 
parents are never around.

1388
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:11,843
So you don't feel like you matter or you
don't feel in many ways you feel like 

1389
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:18,540
you were thrown away and rampant drug 
abuse,

1390
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:19,374
man.
The amount of kids that are doing pain 

1391
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:24,750
pills today as apparently just off the 
charts,

1392
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:25,823
they're doing adderall for studying and 
for for examinations and they're doing 

1393
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:30,744
pain pills all the time.
It's just become an epidemic with 

1394
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:36,290
people.
They're so fucking easy to get.

1395
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:39,820
I know they're trying to curb that.
I try to make it more difficult to get,

1396
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,673
but there's still a ton of money that's 
being pumped into the system from the 

1397
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:46,290
manufacturers of these,
as you were talking about before,

1398
01:04:46,291 --> 01:04:48,960
about the use of influence and in 
politics.

1399
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:52,600
The company that makes fentanyl is that 
I said I never figured that out.

1400
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:53,434
So fentanyl,
they spent a half of a fucking million 

1401
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:02,100
dollars on ads in Arizona just to try to
make medical marijuana illegal.

1402
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:07,080
Try to make it to to to do ads against 
them in their recreational,

1403
01:05:07,081 --> 01:05:09,210
like why would they give a fuck?
Why are they doing that?

1404
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,073
Like why would,
why would the makers of a pill like 

1405
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,373
Google that too?
Because it's another thing I keep 

1406
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:15,024
wondering about how much stronger is 
that shit that oxycontin because it's 

1407
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:18,160
much

1408
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,770
stronger.
Thought it was an elephant tranquilizer.

1409
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:22,960
I maybe I'm wrong.
I don't know that what they were putting

1410
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:25,010
in the heroin and everybody was dying.
Okay.

1411
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,830
They that,
that I think is an elephant.

1412
01:05:26,831 --> 01:05:29,430
Tranquilizer,
fentanyl,

1413
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:30,723
whatever it is.
I don't know if it's an elephant 

1414
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:34,120
tranquilizer they use on the elephants 
and people,

1415
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:34,954
but they definitely use it on people.
It was something to be stronger right 

1416
01:05:38,591 --> 01:05:39,180
then then,
then,

1417
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,900
then,
then I don't know.

1418
01:05:40,901 --> 01:05:44,050
We're trying to find that out.
I think at least I remember the number.

1419
01:05:44,051 --> 01:05:44,884
10

1420
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:50,220
inverse.com.
It looks like an okay story written on.

1421
01:05:50,221 --> 01:05:52,830
It says it's 80 times as potent as 
morphine.

1422
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,820
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1423
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:58,680
Which is 80 times of times the animal 
analgesic punch of heroin.

1424
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:01,310
Well,
Jesus said,

1425
01:06:01,311 --> 01:06:03,050
there you go.
That's got to be good.

1426
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:03,711
Yeah.
Well,

1427
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:08,711
this is what people are dropping dead 
off and the company that makes that shit

1428
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:11,143
is trying to put out ads or pay for the 
campaign against marijuana being 

1429
01:06:17,781 --> 01:06:20,480
recreationally legal,
which is just fucking crazy.

1430
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,550
It's crazy.
You know?

1431
01:06:22,551 --> 01:06:23,384
I know that they think that they're 
going to lose profit from marijuana 

1432
01:06:24,951 --> 01:06:25,784
being legal,
so I know that they're acting out of a 

1433
01:06:26,871 --> 01:06:29,540
business purpose.
It's that's just what businesses do,

1434
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:30,613
but you just expect them on something 
that's so fucking important culturally 

1435
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:37,430
and such an important precedent like 
that.

1436
01:06:37,431 --> 01:06:40,640
Any company that's against marijuana 
becoming legal,

1437
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:45,700
that is such a damaging position to take
and if you get away with it today,

1438
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,800
by the time people examine this and by 
the time it's looked back on five,

1439
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:52,310
10 years from now,
whatever it is,

1440
01:06:52,311 --> 01:06:53,144
you're gonna look preposterous,
that you spent any money to try to make 

1441
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,930
marijuana illegal reason.

1442
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:03,980
I think no reason why anyone should step
in and try to make it illegal.

1443
01:07:05,241 --> 01:07:06,074
It's the will of the people and there is
no medical evidence whatsoever that 

1444
01:07:09,531 --> 01:07:10,364
shows that it's even remotely as 
dangerous as a million different things 

1445
01:07:13,281 --> 01:07:14,360
that are already illegal.
But that's,

1446
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,650
see,
that's another,

1447
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,980
that's sort of another example of what I
was talking about before,

1448
01:07:18,981 --> 01:07:19,814
which is that you can try to legislate 
and pass laws and enforce sort of your 

1449
01:07:24,651 --> 01:07:28,520
view of reality of World War,
what you think is good for people,

1450
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:32,300
but what's it seems to me a better way 
to go is to win the idea,

1451
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:36,350
what do the idea that marijuana is not 
as destructive.

1452
01:07:36,351 --> 01:07:39,140
For example,
in many ways I'm not an expert,

1453
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:41,930
but in many ways to say alcohol,
which is legal.

1454
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:42,500
Well,
it's just.

1455
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,330
You don't even have to say I'm not an 
expert.

1456
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:48,320
It's absolutely scientifically proven 
fact,

1457
01:07:48,321 --> 01:07:49,154
but that act.
But that took time to not only be sort 

1458
01:07:52,521 --> 01:07:53,354
of enough experiment just in real life 
and real time started to prove that to 

1459
01:07:58,821 --> 01:07:59,654
be true,
but then that idea and that experience 

1460
01:08:01,501 --> 01:08:06,480
had to dissipate into the national or 
international collective conscious.

1461
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:08,150
Part of that was because of Richard 
Nixon,

1462
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:12,680
Richard Nixon funded study.
They put studies together to try to find

1463
01:08:12,681 --> 01:08:14,420
out what are the bad things about 
marijuana.

1464
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:16,070
They couldn't find anything.
No.

1465
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,770
This is way before that when reefer 
madness was in 19 thirties,

1466
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:19,853
the the shit that Nixon did,
Nixon pass a sweeping set psychedelic 

1467
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:25,100
act of 1970.
That made everything scheduled.

1468
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,550
One those dmt and mushrooms and all that
shit and that Nixon did and yeah,

1469
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:30,530
it was during his administration and 
they also.

1470
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:31,693
One of the things they did was they did 
these studies on marijuana trying to 

1471
01:08:33,921 --> 01:08:36,170
find things that were bad.
They couldn't,

1472
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,080
and when the studies came up with 
favorable results,

1473
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:41,180
they buried them.
And this is also been proven,

1474
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:45,110
so this is shit they knew for a long 
fucking time.

1475
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,710
It's just a team thing.
It's going back to that same thing again

1476
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,630
is pro and con.
There's,

1477
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:51,501
there's,
you know,

1478
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:54,620
right and left and even along this 
marijuana thing,

1479
01:08:54,621 --> 01:08:55,454
there's a bunch of people that are 
scrambling to try to keep it illegal as 

1480
01:08:57,951 --> 01:08:58,790
long as possible.

1481
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:01,730
So that continues their profits with 
painkillers.

1482
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:05,600
Painkillers are worried that if 
marijuana becomes legal,

1483
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,940
if marijuana,
especially edible marijuana,

1484
01:09:07,941 --> 01:09:11,600
which is incredibly potent but doesn't 
have any of the fucking downsides,

1485
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,610
doesn't have any of the negative 
effects.

1486
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:16,280
No one's dying from it,
which is the biggest one,

1487
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,133
right,
and it's been shown to help so many 

1488
01:09:18,261 --> 01:09:21,290
people with seizures,
so many different diseases.

1489
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,153
People that have aids,
people that are on chemotherapy is 

1490
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,590
hundreds and hundreds of different 
things that it's been shown to help with

1491
01:09:27,591 --> 01:09:28,530
people with,
um,

1492
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:30,970
uh,
what is it?

1493
01:09:30,971 --> 01:09:33,590
I'm glaucoma.
What is that for the ocular pressure,

1494
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:34,493
international ocular pressure,
relieved that it's amazing for 

1495
01:09:36,951 --> 01:09:37,784
inflammation for people that have back 
problems and all sorts of other issues 

1496
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,170
regarding pain and inflammatory issues 
that people have,

1497
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,053
but these are the things that would 
profit from keeping it illegal are the 

1498
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:57,890
same things to killing people and the 
idea that they're allowed to do that and

1499
01:09:57,891 --> 01:10:00,950
that no one steps in and no politicians 
talk about it being huge,

1500
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:02,510
evil,
and a real problem.

1501
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:04,970
It's one of the things that's left 
completely off the debate.

1502
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,073
It's not to diminish sexual assault 
because obviously that's really 

1503
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:09,620
important.
It's not to diminish primary,

1504
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:10,693
obviously that's really important and 
those pay to play stuff and all these 

1505
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:16,130
accusations of corruption on both sides.
It's all very important,

1506
01:10:16,131 --> 01:10:19,460
but man sows that love.
That is.

1507
01:10:19,461 --> 01:10:22,880
And also learning how to distinguish and
learning,

1508
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:26,990
learning how to distinguish what you 
should label,

1509
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:29,410
for example,
a psychedelic or.

1510
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:29,811
Well,
not,

1511
01:10:29,811 --> 01:10:30,650
not,
not just that,

1512
01:10:30,651 --> 01:10:35,651
but sometimes I wonder if if when you 
call for the legalization of marijuana,

1513
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:38,540
which I would do,
of course,

1514
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:43,010
and I've always said that ultimately 
it's all about letting people make their

1515
01:10:43,011 --> 01:10:43,844
own choices,
but I wonder if it's important to 

1516
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:50,240
distinguish between drugs,
like do you think that it certainly is.

1517
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:55,241
Heroin and cocaine should also be legal.
I think as an adult,

1518
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:59,240
as you Brian Callen the idea that me as 
me,

1519
01:10:59,241 --> 01:11:03,620
Joe Rogan could tell you you can't do 
heroin is preposterous.

1520
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:06,080
Who the fuck am I?
Who am I to tell you?

1521
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,033
Well,
you can do it under a doctor's 

1522
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:10,000
supervision or you could do morphine.
You gonna have to have a morphine drip.

1523
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:10,980
You have a button.
You're pressing.

1524
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,160
The morphine goes into your bloodstream.
Man,

1525
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:14,100
I don't know.
All

1526
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:14,933
I know is a lot of fucking people are 
dying from pain pills and politicians 

1527
01:11:18,121 --> 01:11:20,700
never discuss it and why don't they talk
about it.

1528
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:21,863
Just stop and think about is is is the 
big issue of one super rich guy who was 

1529
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:26,424
a pussy grabber or is the big issue half
a million people dying from cigarettes 

1530
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,830
in this country alone every year?
Is that an issue?

1531
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:38,460
How come at issues and discuss if there 
was something else that was killing half

1532
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,750
a million people a year,
wouldn't we freak out?

1533
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:40,331
I agree.
100.

1534
01:11:40,331 --> 01:11:42,030
If there was some new sport would have 
parked.

1535
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:42,864
Core was claiming a half a million kids 
every year saying that are saying the 

1536
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:46,973
bigger,
more challenging issues than a guy who 

1537
01:11:49,741 --> 01:11:52,450
is a groper.
I would imagine roper.

1538
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:53,363
I think it's terrible to be a groper.
I think it's certainly something that 

1539
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:57,390
should be discussed.
That's not the problem.

1540
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,370
The problem is they're not discussing 
this other thing.

1541
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,233
No,
they're not discussing how many fucking 

1542
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:03,690
people are hooked on painkillers.
It's giant,

1543
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:04,823
massive epidemic and the idea that the 
same people that are selling those 

1544
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:11,340
painkillers are actively working to make
sure that marijuana stays illegal.

1545
01:12:11,341 --> 01:12:12,174
He lets you know that you're in a crazy 
system when the protectors and the 

1546
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:19,410
politicians don't bring that up at all 
because who's driving the narrative?

1547
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,273
Think about who's driving.
Think about drive and then the people 

1548
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:25,030
who are driving,
driving the narrative in the,

1549
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:26,220
for example,
in the lip,

1550
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,950
in the New York liberal media,
right?

1551
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:33,420
That is why is it academics were 
academics and why is academia?

1552
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:38,490
Why is that driving the narrative on 
everything from gender to even social?

1553
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:39,423
Why?
Why?

1554
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,210
Because we don't live in the real world.
We assume they're the smarter ones,

1555
01:12:42,211 --> 01:12:43,044
but they're they.
They have theoretical knowledge and I 

1556
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:46,014
think there's a place for academics and 
I think there's an obvious place for a 

1557
01:12:48,901 --> 01:12:52,590
strong intellectual energy,
but my God,

1558
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,220
there's nothing.

1559
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:56,910
There's no group more intolerant to new 
ideas in many ways.

1560
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:01,560
I would say religious people were far 
more intolerant than academics.

1561
01:13:01,561 --> 01:13:04,530
I would think that academics on a whole 
would probably be very tonal pens.

1562
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,560
They just lean left.
They just leaned left almost,

1563
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:10,010
almost exclusively,
except when it comes to like economic.

1564
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:10,923
I don't think they're tolerant at all.
I think they suffer from collective 

1565
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:15,570
madness,
in fact.

1566
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,010
Well,
gender mania,

1567
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:17,850
I think.
Look at,

1568
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:18,810
look at.
Look at this.

1569
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:23,010
Let's take trump.
I actually resent the fact that first of

1570
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:23,844
all,
obviously I've never been a fan of this 

1571
01:13:25,621 --> 01:13:26,454
guys,
but I resent the fact that people seem 

1572
01:13:28,141 --> 01:13:28,974
to be equating equating a groping and 
even even a kissing somebody or talking 

1573
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:43,761
about it as rape,
sexual assault to a woman,

1574
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,113
a woman who doesn't want it.
If he comes up and grabs you on the 

1575
01:13:48,931 --> 01:13:51,570
poster is sexual assault.
I would agree with that,

1576
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:54,390
but that is one of the accusations,
right?

1577
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:55,523
Well,
I want to distinguish between what is 

1578
01:13:57,991 --> 01:14:01,950
that sexual misconduct?
Is it sexual assault?

1579
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:04,170
What is,
what is the girl loves it.

1580
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:09,030
Then it's neither like if she,
if she pulls her panties to the side and

1581
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,610
he goes,
oh daddy goes down it and like you found

1582
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,180
a freak,

1583
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:12,881
right?
You know,

1584
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:15,880
but he took a big fucking chance where 
you just grab the pussy.

1585
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:17,470
She probably asked,
well you're an asshole.

1586
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:18,700
She probably just say,
hey,

1587
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:19,950
you're thinking about grabbing your 
posts.

1588
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:20,880
You're here.
What do you think?

1589
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,960
Want to think about it for awhile?
I'll be out here waiting.

1590
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:25,240
You've got to give her time to.
And not under pressure.

1591
01:14:25,241 --> 01:14:27,040
You don't want be looming over was a big
guy.

1592
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:29,200
So he asked the Lord lawyer show.

1593
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:31,403
I think these.
These are really important distinctions 

1594
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:35,730
because otherwise people that are a 
woman who's held down.

1595
01:14:35,731 --> 01:14:37,740
Let's just take a terrible example,
a woman,

1596
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:38,930
a stranger,
breaks into your house,

1597
01:14:38,931 --> 01:14:40,580
holds you down and rapes her,
right?

1598
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:44,160
We would all agree that that is,
that is fucking horrifying,

1599
01:14:44,161 --> 01:14:44,994
right?
And if you've found the guy be hard not 

1600
01:14:46,261 --> 01:14:48,030
to kill the guy and all that stuff,
but,

1601
01:14:48,031 --> 01:14:50,280
but let's make it.
Let's make a distinction.

1602
01:14:50,281 --> 01:14:51,180
Ready?
Ready?

1603
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:54,600
A big bully.
A guy like trump comes up,

1604
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:55,790
grabs you and,
and,

1605
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:58,850
and puts his fingers in your mouth.
That's pretty.

1606
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:00,180
That's pretty invasive.
So hot.

1607
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,103
That's fucking evasive.
And you're and you work for the guy and 

1608
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:07,440
you're scared to lose your job.
And he grabs you and he puts his finger,

1609
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:08,460
came out and he goes,
come on baby.

1610
01:15:08,461 --> 01:15:09,294
Give me a kiss.
And because you're so afraid and so 

1611
01:15:11,281 --> 01:15:13,170
overwhelmed,
you don't know what to do,

1612
01:15:13,171 --> 01:15:14,310
and he starts kissing you and you're 
like,

1613
01:15:14,311 --> 01:15:15,660
oh Jesus,
let this be over with.

1614
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:18,600
I'm sure that's happened 1 million times
in life with women.

1615
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,700
And this is why women when they see that
shit,

1616
01:15:20,701 --> 01:15:21,960
they go,
I've met a guy like that.

1617
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:25,140
I've been 10 guys like that.
And that's why the reaction for women is

1618
01:15:25,141 --> 01:15:26,160
like,
fuck this guy.

1619
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:29,010
He's going to fall by 14 points.
However,

1620
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:33,870
let's as as citizens and in this 
discussion in the law,

1621
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:36,240
you have to make a distinction.
Even the media,

1622
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,253
because if you start calling that rape 
or if you start calling that sexual 

1623
01:15:40,801 --> 01:15:41,850
assault versus,
I don't know,

1624
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,870
sexual misconduct or I don't know.

1625
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,110
Wait,
hold on a second.

1626
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:48,830
If somebody grabs you and kisses you and
you don't want them to do that,

1627
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:52,340
it means that is.
It is a form of assault.

1628
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:57,570
Not Assault punching you in the face,
but it should be illegal to hold you and

1629
01:15:58,311 --> 01:16:01,880
detain you and like and forced a kiss on
you.

1630
01:16:01,881 --> 01:16:04,770
Like you're violating that person's 
physical space.

1631
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:05,923
You're violating their humanity because 
you're choosing to enforce your wants 

1632
01:16:08,961 --> 01:16:10,880
and needs over what they want.
Budget.

1633
01:16:10,881 --> 01:16:13,610
Would you equate this problem?
Fucking,

1634
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:16,280
you know,
and I know that there have been times in

1635
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:17,114
people's lives when someone has grabbed 
a woman and kissed her and she loved it 

1636
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,250
and they want up getting married and 
having kids.

1637
01:16:22,251 --> 01:16:23,084
Yes.
You never fucking know who the hell 

1638
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:27,590
knows?
I mean like no one wants sexual assault,

1639
01:16:27,591 --> 01:16:28,424
right?
No one wants anyone to have anything 

1640
01:16:29,781 --> 01:16:31,040
done to them against their will.

1641
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,440
No one does this rational or kind in a 
way,

1642
01:16:33,441 --> 01:16:36,410
shape or form.
But we all know there's crazy moments in

1643
01:16:36,411 --> 01:16:37,100
life,
right?

1644
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:40,040
You know,
there's weird things happen with people.

1645
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:42,290
People had sex without saying a word to 
each other.

1646
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,180
Dan Bilzerian was just talking about the
other day.

1647
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,650
Sure.
He met some girl in Paris.

1648
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:47,990
He purposely went out of his way to not 
say a word,

1649
01:16:47,991 --> 01:16:49,850
see if he could do it and had sex with a
girl.

1650
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,433
There's no consent there.
It's just implied consent based on 

1651
01:16:53,571 --> 01:16:55,050
physical movement.
So,

1652
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:55,491
so,
so.

1653
01:16:55,491 --> 01:16:56,450
So in other words,
still,

1654
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:01,310
but my point is yes,
but my point is do you shouldn't compare

1655
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:02,203
worst versions of rape and say that this
version of what you would call sexual 

1656
01:17:06,921 --> 01:17:11,921
assault is not that big of a deal,
but you're kind of saying that by saying

1657
01:17:12,201 --> 01:17:13,034
that you're calling it why call,
but you're diminishing the horribleness 

1658
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:16,694
of the other people's experiences by 
actually getting physically raped and 

1659
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:20,303
well,
the nights of their neck and getting 

1660
01:17:20,691 --> 01:17:21,524
fucked by a book,
there has to be a difference right 

1661
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:23,990
there.

1662
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:24,823
Has,
there is a difference that the physical 

1663
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,740
action is different in every single one.
I mean it's,

1664
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,593
it's,
it's different in a girl gets pulled 

1665
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:35,840
over and the cop makes her suck his dick
get out of a ticket.

1666
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:37,000
People have done that,
right?

1667
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,080
That's,
that's a different thing than,

1668
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:40,063
than uh,
than a girl who grabs her a male 

1669
01:17:42,381 --> 01:17:44,030
employees dick all the time.
I mean,

1670
01:17:44,031 --> 01:17:44,864
that's a,
that's unwanted and he doesn't want to 

1671
01:17:45,951 --> 01:17:47,900
lose his job,
but that's not as threatening.

1672
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:48,734
How about this?
There's a bunch of different 

1673
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:51,560
experiences.
My point in her,

1674
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:56,120
like anyone who's been grabbed,
that doesn't mean that I mean by by,

1675
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:59,060
by saying that it's not as bad as 
getting raped.

1676
01:17:59,061 --> 01:18:00,110
That's like saying,
yeah,

1677
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,150
of course it's not as bad as gang raped 
and murdered.

1678
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:03,223
It's not as bad as getting raped and 
murdered and they make you eat yourself 

1679
01:18:05,631 --> 01:18:09,330
before they kill you.
It's going worse and worse and worse

1680
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,470
saying is that I feel there's a 
movement,

1681
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:16,690
a movement to have to treat all the 
perpetrators of that kind of behavior as

1682
01:18:17,171 --> 01:18:19,420
one.
And I think that's what standards.

1683
01:18:19,421 --> 01:18:22,450
So for example,
you have a guy who meets a girl.

1684
01:18:22,451 --> 01:18:23,960
She does,
you know,

1685
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:26,270
she drinks 15 Margarita's,
uh,

1686
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:28,300
you guys making out.
You're dancing.

1687
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,740
Uh,
you go,

1688
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:31,570
he follows her.
I don't know what happens.

1689
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:32,850
Next thing you know,
somebody sees her.

1690
01:18:32,851 --> 01:18:33,684
He's on top of her making out with her 
and he's fingering her and she was out 

1691
01:18:36,071 --> 01:18:37,260
cold.
She's cold,

1692
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,530
she's holding the.
Hold on,

1693
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,330
hold on.
Now.

1694
01:18:40,331 --> 01:18:42,940
We now in California,
that's not considered rape.

1695
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,310
Somebody had to sit down and go,
what's rape?

1696
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,170
Let's define it.
Fingers in the mouth,

1697
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,060
fingers in the vagina or penis in 
vagina.

1698
01:18:49,061 --> 01:18:52,270
We got to make these definitions and the
law,

1699
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,940
the law tends to make very strong 
distinctions,

1700
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:55,793
knows distinctions have been thought 
about and fought over and stuff like 

1701
01:18:57,971 --> 01:18:58,804
that.
And then we,

1702
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:01,550
we penalize people accordingly.
Okay.

1703
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:02,560
Okay.
Okay.

1704
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:05,650
However,
it seems to me that in,

1705
01:19:05,651 --> 01:19:08,380
for example,
on certain colleges,

1706
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:11,530
they now have investigative committee 
committees,

1707
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,393
investigative communities who decide 
whether or not this was sexual assault 

1708
01:19:15,911 --> 01:19:16,744
or whether or not this was rape,
where I think actually that should be 

1709
01:19:21,731 --> 01:19:24,130
anytime there's sexual,
you know,

1710
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:29,530
assault or rape,
shouldn't that be the police's job?

1711
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,960
Shouldn't that be reported immediately 
to the police?

1712
01:19:31,961 --> 01:19:33,750
And isn't that,
isn't that

1713
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:36,100
or jurisdiction where there's a lot of 
lawsuits based on the,

1714
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,060
you know,
the Occidental College one,

1715
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,333
you know,
that one where a guy and a girl were 

1716
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:41,930
exchanging text messages.
Uh,

1717
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:43,140
she says,
uh,

1718
01:19:43,141 --> 01:19:44,840
you bring condoms?
He says,

1719
01:19:44,841 --> 01:19:46,100
yeah,
I got condoms.

1720
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:47,990
Okay,
they're ready to get laid.

1721
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:48,560
She says,
uh,

1722
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,730
she texts,
her friend says,

1723
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:52,250
I'm about to get laid.
They have sex,

1724
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:55,550
and he gets kicked out for sexual 
assault because he's drunk.

1725
01:19:55,551 --> 01:19:57,950
And she's drunk so he gets kicked out of
school,

1726
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:01,250
she stays in the school and he's the,
he's the perpetrator.

1727
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,113
But meanwhile there's so much evidence 
that they're both just young kids who 

1728
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:08,310
got drunk and fuck.
There you go it into a life and his life

1729
01:20:08,311 --> 01:20:09,144
is ruined.
Let's.

1730
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:10,043
He's suing the shit out of him and I 
hope he gets enough money so I can live 

1731
01:20:12,151 --> 01:20:13,830
in a Jay z video for the rest of his 
life.

1732
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:15,330
Fuck them.
You know,

1733
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:16,173
like look,
every like any God damn person who has 

1734
01:20:18,331 --> 01:20:22,950
ever been 18 or however old these people
were and been away from your parents for

1735
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:27,650
the first time and been drunk and hooked
up with a girl like you,

1736
01:20:27,651 --> 01:20:28,490
you,
you don't know.

1737
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,393
There's nothing evil going on there.
This is like two people that want to be 

1738
01:20:31,981 --> 01:20:35,160
together to get together.
Like to call that rape in any way,

1739
01:20:35,161 --> 01:20:36,810
shape or form is.
That's crazy.

1740
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:37,640
Well,
how about,

1741
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,210
how about this though,
but see that,

1742
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:40,044
I agree with you,
but that's so different than pussy 

1743
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:42,024
grabbing,
man.

1744
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:44,940
Pussy grabbing and pushing people up 
against the wall and kissing him.

1745
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,103
That is way more a salty sea.
That's way more violation of your 

1746
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:49,940
physical space.
Gray.

1747
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:52,020
See,
like if a big guy did that to me,

1748
01:20:52,021 --> 01:20:53,840
if a big guy just grabbed me and kissed 
me and be like,

1749
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,380
oh my God,
motherfucker,

1750
01:20:55,381 --> 01:20:56,160
what do I do?

1751
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,990
I don't want this guy to kill me.
You know,

1752
01:20:57,991 --> 01:21:01,260
it's some giant seven foot tall,
350 pound dude wants to kiss you.

1753
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:02,243
That's what it's like.
I'm sure a woman and a guy like trump 

1754
01:21:04,141 --> 01:21:04,951
grabs you.
That's right.

1755
01:21:04,951 --> 01:21:05,784
Now,
if you're a dude and you're into having 

1756
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:10,500
big dudes grab you and kiss you,
you like fucking bonus.

1757
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:11,783
I nailed it today.
But I'm saying that if there is a 

1758
01:21:14,581 --> 01:21:16,740
movement to again,
that the enemy is.

1759
01:21:16,741 --> 01:21:21,741
There's a movement to lump all behavior 
under the same sort of dark.

1760
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,210
See,
I don't think there is,

1761
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,083
man.
I think there's a movement to make 

1762
01:21:24,721 --> 01:21:27,870
people more aware of behavior like that.
Hold on.

1763
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,360
How about this?
This is where I think things get crazy.

1764
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:32,220
A woman has sex,
she gets drunk,

1765
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:37,200
she has sex with a guy,
and then she speaks to somebody who says

1766
01:21:37,201 --> 01:21:37,800
you were drunk.

1767
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,750
Um,
and do you have regrets about it?

1768
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,220
I have regrets about it.
Well,

1769
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:44,730
if you have regrets then that that's 
rape.

1770
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:45,833
Now somebody says that to her and she 
goes to a committee in her school who 

1771
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:54,621
does an investigation and now you're 
being investigated because this girl has

1772
01:21:54,871 --> 01:21:55,980
regrets.
Six months later,

1773
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,220
this is where,
in my opinion,

1774
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,293
madness starts to this very scary.
It's very scary because now you've got 

1775
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:08,540
have mob mentality over there.
It's all he's hearsay the guy.

1776
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:10,530
The worst thing that can be branded as a
sex criminal.

1777
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:11,423
My God,
I ruined your whole fucking life and 

1778
01:22:12,301 --> 01:22:13,134
it's easy to get.
The distinction you have to do is have 

1779
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:16,530
one person who hates you,
accuse you of.

1780
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,610
There you go.
Bam.

1781
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,580
So now what?
So,

1782
01:22:18,581 --> 01:22:19,414
so I'm just saying we better start 
making these distinctions are mines 

1783
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,833
forget that.
That's where the white nights will step 

1784
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:27,060
in and say what is most important is 
women safety.

1785
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:28,043
And if I have to be wrongly accused,
I had a conversation with a guy who 

1786
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:33,630
actually said that on a podcast.
He said that if,

1787
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:34,523
if he was wrongly accused,
that he would be happier with that than 

1788
01:22:39,361 --> 01:22:42,300
with a woman facing some sort of sexual 
assault,

1789
01:22:42,301 --> 01:22:44,550
which is this first of all,
as if they're in any way,

1790
01:22:44,551 --> 01:22:46,430
shape or form connected.
Personally,

1791
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:47,403
it goes back to my point,
wrongly accused means you have a shitty 

1792
01:22:49,021 --> 01:22:52,110
system and someone lied like it 
shouldn't.

1793
01:22:52,111 --> 01:22:54,630
That shouldn't be the case at all,
but that it shouldn't be an option.

1794
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,580
That goes back to my point.
You're not gonna.

1795
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:59,250
You're not going to liberate women by 
falsely accusing.

1796
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:00,203
Men were so.
This guy's like signing up to be the 

1797
01:23:03,361 --> 01:23:06,370
diminished party signing up to be the 
more vulnerable parts.

1798
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,320
I'll take the hit,
take the hit.

1799
01:23:08,321 --> 01:23:09,550
I'm a white knight.
Yeah,

1800
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:10,413
it is a light,
but it's also not happening to him when 

1801
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:15,430
he's talking about it because it was 
happening.

1802
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:16,263
You'd be freaking out screaming your 
innocence from a rooftop yelling about 

1803
01:23:19,451 --> 01:23:20,284
how you used to be a feminist because I 
can't believe this is happening because 

1804
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:23,400
10 injustice.
Yeah,

1805
01:23:23,401 --> 01:23:27,100
it is an injustice,
but there's a gang of injustices there.

1806
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:31,270
The grabbing and the pussy grabbing,
that's an injustice to write.

1807
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:33,190
It's just like what's.
Where's the level?

1808
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:36,820
And I think one thing as men that it's 
easy to think of is,

1809
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:37,753
is it's,
it's easy to forget that when you're a 

1810
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:41,464
chick,
there's a whole nother element when 

1811
01:23:44,081 --> 01:23:47,410
you're dealing with men and that element
is size,

1812
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,940
strength,
and even though violence is five,

1813
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:54,220
highly unlikely in any work place 
scenario,

1814
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:55,563
you still feel like if you're.
Your body knows that if the shit went 

1815
01:23:58,961 --> 01:24:00,970
down,
Donald Trump could choke you to death.

1816
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:02,440
Yeah.
Don't,

1817
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,270
don't you think your body would know 
that?

1818
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,810
Not only does your body know that,
but women all around you.

1819
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:08,020
If he grabbed you,
he's bigger than you.

1820
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:08,933
You know that,
right?

1821
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:10,043
Yeah.
He grabbed you in wanting to kiss you 

1822
01:24:11,081 --> 01:24:11,914
and just grabbed you and kiss you.
Would that be assault if he grabbed you 

1823
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:15,740
and him alone?
He grabs you,

1824
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:16,930
grabs you.
Package.

1825
01:24:17,490 --> 01:24:19,070
Yeah,
and he shoved his tongue down.

1826
01:24:19,071 --> 01:24:20,650
Usually pins you up against walls.
That assault.

1827
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:22,900
Yeah.
I beat his ass though.

1828
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:26,980
What of your heart?
God got me confused.

1829
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,470
And what does he smell?
Good does he,

1830
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:30,790
does he have trump breath?
I think,

1831
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:31,923
I think you're totally right about these
committees in campuses and universities 

1832
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:36,993
and I also think there's a real problem 
and telling young kids are victims when 

1833
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:41,920
they might not necessarily be victims 
that you know,

1834
01:24:41,921 --> 01:24:42,460
you,
you,

1835
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:46,000
you enforce this sort of victim 
mentality and then you get people really

1836
01:24:46,001 --> 01:24:46,834
hooked on outrage,
getting hooked on outrage as opposed to 

1837
01:24:48,911 --> 01:24:51,850
getting hooked on acceptance and working
on your own,

1838
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,430
your own self and your own thing and 
your own issues,

1839
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:56,590
but you're also taking power away from 
women when you do that.

1840
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:57,760
So,
so what he's saying is that,

1841
01:24:57,761 --> 01:24:58,594
okay,
so women have to be protected at all 

1842
01:24:59,771 --> 01:25:02,710
costs and that's the most important 
thing.

1843
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:05,410
And I,
I will be there,

1844
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:06,363
I will have legislation there,
I will have committees there and all of 

1845
01:25:08,891 --> 01:25:09,724
us are going to protect women on campus 
and because they can't protect 

1846
01:25:13,151 --> 01:25:14,080
themselves,
they can't,

1847
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:14,943
they can't look out for danger.
They can't see because I win in most of 

1848
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:19,990
the time.
Know that what?

1849
01:25:19,991 --> 01:25:22,510
Even a 100 men are safe.
There's always one seminar.

1850
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:25,510
Let me stop you there because here's.
We're going to go back and forth because

1851
01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:27,790
you and I agree on this,
but here's the question.

1852
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:31,420
All right.
How do you stop campus sexual assault?

1853
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:32,463
Now that we know that there's a lot of 
it where they're trying to stop or 

1854
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:38,080
getting people in trouble for shit 
that's not really sexual assault,

1855
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,093
but we also know that there's a lot of 
guys that are fucking douchebags and 

1856
01:25:42,191 --> 01:25:44,620
guaranteed someone's going to get drunk.
It's happened before.

1857
01:25:44,621 --> 01:25:46,470
They've caught them on tape or people 
are passed down.

1858
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,460
There's a train of dudes out the 
bedroom.

1859
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:51,460
How do you stop people from doing shit 
like that?

1860
01:25:51,461 --> 01:25:52,294
That's the real question.
It's not like accusing more people 

1861
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,073
because then you're going to get people 
that are even more frustrated with the 

1862
01:25:58,661 --> 01:25:59,494
opposite sex.
If you find out that guys are getting 

1863
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:03,740
locked up in jail for doing the exact 
same thing,

1864
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:04,280
their girlfriend

1865
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,113
was both being drunk and both having sex
and the guy all of a sudden is a sexual 

1866
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:10,370
Predator because he's drunk.
There are two ways to do it.

1867
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:14,060
The first is you raise awareness,
but that the second is you.

1868
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:16,130
You learn we're not to place your 
energy.

1869
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:17,143
You learn.
We're not to be pointing your guns 

1870
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:21,580
because when you do the other,
when you diminish,

1871
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:23,270
yeah,
you,

1872
01:26:23,290 --> 01:26:24,123
you are not making the problem better.
So we're wasting a lot of time and 

1873
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:29,290
energy in by,
by,

1874
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:34,320
by sort of condemning and going after 
this ankle when we should be like,

1875
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:35,500
what,
what?

1876
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,250
It goes back to what does that wonderful
saying?

1877
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:38,084
I don't care what you think.
It's how you think that what's more 

1878
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:41,840
important is not what you think,
but how you think.

1879
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:45,500
It's like a woman says,
these radical Islamists are bastards and

1880
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:46,480
my opinion,
you know,

1881
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:47,960
we should just eradicate all of them.

1882
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,490
Well,
you sound like a Nazi.

1883
01:26:49,491 --> 01:26:51,530
You're thinking the way,
not the Nazis and nicest.

1884
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:54,470
You're thinking exactly how your enemy 
and the person you're criticizing us.

1885
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:56,630
So it's really methodology here.
Hey,

1886
01:26:56,631 --> 01:26:57,464
you would know this.
This is a good question for you because 

1887
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:03,500
somebody said when he wrote this the 
other day about how when we call Isis,

1888
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:04,783
um,
when we first started having conflicts 

1889
01:27:06,651 --> 01:27:11,540
in the Middle East after the Iraq war,
it's a Sunni and Shia in Iraq,

1890
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:14,870
and then there's all these other groups 
and factions,

1891
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:15,793
the Taliban,
there's al Qaeda and there's a Boko 

1892
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:19,920
Haram,
there's all these different factors.

1893
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:20,803
We sort of kind of lumped them all 
together and decided they were one big 

1894
01:27:23,661 --> 01:27:24,770
enemy.
That's a fact.

1895
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:26,723
And I want you to say this,
like that guy and the drug commercial 

1896
01:27:28,261 --> 01:27:30,200
that's eating the salad and the guy 
goes.

1897
01:27:30,201 --> 01:27:33,230
So you're saying that if I buy drugs or 
support terrorism,

1898
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:34,611
so,
so,

1899
01:27:34,611 --> 01:27:36,020
so,
so she,

1900
01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:40,490
the fact that I,
I think to draw the distinction though,

1901
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:41,870
Taliban,
what is Talib?

1902
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,110
It means student.
So if you're a Taliban,

1903
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,730
you're a student of the Koran,
you know,

1904
01:27:46,731 --> 01:27:48,370
you're a student,
uh,

1905
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:50,510
uh,
al Qaeda.

1906
01:27:50,511 --> 01:27:51,344
Okay.
That means the base loosely translated 

1907
01:27:53,571 --> 01:27:54,650
sort of.
This is the base.

1908
01:27:54,651 --> 01:27:58,280
This is as now.
Is this what they call themselves a?

1909
01:27:58,281 --> 01:27:59,390
I believe they do,
yes.

1910
01:27:59,391 --> 01:28:00,224
I think these were,
these were names that were given to 

1911
01:28:01,821 --> 01:28:05,120
themselves and then,
and then a Boko Haram.

1912
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:08,510
Haram in Arabic means a bad,
like you say,

1913
01:28:08,511 --> 01:28:09,344
like an Arabic.
A lot of times when something happens 

1914
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:11,510
that's bad,
you always say you had,

1915
01:28:11,511 --> 01:28:12,590
um,
you know,

1916
01:28:12,591 --> 01:28:13,790
like that's fucked up,
you know,

1917
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:17,570
almost.
So Boko Haram is sort of a slang,

1918
01:28:17,970 --> 01:28:18,803
I believe,
loosely translated idea that everything 

1919
01:28:20,901 --> 01:28:22,880
western is bad.
Whoa,

1920
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:24,320
okay.
That's outrageous.

1921
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:25,453
And it also part of those folks drugs.
It also has happens to be the fact then 

1922
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,860
the case that these are all Islamic 
movements,

1923
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:34,813
but when you say Islamic movements,
be careful because what you're really 

1924
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:38,030
talking about is puritanical.

1925
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:40,280
The notion that there is a puritanical 
strain.

1926
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:41,114
There's only one form of Islam and that 
Islam is the Islam that the prophet 

1927
01:28:44,691 --> 01:28:47,060
preached in the what,
what century is it?

1928
01:28:47,061 --> 01:28:49,820
The 13th or 15th or whatever it is.
So,

1929
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:52,190
um,
that is,

1930
01:28:52,191 --> 01:28:53,024
if there's any glue to those groups,
it is that they essentially adhere to a 

1931
01:28:57,681 --> 01:28:58,514
very strident,
puritanical form of Islam with no room 

1932
01:29:02,611 --> 01:29:03,444
for interpretation.
There is only right and wrong and they 

1933
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:11,520
are willing to resort to what they would
consider to be jihad,

1934
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:14,370
which the root of which means struggle,
but then what they,

1935
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,010
what they considered to be,
you know,

1936
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,250
violence isn't,
is a,

1937
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:18,084
is a,
is the only option and Islam must sail 

1938
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:23,580
in a sea of blood because that's the 
only way it happens.

1939
01:29:23,581 --> 01:29:25,880
So there's all this sort of idea that,
you know,

1940
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,200
will use the slave fix that.
So,

1941
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:28,531
so,
so,

1942
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:30,630
so that again,
what is that?

1943
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:32,970
That's an idea.
It's an ideology.

1944
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:34,583
You have to kill the bad guys,
but you also have to win the workplace 

1945
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:37,700
of ideas.
I mean the battlefield,

1946
01:29:37,730 --> 01:29:39,720
the battlefield of ideas,
that's very important.

1947
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:40,554
Not only that,
when the casualties are so one sided in 

1948
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:43,434
terms of like all of it is taking place 
in one part of the world versus in our 

1949
01:29:46,561 --> 01:29:47,394
part of the world where we're engaging 
in a completely different spot in the 

1950
01:29:49,531 --> 01:29:51,810
country.
It makes martyrs,

1951
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:52,673
you know,
it makes a lot of people get excited 

1952
01:29:54,031 --> 01:29:55,510
about joining the cause.
They,

1953
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,740
they see the imbalance and the conflict.
They also see.

1954
01:29:58,741 --> 01:29:59,574
They also see though that when they go 
through Istanbul airport and they get 

1955
01:30:02,551 --> 01:30:05,640
into Syria and they die really quickly,
that it's,

1956
01:30:05,641 --> 01:30:06,050
uh,
it's,

1957
01:30:06,050 --> 01:30:08,520
they're starting to realize very quickly
that it's also a death sentence.

1958
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,110
You don't want to fuck with the 
peshmerga.

1959
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:11,460
You don't want to fuck with,
you know,

1960
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,440
the American Special Forces.
I mean,

1961
01:30:13,441 --> 01:30:17,250
these guys are just getting.
And now the Russians in you're,

1962
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:20,670
you're asking for if you want to join 
isol now,

1963
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:24,570
please go ahead and have a real issue 
with isis and Eisele a key.

1964
01:30:24,571 --> 01:30:26,310
They keep changing their name back and 
forth,

1965
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:27,900
uh,
wasn't,

1966
01:30:27,901 --> 01:30:30,390
uh,
it wasn't Isi at one point in time.

1967
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:33,090
I still state right?
It means the,

1968
01:30:33,091 --> 01:30:34,320
uh,
too many,

1969
01:30:34,321 --> 01:30:36,170
um,
too many different isis.

1970
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,370
This stick with one year,
a new band.

1971
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:39,780
They want to create a challenge.
Your name,

1972
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:40,820
they want credit,
caliphate,

1973
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:42,810
you know,
they want to create an Islamic state,

1974
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:44,850
which means there are no those 
boundaries.

1975
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,380
Syria,
remember Lebanon,

1976
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:48,180
those were British boundaries.
Those were,

1977
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:52,020
those were created by the British after 
World War One a,

1978
01:30:52,021 --> 01:30:54,210
in some cases world war two,
but for the most part,

1979
01:30:54,211 --> 01:30:56,190
those are British boundaries.
Not so recent.

1980
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:57,960
Think about how recent that is,
folks.

1981
01:30:57,990 --> 01:30:59,460
Very recent.
It's ridiculous.

1982
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,590
That's not even a hundred years.
It's nothing.

1983
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:02,543
I think that the problem with Islamic 
fundamentalism is not as much a worry 

1984
01:31:04,551 --> 01:31:05,384
because they're not offering anything.
Communism had a something that lasts 

1985
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,473
that that ideology lasted 70 years,
but I think it lasted so long because 

1986
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:16,410
communism was something that you could 
kind of.

1987
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:20,220
There was a compassionate element to it,
you know,

1988
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:22,200
don't believe in God,
believe in reason,

1989
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:25,290
and let's live on communes and all share
and be nice to each other.

1990
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:26,303
That idea is pretty potent and 
especially the young people who are 

1991
01:31:29,971 --> 01:31:33,150
trying to figure the world out and who 
love each other and any sanders.

1992
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:35,430
Yeah.
I'm Goddamn Kami.

1993
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:36,271
Right.
Well,

1994
01:31:36,271 --> 01:31:39,180
he's definitely a social thing to Bernie
sanders stepped in right now.

1995
01:31:39,181 --> 01:31:41,970
He would win.
Like if he ran as an independent,

1996
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:42,780
it'd be like,
look,

1997
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:45,390
I can't let you people do this.
Fuck the Democrats.

1998
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:48,150
I'm going independent.
You don't need the libertarian.

1999
01:31:48,151 --> 01:31:49,470
They don't know what they're doing.
I can do this.

2000
01:31:49,471 --> 01:31:52,350
We could figure this out folks.
This is a disaster tooled.

2001
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:53,873
How dare you.
It just looks a little up in step in 

2002
01:31:55,411 --> 01:31:56,880
right now.
Has Got Shitty posture.

2003
01:31:56,881 --> 01:31:58,740
He needs one of those neck things.
You're hanging from the doorway.

2004
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:00,190
Yeah.
He looks too old

2005
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:03,430
and he's just to please man,
don't forget about what he looks like.

2006
01:32:03,431 --> 01:32:06,700
He almost got in.
He got real close look,

2007
01:32:06,701 --> 01:32:07,500
man.
Uh,

2008
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:11,180
I think also that Bernie Sanders,
how dare he say such horrible things.

2009
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:12,530
He's,
he's,

2010
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:14,110
he's pretty.
He's,

2011
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:15,003
he's,
um,

2012
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:19,480
I just think people.
He's not very presidential and plead the

2013
01:32:19,481 --> 01:32:24,070
presidency is a symbolic post as well.
It's very much a symbolic post.

2014
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:25,870
What would you listen to what you just 
said?

2015
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:27,750
He's too old.
He's tall.

2016
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:30,640
He's too old looking.
He doesn't seem very presidential.

2017
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,260
That's what the electric say.
Well,

2018
01:32:32,261 --> 01:32:33,880
why?
Why would you say that though?

2019
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:35,080
Well,
that's what I'm saying.

2020
01:32:35,081 --> 01:32:35,914
That's when would,
when you don't think that if he stepped 

2021
01:32:38,591 --> 01:32:41,020
in now as an independent,
that he'd have a real chance.

2022
01:32:41,021 --> 01:32:41,854
At the very least,
he would confuse the fuck out of the 

2023
01:32:43,361 --> 01:32:44,194
system because there's a giant movement 
of people that wanted to see him in 

2024
01:32:46,541 --> 01:32:47,030
place.

2025
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:49,030
You want to see him as democratic 
representative.

2026
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:50,043
Yeah.
And those people be super energized if 

2027
01:32:50,861 --> 01:32:52,150
he did step in.
I Dunno.

2028
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:53,830
I Dunno.
I Dunno about that.

2029
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:55,390
Oh Wow.
I don't know.

2030
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:56,303
I think for sure for sure.
I think there's still a giant movement 

2031
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:01,690
of people out there that love that guy 
and loved that he was.

2032
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:03,790
He seemed to be like a guy who wasn't 
greedy.

2033
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:05,560
He seemed to be a guy who wasn't 
corrupt.

2034
01:33:05,561 --> 01:33:06,394
Like how is this possible?
I don't think he is cropped and I don't 

2035
01:33:07,601 --> 01:33:09,250
think.
I don't think he is either.

2036
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,310
But that was.
That's the number one issue with someone

2037
01:33:12,311 --> 01:33:13,144
like the Clintons.
And then the thing is that everybody 

2038
01:33:14,531 --> 01:33:15,880
thinks that that's the only way to do 
it.

2039
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:17,450
Like the,
the what,

2040
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:18,613
what people that support the left.
The people that are really into being 

2041
01:33:21,431 --> 01:33:22,264
Democrats,
they have this thing that they've sort 

2042
01:33:24,281 --> 01:33:26,050
of resigned themselves to,
hey,

2043
01:33:26,051 --> 01:33:26,950
this is politics.

2044
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:29,200
This is how they do it.
This is politics as usual.

2045
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:30,373
When,
when you have an example of a guy like 

2046
01:33:31,331 --> 01:33:32,111
Bernie Sanders,
you go,

2047
01:33:32,111 --> 01:33:32,440
well,
no,

2048
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,680
it doesn't have to be like,
look at that guy like that guy didn't do

2049
01:33:35,681 --> 01:33:36,730
it.
Cal Come.

2050
01:33:36,731 --> 01:33:38,980
They have to do this,
they have to get that money to speak.

2051
01:33:38,981 --> 01:33:41,080
They have to do all this shit.
They have to talk to the banks.

2052
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,333
They have to.
Are you sure they have to or is it just 

2053
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:44,943
this is what the.
The people that do the things that you 

2054
01:33:47,111 --> 01:33:49,300
liked the most.
They also do these things.

2055
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,950
Is that okay?
That's okay for you,

2056
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:55,570
but sometimes I think that that things 
start to happen by default,

2057
01:33:55,571 --> 01:33:56,404
so if you started,
let's just say we we could return to 

2058
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:02,260
kind of scramble everything up and go 
back to set point zero.

2059
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:07,090
I feel like in 30 years we'd be right 
back to where we started.

2060
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:08,920
Like somebody talking about factory 
farming.

2061
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,073
It's talking to a guy who has been in 
the food business forever and I was 

2062
01:34:12,131 --> 01:34:14,470
talking about.
There's a book called the tornado effect

2063
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:15,833
about when how food flavoring.
When scientists figured out how to make 

2064
01:34:18,761 --> 01:34:22,810
a corn chip tastes like a Taco,
it kind of changed everything because we

2065
01:34:22,811 --> 01:34:26,110
were able to isolate flavors.
There was a machine that allowed us to.

2066
01:34:26,111 --> 01:34:28,690
Because we didn't know why strawberry 
tastes like a strawberry on ours,

2067
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:30,810
tastes like an orange,
but um,

2068
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:33,310
and I had this guy on my podcast on the 
Brian Council and,

2069
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:34,440
and uh,
the,

2070
01:34:34,441 --> 01:34:35,274
the,
the guy who writes this book about how 

2071
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:41,971
food flavoring changed the way we ate 
and it ended up,

2072
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:47,190
it allowed us to take very non 
nutritious food and make it nutritious.

2073
01:34:48,030 --> 01:34:50,160
Trying to figure out how you're gonna 
bring this back to factory farming.

2074
01:34:50,161 --> 01:34:54,790
If we ended up and he was talking about 
how we need to get back to sort of,

2075
01:34:54,791 --> 01:34:57,200
you know,
family farming and farming and stuff.

2076
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:57,980
But I

2077
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,480
talked to this guy who was in the food 
business.

2078
01:34:59,481 --> 01:34:59,991
He said,
you know,

2079
01:34:59,991 --> 01:35:00,824
the problem with that is that family 
farms are a great idea and we do 

2080
01:35:03,621 --> 01:35:07,040
probably need more family farms,
but what would happen is probably in the

2081
01:35:07,050 --> 01:35:09,080
next 20 years we'd be back to factory 
farming.

2082
01:35:09,081 --> 01:35:09,651
I said,
what do you mean?

2083
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:10,484
He said what would happen is that some 
farms wouldn't be as efficient or they 

2084
01:35:13,851 --> 01:35:16,370
wouldn't be as good and in another farms
better and that farm and say,

2085
01:35:16,371 --> 01:35:18,500
let me buy you a farm.
I do a better job,

2086
01:35:18,530 --> 01:35:20,060
and then that he'd say,
let me buy this farm,

2087
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:20,894
and then he had all of a sudden he'd buy
all the farms in this area because he's 

2088
01:35:22,191 --> 01:35:25,820
really good at organization automation 
and everything else and that would start

2089
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:26,654
to happen.
Then a bigger company to come along and 

2090
01:35:27,531 --> 01:35:28,790
say,
let me buy all your farms,

2091
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:29,643
man,
you've got market share here and I can 

2092
01:35:30,621 --> 01:35:32,840
do this even better because there's a 
better way to do it.

2093
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:33,673
Not only that,
keep the prices stable because we're 

2094
01:35:35,841 --> 01:35:36,674
going to have a lot of eggs.
So when I hop I have doesn't have to 

2095
01:35:39,261 --> 01:35:40,011
say,
well today,

2096
01:35:40,011 --> 01:35:40,844
since we only get our,
our eggs from a local source today 

2097
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,900
they're the eggs are $5.
Whereas yesterday were three 99.

2098
01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:47,983
That's kind of what would happen because
it would depend on production and 

2099
01:35:51,281 --> 01:35:53,960
distribution.
And so he was kind of saying,

2100
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:54,823
you know,
it's nice to think that we need family 

2101
01:35:56,451 --> 01:35:57,284
farming,
but chances are with such a huge 

2102
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:02,450
population that we have to feed the way 
we do it as quickly as we do,

2103
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:04,670
we'd probably be back to,
hey,

2104
01:36:04,671 --> 01:36:05,504
we're running out of chickens who can 
make a chicken that can mature in six 

2105
01:36:07,041 --> 01:36:08,330
weeks.
Well that's the big issue.

2106
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:12,170
The big issue is the population and a 
big issue

2107
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:15,420
will do their best,
you know,

2108
01:36:15,421 --> 01:36:16,254
they do their best to recycle.
They do their best to try to figure out 

2109
01:36:19,531 --> 01:36:20,364
how to pollute the least and consume the
least and leave the smallest carbon 

2110
01:36:23,581 --> 01:36:25,320
footprint.
And some people are very conscious about

2111
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:26,154
it.
But there's a lot of things that people 

2112
01:36:27,391 --> 01:36:30,900
overlook and one of them is all the 
vegetables that you get from the grocery

2113
01:36:30,901 --> 01:36:32,940
store,
no matter what,

2114
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:33,953
if you think you are somehow or another 
Karma free because you're only eating 

2115
01:36:36,361 --> 01:36:37,710
vegetables.
Man,

2116
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:38,663
I hate to tell you,
but that whole thing of growing 

2117
01:36:41,101 --> 01:36:41,934
vegetables in mass is only slightly less
controversial than growing animals in 

2118
01:36:47,341 --> 01:36:48,960
mass.
It's all weird.

2119
01:36:48,990 --> 01:36:51,060
There's a lot of displacement.
Wildlife.

2120
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:53,880
There's a lot of pollution of the 
environment due to pesticides,

2121
01:36:53,881 --> 01:36:55,980
the runoff from the salt and sea that I 
was telling you about.

2122
01:36:56,310 --> 01:37:00,410
That's all directly attributed to 
farming and most of it is agriculture.

2123
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:02,370
It's great.
It's fucking pesticides and shit.

2124
01:37:02,371 --> 01:37:07,020
It all flows down down river and you're 
fucked and there's a lot of other issues

2125
01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:09,330
like first of all,
it's not natural.

2126
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:11,640
It's not natural to keep growing things 
in one spot.

2127
01:37:11,670 --> 01:37:13,890
That is just not how the world is 
supposed to be designed.

2128
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:15,023
It's supposed to be a gigantic cycle of 
animals dying and their bodies rotting 

2129
01:37:20,111 --> 01:37:23,520
and their bodies fueling the plants that
they actually eat,

2130
01:37:23,521 --> 01:37:28,260
and then animals eat them and they die 
and their bodies rod and fuel the plants

2131
01:37:28,261 --> 01:37:31,140
that grow around them.
We've circumvented that thing with these

2132
01:37:31,141 --> 01:37:31,974
giant things we call cities.
We figured out a way to stack all these 

2133
01:37:34,831 --> 01:37:35,664
people on top of each other and then we 
had to figure out a way to get them all 

2134
01:37:37,441 --> 01:37:41,190
food because the fucking buildings kept 
growing and the people kept needing more

2135
01:37:41,191 --> 01:37:43,740
and more and more and they're running 
out of room fuck.

2136
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:47,700
And so that's the problem,
the problem is we got the cart way ahead

2137
01:37:47,701 --> 01:37:50,040
of the train,
we're what we're way ahead of it.

2138
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:51,083
And we didn't,
we didn't anticipate for 7 billion 

2139
01:37:52,981 --> 01:37:53,814
people,
we didn't anticipate for 300 million 

2140
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:55,980
Americans and

2141
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:00,090
we're kind of doing it right now,
but even with our vegetables,

2142
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:03,330
we're fucking up giant chunks of land,
you know,

2143
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:08,390
even with our vegetables.
And do you think it's not easy like this

2144
01:38:08,461 --> 01:38:12,810
idea that it's easy to feed a bunch of 
people at 20 million people with a Vegan

2145
01:38:12,811 --> 01:38:13,990
Diet?
Goddammit,

2146
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:14,963
it's not,
it's not easy to feed 20 million people 

2147
01:38:16,171 --> 01:38:21,171
with any kind of diet and it requires a 
lot of resources and organization and,

2148
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,330
and you know,
sort of consolidation.

2149
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:25,480
Yeah.
No,

2150
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:28,980
but I would imagine it's not saying 
factory farming from animals is awesome.

2151
01:38:28,981 --> 01:38:29,814
It's disgusting.
It's scary that it got this far and he 

2152
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:33,810
got this far while we weren't paying 
attention to it,

2153
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:37,890
all of us.
I think pretty much all Americans at one

2154
01:38:37,891 --> 01:38:40,660
point in their life had to be told of 
factory farming.

2155
01:38:40,661 --> 01:38:41,760
And then when,
what the fuck,

2156
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:44,490
like this wasn't something that was 
discussed when we were in high school.

2157
01:38:44,730 --> 01:38:45,563
When I was in college,
there was never a word and I was barely 

2158
01:38:47,851 --> 01:38:48,684
in college by the way,
but when I was in college were the same 

2159
01:38:54,391 --> 01:38:56,250
age.
That's what I'm.

2160
01:38:56,440 --> 01:39:00,150
What I'm saying is no one discussed it.
It wasn't this gigantic issue.

2161
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:03,130
I don't think we were quite as aware.
That's another creepy things.

2162
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:03,983
Those AG gag laws were to legal,
to film these horrific conditions that 

2163
01:39:07,771 --> 01:39:10,680
pigs Robert concerns have to live in.
That's you can.

2164
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:11,543
You can go to jail for letting people 
know about animal torture that's being 

2165
01:39:15,121 --> 01:39:18,300
taken place where they're hitting a 
fucking cow in the head with a wrench.

2166
01:39:18,301 --> 01:39:21,230
I saw this crazy video of this guy 
crowbars a cow in the head.

2167
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:26,010
The first time I ever saw the first time
I ever learned about factory farming was

2168
01:39:26,011 --> 01:39:26,844
there as a pamphlet in my college and 
they were talking about how smart pigs 

2169
01:39:29,911 --> 01:39:30,750
are and how they.

2170
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:31,693
They.
They showed a picture of a pig chewing 

2171
01:39:32,971 --> 01:39:37,350
the bars independent within and how pigs
go crazy because they want to roam with.

2172
01:39:37,351 --> 01:39:38,184
They're too smart to just sit in that 
pen and I got so claustrophobic that I 

2173
01:39:41,071 --> 01:39:43,140
didn't eat bacon for a year out of 
compassion.

2174
01:39:43,141 --> 01:39:45,270
I was like,
I can't eat bacon now to Kenny Baker.

2175
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:46,690
And then he was right back on the big 
show.

2176
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:48,480
And then I read a book called fit for 
life,

2177
01:39:48,481 --> 01:39:52,680
which was all about being a vegetarian.
Try that for about six days.

2178
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:54,810
Didn't work for me.
I just can't do it.

2179
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,930
Well,
vegetarian is way more healthy than just

2180
01:39:57,931 --> 01:40:00,570
going straight Vegan.
As far as like own,

2181
01:40:00,590 --> 01:40:01,423
I say way more healthy,
meaning that it's easier to be waiting 

2182
01:40:03,361 --> 01:40:05,490
on healthy.
Like you can pull off the Vegan thing if

2183
01:40:05,491 --> 01:40:06,324
you're super on the ball with your 
essential fats and you make sure you 

2184
01:40:09,571 --> 01:40:10,680
take,
what is it,

2185
01:40:10,681 --> 01:40:12,830
Dah da.
And there's a pet.

2186
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:13,541
What is the,
the,

2187
01:40:13,541 --> 01:40:14,620
the,
the um,

2188
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:18,090
Omega threes and sixes that you can get 
from the fuck.

2189
01:40:18,091 --> 01:40:23,091
Is that stuff called that you get from a
flag from Kelp?

2190
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,070
Flaxseed,
flaxseed,

2191
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:27,713
flaxseed.
But apparently the biological stuff is 

2192
01:40:30,571 --> 01:40:31,404
better.
There's Omega threes and sixes that you 

2193
01:40:33,141 --> 01:40:35,420
can help an animal though.
No,

2194
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:39,420
it's plant kelp is not thinking about.
I'm thinking about Krill.

2195
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:40,770
Krill.
Oh yeah.

2196
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:41,640
Yeah.
That's an animal.

2197
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:42,001
Well,
you know,

2198
01:40:42,001 --> 01:40:46,770
here's another thing that a Sam Harris 
was telling me is that mollusks,

2199
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:49,290
if you.
At least if you look at them on paper,

2200
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,273
there's more of an argument to be made 
that plants are intelligent than 

2201
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:54,000
molochs.
Really?

2202
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:54,760
Yeah.
Models.

2203
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:57,520
They don't feel shit.
That is a little blobs of snot.

2204
01:40:57,830 --> 01:41:00,820
It is living.
Come live in com that lives in a shell.

2205
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,680
You know,
they're weird.

2206
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:05,440
There's a weird little things and 
apparently they're super,

2207
01:41:05,441 --> 01:41:06,520
super primitive.

2208
01:41:07,090 --> 01:41:11,680
Will all what we decide that they are an
animal that should not be eaten.

2209
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:12,563
Whereas a plant is something that should
be eaten based on whether or not they 

2210
01:41:15,371 --> 01:41:16,260
move.
Wait,

2211
01:41:16,261 --> 01:41:17,700
wait.
What's a scallop death?

2212
01:41:17,701 --> 01:41:19,000
Not the same as a mollusk.
Well,

2213
01:41:19,001 --> 01:41:22,180
this Gallup is a mollusk clams mussels,
scallops.

2214
01:41:22,181 --> 01:41:24,340
There's a lot of different shelled 
organisms,

2215
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:26,290
but they're super,
super,

2216
01:41:26,291 --> 01:41:28,600
super primitive.
I did not have nerve endings.

2217
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:29,381
Like,
yeah,

2218
01:41:29,381 --> 01:41:30,214
they don't feel pain.
Like that's the other thing about 

2219
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:33,260
lobsters.
Lobsters is creeping.

2220
01:41:33,261 --> 01:41:35,560
Where do they are?
Apparently they don't feel pain.

2221
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:36,783
Too primitive to feel pain.
There's a great essay by David Foster 

2222
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,460
Wallace called consider the lobster and 
it's all about this.

2223
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:43,491
Yeah,
I don't know.

2224
01:41:43,491 --> 01:41:47,170
I mean there's a thing called the 
lobster liberation organization to break

2225
01:41:47,171 --> 01:41:50,310
into restaurants and they take lots and 
they throw them back in the ocean.

2226
01:41:50,630 --> 01:41:51,970
What kind of a one?

2227
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:56,050
Kind of a radical group that's trying to
get proof for that group.

2228
01:41:56,170 --> 01:41:58,630
I just want to get that phone call from.
From jail.

2229
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:00,910
I'm in jail.
Which you do.

2230
01:42:00,911 --> 01:42:04,210
So we met from the law to get into a 
fistfight.

2231
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:07,240
What did you read?
This pamphlet would judge me.

2232
01:42:07,241 --> 01:42:08,280
No doubt.
I uh,

2233
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:12,700
I let a lobster free what I let lobsters
free.

2234
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,100
Oh,
those giant Cunty roaches.

2235
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:16,990
That one.
Just bite your fingers off.

2236
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:20,080
You let those things for dummy.
They are members.

2237
01:42:20,081 --> 01:42:22,010
Delicious insect family.
I guess the other they are.

2238
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:25,700
That's why if you eat cricket,
a flower like that,

2239
01:42:25,701 --> 01:42:30,130
it was a thing in protein bars.
If you have an allergy to shellfish,

2240
01:42:30,131 --> 01:42:33,280
you can break out.
And that's so true,

2241
01:42:33,281 --> 01:42:36,250
and I can validate that by fear factor,
fear factor.

2242
01:42:36,251 --> 01:42:37,084
We gave people roaches and one of the 
dudes that we gave roaches was allergic 

2243
01:42:39,251 --> 01:42:40,084
to shellfish.

2244
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:43,020
So when he ate the roaches,
he got sick due to Roche.

2245
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:46,660
Yeah.
It wasn't like very overrated is.

2246
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:47,380
No,
it's not.

2247
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:50,140
It's not terrible.
Tasting is not a big deal.

2248
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:51,063
It wasn't.
It wasn't hard to do hate the body that 

2249
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:54,490
I just.
I had a giant one.

2250
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,950
It was a Madagascar hissing.
Cockroaches.

2251
01:42:57,890 --> 01:42:59,470
Yeah.
It was like a live on that.

2252
01:42:59,471 --> 01:43:00,730
I mean,
could for sure.

2253
01:43:00,731 --> 01:43:01,600
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

2254
01:43:01,601 --> 01:43:03,340
You could live on that same weekend.
Live on crap.

2255
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,740
Where'd you afraid it was going to bite 
you or no?

2256
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:07,360
They don't bite.
That's kid of a bug.

2257
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:08,570
Fuck.
I'm tests of bug,

2258
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:11,410
but poison didn't have poison.
I knew I was going to Jack.

2259
01:43:11,411 --> 01:43:13,420
I'm quick.
Was it dirty in there?

2260
01:43:13,421 --> 01:43:14,110
Yeah,
whenever.

2261
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:16,660
So it a peanut butter and Jelly Sandwich
and drop on the ground.

2262
01:43:16,661 --> 01:43:17,494
If you're hungry,
you pick it up and you just ate a 

2263
01:43:18,521 --> 01:43:20,740
Goddamn cockroach.
Bad Dude.

2264
01:43:20,741 --> 01:43:21,574
People been eating them forever.
We were insectivores probably before we 

2265
01:43:24,341 --> 01:43:26,100
ever figured out how to kill animals.
Fuckers.

2266
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:27,360
Yeah.
Oh look,

2267
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,170
no bond deal,
dude.

2268
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:30,423
It's no big deal.
They'll look at young Joe Rogan was 

2269
01:43:33,161 --> 01:43:35,560
ending that young man.
Full head is fairly young.

2270
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:36,730
Fairly.
C'Mon dude.

2271
01:43:36,731 --> 01:43:37,710
Look at these poor girls.

2272
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,200
Dude.
You just did it.

2273
01:43:41,370 --> 01:43:42,620
It's,
it's not that big.

2274
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:46,030
Show this and let's not even move on 
with this.

2275
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:48,820
You're not really that.
It's um,

2276
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:50,043
I coughed a lot.
There was a lot of little parts and 

2277
01:43:51,801 --> 01:43:53,510
stuff that we're going down the back of 
my throat,

2278
01:43:53,730 --> 01:43:56,150
the whole um,
little legs and shit,

2279
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:57,550
you know,
because it's,

2280
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:01,550
you're chewing up this hard,
hard skeleton and trying to swallow that

2281
01:44:01,551 --> 01:44:03,500
too.
That made me gag a couple of times.

2282
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,990
But as far as like taste,
it's really nothing.

2283
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:09,020
It's like almost like a void of taste 
and Merlin Mann.

2284
01:44:09,030 --> 01:44:12,230
Allah gave me the back of the deer's 
eyeball.

2285
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:13,071
Oh yeah,
that's right.

2286
01:44:13,071 --> 01:44:13,904
It was fat.
And he said to that just like chewing 

2287
01:44:15,531 --> 01:44:16,364
gum.
And I was like,

2288
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:19,160
no.
He said it tastes like dough.

2289
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:20,043
Yeah,
like dough.

2290
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:21,260
Yeah,
like bread dough.

2291
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:23,600
It did SORTA.
It looked like bread dough,

2292
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:26,090
interesting.
Like it's fat behind the eyes.

2293
01:44:26,930 --> 01:44:29,030
While I appreciated the fact that he eat
that too.

2294
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:30,610
He eats everything.
Hell yeah.

2295
01:44:30,630 --> 01:44:33,630
Know that guy has more respect for,
uh,

2296
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:35,690
a downed animal than,
uh,

2297
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:36,980
any,
any hunter of.

2298
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,510
Yeah,
buddy down to dude,

2299
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:40,560
you did I miss.

2300
01:44:41,010 --> 01:44:41,850
Well,
is this a thing?

2301
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:44,160
Here's the other thing,
like everybody can't do that.

2302
01:44:44,190 --> 01:44:45,023
That's a really important point to point
to bring up whenever we're also pro 

2303
01:44:48,931 --> 01:44:49,764
hunting and talking about how great it 
is to eat animals that you've harvested 

2304
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:54,960
yourself,
you know exactly where they came from.

2305
01:44:54,961 --> 01:44:55,950
You.
They're wild.

2306
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:58,080
You know,
they've never been abused and never been

2307
01:44:59,490 --> 01:45:02,010
raised in slavery and Fed antibiotics 
and hormones.

2308
01:45:02,011 --> 01:45:03,840
They lived wild until you shot him.
Yeah.

2309
01:45:03,841 --> 01:45:06,460
But everybody can't do that.
That's,

2310
01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:09,690
there's a problem with that too.
Like even even admitting that,

2311
01:45:09,691 --> 01:45:12,420
like even saying that like for me 
personally,

2312
01:45:12,421 --> 01:45:14,490
it's the better option.
I enjoy that option.

2313
01:45:14,491 --> 01:45:17,640
I think it's the best option.
It's still everybody can't do it,

2314
01:45:17,641 --> 01:45:19,380
so it's,
we're fucked no matter what.

2315
01:45:19,410 --> 01:45:21,330
But we've come a long way with just 
feeding people.

2316
01:45:21,331 --> 01:45:22,860
Half the world was starving in the 
seventies,

2317
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:23,400
of course with.

2318
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,810
We just weren't back to what we're 
saying,

2319
01:45:24,811 --> 01:45:25,950
you know,
factory farming.

2320
01:45:25,951 --> 01:45:27,930
That's how they did it.
I mean they figured out how to do it.

2321
01:45:28,710 --> 01:45:33,030
Large scale agriculture,
indiscriminant combines that chew up the

2322
01:45:33,031 --> 01:45:33,864
amount of animals that die when they 
chew up the fucking grain and corn and 

2323
01:45:37,561 --> 01:45:38,460
all the different things.
They.

2324
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:42,810
It's a fucking horror show.
My friend John Dudley who lives in Iowa,

2325
01:45:42,811 --> 01:45:46,920
he has a farm and he says when they run 
those combines,

2326
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:50,400
when they pick up whatever grains or 
whatever they have,

2327
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:53,310
they run these big giant ass machines 
and he says,

2328
01:45:53,311 --> 01:45:56,430
you'll see the buzzards circling in the 
sky.

2329
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:58,710
Like they literally know that things are
just.

2330
01:45:58,740 --> 01:45:59,573
Oh,
you mean like rats and rabbits and rats 

2331
01:46:01,381 --> 01:46:04,950
and rabbits and deer fons and ground 
nesting birds.

2332
01:46:04,951 --> 01:46:06,030
Fuck,
I never thought of that.

2333
01:46:06,031 --> 01:46:08,790
All those animals don't realize that 
these,

2334
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,980
what they're living in is temporary.

2335
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:11,821
They look at it as,
oh,

2336
01:46:11,821 --> 01:46:14,040
this is an awesome shelter.
I'm going to go in here.

2337
01:46:14,041 --> 01:46:17,310
It's thick with all these branches.
No predators are going to find me.

2338
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:19,950
I'll just go here and nest so,
so that.

2339
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:23,080
Now the green tea,
I've never heard this grain combines.

2340
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:25,090
Have you ever seen a green combine?
Now Jamie,

2341
01:46:25,150 --> 01:46:25,983
Jamie,
pull it up and you'll get an 

2342
01:46:26,311 --> 01:46:27,144
understanding,
an understanding of what kind of volume 

2343
01:46:28,381 --> 01:46:29,430
you're talking about.
So,

2344
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:31,770
so in your bread you're saying with the 
grain,

2345
01:46:31,771 --> 01:46:36,000
because you have a lot of animal.
That's totally that.

2346
01:46:36,270 --> 01:46:37,320
It's not just that,
well,

2347
01:46:37,321 --> 01:46:40,000
I don't know how good it is for you and 
how much of it gets baked off,

2348
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:44,130
but the problem is it's not animal death
free.

2349
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:46,580
It's just not right.
We were showing something.

2350
01:46:46,590 --> 01:46:47,423
Brian put up this video the other day of
a grain silo in Russia and now these 

2351
01:46:51,931 --> 01:46:56,220
pigeons fall into the grain silo and try
to eat the grain.

2352
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:57,053
Then gets sucked into the gears as the 
the silo or the machine is turning up 

2353
01:47:01,891 --> 01:47:02,724
the grain so they land on the grain and 
try to get some of it and then they get 

2354
01:47:04,741 --> 01:47:07,770
sucked into the gears over and over and 
over and over again.

2355
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:08,604
We're launching like 10:15
of them and like of course of a couple 

2356
01:47:10,381 --> 01:47:14,010
of minutes get sucked into this machine 
that chews up the pigeons.

2357
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:14,844
And so.
So when they say what does the machine 

2358
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:19,860
taking the grain and making it finer,
is that what it's doing?

2359
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:21,901
Well,
yeah,

2360
01:47:21,901 --> 01:47:22,770
but let's,
yeah,

2361
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:23,700
well let's not,
let's see.

2362
01:47:23,701 --> 01:47:27,300
A large view so we can get an 
understanding of the mass.

2363
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:29,070
So that's just,
that's a small one.

2364
01:47:29,071 --> 01:47:33,420
Look at large scale grain combine and 
see if you could find a video of it,

2365
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:34,463
but they have these fucking hundreds of 
feet long and they're just chewing up 

2366
01:47:37,711 --> 01:47:38,544
giant chunks of these crops and when 
they're doing these large scale 

2367
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:42,270
agriculture,
like that one right there.

2368
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:43,500
Perfect exam.
But isn't that,

2369
01:47:43,501 --> 01:47:44,334
isn't that just clear cutting?
That's not actually using any of that 

2370
01:47:46,141 --> 01:47:46,500
stuff.
No,

2371
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,660
it's using it.
That's how,

2372
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:49,700
that's how they chew that shit up dude.
Yeah,

2373
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:50,960
but that's not,
that's not a,

2374
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:53,050
that's actually isn't a cornfield.
They,

2375
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:55,890
they pick the corn.
That's actually um,

2376
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:56,813
I believe that's a truck going through 
it and taking out all those they can 

2377
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:01,224
replant.
I think it is possible that that's what 

2378
01:48:02,671 --> 01:48:03,504
that is,
but there's a bunch of different kinds 

2379
01:48:04,801 --> 01:48:07,320
of machines they use for that same kind 
of purpose,

2380
01:48:07,321 --> 01:48:10,350
meaning for whether it's they're just 
going to replant them,

2381
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:11,910
whether it's their harvesting.
Um,

2382
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:16,230
there's got machines running over that 
ground all the time,

2383
01:48:16,231 --> 01:48:18,420
like see if you could find the big 
combines,

2384
01:48:18,421 --> 01:48:22,620
they spread out like a t and it's like,
so there's a truck and then to the right

2385
01:48:22,621 --> 01:48:23,454
and the left,
they spread out on either side with 

2386
01:48:24,901 --> 01:48:25,734
these just years that chopped down the 
plants and then get them ready for 

2387
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:30,960
harvest.

2388
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,660
And they also do it when they're,
um,

2389
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:34,410
when they're making hay,
you know,

2390
01:48:34,411 --> 01:48:37,260
they do that.
They have these machines that they drive

2391
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:39,540
through and chop everything down and 
they roll it up for hey,

2392
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:41,460
like here.
So that's a combine.

2393
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:44,190
And that thing,
as that guy pulls it,

2394
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:48,000
that thing is chewing up every fucking 
thing that's down there.

2395
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:49,073
Everything and animals,
especially Fonz is one of the weird 

2396
01:48:52,831 --> 01:48:55,050
things about deer fonds when they're 
really young,

2397
01:48:55,051 --> 01:48:57,390
they just stay put.
So they,

2398
01:48:57,430 --> 01:48:58,620
uh,
if they hear things,

2399
01:48:58,621 --> 01:48:59,454
you could literally walk up to a baby 
deer fond and if the mom's not around 

2400
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:03,293
you can touch it because their instincts
until they get old enough to run away 

2401
01:49:06,901 --> 01:49:07,734
from stuff,
their instincts are to stay put just to 

2402
01:49:09,571 --> 01:49:10,404
ensure survival.
So a lot of them get chewed up in this 

2403
01:49:13,801 --> 01:49:14,634
and there was some estimation that I 
read when they were talking about the 

2404
01:49:16,951 --> 01:49:17,784
problems with this and the ways they 
were trying to figure out how to 

2405
01:49:20,431 --> 01:49:24,220
mitigate wildlife loss from use of 
indiscriminate combine.

2406
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:25,053
It's like this.
And they were talking about each pound 

2407
01:49:26,761 --> 01:49:29,400
of grain.
How many animals has to die.

2408
01:49:29,550 --> 01:49:30,840
I don't remember what the number was.
Oh,

2409
01:49:30,841 --> 01:49:33,920
this is the video of the pigeons that 
gets shoved into this,

2410
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:36,090
uh,
for the grinder.

2411
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:37,320
Yeah.
Oh Dude.

2412
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:38,880
He goes on forever.
You guys?

2413
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:39,890
Yeah.
Whoops.

2414
01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:42,210
Oh No.
And they keep doing it.

2415
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:45,030
So they're not smart enough to figure 
out what's going on.

2416
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:45,931
Look at that one.
Whoops.

2417
01:49:45,931 --> 01:49:46,764
Oh Shit.
Fuck.

2418
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:48,520
This is insane.
Yeah.

2419
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:51,150
Then this is going away there.
Granted,

2420
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:51,851
fly.
You made it.

2421
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:53,380
You made it to fly.
Well how about that?

2422
01:49:53,381 --> 01:49:55,240
One in the end,
she's just watching his buddies go down.

2423
01:49:55,241 --> 01:49:56,074
He doesn't say a goddamn thing.
One of them jumped right in the middle 

2424
01:49:57,311 --> 01:49:58,144
of was like,
Hey,

2425
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,830
look at this.
It's amazing.

2426
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:02,350
Just flag it.
There you go.

2427
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:04,270
Guys said WHO's going to get smart now?

2428
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:07,330
This one's.
This one's gone.

2429
01:50:07,331 --> 01:50:09,280
Say it dude.
Oh,

2430
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:12,790
last week.
I bet you could make a lot of money.

2431
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:14,890
This is what.
This is a gambler's dream.

2432
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:15,813
I got the one right.
Is this one going to get down and I'd 

2433
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:20,800
have to have stacks of money on the name
of this video.

2434
01:50:20,830 --> 01:50:22,030
Jamie.
Oh Dude,

2435
01:50:22,031 --> 01:50:24,010
you went to facebook exploding.
Oh,

2436
01:50:24,011 --> 01:50:28,330
that's not it.
What was the pigeons are being sucked in

2437
01:50:28,331 --> 01:50:31,930
with the green on a bread making plant 
in Russia.

2438
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:36,270
Russian pity comes up.
Okay man.

2439
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:37,630
You too.
But.

2440
01:50:38,050 --> 01:50:38,883
So the point is to make gigantic groups 
of people happy and fed even just with 

2441
01:50:44,381 --> 01:50:46,570
vegetables.
You need a lot of that stuff going on.

2442
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:49,270
So it's not nice to anybody.
It's not nice.

2443
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:50,650
I mean this is,
again,

2444
01:50:50,651 --> 01:50:51,484
this is not defending factory farming,
which is obviously disgusting and 

2445
01:50:53,591 --> 01:50:54,424
horrible and it's a.
it's one of the darker aspects of human 

2446
01:50:59,141 --> 01:50:59,974
civilization,
the fact that standard in the United 

2447
01:51:01,990 --> 01:51:03,910
States that that shit is really,
really,

2448
01:51:03,911 --> 01:51:07,000
really common and that's how we can 
afford meat so cheap,

2449
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:10,420
but even vegetables,
even vegetables,

2450
01:51:10,421 --> 01:51:12,370
it's not like growing your own shit.

2451
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:13,293
Ideally what we're supposed to do.
Those were all supposed to grow our own 

2452
01:51:16,481 --> 01:51:17,314
shit.
We're all supposed to have a piece of 

2453
01:51:18,521 --> 01:51:19,354
land and you're supposed to have 
vegetables on it and he's supposed to 

2454
01:51:21,311 --> 01:51:22,144
have a few animals that you raised,
whether it's for for milk or for cheese 

2455
01:51:25,541 --> 01:51:28,900
or for meat or for whatever.
That would be the way you could do it.

2456
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:30,850
It's just not scalable.
It's just not scalable.

2457
01:51:30,851 --> 01:51:32,020
People would starve.
Well,

2458
01:51:32,021 --> 01:51:32,854
it's not scalable in terms of the way 
we've decided to jam everybody into 

2459
01:51:35,471 --> 01:51:37,360
these cities.
It's just not well.

2460
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:38,523
Again,
I think that was just what would happen 

2461
01:51:39,911 --> 01:51:41,050
anyway.
By default,

2462
01:51:41,051 --> 01:51:44,050
people organize.
You feel safer in cities.

2463
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:47,470
You get more access to food and shelter 
of course,

2464
01:51:47,471 --> 01:51:49,530
of course,
but if you.

2465
01:51:49,630 --> 01:51:51,820
If you stop and think about the 
requirements,

2466
01:51:52,150 --> 01:51:54,610
like the food requirements of all these 
people,

2467
01:51:54,611 --> 01:51:55,270
people are.

2468
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:58,090
It's so easy for someone you and me 
included to say,

2469
01:51:58,150 --> 01:51:58,983
oh,
I don't have time to fucking gather and 

2470
01:52:00,461 --> 01:52:02,440
hunt someone,
go get my food.

2471
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:04,560
I've got to do comedy.
I got to set,

2472
01:52:04,570 --> 01:52:05,403
I got to do at the Improv.
I'm going to go to the store and buy a 

2473
01:52:07,361 --> 01:52:08,260
sandwich.
You know,

2474
01:52:08,261 --> 01:52:09,094
like you want that access and it seems 
like the only way you can get that kind 

2475
01:52:12,671 --> 01:52:15,910
of access to supermarkets and fast food 
restaurants,

2476
01:52:15,911 --> 01:52:19,360
the only way is this system that we've 
got now,

2477
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:22,410
like where you've just got massive 
amounts of animals.

2478
01:52:22,411 --> 01:52:23,244
They're getting slaughtered it.
It allows for thought and things that 

2479
01:52:27,161 --> 01:52:27,994
you see if you have to live.
If you have spent so much of your time 

2480
01:52:29,591 --> 01:52:32,640
just feeding yourself and your family or
whatever that,

2481
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:34,150
that,
that somebody was talking about.

2482
01:52:34,151 --> 01:52:34,810
Well,
where?

2483
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:35,643
Why did Greek philosophy philosophy come
out of grace where they had all that 

2484
01:52:39,071 --> 01:52:40,510
time to think?
Well,

2485
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:41,433
a lot of like certain.
I think it was the historian William 

2486
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:43,811
Mcneil said,
well,

2487
01:52:43,811 --> 01:52:46,130
they were able to export timber,
olive oil

2488
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:48,890
and wine,
and so they made money.

2489
01:52:48,891 --> 01:52:49,724
Their economy.
You could actually have some leisure 

2490
01:52:51,141 --> 01:52:51,974
time,
you could buy leisure time because they 

2491
01:52:53,991 --> 01:52:55,240
would trade,
you know,

2492
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:56,083
for all those,
for those goods that were wanted 

2493
01:52:56,991 --> 01:52:59,420
everywhere.
So what happened was you had,

2494
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:00,343
you know,
there are people that made a lot of 

2495
01:53:00,891 --> 01:53:04,580
money and they could sit around and 
think [inaudible] they could be somebody

2496
01:53:04,581 --> 01:53:05,414
was there to feed them and they didn't 
have to worry about things that the 

2497
01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:09,080
climate was temperate.
Uh,

2498
01:53:09,081 --> 01:53:10,940
so you didn't have to.
We're really worried about the winter as

2499
01:53:10,941 --> 01:53:12,140
much.
I mean it gets cold,

2500
01:53:12,141 --> 01:53:12,974
but not that goal.
That's so fascinating because that 

2501
01:53:14,181 --> 01:53:16,520
mirrors what John Anthony West said 
about Egypt.

2502
01:53:16,910 --> 01:53:17,743
He was talking about the early days of 
ancient Egypt and the Nile River being 

2503
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:24,230
such a fertile area and the food just 
blew up out of nowhere.

2504
01:53:24,231 --> 01:53:25,150
Like it would just,
it would just,

2505
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:26,950
it was easy to,
to,

2506
01:53:27,070 --> 01:53:30,350
to grow things also is also animal 
grasses that grew.

2507
01:53:30,350 --> 01:53:32,660
Anyway,
you know that there was barley and there

2508
01:53:32,661 --> 01:53:34,540
was I think millet and there was,
you know,

2509
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:35,413
that that's a huge factor that you 
didn't know you could cultivate and the 

2510
01:53:37,821 --> 01:53:42,080
natural grasses that just grew anyway,
we're also wheat.

2511
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:43,213
The,
those were there so you didn't have to 

2512
01:53:46,101 --> 01:53:46,934
kind of import them from other places.
So it's like we need these kinds of 

2513
01:53:50,211 --> 01:53:53,930
situations like these city type 
situations where we have massive amounts

2514
01:53:53,931 --> 01:53:54,764
of resources,
but we're doing it on a scale that no 

2515
01:53:57,891 --> 01:54:00,770
one else has ever done it before.
We're doing on this really bizarre scale

2516
01:54:00,771 --> 01:54:01,604
and we have to recognize that this is 
all incredibly recent in terms of like 

2517
01:54:04,490 --> 01:54:05,323
human history,
like to jam millions and millions of 

2518
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:08,533
people in cities.
I mean there had been a few cities in 

2519
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:11,570
China that had done it,
you know,

2520
01:54:11,571 --> 01:54:13,760
there's a few places around the world 
that had done it,

2521
01:54:13,761 --> 01:54:16,520
but they were essentially primitive.

2522
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:17,570
They were,
you know,

2523
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:22,570
like you're talking about what they've 
done in terms of developing a city where

2524
01:54:23,541 --> 01:54:24,374
it had a million people in the year,
1200 versus what has to be done in the 

2525
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:29,660
year 2016.
First of all,

2526
01:54:29,661 --> 01:54:32,780
you have electricity,
you have power everywhere.

2527
01:54:32,930 --> 01:54:35,120
You have sewage lines running 
everywhere.

2528
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:36,133
You've got all these people shitting and
pissing into tubes and then pumping 

2529
01:54:40,101 --> 01:54:44,170
water through this fucking pipe that 
gets rid of it somewhere.

2530
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:45,980
You got to get rid of all that shit.
Piss water.

2531
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:47,420
You've got to figure out a place to put 
it.

2532
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:49,280
You've got to have treatment plants for 
it.

2533
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:50,443
I mean you have to bring in truck boron 
over bridges and the same places where 

2534
01:54:54,981 --> 01:54:55,814
everybody else's and they're filled with
chickens and pigs and fucking and 

2535
01:54:59,090 --> 01:54:59,923
cabbage and you just got to constantly 
just keep bringing them food and bring 

2536
01:55:03,021 --> 01:55:03,854
it out there.
Shit,

2537
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:06,110
bringing in their food,
bringing out their shit.

2538
01:55:06,110 --> 01:55:06,943
You know what else that does for,
for agricultural communities that the 

2539
01:55:09,471 --> 01:55:10,304
benefit for [inaudible] when 
agricultural communities we go to war 

2540
01:55:12,711 --> 01:55:13,544
with,
like you know,

2541
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:17,120
a nomadic tribes or with with the 
exception of the Mongols,

2542
01:55:17,121 --> 01:55:20,450
but with nomadic tribes and other like 
native Americans for example,

2543
01:55:20,451 --> 01:55:21,284
is that when you come from a tradition 
of agriculture and cities like that 

2544
01:55:24,381 --> 01:55:27,920
where you have contact with animals,
nasty diseases,

2545
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:32,960
nasty diseases start to breathe and then
you build an immunity to it,

2546
01:55:32,991 --> 01:55:35,930
but guess who doesn't?
The people you come into contact with.

2547
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:37,033
So,
so many of the people like the native 

2548
01:55:37,971 --> 01:55:39,770
Americans,
they were killed by bullets,

2549
01:55:39,771 --> 01:55:43,800
but they were mainly killed by things 
like influenza and the European diseases

2550
01:55:43,801 --> 01:55:44,100
that they

2551
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,290
had zero contact with.
Well,

2552
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:47,124
that's interesting because a Dan Flores 
wrote up a paper thing was called bison 

2553
01:55:51,871 --> 01:55:54,000
diplomacy.
Bison ecology.

2554
01:55:54,001 --> 01:55:54,834
Bison,
Bison Ecology or reading his book right 

2555
01:55:56,761 --> 01:55:57,594
now about coyotes and he wrote this book
about the Buffalo and he said that the 

2556
01:56:00,811 --> 01:56:04,820
mass numbers that people had seen of the
buffalo when there was,

2557
01:56:04,821 --> 01:56:05,654
you know,
millions of them roaming across the 

2558
01:56:06,481 --> 01:56:07,314
plains.
It coincided with the native American 

2559
01:56:10,291 --> 01:56:15,180
population dwindling substantially 
because of disease by Europeans.

2560
01:56:15,450 --> 01:56:17,970
When the Europeans came over and brought
diseases,

2561
01:56:17,971 --> 01:56:21,270
it wiped out a giant percentage of the 
population and he.

2562
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:23,190
His contention was Spanish,
right?

2563
01:56:23,191 --> 01:56:25,140
Is that,
who can say yes and French too,

2564
01:56:25,141 --> 01:56:26,730
right?
I think it was mostly Spanish,

2565
01:56:26,731 --> 01:56:27,930
but yeah.
But anyway,

2566
01:56:27,931 --> 01:56:28,764
Europeans that came over and they 
brought a bunch of dirty daddy candy 

2567
01:56:31,771 --> 01:56:35,730
bags and their pigs and I'm on also 
horses of course,

2568
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:40,970
but they said he said that the native 
Americans with a firearm and with horses

2569
01:56:41,730 --> 01:56:42,563
were already on their way to extra 
padding the buffalo from a lot of its 

2570
01:56:45,901 --> 01:56:46,734
range before they got hit with these 
crazy diseases so that when you saw 

2571
01:56:51,271 --> 01:56:52,104
these millions of Buffalo,
it was a direct response to a lack of a 

2572
01:56:54,481 --> 01:56:55,090
predator.

2573
01:56:55,090 --> 01:56:57,660
Wow.
A lack of a competent Predator,

2574
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:58,553
one that they used to have in the native
Americans that would follow them around 

2575
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:03,810
with the native Americans that were 
introduced to firearms.

2576
01:57:03,811 --> 01:57:05,950
I believe he was talking about firearms 
and um,

2577
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:08,250
maybe even spears and bows and arrows as
well.

2578
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:09,203
But the horseback was the big issue 
because being on horseback you can just 

2579
01:57:11,611 --> 01:57:13,230
get right to the buffalo,
you just follow.

2580
01:57:13,231 --> 01:57:14,064
They don't,
but they didn't even know what the fuck 

2581
01:57:14,671 --> 01:57:15,750
you were,
you know,

2582
01:57:15,751 --> 01:57:16,584
they let you get right up on them like 
they never got jacked by horses before 

2583
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:20,873
they get jacked by wolves and they got 
jacked by mountain lions and they never 

2584
01:57:23,491 --> 01:57:26,990
got jacked by a horse,
a horse with a dude on it with a fucking

2585
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:32,000
spear of my side,
which is run up on them and kill him,

2586
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:33,893
kill a ton of them.
And then they would all feast and they 

2587
01:57:35,401 --> 01:57:38,430
would follow the buffalo herd around and
just keep jacking him,

2588
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:42,240
you know,
and most likely that this,

2589
01:57:42,241 --> 01:57:43,074
uh,
this Guy Dan Flores is saying that they 

2590
01:57:44,911 --> 01:57:48,390
were on their way to diminishing the 
population's greatly.

2591
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:52,770
And he points to the early European 
travelers who came through.

2592
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:55,710
They didn't talk about the Buffalo.
There's no,

2593
01:57:55,730 --> 01:57:56,563
no mention of the Buffalo.
They talked about all these other 

2594
01:57:57,931 --> 01:57:59,550
animals.
They talked about elk,

2595
01:57:59,551 --> 01:58:01,650
they talked about deer.
They talked about bear,

2596
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:02,633
who talked about antelope.
They talked about all these plains 

2597
01:58:04,291 --> 01:58:06,360
animals that they discovered and 
encountered.

2598
01:58:06,361 --> 01:58:09,660
They didn't talk about buffalo from.
From how far back?

2599
01:58:09,661 --> 01:58:12,540
Way Far back when they first started 
coming in [inaudible] 91.

2600
01:58:12,541 --> 01:58:13,021
So that.
Yeah,

2601
01:58:13,021 --> 01:58:13,854
so the early settlers accounts did not 
include these massive populations of 

2602
01:58:18,391 --> 01:58:19,224
Buffalo.
So when they had gotten to these crazy 

2603
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:23,640
numbers,
like when they started killing them for.

2604
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:24,743
There's a bunch of different reasons why
they killed them and one of the reasons 

2605
01:58:27,211 --> 01:58:31,020
why they killed him was there for 
another one was their tongues.

2606
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:34,280
They would kill gigantic herds,
just thousands of Buffalo.

2607
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:36,410
They just take their tongues and leave 
their bodies to Rye.

2608
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:38,250
They use their tongues like they ate 
them.

2609
01:58:38,490 --> 01:58:39,330
They were there.
A delicate.

2610
01:58:39,331 --> 01:58:39,850
Yeah,
there was,

2611
01:58:39,850 --> 01:58:42,220
I guess it was valuable at the time

2612
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:47,490
and they also,
they used it for the meat market so they

2613
01:58:47,501 --> 01:58:50,890
would kill them and they would take them
and they would sell them to market.

2614
01:58:50,891 --> 01:58:51,724
So there were,
there were market hunters and they were 

2615
01:58:52,851 --> 01:58:55,090
just indiscriminately white bow,
just giant numbers of them.

2616
01:58:55,091 --> 01:58:58,870
So without a doubt the the native,
the native Americans were on their way.

2617
01:58:58,871 --> 01:58:59,930
But we showed them how to do it.
Yeah,

2618
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:00,700
yeah,
yeah.

2619
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:01,533
There are always stories about sort of 
cowboys with their shoulders that were 

2620
01:59:04,121 --> 01:59:04,954
black and blue because they were 
shooting buffalo all day long and then 

2621
01:59:08,951 --> 01:59:09,784
they would take the tarps and stretch 
them out and it covered like a square 

2622
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:14,570
mile and some crazy night.
Not that,

2623
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:15,553
but like football fields of just tarps 
that were spread out and then rubbed 

2624
01:59:21,251 --> 01:59:22,190
with oil,
I guess to make,

2625
01:59:22,191 --> 01:59:23,030
you know,
so that the tarp.

2626
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:25,120
So you created a buffalo skin,
uh,

2627
01:59:25,130 --> 01:59:29,770
hide and at night you'd hear the coyotes
fighting and snarling over the,

2628
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:32,700
sort of the licking the highs and 
chewing that the shoe,

2629
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:33,573
the coyotes away.

2630
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:34,870
And then they figured out,
they said,

2631
01:59:34,871 --> 01:59:37,060
why don't we just lace the buffalo 
before we kill him?

2632
01:59:37,070 --> 01:59:39,190
Let's laced the buffalo with strict 
nights.

2633
01:59:39,191 --> 01:59:40,024
It will scan them and list the meat.
Some of the meat with strychnine and 

2634
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:46,060
those animals need the strychnine and 
they'll die.

2635
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:49,060
And then we can take those papers and 
send them back east as well.

2636
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:50,050
Well,
I never heard that.

2637
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:51,430
Yeah.
What animals were they doing?

2638
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:52,181
So,
so,

2639
01:59:52,181 --> 01:59:55,120
so all the boxes would come in,
all the coyotes,

2640
01:59:55,121 --> 01:59:58,540
all the wolves,
and then all the birds and so they would

2641
01:59:58,541 --> 02:00:02,040
take the feathers and send them to 
Europe for hats and they will take the,

2642
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:02,903
the coyote skins and they take the wolf 
skin and everything else that they're 

2643
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:07,570
releasing.
Buffalo meat was trick.

2644
02:00:07,580 --> 02:00:10,420
Now there's a great book that did that 
with wild horses.

2645
02:00:10,450 --> 02:00:11,530
Well,
they did that with Buffalo.

2646
02:00:11,531 --> 02:00:13,420
There was a great book called of wolves 
and men,

2647
02:00:13,421 --> 02:00:15,310
I believe I read a long time ago.

2648
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:18,040
And as they,
as they laid the railroad down,

2649
02:00:18,041 --> 02:00:20,050
they were shooting them from trains.
But as they,

2650
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:24,220
as they did that,
that was really what cause the planes of

2651
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:28,560
the great plains looked very much like 
the Kalahari.

2652
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:31,180
Apparently like a,
you know the African,

2653
02:00:31,181 --> 02:00:32,014
the African wilderness.
That's funny that you brought that up 

2654
02:00:34,121 --> 02:00:35,890
because that's another book the floors 
is working on.

2655
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:41,220
He's working on the American Serengeti 
Flores gets his fucking information from

2656
02:00:41,590 --> 02:00:43,690
you as a professor.
You're amazing.

2657
02:00:43,691 --> 02:00:44,890
Yeah.
I just did.

2658
02:00:44,891 --> 02:00:47,720
He taught at a major university.
I worked,

2659
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:50,590
I worked from Mugu.
He talked about.

2660
02:00:50,591 --> 02:00:52,600
That's the reason why the antelope run 
so fast,

2661
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:53,613
so at the antelope run so fast because 
they were there being chased by these 

2662
02:00:55,481 --> 02:00:57,520
big cats.
Like we used to have a cat.

2663
02:00:57,521 --> 02:00:58,354
We still have a lion that lived in North
America that's bigger than an African 

2664
02:01:00,671 --> 02:01:01,220
lion.

2665
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:02,150
Yeah.
Oh,

2666
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:05,540
that was a short tail.
I don't know what kind of tail it had.

2667
02:01:05,890 --> 02:01:10,450
We had a thing called a short face bear.
There was apparently damn most dangerous

2668
02:01:10,451 --> 02:01:11,284
bear that's ever lived.
Giant bigger than to bring that up 

2669
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:15,310
bigger than a polar bear.
Why?

2670
02:01:15,311 --> 02:01:16,144
Huge formidable Predator that they think
was one of the reasons why it took so 

2671
02:01:19,631 --> 02:01:22,390
long for people to migrate into North 
America.

2672
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:23,733
It might have been that the bering 
strait was the realm of the short face 

2673
02:01:26,651 --> 02:01:28,490
bear.
I want no part of it.

2674
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:29,830
Never seen those days.
Sure.

2675
02:01:29,831 --> 02:01:31,210
Haven't.
You need to see this.

2676
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:33,580
And uh,
whatever the American lion was,

2677
02:01:33,610 --> 02:01:36,940
there was also a thing called a terror 
bird that was this giant,

2678
02:01:36,941 --> 02:01:40,760
seven foot tall birds,
flightless bird with a giant hatchet for

2679
02:01:40,761 --> 02:01:43,070
a face that would just fuck things up.
That's,

2680
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:44,173
that is the relative size.
That's obviously a replica that's the 

2681
02:01:47,481 --> 02:01:48,920
size of a short face bear.

2682
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:51,110
Apparently.
It was just an enormous,

2683
02:01:51,111 --> 02:01:53,830
enormous bear and look at that other 
fucking thing is that.

2684
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:57,410
That's a dangerous day at Don Dawn.
Dawn,

2685
02:01:57,890 --> 02:01:59,960
some other horrible looking monster with
teeth.

2686
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:02,550
It looks like a deer with wolf teeth.
Well,

2687
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:04,160
it looks like a hedgehog.
Yeah,

2688
02:02:04,161 --> 02:02:05,300
well,
like a buffalo,

2689
02:02:05,301 --> 02:02:06,710
which I.
Andy fucking pig.

2690
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:09,260
Yeah.
God Damn Man.

2691
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:12,020
There were some crazy fucking animals I 
want.

2692
02:02:12,021 --> 02:02:12,854
No.
Part of that was really interesting is 

2693
02:02:14,481 --> 02:02:19,370
that the massive them went extinct 
somewhere around the end of the ice age.

2694
02:02:19,371 --> 02:02:20,204
They just all got.
We'll probably for the same reason why 

2695
02:02:21,921 --> 02:02:24,470
the ice age and probably a lot of shit 
going on.

2696
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:26,450
A lot of factors.
That's how big it is.

2697
02:02:26,990 --> 02:02:29,060
Oh my God.
That's impressive.

2698
02:02:29,290 --> 02:02:32,150
Look at the size of that fucking thing.
That's just a Kodiak bear.

2699
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:36,770
I could easily be a Kodiak that easily 
kept their 11 feet high or some shit.

2700
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:38,030
Yeah.
The big ones are.

2701
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:39,620
Are you kidding me?
Yeah.

2702
02:02:39,621 --> 02:02:41,960
There's a great video.
You want to shit your pants.

2703
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:47,060
It a great video from a guard booth in 
Alaska where these guys are inside,

2704
02:02:47,061 --> 02:02:47,894
like one of those part ranger guard 
booths and they're watching this bear 

2705
02:02:51,230 --> 02:02:52,063
walkthrough.
That's the size of a bus complete is a 

2706
02:02:54,381 --> 02:02:55,214
fucking tank.
It looks like a few like a VW bus and 

2707
02:02:58,221 --> 02:02:59,240
and they're,
they're in there and go,

2708
02:02:59,241 --> 02:03:00,110
oh my God,
look at him,

2709
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:00,771
look at him,
look at him,

2710
02:03:00,771 --> 02:03:01,604
look at him,
and the thing just strolls right past 

2711
02:03:03,471 --> 02:03:07,370
the guard booth and you get a sense 
because they're inside this building,

2712
02:03:07,371 --> 02:03:09,710
but the building is only 10 feet from 
this animal.

2713
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:10,633
So you get like a really clear sense of 
proportion of how big it is and you're 

2714
02:03:13,731 --> 02:03:15,140
like,
oh my God,

2715
02:03:15,141 --> 02:03:15,974
fucking crazy.
It's like 11 feet long and it probably 

2716
02:03:18,261 --> 02:03:18,920
weighs,
you know,

2717
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,330
who knows how much,
how many,

2718
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:20,990
how much do I have?

2719
02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:22,370
Fifteen hundred pounds.
You never,

2720
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:25,760
you feel such a good way to feel like 
food and shoes.

2721
02:03:25,761 --> 02:03:29,720
You're so demeaning of you.
That's why going to zoos makes me always

2722
02:03:29,721 --> 02:03:34,430
feel a little shitty about myself.
I'm the weakest link in the chain.

2723
02:03:34,431 --> 02:03:38,630
I'm just a ball pink piece of fucking 
food.

2724
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:39,883
I suck compared to your guns and cars 
and shit that's brain and figured it 

2725
02:03:43,611 --> 02:03:45,380
out,
but when you see this thing,

2726
02:03:45,670 --> 02:03:48,890
got it.
No bear giant bear walks.

2727
02:03:48,891 --> 02:03:51,860
Past Guard booth in Alaska.
I'll find it.

2728
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:52,723
You want.
If you want to be a big cat before 

2729
02:03:55,371 --> 02:03:58,160
you're eaten by a bear because bears 
just start eating you and you're alive.

2730
02:03:58,161 --> 02:04:01,040
Big Cat to get the back of your neck and
quite.

2731
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:02,120
Yeah,
they get your face.

2732
02:04:02,121 --> 02:04:02,954
They don't want to fight.
Now they want you to die so they could 

2733
02:04:04,471 --> 02:04:05,350
eat you.
Yuck.

2734
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:06,343
Bears are so vulnerable.
They don't feel the need to kill you 

2735
02:04:08,181 --> 02:04:08,900
first.

2736
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:10,790
It's not necessary.
They just hold you down.

2737
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:11,810
Here it is.
Watch this.

2738
02:04:11,990 --> 02:04:15,200
So these guys around the guard booth and
this thing starts.

2739
02:04:15,201 --> 02:04:16,330
Lumbering.
Tourism.

2740
02:04:17,170 --> 02:04:19,760
Grizzly.
It's so big.

2741
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:20,960
It's so.
What's the name of it?

2742
02:04:20,961 --> 02:04:24,840
Jamie says,
must see huge brown bear walking pass.

2743
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:26,480
Brooks Lodge.
Ranger station.

2744
02:04:26,510 --> 02:04:29,290
So as these guys are sitting there in 
their truck like,

2745
02:04:29,291 --> 02:04:33,060
look how close it is,
what it was on the road doing these.

2746
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:35,720
These guys are stand there.
Watch out walks right by there.

2747
02:04:35,721 --> 02:04:40,590
I mean that things tend to fade away.
Oh my gosh.

2748
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:41,723
Oh my gosh.
They don't even swear and they're so 

2749
02:04:42,961 --> 02:04:44,890
nice up there.
I look at that.

2750
02:04:45,940 --> 02:04:46,800
No,
watch this.

2751
02:04:46,801 --> 02:04:50,250
Look at the lady walking down the road.
See down there.

2752
02:04:50,430 --> 02:04:54,150
What is that?
A dude might be a dude.

2753
02:04:54,240 --> 02:04:55,073
So let's say lady might be a lady,
but either way it just decides not to 

2754
02:04:58,591 --> 02:05:00,990
walk over and eat her.
Like she's just out there.

2755
02:05:01,350 --> 02:05:04,230
If it went into a dead sprint,
that'd be around.

2756
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:05,370
It's catching her.
Oh,

2757
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:06,233
for sure.
You never getting away from that thing 

2758
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:09,810
and that she didn't even see that bear?
No.

2759
02:05:10,310 --> 02:05:11,143
She would have heard it coming.
She would have heard of breathing 

2760
02:05:12,361 --> 02:05:13,194
properly.

2761
02:05:14,890 --> 02:05:15,723
Yeah.
I wonder what it would've done if we'd 

2762
02:05:16,531 --> 02:05:19,140
have checked to see if she had a gun.
Oh no,

2763
02:05:19,141 --> 02:05:19,974
I wouldn't eat in her.
I mean what it like just run up to her 

2764
02:05:21,901 --> 02:05:22,734
and eating her.
Because the thing they say about 

2765
02:05:23,851 --> 02:05:24,684
grizzlies is it's way less likely that a
grizzly bear is going to kill you for 

2766
02:05:28,231 --> 02:05:29,064
food and wine.
More likely they're going to kill you 

2767
02:05:30,751 --> 02:05:31,584
because you stumble upon a mother with 
her cubs and she's protecting her 

2768
02:05:33,970 --> 02:05:36,690
because grizzly bears don't necessarily 
look at people's food,

2769
02:05:36,720 --> 02:05:37,553
but black bear apparently are more 
opportunistic predators and there's way 

2770
02:05:40,951 --> 02:05:45,210
more way more incidents of black bears 
attacking and killing people for food.

2771
02:05:45,810 --> 02:05:49,470
Then there is a of grizzly bears.
Grizzly bears definitely have done it,

2772
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:53,640
but it appears that a black bears do it 
more for food more for predation.

2773
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:56,100
Brunello was telling us about a story 
about,

2774
02:05:56,101 --> 02:05:58,350
oh shit.
Running up to a dog.

2775
02:05:59,550 --> 02:06:02,490
It scared that a dog is a that's from 
American Werewolf in London.

2776
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:05,940
Video ended right as a set of people 
that were filming it.

2777
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:06,900
Oh really?
Yeah,

2778
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:09,570
because they were fucking with says mom 
Barrett tax.

2779
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:10,830
Oh wait,
okay.

2780
02:06:10,831 --> 02:06:11,730
I don't need to say that.

2781
02:06:14,790 --> 02:06:16,380
It is A.
Anyway,

2782
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:18,720
bears scary.
Not Good.

2783
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:19,643
Don't get eaten.
But it was telling a story about a 

2784
02:06:21,511 --> 02:06:22,630
friend of his,
a.

2785
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:24,300
I'm going to fuck the story up,
I'm sure.

2786
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:25,200
But,
uh,

2787
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:26,033
I think that just the story was they 
took this guy out for the first time 

2788
02:06:28,441 --> 02:06:31,830
hunting ever.
He got attacked by a 500 pound predatory

2789
02:06:31,831 --> 02:06:34,820
black bear in his tent while he's 
sleeping.

2790
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:36,450
Bear comes in the tent,
mauls him.

2791
02:06:36,690 --> 02:06:38,610
Somebody wakes up,
shoots the bear,

2792
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:41,670
hits him in the wrist,
breaks his wrist,

2793
02:06:41,730 --> 02:06:42,563
and then the bear gets out of that tank,
runs in another tent and they shoot it 

2794
02:06:46,050 --> 02:06:49,170
500 pound predatory black bear.
So that's a bear.

2795
02:06:49,171 --> 02:06:53,400
That's how much you weigh.
One 71 72,

2796
02:06:53,401 --> 02:06:54,234
shred it.
So I'm somewhere in the range of 200 

2797
02:06:56,551 --> 02:07:00,660
pounds.
So you and I and then a lot more.

2798
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:01,553
Another 100 plus pounds,
another 125 pounds and it's a fucking 

2799
02:07:04,081 --> 02:07:06,740
bear and you're by yourself and you're 
sleeping.

2800
02:07:06,750 --> 02:07:10,290
It's your first time ever hunting and 
this thing comes through the door.

2801
02:07:10,530 --> 02:07:15,530
Just all hot fucking funk breath.
Never taken a bath in it's life.

2802
02:07:16,430 --> 02:07:20,690
Just looking to rip you apart while you 
fast twitch muscle and dense bone.

2803
02:07:20,730 --> 02:07:23,550
Your friend shoots you in the wrist,
your friend shoots at it,

2804
02:07:23,551 --> 02:07:24,384
and I don't know if it got a pass 
through and the the the bear's body and 

2805
02:07:27,271 --> 02:07:29,520
then hit him because that sometimes 
happens,

2806
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:31,380
but either way you get shot in the 
wrist.

2807
02:07:31,850 --> 02:07:32,683
Bear mauls.
You were talking about how the new it 

2808
02:07:34,290 --> 02:07:36,670
used to kill seals and they would use

2809
02:07:36,790 --> 02:07:39,460
polar bear bone.
Now,

2810
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:42,670
how do you kill a polar bear?
Do you know how,

2811
02:07:43,050 --> 02:07:44,990
but I know how to killed wolves.
You know,

2812
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:45,833
they used to kill wolves,
whether used to take a blade and put 

2813
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:50,010
blood on it and it was just keep looking
and bleed today,

2814
02:07:50,530 --> 02:07:53,890
but I believe with polar bears,
they would kill them missile.

2815
02:07:53,891 --> 02:07:57,190
When they were sleeping,
it was find out where they were sleeping

2816
02:07:57,640 --> 02:07:58,473
and they would come in there and stabbed
the shit out of them while they were 

2817
02:08:01,121 --> 02:08:03,320
sleeping and then they would take that 
box.

2818
02:08:03,330 --> 02:08:04,163
It was extra hard and they would put at 
the end of their spirit and that's how 

2819
02:08:06,281 --> 02:08:10,060
they would kill seals.
Did you ever wonder how inuits who lived

2820
02:08:10,061 --> 02:08:13,840
in that ice region got water?
Because remember what the water is,

2821
02:08:13,841 --> 02:08:15,050
it's all saltwater,
right?

2822
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:18,280
Ice Is all salt water.
So how do you get water?

2823
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:20,860
How the fuck you get water is polar 
bears Dick.

2824
02:08:21,130 --> 02:08:22,150
Very good.
And,

2825
02:08:22,180 --> 02:08:23,230
and I,
and yes,

2826
02:08:23,231 --> 02:08:25,780
most of the time you're not very 
scientific.

2827
02:08:26,170 --> 02:08:27,550
Oh,
do I am okay.

2828
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:28,443
But you have to.
Apparently they would be able to see 

2829
02:08:30,371 --> 02:08:34,240
what the old guys,
the old old ice by the color of it,

2830
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:36,310
the older the ice,
the,

2831
02:08:36,311 --> 02:08:38,560
I guess the,
the less salt.

2832
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:39,633
So you would find really old ice.
And that was the ice that you would 

2833
02:08:41,771 --> 02:08:43,840
meltdown as water.
Where's the fuck?

2834
02:08:43,870 --> 02:08:44,710
Yeah.
So the,

2835
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:49,160
the Arctic explorers who didn't hook up 
with the inuit always died.

2836
02:08:50,220 --> 02:08:52,200
They just froze to death.
They didn't,

2837
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:54,100
they couldn't find food.
It sucked.

2838
02:08:54,370 --> 02:08:57,380
And the ones that immediately made 
friends with the nun,

2839
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:58,700
uh,
they,

2840
02:08:58,700 --> 02:08:59,533
they came back nice and fat.
They had plenty of seal meat and they 

2841
02:09:03,131 --> 02:09:03,964
would always have to get rid of all 
their clothing and where exactly what 

2842
02:09:06,521 --> 02:09:07,354
the intuit would wear,
what kind of a fucking crazy person 

2843
02:09:10,270 --> 02:09:11,860
decides to go to the Antarctic.

2844
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:13,233
Uh,
the British who wanted to find a 

2845
02:09:14,470 --> 02:09:15,303
different way routes from trade,
but just think about what kind of a 

2846
02:09:17,561 --> 02:09:19,470
crazy person and you feel like that's 
what I want to do this.

2847
02:09:19,510 --> 02:09:21,460
I want to go home and be the first guy 
to go to Antarctica.

2848
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:25,000
Bad asses.
I'm just gonna walk across that frozen.

2849
02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:28,250
It looks like nothing that had the 
Messiness,

2850
02:09:28,330 --> 02:09:30,050
that story about,
I can't remember the name,

2851
02:09:30,090 --> 02:09:33,050
wasn't shackleton was another guy who 
was an explorer and he,

2852
02:09:33,051 --> 02:09:33,884
he,
his men were all starving and dying and 

2853
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:37,750
he knew he was going to die,
but he was a British Aristocrat,

2854
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:38,181
you know.
And,

2855
02:09:38,181 --> 02:09:40,120
and when you were in Britain,
you had a duty,

2856
02:09:40,450 --> 02:09:41,283
you've got a duty to,
to essentially use your free time to 

2857
02:09:44,051 --> 02:09:45,790
make the world a better place.
And so,

2858
02:09:45,791 --> 02:09:49,000
uh,
he famously stiff upper lip,

2859
02:09:49,270 --> 02:09:51,160
uh,
grew up on a life of discipline,

2860
02:09:51,190 --> 02:09:52,023
never showing every your emotions 
properly carted away to boarding school 

2861
02:09:54,941 --> 02:09:56,890
at six years old as they always were.

2862
02:09:57,580 --> 02:09:59,520
Definitely did some buggery,
uh,

2863
02:09:59,550 --> 02:10:00,460
as to do that.
Right.

2864
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:01,840
That was real common.
Still is,

2865
02:10:02,170 --> 02:10:03,003
uh,
the opera class to send their kids to 

2866
02:10:04,211 --> 02:10:06,220
school at seven,
the older classmates and like,

2867
02:10:06,221 --> 02:10:08,170
hey jay stuff,
there's a lot of problems.

2868
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:09,280
Uh,
but uh,

2869
02:10:09,281 --> 02:10:11,220
he said famously,
um,

2870
02:10:12,130 --> 02:10:13,960
as he knew he was going to die his,
his foot,

2871
02:10:13,961 --> 02:10:16,690
apparently it was gangrene and he looked
at his men and he said,

2872
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:21,700
I'm going for a walk and they may be 
some time and he just,

2873
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:24,910
wow.
He just rather than convenience and with

2874
02:10:24,911 --> 02:10:25,744
his death,
because that would be very unblemish he 

2875
02:10:27,551 --> 02:10:32,410
walked off and frozen stuff.
That's a bad ass because,

2876
02:10:32,650 --> 02:10:33,483
because keeping up and if you read some 
of the letters as they were dying and 

2877
02:10:35,871 --> 02:10:36,704
starving to death,
their letters are incredibly formal and 

2878
02:10:39,111 --> 02:10:39,944
still poised and always taking into 
account that they had to keep up 

2879
02:10:43,941 --> 02:10:44,774
appearances and that they had to uh,
always remind themselves that they were 

2880
02:10:48,081 --> 02:10:48,914
there for a bigger cause and that their 
personal discomfort was just not 

2881
02:10:51,981 --> 02:10:53,650
something you inconvenience anybody 
with.

2882
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:54,583
That was the highest level of 
civilization they will capable of 

2883
02:10:57,591 --> 02:10:58,424
expressing before emojis.
See now you could send someone a text 

2884
02:11:02,541 --> 02:11:03,374
message and say,
I don't think the dis dis shit is going 

2885
02:11:07,171 --> 02:11:07,860
to work out.

2886
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:08,693
Yeah,
the piece out if you want to sell fam 

2887
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:11,873
and then you'd have like an Emoji with a
peace sign and then like you and then a 

2888
02:11:14,851 --> 02:11:18,270
gun dude,
if you want to see the antithesis to the

2889
02:11:18,271 --> 02:11:20,670
Emoji and the American culture as it is 
now.

2890
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:24,810
Good.
Youtube a debate between James Baldwin,

2891
02:11:24,811 --> 02:11:25,644
the Great African American author and 
William F Buckley at Cambridge 

2892
02:11:29,610 --> 02:11:30,443
University in 1965.
Everybody who's listening please do 

2893
02:11:33,361 --> 02:11:34,194
that.
Just set up to do with emojis just 

2894
02:11:35,821 --> 02:11:36,654
because that was debate and language and
formality and hieroglyphs and cadres 

2895
02:11:41,590 --> 02:11:42,151
goes.
They're all,

2896
02:11:42,151 --> 02:11:43,530
they're talking about.
Uh,

2897
02:11:43,531 --> 02:11:43,950
the,
the,

2898
02:11:43,950 --> 02:11:44,783
the question was,
is it was the American dream at the 

2899
02:11:47,941 --> 02:11:50,700
expense of the American Negro or does it
not?

2900
02:11:50,701 --> 02:11:52,770
And that is the debate.
And Ms Dot Buckley was close.

2901
02:11:52,830 --> 02:11:55,740
Choose that.
It is not an Mr Ronald Reagan's visit.

2902
02:11:55,741 --> 02:11:56,574
It is.
And James Bond gets him a rousing 

2903
02:11:58,051 --> 02:11:59,310
speech.
Nineteen 65.

2904
02:11:59,640 --> 02:12:04,640
I brought the cotton to market and I 
picked the cotton for nothing,

2905
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:06,233
for nothing.
But I would always be an inevitable and 

2906
02:12:09,571 --> 02:12:11,030
then William Buckley,
he gets up and.

2907
02:12:11,130 --> 02:12:11,963
But the formality,
the theatricality and the fucking 

2908
02:12:14,971 --> 02:12:15,804
language,
the way English was spoken by the upper 

2909
02:12:17,701 --> 02:12:19,830
classes are the educated back in the 
day.

2910
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:21,480
This is so great.
He's 12 years old.

2911
02:12:21,540 --> 02:12:21,901
No,
no.

2912
02:12:21,901 --> 02:12:26,901
That's not the beginning of that bait 
flowing dresses for university.

2913
02:12:27,101 --> 02:12:27,820
He's.
Yeah.

2914
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:30,600
And fast forward to James Baldwin 
talking.

2915
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:32,330
It's actually quite amazing.

2916
02:12:32,630 --> 02:12:36,020
We can't really play it anyway.
We'll get yanked off of youtube.

2917
02:12:36,630 --> 02:12:38,930
That's somebody else's content that 
somebody else owns us.

2918
02:12:38,990 --> 02:12:40,760
It's really important to watch though,
I think.

2919
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:44,300
Well,
that was my though was that.

2920
02:12:44,450 --> 02:12:45,283
Do you think that the reason why that 
formality was so appreciated and 

2921
02:12:48,381 --> 02:12:49,214
accepted and it was so highly regarded,
was because that was the highest level 

2922
02:12:53,031 --> 02:12:55,640
of civilization that they had before 
technology,

2923
02:12:55,940 --> 02:12:56,773
before technology and before being.
There was a limited amount that you can 

2924
02:12:59,091 --> 02:13:02,480
influence the environment back then and 
you could have more influence yourself.

2925
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:04,350
You could more educate yourself.
You could,

2926
02:13:04,790 --> 02:13:06,500
if you wanted to go somewhere,
you got to get on a boat.

2927
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:07,653
Okay.
You got to get on a boat with everybody 

2928
02:13:08,331 --> 02:13:09,680
else.
He had to get on a train.

2929
02:13:09,681 --> 02:13:11,540
If you want to get across the country,
you had to get on the train.

2930
02:13:11,810 --> 02:13:12,643
If you want to write something,
you had to use a quill and you had to 

2931
02:13:14,661 --> 02:13:15,494
have a little thing of ink and yet a dip
it in there and that's how he wrote 

2932
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:22,100
period and it was a limited amount that 
you could do.

2933
02:13:22,340 --> 02:13:23,173
Like you know,
you couldn't just go home and sit and 

2934
02:13:24,051 --> 02:13:26,530
watch television.
You couldn't a code,

2935
02:13:26,531 --> 02:13:29,870
a video game.
He says less distraction.

2936
02:13:29,930 --> 02:13:30,763
There's less distraction and the the,
the level of ability that you could 

2937
02:13:35,570 --> 02:13:38,820
where you could express civilization at 
its highest level.

2938
02:13:38,821 --> 02:13:42,570
It was basically like code a few 
machines that people had built,

2939
02:13:42,870 --> 02:13:45,240
a few combustion machines,
the trains,

2940
02:13:45,241 --> 02:13:46,074
things along those lines and then the 
rest of it was just like houses and 

2941
02:13:49,531 --> 02:13:50,364
rule.

2942
02:13:50,830 --> 02:13:53,170
I don't know if that's.
I don't know if that's accurate.

2943
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:54,153
I think it might also be that I like.
I think that's part of it and I think 

2944
02:13:57,491 --> 02:14:00,880
that's a valid kind of a description of 
maybe part of what was going on,

2945
02:14:00,881 --> 02:14:02,440
but I think something else is going on 
with those,

2946
02:14:02,470 --> 02:14:03,303
with those debates.
I think that when you the reason like 

2947
02:14:05,651 --> 02:14:08,410
something like firing line watch,
firing line with William F Buckley,

2948
02:14:08,411 --> 02:14:10,180
popular show,
it's molasses.

2949
02:14:10,181 --> 02:14:11,050
You,
you've got to read.

2950
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:15,010
You're listening to men speak about long
ideas.

2951
02:14:15,570 --> 02:14:16,403
Actually.
One of the things I really appreciate 

2952
02:14:16,721 --> 02:14:17,554
about your show because you're having 
such smart people on having real 

2953
02:14:18,821 --> 02:14:19,654
discussions,
but then how the fuck did you get on 

2954
02:14:20,651 --> 02:14:24,720
here?
I have no idea what barn,

2955
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:29,780
but I think he got me.
He fucking got me again,

2956
02:14:30,790 --> 02:14:35,380
but.
But back then like there was.

2957
02:14:35,410 --> 02:14:36,243
It feels like political commitment and 
winning these arguments between right 

2958
02:14:40,241 --> 02:14:44,270
and left as they were known had actual 
ramifications because the.

2959
02:14:44,530 --> 02:14:45,363
It feels like politics and whatever 
happens in an election today means less 

2960
02:14:50,111 --> 02:14:50,944
to people and has less of an effect.
At least an immediate effect because 

2961
02:14:55,601 --> 02:14:57,970
back in those days,
65,

2962
02:14:58,300 --> 02:14:59,133
the wars that were going on with 
ideology and wars with fascism and 

2963
02:15:02,441 --> 02:15:03,274
communism and capitalism.
People were actually dying and having 

2964
02:15:07,061 --> 02:15:07,894
real wars.
They were national awards that were set 

2965
02:15:11,141 --> 02:15:15,100
to defend not only resources but those 
ideologies and entire movement,

2966
02:15:15,250 --> 02:15:18,850
and I think that there was the sense 
that if this side wins,

2967
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:22,450
then that side of it is going to come 
over and take us over.

2968
02:15:22,451 --> 02:15:23,284
There was this real ideology between 
this and so I think that those debates 

2969
02:15:27,130 --> 02:15:27,963
people took very personally because they
probably knew somebody who died 

2970
02:15:31,211 --> 02:15:32,044
defending the world against fascism.
They were afraid of the red scare or 

2971
02:15:36,551 --> 02:15:37,384
they were committed communists and they 
were being persecuted for it because 

2972
02:15:39,941 --> 02:15:42,250
they couldn't get a job in Hollywood.
There's a real,

2973
02:15:42,410 --> 02:15:43,243
a culture war that had actual tangible 
ramifications that you could see every 

2974
02:15:47,530 --> 02:15:48,363
day.
My God,

2975
02:15:48,370 --> 02:15:49,203
the Vietnam War,
Americans were dying every day because 

2976
02:15:51,401 --> 02:15:52,234
there were.
There were sent out there to make the 

2977
02:15:52,841 --> 02:15:54,590
world safe for democracy.
Right.

2978
02:15:54,670 --> 02:15:57,370
That was a factor too.
I think that was not a factor.

2979
02:15:57,371 --> 02:15:59,440
I think there certainly was a lot going 
on there with that,

2980
02:15:59,441 --> 02:16:01,810
but we were really talking about people 
even before that era.

2981
02:16:02,180 --> 02:16:03,013
I think when we were talking about the 
guy from Antarctica that I'm going out 

2982
02:16:07,331 --> 02:16:09,420
for a walk maybe some times.
Yeah,

2983
02:16:10,180 --> 02:16:15,180
I think there was something with the 
intellectuals of the day where they were

2984
02:16:15,430 --> 02:16:16,263
way more uncorrupted by,
by the world that we live in today in 

2985
02:16:21,131 --> 02:16:21,964
terms of.
You mean like they had a sense of duty 

2986
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:26,200
and I think there was,
it was a very,

2987
02:16:26,590 --> 02:16:27,423
very important position,
right to be the who disseminated the 

2988
02:16:30,281 --> 02:16:34,690
information in 17,
95 made decisions and made decisions and

2989
02:16:34,691 --> 02:16:38,200
was in charge of like libraries and 
books and it was teaching universities.

2990
02:16:38,201 --> 02:16:39,034
I mean you've got to think of like what 
different British universities were 

2991
02:16:41,111 --> 02:16:43,000
around the 17 hundreds,
like quite a few,

2992
02:16:43,001 --> 02:16:43,834
right?

2993
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:44,733
I bet you could name like,
like isn't Yale for the seventh when 

2994
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:53,160
yell was founded in late,
late 17 or I think Harvard as well,

2995
02:16:53,891 --> 02:16:57,650
or at least I think didn't Thomas 
Jefferson wrote about a Cambridge,

2996
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:58,833
Cambridge Oxford didn't.
I think Isaac Newton went to Oxford 

2997
02:17:03,090 --> 02:17:04,040
gala.
17,

2998
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:05,710
17,
11.

2999
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:06,970
Incredible.
Incredible.

3000
02:17:06,971 --> 02:17:07,804
Wow.
So like back then raising and that was 

3001
02:17:10,481 --> 02:17:12,460
the.
So you think of let's just go to 17.

3002
02:17:12,461 --> 02:17:13,600
Oh,
one in 17,

3003
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:14,493
11,
the intellectuals with the highest 

3004
02:17:15,701 --> 02:17:16,534
expression of civilization because there
really wasn't that much technological 

3005
02:17:20,261 --> 02:17:21,094
expression.
There really wasn't that much that had 

3006
02:17:22,241 --> 02:17:24,070
been done.
There's where there was guns,

3007
02:17:24,071 --> 02:17:24,904
there was some machines.
I don't even know they even have a 

3008
02:17:26,411 --> 02:17:28,510
printing press.
I don't believe they did in 17.

3009
02:17:28,511 --> 02:17:29,110
Oh,
one.

3010
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:31,990
When was the dependent printing presses,
but with added,

3011
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:33,733
was it?
Yes.

3012
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:34,301
Oh,
that's right.

3013
02:17:34,301 --> 02:17:35,920
That's when Martin Luther was.
Um,

3014
02:17:36,030 --> 02:17:37,540
yeah,
they had a printing press back then.

3015
02:17:37,590 --> 02:17:38,150
Yeah.
Um,

3016
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:39,580
um,
what's his name?

3017
02:17:40,850 --> 02:17:42,670
What's,
who invented the printing press?

3018
02:17:42,671 --> 02:17:45,010
I can't believe I'm forgetting this or 
certainly didn't have typewriters.

3019
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:47,740
So they,
they'd have to type face things.

3020
02:17:47,770 --> 02:17:50,530
So they would probably read off 
manuscripts in schools.

3021
02:17:50,620 --> 02:17:53,050
So like when,
when they were in schools and they would

3022
02:17:53,051 --> 02:17:55,060
write,
I think they interpreted.

3023
02:17:55,470 --> 02:17:57,370
Did they have typewriters printing,
press.

3024
02:17:57,371 --> 02:17:59,800
Gutenberg.
What year was the typewriter?

3025
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:05,170
Probably back then.
Here's what's crazy about it all.

3026
02:18:05,290 --> 02:18:06,123
This is something that I've been talking
about on stage is a how recent all that 

3027
02:18:09,611 --> 02:18:10,660
was.
It seems,

3028
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:15,760
it seems so far away for us,
but this is the way I describe it,

3029
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:18,700
like people live to be 100,
that's 300 years ago.

3030
02:18:18,701 --> 02:18:23,410
It's three people crazy.
It's three people go whoa.

3031
02:18:23,740 --> 02:18:24,573
Thirteen years there with 17,
so they had 13 years of no typewriters 

3032
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:28,443
and then written by scrawls things with 
sell written by Inc and I'm sure you 

3033
02:18:32,291 --> 02:18:33,124
know,
it took a long time for that diffusion 

3034
02:18:33,731 --> 02:18:37,600
of that innovation when you think the 
typewriter really like totally kicked in

3035
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:40,660
for 18 hundreds.
I bet that 19th century,

3036
02:18:41,110 --> 02:18:44,650
or maybe it was the 18th and the 19th 
century before it was mass produced with

3037
02:18:44,651 --> 02:18:45,484
the industrial age when you could make a
lot of them for cheap enough to buy 

3038
02:18:48,610 --> 02:18:49,443
would imagine.

3039
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:51,990
Isn't it crazy to that?
We still use the cordy.

3040
02:18:52,320 --> 02:18:55,810
Uh,
the way the keyboards are assembled,

3041
02:18:55,990 --> 02:18:58,450
it works is to use the court.
He configuration it does work,

3042
02:18:58,451 --> 02:19:00,790
but it's not the fastest way to do it.
And some people are dorks.

3043
02:19:00,791 --> 02:19:01,624
No,
some people are dorks and they learned 

3044
02:19:02,711 --> 02:19:04,300
the other way.
What's the other way?

3045
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:05,493
Dove racks or something like that.
So you find the most efficient typing 

3046
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:10,263
configuration,
there's a second type of configuration 

3047
02:19:12,670 --> 02:19:15,040
that's more efficient and not a friend 
of mine tried it,

3048
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:16,233
he tried to learn it and he said it was,
but it took them too long and he would 

3049
02:19:19,361 --> 02:19:20,194
have to like reprogram computers when he
got them and enough to buy this certain 

3050
02:19:23,441 --> 02:19:25,720
keyboard.
And if you had a laptop you were fucked.

3051
02:19:26,530 --> 02:19:27,780
This is the.
Yeah,

3052
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:28,180
D

3053
02:19:28,180 --> 02:19:31,030
Devora,
black man or coal Mac.

3054
02:19:31,590 --> 02:19:33,530
Okay.
So there's two different ones.

3055
02:19:33,531 --> 02:19:34,364
Qwerty is what we have.
But a scroll up again so I could read 

3056
02:19:37,971 --> 02:19:38,804
that.
So alternative keyboard layouts 

3057
02:19:40,101 --> 02:19:43,330
explained should you switch to devor,
ach or coal muck.

3058
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:44,990
So Cole,
c o,

3059
02:19:44,991 --> 02:19:49,991
l e m a k or D v O r a k.
So there's two different configurations,

3060
02:19:50,211 --> 02:19:51,044
like we see that configuration,
like it doesn't have quarterly at the 

3061
02:19:52,851 --> 02:19:53,684
top.
The very top is like those Arrow keys 

3062
02:19:55,641 --> 02:19:58,490
and the dot and the comma.
And then it starts with a p.

3063
02:19:58,491 --> 02:20:00,380
that's the first letter on the first,
uh,

3064
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:02,810
the first column.
And then the other letter,

3065
02:20:02,811 --> 02:20:03,644
it's a as in the same place,
but as isn't in the same place right 

3066
02:20:05,931 --> 02:20:08,920
next to a is.
Oh and S is way the fuck over there with

3067
02:20:08,921 --> 02:20:11,330
your other pinkie is.
It's really confusing.

3068
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:14,870
But apparently if you really learn how 
to type,

3069
02:20:15,290 --> 02:20:17,490
that's the best configuration because 
your,

3070
02:20:17,491 --> 02:20:19,520
your hands can flow more smoothly.

3071
02:20:19,810 --> 02:20:22,250
And I think the scroll back up there 
please.

3072
02:20:22,251 --> 02:20:25,610
So we can see that.
I think that configuration was,

3073
02:20:26,030 --> 02:20:26,863
if I remember correctly,
they invented that because the old 

3074
02:20:28,881 --> 02:20:32,660
typewriters used to bind if you smash 
keys next to each other too quickly.

3075
02:20:32,990 --> 02:20:35,360
So they decided to spread it out a 
little bit.

3076
02:20:35,420 --> 02:20:37,310
I'm old enough to remember that.
That's pathetic.

3077
02:20:37,370 --> 02:20:38,060
I was.
Fuck,

3078
02:20:38,060 --> 02:20:39,150
I'm not kidding.
I remember that.

3079
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:42,140
That happened in my with my mother's 
when I was trying to type.

3080
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:46,950
I'll be at Calgary this weekend,
just weekend.

3081
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:49,910
I'll be there this weekend.
Thursday,

3082
02:20:49,911 --> 02:20:50,571
Friday,
Saturday.

3083
02:20:50,571 --> 02:20:51,620
Yuck.
Calgary.

3084
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:53,060
Come see me.
I love Calgary.

3085
02:20:53,090 --> 02:20:56,720
I'm bringing heat to have big factory 
farming up there.

3086
02:20:56,721 --> 02:20:58,370
They don't.
Not sure they do,

3087
02:20:58,371 --> 02:21:00,110
but I love color.
I love Calgary.

3088
02:21:00,140 --> 02:21:04,160
Trying to pay the people of Canada.
Don't you love Canadians to do.

3089
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:05,390
We were talking about that.
Yeah.

3090
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:06,560
The nicest people in the world.

3091
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:08,810
Yeah,
so I always like to go to Calgary.

3092
02:21:08,910 --> 02:21:13,190
I'm going to.
I'm doing Massey Hall on December ninth.

3093
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:14,353
Tickets went on presale today.
It's with Russell Peters and big Jay 

3094
02:21:18,410 --> 02:21:19,220
Oakerson.
Really?

3095
02:21:19,220 --> 02:21:22,150
The two of you guys and a big chase?
Yeah.

3096
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:24,410
Wow.
And that's December,

3097
02:21:24,411 --> 02:21:26,600
ninth night before the UFC.
That's impressive.

3098
02:21:27,140 --> 02:21:28,310
Yeah.
That's going to be the time.

3099
02:21:28,460 --> 02:21:29,091
Yeah.
What about you?

3100
02:21:29,091 --> 02:21:31,580
What are you doing that night?
I'll be in.

3101
02:21:31,581 --> 02:21:32,391
Well,
I know.

3102
02:21:32,391 --> 02:21:35,930
I don't know that night to say,
what are you doing in December ninth and

3103
02:21:35,931 --> 02:21:37,970
10th?
I'm going to be.

3104
02:21:38,030 --> 02:21:41,390
I know where I'm going to be in at the 
Fort Lauderdale Improv.

3105
02:21:41,820 --> 02:21:43,700
I was going to ask you to come with us.
I would love to,

3106
02:21:43,701 --> 02:21:47,090
but the Fort Lauderdale Improv is one of
my favorite places to perform.

3107
02:21:47,091 --> 02:21:48,110
Yeah.
It's a fun place to.

3108
02:21:48,260 --> 02:21:49,093
While I'm especially if you like drunks 
that are trying to escape from New 

3109
02:21:50,990 --> 02:21:51,823
Jersey while we're plugging things,
because Brendan Schaub will beat me up 

3110
02:21:53,721 --> 02:21:58,721
if I don't mention that fighter and kid 
live will be in West Palm Beach November

3111
02:22:00,651 --> 02:22:02,900
11th and twelfth and in New York.

3112
02:22:02,910 --> 02:22:07,220
Gramsci Hall.
I think we're almost sold out a November

3113
02:22:07,370 --> 02:22:08,990
third.
Excellent.

3114
02:22:08,991 --> 02:22:10,370
Some CS.
Go see them.

3115
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:11,233
Hilarious show.
My netflix special comes out this 

3116
02:22:12,951 --> 02:22:15,350
Friday,
October 21st.

3117
02:22:17,210 --> 02:22:19,140
So available for download.
A.

3118
02:22:19,370 --> 02:22:21,140
People have been asking if you can get 
it in other countries.

3119
02:22:21,141 --> 02:22:21,974
That's a real good question.
I will ask that myself and I'll find 

3120
02:22:23,571 --> 02:22:24,404
out.
I'll get back to you.

3121
02:22:24,850 --> 02:22:25,683
You know,
since you told me about dairy and not 

3122
02:22:27,571 --> 02:22:29,050
putting it in your coughing.
Uh,

3123
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:33,800
I have not had the same throat issues.
Issues.

3124
02:22:33,890 --> 02:22:36,000
What kind of.
Well apparently,

3125
02:22:36,001 --> 02:22:36,834
and I didn't know this,
but Brendan told me that I was always 

3126
02:22:38,971 --> 02:22:40,040
going.
Yeah,

3127
02:22:40,120 --> 02:22:40,751
no,
definitely.

3128
02:22:40,751 --> 02:22:43,350
And my wife said the same thing.
I was doing that with butter coffee.

3129
02:22:43,650 --> 02:22:45,330
I switched.
If you hear it and you say,

3130
02:22:45,331 --> 02:22:46,164
Hey,
I don't hear you clear your throat as 

3131
02:22:46,921 --> 02:22:47,754
much,
you're always going to have to clear 

3132
02:22:47,971 --> 02:22:48,630
your throat when you talk.

3133
02:22:48,630 --> 02:22:51,690
As much as I do a lot of bullshit coming
out of my mouth.

3134
02:22:51,930 --> 02:22:55,130
I got gotta,
but I drink black coffee now.

3135
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:56,753
During the podcast I'll still drink 
coffee with a grass fed butter and mct 

3136
02:23:00,031 --> 02:23:01,750
oil,
but I don't drink it before podcast.

3137
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:03,900
I don't drink it during a podcast I 
should say.

3138
02:23:04,110 --> 02:23:04,943
Some people get bummed out like Steven l
he lives with that shit when he comes 

3139
02:23:07,081 --> 02:23:08,280
in,
he's gonna come in and a couple of weeks

3140
02:23:08,281 --> 02:23:10,560
we have to give it to him because he'll 
be sad.

3141
02:23:10,830 --> 02:23:11,663
He'll be sad.
Well there's nothing like really good 

3142
02:23:12,541 --> 02:23:13,374
coffee with,
but I can't do any kind of a cow dairy 

3143
02:23:16,681 --> 02:23:18,220
anymore.
I liked.

3144
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:20,490
I know you said that you let you like 
goat milk,

3145
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:23,550
goat milk to raw milk and I like butter.
Butter.

3146
02:23:23,551 --> 02:23:24,630
I can kill.
I love butter.

3147
02:23:24,670 --> 02:23:26,070
I'll tell you when my daughter was 
little,

3148
02:23:26,670 --> 02:23:27,530
she could not.

3149
02:23:27,550 --> 02:23:28,920
She,
if she drank milk at all,

3150
02:23:28,921 --> 02:23:30,720
she would throw up when she was really 
little.

3151
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:31,920
I could not drink milk.
We try,

3152
02:23:32,110 --> 02:23:32,943
you know,
it's hard to gauge when you have a 

3153
02:23:34,321 --> 02:23:35,400
little kid,
see what they like,

3154
02:23:35,401 --> 02:23:39,150
what they don't like and what a.
But goat milk went down like that.

3155
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:40,980
Like nothing.
It was really interesting.

3156
02:23:41,150 --> 02:23:41,983
She was,
I mean we're talking like she was a 

3157
02:23:42,391 --> 02:23:43,224
really young baby.
She loved goat milk and for whatever 

3158
02:23:46,201 --> 02:23:49,050
reason we stopped buying it and now we 
buy just regular cow's milk.

3159
02:23:49,110 --> 02:23:53,760
They didn't really enchanting experiment
with with goats and kind of proving that

3160
02:23:53,761 --> 02:23:57,960
when you eat a food that's super 
delicious,

3161
02:23:57,961 --> 02:24:00,150
like say you eat a peach and you love 
peaches,

3162
02:24:00,330 --> 02:24:02,220
then you meet another peach and you love
peaches,

3163
02:24:02,221 --> 02:24:03,054
but there's somewhere along the line 
where with foods that are also giving 

3164
02:24:05,481 --> 02:24:07,500
you nutrition,
you stopped as a trigger.

3165
02:24:07,950 --> 02:24:12,090
So whereas when you flavor food that 
doesn't have any nutritional value,

3166
02:24:12,091 --> 02:24:13,500
you'll just keep eating it.
Like to read us.

3167
02:24:13,501 --> 02:24:14,334
You keep eating,
keep eating and keeping and it tricks 

3168
02:24:16,141 --> 02:24:17,970
your body,
but there's something about this guy did

3169
02:24:17,980 --> 02:24:18,813
this experiment where this professor at 
the university took these goats and he 

3170
02:24:22,441 --> 02:24:24,870
starved them a phosphorous.
You didn't get many phosphorous in their

3171
02:24:24,871 --> 02:24:25,704
diet and they started doing weird things
like drinking their own urine and 

3172
02:24:27,541 --> 02:24:28,374
drinking each other's urine and pawn at 
the dirt and weird shit because they 

3173
02:24:30,121 --> 02:24:35,121
need phosphorous.
So then he would feed them two different

3174
02:24:35,590 --> 02:24:37,230
samples of food,
but the coconut,

3175
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:40,080
the coconut flavored,
and there was maple flavored food.

3176
02:24:40,330 --> 02:24:42,360
Uh,
and so the coconut flavored food,

3177
02:24:42,361 --> 02:24:44,430
when he'd feed them the coconut flavored
food,

3178
02:24:44,890 --> 02:24:45,723
uh,
then he would put a tube down their 

3179
02:24:46,911 --> 02:24:49,320
throat and fill their stomachs with the 
phosphorous.

3180
02:24:49,980 --> 02:24:50,813
And all of a sudden the goats were 
instinctively going for the coconut 

3181
02:24:54,841 --> 02:24:55,631
flavored food.
Now,

3182
02:24:55,631 --> 02:24:56,780
the,
the thing you'd say is,

3183
02:24:56,790 --> 02:24:57,271
well,
wait a minute,

3184
02:24:57,271 --> 02:24:58,770
maybe they just like coconut flavored 
food.

3185
02:24:58,980 --> 02:25:01,920
But then he took the maple flavored food
and the coconut flavor food,

3186
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:04,800
another control group.
And when those goats would eat the maple

3187
02:25:04,801 --> 02:25:05,634
food,
he'd stick the tube down their throat 

3188
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:11,970
and fill their stomachs with phosphorus.
Now the goats didn't know that they were

3189
02:25:11,971 --> 02:25:12,804
getting.
And so that control group would always 

3190
02:25:15,091 --> 02:25:17,250
go for the maple.
Whoa.

3191
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:18,113
Because they could,
even though they didn't know they are 

3192
02:25:19,441 --> 02:25:24,010
getting phosphorous,
they just somehow equated the

3193
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:26,910
fact that they were going to get the 
phosphorus from that.

3194
02:25:27,130 --> 02:25:30,400
So they think that human beings have 
this strange mechanism in their,

3195
02:25:30,490 --> 02:25:33,580
in their sort of brain and body where 
they,

3196
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:38,350
once you are eating a food that has 
nutritional value,

3197
02:25:38,351 --> 02:25:39,184
so if it's sweet like dates,
it's got nutritional value as well or 

3198
02:25:42,191 --> 02:25:43,024
whatever it might be.
Somewhere online we get satiated no 

3199
02:25:45,071 --> 02:25:47,650
matter how delicious we find it,
if it's a natural foods.

3200
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:49,720
True.
Because nobody eats like a giant bowl of

3201
02:25:49,721 --> 02:25:50,650
peaches.
Yeah.

3202
02:25:51,490 --> 02:25:54,370
You might eat two of your crazy right 
and this,

3203
02:25:54,371 --> 02:25:56,260
but you'll eat a fucking pie.
Fuck yeah.

3204
02:25:56,261 --> 02:25:58,560
You lead a buyer,
you'll lead with ice cream.

3205
02:25:58,561 --> 02:25:59,394
You might eat that whole pie,
especially when it's artificially 

3206
02:26:00,611 --> 02:26:03,490
flavored.
That that triggers this weird.

3207
02:26:03,610 --> 02:26:04,443
And one of the things in this book,
Dorito effect is that this guy talks 

3208
02:26:06,551 --> 02:26:10,210
about the fact that that has kind of 
thrown our,

3209
02:26:10,270 --> 02:26:11,740
you know,
that that's one of the things,

3210
02:26:11,741 --> 02:26:14,050
one of the culprits of obesity perhaps.

3211
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:15,153
For sure.
Yeah,

3212
02:26:15,460 --> 02:26:16,570
for sure.
Flavoring,

3213
02:26:16,600 --> 02:26:17,433
flavoring for sure.
One hundred percent that totally makes 

3214
02:26:18,911 --> 02:26:20,200
sense.
And then the sugar thing.

3215
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:21,113
Yeah.
Chickens take chickens because we grow 

3216
02:26:23,561 --> 02:26:24,281
them so fast.
So,

3217
02:26:24,281 --> 02:26:27,880
so usually like after World War Two,
the fastest chicken they could grow,

3218
02:26:27,881 --> 02:26:30,580
they had a contest was to get it to the 
point where you could eat.

3219
02:26:30,581 --> 02:26:35,180
It was 14 weeks and now we've got it 
down to six weeks and yeah.

3220
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:37,210
So now you what you're eating his big 
fat babies.

3221
02:26:37,211 --> 02:26:38,830
The problem is that the oils aren't the 
same.

3222
02:26:38,831 --> 02:26:40,870
They're not as nutritious as an heirloom
chicken and chicken.

3223
02:26:40,871 --> 02:26:43,660
It's grown to eight when it far just 
like the chickens you have,

3224
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:47,100
they like worms and whatever they want.
I don't eat my chicken,

3225
02:26:47,101 --> 02:26:47,561
so.
Yeah.

3226
02:26:47,561 --> 02:26:51,050
But if you ate that chicken to be the 
oils and the meat would be different and

3227
02:26:51,051 --> 02:26:53,050
it'd be.
And it'd be also more flavorful.

3228
02:26:53,450 --> 02:26:56,110
Um,
but because chicken has no taste,

3229
02:26:56,111 --> 02:26:58,060
we had to figure out.
There's a lot of things you had to do to

3230
02:26:58,061 --> 02:26:59,800
a chicken to make it take.
You've got to Brian it,

3231
02:26:59,970 --> 02:27:01,720
you've got to flavor it.
You've got to do all kinds of shit.

3232
02:27:01,721 --> 02:27:02,554
And it was way better than children.
That wild Turkey that we shot with 

3233
02:27:04,661 --> 02:27:05,650
vanilla.
Fuck yeah,

3234
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:07,620
that was delicious.
I,

3235
02:27:07,621 --> 02:27:12,370
I cook that whole thing on the grill.
I marinated it in my standard marinade,

3236
02:27:12,580 --> 02:27:15,140
which is newman zone,
balsamic vinegarette taste.

3237
02:27:15,250 --> 02:27:17,620
Just marinate and everything in that.
So good.

3238
02:27:17,950 --> 02:27:19,510
Yeah.
The red beat,

3239
02:27:19,511 --> 02:27:23,570
the darker meat was different.
Like the breast plates of like the way a

3240
02:27:23,650 --> 02:27:25,540
Rinella did.
He breaded it and fried it.

3241
02:27:25,541 --> 02:27:26,374
And I used to do this good.
I used to joke about when we did our 

3242
02:27:29,081 --> 02:27:29,914
live podcast,
Brent and I about how I called it 

3243
02:27:31,781 --> 02:27:34,000
Rogan's gift when you bought me that bow
and arrow.

3244
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:36,620
And first I talked about when we hunted 
Turkey and I was like,

3245
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:40,300
kill a Turkey with dressed in the field 
map and we cut it and it was.

3246
02:27:40,301 --> 02:27:42,760
I mean I didn't shoot it,
but I've secured Joe's hips when he shot

3247
02:27:42,761 --> 02:27:44,350
the Turkey and I go,
we got it.

3248
02:27:44,380 --> 02:27:47,710
We brought it up and it tastes just like
Turkey,

3249
02:27:47,730 --> 02:27:48,660
you know,
and they don't lock.

3250
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:50,710
And then I go to this whole fucking 
thing.

3251
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:53,140
Remember when he gave me the bow and 
Arrow and I was like,

3252
02:27:53,470 --> 02:27:54,310
I looked at,
I was like,

3253
02:27:54,690 --> 02:27:56,860
I didn't know what to say because I 
don't know anything about boys,

3254
02:27:56,861 --> 02:27:58,810
but I think I saw the whole thing and I 
went,

3255
02:27:59,080 --> 02:28:02,770
got me a fucking hoyt and you were like 
carbon fiber.

3256
02:28:02,771 --> 02:28:04,700
I go,
whole thing,

3257
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:08,650
hundred percent carbon fiber.
Now you like trying to show somebody who

3258
02:28:08,651 --> 02:28:10,480
really appreciate the gift,
but you don't know what to say about it.

3259
02:28:10,770 --> 02:28:13,090
Fuck,
I can shoot one shot,

3260
02:28:13,150 --> 02:28:14,890
one Arrow because you want to have me 
over.

3261
02:28:14,980 --> 02:28:15,730
No,
you'd never.

3262
02:28:15,730 --> 02:28:18,130
You'd never organized it.
I'm not going to be the one who does all

3263
02:28:18,131 --> 02:28:20,210
the work.
You were so trusting.

3264
02:28:20,530 --> 02:28:22,160
The greatest is crazy.

3265
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:26,090
The fuck that.
The grant and Swiss you with that expert

3266
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:29,810
Guy Archer and the greatest tax was,
are you going to have me come over and I

3267
02:28:29,811 --> 02:28:32,030
was going to shoot with you guys.
You got so into it.

3268
02:28:32,031 --> 02:28:33,640
I got a text from you and you go,
hey brother,

3269
02:28:33,770 --> 02:28:34,603
this is not going to work today.
I got a lot of really important work to 

3270
02:28:35,950 --> 02:28:38,440
do with this guy.
You're so obsessed with it.

3271
02:28:38,441 --> 02:28:43,441
He told me we need it needs to.
You need to be looking at one person,

3272
02:28:43,910 --> 02:28:46,610
like if you're working with one person,
you're working on their archery form.

3273
02:28:46,660 --> 02:28:47,493
Oh,
if you're working on two people at the 

3274
02:28:48,381 --> 02:28:49,214
same time,
you're not even going to get half the 

3275
02:28:49,881 --> 02:28:50,714
work done with either.
That makes sense and he wants to do 

3276
02:28:52,101 --> 02:28:52,934
something with you and Brendan,
he wants to do something where he hooks 

3277
02:28:55,731 --> 02:28:57,160
you guys up with hoyt.

3278
02:28:57,270 --> 02:29:00,190
Both teaches you and you guys could all 
make a video.

3279
02:29:00,191 --> 02:29:02,810
It can make a video of you guys shooting
bows for the first time when.

3280
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:04,130
But he's like,
it has to like,

3281
02:29:04,210 --> 02:29:05,043
he's like,
I can't do that and work with you 

3282
02:29:05,811 --> 02:29:09,470
because work with me.
I'm many years advanced.

3283
02:29:09,530 --> 02:29:10,363
Not,
not saying that I'm really good because 

3284
02:29:10,971 --> 02:29:13,250
I'm not.
I'm so far advanced from you guys.

3285
02:29:13,251 --> 02:29:14,084
Like he would have to work with you.
So specifically on every little thing 

3286
02:29:16,791 --> 02:29:17,624
and there's so many different things you
have to think of when it takes a long 

3287
02:29:19,671 --> 02:29:22,550
fucking time.
Like give me an example of bone arrow.

3288
02:29:22,580 --> 02:29:26,060
So give me an example,
because I would imagine how you stand,

3289
02:29:26,061 --> 02:29:27,680
how you breathe,
how you pull back.

3290
02:29:27,740 --> 02:29:30,630
There's a ton of different things.
It's how you hold the bow.

3291
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:34,640
What technique used to draw back what 
muscles you're pulling with.

3292
02:29:34,641 --> 02:29:35,474
You have to be super conscious of 
pulling with the muscles and your 

3293
02:29:37,161 --> 02:29:37,820
scapula.

3294
02:29:37,820 --> 02:29:38,420
Like,
Whoa,

3295
02:29:38,420 --> 02:29:40,880
where's your elbow position?
How will you torquing the bow?

3296
02:29:40,890 --> 02:29:42,440
How are you gripping the bose,
the bow,

3297
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:45,320
crossing the lifeline on your hand.
If it is,

3298
02:29:45,321 --> 02:29:46,880
that's a problem.
You've got to readdress it.

3299
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:49,250
How you gripping it with your fingers.
Do you have a death grip?

3300
02:29:49,251 --> 02:29:50,084
Do you have a loose grip?
Is that affecting the actual trajectory 

3301
02:29:52,471 --> 02:29:54,380
of the Arrow is at torquing when you 
release it,

3302
02:29:54,381 --> 02:29:56,850
when you release it,
do you punch the triggers?

3303
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:59,790
The Arrow flying randomly left and 
right,

3304
02:29:59,791 --> 02:30:02,920
and all sorts of different directions.
There's so many forever.

3305
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:04,700
It takes forever.
It takes forever.

3306
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:07,880
And I'm not even like one 100 of the way
there,

3307
02:30:08,030 --> 02:30:10,640
but I'm three years ahead of you.
Do you think,

3308
02:30:10,910 --> 02:30:12,080
do you think that the,
uh,

3309
02:30:13,020 --> 02:30:13,853
here fucked?
Do you think that when you get really 

3310
02:30:17,631 --> 02:30:20,210
good at something like just take our 
trays and example,

3311
02:30:20,211 --> 02:30:22,730
I know there's a book called the archery
book,

3312
02:30:23,090 --> 02:30:27,470
but do you think that when you master 
something like archery,

3313
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:32,960
like do you think that's almost enough 
to learn about life or do you think that

3314
02:30:32,961 --> 02:30:34,370
that's a little bit romantic?

3315
02:30:34,580 --> 02:30:35,413
I think there are elements from anything
that you get really good at that apply 

3316
02:30:38,541 --> 02:30:40,880
to life.
The idea that learning something,

3317
02:30:40,881 --> 02:30:41,714
getting really good at it,
you learn about life has been disproved 

3318
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:44,953
over and over again by extreme winters 
who are gigantic fuck ups in their 

3319
02:30:47,571 --> 02:30:48,404
regular life.
I think when you get obsessed with 

3320
02:30:50,331 --> 02:30:53,270
something to the point of excellence to 
the point where you're the best at it or

3321
02:30:53,271 --> 02:30:56,930
one of the best added or you're in the 
running to be one of the best at in your

3322
02:30:56,931 --> 02:30:57,764
fucking brain does not have much room 
for a lot of the normal shit that 

3323
02:31:00,831 --> 02:31:02,720
everybody else has stuffed in their 
head.

3324
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:03,793
You're not going to be online on forums,
gossiping about celebrity bullshit or 

3325
02:31:08,090 --> 02:31:08,923
you know,
talking shit about the latest movie or 

3326
02:31:10,491 --> 02:31:11,324
talking shit about the latest song.
You will be obsessed with one task and 

3327
02:31:16,251 --> 02:31:18,440
that does not necessarily make you a 
balance person.

3328
02:31:18,530 --> 02:31:19,363
You might not have time for your family.
You might have time to talk to your 

3329
02:31:21,571 --> 02:31:24,240
friends.
You might not have time to have friends.

3330
02:31:24,390 --> 02:31:27,180
I mean you might be in recovery 
training.

3331
02:31:27,181 --> 02:31:28,014
You might be doing a million different 
things to try to accentuate your 

3332
02:31:30,421 --> 02:31:35,421
abilities in basketball and primarily a 
male characteristic.

3333
02:31:35,850 --> 02:31:36,683
Of course,
that's a feature of the male brain and 

3334
02:31:37,790 --> 02:31:40,530
the ability to exclude everything else,
but one thing,

3335
02:31:40,650 --> 02:31:43,350
it's very rare in women,
but you see it and it's an aberration.

3336
02:31:43,351 --> 02:31:45,420
You see it.
A lot of women athletes you see in a lot

3337
02:31:45,421 --> 02:31:48,180
of women's superstar athletes for sure.
It's also much rarer.

3338
02:31:48,181 --> 02:31:49,070
Apparently,
I mean worse.

3339
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:51,480
Yeah,
well that's why when someone like Rhonda

3340
02:31:51,480 --> 02:31:52,770
Rousey comes along,
you go,

3341
02:31:52,771 --> 02:31:53,604
oh,
look at that.

3342
02:31:53,610 --> 02:31:54,690
There's one of those,
you know,

3343
02:31:54,691 --> 02:31:58,560
there's a female version of the super 
winter exists,

3344
02:31:58,950 --> 02:32:00,840
you know,
and they seek out male versions of those

3345
02:32:00,841 --> 02:32:04,410
super winters and you know,
they have super winter babies that's a,

3346
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:05,820
you know,
standard stuff,

3347
02:32:06,180 --> 02:32:07,710
but it's,
it's to me,

3348
02:32:07,890 --> 02:32:10,080
I don't think it's indicative of 
learning about life.

3349
02:32:10,110 --> 02:32:13,800
It's learning how to get really awesome 
at one thing and that might translate if

3350
02:32:13,801 --> 02:32:16,980
you can step away from the madness and 
the momentum of whatever the fuck it is.

3351
02:32:16,981 --> 02:32:17,814
You're obsessed with that ability to 
really completely focusing on one thing 

3352
02:32:20,821 --> 02:32:24,660
might aid you if you can completely 
focus in on life,

3353
02:32:25,050 --> 02:32:29,520
but the idea that an athlete or an 
archer or anybody else is doing anything

3354
02:32:29,521 --> 02:32:31,680
obsessive,
Lee is actually focusing on life.

3355
02:32:33,270 --> 02:32:35,120
That's,
that might not be the case.

3356
02:32:35,420 --> 02:32:36,690
That's a good point.
I never thought of that.

3357
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:37,553
That's a good way to articulate because 
even like you see like great artists 

3358
02:32:40,410 --> 02:32:41,680
like Paul Jackson,
pollock,

3359
02:32:41,681 --> 02:32:42,220
whoever they were,
they,

3360
02:32:42,220 --> 02:32:43,890
they weren't that happy.
I mean they,

3361
02:32:43,891 --> 02:32:44,581
they,
you know,

3362
02:32:44,581 --> 02:32:45,920
a lot of that,
a lot of examples of like,

3363
02:32:46,470 --> 02:32:47,303
you know,
great authors are great artists or 

3364
02:32:48,511 --> 02:32:49,281
whoever they are,
and they,

3365
02:32:49,281 --> 02:32:50,114
they were so obsessed with their 
expression that they also live 

3366
02:32:52,841 --> 02:32:53,640
depressive lives now.

3367
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:54,473
Whether or not whether or not though 
depressives tend to obsess might be 

3368
02:33:00,691 --> 02:33:03,450
another question,
but that's probably both.

3369
02:33:03,510 --> 02:33:05,720
Both things are probably true.
You know,

3370
02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:06,593
I was a giant prince fan still am.
He was like one of my all time favorite 

3371
02:33:10,111 --> 02:33:12,260
musical artists.
So you know,

3372
02:33:12,300 --> 02:33:13,133
when I found out that prince had all 
these issues with his health and he's 

3373
02:33:16,411 --> 02:33:18,930
taking pain pills and he was addicted to
pain pills,

3374
02:33:19,230 --> 02:33:20,940
it was almost like in denial about it.
I was like,

3375
02:33:20,941 --> 02:33:22,380
no,
that guy's too smart for that.

3376
02:33:22,410 --> 02:33:24,990
Like that guy is like,
he's smarter than the system.

3377
02:33:24,991 --> 02:33:25,824
We figured out how to make a symbol to 
get out of a contract because he had to 

3378
02:33:27,871 --> 02:33:28,704
use his name.
So he was the artist formerly known as 

3379
02:33:30,481 --> 02:33:31,980
Prince and became a mean.
That was what.

3380
02:33:31,981 --> 02:33:33,210
That was all bad.
They will look,

3381
02:33:33,211 --> 02:33:34,110
you can't use the name Prince.

3382
02:33:34,110 --> 02:33:34,531
It's like,
oh,

3383
02:33:34,531 --> 02:33:37,050
for real motherfucker.
Do you know how famous I am?

3384
02:33:37,290 --> 02:33:38,580
I'll make a symbol.
I'll be,

3385
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:39,473
I'll just be assembled locks this and.
But then when you hear prints like 

3386
02:33:42,870 --> 02:33:44,100
interviewed,
which you rarely do,

3387
02:33:44,190 --> 02:33:45,690
you see as art,
which is amazing.

3388
02:33:45,691 --> 02:33:47,000
You know,
I still to this day,

3389
02:33:47,001 --> 02:33:48,670
I think the purple rain,
you know,

3390
02:33:48,690 --> 02:33:50,610
like it's one of the greatest songs when
the greatest.

3391
02:33:50,611 --> 02:33:53,550
It was a great movie musical album.
Yeah,

3392
02:33:53,551 --> 02:33:54,384
let's go crazy.
I mean he had some fucking jams and in 

3393
02:33:57,211 --> 02:34:01,470
that time he was revolutionary.
He's just weird little androgynous guy.

3394
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:03,390
And then just like the whole thing was 
crazy.

3395
02:34:03,391 --> 02:34:07,090
The dancing is like hair.
Oh my God,

3396
02:34:07,300 --> 02:34:08,680
I should have known.
Oh my God.

3397
02:34:08,681 --> 02:34:12,720
The way,
ways that it wouldn't last.

3398
02:34:14,490 --> 02:34:17,500
And he had that hair all done up at a 
high stiletto heels.

3399
02:34:17,501 --> 02:34:18,010
It was amazing.

3400
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:19,270
My friend,
my friend Tommy,

3401
02:34:19,271 --> 02:34:23,920
I'll never forget my friend Tommy goes,
he's so fucking gay.

3402
02:34:24,690 --> 02:34:28,540
And then he goes in there and he goes,
but he's fucking awesome.

3403
02:34:29,420 --> 02:34:31,440
While he wasn't gay,
it wasn't good.

3404
02:34:31,441 --> 02:34:34,210
He was heterosexual and he wasn't even 
really like gay people.

3405
02:34:34,630 --> 02:34:37,150
That's one of the weirdest jobs is 
witnessed and it was.

3406
02:34:37,180 --> 02:34:40,570
He kind of said some homophobic shit 
that people get really mad at him about,

3407
02:34:40,930 --> 02:34:43,330
about one of the reasons he was trying 
to equate,

3408
02:34:43,331 --> 02:34:44,164
okay,
stop.

3409
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:45,273
He was trying to equate all of these 
different things that were going on in 

3410
02:34:48,161 --> 02:34:52,060
the world with people not following 
God's way and sticking their dick in any

3411
02:34:52,061 --> 02:34:53,740
place they want and people are like,
Whoa,

3412
02:34:53,741 --> 02:34:54,131
whoa,
Whoa,

3413
02:34:54,131 --> 02:34:55,200
whoa.
Did you just say that?

3414
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:56,800
Did you just say that?
Yeah,

3415
02:34:56,950 --> 02:34:58,180
let's go crazy.
You're the guy.

3416
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:01,030
The fucking addresses in purple and 
talks about being a pervert,

3417
02:35:01,220 --> 02:35:02,053
but he's very,
very conservative and a lot of ways 

3418
02:35:03,051 --> 02:35:03,340
wasn't it?

3419
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:07,180
But what were you saying about to say is
that he also was into chem trails.

3420
02:35:07,450 --> 02:35:08,283
He also believed that the government was
spraying the sky and that's what was 

3421
02:35:09,941 --> 02:35:13,300
making everybody angry.
So when you listened to him talk and you

3422
02:35:13,301 --> 02:35:15,140
hear him like discuss things,
you'll realize,

3423
02:35:15,220 --> 02:35:18,390
oh,
okay,

3424
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:19,810
what?
What he said about Kennedy.

3425
02:35:19,811 --> 02:35:20,644
I was funny.
He said,

3426
02:35:21,010 --> 02:35:21,843
you know,
what I've noticed is that when a plane 

3427
02:35:23,501 --> 02:35:24,334
would go by and you'd see these trails 
and everybody started acting crazy and 

3428
02:35:27,551 --> 02:35:29,890
they'd be fighting and I'm all I'm 
saying is take a look at it,

3429
02:35:30,040 --> 02:35:31,330
just take a look at it.
And I was like,

3430
02:35:31,450 --> 02:35:32,290
I won't,
I won't,

3431
02:35:32,500 --> 02:35:35,470
I won't take a right here.
I love you as a musical genius.

3432
02:35:35,471 --> 02:35:36,304
I won't take a look at it,
but there's also a problem that when he 

3433
02:35:38,051 --> 02:35:42,580
said that he was probably 50 and when he
got famous he was probably 20,

3434
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:43,713
so 30 years of being completely 
insulated and isolated people kissing 

3435
02:35:48,041 --> 02:35:48,874
your ass and you saying a bunch of 
poetic shit while you were alone in 

3436
02:35:52,241 --> 02:35:55,240
Minneapolis and he did right.

3437
02:35:55,240 --> 02:35:58,170
Myopic enough to never read a newspaper 
or anything.

3438
02:35:58,171 --> 02:35:59,020
I mean,
no,

3439
02:35:59,170 --> 02:36:00,760
I don't know.
I don't know what he was like.

3440
02:36:00,820 --> 02:36:02,860
I don't know what he was looking for.
That's what he was like,

3441
02:36:02,861 --> 02:36:04,050
because I know,
I know somebody.

3442
02:36:04,070 --> 02:36:06,680
My friend's brother was in his band.
Really?

3443
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:07,553
Yes.
Your friend's brother taught with 

3444
02:36:08,300 --> 02:36:09,710
prince,
my friend Rico.

3445
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:13,320
Somehow many different types of aids.
Did he get well?

3446
02:36:13,450 --> 02:36:14,251
Uh,
no,

3447
02:36:14,251 --> 02:36:18,430
he rica simone was just wonderful guy 
who died of colon cancer and his brother

3448
02:36:18,790 --> 02:36:22,330
fucking what was his name?
His brother toward prints and,

3449
02:36:22,780 --> 02:36:26,590
and he knew prince and man,
that dude was,

3450
02:36:26,890 --> 02:36:27,723
he did,
he really did play every instrument 

3451
02:36:29,291 --> 02:36:32,660
fluently and he had high standards and,
and he's just a,

3452
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:33,880
like,
nobody worked like him.

3453
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:36,910
No body but it,
it required almost all of them,

3454
02:36:36,911 --> 02:36:37,720
right?
I mean it just,

3455
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:40,530
it.
He was so devoted to just music and well

3456
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:41,860
it's obvious.

3457
02:36:42,280 --> 02:36:43,330
I mean his,
he was,

3458
02:36:43,360 --> 02:36:46,840
his style was so diverse.
You just mixed it up a lot,

3459
02:36:47,100 --> 02:36:49,240
you know,
he would like remember raspberry beret.

3460
02:36:49,610 --> 02:36:51,310
It comes out of nowhere.
I mean he,

3461
02:36:51,320 --> 02:36:52,153
he was different when he's saying that 
Tom Jones cover and that high operatic 

3462
02:36:56,261 --> 02:36:58,010
voice,
you know,

3463
02:36:58,270 --> 02:36:59,103
I,
I didn't meet him but I stood next to 

3464
02:37:00,371 --> 02:37:02,260
him at a party.
Prince,

3465
02:37:02,300 --> 02:37:03,610
do you?
No.

3466
02:37:03,611 --> 02:37:05,560
Prince,
do you know how small he was?

3467
02:37:05,590 --> 02:37:08,230
How small was it?
I'm going to go ahead and say,

3468
02:37:08,890 --> 02:37:13,890
and I don't care if NASA comes and shows
me like his measurements.

3469
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:16,620
He under five feet tall.
Really?

3470
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:19,700
And I'm not kidding,
he was straight up under five feet tall.

3471
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:20,983
I couldn't.
He was in high heels and I couldn't 

3472
02:37:22,191 --> 02:37:23,024
believe how small he was white and he 
walked by me twice and then he was 

3473
02:37:26,151 --> 02:37:28,640
standing in a group and I was,
I was,

3474
02:37:28,650 --> 02:37:29,483
they're invisible because everybody else
was way too famous and I just kept 

3475
02:37:32,391 --> 02:37:33,224
looking at him and I was like,
don't stare at a print stuff staring 

3476
02:37:34,470 --> 02:37:35,780
prince neck normally you fucking 
asshole.

3477
02:37:36,140 --> 02:37:39,740
He was a,
just a little bit above a dwarf.

3478
02:37:40,050 --> 02:37:40,883
Wow.
For Real.

3479
02:37:41,450 --> 02:37:44,570
He was absolutely tiny.
Shockingly.

3480
02:37:44,620 --> 02:37:47,090
You think you the most pussy ever for a 
little tiny guy?

3481
02:37:48,230 --> 02:37:50,120
Probably don't know what his sex life 
was.

3482
02:37:50,121 --> 02:37:51,260
I don't know.
You know,

3483
02:37:51,261 --> 02:37:53,240
who knows?
Used to bank Carmen Electra,

3484
02:37:53,241 --> 02:37:54,074
right?
I know he wrote a lot of songs for 

3485
02:37:55,551 --> 02:37:56,384
people.
I don't know.

3486
02:37:56,630 --> 02:37:58,310
I was never in the room.
I don't know.

3487
02:37:58,311 --> 02:38:00,270
I shouldn't say bang.
I worked with Carmen Electra.

3488
02:38:00,620 --> 02:38:01,700
I did too.
What a doll.

3489
02:38:01,770 --> 02:38:03,440
She's pretty such a cool,
very nice.

3490
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:04,313
She's fun.
It was friendly and professional and I 

3491
02:38:06,710 --> 02:38:07,543
wonder why she hasn't.
She's a good person to probably just 

3492
02:38:09,381 --> 02:38:10,820
chilling.
I wish good things.

3493
02:38:11,300 --> 02:38:15,260
Do you read this year?
So I'm a good guy.

3494
02:38:15,261 --> 02:38:16,094
Here's his job.
I was doing a series that I thought was 

3495
02:38:18,501 --> 02:38:20,420
going gonna make me a star yet.
Another disappointment.

3496
02:38:20,421 --> 02:38:22,320
Yet another disappointment with 
gentleman.

3497
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:24,830
I was doing fed actress.
Oh yeah,

3498
02:38:24,831 --> 02:38:26,220
man,
I remember when you were high on that.

3499
02:38:26,590 --> 02:38:29,390
He lost a lot of weight.
I got a lot of attention for that.

3500
02:38:29,420 --> 02:38:30,390
And then,
uh,

3501
02:38:31,100 --> 02:38:32,810
was Christie.
Allie was like,

3502
02:38:32,811 --> 02:38:33,644
inner peak,
but I hadn't famous Broadway directors 

3503
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:36,953
calling me,
telling me I was great on the show and 

3504
02:38:37,551 --> 02:38:38,384
they wanted to put me in their plant.
I was so excited when they trying to 

3505
02:38:39,771 --> 02:38:43,310
fuck you or they're just trying to get 
some Dick.

3506
02:38:43,470 --> 02:38:44,560
No,
no,

3507
02:38:44,570 --> 02:38:46,850
probably not.
I wish I'm not that good looking.

3508
02:38:47,060 --> 02:38:48,350
What happened?
That was a showtime show,

3509
02:38:48,351 --> 02:38:50,630
wasn't it?
It was a big deal because of the name.

3510
02:38:50,660 --> 02:38:52,250
It was like very controversial.
Like wow,

3511
02:38:52,251 --> 02:38:54,080
she's so bold.
That name.

3512
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:55,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

3513
02:38:55,780 --> 02:38:58,130
Since she was like one of the first 
people to have like a,

3514
02:38:58,140 --> 02:38:58,973
a great sense of humor.
She's about eating herself into a 

3515
02:39:01,881 --> 02:39:02,810
bizarre shape.

3516
02:39:03,020 --> 02:39:05,480
She's just,
she's smart and a force of nature.

3517
02:39:06,990 --> 02:39:10,130
She's a scientologist in her house,
her house many times,

3518
02:39:10,131 --> 02:39:13,190
and she had so many animals.
She had to blind lemurs.

3519
02:39:13,370 --> 02:39:14,660
You know,
Christie would be the one who was like,

3520
02:39:14,661 --> 02:39:16,400
you got a blind monkey.
I'll take it.

3521
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:17,533
She had a rabbit,
a giant desert hair that couldn't use 

3522
02:39:19,570 --> 02:39:21,080
the back.
Its back legs.

3523
02:39:21,081 --> 02:39:24,200
Do you not feel the need to temper?
She's so smart with.

3524
02:39:24,230 --> 02:39:25,700
She's a scientologist.
Well,

3525
02:39:25,701 --> 02:39:28,910
having read,
going clear as you have a.

3526
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:32,990
and having been in class for over 10 
years with many scientologists.

3527
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:36,290
So I remember the class that was 
mentioned in that book.

3528
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:37,273
I remember when I used to go visit you.
Do you remember when you and I went to 

3529
02:39:40,251 --> 02:39:42,790
watch a guy sing songs?
Yes,

3530
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:43,993
and he was fantastic.
He was wonderful and hassles and his 

3531
02:39:46,970 --> 02:39:48,710
shoes,
his choice.

3532
02:39:48,980 --> 02:39:50,400
He said something interesting about it.

3533
02:39:50,400 --> 02:39:52,380
He'd been scientologist for 20 years and
go,

3534
02:39:52,400 --> 02:39:54,680
he call and he said,
I have a scientologist did.

3535
02:39:54,700 --> 02:39:55,670
Somebody asked me that.
He said,

3536
02:39:55,790 --> 02:39:59,030
let me just let me put this to rest as 
I'm a member of the church.

3537
02:39:59,150 --> 02:40:00,050
Tells you what does that mean.
I,

3538
02:40:00,060 --> 02:40:04,130
I've taken a lot of classes there and 
I've got nothing out of a lot of classes

3539
02:40:04,131 --> 02:40:05,900
and some classes.
I've gotten a lot.

3540
02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:08,930
If you want to call me a scientologists 
then go ahead and then we just get to in

3541
02:40:08,931 --> 02:40:10,790
class.
He was a fucking great teacher,

3542
02:40:11,270 --> 02:40:12,360
but his.
I mean he's in a,

3543
02:40:12,361 --> 02:40:16,440
not A.
I think it makes him in Jeffrey Tambor,

3544
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:20,850
who's The star of transparent,
used to be a scientologist for years and

3545
02:40:20,851 --> 02:40:22,710
he quit and it's called.
He blew.

3546
02:40:22,830 --> 02:40:24,660
He ran.
He got out.

3547
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:26,940
Do you get in trouble when you do that?
No,

3548
02:40:26,941 --> 02:40:29,040
but there's David miscavige.

3549
02:40:29,210 --> 02:40:34,210
The secretive sort of leader has never 
been painted in a very favorable light.

3550
02:40:34,890 --> 02:40:37,170
Especially if you read that book.
I don't know though.

3551
02:40:37,380 --> 02:40:38,213
Yeah.
It seems like a naughty little group of 

3552
02:40:40,171 --> 02:40:41,790
humans.
It does.

3553
02:40:42,480 --> 02:40:43,870
It does,
but I'm.

3554
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:45,700
Allie was in that naughty little group 
of human.

3555
02:40:45,701 --> 02:40:46,380
Yeah,
like any,

3556
02:40:46,380 --> 02:40:47,970
like any group,
like any group,

3557
02:40:47,971 --> 02:40:51,280
anybody who belongs to any group,
you're going to have dogma.

3558
02:40:51,330 --> 02:40:53,670
You're going to.
You're going to need tradition and story

3559
02:40:53,671 --> 02:40:54,504
to to keep that group together.
You can't have a group without having 

3560
02:40:57,610 --> 02:41:01,530
stories written by a guy on a captain's 
outfit on with metals he gave himself.

3561
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:02,311
Yeah,
he was,

3562
02:41:02,311 --> 02:41:03,144
uh,
he was probably very crazy and crazy as 

3563
02:41:06,541 --> 02:41:07,890
fuck.
Apparently,

3564
02:41:07,891 --> 02:41:11,790
there's a great new documentary that 
I've been hearing about called Holy Hell

3565
02:41:12,120 --> 02:41:12,953
about some guy who got involved in some 
really nutty cult in 1985 and was in a 

3566
02:41:19,261 --> 02:41:20,094
cult for like 20 years and a documented 
a bunch of crazy shit and is going to 

3567
02:41:23,821 --> 02:41:25,140
put a documentary out about it.

3568
02:41:25,170 --> 02:41:26,110
Wow.
Yeah.

3569
02:41:26,111 --> 02:41:26,944
And the cult leader is apparently he hit
his past as a gay porn star and he was 

3570
02:41:31,260 --> 02:41:31,960
there.
He is at,

3571
02:41:31,960 --> 02:41:32,793
as we have the ABS on that guy,
but people are always going to be long 

3572
02:41:35,551 --> 02:41:36,340
to call.
People.

3573
02:41:36,340 --> 02:41:40,230
Always going to want to group up with 
their version of the truth.

3574
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:45,300
A documentary villain for the ages and 
unprecedented closeup look.

3575
02:41:45,301 --> 02:41:49,470
We watch with bated breath as the mask 
slowly,

3576
02:41:50,030 --> 02:41:51,750
slowly pulled away,
pulled off.

3577
02:41:51,960 --> 02:41:54,290
Um,
what I always thought baited was B,

3578
02:41:54,291 --> 02:41:56,460
a t be a t,
e d,

3579
02:41:56,461 --> 02:41:59,070
what does it even mean?
Baden Bat ed.

3580
02:41:59,090 --> 02:42:00,300
Bated breath.
Like,

3581
02:42:00,390 --> 02:42:01,223
oh,
I thought I thought that it was ba 

3582
02:42:02,690 --> 02:42:05,100
because bated breath,
I never knew what it meant,

3583
02:42:05,370 --> 02:42:08,670
and the in great suspense very anxiously
or excitedly,

3584
02:42:08,671 --> 02:42:10,890
he waited for a reply to his offered 
with bated breath.

3585
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:13,890
I never knew what the,
I knew what it implied,

3586
02:42:14,160 --> 02:42:14,993
you know,
that you waited and it was highly 

3587
02:42:16,711 --> 02:42:19,850
anticipating it,
but I never knew led.

3588
02:42:19,860 --> 02:42:20,693
It was spelled that way or what it was 
supposed to get out of weird words that 

3589
02:42:23,191 --> 02:42:25,230
you'll hear sometimes time ago.
Not a long,

3590
02:42:25,231 --> 02:42:25,980
like,
um,

3591
02:42:25,980 --> 02:42:28,980
I heard somebody use the word 
solipsistic and I was like,

3592
02:42:29,580 --> 02:42:30,600
yes,
of course.

3593
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:31,793
Yeah.
I've said I've got to go back to a 

3594
02:42:35,580 --> 02:42:37,990
definition on that one and I never did.
It just means.

3595
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:41,370
Has anything else ever baited?
Is it only bated breath?

3596
02:42:41,371 --> 02:42:43,590
I've only heard it used in context of 
bated breath,

3597
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:46,590
but it's not a weird,
that's a very bizarre word.

3598
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:50,280
If it's only used with breath,
that's it.

3599
02:42:50,610 --> 02:42:53,040
You know,
some people are so good with words.

3600
02:42:53,100 --> 02:42:53,933
Like I was listening to a,
I was reading the lyrics of Bob Dylan's 

3601
02:42:57,030 --> 02:42:58,860
a after we won a Nobel prize for 
literature.

3602
02:42:58,950 --> 02:42:59,783
Solipsistic solipsistic means means 
essentially that you can only be sure 

3603
02:43:03,631 --> 02:43:07,170
that you exist and you're not even sure 
anybody else use theory that the self is

3604
02:43:07,171 --> 02:43:09,660
all that can be known to exist.

3605
02:43:09,750 --> 02:43:10,920
Hmm.
That's a weird word.

3606
02:43:10,960 --> 02:43:14,410
It's a very limited view of the world 
killed Bob.

3607
02:43:14,411 --> 02:43:16,870
Dylan won't respond to them.
The people trying to give him his prize.

3608
02:43:17,380 --> 02:43:20,830
It's like Bob Dylan,
fuck off.

3609
02:43:20,860 --> 02:43:21,693
If you look at the lyrics of chimes of 
freedom and and look at what he was 

3610
02:43:25,721 --> 02:43:28,140
writing when he was in his twenties to 
take a look at an Indian.

3611
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:31,450
He had an interview I listened to and 
they were talking about these lyrics and

3612
02:43:31,451 --> 02:43:32,610
he said,
and that's something he said,

3613
02:43:32,620 --> 02:43:33,453
what do you mean?
He said,

3614
02:43:33,460 --> 02:43:35,800
I had no idea how I wrote that and I 
could never do it again.

3615
02:43:35,830 --> 02:43:38,170
That magic is gone.
And he says,

3616
02:43:38,171 --> 02:43:39,004
people look me up and they'll come out 
and asked me about organic farming and 

3617
02:43:41,441 --> 02:43:42,780
he goes,
what do you know about organic farming?

3618
02:43:42,790 --> 02:43:43,623
He was absolutely nothing.
They just put all this stuff on him 

3619
02:43:46,211 --> 02:43:49,090
because he was a great lyricist and a 
great thinker.

3620
02:43:49,090 --> 02:43:51,160
Obviously he wrote all along the 
watchtower.

3621
02:43:51,310 --> 02:43:52,450
Hell yeah,
he wrote,

3622
02:43:52,510 --> 02:43:53,343
he was such a fucking influence of 
springsteen was just doing a BBC 

3623
02:43:55,541 --> 02:43:56,374
interview and he said it was the first 
time I'd ever heard anybody describe 

3624
02:44:00,851 --> 02:44:01,684
America the way it really was looking at
as far between sundowns finished and 

3625
02:44:06,761 --> 02:44:09,580
midnights broken tool.
We ducked inside the doorway,

3626
02:44:09,610 --> 02:44:10,443
thunder crashing as majestic.
Bells of bolts struck shadows in the 

3627
02:44:13,421 --> 02:44:17,050
sounds seeming to be the chimes of 
freedom flashing.

3628
02:44:17,320 --> 02:44:17,771
Yeah.
He was,

3629
02:44:17,771 --> 02:44:20,140
uh,
an interesting voice of a generation.

3630
02:44:20,210 --> 02:44:22,660
Listen to this part,
flashing for the warriors whose strength

3631
02:44:22,661 --> 02:44:23,494
is not to fight flashing for the 
refugees on an unarmed road of flight 

3632
02:44:27,880 --> 02:44:31,750
and for each and every underdog soldier 
in the night as we gazed upon the chimes

3633
02:44:31,751 --> 02:44:32,584
of freedom flashing.
He's a young guy reading it because I 

3634
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:36,520
read a book.
What's that?

3635
02:44:36,521 --> 02:44:37,350
It's probably high as fuck.

3636
02:44:37,350 --> 02:44:39,130
And he ruined all those.
I don't think he was.

3637
02:44:39,250 --> 02:44:41,680
How dare you?
You don't think he was doing drugs?

3638
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:43,540
Bob Dylan?
Um,

3639
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:45,480
itch please.
I,

3640
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:46,300
I,
uh,

3641
02:44:46,300 --> 02:44:48,860
I think mom was doing drugs.
I don't,

3642
02:44:48,980 --> 02:44:49,813
I don't know.
I don't know enough about of Shit for 

3643
02:44:51,071 --> 02:44:52,290
sure.
That was.

3644
02:44:52,310 --> 02:44:55,900
He was smoking weed and Lsd for sure.
I would imagine.

3645
02:44:55,990 --> 02:44:56,470
Well,
La,

3646
02:44:56,470 --> 02:44:59,740
who's that rock historian who said that 
the rock and roll is the greatest.

3647
02:44:59,741 --> 02:45:00,574
When they were doing,
they were doing psychedelics and they 

3648
02:45:02,501 --> 02:45:05,800
were smoking weed and cocaine and heroin
came in.

3649
02:45:06,010 --> 02:45:09,070
It was when the music pat.
That's when Lou Reed and that's when all

3650
02:45:09,071 --> 02:45:10,870
those guys,
the Mamas and Papas and all those guys,

3651
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:12,730
you know,
after Haight Ashbury,

3652
02:45:12,731 --> 02:45:17,731
I think 1968 that that when when heroin 
and marijuana and cocaine came in,

3653
02:45:18,220 --> 02:45:20,750
the music basically died.
A lot of time was smoked.

3654
02:45:20,790 --> 02:45:21,623
Says according to Eric von Schmidt,
the early sixties contemporary of 

3655
02:45:24,221 --> 02:45:25,970
Dylan's in the Cambridge folk scene.

3656
02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:29,110
Cambridge folk scene.
Good Lord.

3657
02:45:29,560 --> 02:45:32,830
Smells like feet.
Where he dylan in a singing pow.

3658
02:45:32,831 --> 02:45:35,680
Richard Farina usually got together a 
lot of pot with smoke,

3659
02:45:35,681 --> 02:45:37,150
so yeah,
it was probably just doing a lot of pot,

3660
02:45:37,510 --> 02:45:38,343
but if they were doing a lot of pot,
I guarantee you they did some acid to 

3661
02:45:40,810 --> 02:45:41,643
get ahold of some mushrooms.
Psychedelics and we'd probably are not 

3662
02:45:44,411 --> 02:45:45,244
going to be your enemies as an artist,
but I would imagine heroin and cocaine 

3663
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:50,823
don't usually they.
When do you think it's going to come a 

3664
02:45:53,351 --> 02:45:57,790
day when we require that of politicians?
We require psychedelic experiences.

3665
02:45:57,791 --> 02:45:58,624
Like we require education.
When Bob Dylan turned the Beatles on to 

3666
02:46:01,391 --> 02:46:02,770
marijuana while you got them.
Hi,

3667
02:46:03,180 --> 02:46:04,560
this is outrageous.
Um,

3668
02:46:04,810 --> 02:46:08,050
when do you think it's going to be a 
requirement for politicians?

3669
02:46:08,051 --> 02:46:08,884
Like,
I think every politician should have a 

3670
02:46:09,711 --> 02:46:10,040
mushroom

3671
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:12,350
trip.
I don't think that's a lot to ask.

3672
02:46:12,380 --> 02:46:13,213
I think you should.
You should have to have survived us 

3673
02:46:16,190 --> 02:46:20,390
threshold braking experience,
a real breakthrough experience.

3674
02:46:20,540 --> 02:46:21,373
I would start with politicians having to
go to another country for awhile and 

3675
02:46:23,511 --> 02:46:26,090
just seeing how people keep them here at
dose him up.

3676
02:46:26,091 --> 02:46:27,110
Fuck all that.
Travel.

3677
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:29,410
Travel's dangerous doses.
Just doses.

3678
02:46:29,570 --> 02:46:30,403
Just,
just fucking put them in a room for a 

3679
02:46:31,671 --> 02:46:33,110
bunch of people are gonna.
Watch the doors.

3680
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:35,060
Keep them in place.
Turn the lights off.

3681
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:38,840
Keep keep them silent and just dose the 
shit out of them.

3682
02:46:38,900 --> 02:46:39,733
I just think we,
we all know everybody that's had one 

3683
02:46:43,270 --> 02:46:45,350
that knows that there's giant benefits 
to them,

3684
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:46,333
but it's poo pooed in society as being 
like a drug that's detrimental to your 

3685
02:46:49,671 --> 02:46:52,400
health.
It's detrimental to your,

3686
02:46:52,401 --> 02:46:57,401
your,
your function as a kid or you don't know

3687
02:46:57,561 --> 02:46:58,610
where that droves coming from.

3688
02:46:58,610 --> 02:47:01,640
So that's why change it.
It was legal,

3689
02:47:01,670 --> 02:47:04,670
used to be right and sure until Nixon 
that fuck.

3690
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:05,953
Nixon fucked up a lot of things.
People don't realize like when people 

3691
02:47:07,401 --> 02:47:08,990
were doing an ass in the fifties and 
sixties,

3692
02:47:09,220 --> 02:47:11,390
it wasn't even illegal.
You know,

3693
02:47:11,391 --> 02:47:13,640
there's a lot of stuff.
Marijuana was illegal,

3694
02:47:13,700 --> 02:47:16,190
but mushrooms weren't illegal until 
1970.

3695
02:47:16,220 --> 02:47:17,450
It's amazing.
Yeah,

3696
02:47:17,510 --> 02:47:18,343
it's crazy.
But there's still stuff that's not 

3697
02:47:19,370 --> 02:47:20,203
technically illegal.
That's way more powerful than that five 

3698
02:47:22,851 --> 02:47:26,480
methoxy DMT.
You used to be able to buy it.

3699
02:47:26,690 --> 02:47:29,750
Not for human consumption from chemical 
companies online.

3700
02:47:30,250 --> 02:47:34,040
He used to be able to buy like a fucking
coffee tumbler full of it.

3701
02:47:34,070 --> 02:47:34,790
Yeah.
I'm not joking.

3702
02:47:34,790 --> 02:47:37,640
You could smoke and meanwhile and 
effective dose.

3703
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:38,503
It's five Meo DMT is in more potent 
psychedelic ounce per ounce gram per 

3704
02:47:43,701 --> 02:47:47,270
gram than nn dmt.
It's the most potent,

3705
02:47:47,630 --> 02:47:50,300
it doesn't have the visuals,
so it doesn't give you the visuals,

3706
02:47:50,301 --> 02:47:51,650
but as far as like,
um,

3707
02:47:51,770 --> 02:47:53,990
effective dose,
it's the most potent,

3708
02:47:54,260 --> 02:47:58,160
so a small amount can get you fucked up 
and used to be able to buy that stuff.

3709
02:47:58,430 --> 02:47:59,780
Well,
pot was illegal.

3710
02:47:59,870 --> 02:48:04,490
You used to be able to buy five Meo dmt 
online and if you smoke did,

3711
02:48:04,491 --> 02:48:07,610
you just got shot through a cannon to 
the center of the universe.

3712
02:48:07,611 --> 02:48:08,444
We cease to exist,
the terrifying trip because you 

3713
02:48:10,971 --> 02:48:11,804
absolutely thought you were dead,
like you absolutely ceased to exist and 

3714
02:48:14,601 --> 02:48:19,040
you became one with everything and it's,
it's a very weird non visual experience.

3715
02:48:19,310 --> 02:48:23,150
Whereas DMT is filled with all these 
patterns and this beautiful feeling that

3716
02:48:23,151 --> 02:48:28,151
you get the five Meo dmt is like this 
powerful white geometry.

3717
02:48:28,941 --> 02:48:29,774
It's all just pale white and all these 
weird sort of microscopic fractal 

3718
02:48:34,461 --> 02:48:37,520
geometric patterns that are sort of 
dancing around you.

3719
02:48:37,521 --> 02:48:39,830
But one thing is invisible.
Like what do you,

3720
02:48:39,831 --> 02:48:42,560
what do you like about psychedelics?
What do you think,

3721
02:48:42,890 --> 02:48:45,410
um,
is typically the benefit of the second?

3722
02:48:45,430 --> 02:48:46,263
I think there's a lot of benefits to any
experience and extreme experiences give 

3723
02:48:50,601 --> 02:48:51,500
you more benefits.

3724
02:48:51,800 --> 02:48:56,800
You take in more data knowing that that 
psychedelic experience is possible.

3725
02:48:57,140 --> 02:48:59,600
Just knowing that that experience that 
you can hit,

3726
02:49:00,050 --> 02:49:02,390
you can hit that note that you can get 
into that,

3727
02:49:02,450 --> 02:49:04,550
that dimension,
wherever the fuck it is in a psychedelic

3728
02:49:04,551 --> 02:49:05,384
experience,
it makes you look at the that is 

3729
02:49:08,791 --> 02:49:11,340
unchanging around you without drugs and 
it makes you go,

3730
02:49:11,430 --> 02:49:12,263
oh well this isn't all there is.
Like there's another thing that you can 

3731
02:49:15,511 --> 02:49:16,344
get to really easily.
You can get to this other thing really 

3732
02:49:18,271 --> 02:49:23,271
easily and although it's not regular 
everyday drive through starbucks,

3733
02:49:23,461 --> 02:49:26,790
stuck in traffic,
waiting for your phone call,

3734
02:49:26,890 --> 02:49:29,340
so the alarm goes off in the morning.
You don't want to get up.

3735
02:49:29,341 --> 02:49:30,174
It's not that world,
but it's still an accessible world 

3736
02:49:32,761 --> 02:49:34,410
that's right there.
That's mindblowing.

3737
02:49:34,440 --> 02:49:36,520
Well,
I think what you said Eagle dissolvent,

3738
02:49:36,521 --> 02:49:40,800
but even prior to that is the idea that 
it shows you what is possible or what is

3739
02:49:40,801 --> 02:49:41,490
out there.

3740
02:49:41,490 --> 02:49:42,323
That's,
that's to me the most important element 

3741
02:49:45,961 --> 02:49:46,794
for change in a person's consciousness.
When you are shown that there is a 

3742
02:49:51,661 --> 02:49:55,410
higher bar or you're shown that there 
is,

3743
02:49:55,440 --> 02:49:56,273
there are other possibilities,
more illuminating possibilities because 

3744
02:49:59,011 --> 02:49:59,844
a lot of times you can live in a,
in a world where your vision of reality 

3745
02:50:03,601 --> 02:50:04,434
that's given to you and that's that 
you're privy to on a daily basis is so 

3746
02:50:08,101 --> 02:50:08,934
limited that you don't even.
You need to be shown that there is 

3747
02:50:12,150 --> 02:50:14,580
something higher to aspire to.
Yeah,

3748
02:50:14,610 --> 02:50:15,570
for sure.
You know what I'm saying?

3749
02:50:15,571 --> 02:50:16,404
And so I think that's kind of the value.
Maybe that's one of the biggest values 

3750
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:20,513
to quote unquote education or the 
biggest value to exposing yourself to 

3751
02:50:24,690 --> 02:50:25,523
experiences like you're talking about.
I think both of them are valid and both 

3752
02:50:28,741 --> 02:50:29,574
of them are important.
I think you should have like difficult 

3753
02:50:31,321 --> 02:50:31,750
tests.

3754
02:50:31,750 --> 02:50:33,840
I think it's probably good for people to
try to run a marathon.

3755
02:50:34,080 --> 02:50:36,240
I think that's good for people to try to
rock climb.

3756
02:50:36,241 --> 02:50:39,270
I think it's good for people to go on 
long difficult hikes.

3757
02:50:39,271 --> 02:50:40,104
I think you learn from that just like 
you learn from education and I don't 

3758
02:50:43,171 --> 02:50:45,330
think it's.
I don't think they're mutually exclusive

3759
02:50:45,331 --> 02:50:48,450
and I think they combined together for a
balanced person,

3760
02:50:48,720 --> 02:50:49,553
a person who tries to do and tries to 
accomplish difficult things along with 

3761
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:53,933
becoming educated.
The problem is that this whole 

3762
02:50:56,911 --> 02:50:57,744
competitive thing that arises amongst 
people where you want to be the best at 

3763
02:51:00,751 --> 02:51:04,560
something like we were talking about,
which sort of defines you in this way,

3764
02:51:04,561 --> 02:51:09,561
that requires a lot of tunnel vision and
it requires you to not be fully balanced

3765
02:51:10,381 --> 02:51:11,800
and not be.
You know,

3766
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:13,980
one of the things I had a problem with 
when I was teaching,

3767
02:51:14,040 --> 02:51:15,890
when I teach martial arts,
I,

3768
02:51:16,060 --> 02:51:16,893
I noticed that smart people were way 
more nervous before fights and I was 

3769
02:51:21,181 --> 02:51:22,014
like,
oh,

3770
02:51:22,140 --> 02:51:22,973
I see what's going on.

3771
02:51:23,220 --> 02:51:27,780
They are aware of the variables like 
whereas these dumb people that you would

3772
02:51:27,781 --> 02:51:29,750
teach or the people that weren't as 
smart awareness,

3773
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:30,593
curious,
they didn't have nearly as much of a 

3774
02:51:31,771 --> 02:51:33,240
problem with competing.
I'm like,

3775
02:51:33,241 --> 02:51:34,074
this is really fascinating.
Like this really smart people are aware 

3776
02:51:37,531 --> 02:51:39,840
of almost too much.
Yeah.

3777
02:51:39,841 --> 02:51:40,674
Well,
David Foster Wallace in this incredible 

3778
02:51:41,761 --> 02:51:44,040
essay called how Tracy Austin broke my 
heart.

3779
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:46,033
It was.
It's really story about Tracy Austin 

3780
02:51:47,251 --> 02:51:49,300
when she won Wimbledon at 14.
Oh,

3781
02:51:49,450 --> 02:51:54,450
and and he said then she wrote a book 
like on her experience and trying to get

3782
02:51:54,541 --> 02:51:57,180
a physical genius to describe what they 
do.

3783
02:51:57,270 --> 02:52:00,330
Part of the reason that they performed 
so well under pressure.

3784
02:52:00,331 --> 02:52:02,610
Sometimes it's not because they're dumb,
but their brain,

3785
02:52:02,880 --> 02:52:06,130
they don't have the kind of mine that a 
writer would have,

3786
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:06,963
which is to ask a thousand questions to 
be introspective to the point where 

3787
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:13,240
you're essentially neurotic or going 
around in a circle.

3788
02:52:13,241 --> 02:52:16,450
You can't have that.
You've got to be able to shut that down.

3789
02:52:16,451 --> 02:52:17,284
That's why when they ask great athletes 
to describe what was going on in their 

3790
02:52:20,171 --> 02:52:21,004
mind,
when they got that ball over the end 

3791
02:52:22,991 --> 02:52:23,824
zone,
it's invariably kind of disappointing 

3792
02:52:25,811 --> 02:52:27,490
because they never really know how to 
explain it.

3793
02:52:27,491 --> 02:52:28,324
What they say is,
I just knew I had to get the football 

3794
02:52:29,620 --> 02:52:32,230
cross line and we just executed and my 
team was there.

3795
02:52:32,440 --> 02:52:33,273
It's not hard.
I just did this thing recently about 

3796
02:52:35,411 --> 02:52:38,320
climbing this area of Yosemite that's 
incredibly different.

3797
02:52:38,440 --> 02:52:40,040
Difficult to pass.
What is,

3798
02:52:40,130 --> 02:52:40,963
what is it?
It's.

3799
02:52:41,050 --> 02:52:42,670
It's just.
It was just released.

3800
02:52:42,760 --> 02:52:45,550
I think the video is called heaven 
something heaven.

3801
02:52:45,970 --> 02:52:48,460
Alex honnold heaven.
I bet it's very.

3802
02:52:48,461 --> 02:52:52,780
He's talking about as he's moving and 
he's doing these years.

3803
02:52:52,810 --> 02:52:55,450
I'm not thinking about anything.
I'm just executing and he goes,

3804
02:52:55,451 --> 02:52:59,380
I'm just executing the movements and 
he's literally upside down climbing this

3805
02:52:59,381 --> 02:53:01,140
thing thousands of feet up in the air.
It's.

3806
02:53:01,390 --> 02:53:02,223
It's horrific.
When you watch them do that and you're 

3807
02:53:04,001 --> 02:53:04,391
like,
well,

3808
02:53:04,391 --> 02:53:05,224
I dunno.
I mean I guess he knows what he's doing 

3809
02:53:07,660 --> 02:53:10,510
and he's done it before,
but when you watch him do it,

3810
02:53:10,990 --> 02:53:11,823
he free Solos.
Heaven that's experiential is hard to 

3811
02:53:15,281 --> 02:53:16,150
put into words,
right?

3812
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:17,240
I mean he's,
he's,

3813
02:53:17,240 --> 02:53:21,960
he's the ultimate experiential guru.
A guy who you.

3814
02:53:21,970 --> 02:53:24,820
But look what he's doing.
Oh my God is not using.

3815
02:53:24,900 --> 02:53:26,170
Oh No.
He doesn't use any ropes.

3816
02:53:27,240 --> 02:53:27,940
You look at.
No,

3817
02:53:27,940 --> 02:53:29,440
it's heaven.
This is what it's called.

3818
02:53:29,441 --> 02:53:32,320
But if you,
if you see how he's climbing this thing,

3819
02:53:32,720 --> 02:53:34,270
this,
this one area.

3820
02:53:34,271 --> 02:53:35,810
I don't know what mountain is that?
These are.

3821
02:53:35,890 --> 02:53:37,390
Maybe it is El Capitan.
Is that?

3822
02:53:37,570 --> 02:53:39,910
I think that's El Capitan.
I think that's all cat.

3823
02:53:40,310 --> 02:53:43,270
But anyway,
what he's doing is he's climbing up.

3824
02:53:43,590 --> 02:53:47,050
If it's not straight,
it's leaned back.

3825
02:53:47,410 --> 02:53:48,243
So he's hanging as he's climbing and 
he's climbing thousands of feet above 

3826
02:53:54,941 --> 02:53:56,380
the ground,
like look at the trees below him there.

3827
02:53:56,620 --> 02:53:57,453
Look at that fucking picture.
When they find guys that fall off El 

3828
02:54:00,510 --> 02:54:01,343
Cap,
they can't really find much of their 

3829
02:54:01,841 --> 02:54:02,674
body apparently.
Find out if that's the name of this 

3830
02:54:03,941 --> 02:54:07,090
thing,
how many pull ups can he do?

3831
02:54:07,091 --> 02:54:09,610
Did you ask him to do that?
I want to know.

3832
02:54:09,940 --> 02:54:10,960
I don't know.
Maybe you told me.

3833
02:54:11,050 --> 02:54:15,520
I'm so nervous.
He didn't say what the mountain is.

3834
02:54:16,480 --> 02:54:18,150
It's.
I think it's Yosemite.

3835
02:54:18,160 --> 02:54:20,620
Just carry a small shoot on the back of 
his body.

3836
02:54:20,621 --> 02:54:23,700
Please just go.
Yeah.

3837
02:54:23,800 --> 02:54:24,610
Well He.
No,

3838
02:54:24,610 --> 02:54:25,610
no,
no shoots.

3839
02:54:25,730 --> 02:54:27,280
There's no shoots.
There's no getting out here.

3840
02:54:27,310 --> 02:54:28,143
Apparently it's,
he knows what he's doing and he can do 

3841
02:54:30,200 --> 02:54:30,460
it.

3842
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:31,293
Who's done it before?
But there's a lot of free solo climber 

3843
02:54:33,160 --> 02:54:36,880
dudes that see the stuff that he does 
and even old school climbers,

3844
02:54:37,090 --> 02:54:38,860
they go.
It's not a matter of if,

3845
02:54:38,890 --> 02:54:40,870
it's when it's a matter of when there 
was this whole,

3846
02:54:40,930 --> 02:54:43,480
um,
television show they did about it,

3847
02:54:43,900 --> 02:54:46,780
where there's these old school climber 
guys were kind of upset with them.

3848
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:49,000
You know,
they're thinking that what he's doing is

3849
02:54:49,210 --> 02:54:51,700
taking far too many risks,
but he doesn't think so.

3850
02:54:51,701 --> 02:54:54,010
He thinks he knows what he's doing and 
he knows how to do it well.

3851
02:54:54,100 --> 02:54:54,933
I would imagine.
I would imagine the route is called 

3852
02:54:56,471 --> 02:54:59,140
Heaven at glacier point.
Glacier point is the mountain.

3853
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:01,480
I would imagine the feeling,
but by the way,

3854
02:55:01,510 --> 02:55:03,040
good job Brian Gallon.
I watched I,

3855
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:04,150
one piece of stone.
I'm like,

3856
02:55:04,190 --> 02:55:06,010
it looks like Al Capp.
I've fucking,

3857
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:06,913
I've climbed 10 times.
We're both wrong about 100 things in a 

3858
02:55:09,171 --> 02:55:11,840
podcast all the time,
but harmful jamie here with the google.

3859
02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:13,840
I'm sure my uranium one will get a,
you know,

3860
02:55:13,850 --> 02:55:17,870
I'm sure they had some picture.
Oh,

3861
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:19,460
come on.
Oh my God.

3862
02:55:19,461 --> 02:55:20,900
Look at that picture.
That's insane.

3863
02:55:20,930 --> 02:55:22,940
On what?
What is that?

3864
02:55:22,941 --> 02:55:25,040
Is that a 45 degree angle?
I don't know,

3865
02:55:25,041 --> 02:55:26,330
Dude.
That's horrifying.

3866
02:55:26,360 --> 02:55:27,193
Is that Jamie?
You would know is that it's close to a 

3867
02:55:28,761 --> 02:55:31,310
45 degree and not get tired.
How does have you ever rock climbed?

3868
02:55:31,810 --> 02:55:33,320
No.
Is the most exhausting thing.

3869
02:55:33,740 --> 02:55:38,740
You your fingers and hands.
I mean you get so pumped so quickly that

3870
02:55:38,841 --> 02:55:39,330
you,
you,

3871
02:55:39,330 --> 02:55:40,163
you just,
you literally can't use your hands and 

3872
02:55:41,241 --> 02:55:42,074
I'm talking to you as very fat fingers.
Like it's really interesting cause he's 

3873
02:55:44,611 --> 02:55:46,580
a very thin guy.
He did the podcast.

3874
02:55:46,960 --> 02:55:47,793
I know when I was talking to him,
his asked him to show me his hands 

3875
02:55:50,421 --> 02:55:51,620
because you have fat fingers.
Yeah.

3876
02:55:51,621 --> 02:55:52,460
He's a friend of mine.

3877
02:55:52,490 --> 02:55:53,800
Got Damn.
It just doesn't have.

3878
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,300
I mean they're not small hands.
What's the way do you think?

3879
02:55:56,510 --> 02:55:57,410
Very light.
Yeah.

3880
02:55:57,430 --> 02:55:58,730
It was probably 1:50
tall.

3881
02:55:58,790 --> 02:56:01,070
If I had to guess,
probably like a five,

3882
02:56:01,071 --> 02:56:02,000
11,
six feet.

3883
02:56:02,150 --> 02:56:05,510
How tall is he fucking done,
dude?

3884
02:56:05,540 --> 02:56:07,530
No,
I just want to know what his body type.

3885
02:56:08,090 --> 02:56:08,923
I think he's a real light and long and 
thin and strong for that kind of stuff 

3886
02:56:12,591 --> 02:56:13,424
because all the time and he just knows 
how to climb and he knows what he's 

3887
02:56:15,801 --> 02:56:18,500
doing and he stays super calm while he 
does it.

3888
02:56:18,501 --> 02:56:19,910
That's one of the things that he 
emphasized.

3889
02:56:19,970 --> 02:56:21,290
This is him at the very top.
See,

3890
02:56:21,291 --> 02:56:23,870
look how every movement is like really 
measured.

3891
02:56:25,250 --> 02:56:26,270
Dude.
He's the master.

3892
02:56:26,390 --> 02:56:29,180
He's a master at that kind of stuff and 
he lives in a van.

3893
02:56:29,600 --> 02:56:31,910
He,
he lives in his van and he drives around

3894
02:56:31,911 --> 02:56:32,960
and just finds places.

3895
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:35,690
Parks and climbs.
He's incredible.

3896
02:56:35,910 --> 02:56:37,040
He's,
he really is.

3897
02:56:37,100 --> 02:56:40,260
It's interesting.
He's like Samurai or something freak,

3898
02:56:40,310 --> 02:56:41,450
that's for sure.
But I mean,

3899
02:56:41,451 --> 02:56:42,284
he's made this name by being this guy 
who does the dangerous scary climbing 

3900
02:56:45,171 --> 02:56:47,810
stuff that nobody wants to do.
When I read that book,

3901
02:56:47,811 --> 02:56:51,860
the Book of five rings by me and month 
Masashi like I got the same sense that,

3902
02:56:51,861 --> 02:56:54,620
that was the experiential,
like his life,

3903
02:56:54,950 --> 02:56:57,740
the margin for error in a,
in a sword fight.

3904
02:56:58,250 --> 02:57:01,520
Uh,
and also he said how you practice has to

3905
02:57:01,521 --> 02:57:06,410
be almost life and death like until 
you're no longer doing it,

3906
02:57:06,411 --> 02:57:06,981
like the,
the,

3907
02:57:06,981 --> 02:57:10,520
the extreme notion of living always on 
the edge.

3908
02:57:11,300 --> 02:57:12,950
Um,
and that,

3909
02:57:12,980 --> 02:57:17,980
that feels like the exact same path,
mindset and probably probably result.

3910
02:57:20,901 --> 02:57:22,300
I don't know if you've got a lot of 
ways,

3911
02:57:22,310 --> 02:57:24,240
God forbid he dies,
but the appearance seems,

3912
02:57:24,250 --> 02:57:29,210
see sort of when that becomes a 
necessity or that becomes,

3913
02:57:29,480 --> 02:57:30,313
I guess how you or what you crave,
this sort of intimate relationship 

3914
02:57:36,981 --> 02:57:37,820
between life and death.

3915
02:57:37,850 --> 02:57:38,661
This sort of like,
you know,

3916
02:57:38,661 --> 02:57:39,710
I think it would,
he craves,

3917
02:57:39,711 --> 02:57:40,544
is doing it like getting some slow.
The flow you get into it knowing that 

3918
02:57:44,031 --> 02:57:44,864
there's a massive risk behind it,
but still being able to execute 

3919
02:57:47,121 --> 02:57:48,980
flawlessly.
That's what he craves,

3920
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:49,833
you know?
And instead of it being a sword coming 

3921
02:57:50,931 --> 02:57:52,760
out of him that he has to check instead 
of that,

3922
02:57:52,761 --> 02:57:53,594
it's him figuring out how to climb a 45 
degree face that's hanging 2000 feet 

3923
02:57:57,831 --> 02:57:59,780
above the ground or whatever the fuck 
that is.

3924
02:58:00,170 --> 02:58:01,890
How many feet do you think that is above
the ground?

3925
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:03,990
When you look down and see those trees 
in the background,

3926
02:58:03,991 --> 02:58:05,840
it looks like more than 2000 feet.
Yeah,

3927
02:58:05,850 --> 02:58:07,890
it does.
How many feet do you think you can climb

3928
02:58:07,891 --> 02:58:09,390
in a day?
You know,

3929
02:58:09,391 --> 02:58:11,760
because a mile is what?
Five thousand feet?

3930
02:58:11,790 --> 02:58:14,700
500 something feet.
Now a mile is 1000,

3931
02:58:14,701 --> 02:58:16,950
300,
434,000,

3932
02:58:16,951 --> 02:58:19,640
280 yards.
Dairies,

3933
02:58:20,260 --> 02:58:21,360
losses.
It's $3,000

3934
02:58:21,370 --> 02:58:23,850
along with yards to fuck 3000 foot 
vertical wall.

3935
02:58:27,810 --> 02:58:30,600
So almost a month.
I got like three quarters of a mile up.

3936
02:58:30,630 --> 02:58:35,250
Three hundred feet above the crown in 
that over overhang with me and 40 feet.

3937
02:58:35,251 --> 02:58:38,580
You're climbing out 40 feet.
