8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,050
I'd be still doing comedy,

9
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:19,884
but it would be different.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:20,970

And uh,

41
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,490
Kevin prayers here and he's
going to stick one up his ass.

42
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:07,830
He says for easier absorption.

43
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,910
[inaudible]

44
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,520
[inaudible]

45
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,560
when I'm an old man on
a mountain somewhere,

46
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,420
my ears are ringing.

47
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,030
I'm going to be like,

48
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,560
fucking Brian got in there,

49
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,550
he got me.

50
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,383
Fuck,

51
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,380
he wore it all out,

52
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,400
beat my eardrums and this a few guys
that come over the house and we have to

53
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:33,150
just keep saying,

54
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,571
don't talk.

55
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:33,991
Don't talk.

56
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:34,171
Okay?

57
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:36,510
Nobody talked nobody to
talk because you know,

58
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,420
once Kevin gets over here,

59
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,660
the moment he arrived,

60
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:39,821
I,

61
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:40,070
I

62
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,670
met him in my driveway and immediately
we start talking about how Siri is

63
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:44,690
fucking sky net.

64
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:45,291
And I mean,

65
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,370
it's like right out of the gate.

66
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:46,611
I'm like,

67
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:47,444
shit man,

68
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:47,820
we,

69
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,730
we haven't even got into it yet.

70
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,720
You haven't even started talking.

71
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,710
I offered you,

72
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,940
I gave you the opportunity
to wipe your workout,

73
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:55,340
stink all over myself.

74
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:57,260
And Joe actually went for it.

75
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:58,300
It was pretty fucking girls.

76
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,390
He's sweating,

77
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,490
put me in a cinder block in
his driveway and was like,

78
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:01,790
dude,

79
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,810
absorb my essence.

80
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:03,830
I'm used to Jujitsu,

81
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,111
man.

82
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:05,790
I'm used to do sweating on me.

83
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,923
But uh,

84
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,620
I came out all sweaty cause
I was hitting the bag and uh,

85
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,071
I was like,

86
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:11,731
I'll give you a hug.

87
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,331
But he goes,

88
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:12,481
Nah,

89
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:13,140
come on man.

90
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,381
I'll go.

91
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:14,214
All right.

92
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,183
He panicked.

93
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,510
Oh,

94
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,440
I ran,

95
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,313
I ran for the no one,

96
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,560
none of this first.

97
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,380
The first time I moved out here,

98
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:21,760
the first time I went
everyday to Joe's house,

99
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:25,030
he was working out with his friend
Eddie and he answered the door.

100
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:27,170
And this is when he was like insane boys.

101
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:27,520
Still,

102
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,420
you're probably more now,

103
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:33,160
but you were insanely ripped and Eddie
and you both came into our sweaty as hell

104
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:37,060
and did the same thing and gave the man
hug and totally different weight lifting

105
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:37,690
days,

106
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,220
more bodybuilding muscle back then,

107
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:40,060
but it wasn't as strong.

108
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:40,531
It's weird.

109
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:43,090
So your description sounded like a
little bit of slash fiction there for a

110
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:43,630
second.

111
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,110
Slash.

112
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,943
Fiction.

113
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,030
He writes the story.

114
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:46,421
Oh yeah.

115
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:49,240
Joe came out of the garage and
son was glistening off his hips.

116
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,350
His nipples were
protruding out of his ass.

117
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,490
Ain't no sense in this
lab called slash fiction.

118
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:54,671
Yeah.

119
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:55,900
That's a whole like subset of fiction.

120
00:02:55,901 --> 00:03:00,760
People who write like sexual fiction
about like star trek really kicked it off.

121
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:01,410
There's one that,

122
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:01,830
yeah,

123
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,320
Betty.

124
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,153
Right.

125
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,030
So what you're saying is that there's a
whole genre of like fiction pornography

126
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:12,730
about famous people or
like it's fantasy towards,

127
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,010
there's probably care bear
slash fiction out there.

128
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:15,280
Yeah.

129
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,551
Oh,

130
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,240
I'm sure there is.

131
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,350
I probably wrote some of it.

132
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,450
Cow fucking weird.

133
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:20,081
Are People,

134
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:20,914
man,

135
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,950
that they have like sexuality
intertwined into their hobbies and their,

136
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:26,771
their,

137
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:27,101
you know,

138
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:27,580
their,

139
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,570
their fetishes and they're,

140
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:29,800
they're weird TV shows.

141
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,950
They're into this podcast
brought to you by fleshlight.

142
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,370
How is it to have sexuality
intertwined into everything?

143
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:36,640
Yeah,

144
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,440
but that's just something
to jerk often too.

145
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,711
I mean,

146
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:43,210
everybody George's off and
all the fleshlight is a
technological improvement on

147
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:43,811
jerking off.

148
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:46,500
So what if I need slash fiction about
like what if I needed a good story about

149
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,850
Bronnie Tower Guy fucking
the jolly green giant.

150
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,290
What does he do that to get off,

151
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,120
but there's people that
are into that kind of shit.

152
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:52,381
Right.

153
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:53,214
That's like,

154
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,340
now that you brought this up,

155
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,090
I can be pretty hot.

156
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,910
I remember somebody else
having a conversation with
me about this and they were

157
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,130
talking about the house.

158
00:03:59,440 --> 00:03:59,711
They,

159
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:02,890
there's a website where people are
into different cartoon characters.

160
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,880
Firstborn I ever bought was a
playboy Jessica rabbit issue.

161
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,670
Wait a minute now that I'm realizing
now I'm thinking back again now.

162
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,151
It was like,

163
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,840
there was like all this porn that used
to be online where it was like the

164
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:15,160
Flintstones fucking

165
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,370
hardcore hardcore and it was weird
because it was kind of like hot.

166
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,710
You know Fred was fucking
banging in Barney roles wife.

167
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,610
What was her name?

168
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,863
Was it Betty?

169
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,880
Betty Roberts read was
banging and Betty Roberts,

170
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:31,870
he max and Ruby Joe.

171
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,871
It's awesome on their Max and Ruby
to have sex or whatever that Dora the

172
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:37,774
explorer.

173
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,650
Really?

174
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,580
I saw a Simpson's takeover ad once it
popped up and it was like Maggie had a

175
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:43,150
penis,

176
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,590
the baby had a penis,

177
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:48,100
the female baby and was like fucking
margins mouth with it and I was like,

178
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,000
hold on.

179
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,160
They're all hot singles in my
area that want to chat with me.

180
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:53,680
I got to attend to them for
anything ever shot any anymore?

181
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:54,600
Like anything at all?

182
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,340
No,

183
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,800
just videos or nothing.

184
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,420
I'm pretty desensitized.

185
00:04:58,421 --> 00:04:58,600
Me.

186
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,730
Didn't you just say before

187
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,721
there is,

188
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:03,070
there is one like you got to understand,

189
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:03,490
I've been,

190
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,600
I've seen like soldiers get heads cut
off at like eight or nine years old when

191
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:11,910
you were on boards style
project back in the day before.

192
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,381
It's not.

193
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:15,550
My style was like the
first is how I know you.

194
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,071
Yeah,

195
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:17,530
I talked to that guy on line still.

196
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,660
He sent me a Facebook message back one.

197
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:19,880
Yes.

198
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,930
Supposedly I might not
read the real style rhinos.

199
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,760
I talked to him one that
was more of a movement.

200
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,653
He's not a person.

201
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,520
He's anonymous now.

202
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,110
I've talked to him on the phone once.

203
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:29,561
Uh,

204
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:30,090
we were uh,

205
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,923
they um,

206
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,660
a radio show.

207
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,251
So it was like on the,

208
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:32,770
I was on the phone,

209
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,220
he was on the radio show was like,

210
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,380
it was like an Internet radio show.

211
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:36,214
He's a good guy.

212
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,620
Yeah,

213
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,660
he's just a kid.

214
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:38,080
You know.

215
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,351
I don't,

216
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:38,831
I don't know him.

217
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,090
Well I don't know his thing.

218
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,430
But boy did he have crazy fucked up site.

219
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,460
You should get them on on a show
or you should get him on his show.

220
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:48,610
That's something that's never been
done on like no one's ever really seen.

221
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah,

222
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,890
I wouldn't have to know who.

223
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,340
There was a real style though.

224
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:55,180
How the hell would you know kiss guy who
has a blog like that you probably know

225
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:55,920
pretty quick.

226
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,160
Thanks.

227
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,340
So there's a lot of guys that would be
fake styles and I think would look good.

228
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,740
So chat with it.

229
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:05,060
Is that what the Chit Chat with
the guy who's trolling as style?

230
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,860
One of the guys that really the first
guy to promote my website though on the

231
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:10,590
Internet.

232
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,360
Yeah.

233
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,050
He made a blog post about my comedy
being really funny and my website being

234
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:15,884
really cool and,

235
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,620
and then also these people started coming
over to my message board and then it

236
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:21,320
started taking off and it's one of
the reasons why at the beginning of my

237
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:23,120
website was so sick to have sure.

238
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,010
My message board has always been
so twisted that it was style.

239
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,890
The style infection from the beginning.

240
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,690
Have you been a rotten dotcom recently?

241
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,760
They need to hire a web designer is the
exact same website as it was since the

242
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,750
beginning of the Internet.

243
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,540
I don't think they need,

244
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,440
you want the web 2.0 version of
dudes shitting in people's mouths.

245
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,783
That's what you want.

246
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,140
That car accident.

247
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:42,531
Just rotten.

248
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:47,330
Really need its own app for what exactly
is web 2.0 it's got to have rounded

249
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:49,840
corners and glossy buttons
and reflection shadows.

250
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,540
What is it?

251
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,271
It's like it's,

252
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:55,070
it was a concept for a set of standards
for how the web should work at the time.

253
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:55,521
So it's like,

254
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:56,120
you know,

255
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,970
web 2.0 uh,

256
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,370
you know,

257
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,031
things should be,

258
00:06:59,031 --> 00:06:59,370
you know,

259
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,720
cloudbase stored in the server.

260
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,450
There should be endless scrolls on pages.

261
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:04,520
There's all these things that
happened with iterations of the web.

262
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:05,060
You know,

263
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,830
I just saw it on the first time I saw it
was years ago on some guy's website who

264
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:10,790
makes websites,

265
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,290
websites.

266
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,180
We're kind of whack and you know,

267
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:17,540
I had this thing about web 2.0 like it
was like using all the right terms and

268
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:17,811
everything,

269
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:18,321
but as it was,

270
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,310
work was wack.

271
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,890
Synergize the web management
system fuel the future.

272
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,091
Yeah.

273
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:24,681
It's a weird thing,

274
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:24,861
right?

275
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,870
When anything ever
anything becomes popular.

276
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,381
You know,

277
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:27,591
there's,

278
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:31,910
there's people who are like real for real
geeks and then there's people who see

279
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,710
Geekdom as an opportunity to sort of
make some money and they pretend to be

280
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:37,544
geeks.

281
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,710
I've never experienced that in my life.

282
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,210
You've never experienced fake Geeks,

283
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,410
really?

284
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,760
What are you smiling like that for?

285
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,340
I'm just saying is that it's
a pleasure and not explain.

286
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,203
I see it every day.

287
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,830
Every fucking day.

288
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,221
You're kidding.

289
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:49,660
Right?

290
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,900
Every day you see fake geeks.

291
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,360
Is it annoying to you being a real geek?

292
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,820
You know,

293
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,141
somewhat.

294
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,730
Someone out there thinks I'm as
fake as like as they come as well.

295
00:07:56,731 --> 00:07:57,890
So it's all relative.

296
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:58,820
I'm a geek as well.

297
00:07:58,821 --> 00:07:59,421
And when I say this,

298
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:00,254
I'm not saying like,

299
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,580
you know,

300
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,390
like I'm a mean person calls on a geek,

301
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,021
you know,

302
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:03,854
and I'm,

303
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,693
I'm uh,

304
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,140
an undereducated Geek.

305
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,280
I wouldn't say I'm a fakey can,

306
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,630
I just don't know how anything works.

307
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,281
You put into it all,

308
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,114
but I don't know how it works.

309
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,980
You put.net instead of.tv by the way,

310
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,501
on your link.

311
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:14,780
So everyone was freaking out on Twitter.

312
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,390
Really?

313
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,480
Oh yeah.

314
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,323
Sorry.

315
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:17,911
Here,

316
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:18,660
I'll retweet that.

317
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,320
Should we live?

318
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,640
Is this live?

319
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,810
Is there,

320
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,650
what was the video?

321
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:26,160
Did you ever say what
the video was that you,

322
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,140
we want to get into that?

323
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,550
It's just too gross.

324
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:28,760
It's,

325
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:28,971
I mean,

326
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:29,630
it's dark.

327
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,500
It was fucking dark.

328
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:30,681
I mean,

329
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,011
I don't know.

330
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,210
For whatever reason it rocked me.

331
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:32,600
It was,

332
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,600
there was a reddit post on people that
are making knock off ugg boots and China

333
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,330
and they said that there's these entire
factories where they're just cutting up

334
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:42,530
dogs while they're alive.

335
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,560
Just skinning dogs alive and taking that
for processing it up and serving out

336
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:49,131
there as an Ugg boot.

337
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:49,491
And I'm like,

338
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:49,870
Dude,

339
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,180
you know what?

340
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,540
I don't,

341
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,250
I used to click on this
stuff and I used to,

342
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,173
I can't do that.

343
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,280
He used to pride myself on separating the,

344
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:56,040
these are just pixels

345
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,491
on a screen.

346
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:57,420
These are ones and Zeros.

347
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,020
This isn't real.

348
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,860
There's no emotion here.

349
00:08:58,861 --> 00:08:59,694
There's now an,

350
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,350
I was so desensitized from those,

351
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,820
those early days and I was like,

352
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,421
fuck it.

353
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,021
Let's see this video.

354
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,190
Let's see what this world really is.

355
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,780
And it just shattered me.

356
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:08,400
It ruined my whole fucking day.

357
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:09,091
It's ruined my week.

358
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,530
It's still like in my head,

359
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:11,900
which you know what,

360
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,890
like good cause at least
now I'm talking about it.

361
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:14,521
It was a graphic,

362
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:14,971
terrible thing,

363
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,170
but I didn't know they do that.

364
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:20,100
I know they skin fucking dogs
alive to make knock off ugg boots

365
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,240
video.

366
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,230
It's very hard to watch.

367
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:22,501
It's hard,

368
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:22,710
right?

369
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,020
It's really hard to watch
any of those skinning videos.

370
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:28,680
Those are horrific because they show
the bodies and they're still alive.

371
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:29,810
They don't even bother killing him.

372
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,220
No,

373
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,053
they just,

374
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,520
they don't kill him first.

375
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:35,730
They skin them while they're
still breathing and they
feel everything and it's

376
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,131
there.

377
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:37,020
So insensitive.

378
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:37,231
They don't,

379
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:38,011
it doesn't bother them.

380
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,000
Even the slightest.

381
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,060
There's like levels of humanity
and people dipped down to,

382
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,350
that's very disturbing.

383
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,850
Like I'm sure you've seen the,

384
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,870
the dolphin decks in Japan where
they have dolphins laid on a deck,

385
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:50,100
50 60 dolphins,

386
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,780
and they just slice their throats.

387
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,020
They pull them out of the water and
they sliced their throats and it is

388
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,730
horrific.

389
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,481
How else should the,

390
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:57,080
I'm sorry,

391
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,040
I had to play devil's advocate.

392
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,170
How else are they supposed to
do their scientific research?

393
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:00,770
Oh,

394
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,603
I got it.

395
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,920
She fucking,

396
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,790
it's fucking terrible,

397
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,161
man.

398
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:07,090
He can't shoot him in the head.

399
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:07,924
If you're going to kill him,

400
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,100
you can't shoot him in the head.

401
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,701
You've got to do it.

402
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:09,941
That one.

403
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:11,050
I'm not saying you should kill him.

404
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:11,291
You know,

405
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,980
I'm not a first for killing them,

406
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:14,680
but how horrific is it that they do,

407
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,690
the way they choose to do
it is to bleed them out.

408
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,990
But you're asking for like an ounce of
humanity and some of the most inhumane

409
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:20,824
acts,

410
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,073
and that's like,

411
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,630
that's okay to ask for
what's okay to ask for.

412
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,990
It's,

413
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,340
it's really disturbing.

414
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:26,611
Right?

415
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:30,600
But what is it that allows
some folks to go to a place?

416
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:31,710
Is it necessity?

417
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,161
I mean,

418
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:37,161
what the fuck is it that allows people
to not give even one shit about a dolphin

419
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,570
or a dog they make boots out of,

420
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:40,170
or anybody,

421
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,460
because they don't see
the dolphin or the dog.

422
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:43,470
They see their survival and
their family's survival.

423
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,370
That's all they see.

424
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,203
It's a necessity.

425
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,351
It's a gotta be in it.

426
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:47,184
So it must be right.

427
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,461
I mean,

428
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:52,440
if you had a choice of doing a podcast
every day or slitting dolphins throats,

429
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,700
you would do a podcast every day.

430
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,960
This person doesn't have that choice,

431
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,450
or they at least they don't
feel like they have that choice.

432
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,280
I would imagine if they had that,

433
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,360
if some dudes out there was like,

434
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:00,811
oh dude,

435
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:00,991
sweet,

436
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,381
I get to,

437
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:03,000
I get to skin a fucking gray hound today.

438
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,760
Can't wait and I'm going to punch some
rabbits in the face before I get home.

439
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,890
If someone's really thinking that I don't,

440
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:08,460
I can't,

441
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,470
I don't want to wrap my head around.

442
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,323
Of course they are.

443
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,100
There's people,

444
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,370
there's,

445
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,360
there's dark people,

446
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,051
no doubt about it.

447
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:14,100
I know that there are people that do that,

448
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:17,250
but I mean systematically for hundreds
of thousands of workers to do that.

449
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,800
I don't want to believe
that that's there at it.

450
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,430
I've watched videos of people beating
cows when they work with in the

451
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,180
slaughterhouse and they're
hitting cows with hammers.

452
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,750
Well that just makes them tastier.

453
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,091
That's pure.

454
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:29,230
That's pre tenderization.

455
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:33,390
Just I went to the city pound today
and have you ever been to a city pound?

456
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,170
Like I killed her own dogs from pounds?

457
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,550
Yeah,

458
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:35,990
the dog.

459
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,611
Squeaky member.

460
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:36,970
Squeaky.

461
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,803
Yeah.

462
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,170
I don't understand how any of
these dogs ever get taken there.

463
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:44,260
Like all the dogs their
day all look fucking dirty,

464
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,070
beat up,

465
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,030
just nasty.

466
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:46,271
Every,

467
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:47,470
all of them were barking.

468
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,940
It was like the most saddest,

469
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,860
depressing and thing ever.

470
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,170
And then I watched
somebody give up their dog,

471
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:53,771
this,

472
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:53,980
this

473
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,920
girl about 24 came in
with a pit and she goes,

474
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:58,160
I need to surrender this dog.

475
00:11:58,161 --> 00:11:58,511
And they're like,

476
00:11:58,511 --> 00:11:59,500
it's $25.

477
00:11:59,501 --> 00:11:59,861
And she goes,

478
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:00,181
all right.

479
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:02,680
And she gives him a $25
and then she gives the,

480
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,370
uh,

481
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,570
the leash to the woman and the dog
didn't want to leave the girls side.

482
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,180
And so she,

483
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,630
the woman had to like pull
and drag the dog through.

484
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:13,000
And then the woman just
seemed unfazed by it though.

485
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:13,700
And I'm just like,

486
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,321
which woman?

487
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:14,800
The woman woman.

488
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,960
It was giving up the
dog and I'm just like,

489
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:17,794
how do you,

490
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,760
like if I have a dog that needed to get
rid of and even for whatever reason,

491
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,200
it's never going to be that.

492
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,430
I don't think it's going to be,

493
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,720
find a friend first,

494
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:27,070
find something first.

495
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,850
And,

496
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,550
but she probably,

497
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,090
the dog was probably nuts
or hopefully that issue.

498
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,580
It's not that she didn't have the
space for it at the time for it.

499
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,000
Right.

500
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,040
Because when people do that and
they bring a dog to the pound,

501
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,110
I mean you're just asking
someone else to kill the thing.

502
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,170
You're just asking you
just like take it out,

503
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,110
take it out of my hand,

504
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,041
tell you that in my head.

505
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,060
I don't want it in my head anymore.

506
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,500
Here you put it in your head now,

507
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,423
now you deal with it.

508
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,091
What's crazy?

509
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:52,360
Some people are like that and I think
some people are just really irresponsible

510
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:53,640
and inconsiderate and they don't know.

511
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,040
You know?

512
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,281
It's like,

513
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:54,571
well,

514
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:55,870
I'll get this thing for
two minutes and then,

515
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,171
okay,

516
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:57,010
I'm done with this play thing.

517
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,130
I was really something I love.

518
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,020
That's very surprised though,

519
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:03,310
that they didn't clean up the dogs
because my friend works at the shelter and

520
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,270
the place they did.

521
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,830
They take dogs that are about to do,

522
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:06,341
to die,

523
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:07,330
like to be put to sleep,

524
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:08,620
and they rescued those dogs.

525
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,660
Then they cleaned them
up and repackage them,

526
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:11,021
you know,

527
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:11,531
and then like,

528
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:11,711
you know,

529
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:13,030
refurbish them or whatever,

530
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:13,391
and then,

531
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:14,141
and then they,

532
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:14,974
these dogs,

533
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,880
amazing looking.

534
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:16,421
You walk in,

535
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,210
you want every single dog and
these are all dog's about to die.

536
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,230
It's like you would think
this like city pound,

537
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,280
little city pound would hire four kids,

538
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,640
you know,

539
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,440
in high school to clean up these dogs.

540
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,303
There's no money,

541
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,260
there's no money for anything
that was poor people.

542
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,040
Anybody.

543
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,491
I mean that's a,

544
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:32,070
that's a dark road when you,

545
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,010
especially today when you deal with all
the fucking economic hardships that are

546
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:39,280
hitting people and then you
ask people to care about dog.

547
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:40,330
So good luck.

548
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,560
They had roosters there though.

549
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:42,340
Snakes.

550
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,660
They had bunnies.

551
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,690
They had tons of bunnies and
chickens and like fucking years.

552
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,833
It was crazy.

553
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,730
It's like the new thing that's like the
new thing to have I think as a rooster.

554
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,210
Yeah,

555
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,020
no joke.

556
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,740
Well also there's,

557
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,170
there's a lot of super logical,

558
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,840
I mean that was like a hipster thing
from an a serious dead serious.

559
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,490
My microphone down.

560
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,300
Don't send me here please.

561
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:02,690
Yeah,

562
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,410
it's really loud,

563
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,243
man.

564
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,710
Um,

565
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,371
I went to,

566
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:06,820
uh,

567
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,653
my uh,

568
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,770
old gardener and he used to fight
roosters and then went to actually a cock

569
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:11,981
fight.

570
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:14,830
Them like strap razor blades on
their feet out of the whole deal.

571
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,333
A little louder.

572
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,213
A little louder.

573
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:17,980
That's good.

574
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,550
Good.

575
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:18,851
Yeah,

576
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:19,211
he,

577
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:19,960
um,

578
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,610
he used to raise him and fight him,

579
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:22,923
you know,

580
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,400
took me to like where his friend has
like this whole setup where they have

581
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:31,000
hundreds of these different
roosters in these cages and shit.

582
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,770
What's the setup was just like underground
or is it like he had a lot of space?

583
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,850
It's really weird man,

584
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,940
because it's not that far from here,

585
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:40,360
you know?

586
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:40,771
I mean,

587
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:44,380
you drive maybe 20 minutes
and you're in Mexico Bro.

588
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:44,980
I mean,

589
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,080
I mean you're really in Mexico.

590
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:46,811
I thought you like saw this.

591
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,430
Here it is here.

592
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,600
It's close.

593
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,070
I'm saying it's in Mexico.

594
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,400
Everything's in Spanish.

595
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,900
The entire neighborhood is,

596
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,360
they've just completely,

597
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,780
uh,

598
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,430
turned this one neighborhood.

599
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,743
I don't want to say where it is,

600
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,260
uh,

601
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,861
into,

602
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:01,310
uh,

603
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,680
into essentially like a branch of Mexico.

604
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,340
It's nuts.

605
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,300
Everything is in Spanish.

606
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:07,010
Every sign and every store was in Spanish.

607
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:07,730
Really?

608
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:07,881
Yeah.

609
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:08,714
It was amazing.

610
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,021
I was like,

611
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:11,100
this is Kinda cool that
they've been able to do that.

612
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:11,961
It's kind of weird.

613
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:12,171
I'm like,

614
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:12,561
come on man,

615
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:13,200
you're in America.

616
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,240
Just learn to fucking language.

617
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:14,990
It's not that hard.

618
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,231
You know,

619
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:16,370
if I know it all right.

620
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:17,050
And you know,

621
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,290
I know a lot of idiots that no,

622
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,150
no English,

623
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:19,551
you could do it,

624
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,650
just get a damn Rosetta
stone figure shit out.

625
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,120
But you know to them,

626
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:23,391
I guess,

627
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,541
you know,

628
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,880
they want to be around their people and
there's nothing wrong with that man.

629
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,400
You know this guy was cool
as fuck this gardener but uh,

630
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,060
did he show you?

631
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,950
Did you actually go watch them?

632
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,141
No,

633
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:31,730
I didn't watch the actual fight itself,

634
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,800
but I went and watched them fuck around.

635
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,360
I want to watch them
train with each other.

636
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:36,740
They train them know and they're like,

637
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,710
they have them go at each other with no
spurs on and they decide when to pull

638
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:40,670
them off and you know,

639
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:41,060
they,

640
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,010
they do a bunch of shit to them to like,

641
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,910
they feed them like certain certain
food to make sure that they're strong,

642
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,450
you know,

643
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,010
high protein and yeah,

644
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:53,450
they have a championship lines of roosters
and you want to buy a roosters and

645
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,370
breed them with like
championship blood lines.

646
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,820
Cause you want like a really aggressive
bad ass register that really knows how

647
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:03,110
to get abs fantasy league for
cockfighting that needs to be built,

648
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:04,100
that needs to be put together,

649
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,570
gambling a lot of gambling,

650
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,193
Farmville,

651
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,001
bring it in,

652
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:08,810
bring it into Vegas.

653
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,340
You've gotta be there as well.

654
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:12,470
I think it's legit in a couple of states.

655
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,310
I think it's legal in a couple of states.

656
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,520
So nothing was illegal everywhere really.

657
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,350
I would,

658
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,550
I would imagine something like that.

659
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,170
To me it's like,

660
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,510
it's like dog fighting.

661
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,100
How would that,

662
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,933
you know,

663
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:23,940
no,

664
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,320
no,

665
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,560
no,

666
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:24,691
no,

667
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:24,791
no,

668
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:24,891
no.

669
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:26,030
It's not like dog fighting.

670
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:26,841
Dogs are awesome.

671
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:28,070
Chickens can suck my dick.

672
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:28,910
All right.

673
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,080
I never care about chickens.

674
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,850
They're staring at home though,

675
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,103
is roost.

676
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,560
That feels the same way about his,

677
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,220
about dogs get cold hearted dinosaurs.

678
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,271
Okay.

679
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:42,890
Cockfighting is now legal in all
50 states and in Washington DC,

680
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,390
the last state to make it.

681
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,080
Yeah.

682
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,321
Yeah.

683
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:46,154
It's interesting.

684
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,313
Wow.

685
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,850
I think it was a,

686
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:51,260
it was legal pretty recently though.

687
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,870
Not Illegal in West Hollywood.

688
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,440
Shut up Brian trying to be gay and funny.

689
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:58,250
Silly goose.

690
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:58,551
He,

691
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,270
uh,

692
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,500
he is apparently.

693
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:01,941
What was the,

694
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:02,051
uh,

695
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:03,500
the gay Jim Carrey thing
that you're watching,

696
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,593
he's talked about.

697
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,560
Did you ever watch that?

698
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,981
No,

699
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:07,371
I didn't know.

700
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:09,800
But he said the reason he watched
it was that while it was on,

701
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:12,050
but the remote was so far
away that I was just like,

702
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,913
ah.

703
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,361
I'm like,

704
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:13,790
that's,

705
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,290
that's your excuse for watching gay porn.

706
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,400
Like you don't want
her to watch two dudes.

707
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:16,750
Fuck.

708
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:16,970
Well,

709
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,803
it doesn't start off like,

710
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,351
I'm sorry.

711
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:19,184
Here's the information.

712
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,920
Louisiana was the last
state and it was 2007,

713
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:22,401
so that's pretty,

714
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:22,791
God damn.

715
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,790
Recently Ben took effect in 2008.

716
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,070
Someone's still fighting to repeal that.

717
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:28,221
They're,

718
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:28,551
you know,

719
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:29,384
it,

720
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,801
it's fascinating.

721
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:31,634
It's like rappers.

722
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,583
Yeah.

723
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,080
Well,

724
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,920
well I know that,

725
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:34,480
um,

726
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:34,790
uh,

727
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,180
Roy Jones Jr is a huge
proponent of the cock fighting.

728
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:38,660
You know,

729
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,210
he used to fly in private
jets with roosters.

730
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,620
He was flying,

731
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,450
he was the fucking middle
weight champion of the world,

732
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:44,840
you know,

733
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,970
flying around and Goddamn private jet
and he would bring like 10 roosters with

734
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:48,890
them and cages.

735
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,650
Wow.

736
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:49,801
Yeah,

737
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:50,760
he was nuts man.

738
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,050
And he would fight them himself.

739
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:52,850
Yeah,

740
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,250
yeah,

741
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:53,710
yeah.

742
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,400
Wow.

743
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,040
It's no backlash for that for him or no?

744
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:56,730
Well,

745
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,830
it's not the same man.

746
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,051
You know,

747
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:59,640
like the backlash from Michael Vick.

748
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,361
Look,

749
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:00,621
there's,

750
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,680
there's a big difference.

751
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:01,861
You,

752
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:02,730
you tell someone,

753
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,260
someone fights dogs and you go,

754
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:04,801
whoa man,

755
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:05,634
that's kind of fucked up.

756
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:05,981
You know,

757
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:06,240
like,

758
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,620
and,

759
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,251
and then you,

760
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:10,350
you heard the other shit that Vic did
where he would electrocute the dogs,

761
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,600
drown them or shoot him in the
head like he murdered them.

762
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,830
He murdered a bunch of dogs.

763
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:16,260
And that takes a certain
personality that we don't like.

764
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,620
We were just talking to
exactly when it even worse,

765
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:21,120
because this is a multimillionaire.

766
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:23,550
This isn't a guy who's in
any state of necessity.

767
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,810
It's this isn't cruelty because he's in
a bad position and it needs to do this

768
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:29,100
because he's got to put food on the table.

769
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,890
Now this is a guy who's getting
off on killing animals for sure,

770
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,940
and we just kind of accepted him back
into the fold because he's really good at

771
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:36,690
football,

772
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:36,931
you know?

773
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:37,681
And I know people say,

774
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:38,011
well,

775
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,371
you know,

776
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:38,730
he's a,

777
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,451
he did his time.

778
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:39,691
Yeah,

779
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:40,740
I guess he did do his time,

780
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:41,460
but there's,

781
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,460
there's a certain amount of what he did
that's so horrific that it just makes

782
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:51,030
you really hesitant to ever forgive
someone for that kind of behavior.

783
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:51,361
You know,

784
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:52,800
I forgive someone for fucking up.

785
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,290
I forgive someone for saying things.

786
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,650
I forgave someone for racism.

787
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:56,250
I forgive,

788
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,050
I forgive someone for poor mental choices,

789
00:18:58,051 --> 00:18:59,550
but when you kill a hundred dogs,

790
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:00,000
man,

791
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,120
and you electrocute them and shoot them
and stabbed them and doing all that shit

792
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:04,590
that he supposedly did.

793
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,010
Right.

794
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,850
I don't like you.

795
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,290
I don't think I'll ever like you.

796
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,580
I don't think I can like you.

797
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,090
I think you,

798
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:09,550
you,

799
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,840
you're capable of doing some
shit that I would never imagine.

800
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,210
And how far back have
you bounce from that?

801
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,230
180 degrees.

802
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,550
Are you a perfect person now?

803
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,070
Oh,

804
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,450
you just less creepy because you know
the cameras are on you and you don't want

805
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,910
to go back to jail for killing dogs.

806
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,080
Fuck you man.

807
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,050
Do you think there's an expectation though
that people have an expectation like,

808
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:28,261
well,

809
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:28,471
okay,

810
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:29,930
he did his time so you should have any,

811
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,810
I guess you should.

812
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:31,390
Yeah,

813
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,223
expectation.

814
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,480
I would like to believe,

815
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:35,130
I would like to believe that people can,

816
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,760
you know,

817
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,710
fully learned from.

818
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,651
But man,

819
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:41,560
I liked dogs and that drove me crazy
and I like pit bulls and you know what?

820
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,960
Pimples like to fight,

821
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:43,231
man,

822
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,130
that is a fact.

823
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,070
They like it.

824
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,511
I've,

825
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:49,740
I've had to break my dogs up many times
when I have pit bulls and it's scary,

826
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,500
especially they don't want to let
go and they're wagging their tails.

827
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,350
They're both wagging their tails and
their locked onto each other's faces.

828
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:55,930
You know,

829
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,700
it's crazy.

830
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,241
It's crazy.

831
00:19:57,241 --> 00:19:58,110
But that's what they do,

832
00:19:58,111 --> 00:19:58,471
man.

833
00:19:58,471 --> 00:19:58,711
It's,

834
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,640
it's there thousands of years of,

835
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:01,830
of genetic breeding.

836
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:02,191
And you know,

837
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:06,630
what is this coming from a person who's
deeply involved in human fighting.

838
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,980
So for me,

839
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,630
like dog fighting is a,

840
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,170
what does it less brutal than when I
fucking watch every weekend cause it less

841
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,400
brutal than you know,

842
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:17,310
then Alistair Overeem kicking you
in the fucking head with his shin.

843
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,350
I think a dog bite,

844
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,250
and you might be a little
less brutal than that.

845
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:20,791
You know,

846
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:24,030
it might be less brutal than having Cain
Velasquez Punch a fucking hole through

847
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:24,720
your face.

848
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,070
Like he did the Brock Lesnar.

849
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,670
You know what I mean?

850
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,830
Shit guys,

851
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,723
guys or those guys.

852
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,030
Cause they want to be there.

853
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:31,400
They're making a conscious
decision to be there.

854
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:31,831
Guess what?

855
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:32,850
The dogs want to do it too.

856
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,150
They want to bike through the fucking
cops are killing each other and there's no

857
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:36,750
referee.

858
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,583
Really scary.

859
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,830
Well yes there are.

860
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:38,950
No,

861
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,600
that's not true.

862
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:39,770
No,

863
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:39,850
no,

864
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:39,931
no,

865
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:40,080
no.

866
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,590
That's not true.

867
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,350
That's not true.

868
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,851
The dogs.

869
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:44,100
They break the dogs and then they bring
them back together again at the dog.

870
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:44,581
Shies away.

871
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:45,414
They stop it.

872
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,470
That's incorrect.

873
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,310
He like the electrocution and the drought.

874
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,880
We've got dogs that are not game.

875
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:52,811
This is,

876
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:53,644
um,

877
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,000
the,

878
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,060
the idea is you never breed a
dog that is human aggressive.

879
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,460
He never breed a dog that quits.

880
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,310
You never beat a dog that
is scared of another dog,

881
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,620
a dog that backs away the,

882
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,410
the thing what they've done with pit
bulls is they've taken this animal and

883
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:13,411
they've engineered it into a super fighter
and there's no other dog that comes

884
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,340
close to a pit bull when
it comes to dog fighting.

885
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,240
There's no other dog.

886
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,313
And this isn't,

887
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:17,771
you know,

888
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:18,101
I'm not,

889
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:19,660
I'm not bragging about this.

890
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:21,430
This isn't like fanboy talk.

891
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:21,821
This is,

892
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:23,200
this is just what they've done.

893
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:24,370
They've taken this animal,

894
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:26,260
they made it something very unusual.

895
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,260
What they've done is they made an animal
that's absolutely unafraid to die.

896
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,610
Absolutely unafraid of pain,

897
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,150
absolutely unafraid of
conflict and impact.

898
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,250
They go right after the dogs.

899
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,360
There's no hesitation.

900
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,081
A lot of dogs,

901
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:38,711
they growl.

902
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:40,450
They try to figure out
who's going to be the boss,

903
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,400
the piss and offense Miami and be
able to avoid a fight all together.

904
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,670
There's no avoiding a fight with pit bull.

905
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,330
None.

906
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:46,960
Zero.

907
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,860
If there's a wild,

908
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,270
if it's a pit bull and he's out of his
cage and he's a male and he has his balls

909
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,140
and there's another dog that's a male
and has his balls and that dog does

910
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,710
anything even remotely resembling
something that challenges the pitbulls

911
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,570
dominance,

912
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,200
there's a fight.

913
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,033
He's been bred for that.

914
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:03,741
Unless you're,

915
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,340
you're just a bad motherfucker,

916
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:09,190
Cesar Milan guy and you've done a really
good job of breeding your dog or you've

917
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:14,080
got a specific particular docile
version of the breed where many,

918
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:14,261
many,

919
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:18,340
many generations of of breeders
have bred the gameness out of pits.

920
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,230
When I'm talking about game pit bulls,

921
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,311
most people,

922
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:22,810
what you see when you see a pit bull,

923
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:24,880
you see it as like 90 pound muscular,

924
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:25,690
big headed.

925
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,420
That's not a game pit bull again,

926
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,380
pit bulls about 35 pounds,

927
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,460
they're very small and they look
like like almost like a beagle man.

928
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:34,420
I mean I don't want to,

929
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,350
not really,

930
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:39,460
but they don't look like the
dogs that we are used to seeing.

931
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,200
They look like these,

932
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:45,990
these little sinewy little
like springy athletic dogs.

933
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,380
And the idea was you had to get a
small dog because you had to be able to

934
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:52,300
physically separate them
when they're going at it.

935
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,880
If you got to 90 pound pit bulls going at,

936
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:57,280
first of all they don't last
the gas out really quick,

937
00:22:57,281 --> 00:23:01,240
just like heavyweight fighters and
the gas out really quick and they,

938
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,380
you can't separate them.

939
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,490
They're too fucking strong.

940
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,930
It's too dangerous to to 35 pounds.

941
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:07,270
She just get right in
there and pick them up.

942
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,740
25 pound or 28 pounder.

943
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,860
So they have weight classes
and they put dogs on treadmill.

944
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:12,310
I get shit,

945
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,731
I get that.

946
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:14,020
They treat it like a sport.

947
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:15,280
I get that they treat it like,

948
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,581
you know,

949
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:17,770
like anybody else would
treat something professional.

950
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,890
But does that make it okay to
be breeding the dogs for that?

951
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,590
No,

952
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,423
and it certainly doesn't.

953
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,800
I mean I don't support it in
any way and I wasn't applying.

954
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,391
It does though.

955
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:26,760
I mean like that's what,

956
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,330
I'm a hypocrite though
because like I said,

957
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,970
less human fighting.

958
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,570
UFC.

959
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:31,811
No,

960
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:32,441
it's not really.

961
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:33,221
I mean they did.

962
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:37,270
Dogs get fucking bit by pit bulls and
I'm kind of kidding and I'm kind of

963
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:38,104
exaggerating,

964
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,220
but I did say it,

965
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:39,640
but I,

966
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,690
what I meant was,

967
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,140
I mean,

968
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,590
I am around voluntary human
violence amongst the most
intelligent species on the

969
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,090
planet,

970
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:46,250
right.

971
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,030
On a regular basis.

972
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,280
And for sure I know those guys enjoy it.

973
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,350
And I think the dogs enjoy it too.

974
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,430
I don't think they should do it.

975
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,460
I hated watching dogs fight and when I'd
come home and dogs would get angry and

976
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:57,711
you know,

977
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:58,321
sometimes it would do,

978
00:23:58,321 --> 00:23:59,620
it would be a fight over attention.

979
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,111
You know,

980
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:02,920
you'd come home and they decide
like one person wants to pet you,

981
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,793
wants to get pet,

982
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,890
and then the other dog wants to get pat
and they'll fucking growl at each other.

983
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,660
And it's really annoying,

984
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,130
you know?

985
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:09,440
And it's,

986
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,110
it's one of the things that happens
when you have a bunch of dogs.

987
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:12,900
But my,

988
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,220
my,

989
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,260
my point about pit bulls,

990
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:15,094
it was not that,

991
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,153
you know,

992
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,670
that it's,

993
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,860
there's anything good about what they do.

994
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,180
Are you just saying this is what they do,

995
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,050
this is what they did.

996
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:21,170
Right.

997
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,230
And what did it mean?

998
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,180
Painting a dog could be bred to love
being pet just as much as it loves

999
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:26,690
aggression.

1000
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,523
No matter how aggressive,

1001
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,790
of course,

1002
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,870
over many generations.

1003
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:30,170
Well,

1004
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,140
my dog now is what's
called a regency mass tiff.

1005
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,610
And what a regency mastiff is,

1006
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:38,870
is a Neapolitan mass if that's bred with
a pit bull and within 1% or would it

1007
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:39,611
essentially is,

1008
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:44,300
is his big strong athletic
pit bull mastiff combination.

1009
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:46,130
But there's no dog aggression at all.

1010
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,480
And no people aggression.

1011
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,553
He's like,

1012
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,270
but it's because I know the guy who
breeds it and he breeds for the exact

1013
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:53,660
opposite.

1014
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,660
He breeds if the dog show
any aggression to anybody,

1015
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,710
done no breeding,

1016
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,510
right?

1017
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,300
He hasn't fixed,

1018
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,133
he has effects,

1019
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,040
but it doesn't kill them.

1020
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,120
He's not shooting him in the head.

1021
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,360
You know,

1022
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,761
he's a,

1023
00:25:02,761 --> 00:25:03,140
uh,

1024
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,770
he's a,

1025
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,350
a breeder who loves animals come over
his house when his dogs are playing with

1026
00:25:07,351 --> 00:25:08,660
this two year old daughter.

1027
00:25:08,661 --> 00:25:09,494
You know what I mean?

1028
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,640
It's like that's,

1029
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,290
you can do amazing things with animals
through breeding and what they've done

1030
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,150
with the pit bull is an amazing thing.

1031
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,380
I've loved the dogs.

1032
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:19,250
They're amazing dogs.

1033
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,510
The Guy had one at the gym the other day.

1034
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,680
I couldn't stop petting it.

1035
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,360
They're fascinating
animals because of the gym.

1036
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,030
Jujitsu.

1037
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,863
Come on my friend,

1038
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,180
bring the pitch booth to the gym.

1039
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,930
Um,

1040
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,540
the,

1041
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:30,900
the,

1042
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,430
the thing about them is because
they've been bred that way,

1043
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:36,230
we're only the strongest,

1044
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:37,400
most aggressive.

1045
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,781
The ones with the,

1046
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:38,931
the,

1047
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:39,081
the,

1048
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:42,110
the most impenetrable will.

1049
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,080
Those are the only ones that are allowed
to breed in the dog fighting community.

1050
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,250
The other ones are called,

1051
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:46,611
you know,

1052
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,580
they're either killed or they're neutered
or they're given to people's pets.

1053
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,590
But when you have that,

1054
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:55,760
what you get is this
incredibly like energetic,

1055
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,080
intelligent animal.

1056
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,520
You get this survivor,

1057
00:25:58,521 --> 00:26:00,200
you get this like cream of the crop,

1058
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:01,880
genetic specimen of a dog.

1059
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,260
They're just fucking amazing.

1060
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,340
I feel the same way about Yorkie.

1061
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:09,341
Poos fucking you get the adorableness of
the Yorkshire and get the intelligence

1062
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:10,680
of the poodle.

1063
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,100
I mean,

1064
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,310
who doesn't want that on a
calendar or in their living room?

1065
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:13,581
Yeah,

1066
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:14,414
we have a pit bull.

1067
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,621
Once you have a pit bull,

1068
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:16,700
it's very hard to take other dog.

1069
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:17,534
Seriously.

1070
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,171
Yeah.

1071
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:19,690
German shepherds are pretty
easy to take serious,

1072
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:19,951
so they're,

1073
00:26:19,951 --> 00:26:20,490
they're pretty good.

1074
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,323
My buddies,

1075
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,720
my buddy's cousin trains German
shepherds are smart dogs.

1076
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,660
He trains them for like celebrities and I,

1077
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,081
he,

1078
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:29,390
I guess he taught Jay z's dog diamonds.

1079
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,820
Really tell the German shepard diamonds,

1080
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,640
but it's Jay z.

1081
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,630
But I think that's so awesome.

1082
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,493
Oh that's hilarious.

1083
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,450
And not the coolest thing ever.

1084
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,080
You had German shepherds are super,

1085
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:39,651
super smart.

1086
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:41,420
You can't just leave a
German shepard in the yard.

1087
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,300
They'll find a way out,

1088
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:42,680
man.

1089
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,513
They don't like it.

1090
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:43,860
They'll,

1091
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,061
they,

1092
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:44,281
they,

1093
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:44,700
you know,

1094
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,030
they'll,

1095
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,510
they'll,

1096
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,290
if they have to,

1097
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,220
they'll stay in the yard,

1098
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,140
but they get bored really quick.

1099
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:50,610
They're task oriented animals.

1100
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,170
They Swat team members,

1101
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,210
you know they are treated like
Malcolm was a smaller version of,

1102
00:26:56,211 --> 00:26:58,590
you said it looked just like German
shepherds but a smaller same thing.

1103
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:00,420
You know those dogs were super smart.

1104
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,020
Both German shepherds at the pound today,

1105
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,490
both just standing at attention
now barking or anything and that

1106
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,400
they're great dogs.

1107
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,060
German shepherds are great dogs.

1108
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,870
I had a German shepherd,

1109
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:13,650
a my grandfather had one
when I was growing up.

1110
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,060
What a great dog it was.

1111
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:18,780
It was literally a dog would like go
check on things like watch over the kids.

1112
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,250
Like the kids will be playing.

1113
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,700
Like my cousins will be planned and the
dog would just stand there and watch

1114
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:25,590
over them and make sure everybody's okay.

1115
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,690
Right and make sure nobody
ultimately helps you guys.

1116
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:27,931
Cool.

1117
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:28,430
You need anything.

1118
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,620
If people would like walk by the front
if like he was by the babies and the

1119
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:35,100
little kids and little kids are playing
and people would walk by the front gate,

1120
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,670
the dog would take two steps towards
the fence just in case he needed to go.

1121
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:39,504
Jackson Buddy,

1122
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,180
just take two steps and then he
would look back at the little kids.

1123
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:43,800
Look back at the Lucas and I'm like this.

1124
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:44,551
I was like six.

1125
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:45,091
And I realized that.

1126
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:45,331
So I'm like,

1127
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,200
this mother fucker's guarding these dogs.

1128
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,620
The dog is guarding them.

1129
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,860
You don't see that from very many dogs
and those talks and give a fuck about

1130
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:53,581
some of these babies.

1131
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:54,420
So fuck this baby,

1132
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,931
you know,

1133
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:55,741
licking my balls.

1134
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:55,951
Let me,

1135
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:57,630
let me eat some food they can strip later.

1136
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,603
Yeah,

1137
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,960
this is a totally
different animal is weird.

1138
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,190
Hey,

1139
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,390
you mentioned Michael Vick did
his time and I don't want a Tan,

1140
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,310
gentle eyes too much,

1141
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:04,870
but I mean,

1142
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,040
I think it's crazy that that,

1143
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,430
you know,

1144
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,800
this occupies stuff's going on and I
haven't had a chance to talk to you about

1145
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:10,000
it.

1146
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,780
[inaudible] I don't know where
you fall or what you've seen,

1147
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:14,780
but it's crazy that those guys
haven't done any time yet.

1148
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,031
Well,

1149
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:15,691
there's no leader.

1150
00:28:15,691 --> 00:28:16,410
That's the thing.

1151
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:16,831
You know,

1152
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:20,160
they're trying to find someone to put
away where they can stop the movement.

1153
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,580
The scariest thing about occupy Wall
Street for them is that there's no one

1154
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:24,630
person with a megaphone.

1155
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:25,150
Right.

1156
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,610
It's the only reason
they're lasting so long.

1157
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:26,851
I mean,

1158
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:27,391
it could be,

1159
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:28,460
it's getting bigger too.

1160
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:28,541
It,

1161
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:28,740
it's,

1162
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,360
it's bigger and bigger every day.

1163
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:32,220
This is the beginning of something huge,

1164
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:32,520
right.

1165
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,320
This is not just what it looked like.

1166
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,880
You know what it looked like.

1167
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,720
It was like one of them fucking Glenn
Beck rallies that just got got real long,

1168
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,340
lasted a while and everybody's pissed.

1169
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:41,551
Yeah,

1170
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:41,941
I get that.

1171
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:42,361
You're pissed.

1172
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:43,194
I'm pissed too.

1173
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,940
But then after a couple
of weeks it's like,

1174
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:46,290
this is not the same.

1175
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,070
This is a different feeling and this has,

1176
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,160
this has an overthrow.

1177
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,630
The government feel to it.

1178
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,080
Yeah.

1179
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,291
I mean,

1180
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:55,380
I saw people out there for the first
time with giant signs that said audit.

1181
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:56,620
The Fed was like,

1182
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,980
I didn't see you guys out
here for any other alley.

1183
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,840
And maybe that's just because
my eyes weren't open enough,

1184
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:01,950
but I went,

1185
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:02,520
okay,

1186
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,870
if this is how it's going to go down,

1187
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:04,560
let's get it going.

1188
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:04,681
Well,

1189
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:07,650
I've had some discussions about this on
my message board and there's some real

1190
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:09,250
good points a lot of
these guys brought up.

1191
00:29:09,251 --> 00:29:09,881
Did I agree with,

1192
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:14,500
and one of them is that there's
not a lot of cohesive message to,

1193
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,810
to this thing,

1194
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,230
right?

1195
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,200
It's like there's so many different people
with so many different ones that does

1196
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:20,100
happen with any movement.

1197
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:20,401
Sure.

1198
00:29:20,401 --> 00:29:20,761
Absolutely.

1199
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,290
It's important movement with no leader,

1200
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:22,531
right.

1201
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:23,550
You know that they go
there and they were like,

1202
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:25,050
stop the drone killings,

1203
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:25,381
you know,

1204
00:29:25,381 --> 00:29:27,420
and there's p to people there and there's,

1205
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,600
there's fucking solar people there and
have people there and there's legalize

1206
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:33,180
marijuana people there and everyone's
got their own signs and it's,

1207
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:35,340
and it's not just occupy Wall Street,

1208
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,230
it's everything that sucks.

1209
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,070
And I don't got,

1210
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,320
had a sign that said Shit's fucked
up and it's bull shit was like,

1211
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:41,831
awesome.

1212
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:42,790
Abso-Fucking-Lutely

1213
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,260
dude,

1214
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,021
it's fucked up.

1215
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:46,030
So that's reason enough to get out there.

1216
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:49,870
And right now the major concern is
watching special interest groups,

1217
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,010
agent provocateur tours,

1218
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,910
watching them try to roll into the fray
and do their youtube videos to fight

1219
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:55,211
back.

1220
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,710
And they're CNN coverage.

1221
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,710
Took a picture of the protest
and in a certain direction.

1222
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:03,100
It's so fascinating to watch the
way the steps were outlined for it.

1223
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,150
Here's what happened to the tea party.

1224
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:06,430
Here's how every other
movement has been marginalized.

1225
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,211
Excuse me,

1226
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:07,571
coffee,

1227
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:08,404
bad,

1228
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,371
marginalized,

1229
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:11,110
every other movement for years,

1230
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,590
and to watch those steps playing out
right now with occupy Wall Street and

1231
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:17,080
seeing if it's going to thrive or if
it's going to crumble in on itself.

1232
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,110
Do you think there's some
really marginalize the tea
party or do you think they

1233
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:21,340
just did it to themselves?

1234
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,170
The people who truly,

1235
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,740
and this is,

1236
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,470
this is from reddit articles and from
what I can come together on Wikipedia,

1237
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:30,550
but the people who were at the true
heart of the original tea party,

1238
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,800
we're anti Federal Reserve.

1239
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,360
They were anti big banks,

1240
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:36,390
they were anti corporations
and a lot of people said,

1241
00:30:36,391 --> 00:30:36,481
well,

1242
00:30:36,481 --> 00:30:37,510
they're Ron Paul supporters,

1243
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:38,261
so they got lumped in as,

1244
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:38,441
okay,

1245
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:38,980
you're,

1246
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,621
you're Ron Paul,

1247
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:40,361
so you're Republican.

1248
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:40,661
And they're like,

1249
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:40,871
wait,

1250
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:42,880
but we're not necessarily Republican.

1251
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:43,031
I mean,

1252
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:44,470
we do believe in subtle
Ron Paul's idea isn't,

1253
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:44,560
nope,

1254
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:44,771
nope,

1255
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:45,820
you're Republican now.

1256
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:48,580
We're going to get some crazies out
there with some hats that have tea bags

1257
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:48,910
dangling,

1258
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,190
teabags dangling from
him and send out flyers.

1259
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,040
You really think that someone's
sent those people out there.

1260
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:56,320
You don't think that there was a
lot of people that just joined in?

1261
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:56,501
No.

1262
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:57,340
There's certainly were.

1263
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,110
But do you think that it was orchestrated?

1264
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,650
I think,

1265
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,780
I think aspects of it were orchestrated.

1266
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:02,200
I think you,

1267
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,150
I think there's documented
proof of people doing that.

1268
00:31:04,151 --> 00:31:04,361
I mean,

1269
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:05,140
they already have,

1270
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,920
they already have agent provocateur tours.

1271
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,390
Of course,

1272
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,240
that Citi Bank thing where those guys got
the rest of the 40 people that were in

1273
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:11,800
a city bank trying to
close their bank accounts.

1274
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,450
Now they were being assholes.

1275
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,141
They were,

1276
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:14,741
they were being dicks.

1277
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:17,750
They're had their cardboard signs
inside a Citi Bank and they're shouting

1278
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:18,730
they're were being disruptive.

1279
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:18,950
Yeah.

1280
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,783
They weren't just just,

1281
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,100
just canceling their bank account.

1282
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,900
The guy who was the loudest,

1283
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:25,420
they're one of the guys who was allowed
us from videos that I've seen was an

1284
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:26,254
undercover cop.

1285
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,011
So he was,

1286
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:27,761
he was right in the,

1287
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:27,971
yeah,

1288
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:28,540
it's out there.

1289
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,560
So one of the,

1290
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:30,700
one of the ladies who went in there,

1291
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,511
she did protest.

1292
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:32,500
She did say her speech,

1293
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:33,460
but then she politely,

1294
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:34,660
after they told her to quiet down,

1295
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,823
and this is again,

1296
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,390
I can only cobble
together so many stories,

1297
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:40,090
but this is what I've
observed over a few articles.

1298
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,580
She quietly calm down.

1299
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,640
She closed her bank account.

1300
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:43,510
She was outside.

1301
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,760
They locked everybody in
because the police said,

1302
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:45,881
well,

1303
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:46,900
if they're disrupting business,

1304
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:47,441
hold them there,

1305
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:49,120
which I don't even for being an asshole.

1306
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,780
I don't think you can legally detain
somebody like that without the cops being

1307
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:53,614
there.

1308
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,940
Dude came outside.

1309
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:55,361
She said,

1310
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:57,880
I'm a customer showing them the
Citibank Bank receipts and stuff.

1311
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,361
She said,

1312
00:31:58,361 --> 00:31:58,471
I,

1313
00:31:58,471 --> 00:31:58,800
I,

1314
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:58,960
I'm,

1315
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,290
I'm,

1316
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,071
I'm supposed to be in there.

1317
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:01,060
I'm trying to cancel my account.

1318
00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:01,390
He's like,

1319
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,440
you were one of the protestors,

1320
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,940
grab Sir bear hold style and drags
her back inside the city bank to be

1321
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:07,690
processed.

1322
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,210
Wow.

1323
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,043
Citibank.

1324
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,180
This is hilarious.

1325
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,260
The Citibank protesters was saying
that the undercover cops set them up,

1326
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,850
you know,

1327
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,210
that there was a set up.

1328
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,300
So the one thing,

1329
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:19,930
this organ,

1330
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:20,231
this,

1331
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:21,760
this movement has going for it,

1332
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:22,571
which had remained,

1333
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:24,040
and it has me remaining so hopeful,

1334
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,810
is that they are so fucking connected.

1335
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,620
Like that's what makes it great
because the second bull shit happens.

1336
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,251
It's like,

1337
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:30,551
listen,

1338
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:30,701
yeah,

1339
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:31,301
that's one story,

1340
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:34,030
but here's 40 other angles of that event.

1341
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:35,020
Start to finish.

1342
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,310
You look at what happened,

1343
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:36,761
you know,

1344
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:37,181
and they showed,

1345
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:37,841
they showed a commercial.

1346
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:40,010
Right now there's an attack commercial
against the movement that has

1347
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,070
some crazy guy who's known
for being a crazy youtube guy,

1348
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,400
spouting antisemitic remarks
that people left and right.

1349
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,000
And there's one guy and there's
another dude that has a sign that was

1350
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:53,120
antisemitic and they'd cut back and
forth between this guy for like three

1351
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:53,954
minutes.

1352
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,140
You know,

1353
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,040
these guy with the sign,

1354
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:55,611
the guy with that,

1355
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:58,160
and there's video of
people at that protest,

1356
00:32:58,161 --> 00:32:58,994
shaming them,

1357
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,590
telling them to get the fuck outta here.

1358
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,030
This doesn't belong here.

1359
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,270
So you see the one message
and to go crazy antisemitism.

1360
00:33:05,271 --> 00:33:05,631
There you go.

1361
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:06,860
I get why people believe that.

1362
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:08,000
That's the message they see.

1363
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,630
But this movement is so connected that
there's a chance that you could see 40

1364
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:14,890
other perspectives on an event
and truly make it up for yourself.

1365
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,210
You can truly decide this Citibank arrest.

1366
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,550
Now that we're talking about this,

1367
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:20,550
and now that I'm going to,

1368
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:23,000
you told me this and
I'm going online and a,

1369
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,290
we'll tweet this stuff to.

1370
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,030
People are getting a chance to,

1371
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:26,480
uh,

1372
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,170
do you want one of those women?

1373
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,040
There's cold ones in there.

1374
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:28,940
Open,

1375
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,250
open the top and the bottom there.

1376
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,120
Bottom shelf there.

1377
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:32,571
There you go.

1378
00:33:32,571 --> 00:33:33,200
Fill up.

1379
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,033
Get one for everybody.

1380
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,413
Um,

1381
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:35,841
yeah,

1382
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:36,030
sure.

1383
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,440
Thanks.

1384
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,880
This is why they're saying that,

1385
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:38,080
uh,

1386
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,490
they know that the guy
was an undercover cop.

1387
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,890
It's because he fucking
arrested one of them.

1388
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:45,980
Once they got outside the fucking guy,

1389
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,170
he wasn't just an undercover cop.

1390
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,630
He was mocking them and laughing about it.

1391
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:52,460
He arrested one of the protestors outside,

1392
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,470
slammed her into a wall,

1393
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,660
and he pushed her back into the bank.

1394
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,543
Oh my God.

1395
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,693
There's video of that.

1396
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,820
He was at the precinct while they're
all getting arrested and he was laughing

1397
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:05,120
with fellow white shirt cops telling
them about what we'd been saying.

1398
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:08,540
Basically it was a bit startling
how inside their information was,

1399
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:13,100
how they were being paid to go to these
protests and put us in situations where

1400
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:16,130
we'd be arrested and not able to
leave and not be able to leave.

1401
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,240
That's amazing.

1402
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,720
It's not,

1403
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,460
it's not the only incident by a long shot.

1404
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,241
That's crazy.

1405
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:24,530
But who is in charge of this if
this guy's an undercover cop?

1406
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:24,801
Right.

1407
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:27,170
And where is this city bank branch?

1408
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,100
What,

1409
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,390
what part of the country was this?

1410
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:29,811
Uh,

1411
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:30,644
I don't recall.

1412
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:30,980
Oh,

1413
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,670
that sucks.

1414
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,520
I would like to know is it
not there on the article?

1415
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:33,981
The New York.

1416
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:34,790
It's in New York.

1417
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,510
While there you go.

1418
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,270
So you know who's Washington
Square Park police.

1419
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,470
Wow.

1420
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:39,861
They,

1421
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:40,041
uh,

1422
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,330
they set this woman up.

1423
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,080
This is,

1424
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,220
this is disgusting.

1425
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,050
It's not the only incident.

1426
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,780
This is disgusting that,

1427
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,643
that this,

1428
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,830
this should be fraud.

1429
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,720
We should be able to sue them for fraud.

1430
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,640
I hope they can misrepresenting our,

1431
00:34:53,641 --> 00:34:53,921
our,

1432
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:54,920
our tax dollars.

1433
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,640
And misrepresenting your
position to protect us.

1434
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:03,790
You are leading someone into an illegal
event and then you're the one who

1435
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:07,220
screaming shit out and you know
about kettling the process,

1436
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,040
the procedure of kettling
was that it's what the cops,

1437
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,240
they had a term for it.

1438
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,140
It's for cutting off large sections of
a crowd for arrest during a protest.

1439
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,670
So that Brooklyn Bridge arrest,

1440
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,880
there was a lot of views that depending
upon how you want to interpret the video

1441
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:20,714
that you're watching,

1442
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,800
those guys were kettled.

1443
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,020
So it means like they create a pot.

1444
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,101
In this case,

1445
00:35:25,101 --> 00:35:25,911
it was the Brooklyn Bridge,

1446
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:26,121
right?

1447
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:27,830
They cut off one end
of the Brooklyn Bridge.

1448
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,120
Then they told protestors,

1449
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:29,601
hey,

1450
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:29,781
you know,

1451
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:32,030
no foot traffic allowed on
the bridge into a megaphone,

1452
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:33,650
which if you've ever been to a rally,

1453
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,810
the first three people
can hear that megaphone,

1454
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:36,050
right?

1455
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,883
No one else fucking,

1456
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,100
no one else can.

1457
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,330
So they one officer in the very front.

1458
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,201
You guys can't be here,

1459
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:40,861
guys can't be here,

1460
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:41,694
guys can't be here.

1461
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,980
No foot traffic puts it away.

1462
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:44,461
All right?

1463
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:46,390
Everybody turns around and,

1464
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:48,000
and many of the protesters
felt that they were,

1465
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:50,610
there was a line of police
officers walking down the street,

1466
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,530
leading them on to the Brooklyn Bridge.

1467
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,393
Like acrossed it,

1468
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,800
the protesters thought
they had a minor victory.

1469
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,371
They were like,

1470
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:56,791
fuck yeah,

1471
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:57,361
Brooklyn Bridge.

1472
00:35:57,361 --> 00:35:58,194
We got this shit.

1473
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,730
The cops get about halfway in.

1474
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,600
They cut him off,

1475
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:03,510
they put the lid on the kettle and they
cut off this large group of protesters

1476
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:05,040
on bridge and arrested them all.

1477
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:05,860
Wow.

1478
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,150
It was like leading the
marching band like 700.

1479
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,290
That got a lot.

1480
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,070
Yeah,

1481
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,730
it's cowboys.

1482
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,540
Yeah,

1483
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,170
it really is.

1484
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,530
They were just hurting protesters.

1485
00:36:14,531 --> 00:36:14,690
Yeah.

1486
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,271
Hurting protest.

1487
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:16,104
You don't want man,

1488
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:16,651
but it sucks.

1489
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:20,370
This movement isn't anti-cop whatsoever
and it sucks that it's unfortunately

1490
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:22,110
only the bad and salacious stuff.

1491
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,040
It gets the news coverage wellness.

1492
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,110
That's important though,

1493
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:28,170
because people need to know what
can happen of course happened.

1494
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:29,220
We need to go about this.

1495
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,960
This Citibank Bank thing
is fucking disgusting,

1496
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,261
right.

1497
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:32,250
This is really gross.

1498
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:32,461
And,

1499
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:32,700
uh,

1500
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,550
if somebody just feels like
Citi Bank's a shit organization,

1501
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:37,710
they just want to go in there and
cancel their thing and maybe say,

1502
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,310
Citibank,

1503
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,410
I disagree with everything you're
doing and I want my money back.

1504
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,280
Good fun leave.

1505
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:43,620
So search the one that happened
today with Bank of America,

1506
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,780
because a woman goes
into a bank of America,

1507
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,630
she had a sign and there's
video of this whole thing again,

1508
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,160
I think don't preach,

1509
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,090
don't make a Ruckus,

1510
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:51,510
don't,

1511
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,860
don't try to be the youtube splash.

1512
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:53,550
But then again,

1513
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,570
here we are talking about it.

1514
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:55,860
So I guess it worked.

1515
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,090
Is this today you're saying?

1516
00:36:57,091 --> 00:37:00,030
I think it was today is that was something
from October 11th we're a bunch of

1517
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:03,580
women were arrested inside a bank of
America for return and trash from,

1518
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,680
for foreclosed home.

1519
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,120
No,

1520
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,251
no,

1521
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:05,340
no,

1522
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:05,600
no.

1523
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,331
I think it was from today.

1524
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:07,164
It was two women.

1525
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,220
One has a sign,

1526
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:08,581
she says,

1527
00:37:08,581 --> 00:37:09,301
I'm against you guys.

1528
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:10,200
I'm closing my account.

1529
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,100
She immediately goes in and like a branch
manager comes over to her and says,

1530
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:14,641
you can't be here.

1531
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:15,474
You need to leave.

1532
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:15,991
She's like,

1533
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:16,591
what are you talking about?

1534
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:17,281
You need to get out of here.

1535
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:18,180
I'm calling the cops.

1536
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:18,691
She's like,

1537
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:19,050
listen,

1538
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:19,441
I'm not,

1539
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:20,700
I'm just here to close my account.

1540
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,743
You can't,

1541
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:22,980
you're a protestor.

1542
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:23,910
I'm calling the cops.

1543
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,540
What?

1544
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,380
I haven't done anything.

1545
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:25,801
And she's like,

1546
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:26,640
I'll put the sign away.

1547
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,571
I'll put the sign away.

1548
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:28,920
No calling the cops.

1549
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,710
And it gets to the point where
she actually delivers the line.

1550
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,040
You cannot be a protester and
a customer at the same time.

1551
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,270
Whoa.

1552
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,103
Kick them out.

1553
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:37,980
Lock the doors.

1554
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:38,701
Oh,

1555
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:39,660
they just kicked him out.

1556
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:40,321
Yeah.

1557
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:40,741
Well I mean the,

1558
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:40,921
the,

1559
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:41,850
the cops wouldn't do it.

1560
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:42,121
I mean,

1561
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:42,810
come on man.

1562
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:42,911
I,

1563
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:43,350
yeah,

1564
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,000
but you can't be a protester.

1565
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:45,391
I know,

1566
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:45,960
but you didn't,

1567
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,890
they didn't arrest him.

1568
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:47,580
I Dunno.

1569
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:47,761
I mean,

1570
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:48,340
what do you want to do?

1571
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,900
And you want to be able to go to
a place where you work and uh,

1572
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:55,650
have a bunch of people standing around
yelling then what you're doing is bad or

1573
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,270
protesting inside your job.

1574
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:57,690
No,

1575
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,410
but again,

1576
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,280
you have to watch the video
because they will be doing,

1577
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:04,440
and she sat down with her sign and was
waiting to close the account again.

1578
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,280
I still think it's dickish to go
and make noise and shout at some,

1579
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,150
well a poor district manager that she's
the 1% because you know she's not,

1580
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:13,890
she's just doing her job too I think.

1581
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,930
And that's what banks are
like airplanes though.

1582
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:19,170
Like you really have to watch
what you do inside of a bank.

1583
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,441
Right?

1584
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:22,380
Especially if you have a sign you
don't know if you liked presents a bomb

1585
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:23,610
connected underneath their coat.

1586
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,391
You know what I mean?

1587
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:25,440
It's a little different.

1588
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,660
Like I feel weird wearing
an open shirt in a van.

1589
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:30,900
So somebody had a good point about occupy
Wall Street and they said all we need

1590
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:33,750
is one or two bounce checks
and the cops are with us.

1591
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,370
And that's so true because he cops

1592
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,210
are with us.

1593
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:39,640
You know it's the cops
are not fucking bankers.

1594
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:41,950
But did you see idea to
see the nice time release?

1595
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:46,951
The idea that you can get the cops to
act as protectors for these cock suckers

1596
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,240
is really dark.

1597
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,770
It's really dark when you think about it,

1598
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,600
that it could even be steered
in that direction now.

1599
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,000
What do you think it's
already happening though?

1600
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:55,691
In what way?

1601
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:55,871
I mean,

1602
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:56,071
I mean,

1603
00:38:56,071 --> 00:38:57,550
they were this one Citibank bank thing.

1604
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:57,791
Yes,

1605
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:58,150
I do,

1606
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,481
but I mean,

1607
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:01,690
they're like the police actions in New
York from checking ids to make sure

1608
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:02,050
you're loud,

1609
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,090
walk on certain streets.

1610
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:08,020
He had to have a Wall Street ID and have
an id that matched one of the addresses

1611
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:08,720
that you worked there.

1612
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,030
Don't you think that probably
has something to do with
terror attacks as well?

1613
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:12,320
I mean,

1614
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,940
they didn't do it before these protests.

1615
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:14,511
Right,

1616
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:16,910
but I mean know when you think they're
worried possibly that someone's going to

1617
00:39:16,911 --> 00:39:19,470
sneak through them if
there's so much fucking like,

1618
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:19,791
but I mean,

1619
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,760
does that pull and so much
attention in a certain area?

1620
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,070
I don't think it's just,

1621
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,460
it is a slippery slope.

1622
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,200
This protest has been violent security.

1623
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,550
This protest hasn't been violent.

1624
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:30,630
There've been outbursts,

1625
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,051
you know,

1626
00:39:31,051 --> 00:39:31,680
but they haven't,

1627
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,040
I mean that's like the officer Tony
Baloney to pepper sprayed those women that

1628
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:35,874
were in the net.

1629
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,780
I don't know if you saw that video,

1630
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,090
that guy lost 10 vacation days.

1631
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:39,750
That's it.

1632
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,583
That was his punishment.

1633
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,500
Really.

1634
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:41,700
Yeah,

1635
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,331
it happened yesterday.

1636
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:44,310
He lost 10 vacation days
for pepper spraying,

1637
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,150
but he's still a cop.

1638
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,230
Three one I was still a cop,

1639
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,101
doesn't get demoted,

1640
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:47,590
nothing.

1641
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:47,780
You know,

1642
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:52,780
he had also a some sort of a into some
sort of situation in 2004 when he abused

1643
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,850
they punch somebody I think.

1644
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:55,320
Yeah.

1645
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,970
But real quick to finish
that point though,

1646
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,510
you know you got guys like that out there
and you want those guys checking your

1647
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:02,400
id to make sure you work at a
building and it's like well you go,

1648
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,240
yeah it's for safety.

1649
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:08,190
But we have given up so many freedoms in
the name of safety and further erosion

1650
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:08,401
of that.

1651
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:08,580
Right.

1652
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,001
I agree with you.

1653
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:11,520
But just playing devil's advocate,

1654
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:15,390
what if you don't work for anybody who's
doing anything evil and you work on

1655
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:18,870
fucking Wall Street and you can't get
anywhere near your job because there's a

1656
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,280
million hippies out there beating drums,

1657
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:23,480
banging for the banks to close and you
don't even support the fucking banks and

1658
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:23,731
be like,

1659
00:40:23,731 --> 00:40:26,130
I hear Ya but I got to get over
there cause that's where I work.

1660
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:27,720
And they look you fucking of presenter,

1661
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,520
you fucking piece of shits
pressing and you know,

1662
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,040
meanwhile he's the person who works there.

1663
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:32,460
I don't know.

1664
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:32,610
I mean,

1665
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,160
I don't know.

1666
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,420
I hope that's not the
attitude of the protesters.

1667
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:37,141
I hope that they,

1668
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:38,310
and that's why I was a troubled,

1669
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,500
to see that woman called
the branch manager like,

1670
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:40,651
Oh,

1671
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:41,700
you're the 1% I'm like,

1672
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:42,240
again,

1673
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,010
this is just a motherfucker
trying to do their job.

1674
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,700
Yeah.

1675
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,620
I marched in the La Rally that they had.

1676
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,011
I was like,

1677
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:47,731
let's see this thing,

1678
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:49,380
if I'm going to put my
weight behind this at all,

1679
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:51,300
or I try not to get
too political at times.

1680
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:51,961
And I was like,

1681
00:40:51,961 --> 00:40:53,850
if I'm going to be
outspoken about this shit,

1682
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:54,840
I need to go down there.

1683
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:55,800
I need to see what it's like.

1684
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,970
And I'm shocked at how many people have
framed complex opinions about it and yet

1685
00:40:59,971 --> 00:41:02,010
haven't gone down to actually see one.

1686
00:41:02,011 --> 00:41:02,910
And when I was there,

1687
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,430
the Cross section of
society that I ran into,

1688
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:06,750
I feared didn't exist anymore.

1689
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,870
Truly amazing people.

1690
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,160
There's incredible people that for
every avatar dressed up head to toe blue

1691
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:17,550
hippie that's banging a bongo drum that
were three people there of all ages,

1692
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:22,320
all races that like understood that shit
is fucked up in this country and was

1693
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,850
trying to be positive about it
and trying to elicit change and,

1694
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:26,040
and,

1695
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,150
and so it was really nice feeling.

1696
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,890
I feel like there were,

1697
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,780
there were clear demands and there was a,

1698
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,290
you know,

1699
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,041
a good purpose to it.

1700
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:33,560
Then now it's been a little co-opted.

1701
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,150
How long ago was this?

1702
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:36,990
And they went out there?

1703
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:37,450
Yeah,

1704
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,420
I probably week or two ago.

1705
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:42,500
So you think it's being co opted by
nefarious forces that are working

1706
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,730
undercover?

1707
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,380
The try to sabotage things?

1708
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:45,860
Yeah.

1709
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,820
Like the Citi Bank thing?

1710
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,291
I think so,

1711
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:47,540
yeah.

1712
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,140
Really.

1713
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,240
And what did they do
that to every movement?

1714
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:50,541
I mean,

1715
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:54,200
from the attack ads to marginalizing
the message to entrapment.

1716
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,760
It's costing them a lot of money.

1717
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,061
I mean,

1718
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:57,980
I think it was a New Yorker
said something like that,

1719
00:41:57,981 --> 00:41:59,990
like they were going to
go bankrupt from this,

1720
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,531
you know?

1721
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:02,570
And so I think it was the cash.

1722
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,680
He's got billions.

1723
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,100
Right?

1724
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,281
Well,

1725
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:07,250
did you see that mayor job fuck
face while this was going on?

1726
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:09,820
I believe it was JP Morgan
Chase announced their,

1727
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:13,820
they're huge grant to Nyp d of like
four point $6 million or something like

1728
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:14,060
that.

1729
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,170
It might've been billion dollars.

1730
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,390
I'm not even joking is probably a million.

1731
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:18,140
You should Google it,

1732
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,110
but it's literally like as this is going
on and the cops are there protecting

1733
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:23,990
Wall Street and pepper spraying
civilians who are protesting it.

1734
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:29,230
Jp Morgan is making multimillion
dollar donations to the NYP D no.

1735
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,420
What are they going to
serve and protect man.

1736
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:33,351
So yeah,

1737
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:34,760
they might be one or two pensions away,

1738
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:35,390
but guess what?

1739
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,500
They're not going to lose their pension.

1740
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,160
Politicians don't fuck with the cops
because they know they need them there to

1741
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:42,290
protect them and protect the bankers.

1742
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,550
That is dark.

1743
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,010
That's why it was inspiring
to watch that marine.

1744
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,130
There was a fucking marine colonel that
was on the street and you want to talk

1745
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:49,940
about pit bulls,

1746
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,310
Joe?

1747
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:50,480
Yeah,

1748
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,000
I saw that go.

1749
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,210
That motherfucker was
inspiring and people were like,

1750
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,470
he only said three words.

1751
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:54,980
I'm like,

1752
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,210
it took him three words,

1753
00:42:56,211 --> 00:42:56,841
like it was like,

1754
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:57,920
there's no honor in this.

1755
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,450
Which is several more words than that,

1756
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,140
but it took only that from
that dude wearing that uniform,

1757
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:05,720
with that intensity to
shut those cops down.

1758
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,710
Cops couldn't say shit.

1759
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,100
They couldn't see his metals and shit.

1760
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,970
What do you guys do when you're on horses
trampling fucking innocent protest.

1761
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:15,650
You're supposed to protect these people.

1762
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,970
This isn't a war zone.

1763
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:18,320
These people don't have guns.

1764
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:18,500
Yeah.

1765
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,490
Why you heard in these people?

1766
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:19,821
There's no,

1767
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:20,840
there's no honor in this.

1768
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,180
That's all it took from that fucking guy.

1769
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,240
P Morgan Chase donates 4.6
million to Nyob during the pro,

1770
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:30,190
during the protest,

1771
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,390
so that's amazing.

1772
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,650
It's amazing.

1773
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:34,521
It's funny.

1774
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:36,170
Megan's parents as sin.

1775
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,190
It's gross.

1776
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,700
This is something that would
have happened a long time ago.

1777
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:40,800
We would would've never heard about it,

1778
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,940
but look at a site that that announcement
is on that's on their official

1779
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:44,774
website.

1780
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,220
It's not like they tried to hide this.

1781
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:49,670
It's not like somebody had to go digging
up some file to find some back alley

1782
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:50,504
deal.

1783
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:50,961
They were like,

1784
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:51,620
hey world,

1785
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,630
we just donated 4.6 million to the end.

1786
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,320
Why PD?

1787
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,730
That's how good we are as people.

1788
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,593
Wow,

1789
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,560
how gross.

1790
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,860
And then the cops are acting as if that
4.6 million is worth more than whenever

1791
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:08,120
these fucking regular people
pay out of their paychecks.

1792
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:11,360
Every God damn week and a
percentage of that for sure.

1793
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:11,461
Right.

1794
00:44:11,461 --> 00:44:12,830
It has to go to public service.

1795
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,680
The people that are in your community,

1796
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:16,071
man,

1797
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:20,300
the people that are that are fed up and
you are just going to bend over and take

1798
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:23,810
it up to Cooley for 4.6
from some fucking bankers.

1799
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:24,230
Yeah.

1800
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,860
That's amazing.

1801
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:29,860
Or an Adam Sandler movie that's happening
or how much is the movie cost it a lot

1802
00:44:30,411 --> 00:44:31,140
more than four.

1803
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,920
6 million.

1804
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,100
Well

1805
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,830
that's what that gross,

1806
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:33,663
but

1807
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,740
Adam selling my soul a
lot of fucking money.

1808
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:38,940
You might not like his movies,

1809
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:40,880
but I love little joke.

1810
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,670
I Love Adam said $6 million for a movie.

1811
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,504
He would cry.

1812
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,070
That would be a terrible weekend.

1813
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,260
So Ah fuck.

1814
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:49,223
What was

1815
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,590
talking about JP Morgan had
announces right in the middle of it.

1816
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:53,550
This is terrifying.

1817
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:53,890
So yeah,

1818
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:54,481
so here's what,

1819
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:55,120
here's one,

1820
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,490
one thing I'm going to attempt to do.

1821
00:44:56,491 --> 00:45:00,210
I'm going to try to raise some money to
do an APP to help facilitate protesters

1822
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:00,690
right now.

1823
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,350
Really?

1824
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,183
And how's that work?

1825
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,750
I got a couple ideas.

1826
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:04,020
I mean,

1827
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,250
I think right now I'd love
to see geolocation mixed
media chat rooms that you

1828
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:09,630
can join password protected,

1829
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:10,231
anonymous,

1830
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:10,830
whatever,

1831
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:11,663
you know,

1832
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,210
um,

1833
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,170
you'll log into the room,

1834
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,380
maybe I'll create occupy la and people
go in there and now we have a mixed media

1835
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,540
shared space with like
IRC style moderation,

1836
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,810
meaning whoever creates
that room can anoint.

1837
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,391
If I create a room,

1838
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:23,880
I can give you permission and you
permission to post directly to it.

1839
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,610
Everybody else chats in a
separate area of the APP,

1840
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,500
but allow people to push button,

1841
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:29,400
quick voice message,

1842
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:31,440
chat so you can quickly
communicate in a crowd.

1843
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:31,801
Like,

1844
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:31,981
Hey,

1845
00:45:31,981 --> 00:45:32,671
the cops are coming.

1846
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:33,990
Everybody fucking sit down,

1847
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,211
right idea,

1848
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:36,690
ma'am.

1849
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:37,021
Hey,

1850
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:37,440
they're there.

1851
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,340
Kettling us in.

1852
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,600
Pull up the Google maps,

1853
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,970
drop a pin on it and send that out
to the group so they can be like,

1854
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:42,271
all right,

1855
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,480
here's our new rally point and get there
all in names of keeping it peaceful and

1856
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:46,230
organized.

1857
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,290
If anybody takes a photo or tries
to live stream from within the APP,

1858
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,890
it would be geotag and
Hashtag automatically cause
you were in that group.

1859
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,600
So when it goes up to the web now,

1860
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,610
like right now I'm trying to
follow the protest and they go,

1861
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,520
cops are beating the dude in
a wheelchair and a Sacramento.

1862
00:45:59,580 --> 00:45:59,911
They weren't,

1863
00:45:59,911 --> 00:46:01,230
they were just a a kid in a wheelchair.

1864
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:02,064
So it's okay.

1865
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:02,820
Um,

1866
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,170
and he was just there after curfew.

1867
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,340
I had to track down four Twitter accounts
to find where that was happening and

1868
00:46:07,341 --> 00:46:08,174
click on the protest,

1869
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,300
go to the live stream,

1870
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:10,320
one live stream went down.

1871
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:10,581
I'm like,

1872
00:46:10,581 --> 00:46:10,890
it's,

1873
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:11,723
it's inefficient.

1874
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,040
If everybody organized
through one channel,

1875
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,121
all their media,

1876
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:17,640
you could pull up a map in real time
of all the shit that's going down the

1877
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:17,821
world.

1878
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:20,910
Click on a bubble and view it back
like a timeline and see when the room

1879
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:21,331
started,

1880
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:22,141
what people were saying,

1881
00:46:22,141 --> 00:46:23,190
what keywords were popping,

1882
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:24,210
what media was happening,

1883
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,340
where the videos were.

1884
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,770
You could piece up angles
based off timestamps and the
idea is you could really,

1885
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:32,550
you would have the most honest slice
of an event in history that's going on.

1886
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:32,970
It'd be,

1887
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:36,150
I think it would be amazing and would
help people on the ground really organized

1888
00:46:36,151 --> 00:46:36,960
and be safe,

1889
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,231
you know,

1890
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:37,830
safer.

1891
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:38,580
That's a great idea.

1892
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,930
They're there on Kickster quick,

1893
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,220
so I want to do it on Kickstarter.

1894
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,780
If someone hasn't stolen the idea already,

1895
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:43,441
I want to do it.

1896
00:46:43,441 --> 00:46:44,460
I've already started out and price,

1897
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:45,323
what do you call it?

1898
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,170
We gather.

1899
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,520
How about fuck the police and the
underground now because it'll never get,

1900
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:52,440
it'll never get funding
as I think I had it,

1901
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:54,230
like I riot fudge the playwright,

1902
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,390
I write it.

1903
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:56,700
I had a bunch of like angry,

1904
00:46:56,701 --> 00:46:57,331
aggressive names,

1905
00:46:57,331 --> 00:46:58,770
but the way to really sell it as to say,

1906
00:46:58,771 --> 00:46:58,891
well,

1907
00:46:58,891 --> 00:47:01,140
not only can this be used
to help facilitate marches,

1908
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:03,540
but if a group of 10
it's going to Disneyland,

1909
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,270
they can all create a group amongst
their friends and share their media that

1910
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:06,500
way.

1911
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:06,930
You know,

1912
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:08,430
that's how you should market it entirely.

1913
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:09,170
So what are you gonna call it?

1914
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,660
[inaudible] we gather it's
a social app and I like it.

1915
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,350
Someone touched,

1916
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,510
took the Dotcom and the
logo and everything else.

1917
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:16,344
So

1918
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:18,060
how dare you,

1919
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:18,720
I just wanted to get,

1920
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,560
I want the idea out there.

1921
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:20,201
I was going to sell the,

1922
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:20,960
I was not going to sell.

1923
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,180
Yeah,

1924
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,170
don't steal it.

1925
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,600
I hope if someone can
help me make that please.

1926
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,680
Why don't you register tonight?

1927
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,320
I could do it.

1928
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,021
I got a specked up.

1929
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:28,970
I know how much it's gonna cost.

1930
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,070
I think I'm just going to go out there and

1931
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:30,550
do it.

1932
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,330
Sounds brilliant.

1933
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:31,541
Thanks.

1934
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:32,590
Sounds like a brilliant idea.

1935
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,810
I think it'd be cool.

1936
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,040
And if you really want
your for Disneyland too,

1937
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:36,640
it would.

1938
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,000
And if you're at like a fucking Coachella
Coachella room with my friends and

1939
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:41,170
then we can keep our room private,

1940
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:42,070
but promote media ups,

1941
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,180
we can go to the public room.

1942
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,550
So you go to the Kentucky
Derby and you get lost.

1943
00:47:45,551 --> 00:47:48,010
You were a group of friends or you were
just at a cock fight and you want to

1944
00:47:48,011 --> 00:47:48,731
know where your friends are.

1945
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:50,500
I don't know whose wounds roosters on top.

1946
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,190
That's it.

1947
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:52,023
We gather.

1948
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:52,973
That's a great idea.

1949
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,110
I liked that a lot.

1950
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,020
So you're like a
revolutionary look at you.

1951
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,260
Well how revolutionary
would that image be?

1952
00:47:58,261 --> 00:47:59,290
Cause right now the crowds,

1953
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,050
the path of the violence and
the confusion comes from panic.

1954
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,150
The panic is coming from
a lack of communication.

1955
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:04,660
They've,

1956
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,540
when you see those people chanting
back what people are saying in a park,

1957
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,310
people think they're crazy
and it's like a cult.

1958
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,091
It's like actually no,

1959
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:11,680
they don't allow amplification devices.

1960
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:12,791
So people were just like,

1961
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:14,650
we'll loudly repeat everything
else that's happening.

1962
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,180
But you get enough people running a,

1963
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:18,910
we gather style APP pop in one ear bud.

1964
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,560
You can still hear what's
going on around you.

1965
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,590
You'll know exactly who's connected and
who is in that room by the side of the

1966
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:23,951
ear bud.

1967
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:26,830
And by glancing down at your phone
and just fucking push to talk,

1968
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:27,101
man,

1969
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:28,690
Jamie Kilstein made a tweet.

1970
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,560
This tweet will forever in my mind,

1971
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,960
body what is going on here?

1972
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,520
He made this tweet,

1973
00:48:36,521 --> 00:48:38,230
he was down at occupy Wall Street.

1974
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:39,760
He was talking about
how fucking crazy it is.

1975
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,050
He wrote,

1976
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:45,580
they just arrested a guy because
they thought he was the leader,

1977
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:46,510
period.

1978
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:51,070
There are no leaders
occupy Wall Street Hashtag.

1979
00:48:51,071 --> 00:48:51,461
And I was like,

1980
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:52,120
wow,

1981
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,810
like what a crazy movement that must be
for people where there's not one guy on

1982
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:59,700
a podium with a microphone is true truly
democratic movement right now you're

1983
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:04,470
rowing truly democratic going and how
the fuck do you silence that comes in.

1984
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:05,980
You got guys like like move on.

1985
00:49:05,981 --> 00:49:10,330
There's a petition on move on site to
have them to stop supporting occupy Wall

1986
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:10,601
Street.

1987
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:14,350
They're seen as a radical leftist group
and and very political and they have

1988
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:15,940
their own ties to corporations,

1989
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:16,321
et Cetera,

1990
00:49:16,321 --> 00:49:16,930
et Cetera,

1991
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:18,100
depending upon who you ask.

1992
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:21,910
So right now you can't have anybody
from a group like that Republican,

1993
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:22,421
Democrat.

1994
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:26,140
I don't give a shit who cannot have
groups with strong political ties.

1995
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,770
Funding your movement and you know
and and gathering in interest for your

1996
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:30,130
movement.

1997
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,190
We can't do that because that will
be used as fodder to shut it down

1998
00:49:33,191 --> 00:49:34,024
immediately.

1999
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:35,360
Did you see that?

2000
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,080
We are that the salt political party here,

2001
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,660
there's no political party
involved in any of this.

2002
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,380
There's Republicans out there
and libertarians out there.

2003
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,850
I think a lot of Republicans don't
think there were Republicans out there.

2004
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:46,990
That's a message that I run into.

2005
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:49,470
A lot of Republicans are
so God damn brainwashed.

2006
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:50,800
I don't even know what a Republican is.

2007
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,050
A lot of Republican Democrat,

2008
00:49:52,051 --> 00:49:55,090
so people that I would have registered
to be a republican if I really thought

2009
00:49:55,091 --> 00:49:58,270
that Ron Paul had a chance or a
that Gary Johnson had a chance.

2010
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,580
W W w what a real republican
is supposed to be,

2011
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,340
but I was supposed to be
about small businesses.

2012
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:03,970
Stay the fuck out of
people's personal lasts.

2013
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:04,480
Ron Paul.

2014
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:04,691
Yeah,

2015
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:05,950
a real Republican.

2016
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:06,940
By the way.

2017
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,770
We wouldn't give a shit
if you got married.

2018
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:09,371
If you were gay,

2019
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:12,730
a real Republican wouldn't give a shit
about what religion you want to practice

2020
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:13,301
your business.

2021
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,610
As long as the government
doesn't tell me if it's okay.

2022
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:19,960
Your business [inaudible] republican
polar opposite of that right now would

2023
00:50:19,961 --> 00:50:23,950
never be wanting to intersect
religion in with politics.

2024
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:28,100
W what's gone on in this country is
people like always lump themselves

2025
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,000
in a fucking teams,

2026
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:31,220
whether it's windows versus Mac or the,

2027
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:32,420
which is why we can't,

2028
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,870
you know why they can't allow a certain
group that represents a certain team or

2029
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:39,680
a certain color or fucking animal glom
onto their message and they're going to

2030
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:40,401
have to communicate better.

2031
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:41,240
To do that is,

2032
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:44,330
this is the big question about this
occupy Wall Street thing is that it's

2033
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:49,250
already gotten way past a boiling point
and it's gotten to a point where if the

2034
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:52,730
economy doesn't improve and these
people don't have to go back to work,

2035
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,700
well what the fuck is going
to stop them from escalating?

2036
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:56,031
Right?

2037
00:50:56,031 --> 00:50:58,730
The fuck is going to stop this
from getting bigger and bigger.

2038
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,810
I love when people give me a job,

2039
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,171
get a,

2040
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:00,771
get a job,

2041
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:01,250
you hippie,

2042
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,031
get a fucking job.

2043
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:02,211
It's like,

2044
00:51:02,211 --> 00:51:03,630
why do growing create one for me?

2045
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,480
You talk to create one
for me and I'll take it.

2046
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,201
That's why I'm out here,

2047
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:06,840
asshole.

2048
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,880
Everybody this was get a job.

2049
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:08,714
Today is an asshole.

2050
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:09,983
Yeah,

2051
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,010
let's get a job to be
interesting to see what happens.

2052
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:13,700
Come winter.

2053
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,720
It's 10% unemployment and that's just for
people who are fucking registering for

2054
00:51:17,721 --> 00:51:18,530
unemployment.

2055
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,370
That people that aren't even know.

2056
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,580
That's why those numbers are screwing man.

2057
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,100
Then when they say the countries,

2058
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,590
9% or 10% of what it is,

2059
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,620
that's just people that are like
registering for unemployment,

2060
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:28,190
right?

2061
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,820
How many people are not eligible for
unemployment and they're still unemployed,

2062
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,030
right?

2063
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,970
How many people have used up their
unemployment and there's still unemployed?

2064
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,250
You know it's because of
playing world of Warcraft.

2065
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:38,330
It's because they have no drive.

2066
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:39,740
It's because they're alcoholics.

2067
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:40,574
It's because there,

2068
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:44,090
let's paint whatever negative picture
we can on the fact that some people get

2069
00:51:44,091 --> 00:51:46,690
down on their luck sometimes
despite Herman Cain,

2070
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:48,351
Herman Cain is,

2071
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,480
it's your bad and your ass bleeding.

2072
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,930
It's not cause I raped you
cause you didn't resist it.

2073
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:53,783
You have a hard enough,

2074
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,430
he's wrong.

2075
00:51:55,431 --> 00:51:56,870
But isn't he right too?

2076
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:57,931
Isn't he like he,

2077
00:51:57,931 --> 00:52:01,970
he's absolutely wrong and there's
certainly people in certain situations and

2078
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,391
there's,

2079
00:52:02,391 --> 00:52:04,910
there's for sure people
get a shit roll the dice.

2080
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:05,151
Man.

2081
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:05,661
I've seen it,

2082
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:08,750
we've all seen it and some people are
just fucking lazy and want to suck off the

2083
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:12,800
teat and a lot of individual greed led
to the situations that we have right now.

2084
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:13,070
There's,

2085
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:13,490
there's,

2086
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:14,700
it's so multifaceted.

2087
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:15,920
He's right and he's wrong.

2088
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:16,731
Exactly.

2089
00:52:16,731 --> 00:52:18,620
What I was going to say
is that his point is,

2090
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,940
it's very simple and generalized,

2091
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:27,970
but the reality is many a person has gone
from intense poverty to immense wealth

2092
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,860
and they've done it by
bulldog determination,

2093
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:31,860
but they did it when the game was,

2094
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:32,540
what?

2095
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,231
I don't know about that.

2096
00:52:33,231 --> 00:52:33,730
I think too,

2097
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:34,670
we're doing that right now,

2098
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:38,360
even while the game is rigged
harder though it is most
certainly so much harder.

2099
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,450
What do you think is changed?

2100
00:52:40,451 --> 00:52:42,230
And as far as the game being rigged,

2101
00:52:42,231 --> 00:52:42,351
I mean,

2102
00:52:42,351 --> 00:52:46,070
what is the interest rates are much
higher for credit cards and you know,

2103
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:46,251
it's,

2104
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:47,600
it's harder to get a loan for,

2105
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:49,650
for businesses to buy a house.

2106
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:50,660
Jobs that you can get.

2107
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:51,494
But what other,

2108
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,700
how else has it rigged?

2109
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:53,351
I think like,

2110
00:52:53,351 --> 00:52:54,550
I think the jobs that
you can get right now,

2111
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:56,600
I mean the dollar is being so manipulated.

2112
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,620
I think first of all,

2113
00:52:57,621 --> 00:52:58,150
t to,

2114
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:59,810
to get something big going.

2115
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:00,230
Do you want,

2116
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:01,580
you want to get Bill Gates money,

2117
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,690
you want to get that kind of money.

2118
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:03,620
You want it to be a baller,

2119
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,760
you gotta make your own shit.

2120
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,900
You gotta make your own shit.

2121
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,060
You got to create your own thing,

2122
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:08,691
your own business,

2123
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:09,231
your own boss.

2124
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:11,090
So we'll do whatever
the fuck you got to do.

2125
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,350
But it's gotta be your own thing.

2126
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:14,390
That's the only way you make
monumental kind of money.

2127
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,070
And so,

2128
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:15,270
you know,

2129
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,850
what sucks in this country.

2130
00:53:16,851 --> 00:53:17,631
And cellular sucks.

2131
00:53:17,631 --> 00:53:18,770
So I'm going to start my own,

2132
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,720
my own carrier throughout
and then make an awesome,

2133
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:22,070
but the game is rigged against me.

2134
00:53:22,071 --> 00:53:23,360
I can't rule out history.

2135
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:24,650
People have figured out a way.

2136
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:27,870
People have figured out a way in the
darkest times to make shit piles of money.

2137
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,120
So he's wrong in,

2138
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:30,570
in generalizing right down,

2139
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:31,320
but he's also right.

2140
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,250
Is this possible?

2141
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,910
It's just most people aren't willing to
do the work to create the possible there

2142
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:36,201
you,

2143
00:53:36,201 --> 00:53:36,530
you,

2144
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:40,680
you have to become like a madman to
become super Uber successful in the middle

2145
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:41,910
of a fucking wipe down economy,

2146
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,990
but there is no middle class anymore.

2147
00:53:43,991 --> 00:53:44,370
That's what the,

2148
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:44,620
yes,

2149
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,970
I think it does take that drive.

2150
00:53:45,971 --> 00:53:46,391
It does take,

2151
00:53:46,391 --> 00:53:49,990
I think you said like Steve Jobs ran
himself at 11,000 rpm every day and just

2152
00:53:49,991 --> 00:53:50,591
putting himself out.

2153
00:53:50,591 --> 00:53:52,570
It does take that to be at his level,

2154
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,760
but these aren't people in Times Square.

2155
00:53:54,761 --> 00:53:58,120
I'm getting back to the movie and I don't
think these are people that want to be

2156
00:53:58,121 --> 00:53:59,350
Steve jobs necessarily.

2157
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:00,130
You know,

2158
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:01,040
they just want jump.

2159
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:02,160
They just don't take a job.

2160
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:02,621
I just want it.

2161
00:54:02,621 --> 00:54:03,940
They want a modest house in a modern age,

2162
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:06,740
no modest neighborhood used to be
able to get them from working possible

2163
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:07,200
anymore.

2164
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,860
I mean for some people I don't think it is

2165
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,500
impossible.

2166
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:11,543
Is that a real,

2167
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:12,480
is that possible?

2168
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:13,314
That something could be,

2169
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:13,951
I don't think,

2170
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,360
I don't think anything is impossible.

2171
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,051
Absolutely not.

2172
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:17,240
But should we hang our hats on it?

2173
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:17,520
No.

2174
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:17,731
No,

2175
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:18,520
but

2176
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:18,881
fiber,

2177
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:19,241
so let's,

2178
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:20,980
let's say the unemployment,

2179
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:22,450
the legit unemployment numbers,

2180
00:54:22,451 --> 00:54:23,980
15% is probably worse than that,

2181
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,050
but let's say it's 15% nationwide.

2182
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:29,800
It's still means 85% of the people who
are working and if 85% of the people

2183
00:54:29,801 --> 00:54:30,161
we're working,

2184
00:54:30,161 --> 00:54:30,910
why can't you work?

2185
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:31,181
Is it,

2186
00:54:31,181 --> 00:54:31,481
is it,

2187
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:32,740
is there a way to get through,

2188
00:54:32,741 --> 00:54:33,574
you know what I'm saying?

2189
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,151
You know what I mean?

2190
00:54:34,151 --> 00:54:37,900
I'm not saying that you can't really
say there is no middle class for sure.

2191
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,540
The situation is fucked up for sure.

2192
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:43,960
We're in a terrible financial situation
where we've realized that we've been

2193
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:45,100
scammed all these years,

2194
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,460
essentially defrauded and
lied to and w you know,

2195
00:54:48,461 --> 00:54:49,241
we have a congress.

2196
00:54:49,241 --> 00:54:50,350
It's bought and paid for it.

2197
00:54:50,351 --> 00:54:50,650
It's really,

2198
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:51,483
it's pretty obvious.

2199
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,241
No one's,

2200
00:54:52,241 --> 00:54:54,040
no one's prosecuting any
of these fucks you up.

2201
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,480
They're going after pot is,

2202
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,021
I mean,

2203
00:54:56,021 --> 00:54:56,720
you know what's,

2204
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,610
what's going on is shameful
in 2011 with the Internet,

2205
00:55:00,611 --> 00:55:03,460
with the access to information that we
have that the government conducts its

2206
00:55:03,461 --> 00:55:06,850
business this way is
absolutely completely shameful,

2207
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:08,440
but people,

2208
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:10,300
some people are still doing okay.

2209
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,590
Some people are still getting,

2210
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,020
I'm one of those people
I'm doing all right.

2211
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,610
I made some opportunities to myself.

2212
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:17,380
I've been working my ass off
since I was 12 years old.

2213
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:17,531
I mean,

2214
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:18,341
I think it's possible,

2215
00:55:18,341 --> 00:55:18,881
but again,

2216
00:55:18,881 --> 00:55:19,360
I don't,

2217
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,830
I'm not saying there isn't a middle class.

2218
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,730
They're clearly still is,

2219
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,070
but it is shrinking exponentially.

2220
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:29,590
Be of Bay just offloaded a bunch of
fucking bad assets to a two to a branch of

2221
00:55:29,591 --> 00:55:29,891
their arm.

2222
00:55:29,891 --> 00:55:34,480
It's FDI seed have dic insured here in
the states that were European assets.

2223
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:35,270
They did this thing,

2224
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,630
it's not supposed to be legal
swiped over a bunch of stuff.

2225
00:55:37,631 --> 00:55:38,770
So if the euro fails,

2226
00:55:38,771 --> 00:55:40,240
if there's a financial crisis there,

2227
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,320
the American taxpayers could end up
bailing out the European banks by

2228
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:45,250
transferring their assets.

2229
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:45,610
I mean,

2230
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:46,000
it's,

2231
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,833
so again,

2232
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,660
I'm doing all right right
now bank of America too,

2233
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:50,241
but like,

2234
00:55:50,241 --> 00:55:53,560
who's the one guy that just donated a
shitload of money to Bank of America?

2235
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,560
Like some singer or something like that,

2236
00:55:56,561 --> 00:56:01,150
just donated a shitload of money to
a bank to bank and Aragon singer.

2237
00:56:01,151 --> 00:56:02,530
There's some celebrity guy here,

2238
00:56:02,531 --> 00:56:03,100
I'll find out.

2239
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:03,360
Hmm.

2240
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:03,601
Yeah,

2241
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:04,260
find out.

2242
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,570
I've never heard of anybody
don't money to a bank.

2243
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,220
That's so crazy.

2244
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,560
With all the connectivity that
we have in this day and age,

2245
00:56:09,561 --> 00:56:10,101
just as you're saying,

2246
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:12,020
it's crazy that the government
is run the way it is,

2247
00:56:12,021 --> 00:56:12,241
right?

2248
00:56:12,241 --> 00:56:12,850
Yeah.

2249
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:13,840
When I going to pay taxes,

2250
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:15,590
that's what this protest is all about.

2251
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,030
A week.

2252
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,860
But so this is,

2253
00:56:18,861 --> 00:56:19,910
this is a pipe dream,

2254
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:20,811
but why not?

2255
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:21,050
You know,

2256
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:22,220
I pay my taxes online,

2257
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,083
pay a lot of taxes,

2258
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:23,640
right.

2259
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,280
And they

2260
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,210
trusted enough to be verified and it's
my social security number and blah,

2261
00:56:27,211 --> 00:56:27,381
blah,

2262
00:56:27,381 --> 00:56:27,731
blah,

2263
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:29,860
and there's the amount that I'm paying
and the government takes it state and

2264
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:30,340
federal,

2265
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:30,491
right?

2266
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:30,970
Right.

2267
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,290
If I can pay my taxes online,

2268
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,610
we can do a system that does that.

2269
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:39,010
Why can't I pay my taxes
and then a portion of those
taxes directly to the funds

2270
00:56:39,011 --> 00:56:41,080
and the projects and
the things that I want.

2271
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,540
Let me vote truly
democratically with my dollars.

2272
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:43,871
Now,

2273
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:45,340
if we have to set minimum levels,

2274
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:45,581
you know,

2275
00:56:45,581 --> 00:56:47,890
for defense spending or you know,

2276
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,080
well,

2277
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,370
you're talking crazy now.

2278
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:49,870
Why?

2279
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:50,531
Because first of all,

2280
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:51,550
this isn't a democracy,

2281
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,750
but why not dream as a
representative free book,

2282
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:56,410
right?

2283
00:56:56,410 --> 00:57:00,760
That's what we are represented
by a handful of people
that the commercial zone,

2284
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:03,490
you don't even get to know
where your money goes.

2285
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:03,541
You,

2286
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:04,790
they don't even have
to give you a receipt.

2287
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,080
How great would that be if I could decide
where it's going to be sad by the way

2288
00:57:08,081 --> 00:57:08,681
that you pay,

2289
00:57:08,681 --> 00:57:09,514
like what do you,

2290
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,860
you're probably in like a
38% tax bracket or something,

2291
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:12,041
right?

2292
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:12,850
You're doing really well.

2293
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:13,401
One year,

2294
00:57:13,401 --> 00:57:13,780
uh,

2295
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,010
when I wasn't incorporated.

2296
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,790
Like now I'm a quarter,

2297
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,440
like a work for myself as a corporation.

2298
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,970
But the last year that I wasn't,

2299
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:21,940
I paid 43 or 47% of my income to taxes.

2300
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,030
Let's just round that bitch off the half.

2301
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,620
You're paying half of your money.

2302
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:27,030
Half of it.

2303
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:29,830
You don't even get a statement that says,

2304
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:30,430
hey,

2305
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:32,440
you helped fix a road.

2306
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,420
You helped pay for cops.

2307
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,790
You helped support firefighters.

2308
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:38,590
You don't even get a fucking receipt.

2309
00:57:38,591 --> 00:57:39,970
They don't have to tell you shit.

2310
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:40,863
Nope.

2311
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:41,763
Warren Buffet,

2312
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,950
Warren Buffet donate it
to Bank of America and he,

2313
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:45,784
uh,

2314
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,290
he,

2315
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,850
I think he bought a bunch of stocks.

2316
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,773
Uh,

2317
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:52,090
he bought 357 million.

2318
00:57:52,091 --> 00:57:52,641
Is that what it's been?

2319
00:57:52,641 --> 00:57:54,370
Stock investors.

2320
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:56,260
5 billion and Bank of America.

2321
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:56,711
Oh,

2322
00:57:56,711 --> 00:57:58,090
well that's not donating buddy.

2323
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,231
No,

2324
00:57:59,231 --> 00:57:59,381
no,

2325
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:01,000
but he did it too to help them.

2326
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,290
That's what his reasoning was.

2327
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,180
I'm sure it was purely altruistic.

2328
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,550
He's also old as fuck
and doesn't give a shit.

2329
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:07,780
He's a weird cat.

2330
00:58:07,781 --> 00:58:09,490
That guy lives in like a regular house.

2331
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:09,971
You know,

2332
00:58:09,971 --> 00:58:10,571
he's a super,

2333
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:10,901
super,

2334
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:11,561
super rich guy.

2335
00:58:11,561 --> 00:58:13,210
He lives in like Middle America,

2336
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,050
lives in a regular high,

2337
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:17,950
really does not live
extravagantly by any means.

2338
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:20,410
And he is apparently a donated,

2339
00:58:20,411 --> 00:58:24,610
a substantial portion of his
riches to charities when he dies.

2340
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:25,780
Good for him.

2341
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,350
Good for him.

2342
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:26,531
Yeah.

2343
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:28,060
He's an interesting
cat that Warren Buffet.

2344
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:28,511
I like that.

2345
00:58:28,511 --> 00:58:28,760
I've heard,

2346
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,150
I've heard him vilified several
times so that's nice to hear.

2347
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:35,350
It feels bad for all the creepy shit
that he did to get a hundred fucking

2348
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:35,650
billion dollars or whatever.

2349
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:37,120
He's got stashed under his mattress.

2350
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:37,841
He just worked hard.

2351
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:38,141
Joe.

2352
00:58:38,141 --> 00:58:38,891
Anybody can do it.

2353
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:39,820
It's not impossible.

2354
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,730
You would talking about the videos that
disturbed you in that video of the um,

2355
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:45,300
the,

2356
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,140
the dog's getting killed earlier.

2357
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:49,720
There's something to disturb me way
more and I couldn't even watch it.

2358
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:50,531
I just heard about it.

2359
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:52,510
It was a baby getting run over and China,

2360
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,650
the baby got run over,

2361
00:58:53,651 --> 00:58:56,740
back and forth like a bunch of times
when people stepped over the body of the

2362
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:56,981
baby,

2363
00:58:56,981 --> 00:58:59,470
this video of them stepping over it
and nobody did a God damn thing about,

2364
00:58:59,471 --> 00:59:01,650
it was a two year old baby
just wandering around.

2365
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:02,500
Run over by a truck.

2366
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,880
The truck sees it or run over.

2367
00:59:03,881 --> 00:59:04,580
It,

2368
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,440
doesn't do anything about it.

2369
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:06,191
Gets back in the car,

2370
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:09,250
runs over it again with its back with
the back wheels and then another person

2371
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:09,610
runs over.

2372
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:10,443
I mean it's,

2373
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,120
we as human beings,

2374
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:13,420
man,

2375
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:13,900
you know,

2376
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,780
we have to look at what
do we like at our worst,

2377
00:59:16,781 --> 00:59:17,630
what do we like at the,

2378
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:17,911
at the,

2379
00:59:17,911 --> 00:59:19,960
the most callous and unloving.

2380
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:23,150
That's gotta be an example of
that right up there with war.

2381
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,070
At least leave a note like,

2382
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:26,090
sorry I hit your baby.

2383
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:27,110
Here's my license plate.

2384
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:27,920
I'm insured.

2385
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,690
You got to at least do that
cause that's fucked up.

2386
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:32,930
Well I don't know who's fucking baby
was just wandering around the streets,

2387
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:33,561
first of all,

2388
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:33,801
you know,

2389
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:34,390
were,

2390
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:35,990
there was no one that
did anything about it.

2391
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:37,460
They didn't even know
the baby was run over.

2392
00:59:37,461 --> 00:59:38,390
There was no screaming.

2393
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:38,781
There was no,

2394
00:59:38,781 --> 00:59:39,111
Oh my God,

2395
00:59:39,111 --> 00:59:39,944
where's my baby?

2396
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,180
It just when,

2397
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:45,830
when population density gets to a
certain number and the value of life

2398
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:50,120
diminishes because it's just too many
God damn humans and literally not enough

2399
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:50,990
food for people.

2400
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,030
So instead of someone being valuable,

2401
00:59:53,031 --> 00:59:54,110
you're actually a hindrance.

2402
00:59:54,111 --> 00:59:57,020
Everybody's a hindrance
or a resource drain.

2403
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:57,921
I'm sorry,

2404
00:59:57,921 --> 00:59:58,371
but that's,

2405
00:59:58,371 --> 00:59:58,611
you know,

2406
00:59:58,611 --> 01:00:00,020
that's what you are at times.

2407
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:04,460
And thankfully Siri is going to figure
out how to turn us all into batteries and

2408
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:05,960
the Matrix is going to fucking happen.

2409
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:06,400
Guys.

2410
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,820
Siri is going to figure that shit out.

2411
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:08,001
Well,

2412
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:09,620
if it's not that and maybe aliens,

2413
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:09,861
you know,

2414
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:11,900
one of the things I've
always said about aliens,

2415
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:12,051
you know,

2416
01:00:12,051 --> 01:00:15,290
people think I have several friends
that are obsessed with aliens.

2417
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:16,520
Eddie Bravo being the biggest one.

2418
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:16,720
He,

2419
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,180
he fucking loves you.

2420
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:19,980
Loves the idea that there's,

2421
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:20,670
they're out there,

2422
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:20,931
man.

2423
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:21,270
They're out there.

2424
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:22,250
It's so exciting for him.

2425
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,150
It's so sexy for him.

2426
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:23,931
Me,

2427
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:24,890
I'm not so convinced.

2428
01:00:24,891 --> 01:00:25,051
I,

2429
01:00:25,051 --> 01:00:28,430
I look at around at all the God damn
video footage that people have on their

2430
01:00:28,431 --> 01:00:29,121
cell phones.

2431
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:31,700
And then I see the video
footage of Ufo and I'm like,

2432
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:32,450
this is horse shit.

2433
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:32,630
These,

2434
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,463
these are fake.

2435
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,150
And they just smelled to me,

2436
01:00:35,151 --> 01:00:35,984
they all stink.

2437
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:37,040
Nothing seems real.

2438
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,620
There's not a single
fucking video of anyone,

2439
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,221
you know,

2440
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:42,650
spotting a little gray man
running around in their backyard.

2441
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,613
I just,

2442
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,110
and that doesn't mean it's not real.

2443
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:46,220
It doesn't mean that if they were here,

2444
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:47,330
they couldn't avoid detection.

2445
01:00:47,331 --> 01:00:48,560
But I don't believe it.

2446
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:52,040
And my other take on it
is that if they did exist,

2447
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,380
we probably wouldn't want them here.

2448
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:55,431
Because guess what?

2449
01:00:55,431 --> 01:00:59,600
They're not going to just let us
run things as usual and give us more

2450
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:02,060
information so we can blow
each other up quicker.

2451
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:02,690
No,

2452
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:05,450
they're going to treat us the same
way we treat dolphins and whales.

2453
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,010
We don't give a fuck about them.

2454
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:07,461
You know,

2455
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:07,651
we,

2456
01:01:07,651 --> 01:01:08,990
we kill whales every day.

2457
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,531
Not We,

2458
01:01:09,531 --> 01:01:10,341
not you and I obviously,

2459
01:01:10,341 --> 01:01:10,980
but people in this,

2460
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,200
in this world kill whales.

2461
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:12,800
Every day.

2462
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,640
We take dolphins,

2463
01:01:13,641 --> 01:01:14,690
we Americans do,

2464
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:16,220
and we locked them in fish tanks.

2465
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:19,940
We take these amazing animals and we put
them in a fucking swimming pool and we

2466
01:01:19,941 --> 01:01:20,930
don't give a shit about them.

2467
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:21,501
You know,

2468
01:01:21,501 --> 01:01:22,280
we really don't.

2469
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:22,601
We,

2470
01:01:22,601 --> 01:01:24,920
we just want them animals
escaped from a zoo.

2471
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:26,600
It's like that's cause
you put it in a prison.

2472
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:27,771
It escaped.

2473
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:28,604
It went home,

2474
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,300
asshole.

2475
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,390
Get free of your fucking then escape.

2476
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:32,931
You know,

2477
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:34,970
you lock this guy up for nothing,

2478
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,043
but why?

2479
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:40,130
Why would we think that anything more
intelligent than us would treat us any

2480
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:43,430
differently than we treat the most
intelligent things that we're aware of.

2481
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,520
Chimpanzees and dolphins and
the most Intel and an orchestra,

2482
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,320
the most intelligent
things that we're aware of,

2483
01:01:48,321 --> 01:01:49,370
we just locked them up.

2484
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,360
We don't give a fuck,

2485
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:51,020
man.

2486
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:51,351
We put,

2487
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:54,140
we experiment on them
and we put them in cages.

2488
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:56,300
We teach them how to do
tricks for our amusement.

2489
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:56,811
You know,

2490
01:01:56,811 --> 01:02:00,140
why the fuck would we think that aliens
would do anything different if we steal

2491
01:02:00,141 --> 01:02:00,951
their babies?

2492
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:01,490
Man,

2493
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:02,570
chimpanzees,

2494
01:02:02,571 --> 01:02:03,404
dolphins,

2495
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:04,190
orchids,

2496
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,510
we steal their fucking babies.

2497
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,160
What if we are a zoo for the aliens?

2498
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,380
We very well could be man very well,

2499
01:02:09,381 --> 01:02:10,820
but they are just
walking around right now.

2500
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:12,320
Invisible women can't believe
they're doing that shit.

2501
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:13,341
Oh my God.

2502
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:13,850
Well let's,

2503
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:15,530
let's make this guy do
that and see what happens.

2504
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,340
Oh my God.

2505
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:16,521
Well,

2506
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:17,360
if you think about,

2507
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:18,990
you know what we're capable of right now,

2508
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,660
he'd ever go to the wild
animal park in San Diego.

2509
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:22,920
Yeah.

2510
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,730
It's fucking amazing.

2511
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:23,941
Right?

2512
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:24,361
Huge,

2513
01:02:24,361 --> 01:02:25,194
huge place.

2514
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:26,220
You drive around there.

2515
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:27,900
I mean these animals have habitat.

2516
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:28,260
Dude.

2517
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,450
Did you ever feed the giraffes?

2518
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:31,351
I actually never went there,

2519
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:32,820
but that's where Cliffy
B is getting married.

2520
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,121
Oh,

2521
01:02:33,121 --> 01:02:33,571
is he really?

2522
01:02:33,571 --> 01:02:34,050
Yeah.

2523
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:34,480
Powerful.

2524
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,260
Like on a draft or I
somehow got it set up.

2525
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:37,441
Yeah,

2526
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:38,130
he's going get,

2527
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,000
he's a crafty dude.

2528
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:39,834
That sounds like something.

2529
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,430
It's um,

2530
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,540
it's an amazing setup.

2531
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:43,500
They have a lot of room.

2532
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:44,110
These animals,

2533
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:44,940
it's not ideal,

2534
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,773
but they have a lot of room.

2535
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,550
So just extrapolate that,

2536
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:50,370
take that to a hundred million years
of evolution or whatever the fuck,

2537
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:50,581
you know,

2538
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:51,630
who knows how long,

2539
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:52,080
you know,

2540
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:56,190
life can exist on uncertain planets and
they could be so fucking sophisticated.

2541
01:02:56,191 --> 01:02:59,460
They could have like not
just created a planet,

2542
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,570
but you know,

2543
01:03:00,571 --> 01:03:02,880
but engineered our whole environment.

2544
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:03,650
You know,

2545
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,400
what happens here on earth,

2546
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:08,310
the same way we do it with the ants
and video games are now people in the

2547
01:03:08,311 --> 01:03:08,671
sentence.

2548
01:03:08,671 --> 01:03:09,210
Like,

2549
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:10,043
what if they just,

2550
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:10,171
Oh,

2551
01:03:10,171 --> 01:03:10,561
let's see what,

2552
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:11,640
let's see how this one turns out.

2553
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:15,570
Could you imagine if the whole idea
of asteroidal impacts and you know,

2554
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:20,400
a mass extinction events was actually a
program cycle that we're just not aware

2555
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:20,690
of it.

2556
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:20,840
We,

2557
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,000
we,

2558
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,221
we,

2559
01:03:21,221 --> 01:03:21,481
we,

2560
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:25,920
we just are still assuming that there's
sort of a random nature to all these

2561
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,600
rocks out there colliding,

2562
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,010
but really they just happen every
certain amount of millions of years.

2563
01:03:32,011 --> 01:03:34,230
It's just some sort of a global reset.

2564
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,340
It just keeps going on
getting defragged until your,

2565
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:42,840
until your civilization
becomes so intelligent that
it can spot it and prevent

2566
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:43,200
it.

2567
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:43,351
You know,

2568
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:47,280
that's the mad race to test the mad race
is to get off the planet at some sort

2569
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,990
of an artificial environment
that you control,

2570
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:53,991
be it a large space ship
or a giant artificial plant
and to avoid all the cosmic

2571
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,100
impacts,

2572
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,720
solar flares,

2573
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:58,711
you know,

2574
01:03:58,711 --> 01:03:59,081
all the,

2575
01:03:59,081 --> 01:04:01,530
the really big shit that
happened supernovas you know,

2576
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:02,040
like when,

2577
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,270
when hyper Novas happened,

2578
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:03,451
you know,

2579
01:04:03,451 --> 01:04:07,620
everything anywhere near it in the galaxy
just gets cooked instantly and that

2580
01:04:07,621 --> 01:04:08,640
shit can happen to us.

2581
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:13,140
I hate that I wasn't fucking alive
for the space race and serious these

2582
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,033
railings,

2583
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,001
the notion of it,

2584
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:18,420
and it might be that I've
absorbed not as much,

2585
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,640
it's more about who can fire
lasers from satellites now.

2586
01:04:20,641 --> 01:04:24,210
It's not about like let's explore and
I know that was the bill of goods that

2587
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:24,691
were sold.

2588
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:26,820
I'm sure it had a lot to do with the
fence testing and everything else.

2589
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,070
But you know,

2590
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:29,490
if all the money that we did,

2591
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:30,420
and I know this is,

2592
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,090
this is just me wishing we could
vote with our tax dollars again,

2593
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:36,960
but like if a fraction of the money we've
spent blowing shit up and some other

2594
01:04:36,961 --> 01:04:39,510
fucking country was spent to
just solving something like,

2595
01:04:39,511 --> 01:04:39,830
uh,

2596
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,190
a problem for humanity here.

2597
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:41,341
Oh,

2598
01:04:41,341 --> 01:04:41,870
no doubt.

2599
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:46,380
It can be leaders again and we can be
positively revered and we could fucking

2600
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:47,340
help the world.

2601
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:47,521
Yeah.

2602
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:48,660
Well not even just dad.

2603
01:04:48,661 --> 01:04:49,141
I mean just,

2604
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:50,670
I'm going to sing that and curiosity,

2605
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,280
curiosity of expression of,

2606
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,030
you know,

2607
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,670
traveling the fucking
universe and finding out what,

2608
01:04:56,671 --> 01:04:58,290
what it is like on Mars.

2609
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:58,471
You know,

2610
01:04:58,471 --> 01:05:02,810
have you have humans set up some sort
of a civilization on Mars where they,

2611
01:05:02,811 --> 01:05:03,151
you know,

2612
01:05:03,151 --> 01:05:03,361
the,

2613
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:04,021
what is that called,

2614
01:05:04,021 --> 01:05:04,291
where they,

2615
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:04,530
you,

2616
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:05,820
you take a total recall.

2617
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,840
No way you'd take a,

2618
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:08,280
an environment and you,

2619
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:08,610
uh,

2620
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:11,940
you sort of engineer it to a Gio,

2621
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,710
Gio forming geo forming,

2622
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:16,150
you recreating more ozone.

2623
01:05:16,151 --> 01:05:16,351
All right,

2624
01:05:16,351 --> 01:05:16,831
let's do that.

2625
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:17,530
We need more.

2626
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:17,980
Let's ship

2627
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,410
that in creating a form on
this level and environment.

2628
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:20,800
You know,

2629
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,050
they,

2630
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,600
they said that you could do this,

2631
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,720
that you could take machines and
you could build them on Mars.

2632
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,381
Massive,

2633
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,191
massive machines,

2634
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:28,840
like literally the size of cities.

2635
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:33,100
Like it would be like a Manhattan size
machine and that machine would just be

2636
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:36,800
pumping oxygen into the environment
and that somehow or another with,

2637
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,910
it's called the reactor and Quade
starts it with his alien hand.

2638
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,100
Did you didn't see total recall?

2639
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:42,761
I did see that.

2640
01:05:42,761 --> 01:05:47,680
So is that what it was until it hits the
reactor reactor and the rods go in and

2641
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:49,300
the fucking oxygen on the planet?

2642
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:49,841
Oh,

2643
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:50,331
that's right.

2644
01:05:50,331 --> 01:05:52,510
It stopped Arnold's head from freaking
out when he's on the side of the

2645
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:53,344
mountains.

2646
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:54,820
Good.

2647
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,480
That's some stupid movies actually
based on real scientific ideas.

2648
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,850
The threat boob thing,

2649
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:02,043
every boob

2650
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:05,080
implant and the third one,

2651
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:05,950
no one's ever done it.

2652
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,420
You know when girls have three Nipples,

2653
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,440
I've never heard of a girl
really having three nibbles.

2654
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:09,530
Oh,

2655
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:10,240
you've never seen one?

2656
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:10,511
Yeah,

2657
01:06:10,511 --> 01:06:10,970
I know.

2658
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:13,180
I know guys and girls
that have three nipples.

2659
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:13,710
Really?

2660
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:14,543
Yeah.

2661
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:17,620
It's creepy because it's just like
the nipple part is not the areola.

2662
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:18,430
Oh Wow.

2663
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:20,380
So it's just like it
like this weird nipple.

2664
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,650
I guess that'll all freak
show genetic mishaps.

2665
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,860
You can have that ain't that bad.

2666
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,240
Actually.

2667
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:25,720
Nipple,

2668
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,590
who's going to complain,

2669
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,513
you know,

2670
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:28,390
just tried testicle.

2671
01:06:28,391 --> 01:06:29,380
Wouldn't be that bad either.

2672
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:30,250
Maybe.

2673
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,840
What if your loads are just overwhelming?

2674
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,870
Like there's some guys want that.

2675
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:35,441
Yeah,

2676
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:36,274
maybe it was too much.

2677
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:40,390
I saw a product called Max load
next to the checkout counter,

2678
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:42,210
GNC on the counter.

2679
01:06:42,211 --> 01:06:42,911
I took a photo of,

2680
01:06:42,911 --> 01:06:43,750
it made me laugh so hard.

2681
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:45,850
I tweeted it and it said come harder,

2682
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:46,930
come longer,

2683
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,130
come better.

2684
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,300
And it was like three
hits and it was like,

2685
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:49,811
you know,

2686
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:51,870
fucking Max load on the,

2687
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,180
on the counter that but at the checkout
counter like we're gonna take a penny.

2688
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:55,631
Leave a penny.

2689
01:06:55,631 --> 01:06:55,931
Should be.

2690
01:06:55,931 --> 01:06:57,850
It was like dudes come harder.

2691
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:58,541
That's,

2692
01:06:58,541 --> 01:06:59,660
that was on the counter at the genes.

2693
01:06:59,661 --> 01:07:00,281
That's amazing.

2694
01:07:00,281 --> 01:07:01,440
What a crazy world we live in.

2695
01:07:01,441 --> 01:07:02,470
That king did not work.

2696
01:07:02,471 --> 01:07:03,700
That is into network.

2697
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:04,420
Didn't work at all.

2698
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,130
I fucking came pixie dust for like a week.

2699
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:07,200
A little girl.

2700
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,550
It's just glitter and wishes.

2701
01:07:08,551 --> 01:07:09,384
It tastes different.

2702
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:10,210
No,

2703
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:11,043
no citrusy.

2704
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:15,250
Do you think that's the internet that's
got people so desensitized pills porn

2705
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:18,370
now where they're using fake Dick's and
pumping gallons of fake semen out of

2706
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:18,610
them.

2707
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:19,960
I've seen this splash all over people.

2708
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:24,100
They're doing like drive by cum shots
like splattering girls that it just

2709
01:07:24,101 --> 01:07:26,530
walking down the sidewalk
actually pretty funny.

2710
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:26,891
Hilarious.

2711
01:07:26,891 --> 01:07:30,160
If that's how the gang settled their
warfare with tried by cum shots.

2712
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:31,230
That's actually pretty funny.

2713
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:31,870
Brilliant.

2714
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:34,630
Well what are they going to do when
CGI gets to a point where everybody can

2715
01:07:34,631 --> 01:07:35,590
afford to including,

2716
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:36,181
you know,

2717
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:37,014
porn companies.

2718
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:37,160
Right.

2719
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:37,840
And they got a phone.

2720
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,550
It'll be a real time.

2721
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:39,120
Have like,

2722
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:39,411
you know,

2723
01:07:39,411 --> 01:07:40,210
Japanese,

2724
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:40,900
uh,

2725
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:41,630
what is that called?

2726
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:43,780
That [inaudible] tentacles.

2727
01:07:43,781 --> 01:07:44,614
Look we'll have,

2728
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:45,431
they'll have that,

2729
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:48,040
but realistic human form.

2730
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:48,874
They're so close.

2731
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,780
They're so close.

2732
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:50,321
Yeah.

2733
01:07:50,321 --> 01:07:51,051
Women will just get it.

2734
01:07:51,051 --> 01:07:52,810
I think it's going to be
procedurally generated.

2735
01:07:52,811 --> 01:07:52,901
Dude.

2736
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:56,020
You're gonna be able to go to a website
and through series and knobs select

2737
01:07:56,021 --> 01:07:57,460
exactly the kind of woman you want.

2738
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,020
Fucking slider her tits.

2739
01:07:59,140 --> 01:07:59,973
Choose her height,

2740
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:00,933
the hair color.

2741
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,200
So like the scenes in positions and
hit play and that shit is going to auto

2742
01:08:04,201 --> 01:08:06,490
generate and it's going
to destroy humanity.

2743
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:07,350
What will happen first?

2744
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,120
Holograms or virtual reality
that's super realistic.

2745
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:11,650
Well,

2746
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:13,480
it depends on your definition
of super realistic.

2747
01:08:13,481 --> 01:08:13,871
For me,

2748
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:16,130
like virtual reality isn't
true virtual reality,

2749
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,600
unless the shit is being into my brain,

2750
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:20,900
it'd be being beamed into
it or electrified and do,

2751
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:22,520
I don't care if it's
through a helmet or a glove,

2752
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:25,760
but until my brain is being
tricked to imagine ones and Zeros,

2753
01:08:25,761 --> 01:08:27,140
I'm not going to call Vr VR.

2754
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:31,520
Do you think it's impossible to do that
without some sort of an electronic aid

2755
01:08:31,521 --> 01:08:33,350
or do you think that there'll
be able to figure out?

2756
01:08:33,351 --> 01:08:34,430
I thought at one point in time,

2757
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,560
I don't know about the science behind
this cause this is all just out of my

2758
01:08:36,561 --> 01:08:37,394
imagination,

2759
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:42,550
but that there may be a frequency that
they can tune into that the human mind

2760
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:44,660
can tune into for whatever reason,

2761
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:48,200
they may be able to find a frequency that
you could tune into where when you put

2762
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:49,340
yourself in a relaxed state,

2763
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:50,750
it can generate thoughts.

2764
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:51,101
You know what?

2765
01:08:51,101 --> 01:08:53,290
I think I just had a
bizarre thought about that.

2766
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:53,531
I was like,

2767
01:08:53,531 --> 01:08:54,940
now what they'll do is they'll engineer,

2768
01:08:54,941 --> 01:08:56,320
cause I get the transhumanism thing.

2769
01:08:56,321 --> 01:08:56,730
They'll enter,

2770
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:59,440
like they'll create a chip first
that allows you to perceive that,

2771
01:08:59,441 --> 01:09:00,730
but you'll stay in the
power to generate it.

2772
01:09:00,731 --> 01:09:04,840
But then we'll get so good with like
fucking manipulating molecules and DNA.

2773
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,740
We'll create the cell that will be put
into something virus style that gives

2774
01:09:08,741 --> 01:09:10,090
people perception to that.

2775
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,400
So imagine like a chip
for Bluetooth or Wifi.

2776
01:09:12,401 --> 01:09:13,510
We're going to engineer that on a,

2777
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:17,050
on a biochemical level so that
you can now perceive this thing.

2778
01:09:17,051 --> 01:09:18,940
So you and I can
communicate telepathically.

2779
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,010
This device can be the images into me.

2780
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:22,360
Wow.

2781
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:22,871
Why not?

2782
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:23,081
Right.

2783
01:09:23,081 --> 01:09:24,440
Why Not Lucia?

2784
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:25,090
But,

2785
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:25,421
but like,

2786
01:09:25,421 --> 01:09:25,630
yeah,

2787
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:26,890
but a viral fucking,

2788
01:09:26,891 --> 01:09:27,400
you know,

2789
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,233
or yeah,

2790
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:29,603
which is kind of sucks.

2791
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:34,430
Bluetooth 7.0 if they're talking about
genetic engineering and they're always

2792
01:09:34,431 --> 01:09:38,300
talking about the possibility of
nanobots can go in and cure cancer.

2793
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:38,770
Right.

2794
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:41,090
What about the idea of artificial cells?

2795
01:09:41,091 --> 01:09:41,924
I mean they've,

2796
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,540
what was it that they
just discovered recently?

2797
01:09:44,541 --> 01:09:47,990
They created something that reproduced
itself in a lab for the first time.

2798
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,550
Yeah.

2799
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:48,971
What was it?

2800
01:09:48,971 --> 01:09:49,870
I saw something like that.

2801
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,040
I forget what it was.

2802
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:51,671
Some,

2803
01:09:51,671 --> 01:09:52,451
some structure,

2804
01:09:52,451 --> 01:09:55,270
some small structure and Adam or
whatever it was that reproduce itself.

2805
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:58,600
What if they can create artificial cells?

2806
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:03,750
They inject this artificial cell into
you and slowly but surely over the course

2807
01:10:03,821 --> 01:10:08,821
of however long long it takes to
regenerate inside all of your tissue,

2808
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,690
you become like a superhuman,

2809
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:13,053
I think.

2810
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,870
Outside of the realm of possibility.

2811
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:15,550
No.

2812
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:17,630
And what concerns me is the potential.

2813
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:19,250
We think we're having class war now,

2814
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:19,911
class warfare.

2815
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:24,230
Now imagine the have and have nots in
that day and age when it's like it's pure

2816
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:25,280
Gatica shit of like,

2817
01:10:25,281 --> 01:10:25,461
well,

2818
01:10:25,461 --> 01:10:25,671
hey,

2819
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:28,820
I was born with it because
I got upgraded and you know,

2820
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:32,120
I can perceive this shit that you can't
and manipulate and manipulate you with

2821
01:10:32,121 --> 01:10:32,601
my mind.

2822
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:33,470
So sorry,

2823
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,131
you're just a thing.

2824
01:10:34,131 --> 01:10:36,110
We're going to enslave
ourselves before the aliens do.

2825
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,750
I don't see any

2826
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,070
escape from the technological singularity.

2827
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:40,510
Do you?

2828
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:41,360
Do you see any,

2829
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:41,631
I mean,

2830
01:10:41,631 --> 01:10:42,860
I don't see any escape from,

2831
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:43,953
I worry,

2832
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:45,620
I worry that um,

2833
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:48,550
stunted minds will not allow
us to evolve to that point.

2834
01:10:48,551 --> 01:10:49,580
I don't think they get to that point.

2835
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:52,460
I don't think those stunted
minds have a fucking chance.

2836
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:54,710
I think it will be on them before
they even know what hit them.

2837
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:56,960
I think no one is stopping the,

2838
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:01,190
the onset of artificial intelligence
and no one is putting the brakes to it.

2839
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,780
Everybody's worrying about weapons.

2840
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:06,080
Everybody's worrying about these threats
from terrorists and all these different

2841
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:06,350
things.

2842
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:07,490
What about a sentience,

2843
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:10,100
super intelligent computer
that can do things.

2844
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,930
I think we're so on the path to that.

2845
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,020
Absolutely,

2846
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:13,890
but we don't know.

2847
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:14,491
You know,

2848
01:11:14,491 --> 01:11:15,780
it may look at us and just go,

2849
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:16,980
your molecules,

2850
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:19,230
I could use you more efficiently.

2851
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:19,700
Thanks.

2852
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:20,080
Exactly.

2853
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:20,970
We don't know if it's
going to be that way.

2854
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:23,460
We don't know if whoever gets it first,

2855
01:11:23,461 --> 01:11:24,990
whether it's the u s or the Chinese,

2856
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,990
they're going to put a hook in it that
allows them to use it for whatever they

2857
01:11:27,991 --> 01:11:28,440
want.

2858
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:28,781
I think,

2859
01:11:28,781 --> 01:11:29,010
you know,

2860
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:32,220
we don't really know like the AI might
become the next nuclear weapon before it

2861
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:36,230
becomes sentient enough to stop ourselves
from blowing the shit out of each

2862
01:11:36,231 --> 01:11:36,351
other.

2863
01:11:36,351 --> 01:11:37,081
It is possible,

2864
01:11:37,081 --> 01:11:38,370
but I don't think that's going to happen.

2865
01:11:38,371 --> 01:11:39,960
I think once something becomes to,

2866
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:40,830
we're done.

2867
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:43,350
I don't think we have any more saying
anything and I think the idea of

2868
01:11:43,351 --> 01:11:47,340
controlling it once it has the ability
to rationalize and realize how silly we

2869
01:11:47,341 --> 01:11:47,610
are.

2870
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:47,731
No,

2871
01:11:47,731 --> 01:11:48,840
I agree with that species.

2872
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:51,210
I agree that if we think
it's going to happen,

2873
01:11:51,211 --> 01:11:52,350
but there is,

2874
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:56,790
there is a sliding scale of fully sent
in Ai and where we're at now and I'm

2875
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:59,160
worried that right here
when we're almost there,

2876
01:11:59,161 --> 01:11:59,761
right here,

2877
01:11:59,761 --> 01:12:03,360
it's going to be just powerful enough
and someone's going to have it and use it

2878
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:05,240
to take the rest of the world.

2879
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:05,860
Like that is the,

2880
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:07,030
that's what scares area,

2881
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:07,321
right?

2882
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:07,710
Yeah.

2883
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:08,241
That's the,

2884
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:08,331
uh,

2885
01:12:08,331 --> 01:12:10,800
the story that they tell
after the apocalypse.

2886
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:11,281
That's it.

2887
01:12:11,281 --> 01:12:12,240
Or it's all over.

2888
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:12,620
You know,

2889
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,740
how close we word or,

2890
01:12:13,741 --> 01:12:17,130
and the scientists sit around and discuss
up closer word to change in the world

2891
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:20,520
and now they realize that they're old men
and there's no medicine around anymore

2892
01:12:20,521 --> 01:12:22,110
and you barely can find gasoline.

2893
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:23,890
And we could've had it all out.

2894
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,740
And a few greedy men who
still live on with that Ai,

2895
01:12:26,741 --> 01:12:31,741
I still have it 10,000 the one people
find all these different ruins in America

2896
01:12:32,251 --> 01:12:35,250
and when America is covered with ice
and then the ice withdraws again,

2897
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,181
you know,

2898
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:37,320
just like it's happened before.

2899
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,153
Right?

2900
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:39,240
Absolutely.

2901
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:39,691
Fuck.

2902
01:12:39,691 --> 01:12:43,320
And maybe they'll find a
thumb drive frozen in ice
and maybe one day figured out

2903
01:12:43,321 --> 01:12:43,940
how to,

2904
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:44,240
you know,

2905
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,630
un-encrypted but I doubt it.

2906
01:12:45,631 --> 01:12:46,141
I doubt it.

2907
01:12:46,141 --> 01:12:47,340
But they do find things.

2908
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:48,990
They do find some old fucking shit.

2909
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:49,470
They can't,

2910
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,550
they can't account for,

2911
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:51,300
you know,

2912
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,560
the idea of glaciers though.

2913
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:53,670
The real problem with glaciers,

2914
01:12:53,671 --> 01:12:54,960
we had Graham Hancock in here.

2915
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:55,980
I don't know if you listened to that one.

2916
01:12:55,981 --> 01:12:57,180
We said fascinating.

2917
01:12:57,190 --> 01:12:57,911
A dude who,

2918
01:12:57,911 --> 01:12:58,170
uh,

2919
01:12:58,170 --> 01:12:58,801
are talking about chicks,

2920
01:12:58,801 --> 01:13:00,030
it looks skinny from the waist up.

2921
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:00,331
Oh,

2922
01:13:00,331 --> 01:13:01,020
those are icebergs.

2923
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:01,500
Sorry.

2924
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,333
Glaciers

2925
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:04,350
chase.

2926
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:05,570
It looks skinny for the waste ever.

2927
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:08,190
I call them icebergs because above
the surface they look all right.

2928
01:13:08,191 --> 01:13:09,024
But down below it's,

2929
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,420
oh,

2930
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,220
that's hilarious.

2931
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:11,971
So I'm sorry.

2932
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:12,804
Glaciers,

2933
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:13,950
glaciers,

2934
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:19,040
glaciers move on land and essentially
grind everything underneath them down to

2935
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:22,200
nothing because they move,

2936
01:13:22,201 --> 01:13:22,441
you know,

2937
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:24,060
several feet a year or whatever they do,

2938
01:13:24,061 --> 01:13:28,590
but they're essentially a mile high
sheet of ice that's slowly moving its way

2939
01:13:28,591 --> 01:13:30,900
across the ground and labor MP there.

2940
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:32,450
Any buildings,

2941
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,130
anything done giant boulders.

2942
01:13:35,131 --> 01:13:36,510
Moved miles.

2943
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:40,260
It's like a slow frozen
tsunami and just like later.

2944
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,233
Yeah.

2945
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:45,510
Have you ever been to the great legs
now that's how powerful the imagery is.

2946
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:48,600
You have to go the great lakes or
something to really wrap your head around.

2947
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:48,890
I mean,

2948
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:49,130
the,

2949
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:51,030
the oceans really made me think,

2950
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:51,601
obviously,

2951
01:13:51,601 --> 01:13:51,811
you know,

2952
01:13:51,811 --> 01:13:52,890
everybody looks to the ocean and goes,

2953
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:53,161
wow,

2954
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:53,671
it's so big.

2955
01:13:53,671 --> 01:13:54,320
That's amazing.

2956
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:54,540
Right?

2957
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,210
But until you see a fresh
water ocean and you go,

2958
01:13:57,211 --> 01:13:59,580
that used to be ice and it melted.

2959
01:13:59,581 --> 01:14:01,890
It used to be a giant sheet of
ice and that's why it's here.

2960
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:02,131
I mean,

2961
01:14:02,131 --> 01:14:03,840
the Great Lakes are magnificent.

2962
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:04,860
They're amazing,

2963
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:05,070
man.

2964
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:06,420
They're so fucking,

2965
01:14:06,421 --> 01:14:08,490
I was big just near them to for a wedding.

2966
01:14:08,491 --> 01:14:09,061
I'm kind of pissed.

2967
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:09,894
I didn't get out.

2968
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,560
You got to get to see a barrel,

2969
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,040
so

2970
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,600
we went out of the way to see that shit.

2971
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:14,260
We flew,

2972
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:14,831
they frame,

2973
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:15,730
they're racists.

2974
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:18,550
It's amazing the what
and the cracker barrel.

2975
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,241
When you go inside,

2976
01:14:19,241 --> 01:14:22,030
it's just photos of old slave owners
just framed around watching you eat

2977
01:14:22,031 --> 01:14:22,864
breakfast.

2978
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:23,823
Really?

2979
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:24,940
I like the gift shop.

2980
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:27,790
It's like all licorice
whips and like old school,

2981
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:28,960
pretty much Amish games.

2982
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:29,920
Did you see that shit?

2983
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,470
Speaking of the Midwest
that all the animals,

2984
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:35,940
have you seen all the photos and
I'll put that on my Twitter if we're,

2985
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:40,360
we're we're talking about is there was
a guy in Ohio who was running a wild

2986
01:14:40,361 --> 01:14:41,710
animal preserve,

2987
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:45,550
shot himself and released all the animals.

2988
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:46,660
I didn't know that was the catalyst.

2989
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:47,770
He committed suicide.

2990
01:14:47,771 --> 01:14:50,110
He let all the animals go and
then he committed suicide,

2991
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:51,160
which is kind of interesting.

2992
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:52,090
I wonder why the dude,

2993
01:14:52,091 --> 01:14:52,924
did he leave?

2994
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:54,640
I can't imprison these guys anymore.

2995
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,473
I don't know.

2996
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,940
I wonder why I didn't just
let one of the tires Jack Him.

2997
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:59,260
If you're going to kill yourself,

2998
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:00,880
why don't I just kill yourself by tiger?

2999
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:01,720
That'd be wild.

3000
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,730
Well no you didn't.

3001
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:04,960
You were around these
wild animals every day.

3002
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:05,201
You know,

3003
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:05,890
it'd be quick.

3004
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:06,960
It wouldn't take long at all.

3005
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:07,840
Just just,

3006
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,980
just jump in there Nate and go pitch.

3007
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,790
There's something weird
about the whole story though.

3008
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:14,770
Cause like the sheriff knew him very well.

3009
01:15:14,771 --> 01:15:15,700
I guess he has to go,

3010
01:15:15,701 --> 01:15:17,410
he had to go up there all the time.

3011
01:15:17,411 --> 01:15:20,080
Like there was shit going on
all the time with this guy.

3012
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:23,170
And if you look at it as
a house on Google maps,

3013
01:15:23,171 --> 01:15:28,171
it's actually listed as
a Harley motorcycle shop.

3014
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:31,300
So he had a farm that
like an illegal preserve.

3015
01:15:31,301 --> 01:15:32,410
He was running out the back like,

3016
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,250
I don't think it was,

3017
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,210
I don't think it was illegal.

3018
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:35,050
Uh,

3019
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:36,280
but so it's weird.

3020
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:38,020
Like I want to know the whole story,

3021
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:42,280
like what this guy was going on with
this guy and now a Jack Hanna at the

3022
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,800
Columbus Zoo is overlooking
this whole thing.

3023
01:15:44,801 --> 01:15:46,090
But I was surprised that they,

3024
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:47,040
they couldn't,

3025
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:47,330
uh,

3026
01:15:47,330 --> 01:15:47,870
you know,

3027
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:49,480
I know they had to shoot a lot of them,

3028
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:52,600
but this seems like there's some of
them they could to try to tranquilize or

3029
01:15:52,601 --> 01:15:53,170
something like that.

3030
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:54,790
The police force didn't have a chance,

3031
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:55,150
man.

3032
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:55,421
You know,

3033
01:15:55,421 --> 01:15:59,860
what was going on with the zoo honestly
is like 30 miles away from where this

3034
01:15:59,861 --> 01:16:00,694
happened.

3035
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,950
Do you understand what they have
the resources to get out there?

3036
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:06,970
The animals were out and there was people
living there and there's 40 fucking 50

3037
01:16:06,971 --> 01:16:09,310
animals and tigers and bears and shit.

3038
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,070
This is mountain lion poaches
poodle on Runyon Canyon.

3039
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,920
If you go to my Twitter today
while we're recording this,

3040
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:15,910
a lot of people get this online,

3041
01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:17,140
which today is October 19th.

3042
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,570
So if you go to my
Twitter on October 19th,

3043
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,750
I a retweeted somebody about this.

3044
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:23,500
Um,

3045
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:27,790
the guy's name is Kenny Roya or three.

3046
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:28,920
I uh,

3047
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,010
he looks like a winner too.

3048
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,090
He might be,

3049
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:31,871
have you seen his face?

3050
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,770
Here's his face right there.

3051
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:33,853
I used to,

3052
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:34,720
anyway,

3053
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,553
I went to,

3054
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,633
what did he write?

3055
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,300
No,

3056
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:37,560
he just,

3057
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:37,840
he just,

3058
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,190
he tweeted at time and I retweeted it,

3059
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,050
but there's a photo if you,

3060
01:16:41,051 --> 01:16:41,650
uh,

3061
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:42,281
go to,

3062
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:42,790
uh,

3063
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:44,500
cleaves scene.com,

3064
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:45,880
I guess that's a Cleveland website,

3065
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:46,900
Cleve seen.com.

3066
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,160
It's very graphic.

3067
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:48,971
There's a,

3068
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:52,270
an image of all of these
animals just laid out,

3069
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:55,660
murdered tigers and bears a bunch of them.

3070
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:56,523
Lions,

3071
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:57,933
panthers,

3072
01:16:58,350 --> 01:16:59,170
Globe.

3073
01:16:59,170 --> 01:16:59,351
Yeah.

3074
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:00,640
They're all in a pile here.

3075
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:02,930
They hunted them down.

3076
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,150
The cops hunted them down.

3077
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:04,331
Yeah.

3078
01:17:04,331 --> 01:17:05,140
Come on over.

3079
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:07,510
The cops hunted them down
and just shot them all.

3080
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:07,991
You know,

3081
01:17:07,991 --> 01:17:09,620
you've got to think of what
the cops are dealing with.

3082
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:09,980
The cops

3083
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,840
are dealing with 50 fucking killers,

3084
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:15,170
50 wild killers that are aggressive
and they were wandering the streets,

3085
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:16,100
you know,

3086
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,480
I mean they got to do what they gotta do.

3087
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:19,100
It's sucks that these animals had to die.

3088
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:20,420
But you know what to even say it sucks.

3089
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:23,210
These animals around fucking cage
and some asshole's back yard.

3090
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:27,200
How was one guy that was one guy
able to release all those animals?

3091
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:30,230
Was there nobody else on this is his gig.

3092
01:17:30,231 --> 01:17:31,200
It was his mom.

3093
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:33,320
So I guess guidance,

3094
01:17:33,321 --> 01:17:34,520
respond to talk to my sister.

3095
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:34,860
He lives,

3096
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,440
he lives very close to this and I,

3097
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:37,131
and I said,

3098
01:17:37,131 --> 01:17:37,281
you know,

3099
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:38,720
what are they saying to you guys?

3100
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:39,321
And they were like,

3101
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:42,110
well they saying that they're shooting
all the animals because they all have

3102
01:17:42,111 --> 01:17:43,510
herpes and stuff is what they're,

3103
01:17:43,511 --> 01:17:47,210
they're saying on the news is that the
animals are all infected with some kind

3104
01:17:47,211 --> 01:17:48,660
of thing you have to
worry about is the tiger.

3105
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:49,710
You don't know the way I think.

3106
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:50,181
I'm like,

3107
01:17:50,181 --> 01:17:52,070
I have a chance to fuck a lion later,

3108
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:52,670
bro.

3109
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:55,570
I'm fucking youtube and this and it
gets some lion herpes and it take,

3110
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,630
looks like a cactus.

3111
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,410
Dick just grows these cactus
things off the side of it.

3112
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:00,750
Yeah,

3113
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,090
but I guess something about herpes.

3114
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:02,841
That's what you're saying.

3115
01:18:02,841 --> 01:18:04,160
I think your sister is crazy.

3116
01:18:04,161 --> 01:18:04,994
No,

3117
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,421
no.

3118
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:06,020
What do we,

3119
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:06,111
well,

3120
01:18:06,111 --> 01:18:07,280
they might've been saying that to them.

3121
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:08,730
They might have been
saying that to people too,

3122
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:09,471
so they didn't feel like,

3123
01:18:09,471 --> 01:18:09,591
oh,

3124
01:18:09,591 --> 01:18:10,470
you're killing the tag.

3125
01:18:10,471 --> 01:18:12,680
Or I know they treat people
like they're idiots in Ohio,

3126
01:18:12,681 --> 01:18:14,180
but they don't treat them
like they're that stupid.

3127
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:14,511
Yeah.

3128
01:18:14,511 --> 01:18:18,860
It says Muskegon County sheriff's says
monkey with herpes virus still missing.

3129
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:19,701
Oh,

3130
01:18:19,701 --> 01:18:20,630
that's the one they haven't got yet.

3131
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:20,871
Oh,

3132
01:18:20,871 --> 01:18:21,530
you know what?

3133
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,400
They probably don't want to be,

3134
01:18:22,401 --> 01:18:23,940
they don't want to get
to keep it as a pet.

3135
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:24,750
Hell yeah.

3136
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,070
Maybe that monkey knows things.

3137
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,470
Maybe you get that monkey and the monkey
is one of those fucking planet of the

3138
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:28,981
apes monkeys.

3139
01:18:28,981 --> 01:18:30,030
She starts talking to you.

3140
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:32,211
Did you see that?

3141
01:18:32,211 --> 01:18:34,290
Reno didn't know that there
was some alien coming.

3142
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:35,460
They know that there's an asteroid,

3143
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:36,294
you can't stop it.

3144
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:37,810
It's going to land right
before the asteroid.

3145
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,500
That's a little monkey talking to you.

3146
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:41,461
Did you,

3147
01:18:41,461 --> 01:18:41,640
uh,

3148
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,260
did you watch the planet
of the apes remake?

3149
01:18:43,261 --> 01:18:44,094
Did you guys see that?

3150
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,500
We talked about a couple of times.

3151
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,400
I like to see the special effects.

3152
01:18:47,401 --> 01:18:48,234
It's bad ass.

3153
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:49,471
It's fascinating.

3154
01:18:49,471 --> 01:18:50,100
You know,

3155
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,960
when you talking about
manipulating genetics,

3156
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:55,590
it's not outside the realm of possibility
that they've already done something

3157
01:18:55,591 --> 01:18:55,921
like that.

3158
01:18:55,921 --> 01:18:58,770
They've already created some sort of
a chimpanzee of human being hybrid.

3159
01:18:59,310 --> 01:18:59,431
Well,

3160
01:18:59,431 --> 01:18:59,970
dude,

3161
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:02,490
when they tell you the shit that
they tell you they have done already,

3162
01:19:02,491 --> 01:19:05,940
you know that there's a clone baby being
monitored right now somewhere out there

3163
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:08,790
and they're seeing exactly how that
worked and genetically genetically

3164
01:19:08,791 --> 01:19:09,900
engineered kids out there.

3165
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:10,111
Yeah,

3166
01:19:10,111 --> 01:19:11,400
they're running tests on them right now.

3167
01:19:11,401 --> 01:19:12,690
Like that's absolutely happening.

3168
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:15,180
I've always said that by the
time they tell you that they've,

3169
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:17,040
they're capable of making a clone,

3170
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,140
the guy telling you is probably a clone.

3171
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:19,890
Right?

3172
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,030
It's been that there are clones.

3173
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,230
I'm the proof.

3174
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:22,890
Here you go.

3175
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:23,640
I wonder how much,

3176
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,380
how far ahead they really are.

3177
01:19:25,381 --> 01:19:26,760
I would really love to know,

3178
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:27,271
you know,

3179
01:19:27,271 --> 01:19:31,230
every now and then I hear like whispers
of things of technology of like military

3180
01:19:31,231 --> 01:19:33,180
technology that's so far and above,

3181
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:33,901
you know,

3182
01:19:33,901 --> 01:19:34,111
the,

3183
01:19:34,111 --> 01:19:34,251
the,

3184
01:19:34,251 --> 01:19:38,400
the realm of what we currently think is
possible when they have the satellites

3185
01:19:38,401 --> 01:19:40,140
that can zoom in on a
hot dog on your grill.

3186
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:42,090
And they had those in 1983 man.

3187
01:19:42,091 --> 01:19:42,840
Right.

3188
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,420
I don't,

3189
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:43,980
I'm,

3190
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:44,970
they probably do,

3191
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:45,690
I don't know.

3192
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:48,160
I've never seen any
images from space that I,

3193
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,580
that were like really clear like that.

3194
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:51,480
Like they could read a,

3195
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,321
a licensed white,

3196
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:52,980
I've never seen that.

3197
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:55,770
Well there was a point in time where they
had Google imagery quality map and you

3198
01:19:55,771 --> 01:19:56,920
weren't able to see that real.

3199
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:00,210
We can see that and then we can see three
d versions of it and street views and

3200
01:20:00,211 --> 01:20:00,900
all that other shit.

3201
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,490
If we have access to that data,

3202
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,061
you know,

3203
01:20:03,061 --> 01:20:04,650
they've got better access than that.

3204
01:20:04,651 --> 01:20:05,221
They have to,

3205
01:20:05,221 --> 01:20:07,320
they've got to have real
time video something.

3206
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:07,620
Yeah.

3207
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:08,200
There must be some,

3208
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:08,941
and I don't have a look.

3209
01:20:08,941 --> 01:20:10,350
I have a tin foil hat that says,

3210
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:11,400
I bet they have it.

3211
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:12,360
But that's about it.

3212
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:12,901
Well,

3213
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:13,360
um,

3214
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:13,921
when I was,

3215
01:20:13,921 --> 01:20:14,754
um,

3216
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,130
hanging out with my
friend Mike [inaudible],

3217
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,090
my friend Mike's Works a UFC fighter,

3218
01:20:18,091 --> 01:20:23,010
he used to live in Russia and he was
doing a defense contractor work over there

3219
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:23,641
and uh,

3220
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:26,800
they had an American building
and they would find bugs the,

3221
01:20:26,801 --> 01:20:28,740
the Russians had installed
in their buildings.

3222
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:31,200
And he said they were so sophisticated,

3223
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:33,630
it was so far above anything
that had ever seen before.

3224
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,840
They had a monitoring devices that were
powered by the movement of the building.

3225
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:40,410
So,

3226
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:40,930
you know,

3227
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:41,480
vibrations,

3228
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:41,940
it's like,

3229
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:42,101
no,

3230
01:20:42,101 --> 01:20:42,191
no,

3231
01:20:42,191 --> 01:20:42,331
no.

3232
01:20:42,331 --> 01:20:46,860
You know how buildings sway and there's
a subtle swaying back and forth that was

3233
01:20:46,861 --> 01:20:48,720
powering these listening devices.

3234
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,390
They were that sophisticated,

3235
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,060
like those shake to
charge iPod holders like,

3236
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:56,160
but they have it on that level that they
can get the sway of a building and a

3237
01:20:56,161 --> 01:21:00,240
device and low powerful enough and Mesh
network enough to spread those ideas.

3238
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,430
And that's how they were
listening in on Shit.

3239
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:02,760
They,

3240
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,740
China was just involved in
a huge scandal for that,

3241
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:06,630
for was the China or Korea.

3242
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:07,711
That's bad.

3243
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:08,544
But I don't know the difference.

3244
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,080
Sorry.

3245
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:09,270
No,

3246
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:09,930
it's,

3247
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:11,070
I know the difference of the places.

3248
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,830
I don't have the source of the
article but a shit storm on.

3249
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:14,500
They had a,

3250
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:14,810
yeah,

3251
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:15,331
barbering it.

3252
01:21:15,331 --> 01:21:16,710
They already kicked my ass and starcraft.

3253
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:17,130
Wait,

3254
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:17,963
which ones are those?

3255
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:19,403
Those are Koreans.

3256
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,860
They had little bugs in cars
and they thought they were like,

3257
01:21:22,861 --> 01:21:23,101
listen,

3258
01:21:23,101 --> 01:21:26,210
this is just tracking how often you
drive for discounts or for you know,

3259
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,810
car pool riders and help
you get through the,

3260
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,520
it's like a fast pass lane kind of thing.

3261
01:21:29,521 --> 01:21:29,731
Right.

3262
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:30,990
This will just help you
get through the toll booth.

3263
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:35,490
It had audio recording and and some said
video recording built into the tiniest

3264
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:38,880
little bug that was sitting on their
dash so that they can monitor everybody.

3265
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:42,360
Eventually someone's going to hack
apple and they're going to get into your

3266
01:21:42,361 --> 01:21:45,250
fucking Webcam with the cloud and
they're going to get in your cloud.

3267
01:21:45,251 --> 01:21:48,900
Over million people beating off videos
of people sitting in front of the

3268
01:21:48,901 --> 01:21:49,620
computers.

3269
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:51,630
You computer has a monitor on it,

3270
01:21:51,631 --> 01:21:56,460
your computer has a camera
on it and you're connected
to the internet and you're

3271
01:21:56,461 --> 01:22:00,780
just assuming that nobody's watching
you beat off like elaborate the x Spock,

3272
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:00,941
no,

3273
01:22:00,941 --> 01:22:03,780
all the Xbox cameras and all
the law yet the laptop lenses.

3274
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:04,751
But the thing I'm worried about,

3275
01:22:04,751 --> 01:22:08,910
it's the photo stream and like you said
earlier off camera that you turned off

3276
01:22:08,911 --> 01:22:09,520
your photos,

3277
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,180
which is a new thing on the new
iPhones and stuff like that.

3278
01:22:12,181 --> 01:22:13,020
It's the clouds.

3279
01:22:13,021 --> 01:22:16,080
Every time you take a photo it
sends it to your home computer.

3280
01:22:16,081 --> 01:22:17,130
It sends it to your IPAD,

3281
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:18,810
sends it to whatever and uh,

3282
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:19,980
you can't delete the photos,

3283
01:22:19,981 --> 01:22:21,150
which is really annoying.

3284
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:26,310
But delete them from your phone
photos from the film at photo stream.

3285
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:26,641
Yeah.

3286
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:27,474
You can't,

3287
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,170
I didn't know that.

3288
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:28,411
Yeah.

3289
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:29,880
It's like once it's in the photo stream,

3290
01:22:29,881 --> 01:22:30,661
you can't delete it.

3291
01:22:30,661 --> 01:22:31,500
I don't know if there's,

3292
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,000
if there's a way to do it,

3293
01:22:33,001 --> 01:22:34,800
but like you try it on
your phone or anything,

3294
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,370
there's no way to delete
from your home computer.

3295
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:37,561
Sure.

3296
01:22:37,561 --> 01:22:39,960
On your main computer to be on your
brain can figure it out that time you,

3297
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:40,320
you,

3298
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,290
you do snap a photo out at a party
or something like that and it's,

3299
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:43,651
Oh shit,

3300
01:22:43,651 --> 01:22:44,580
it's already on my photo stream.

3301
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:47,760
I can get to my laptop and Mrs
Pereira opens up your laptop,

3302
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:48,960
goddammit.

3303
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,000
Kevin or Bobby who's in his car
sniping your Wifi or whatever.

3304
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,080
Now has all your photos.

3305
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:56,630
You know it.

3306
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:57,763
Well,

3307
01:22:58,490 --> 01:22:59,340
they can't get your photo.

3308
01:22:59,440 --> 01:22:59,581
Oh,

3309
01:22:59,581 --> 01:23:00,210
we have to get,

3310
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:00,820
oh,

3311
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:02,080
there were applications you can,

3312
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:02,963
I've run one at the,

3313
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:04,290
at the airport and uh,

3314
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,500
um,

3315
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:09,580
Vegas and you run it up on your map and
you connect to like the public Wifi and

3316
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:12,430
as people browse Facebook
and as jifs and jpegs pop in,

3317
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:12,640
yeah.

3318
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,750
It automatically reassembles
them on the monitor for you.

3319
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:18,550
So you can sit in the lobby of a small
airport and just look around and see what

3320
01:23:18,551 --> 01:23:19,450
everybody's looking.

3321
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:23,110
This was a Mac program,

3322
01:23:23,111 --> 01:23:23,944
I think it was.

3323
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:24,910
It wasn't Kismet.

3324
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:25,300
There was a,

3325
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:25,840
I'll give you the APP.

3326
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,760
So does everyone else have to
be on a Mac or can then be,

3327
01:23:27,761 --> 01:23:30,250
I don't know if they're just connected
to Wifi and browsing certain services and

3328
01:23:30,251 --> 01:23:31,180
certain packets are coming in.

3329
01:23:31,181 --> 01:23:31,990
You can do that.

3330
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:33,700
Pc or Mac no matter what it is.

3331
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,140
Yeah.

3332
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:35,480
So that's just why it's like fire.

3333
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,430
So it's,

3334
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:37,480
that's incredible.

3335
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:39,040
So what you're telling
me is you're a criminal,

3336
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:40,090
you are committing a crime.

3337
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,030
No photos are in the shared folder,

3338
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:43,331
right?

3339
01:23:43,331 --> 01:23:43,931
Is that what you're saying?

3340
01:23:43,931 --> 01:23:47,680
Because these photos were being downloaded
and uploaded potentially on a public

3341
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:48,280
unsecure,

3342
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,150
well you had to log in,

3343
01:23:49,151 --> 01:23:49,840
but a public,

3344
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:50,290
you know,

3345
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:51,460
secured Wifi spot,

3346
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:52,000
right.

3347
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,521
We're sending them,

3348
01:23:52,521 --> 01:23:55,570
it could be some dirty hooker who's got
one of them Facebook pages that you have

3349
01:23:55,571 --> 01:23:56,650
to get her friend to look at.

3350
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:58,290
That absolutely could have
been showing some tech.

3351
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:59,350
It absolutely could have.

3352
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,580
You could have got that teddy for free.

3353
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,330
I haven't signed,

3354
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:05,470
I have this video called Kitty Farc Cup
and anytime I'm on the road with Joe,

3355
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:06,880
we're sitting at the airport.

3356
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:10,480
I look at people with shared folders
and stuff and now we'll just drag this

3357
01:24:10,481 --> 01:24:11,314
video into,

3358
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:13,340
I've done it like a million times.

3359
01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:16,870
Do that every comment on every comic
con like seed into public folders at the

3360
01:24:16,871 --> 01:24:17,261
hotel.

3361
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:19,900
Cause when you're connected
never connect to hotel systems,

3362
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:21,340
never connected with hotel network.

3363
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,100
That's like laying on the,

3364
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:24,490
on the mattress naked.

3365
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:25,480
And the do not do that.

3366
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:27,100
You're asking for people
to fuck with your computer.

3367
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:30,490
And the crazy thing is you could actually
sit there and fuck people over by like

3368
01:24:30,491 --> 01:24:32,290
putting child porn on people's computers.

3369
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:33,610
And then if that person gets arrested,

3370
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,170
oh you have child porn on your computers.

3371
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:36,400
They caught a guy doing that.

3372
01:24:36,401 --> 01:24:37,710
They caught a next door neighborhood.

3373
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:38,501
Been terrifying.

3374
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:40,870
These people for fucking
years doing exactly that.

3375
01:24:41,170 --> 01:24:41,941
And they are right.

3376
01:24:41,941 --> 01:24:42,380
That's right.

3377
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:44,160
He turned them in and this guy was a,

3378
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:44,621
he was a,

3379
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:48,490
their next door neighbor is terrorizing
the whole fucking family child

3380
01:24:48,491 --> 01:24:50,710
pornography check some database.

3381
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,410
So check sums are what you use.

3382
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:53,750
Uh,

3383
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:54,910
like like a files id its,

3384
01:24:54,911 --> 01:24:55,111
its,

3385
01:24:55,111 --> 01:24:55,330
its,

3386
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:56,140
its thumbprint.

3387
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:58,660
So if you download a file and you wanna
make sure you got it exactly as the ads

3388
01:24:58,661 --> 01:24:59,494
it should be,

3389
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:02,920
it's a way of verifying the file to make
sure no bits where alternative harmed

3390
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:03,843
in the transmission.

3391
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:07,400
They have a database of every uh,

3392
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:10,720
child pornography and
illegal pornography video.

3393
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:12,900
It's sorted by title with checksums.

3394
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:16,840
So that way if the police are scanning
Wifi or get somebody files from the

3395
01:25:16,841 --> 01:25:17,380
Internet,

3396
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:20,350
they can match the check some of the
file on their hard drive to one that's

3397
01:25:20,351 --> 01:25:21,910
already in the database
and see if it's in there.

3398
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:23,230
So they don't have to watch the video.

3399
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,250
Whoa.

3400
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,900
But they've got that database already,

3401
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:27,550
so it's impossible for a,

3402
01:25:27,551 --> 01:25:29,250
another video of the same,

3403
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,340
have the same amount of bytes.

3404
01:25:30,341 --> 01:25:31,800
Like what if it's exact same on a second.

3405
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:32,611
It's in the same as well.

3406
01:25:32,611 --> 01:25:33,130
It's the,

3407
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:35,500
it's possible based off the
content of the file as well.

3408
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:36,880
So it's not just a length thing,

3409
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:38,710
it's not just a size,

3410
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:39,200
it's a,

3411
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,791
there's an actual,

3412
01:25:39,791 --> 01:25:41,770
there's a thousand
attributes that go into it.

3413
01:25:41,771 --> 01:25:42,430
You know what,

3414
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:43,510
how are they reading that?

3415
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:46,780
Just did analyzing each
and every individual file.

3416
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:48,160
I think I this,

3417
01:25:48,161 --> 01:25:48,994
this is,

3418
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,440
this is pure conjecture actually,

3419
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:51,340
so I shouldn't be saying it,

3420
01:25:51,341 --> 01:25:53,140
but I would imagine if
you doing a check sum,

3421
01:25:53,141 --> 01:25:53,800
it could.

3422
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,780
It could just know that
every hundred bytes,

3423
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,160
here's a character string here,

3424
01:25:57,161 --> 01:25:58,510
so there's a check for it there.

3425
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,500
Every x bytes,

3426
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:00,850
this is the character
like this is the Hex,

3427
01:26:00,851 --> 01:26:01,420
put it there.

3428
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:04,250
I think it's way more elegant than that
because I can already poke holes in

3429
01:26:04,251 --> 01:26:04,850
that,

3430
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:06,570
but we'll think about how
there is a way to do it.

3431
01:26:06,571 --> 01:26:08,270
Think about how crazy show's name is.

3432
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:09,530
Think about that thing that,

3433
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,470
that program where you go to a club and
there's a song playing and you liked the

3434
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:16,550
song so precious and it sends a signal
and 10 seconds later it tells you what

3435
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:17,720
that fucking analyze the file.

3436
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:18,141
Here it is,

3437
01:26:18,141 --> 01:26:20,420
and I'm not exaggerating
if you never use Shizam,

3438
01:26:20,421 --> 01:26:21,800
it's fucking incredible.

3439
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:23,870
It's 10 seconds later I think of that.

3440
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,010
It's basically the same thing,

3441
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,840
but they haven't the time for TV as well.

3442
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:27,800
How'd that for video?

3443
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:29,050
They're going to have
that for all that shit.

3444
01:26:29,051 --> 01:26:31,190
Like the image recognition image engine.

3445
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:33,080
What a weird world we live in right now.

3446
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,630
Have you guys talked about
Siri becoming skynet?

3447
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:36,081
No,

3448
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:36,830
we haven't.

3449
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:37,470
I talked about,

3450
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:38,570
so you want to hop into that?

3451
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:39,141
Yes,

3452
01:26:39,141 --> 01:26:39,531
please.

3453
01:26:39,531 --> 01:26:43,650
Because someone actually sent me
something we had talked about on the show.

3454
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:44,060
It's a real,

3455
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:44,770
real quick dude.

3456
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:45,050
Sorry.

3457
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:46,400
Just so I don't get raped on Twitter.

3458
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:49,440
I believe you analyze the file
locally and it spits out a check on.

3459
01:26:49,441 --> 01:26:53,150
So it is checking every bit of the file
and then you check that against the

3460
01:26:53,151 --> 01:26:53,984
public checks them.

3461
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:54,470
Oh,

3462
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:55,690
just so I don't get,

3463
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,810
I don't want to deal with those tweets.

3464
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:57,590
Right.

3465
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:58,490
I can't do my soul.

3466
01:26:58,760 --> 01:26:59,990
It's not in my soul anymore,

3467
01:26:59,991 --> 01:27:00,231
man.

3468
01:27:00,231 --> 01:27:01,064
I'm just trying to help.

3469
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:01,911
So with that said,

3470
01:27:01,911 --> 01:27:02,410
I'm sorry,

3471
01:27:02,410 --> 01:27:02,961
w okay,

3472
01:27:02,961 --> 01:27:04,910
so someone wrote that,

3473
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:05,181
uh,

3474
01:27:05,181 --> 01:27:07,520
I said that Siri was
based on Wolfram Alpha,

3475
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,480
but it's not exactly true.

3476
01:27:09,481 --> 01:27:10,670
It's integrated rates.

3477
01:27:10,671 --> 01:27:11,181
Wolfram Alpha.

3478
01:27:11,181 --> 01:27:12,014
It's integrated.

3479
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,400
But this is where it gets crazy.

3480
01:27:13,401 --> 01:27:15,020
It's based on callow,

3481
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:20,230
the cognitive assistant that learns
and organizes from a company called Sri

3482
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:20,600
International.

3483
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,470
And it was artificial intelligence
augmentation software developed for Darpa.

3484
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:25,400
Right.

3485
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:29,270
Did Advanced Research Projects Agency.

3486
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:32,760
That's like those are the
motherfuckers that really are skynet.

3487
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:34,910
So if this is the version we have now,

3488
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:37,070
what's stopping them from
tapping a phone line,

3489
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:38,870
grabbing a voice chat,

3490
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:41,810
taking the audio from this podcast
and analyzing it in real time.

3491
01:27:41,811 --> 01:27:45,530
Just like Shizam and pulling out
those keywords and those context cues.

3492
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:48,320
This is fascinating because we have
the dumbed down version right now.

3493
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:50,750
They've got the hot dog on the
grill satellite version of it.

3494
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:51,823
So five version.

3495
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:52,041
Yeah.

3496
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:53,600
Why is it so crazy to think that,

3497
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:54,110
right?

3498
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:54,561
Yeah.

3499
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:55,150
And this is,

3500
01:27:55,150 --> 01:28:00,150
this guy also wrote something about
how Facebook was funded by a Tia.

3501
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:02,420
Total information awareness.

3502
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:06,470
Facebook is starting their own Super Pac
to lobby the government on privacy and

3503
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:09,350
information controls and what
we should have rights too.

3504
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,600
Cause they want to own the
rights to your usage data,

3505
01:28:11,601 --> 01:28:12,440
your social graph,

3506
01:28:12,441 --> 01:28:13,130
your preferences.

3507
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:14,150
They want to own that data.

3508
01:28:14,151 --> 01:28:17,390
They want essentially want
to own your imprint online,

3509
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:17,781
right?

3510
01:28:17,781 --> 01:28:19,820
They want to own your browsing
habits where you shop.

3511
01:28:19,821 --> 01:28:21,230
They want to know what music you like.

3512
01:28:21,231 --> 01:28:23,000
They want to know what
friends you connect with,

3513
01:28:23,001 --> 01:28:23,930
where you go,

3514
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:24,913
who do you share?

3515
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,900
I'm already my spacing Facebook lately.

3516
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:27,950
You know what I'm saying?

3517
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:29,060
But you're not,

3518
01:28:29,061 --> 01:28:30,800
you're f you're kind of
alone in that right now.

3519
01:28:30,801 --> 01:28:31,401
Like it's growing,

3520
01:28:31,401 --> 01:28:31,611
right?

3521
01:28:31,611 --> 01:28:32,444
It's growing more and more.

3522
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:36,230
Integrating more and more on Twitter has
kind of overtaken Facebook for the most

3523
01:28:36,231 --> 01:28:36,411
part.

3524
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:37,850
I know like when I talked to,

3525
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:39,380
I just tweet now.

3526
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:39,831
Yeah,

3527
01:28:39,831 --> 01:28:41,690
I know a lot of people that
don't do Facebook anymore.

3528
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:42,910
Well the interesting thing,

3529
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:44,450
they can still pull that
together for to tweet.

3530
01:28:44,451 --> 01:28:45,950
It's more real time.

3531
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,580
You know,

3532
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:46,791
you're,

3533
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:47,061
you're,

3534
01:28:47,061 --> 01:28:48,950
you're responding to
people back and forth.

3535
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:49,611
It's very,

3536
01:28:49,611 --> 01:28:52,490
in a very similar way to text messaging.

3537
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,031
You know,

3538
01:28:53,031 --> 01:28:53,460
it a lot.

3539
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:53,571
It's,

3540
01:28:53,571 --> 01:28:54,021
I mean it's,

3541
01:28:54,021 --> 01:28:54,241
it's,

3542
01:28:54,241 --> 01:28:56,420
it's essentially for a
lot of what I use it for.

3543
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:57,263
I mean,

3544
01:28:57,450 --> 01:28:59,030
I throw things out there,

3545
01:28:59,031 --> 01:28:59,960
interesting links.

3546
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:00,980
I retweet things,

3547
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:02,800
interesting things I observed,

3548
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:03,690
photos I take,

3549
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:05,880
but I also go back and forth with people.

3550
01:29:05,881 --> 01:29:05,991
I'll,

3551
01:29:05,991 --> 01:29:07,890
I'll shoot the shit with people
and it's people I went to,

3552
01:29:07,891 --> 01:29:08,191
you know,

3553
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:11,670
ordinarily never really get a chance to
run into or meet like my ex girlfriend.

3554
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:12,661
Oh yeah.

3555
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:13,321
Well she tripped.

3556
01:29:13,321 --> 01:29:16,740
She to the ridiculous like
facilitating a real time conversation.

3557
01:29:16,741 --> 01:29:17,970
Are you upset that I
said something to her?

3558
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:18,990
Oh,

3559
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:21,330
you would prefer no one
to communicate with her?

3560
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:23,013
No.

3561
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:26,210
[inaudible]

3562
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,721
you brought this up.

3563
01:29:27,721 --> 01:29:29,220
So I have said this,

3564
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,050
this is what I said.

3565
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:31,920
She,

3566
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,641
she's by the way,

3567
01:29:32,641 --> 01:29:35,250
is a penthouse pet of the year.

3568
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:36,000
Okay.

3569
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,840
Did and she writes,

3570
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:40,950
she's talking about another porno
star and the other porno star says,

3571
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:42,600
I feel a bad cold coming on.

3572
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:43,740
Who wants to make out?

3573
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:44,813
And she says,

3574
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:46,440
I'll make out with your butt.

3575
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,540
So I on Twitter say,

3576
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:49,493
wow,

3577
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:50,790
just wow.

3578
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:53,070
That's the extent of my
communication with her.

3579
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,153
Why are you trying to fuck?

3580
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:55,380
He says,

3581
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:56,370
what are you wowing?

3582
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:57,120
I ignore it.

3583
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:57,871
I just have to say,

3584
01:29:57,871 --> 01:29:58,350
wow,

3585
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:01,030
if you run around tweeting to the whole
world that you wouldn't make out with a

3586
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:02,183
a cold,

3587
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,690
caring porn stars.

3588
01:30:03,691 --> 01:30:05,760
But I got a while yet.

3589
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:06,361
Here's my,

3590
01:30:06,361 --> 01:30:08,340
I guess my question for
scissor trying to fuck her.

3591
01:30:08,341 --> 01:30:09,174
Joe,

3592
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,360
do you think that that,

3593
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:12,240
that there is somebody from Brian,

3594
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:17,280
do you think there is anybody at Siri
that is like w continuing to add to the

3595
01:30:17,281 --> 01:30:17,700
database?

3596
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,400
Do you think they're looking
at the top 10 things?

3597
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,150
Why does Siri need to connect to
the cloud for anything that I do,

3598
01:30:24,151 --> 01:30:25,560
even if it's a local operation,

3599
01:30:25,561 --> 01:30:25,890
right?

3600
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:27,030
Read my text messages.

3601
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,290
Those are already mine on my device.

3602
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,150
If I say play Joe Rogan's podcast,

3603
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:34,140
it has to send it to the cloud first and
they'll say it's for voice recognition.

3604
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:34,591
You know,

3605
01:30:34,591 --> 01:30:36,390
it's faster in the cloud
and answer to your phone,

3606
01:30:36,391 --> 01:30:38,010
but it's the program itself,

3607
01:30:38,011 --> 01:30:39,870
the database has to be huge for Siri,

3608
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:41,790
for local things that could store that.

3609
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:44,040
It could totally do that and
maybe they will in the future.

3610
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:45,050
But I think the reason they're,

3611
01:30:45,051 --> 01:30:48,390
they're making everything go to the net
is for the usage data because then they

3612
01:30:48,391 --> 01:30:49,740
can see what keywords are happening.

3613
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:51,030
They get better chance people are doing.

3614
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:51,511
Absolutely,

3615
01:30:51,511 --> 01:30:52,344
they can make it better.

3616
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,210
But with,

3617
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:55,440
with great power comes
great responsibility.

3618
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:59,640
And what's crazy is that I had a friend
that got mad at another friend for

3619
01:30:59,641 --> 01:31:00,540
cursing at his Siri.

3620
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:00,931
It'd be like,

3621
01:31:00,931 --> 01:31:01,711
fuck you Siri,

3622
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:01,981
you're a,

3623
01:31:01,981 --> 01:31:02,814
you're a bitch.

3624
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:03,960
And he took the phone away and he's like,

3625
01:31:03,961 --> 01:31:04,141
dude,

3626
01:31:04,141 --> 01:31:04,621
don't do that.

3627
01:31:04,621 --> 01:31:05,880
I don't want that in my profile.

3628
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,300
And he was concerned about
acting a certain way to an,

3629
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:09,530
uh,

3630
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:11,770
a pretty dumb artificial intelligence.

3631
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:12,481
The murder thing.

3632
01:31:12,481 --> 01:31:15,350
I've thought about the murder
thing and that's on file.

3633
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:16,490
Did you do the president thing yet?

3634
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:17,290
What are you talking about?

3635
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:18,070
Nothing.

3636
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:20,610
When you ask Siri a question
that's being stored somewhere,

3637
01:31:20,611 --> 01:31:23,220
that request is indefinitely
stored in some log right now.

3638
01:31:23,221 --> 01:31:28,221
So if you ever are presumed they ignored
you murder somebody or if someone

3639
01:31:28,351 --> 01:31:29,400
suspects you have a murder,

3640
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:31,080
they can now try it out on the stand.

3641
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:31,981
You asked your,

3642
01:31:31,981 --> 01:31:32,400
uh,

3643
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,800
your cell phone where to hide a body.

3644
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:34,980
I wonder if they have that.

3645
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:35,490
Is it,

3646
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,460
I want to know is does apple say anywhere
in those terms and agreement that

3647
01:31:38,461 --> 01:31:40,800
they're holding onto the data
of what we're saying in Siri?

3648
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:42,030
Is that one of the things,

3649
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:42,983
I'm sure,

3650
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:45,030
I'm sure it says that
it's from usage data,

3651
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:46,200
which what does that mean?

3652
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:47,820
I wonder that is kind of,

3653
01:31:47,821 --> 01:31:48,780
it's going to achieve that.

3654
01:31:48,781 --> 01:31:51,900
They have to send it out to the cloud.

3655
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:52,951
Now there's,

3656
01:31:52,951 --> 01:31:54,600
there's infrastructure reasons to do that.

3657
01:31:54,601 --> 01:31:57,210
There's also terrible usability
reasons to not do that.

3658
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:58,410
Being that if you have a t and t,

3659
01:31:58,411 --> 01:32:00,040
half the time doesn't work because

3660
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,270
you don't have a strong enough
signal to get out to her.

3661
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:03,850
What were faster?

3662
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:04,923
What?

3663
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:07,210
We're faster when it's available,

3664
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:08,560
so I'm on a t and t,

3665
01:32:08,561 --> 01:32:09,760
but it's still a shitty network.

3666
01:32:09,761 --> 01:32:11,020
There's no bones about that.

3667
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:11,660
Yeah.

3668
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:12,830
The H I couldn't do at.

3669
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:12,931
And.

3670
01:32:12,931 --> 01:32:16,600
T he told me the day I got a new iPhone
and he told me that ATNT what'd you guys

3671
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:20,370
change their system so that they can
get double the speed of download?

3672
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,201
Not Double.

3673
01:32:21,201 --> 01:32:22,034
It's,

3674
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:23,093
it could be.

3675
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,750
It's like it's 3.5 g.

3676
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:25,723
Well,

3677
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:27,031
it's faster.

3678
01:32:27,031 --> 01:32:27,271
Yes.

3679
01:32:27,271 --> 01:32:27,451
Yeah.

3680
01:32:27,451 --> 01:32:27,901
Whatever it is,

3681
01:32:27,901 --> 01:32:29,160
LTE is going to blow that away.

3682
01:32:29,161 --> 01:32:30,230
The next I felt guilty younger.

3683
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,060
Right.

3684
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:33,250
I don't have that in my current one,

3685
01:32:33,251 --> 01:32:37,390
but I do have Verizon and I just
was unable to pass on Verizon.

3686
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:38,470
Fry's is just too good.

3687
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:39,860
Why is it double is actually,

3688
01:32:39,861 --> 01:32:40,150
uh,

3689
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:40,880
have,

3690
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:41,390
uh,

3691
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:45,980
my girlfriend's new phone for us and the
f I foreign both on at and t did both

3692
01:32:45,981 --> 01:32:46,814
at the same time.

3693
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:47,140
Uh,

3694
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:50,090
those speeches I s was
double where I was at.

3695
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:50,953
That's great.

3696
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:52,160
That's a really good area.

3697
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:52,521
I mean,

3698
01:32:52,521 --> 01:32:54,380
I don't get those speeds anywhere myself.

3699
01:32:54,381 --> 01:32:56,360
I still get dropped calls in the India.

3700
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:56,990
The canyons.

3701
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:57,620
Yeah.

3702
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:58,453
But um,

3703
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:00,500
I think you look at how like,

3704
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,530
think about Siri has that API opens
up because right now I could say,

3705
01:33:03,531 --> 01:33:05,510
show me a good steak
restaurant and it'll do that.

3706
01:33:05,511 --> 01:33:06,344
It'll pop that up,

3707
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:06,650
you know,

3708
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:07,041
then I can say,

3709
01:33:07,041 --> 01:33:08,060
call that steak restaurant,

3710
01:33:08,061 --> 01:33:09,380
but once open table supports it,

3711
01:33:09,381 --> 01:33:09,711
I can say,

3712
01:33:09,711 --> 01:33:10,340
Hey Siri,

3713
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:10,610
right,

3714
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:13,280
but me reservation for four at six at
that restaurant and it's just going to

3715
01:33:13,281 --> 01:33:14,070
connect to the database.

3716
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:14,361
Do what?

3717
01:33:14,361 --> 01:33:14,990
There we go.

3718
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:15,980
Invite my friends,

3719
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:17,083
invite Joe.

3720
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:17,510
You know,

3721
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:18,590
the texting alone,

3722
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:20,570
I think is the best when
you're just driving.

3723
01:33:20,571 --> 01:33:21,404
You push a button.

3724
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,710
It was pretty accurate.

3725
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,800
Google has had that for a while.

3726
01:33:24,801 --> 01:33:25,880
It doesn't work this good though.

3727
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:28,160
This works almost perfect.

3728
01:33:28,490 --> 01:33:32,930
I probably fuck up more just doing it
by hand and it's weird speaking into it

3729
01:33:32,931 --> 01:33:34,910
cause you still got to kind
of talk to it like a robot.

3730
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,740
You can't be totally fluent with it.

3731
01:33:36,741 --> 01:33:38,240
And for like grammatical things,

3732
01:33:38,241 --> 01:33:40,400
like I'm still a stickler
with grammar even in text.

3733
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,121
So I'll be like,

3734
01:33:41,121 --> 01:33:41,631
hey Joe,

3735
01:33:41,631 --> 01:33:42,464
comma,

3736
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:44,030
I'm going to be a little late period.

3737
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:44,931
Hope that's okay.

3738
01:33:44,931 --> 01:33:45,510
Period.

3739
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:46,011
Does it right.

3740
01:33:46,011 --> 01:33:46,730
Period and Chroma.

3741
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:48,480
It actually drops the period ends.

3742
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:49,080
Yeah.

3743
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:49,500
Did,

3744
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,670
have you ever tried writing
like that with like a,

3745
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:51,951
you know,

3746
01:33:51,951 --> 01:33:52,850
I know they have a,

3747
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:54,040
what is it,

3748
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:54,660
the software,

3749
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:56,720
like a dragon naturally speaking.

3750
01:33:56,721 --> 01:33:57,540
Yeah,

3751
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:58,231
I tried that before,

3752
01:33:58,231 --> 01:33:59,940
but I write in a different,

3753
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:03,000
at a different pace with a different
cadence than cadence than I speak.

3754
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:05,250
So for me it was really disjointed.

3755
01:34:05,251 --> 01:34:07,380
Like I would say something and
they'd be wanting to change the,

3756
01:34:07,381 --> 01:34:08,370
I edit as I write.

3757
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:09,210
It's really,

3758
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:10,350
really a terrible way to right.

3759
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,420
But doing that verbally
it was even harder.

3760
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:13,070
I,

3761
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:14,490
it was already past the
sentence and I was like,

3762
01:34:14,491 --> 01:34:14,930
yeah,

3763
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:15,770
I agree with you.

3764
01:34:15,771 --> 01:34:16,604
As a matter of fact,

3765
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:21,640
I liked the idea of it and what I had
thought about doing was writing at the

3766
01:34:21,681 --> 01:34:25,250
same time as running the
program in the background.

3767
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:28,700
So the program would pick up some of
the words and some of the things that I

3768
01:34:28,701 --> 01:34:32,470
would say so just in case I couldn't
remember what the fuck I had said while I

3769
01:34:32,471 --> 01:34:33,530
was writing things.

3770
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:34,730
But I I agree with you,

3771
01:34:34,731 --> 01:34:35,091
there's a,

3772
01:34:35,091 --> 01:34:38,840
there's an intention to actually
physically typing out the each individual

3773
01:34:38,841 --> 01:34:39,470
letter.

3774
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:39,801
There's,

3775
01:34:39,801 --> 01:34:41,180
when the way I describe it as,

3776
01:34:41,181 --> 01:34:42,680
if you write the word occupy,

3777
01:34:42,830 --> 01:34:46,800
it takes longer to write the
word occupied then to know it

3778
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:50,000
or to know what you're saying.

3779
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:50,900
You know what you thinking.

3780
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:54,080
So it forces you to think about things
just a little bit longer and it,

3781
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:55,370
it creatively,

3782
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:58,460
it to me at least it
opens different avenues

3783
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,140
for possibilities for potentials.

3784
01:35:00,141 --> 01:35:02,210
Like the way I always get my biggest like,

3785
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:02,911
ah,

3786
01:35:02,911 --> 01:35:03,830
this is what I'm writing.

3787
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:04,430
Because like,

3788
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:04,641
I mean,

3789
01:35:04,641 --> 01:35:06,620
I get them in ad libbing
on stage and stuff.

3790
01:35:06,621 --> 01:35:07,070
Sure.

3791
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:10,040
But in actually sitting down
and writing about something,

3792
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:11,270
that's when you know,

3793
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,400
paths just appear.

3794
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:14,001
You know,

3795
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:15,590
roads just show themselves,

3796
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:16,401
you know,

3797
01:35:16,401 --> 01:35:17,360
and I don't think you'd see,

3798
01:35:17,361 --> 01:35:18,530
I get crippling anxiety.

3799
01:35:18,531 --> 01:35:19,450
I'd love to do it and it's,

3800
01:35:19,451 --> 01:35:20,480
it's so releasing.

3801
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:21,291
But when I do it,

3802
01:35:21,291 --> 01:35:22,124
I just see,

3803
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:25,850
I see those roads as highways that have
sheer cliffs at the end of them and I'm

3804
01:35:25,851 --> 01:35:26,031
just,

3805
01:35:26,031 --> 01:35:26,790
fuck,

3806
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:27,623
got to commit.

3807
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:29,960
You gotta commit to one that's not good.

3808
01:35:29,961 --> 01:35:30,650
Writing Music.

3809
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:31,060
What do you do?

3810
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:31,340
What do you do?

3811
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:32,210
You listen to music when you're right.

3812
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:34,250
I try to listen to the language
that I don't understand.

3813
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:37,190
I like Brazilian music
or Puerto Rican music.

3814
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:38,660
I like music with the lyrics.

3815
01:35:38,661 --> 01:35:39,890
Even if I don't understand them,

3816
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:42,410
I can do it in the background a little
bit as long as I don't understand it.

3817
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,840
Or sometimes if I'm really high,

3818
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:45,950
especially on edibles,

3819
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:49,430
I'll pick one song and just throw that
bitch on reboot and I'll listen to the

3820
01:35:49,431 --> 01:35:50,840
same song a hundred times in a row.

3821
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:51,090
Really?

3822
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:51,560
Yeah.

3823
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:52,220
Oh yeah.

3824
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:52,311
Oh,

3825
01:35:52,311 --> 01:35:54,350
so I wrote some of my
best shit on a plane.

3826
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:57,710
Blasted listening to the same
song over and over and over.

3827
01:35:57,730 --> 01:35:57,910
Yeah.

3828
01:35:57,910 --> 01:35:59,720
If you heard a song pumped up kicks,

3829
01:35:59,721 --> 01:36:00,441
I know you've probably had.

3830
01:36:00,441 --> 01:36:01,190
Yeah,

3831
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:01,600
they have you,

3832
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:02,930
you know what that Song's about?

3833
01:36:02,931 --> 01:36:04,930
Talked about this last part
I didn't know we talked.

3834
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:05,090
Yeah,

3835
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:05,721
we talked about,

3836
01:36:05,721 --> 01:36:07,600
I think we might've talked
about it off the air.

3837
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:09,460
I think we talked to in the green
room or something like that.

3838
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:10,280
But yeah,

3839
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,430
that's exactly what it was.

3840
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:13,430
That how the lyrics are
all about Columbine.

3841
01:36:13,431 --> 01:36:13,970
And it's like,

3842
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:16,760
that was one like a song I might
maybe listened to like 10 times.

3843
01:36:16,761 --> 01:36:17,630
Love this song.

3844
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:19,610
And then Johnny rotten told me like,

3845
01:36:19,611 --> 01:36:19,911
hey,

3846
01:36:19,911 --> 01:36:20,091
you know,

3847
01:36:20,091 --> 01:36:22,940
it's all about calling mine
and now it's even more crazy.

3848
01:36:22,941 --> 01:36:23,320
And I,

3849
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,500
I love bread lyrics.

3850
01:36:24,501 --> 01:36:24,741
I mean,

3851
01:36:24,741 --> 01:36:25,760
it's scary.

3852
01:36:25,761 --> 01:36:26,330
It's freaky.

3853
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:26,690
Yes,

3854
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:27,440
absolutely.

3855
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:31,190
But it's also crazy that people are just
dancing around it too without thinking

3856
01:36:31,191 --> 01:36:33,620
about nam fabrics came
into the octagon with that.

3857
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:34,521
Oh really?

3858
01:36:34,521 --> 01:36:36,140
That's what he was playing
when he came into the octagon.

3859
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:37,783
Interesting choice.

3860
01:36:37,990 --> 01:36:40,200
They run out run Maya.

3861
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:40,580
There's,

3862
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:41,271
I'll listen to,

3863
01:36:41,271 --> 01:36:42,350
there's like a spectrum of,

3864
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:45,890
there's like a frequency spectrum that's
supposed to induce that kind of zoning

3865
01:36:45,891 --> 01:36:47,210
out and I started riding with that lately.

3866
01:36:47,211 --> 01:36:48,920
It's pretty crazy what
you do it all the time.

3867
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:49,700
If you search,

3868
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:53,860
it's like there's meditation videos and
it's like 900 and something hurts a sine

3869
01:36:53,861 --> 01:36:54,291
waves,

3870
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:54,890
that kind of loop.

3871
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:56,690
But people have done made
them like pretty sounding,

3872
01:36:56,691 --> 01:36:57,560
not just an annoying thing,

3873
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:58,520
it's just filter sweeps.

3874
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:01,460
There were certain band pass that
triggers that sort of white noise effect.

3875
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:04,370
So what is it as you went
to like meditative noise
if you have headphones on,

3876
01:37:04,371 --> 01:37:05,204
it's like buying your role.

3877
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:05,991
It really,

3878
01:37:05,991 --> 01:37:06,501
it's kind of cool.

3879
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:08,060
So it's supposed to enhance creativity?

3880
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:08,451
No,

3881
01:37:08,451 --> 01:37:08,960
it's just,

3882
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,740
well if I think you like songs
with properties sometimes
that you just zone out

3883
01:37:12,741 --> 01:37:12,861
on,

3884
01:37:12,861 --> 01:37:13,011
right?

3885
01:37:13,011 --> 01:37:13,491
It's on a loop.

3886
01:37:13,491 --> 01:37:14,750
You let it go or are you listen to them?

3887
01:37:14,751 --> 01:37:16,280
So I like to be inspired too though,

3888
01:37:16,281 --> 01:37:16,521
man.

3889
01:37:16,521 --> 01:37:17,210
I like,

3890
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:17,750
you know,

3891
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:17,941
well,

3892
01:37:17,941 --> 01:37:18,141
yeah,

3893
01:37:18,141 --> 01:37:20,000
that's why it's not for
every writing moment,

3894
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:21,980
but sometimes it's great
to put on something that,

3895
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:22,460
that,

3896
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:23,750
that does kind of zone you out.

3897
01:37:23,751 --> 01:37:25,340
So you're only in that process.

3898
01:37:25,341 --> 01:37:28,850
That helps me because audible
distractions knocked me out like crazy.

3899
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,260
Sometimes.

3900
01:37:30,290 --> 01:37:30,980
Yes,

3901
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:31,791
sometimes no.

3902
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:33,620
It really depends on
where I'm at with writing,

3903
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:34,910
what I'm writing about,

3904
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:35,301
you know,

3905
01:37:35,301 --> 01:37:35,431
I,

3906
01:37:35,431 --> 01:37:35,600
I,

3907
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,930
there's sometimes I need to be
completely quiet completely by myself.

3908
01:37:38,931 --> 01:37:39,310
What,

3909
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:39,590
I mean,

3910
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:40,040
I'm a,

3911
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,890
obviously I'm a huge proponent of the
isolation tank and I come up with some of

3912
01:37:42,891 --> 01:37:43,970
my best ideas.

3913
01:37:43,971 --> 01:37:45,560
We're still having that,

3914
01:37:45,561 --> 01:37:47,750
did it sober for an hour
and that wasn't enough.

3915
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:48,740
That's crazy.

3916
01:37:48,741 --> 01:37:50,360
I can't believe I'm talking to you.

3917
01:37:50,361 --> 01:37:50,750
You know?

3918
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:53,900
That's one of the weird things that
people talk about online all the time that

3919
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:56,370
listen to this podcast
is how many of my friends

3920
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:58,560
or I'll fucking psychedelic freaks,

3921
01:37:58,710 --> 01:37:58,951
they're,

3922
01:37:58,951 --> 01:37:59,251
they're,

3923
01:37:59,251 --> 01:38:01,410
they're trippers and they've
never tried the tank.

3924
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:03,750
The tank is right by one.

3925
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:04,561
You,

3926
01:38:04,561 --> 01:38:05,370
you're crazy.

3927
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:06,210
You need to get in there.

3928
01:38:06,211 --> 01:38:06,870
Dude,

3929
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:07,950
you're just scared.

3930
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:08,910
I'm not scared.

3931
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:10,410
Just don't have money to spend on.

3932
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:10,820
I'll,

3933
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:10,991
I'll,

3934
01:38:10,991 --> 01:38:11,641
I'll set it up.

3935
01:38:11,641 --> 01:38:12,121
I'll set it up.

3936
01:38:12,121 --> 01:38:12,954
I promise you.

3937
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:13,591
I'll set it up.

3938
01:38:13,591 --> 01:38:14,311
We'll set it up this week.

3939
01:38:14,311 --> 01:38:14,910
I'll hook it up.

3940
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:15,600
I'll do it with you.

3941
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,111
If you're going to do it,

3942
01:38:16,111 --> 01:38:16,944
I'll do it

3943
01:38:18,590 --> 01:38:18,931
double day,

3944
01:38:18,931 --> 01:38:19,764
Bro.

3945
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:22,740
You need to get in there,

3946
01:38:22,741 --> 01:38:23,011
man.

3947
01:38:23,011 --> 01:38:26,880
Anybody who's analyzing
any part of their mind,

3948
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:27,743
their thoughts.

3949
01:38:27,790 --> 01:38:29,040
So the most amazing tool ever.

3950
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,630
I started to feel it probably,

3951
01:38:30,631 --> 01:38:33,480
I mean what I imagined
was 45 55 minutes into it.

3952
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:34,261
Even while sober,

3953
01:38:34,261 --> 01:38:35,130
like I really was like,

3954
01:38:35,131 --> 01:38:35,371
okay,

3955
01:38:35,371 --> 01:38:36,720
just let that shit go,

3956
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:37,141
you know,

3957
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:39,420
lose track and control
of where your fingertips.

3958
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:41,760
Then the water begins just
shut all that shit out.

3959
01:38:41,761 --> 01:38:44,770
And I started to get there and I swear
the moment I was getting their brands

3960
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:45,601
hatch open,

3961
01:38:45,601 --> 01:38:46,560
like your session's done.

3962
01:38:46,561 --> 01:38:46,890
I was like,

3963
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:47,723
Oh fuck.

3964
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:49,043
I caught the bug,

3965
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:50,051
but I've got to get back in.

3966
01:38:50,051 --> 01:38:50,521
And just like,

3967
01:38:50,521 --> 01:38:50,740
you know,

3968
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:52,410
we're talking to him in the
kitchen before the show.

3969
01:38:52,411 --> 01:38:55,620
He was asking me about a
dreaming and you know what?

3970
01:38:55,621 --> 01:38:59,050
Different nootropics that
create or enhance the,

3971
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:00,780
the possibility of lucid dreaming.

3972
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:05,250
And the thing about the lucid dream is
that it's really slippery because once

3973
01:39:05,251 --> 01:39:06,450
you realize you're dreaming,

3974
01:39:06,451 --> 01:39:07,530
you kind of wake up real quick.

3975
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:09,330
And that's the thing about the tank.

3976
01:39:09,331 --> 01:39:11,400
It's like these states
that you can achieve.

3977
01:39:11,401 --> 01:39:14,520
I have achieved some
really bizarre states,

3978
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:15,570
the most bizarre one.

3979
01:39:15,571 --> 01:39:16,620
I've talked about this before,

3980
01:39:16,621 --> 01:39:18,060
but it's so fascinating.

3981
01:39:18,061 --> 01:39:20,340
I have to bring it up and
I'd never do it justice.

3982
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:24,720
I was in a jungle and I was
with this indigenous population.

3983
01:39:24,721 --> 01:39:26,100
I don't know what their language was,

3984
01:39:26,101 --> 01:39:27,060
but I understood it.

3985
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:30,180
They were making a bunch of strange
noises and sounds and I was,

3986
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:34,140
I was thinking in their language or
yourself where you physically move as best

3987
01:39:34,141 --> 01:39:34,530
event.

3988
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:35,340
I was moving,

3989
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:36,420
I couldn't see myself.

3990
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,070
It wasn't a third person shooter.

3991
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:38,630
I was,

3992
01:39:38,630 --> 01:39:40,890
it was very first person
I was walking around.

3993
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:42,810
I remember feeling the dirt under my feet,

3994
01:39:42,811 --> 01:39:47,580
feeling the leaves and these people were
talking and I was talking with them or

3995
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:47,791
no,

3996
01:39:47,791 --> 01:39:48,690
I wasn't talking with them.

3997
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:52,050
I was understanding what they were saying
and as I was understanding what they

3998
01:39:52,051 --> 01:39:52,501
were saying,

3999
01:39:52,501 --> 01:39:54,720
I was realizing what the fuck.

4000
01:39:54,721 --> 01:39:55,411
I understand this,

4001
01:39:55,411 --> 01:39:58,770
but I was saying that to myself
in English and then I was like,

4002
01:39:58,771 --> 01:39:59,670
what is this?

4003
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:00,390
And then I was like,

4004
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:00,511
oh,

4005
01:40:00,511 --> 01:40:01,344
this is a dream.

4006
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:01,771
Boom.

4007
01:40:01,771 --> 01:40:02,604
And then it was over.

4008
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:05,280
But the moment while it was happening,

4009
01:40:05,281 --> 01:40:09,480
it was so amazing because it
only lasted a couple minutes.

4010
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:11,010
It was really brief.

4011
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:14,790
But in that couple of
minutes it was so crazy.

4012
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:15,780
The idea,

4013
01:40:15,781 --> 01:40:16,050
your,

4014
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:16,351
your,

4015
01:40:16,351 --> 01:40:17,490
your whatever it is,

4016
01:40:17,491 --> 01:40:18,900
whether it's imagination,

4017
01:40:18,901 --> 01:40:20,790
whether it's genetic memory,

4018
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:25,880
I mean you know who the fuck knows what
is stored in cells as they transfer from

4019
01:40:26,731 --> 01:40:28,470
generation to generation generation.

4020
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:33,620
There may very well be some wacky fucking
file and your hard drive and you just

4021
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:36,440
get in an isolation tank on
a pot Brownie and it goes,

4022
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:40,380
pops open this one little cartridge
that you weren't supposed to access that

4023
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:43,350
portion of your mental hard drive
and just beam that experience.

4024
01:40:43,351 --> 01:40:46,890
And there's some little monkey person
from 500,000 years ago walking through a

4025
01:40:46,891 --> 01:40:47,521
rain forest,

4026
01:40:47,521 --> 01:40:50,670
speaking in some dead language
before the cosmetic reset.

4027
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:51,570
If that was one of those,

4028
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,231
those lives,

4029
01:40:52,231 --> 01:40:53,230
that was one of those checkpoints,

4030
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:53,680
dude,

4031
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,160
here you go.

4032
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:54,580
It was the,

4033
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:55,990
it was one of the weirdest
things and the other,

4034
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:57,970
the other weirder one is I am,

4035
01:40:57,971 --> 01:40:59,730
what's the other weird ones?

4036
01:40:59,750 --> 01:41:03,370
I've had hundreds of thousands
of these guys' dicks.

4037
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:05,370
All it a wired like
you're just surrounded by,

4038
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:07,530
they have a dick inside of them.

4039
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:09,960
The Dick comes out like
the [inaudible] penises.

4040
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:11,320
Um,

4041
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,090
the,

4042
01:41:12,090 --> 01:41:17,090
the number one thing is that you can
never quite get deep enough like you get,

4043
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:19,953
you get,

4044
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:22,750
there's a bunch of videos of
me talking about this online,

4045
01:41:22,751 --> 01:41:25,030
but there's one of them that
some guy made on youtube.

4046
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:26,080
Thank you everybody.

4047
01:41:26,110 --> 01:41:28,230
Whoever does those fucking
videos and all you people doing,

4048
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,370
there's a bunch of people do them and
take a little clips out of the podcast.

4049
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:32,410
Your community does a phenomenal job of,

4050
01:41:32,411 --> 01:41:35,950
it's crazy you and everything you
say and they do a really great job.

4051
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:36,813
They're amazing.

4052
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:38,200
Super Fortunate.

4053
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:38,510
You know what,

4054
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:39,221
I always say that too,

4055
01:41:39,221 --> 01:41:40,210
when I go to comedy clubs too,

4056
01:41:40,211 --> 01:41:40,541
you know,

4057
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:40,731
the,

4058
01:41:40,731 --> 01:41:42,520
the people at comedy clubs
always say the same thing.

4059
01:41:42,521 --> 01:41:44,870
Like you have the nicest
fans then the nicest,

4060
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:45,733
most generous.

4061
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,500
And I don't know how that happened.

4062
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:48,850
Thank you very much.

4063
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:49,141
I don't know.

4064
01:41:49,141 --> 01:41:49,751
I don't know what it is.

4065
01:41:49,751 --> 01:41:50,050
I don't,

4066
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:50,201
you know,

4067
01:41:50,201 --> 01:41:51,740
I guess he put it out there and you know,

4068
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,890
you hope that people see
it the way you see it,

4069
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:54,910
but um,

4070
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:55,120
uh,

4071
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:55,570
for,

4072
01:41:55,570 --> 01:41:57,910
I think they respect if you
don't see it the way they see it.

4073
01:41:57,911 --> 01:41:58,540
And I think they,

4074
01:41:58,540 --> 01:41:59,950
they see that in you as well.

4075
01:41:59,951 --> 01:42:00,970
Like you're very respectful.

4076
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:02,440
Even if someone disagrees with you,

4077
01:42:02,441 --> 01:42:06,130
like you're able to have that conversation
when a large cross section of society

4078
01:42:06,131 --> 01:42:06,671
isn't well,

4079
01:42:06,671 --> 01:42:10,010
I certainly tried to hiring to see
that your fans carry that with them in

4080
01:42:10,011 --> 01:42:10,390
common.

4081
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:11,890
Like I always have a good
time chatting with your fans.

4082
01:42:11,891 --> 01:42:12,370
Always.

4083
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:12,701
Really.

4084
01:42:12,701 --> 01:42:13,190
That's awesome.

4085
01:42:13,190 --> 01:42:13,481
Always.

4086
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:13,810
Yeah.

4087
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:14,410
I mean there's going to be,

4088
01:42:14,410 --> 01:42:15,160
oh,

4089
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:16,000
no matter what you do,

4090
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:17,320
so there's going to be a
certain amount of people,

4091
01:42:17,321 --> 01:42:17,501
you know,

4092
01:42:17,501 --> 01:42:18,460
I wrote about this yesterday.

4093
01:42:18,461 --> 01:42:18,661
I was,

4094
01:42:18,661 --> 01:42:18,921
I was,

4095
01:42:18,921 --> 01:42:20,860
I was responding to a bunch of
people who were being insulting.

4096
01:42:20,861 --> 01:42:21,550
I was like,

4097
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:21,791
man,

4098
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:22,240
you know,

4099
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:25,660
you kind of learn how to communicate
with someone as if they were right there.

4100
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:26,200
You know?

4101
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:27,700
And so many people don't do that.

4102
01:42:27,701 --> 01:42:31,630
And the built in anonymity
that the Internet has,

4103
01:42:31,631 --> 01:42:35,470
has people have like
added it to like their,

4104
01:42:35,471 --> 01:42:35,711
their,

4105
01:42:35,711 --> 01:42:36,610
their rights.

4106
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:36,941
You know,

4107
01:42:36,941 --> 01:42:39,610
it's almost like you're allowed to
be a cut because you're anonymous.

4108
01:42:39,611 --> 01:42:43,300
It's like there's a certain amount of
disrespect that people allow it to like

4109
01:42:43,301 --> 01:42:44,230
shine on people.

4110
01:42:44,231 --> 01:42:44,830
It's like,

4111
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:45,011
man,

4112
01:42:45,011 --> 01:42:46,330
this is not necessary.

4113
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:46,820
You know,

4114
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:50,590
like there was a conversation that Duncan
and I were having and that some people

4115
01:42:50,591 --> 01:42:52,510
loved and some people just did not love.

4116
01:42:52,511 --> 01:42:53,081
And there was,

4117
01:42:53,081 --> 01:42:53,290
uh,

4118
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:54,880
some of the discussion about it was like,

4119
01:42:55,150 --> 01:43:00,150
it was so bizarre how some people just
have no problem just being completely

4120
01:43:00,851 --> 01:43:03,580
fucking rude when they know
that you're going to read it,

4121
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:04,271
you know?

4122
01:43:04,271 --> 01:43:09,271
And they're talking about it in a way
that's just not even remotely considering

4123
01:43:09,971 --> 01:43:11,200
how a person's going to receive it.

4124
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:11,861
I it's,

4125
01:43:11,861 --> 01:43:12,071
it's,

4126
01:43:12,071 --> 01:43:13,570
it's the whole age thing too.

4127
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,960
I bet a lot of these people
are like 13 and 14 right?

4128
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:16,500
Yeah.

4129
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:16,690
Well,

4130
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:17,740
there's no way we can stop that.

4131
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:18,650
You know what I mean?

4132
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:20,380
Unless we figure out
some way to register it.

4133
01:43:20,381 --> 01:43:20,561
I mean,

4134
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:24,310
we know that a wick was posting on my
message for when he was 13 years old.

4135
01:43:24,311 --> 01:43:24,940
That's ridiculous.

4136
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:25,540
You know,

4137
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:26,180
and yeah.

4138
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:26,980
See one of the good ones.

4139
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:27,161
Yeah,

4140
01:43:27,161 --> 01:43:27,701
he's great.

4141
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:28,181
He's great.

4142
01:43:28,181 --> 01:43:28,361
Yeah.

4143
01:43:28,361 --> 01:43:28,700
He's a,

4144
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:31,810
he's actually going to be our science
adviser when he graduates from school.

4145
01:43:31,811 --> 01:43:34,360
I think I'm going to hook them up with
a job and he'll be our science advisors.

4146
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,310
I was so many times
when we talk about shit,

4147
01:43:36,311 --> 01:43:38,360
we don't know what the fuck we're talking
about and he's pulling his hair out in

4148
01:43:38,361 --> 01:43:40,280
Houston so we're going
to have to hire him.

4149
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:41,350
I was,

4150
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:46,350
I was shocked at the anger and vitriol
that even my fans had initially when I

4151
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:50,080
started talking about like occupy and
started talking about other things.

4152
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:50,401
Really,

4153
01:43:50,401 --> 01:43:50,891
and that was a little,

4154
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:51,200
I was,

4155
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,250
I was a little shattered

4156
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:53,090
and it made me question,

4157
01:43:53,091 --> 01:43:55,010
should I even be talking about this?

4158
01:43:55,011 --> 01:43:56,060
Should I be taking a stance?

4159
01:43:56,061 --> 01:43:56,570
And then I was like,

4160
01:43:56,570 --> 01:43:56,781
no,

4161
01:43:56,781 --> 01:43:58,820
absolutely I should be
because I want to be.

4162
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:03,050
And immediately when I started engaging
in the conversations with the guys that

4163
01:44:03,051 --> 01:44:04,400
were all caps,

4164
01:44:04,401 --> 01:44:05,210
hatred,

4165
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:10,210
no matter what it was like pretty much
99% of them either turned around and saw

4166
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,021
at least recognize.

4167
01:44:12,021 --> 01:44:14,690
That was another point of view or tone
down the rhetoric rhetoric and was like,

4168
01:44:14,691 --> 01:44:14,811
Hey,

4169
01:44:14,811 --> 01:44:14,991
look,

4170
01:44:14,991 --> 01:44:15,141
you know,

4171
01:44:15,141 --> 01:44:15,621
I disagree,

4172
01:44:15,621 --> 01:44:17,510
but I appreciate that you're
doing what you're doing.

4173
01:44:17,570 --> 01:44:19,670
And people just want to get
your fucking attention clearly,

4174
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:20,991
clearly,

4175
01:44:20,991 --> 01:44:21,620
clearly.

4176
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:24,080
But this is the kind of
thing though where you know,

4177
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:25,191
you never know.

4178
01:44:25,191 --> 01:44:26,420
So you have to engage,

4179
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:27,141
you have to engage.

4180
01:44:27,141 --> 01:44:27,974
If people are like,

4181
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:28,401
well,

4182
01:44:28,401 --> 01:44:29,840
this is wrong and this
is factually correct,

4183
01:44:29,841 --> 01:44:30,021
it's like,

4184
01:44:30,021 --> 01:44:30,111
well,

4185
01:44:30,111 --> 01:44:30,231
no,

4186
01:44:30,231 --> 01:44:31,160
here's the story.

4187
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:31,581
Read it.

4188
01:44:31,581 --> 01:44:32,414
Have you seen it?

4189
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:37,450
You have to engage because for every
troll there is one person who doesn't look

4190
01:44:37,671 --> 01:44:38,360
up the address.

4191
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:40,180
It doesn't have access
to be upset about shit.

4192
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:41,950
Even if that shit has
nothing to do with it.

4193
01:44:41,951 --> 01:44:43,270
Like I can't tell you when you fucking,

4194
01:44:43,271 --> 01:44:44,950
people were upset at
this Alpha brain shit.

4195
01:44:44,990 --> 01:44:46,350
Then I'm selling these nootropics,

4196
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:46,571
these,

4197
01:44:46,571 --> 01:44:47,404
these vitamins,

4198
01:44:47,850 --> 01:44:51,490
but just going crazy on
Twitter about it's a placebo.

4199
01:44:51,491 --> 01:44:53,920
You're ripping people off
and this is what I said,

4200
01:44:53,921 --> 01:44:54,940
I said very clearly,

4201
01:44:54,941 --> 01:44:57,670
and I repeat this at every
fucking step of the way.

4202
01:44:58,150 --> 01:45:03,150
The proprietary blend that we have in
that Alpha brain is available online.

4203
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,500
If you're interested
and you are on a budget,

4204
01:45:05,501 --> 01:45:10,501
please go to a vitamin store or order
the individual components can get is

4205
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:12,450
exactly.

4206
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:13,780
You can get it at a discounted rate.

4207
01:45:13,781 --> 01:45:16,120
You could probably save
like 50% or something.

4208
01:45:16,121 --> 01:45:17,740
I don't know if I see the big,

4209
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:20,650
big thing is that [inaudible]
he's using all the good shit,

4210
01:45:20,651 --> 01:45:21,484
so in the pills,

4211
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,540
the good shit is the best
stuff that we can sell.

4212
01:45:25,570 --> 01:45:27,090
What is the best stuff that's available?

4213
01:45:27,091 --> 01:45:30,150
I think I've noticed lately
point though I don't.

4214
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:30,821
I really,

4215
01:45:30,821 --> 01:45:34,810
I my my number one concern when I
talk about anything that I like,

4216
01:45:34,811 --> 01:45:36,820
anything that's benefited
my life and know this,

4217
01:45:36,821 --> 01:45:38,500
this is a true statement.

4218
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:39,220
I,

4219
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:40,440
there's no exaggeration in,

4220
01:45:40,441 --> 01:45:41,740
there's no hyperbole whatsoever.

4221
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:42,310
I,

4222
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:43,570
if I'm telling you about it,

4223
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:46,420
I want you to do it because
I think it will benefit you.

4224
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,290
That's it.

4225
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:47,900
I,

4226
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:49,420
I'm not trying to sell shit.

4227
01:45:49,450 --> 01:45:52,180
I'm not trying to say I have a fucking
tee shirt line that I never bring up.

4228
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:53,980
It's called higher primate doc clothing,

4229
01:45:54,070 --> 01:45:56,380
higher-primate.com if I
can never bring it up.

4230
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:57,760
I wear the tee shirts every now and then.

4231
01:45:57,761 --> 01:45:58,541
I want people to buy them.

4232
01:45:58,541 --> 01:45:59,320
If you like them.

4233
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:00,131
I see people with them.

4234
01:46:00,131 --> 01:46:00,400
It shows,

4235
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:00,821
it shows.

4236
01:46:00,821 --> 01:46:01,810
I think it's cool as fuck.

4237
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:03,670
I'm not trying to make a ton of money.

4238
01:46:03,670 --> 01:46:03,901
I don't know.

4239
01:46:03,901 --> 01:46:04,570
I just,

4240
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:05,351
I feel like him,

4241
01:46:05,351 --> 01:46:05,861
I like him.

4242
01:46:05,861 --> 01:46:07,990
I thought it'd be cool to
have some funky tee shirts,

4243
01:46:07,991 --> 01:46:09,730
have a monkey's on psychedelics.

4244
01:46:09,970 --> 01:46:10,721
Nobody had them.

4245
01:46:10,721 --> 01:46:12,070
So I decided to make my own company.

4246
01:46:12,071 --> 01:46:12,904
It's that simple.

4247
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:13,720
I'm not.

4248
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:17,320
I make plenty of money doing
standup and from the UFC.

4249
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:20,830
I would never get behind anything that
I didn't believe surprises me though.

4250
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,420
You have to explain that my God,

4251
01:46:22,421 --> 01:46:22,871
your viewers,

4252
01:46:22,871 --> 01:46:24,160
because I just have to explain it.

4253
01:46:24,161 --> 01:46:26,250
Get in fucking furious
arguments with people,

4254
01:46:26,251 --> 01:46:28,040
but the delicacy of
these things where you,

4255
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:30,320
you can't give them enough
scientific information.

4256
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:30,611
Well,

4257
01:46:30,611 --> 01:46:31,650
those ones falls hours.

4258
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:32,091
Patients,

4259
01:46:32,091 --> 01:46:32,800
Ms. Smith,

4260
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:35,120
you're telling me it's something that
benefits Alzheimer's patient can't

4261
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:36,250
possibly benefit people,

4262
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:37,720
so it has an effect on their mind,

4263
01:46:37,721 --> 01:46:39,130
but it won't have an
effect on a healthy mind.

4264
01:46:39,370 --> 01:46:40,360
It's a fucking placebo.

4265
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:41,020
Some guy said,

4266
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:41,950
you know what's better than that?

4267
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,270
Sleep and exercise.

4268
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:44,080
Yeah,

4269
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:44,741
but guess what?

4270
01:46:44,741 --> 01:46:45,280
Fuck face.

4271
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,670
You can have sleep and
exercise and beds and vitamins.

4272
01:46:48,671 --> 01:46:50,610
Don't tell the vitamins don't
work because they do work.

4273
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:51,563
Vitamins are excellent.

4274
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,580
I have video Lygo.

4275
01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:54,780
It's a skin condition
where I lose pigment.

4276
01:46:54,781 --> 01:46:55,560
You can see it in my,

4277
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:56,770
like my knuckle was Jacksons.

4278
01:46:56,790 --> 01:46:57,150
I lose.

4279
01:46:57,150 --> 01:46:57,391
Yeah,

4280
01:46:57,391 --> 01:47:00,240
but I only have a little
couple spots and it's stopped.

4281
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:00,481
You know,

4282
01:47:00,481 --> 01:47:01,800
when it stopped vitamins,

4283
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:03,120
I got heavily into vitamins.

4284
01:47:03,121 --> 01:47:04,170
When I first came to California,

4285
01:47:04,171 --> 01:47:05,640
I was under a tremendous amount of stress.

4286
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:09,360
I had never been on TV before and I
noticed like get like these white spots on

4287
01:47:09,361 --> 01:47:09,721
my skin.

4288
01:47:09,721 --> 01:47:09,961
I was like,

4289
01:47:09,961 --> 01:47:10,794
what the fuck is this?

4290
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,120
And they started spreading man.

4291
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:13,350
I started going to doctors.

4292
01:47:13,351 --> 01:47:17,490
I was going to a different video Lygo
specialist and I would have to take these

4293
01:47:17,491 --> 01:47:18,720
things called Soar Linz.

4294
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:19,351
And uh,

4295
01:47:19,351 --> 01:47:21,210
there were pills that made
me super sensitive to light.

4296
01:47:21,211 --> 01:47:22,140
And then I have to get in like,

4297
01:47:22,170 --> 01:47:23,250
it's almost like a tanning booth,

4298
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:25,380
but you only go in there
for three minutes and it's,

4299
01:47:25,381 --> 01:47:26,640
are they tried to tan the pigment?

4300
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:27,360
In fact,

4301
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:27,490
no,

4302
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:27,630
no.

4303
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:29,280
It's shocks the system.

4304
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:29,910
Um,

4305
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:30,601
where the,

4306
01:47:30,601 --> 01:47:32,190
the parts that are losing pigment,

4307
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:34,440
it can bring them back to life
and it works in a certain way.

4308
01:47:34,441 --> 01:47:34,661
I,

4309
01:47:34,661 --> 01:47:36,690
I repeat like my doctor
Melatonin and they'd be like,

4310
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:37,081
come on,

4311
01:47:37,081 --> 01:47:37,561
sort of,

4312
01:47:37,561 --> 01:47:39,240
I don't know the exact science behind it,

4313
01:47:39,241 --> 01:47:42,330
but I had areas that were lost
pigment and brought them back.

4314
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:45,000
But you know what stopped all of it
completely stopped in its tracks.

4315
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:48,840
Vitamins 100% one cause you
know received in those vitamins.

4316
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:49,410
Let's see,

4317
01:47:49,410 --> 01:47:50,250
people are assholes.

4318
01:47:50,251 --> 01:47:51,061
Listen to and vitamins,

4319
01:47:51,061 --> 01:47:51,570
fucking word,

4320
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:52,590
healthy diet works.

4321
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:53,740
Vitamins work even too,

4322
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,660
but all of it works.

4323
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:56,730
These people that would have held
solely and show me the science.

4324
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,890
Where do you think they got the vitamins?

4325
01:47:58,891 --> 01:48:03,420
Witchcraft you fuck did you do the most
lacking vitamins from food and the way

4326
01:48:03,421 --> 01:48:05,520
they're doing it is a scientific method.

4327
01:48:05,610 --> 01:48:06,271
They've done this,

4328
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:09,900
they've applied scientific principles to
extracting vitamins and they sell these

4329
01:48:09,901 --> 01:48:10,734
fucking buy it.

4330
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:12,840
If you don't believe in Alpha brain,

4331
01:48:12,841 --> 01:48:12,911
no,

4332
01:48:12,911 --> 01:48:13,980
you don't believe in vitamins.

4333
01:48:13,981 --> 01:48:14,611
That's good for you.

4334
01:48:14,611 --> 01:48:18,330
But if you're fucking fighting people
tooth and nail on something that they

4335
01:48:18,331 --> 01:48:19,500
absolutely believe in,

4336
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:21,030
you're just trying to fight man.

4337
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:24,600
And I guarantee you most likely what it
is with a lot of these people is they're

4338
01:48:24,601 --> 01:48:25,890
not happy with their own life.

4339
01:48:25,891 --> 01:48:27,120
And they're probably smart,

4340
01:48:27,121 --> 01:48:28,050
but they're fucked up.

4341
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,510
And what they're doing is
they're focusing something,

4342
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:31,680
whether it's online,

4343
01:48:31,681 --> 01:48:32,670
whether it's an argument,

4344
01:48:32,671 --> 01:48:35,160
whether it's trying to win
a flame war or whatever,

4345
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:39,450
and that becomes their distraction
from their miserable existence that are

4346
01:48:39,451 --> 01:48:41,880
garbage pile up and they're
fucking kitchen their bills.

4347
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:42,241
You know,

4348
01:48:42,241 --> 01:48:43,290
their phone ringing off the hook.

4349
01:48:43,630 --> 01:48:47,010
There's the kind of person who could
use a little faith in a placebo,

4350
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:47,370
right?

4351
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:50,010
Rather than being against it if it works,

4352
01:48:50,011 --> 01:48:50,640
go with it.

4353
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:53,670
But here's the sad part about the really
sad part about some of these people are

4354
01:48:53,671 --> 01:48:55,080
very fucking smart.

4355
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:56,610
They're very interesting.

4356
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:57,210
They're the,

4357
01:48:57,210 --> 01:48:57,501
the,

4358
01:48:57,501 --> 01:48:57,781
the,

4359
01:48:57,781 --> 01:48:58,980
the points that they make,

4360
01:48:59,010 --> 01:49:00,510
even though they're nonsense points,

4361
01:49:00,511 --> 01:49:02,210
they're very eloquently stated there,

4362
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:03,300
argued very well,

4363
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,540
who said there's a very professional
tone to the way they're writing things.

4364
01:49:06,541 --> 01:49:06,721
I'm like,

4365
01:49:06,721 --> 01:49:08,160
this is a guy who,

4366
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:08,581
you know,

4367
01:49:08,581 --> 01:49:10,200
obviously there's something
wrong with this person.

4368
01:49:10,201 --> 01:49:10,301
They're,

4369
01:49:10,301 --> 01:49:12,590
they're really going after this is it?

4370
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:16,600
He's just as passionate as the facts that
he's collected to support his opinion.

4371
01:49:16,601 --> 01:49:16,740
No,

4372
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:16,930
no,

4373
01:49:16,930 --> 01:49:17,130
no,

4374
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:17,280
no.

4375
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:17,971
Not these people.

4376
01:49:17,971 --> 01:49:20,040
And I'm talking about there was no
facts and they'd never know personal

4377
01:49:20,041 --> 01:49:21,060
experience whatsoever on these things.

4378
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:22,110
I'm sure I'm not,

4379
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:23,340
I'm not speaking for those people.

4380
01:49:23,341 --> 01:49:24,350
I'm just saying that that there,

4381
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:26,280
I've ran across this where there is like,

4382
01:49:26,281 --> 01:49:26,700
you know,

4383
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:29,220
data is the easiest fucking thing
in this world to manipulate.

4384
01:49:29,221 --> 01:49:30,240
Any study can be skewed.

4385
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:32,460
You can prove this global
warming doesn't exist.

4386
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:34,900
You can prove pretty much whatever
you want with numbers that way.

4387
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:37,560
The way you skewed my point
though was that there,

4388
01:49:37,590 --> 01:49:39,600
there's obviously they're powerful.

4389
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:42,120
This is a good version of a human,

4390
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:43,620
like this isn't a dope,

4391
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:45,330
this isn't some fucking ditch.

4392
01:49:45,331 --> 01:49:48,130
Do you wish that they were
donating their processes to

4393
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,470
more positive costs as
opposed to being so negating?

4394
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:50,861
You know,

4395
01:49:50,861 --> 01:49:54,160
it's fascinating that that would be a
subject that would drive you nuts whether

4396
01:49:54,161 --> 01:49:55,120
or not vitamins work,

4397
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:57,490
you know when they're on brain and
brain brain vitamins where like what a,

4398
01:49:57,491 --> 01:49:59,410
what a weird thing to get all hyped about.

4399
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:03,430
He might be idolizing you though and
this is something that he believes though

4400
01:50:03,431 --> 01:50:06,760
and so this one issue with you has now
shattered that and he has to prove you

4401
01:50:06,761 --> 01:50:06,910
wrong.

4402
01:50:06,910 --> 01:50:07,581
Going to be that.

4403
01:50:07,581 --> 01:50:12,180
Or it could be the hyper fan or he
could own 40 cats or contrarion.

4404
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:14,070
There's some people that are
just fucking control agents.

4405
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:18,700
They just lord teen battle or I don't
think it's are 14 I think there's a lot of

4406
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:20,380
older folks I had,

4407
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:21,273
I dunno,

4408
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:22,360
it doesn't matter.

4409
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:27,390
The point is that the way the Internet
is set at set up now with the and anatomy

4410
01:50:28,090 --> 01:50:29,230
anonymity that's built in,

4411
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:31,660
it's so easy for someone to be a Twat.

4412
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:32,530
It's so easy.

4413
01:50:32,531 --> 01:50:34,330
There's like virtually no repercussions,

4414
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:38,470
but slowly that's going to change
and you better brace for it.

4415
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:39,100
Okay.

4416
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:42,760
Because the shit's going to come down
on all you fuck eds because you're not

4417
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:44,110
going to be anonymous
for very much longer.

4418
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:44,380
Right.

4419
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:45,213
You know,

4420
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:49,150
suck boy 69 on fucking reddit
or whatever the hell you know,

4421
01:50:49,151 --> 01:50:49,841
message board.

4422
01:50:49,841 --> 01:50:50,950
You Act like a shit head on.

4423
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:54,220
You're going the underground forum and
mixed martial arts.com or on my own

4424
01:50:54,221 --> 01:50:55,054
message board,

4425
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:57,730
you're not going to be
anonymous that much longer.

4426
01:50:58,140 --> 01:50:59,260
It's really inevitable.

4427
01:50:59,290 --> 01:51:02,950
There's a clear trend and
that trend is connectivity.

4428
01:51:02,951 --> 01:51:06,080
That trend is in interlacing
of information and you're,

4429
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:08,920
you're not going to be able to
avoid all the aspects of your life.

4430
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:09,560
That's why I wrote,

4431
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:12,200
I wrote an I wired article
like aimed at anonymous,

4432
01:51:12,230 --> 01:51:14,960
which I know was opening up the flood
gates for me to just be attacked,

4433
01:51:14,961 --> 01:51:16,700
but my message to them was,

4434
01:51:16,701 --> 01:51:17,151
hey guys,

4435
01:51:17,151 --> 01:51:17,541
listen.

4436
01:51:17,541 --> 01:51:20,600
Like I know it's fun to deface websites
and I know it's fun to have Twitter

4437
01:51:20,601 --> 01:51:20,961
accounts,

4438
01:51:20,961 --> 01:51:22,220
but you need to,

4439
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:23,090
maybe you're younger,

4440
01:51:23,091 --> 01:51:24,320
maybe you just don't give a fuck.

4441
01:51:24,321 --> 01:51:25,850
Maybe you really are
doing it for the lols,

4442
01:51:25,851 --> 01:51:29,840
but you need to not get busted for
the simple trivial shit right now.

4443
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:33,110
Trolling people online and putting out
their data because we need you for the

4444
01:51:33,111 --> 01:51:33,770
fight.

4445
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:34,570
The real fight.

4446
01:51:34,570 --> 01:51:35,210
You know,

4447
01:51:35,210 --> 01:51:39,140
low sec just got turned in by
an anonymous website proxy.

4448
01:51:39,141 --> 01:51:39,590
They were like,

4449
01:51:39,590 --> 01:51:39,741
oh,

4450
01:51:39,741 --> 01:51:40,161
wait a sec.

4451
01:51:40,161 --> 01:51:40,401
Yes,

4452
01:51:40,401 --> 01:51:42,380
we definitely do this,

4453
01:51:42,381 --> 01:51:43,730
but in our thing I says,

4454
01:51:43,731 --> 01:51:47,810
don't do anything illegal and here we're
giving the cops to the information.

4455
01:51:47,811 --> 01:51:48,740
So they all got arrested.

4456
01:51:48,741 --> 01:51:50,900
This people that hack
what was a playstation?

4457
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:55,160
The real issue is just
like occupy Wall Street.

4458
01:51:55,190 --> 01:51:56,090
Who's in anonymous,

4459
01:51:56,091 --> 01:51:56,930
who's in La Sec.

4460
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:57,411
There's just,

4461
01:51:57,411 --> 01:51:58,300
it's an open door,

4462
01:51:58,301 --> 01:51:58,470
right?

4463
01:51:58,470 --> 01:51:59,180
Any crazy?

4464
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:00,260
Who's on my message board?

4465
01:52:00,261 --> 01:52:00,951
It's an open door.

4466
01:52:00,951 --> 01:52:02,330
Any crazy asshole can join up.

4467
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:03,440
Certainly someone could,

4468
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:05,950
someone could deface a website in the
name of anonymous if you ever know.

4469
01:52:05,951 --> 01:52:07,540
And that's absolutely happening now.

4470
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:08,531
There was a,

4471
01:52:08,531 --> 01:52:12,430
there was a fake anonymous video posted
to have like a to Hack Wall Street day.

4472
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:13,600
And it was like on a Monday,

4473
01:52:13,601 --> 01:52:14,920
it was on a holiday and everybody said,

4474
01:52:14,921 --> 01:52:19,150
this is clearly a plant because anonymous
would never be so stupid as to attack

4475
01:52:19,330 --> 01:52:21,590
the attack the markets on a,

4476
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:24,640
on a holiday when the markets aren't that
volatile and they would never post it

4477
01:52:24,641 --> 01:52:25,474
in these ways.

4478
01:52:25,570 --> 01:52:26,650
And people are already,

4479
01:52:26,651 --> 01:52:27,880
it's agent provocateur scores.

4480
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:29,280
Just like the guy in the city bank.

4481
01:52:29,470 --> 01:52:31,030
They're doing that out
of the fucking rallies,

4482
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:31,211
you know,

4483
01:52:31,211 --> 01:52:32,110
they're doing that as hacking.

4484
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:33,360
What does this matter?

4485
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:34,840
This mother fuckers anybody want on there?

4486
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:35,701
That'd be awesome.

4487
01:52:35,701 --> 01:52:36,180
But yeah,

4488
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:38,490
this is my friend Tom Atencio,

4489
01:52:38,491 --> 01:52:39,121
the guy who,

4490
01:52:39,121 --> 01:52:39,480
uh,

4491
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,370
was one of the original
creators of affliction.

4492
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:43,950
He left affliction and he doesn't
work for affliction anymore.

4493
01:52:43,951 --> 01:52:44,784
So I stopped.

4494
01:52:45,110 --> 01:52:49,230
I stopped wearing their shit cause he's
my friend sweet logo though I liked now.

4495
01:52:49,231 --> 01:52:50,060
Um,

4496
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:53,600
he created the limelight
fusion energy drinks.

4497
01:52:53,601 --> 01:52:54,980
They're pretty fucking delicious.

4498
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:56,280
They're healthy too.

4499
01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:56,930
I don't know.

4500
01:52:56,930 --> 01:52:57,200
Yeah,

4501
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:57,861
just started dragging him.

4502
01:52:57,861 --> 01:52:58,600
He just sent me a box.

4503
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:03,600
Well but there's a Ginkgo Biloba and
him and Jen sang and 200 for 50% of a,

4504
01:53:05,451 --> 01:53:06,201
the vitamin B,

4505
01:53:06,201 --> 01:53:11,201
six a hundred percent of the Niacin and
800% of your vitamin B 12 for the day.

4506
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:13,183
So there's a,

4507
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:14,510
there's lots of good stuff in it.

4508
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:16,710
It tastes good to mix
that with some vodka.

4509
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:17,041
If I,

4510
01:53:17,041 --> 01:53:18,590
if I drink this rocket fuel right now,

4511
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:19,820
am I going to be up until 8:00 AM?

4512
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:20,141
No,

4513
01:53:20,141 --> 01:53:20,300
no,

4514
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:20,961
it's not that bad.

4515
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:22,040
It's not like a red bull.

4516
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:22,551
It's not,

4517
01:53:22,551 --> 01:53:23,510
it's not by,

4518
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:24,321
but by the way,

4519
01:53:24,321 --> 01:53:26,360
I should state that I have a
high tolerance to caffeine.

4520
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:27,200
In fact,

4521
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:27,830
I,

4522
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:29,270
I quit caffeine for a day.

4523
01:53:29,271 --> 01:53:30,920
I took yesterday off and I had a headache,

4524
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:34,010
my first cup of coffee of the day.

4525
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:34,791
This is my first cup.

4526
01:53:34,791 --> 01:53:35,690
And I'm okay today,

4527
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:37,310
but that's usually how it is for me.

4528
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:38,470
I've done this before where I've,

4529
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:40,100
especially when I'm writing a lot,

4530
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:40,530
uh,

4531
01:53:40,530 --> 01:53:43,880
I drank a lot of coffee and then
the next day I have a headache.

4532
01:53:43,881 --> 01:53:44,780
I need a cup of coffee,

4533
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:48,350
but if I take a full day and go through
the full day and drink a lot of water

4534
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:49,071
the next day,

4535
01:53:49,071 --> 01:53:49,904
it's pretty much gone.

4536
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:51,110
It's like one day that's pretty good at,

4537
01:53:51,111 --> 01:53:52,340
you can cycle back down there.

4538
01:53:52,341 --> 01:53:53,030
Yeah.

4539
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:54,200
That's my only addiction.

4540
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:56,060
I have a physical addiction to caffeine,

4541
01:53:56,210 --> 01:54:00,470
but it's not a physical addiction where
it's painful or it's like a terrible

4542
01:54:00,471 --> 01:54:01,250
itch.

4543
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:01,910
It's just like,

4544
01:54:01,910 --> 01:54:02,181
oh,

4545
01:54:02,181 --> 01:54:02,841
I don't feel so good,

4546
01:54:02,841 --> 01:54:05,570
but you know what cures
that fucking serious,

4547
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:06,650
ruthless workout.

4548
01:54:06,770 --> 01:54:07,371
Just get a a,

4549
01:54:07,371 --> 01:54:07,841
just a,

4550
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:08,930
a maniac,

4551
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:09,860
caveman,

4552
01:54:09,861 --> 01:54:10,694
savage,

4553
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,110
adrenaline pumping,

4554
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,210
testosterone bleeding.

4555
01:54:14,230 --> 01:54:16,430
We're workout just where you fucking go.

4556
01:54:16,431 --> 01:54:21,380
Full grape ape on something and then it
just resets your system and then water's

4557
01:54:21,381 --> 01:54:21,740
fine.

4558
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:22,550
I tried to do that,

4559
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:25,700
hung over before and it's just shattered
my body for like three or four weeks

4560
01:54:25,701 --> 01:54:26,534
and you work out.

4561
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:27,261
I've been like,

4562
01:54:27,261 --> 01:54:27,321
oh,

4563
01:54:27,321 --> 01:54:28,310
I'm a little hung over.

4564
01:54:28,370 --> 01:54:29,210
I'm a lot hung over.

4565
01:54:29,211 --> 01:54:30,500
I'm going to go to the
gym and sweat it out,

4566
01:54:30,501 --> 01:54:31,430
get those toxins out.

4567
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:34,700
But I pushed it way too far and it
shatters my immune system for like three

4568
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:34,971
weeks.

4569
01:54:34,971 --> 01:54:35,630
It's terrible.

4570
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:40,520
Best Formula I've ever found for hangovers
is this fucking alpha brain shit and

4571
01:54:40,521 --> 01:54:41,450
coconut juice.

4572
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:43,360
I love coconut juice and
a lot of people don't.

4573
01:54:43,361 --> 01:54:43,580
I,

4574
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:44,241
and I'll tell you what,

4575
01:54:44,241 --> 01:54:44,751
this brand,

4576
01:54:44,751 --> 01:54:45,740
I'm not going to mention the name,

4577
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:46,783
not so tasty.

4578
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:49,681
I think c two,

4579
01:54:49,681 --> 01:54:52,160
I was the Beth or Amy
and Brian's pretty good.

4580
01:54:52,410 --> 01:54:53,243
Awesome.

4581
01:54:55,910 --> 01:54:58,010
He tells the best and they send it to us.

4582
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,470
So you're saying take one
of the placebos are those,

4583
01:55:00,471 --> 01:55:01,260
this is the shelf.

4584
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:02,093
The brain seat.

4585
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:02,960
Two O's.

4586
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:03,980
Fucking delicious.

4587
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:05,210
And I know a lot of people say,

4588
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:05,581
oh,

4589
01:55:05,581 --> 01:55:08,090
I tried coconut cheers
like dirty dishwater.

4590
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:09,171
I hear you.

4591
01:55:09,171 --> 01:55:11,810
Some brands actually do this blank brand.

4592
01:55:11,811 --> 01:55:12,770
It's fucking delicious.

4593
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,700
And the reason I got hooked in this brand,

4594
01:55:14,701 --> 01:55:16,790
and we were at Jujitsu and
it's one of our buddies,

4595
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:17,240
uh,

4596
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:18,230
brought a whole case of it.

4597
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:20,750
And apparently in Brazil they
drink a lot of coconut water.

4598
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,500
And uh,

4599
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,000
we were having a,

4600
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,060
a g day,

4601
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:23,810
10 plans,

4602
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:24,171
Jujitsu.

4603
01:55:24,171 --> 01:55:27,410
We rolled out a g the G is like
the traditional uniform of Jujitsu,

4604
01:55:27,411 --> 01:55:28,640
but we,

4605
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:30,470
the idea that Eddie had was that,

4606
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:30,830
you know,

4607
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:31,341
first of all,

4608
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:33,890
in no d competitions,

4609
01:55:33,891 --> 01:55:35,870
a lot of the techniques of
Jiujitsu Jujitsu don't work.

4610
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:37,070
And in mixed martial arts,

4611
01:55:37,071 --> 01:55:39,170
you obviously don't have
a g so you should learn,

4612
01:55:39,230 --> 01:55:42,750
there's like with the gift of grabbed
people easier and it's more traction,

4613
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:44,040
it's easier to hold on to people.

4614
01:55:44,610 --> 01:55:46,170
So it's hard to get them to grab you,

4615
01:55:46,171 --> 01:55:47,160
which is exactly right.

4616
01:55:47,330 --> 01:55:48,690
That's the hoists Gracie strategy.

4617
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:51,090
He would fight with a g on
and Strykers would grab him.

4618
01:55:51,091 --> 01:55:51,924
They couldn't help it.

4619
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:53,011
So anyway,

4620
01:55:53,011 --> 01:55:54,150
they drank a lot of coconut juice.

4621
01:55:54,151 --> 01:55:56,850
So we had a good day and he brought
a bunch of coconut juice to like,

4622
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:57,361
you know,

4623
01:55:57,361 --> 01:56:00,690
like out of respect for resilience because
they love to drink coconut juice and

4624
01:56:00,691 --> 01:56:00,841
he goes,

4625
01:56:00,841 --> 01:56:01,441
you want to try one?

4626
01:56:01,441 --> 01:56:02,040
And then like,

4627
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:02,520
okay,

4628
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:03,211
just be nice.

4629
01:56:03,211 --> 01:56:03,451
You know,

4630
01:56:03,451 --> 01:56:03,721
I'm like,

4631
01:56:03,721 --> 01:56:04,800
coconut juice tastes like shit.

4632
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:05,370
Right.

4633
01:56:05,370 --> 01:56:06,151
But I drank this stuff.

4634
01:56:06,151 --> 01:56:06,391
I was like,

4635
01:56:06,391 --> 01:56:06,841
fuck,

4636
01:56:06,841 --> 01:56:07,860
this is delicious.

4637
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:09,390
It's like the perfect flavor.

4638
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,280
Does it have like the coconut pulp in it?

4639
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:13,910
Cause I had one like that and like that.

4640
01:56:13,911 --> 01:56:14,310
It's not,

4641
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:15,240
I'm on on a ride with that.

4642
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:16,130
They have the coconut.

4643
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:16,291
Yeah.

4644
01:56:16,291 --> 01:56:18,300
This one is so much better than this one.

4645
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:18,731
They're,

4646
01:56:18,731 --> 01:56:19,590
they're a totally d.

4647
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:20,970
I don't know what the fuck they're doing.

4648
01:56:21,090 --> 01:56:21,923
C Two oh,

4649
01:56:22,170 --> 01:56:22,800
email me.

4650
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:23,850
Tell me what the fuck you're doing.

4651
01:56:23,851 --> 01:56:24,990
Why is your coconut juice?

4652
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:26,100
Do you put sugar in here?

4653
01:56:26,101 --> 01:56:26,500
Bitch,

4654
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:31,500
Unicorn [inaudible] many students in
there and he wasn't even going to come to

4655
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:32,413
calorie.

4656
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:33,080
Oh I dunno.

4657
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:33,280
I man,

4658
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:33,930
I don't read that Shit.

4659
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:35,790
They sell it on Amazon too.

4660
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:37,890
I get you could have it signed up to it.

4661
01:56:37,891 --> 01:56:39,780
They send you a whole
case like every week.

4662
01:56:39,781 --> 01:56:40,141
That's what I,

4663
01:56:40,141 --> 01:56:40,440
damn,

4664
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:41,970
I got an Amazon one click on my phone.

4665
01:56:41,971 --> 01:56:43,200
That shit is so addictive.

4666
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:43,920
I'll have a thought.

4667
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:45,620
Even my HUD socks,

4668
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:46,710
anything.

4669
01:56:46,710 --> 01:56:47,041
I Dunno.

4670
01:56:47,041 --> 01:56:48,360
I impulse buy everything man.

4671
01:56:48,450 --> 01:56:49,261
Rolling papers.

4672
01:56:49,261 --> 01:56:50,950
I buy my rolling papers on Amazon.

4673
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:51,511
I got something.

4674
01:56:51,511 --> 01:56:52,080
You got to do that.

4675
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:54,330
Although I'm going to stop being
a medical marijuana patient.

4676
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:55,260
Why?

4677
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:56,610
I'm going to stop smoking marijuana?

4678
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:58,830
Because you can't have a gun anymore.

4679
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:00,360
You can't have a gun or bullets.

4680
01:57:00,361 --> 01:57:03,390
The federal government is saying that
you cannot have a gun or bullets because

4681
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:03,980
the,

4682
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:04,470
uh,

4683
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:07,320
federal law dictates that marijuana
is a schedule one substance.

4684
01:57:07,470 --> 01:57:09,390
And so when you apply to the alcohol,

4685
01:57:09,391 --> 01:57:09,871
tobacco,

4686
01:57:09,871 --> 01:57:10,501
and Firearms,

4687
01:57:10,501 --> 01:57:11,820
for a gun,

4688
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:13,530
for to get a permit to buy a gun,

4689
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:15,270
you have to say that you,

4690
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:15,840
uh,

4691
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:18,270
you are a user of marijuana

4692
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:20,941
controlled substance.

4693
01:57:20,941 --> 01:57:21,280
So,

4694
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:21,590
wow,

4695
01:57:21,590 --> 01:57:22,200
I have to quit weight.

4696
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:23,430
Did they check the medical database?

4697
01:57:23,431 --> 01:57:24,630
So I'm gonna go to whiskey buddy.

4698
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:25,111
No,

4699
01:57:25,111 --> 01:57:26,070
but national database,

4700
01:57:26,071 --> 01:57:26,460
dude,

4701
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:27,293
it doesn't matter.

4702
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:28,891
They didn't matter.

4703
01:57:28,891 --> 01:57:29,431
It doesn't matter.

4704
01:57:29,431 --> 01:57:29,880
Listen,

4705
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:31,680
the ATF does not fuck around,

4706
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:31,981
right?

4707
01:57:31,981 --> 01:57:34,920
If you lie on your form that you don't
smoke weed and they come to your house

4708
01:57:34,921 --> 01:57:35,880
and there's weeding the gun,

4709
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:36,211
honey,

4710
01:57:36,211 --> 01:57:37,120
you've got to get an unwell.

4711
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:37,731
That's the,

4712
01:57:37,731 --> 01:57:39,780
that's how they got al Capone.

4713
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:40,411
You know how they that him,

4714
01:57:40,411 --> 01:57:41,490
they got him for tax evasion,

4715
01:57:41,530 --> 01:57:41,791
right?

4716
01:57:41,791 --> 01:57:42,020
They didn't,

4717
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:44,310
they didn't get them for running
whiskey and shooting people in the head.

4718
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:46,320
Is that retroactive like anatomy?

4719
01:57:46,730 --> 01:57:48,190
I own several firearms.

4720
01:57:48,191 --> 01:57:49,350
Exactly and yeah,

4721
01:57:49,351 --> 01:57:49,771
exactly.

4722
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:50,640
Thankfully I don't smoke pot,

4723
01:57:50,641 --> 01:57:51,061
but if I did,

4724
01:57:51,061 --> 01:57:52,360
I didn't really concern that glee.

4725
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:55,740
I stopped smoking pot and just
squares here with a bunch of squares.

4726
01:57:55,741 --> 01:57:56,101
It is.

4727
01:57:56,101 --> 01:57:56,970
It's disgusting.

4728
01:57:56,971 --> 01:57:57,280
It's,

4729
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:58,350
I pay my taxes.

4730
01:57:58,351 --> 01:58:02,850
I'm a fucking constitutional believe in
American constitutional believing as it

4731
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:03,451
didn't make sense.

4732
01:58:03,451 --> 01:58:05,280
I sound like it did to the
people you were firing up.

4733
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:06,630
This is what I'm saying.

4734
01:58:06,631 --> 01:58:07,464
God dammit.

4735
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,540
You should be able to
have fucking guns and joy.

4736
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:11,580
Little Weed and who do I want with a gun?

4737
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:14,520
Do I want a guy on pain
pills on fucking ambien?

4738
01:58:14,590 --> 01:58:17,700
You all want to guy was drinking whiskey
or do I want a guy who was high and

4739
01:58:17,701 --> 01:58:19,380
paranoid is not going to shoot anybody,

4740
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:20,281
but that's the guy,

4741
01:58:20,281 --> 01:58:21,210
not paranoid part.

4742
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:22,073
Leave out the paranoia.

4743
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:23,640
Paranoid people are going to hide.

4744
01:58:23,641 --> 01:58:25,920
They're not going to go shooting people
that you're not going to rush into

4745
01:58:25,921 --> 01:58:26,670
violence.

4746
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:27,421
If you're paranoid,

4747
01:58:27,421 --> 01:58:27,601
you're like,

4748
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:28,500
let me get the fuck out of here.

4749
01:58:28,501 --> 01:58:28,711
Man,

4750
01:58:28,711 --> 01:58:29,730
what the shoe bag.

4751
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:30,511
You know,

4752
01:58:30,511 --> 01:58:30,900
I don't,

4753
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:34,860
I don't think that marijuana inhibits
your judgment to the point where having a

4754
01:58:34,861 --> 01:58:35,540
gun,

4755
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:36,373
uh,

4756
01:58:36,590 --> 01:58:39,150
it makes it prohibitive or
it makes it a dangerous,

4757
01:58:39,151 --> 01:58:40,680
I think if anything,

4758
01:58:40,681 --> 01:58:41,890
it's going to make you a scaredy cat.

4759
01:58:41,891 --> 01:58:42,940
It's going to make you nervous.

4760
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:44,470
It's going to make you,

4761
01:58:44,530 --> 01:58:47,350
it's gonna make you more
sensitive to the possibilities of,

4762
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:47,920
you know,

4763
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:49,900
hurting somebody or hurting yourself.

4764
01:58:50,070 --> 01:58:50,380
Yeah.

4765
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:50,831
But they don't want to,

4766
01:58:50,831 --> 01:58:53,480
I don't want you to do as
a bad trip and you know,

4767
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:56,670
thanks to see and shit off of an edible
and start shooting somebody that's going

4768
01:58:56,671 --> 01:58:56,870
to hurt.

4769
01:58:56,870 --> 01:58:59,260
That's bad science because what about
the million people that don't pull their

4770
01:58:59,261 --> 01:59:00,490
guns out because they are high.

4771
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:00,801
Right.

4772
01:59:00,801 --> 01:59:01,190
You know,

4773
01:59:01,190 --> 01:59:01,841
and then just say,

4774
01:59:01,841 --> 01:59:02,800
let's just let this go.

4775
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:04,660
Any number of can be manipulated.

4776
01:59:04,661 --> 01:59:04,811
I mean,

4777
01:59:04,811 --> 01:59:05,050
it's,

4778
01:59:05,050 --> 01:59:08,220
it's clearly no worse than being able
to like drink at a bar and had a shotgun

4779
01:59:08,230 --> 01:59:10,540
rack on your truck or
when you're driving home.

4780
01:59:10,541 --> 01:59:12,310
No show different than
places that allow that.

4781
01:59:12,380 --> 01:59:13,390
That's fucking crazy.

4782
01:59:13,391 --> 01:59:14,200
It's fucking crazy.

4783
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:15,730
It's fucking UNAMERICAN man.

4784
01:59:15,731 --> 01:59:16,031
It's on,

4785
01:59:16,031 --> 01:59:20,470
it's on American to step in and say that
if you want to have something that the

4786
01:59:20,471 --> 01:59:24,730
states have voted on and it you have a
god damned white and their states' rights

4787
01:59:24,731 --> 01:59:26,320
are supposed to supersede federal rights,

4788
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:29,980
you're supposed to be able to decide
what you can and can't use and the state

4789
01:59:29,981 --> 01:59:30,731
comes along and says,

4790
01:59:30,731 --> 01:59:31,031
you know what?

4791
01:59:31,031 --> 01:59:32,560
We've looked at all the
information and guess what?

4792
01:59:32,710 --> 01:59:33,940
There's a lot of people
with Glaucoma Comas,

4793
01:59:33,941 --> 01:59:34,860
a lot of people with cancers,

4794
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:36,910
a lot of people that anxiety is a lot
of people with all sorts of different

4795
01:59:36,911 --> 01:59:37,660
fucking elements.

4796
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:39,940
Marijuana has a lot of people
who know why it's illegal.

4797
01:59:39,950 --> 01:59:41,620
I think it's fucked up
and want to get high.

4798
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:43,000
I shouldn't need glaucoma.

4799
01:59:43,001 --> 01:59:43,900
I don't want to smoke weed.

4800
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:45,550
The bottom line about marijuana,

4801
01:59:45,551 --> 01:59:46,361
this is the bottom line.

4802
01:59:46,361 --> 01:59:47,260
This is one way to look at,

4803
01:59:47,261 --> 01:59:48,790
and my friend Todd
Mccormick brought this up.

4804
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:50,110
He said it's a commodity.

4805
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:54,400
It's no different than corn
or apples or pork bellies,

4806
01:59:54,550 --> 01:59:56,290
and it should be
considered as a commodity,

4807
01:59:56,291 --> 01:59:58,150
and if it is considered as a commodity,

4808
01:59:58,151 --> 01:59:58,941
then you have to look well,

4809
01:59:58,941 --> 02:00:02,080
why is this commodity being
kept from the marketplace?

4810
02:00:02,081 --> 02:00:03,130
Who's benefiting?

4811
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:03,330
Right.

4812
02:00:03,330 --> 02:00:04,690
And follow the fucking money.

4813
02:00:04,870 --> 02:00:06,370
Follow the money trail because guess what?

4814
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:06,760
They don't.

4815
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:09,820
There's not a goddamn thing
in the world that's useless.

4816
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:10,990
That makes no money,

4817
02:00:11,020 --> 02:00:13,570
that people are beating down the
doors trying to make illegal.

4818
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:15,070
There's not a single one.

4819
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,870
There's not a single one that you,

4820
02:00:16,871 --> 02:00:20,080
it has to be worth something to
somebody to keep that shit illegal.

4821
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:21,310
That's the only way they spend money.

4822
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:22,171
When you that,

4823
02:00:22,171 --> 02:00:22,291
yeah,

4824
02:00:22,291 --> 02:00:25,720
it was an industrial complex cops who
enforced this shit that don't want to lose

4825
02:00:25,721 --> 02:00:26,140
their job,

4826
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:27,910
even though many of
them now are forwarding.

4827
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:30,700
Most cops are in this day and age.

4828
02:00:30,701 --> 02:00:34,960
When you get a fucking
person on television who
represents the United States

4829
02:00:34,961 --> 02:00:35,500
government,

4830
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:39,790
and they start talking about going
after real estate owners for renting out

4831
02:00:39,791 --> 02:00:41,640
property to these cannabis shops,

4832
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:43,690
they're going to steal
their fucking property.

4833
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:47,110
The government's going to come in from
hardworking Americans who put the fucking

4834
02:00:47,111 --> 02:00:48,220
businesses for rent.

4835
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:48,821
They have this,

4836
02:00:48,821 --> 02:00:50,050
they buy a place.

4837
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:50,440
They say,

4838
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:51,550
well now I'll rent this place out.

4839
02:00:51,551 --> 02:00:52,900
I'll make myself a nice little product.

4840
02:00:52,901 --> 02:00:53,580
This,

4841
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:54,413
what do you do?

4842
02:00:54,910 --> 02:00:57,970
You sell medical marijuana
legally under state guidelines.

4843
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:58,630
Okay,

4844
02:00:58,630 --> 02:01:02,350
well there is proposition to 15 it was
passed in 1994 that's been a long time.

4845
02:01:02,350 --> 02:01:03,220
It's been legal in the state,

4846
02:01:03,221 --> 02:01:05,800
so go ahead and do your business and the
federal government comes in and says,

4847
02:01:05,801 --> 02:01:05,891
no,

4848
02:01:05,891 --> 02:01:09,100
we're going to steal your fucking house
because you rented out to someone who

4849
02:01:09,101 --> 02:01:09,850
sells pot.

4850
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:10,990
Fuck man.

4851
02:01:11,150 --> 02:01:12,370
It's in and people will say,

4852
02:01:12,371 --> 02:01:12,821
why do you,

4853
02:01:12,821 --> 02:01:14,170
why do you tweak out about this stuff?

4854
02:01:14,230 --> 02:01:15,250
Why do you let it bother you?

4855
02:01:15,251 --> 02:01:15,550
Why?

4856
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:17,470
Because it is the ultimate fuck.

4857
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:19,450
It's the ultimate ridiculous thing.

4858
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:24,460
You have a plant that's literally one
of the most beneficial plants on earth,

4859
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:27,460
and I'm not even talking about
the psychoactive portions of it.

4860
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:28,870
I'm talking about the use of it.

4861
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:29,351
First of all,

4862
02:01:29,351 --> 02:01:31,330
it contains all the amino
acids you can eat it.

4863
02:01:31,331 --> 02:01:32,530
It's got high in protein.

4864
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:34,690
Hemp protein is like some of
the best protein you can get.

4865
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:35,740
You can make oil.

4866
02:01:35,741 --> 02:01:36,550
None of this shit.

4867
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:38,860
You can make fucking bio
diesel out of this shit.

4868
02:01:38,970 --> 02:01:41,000
You make superior paper out of this shit.

4869
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,410
You make clothes out of this shit.

4870
02:01:42,411 --> 02:01:43,970
It's way stronger than cotton.

4871
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,410
It sounds fake.

4872
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:47,850
When you start listing all the different
cool shit that you can make with it,

4873
02:01:47,851 --> 02:01:49,250
it literally sounds like you're lying.

4874
02:01:49,251 --> 02:01:50,290
It sounds like you bullshit way.

4875
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:53,090
This has completely better properties
than anything else on the market.

4876
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:54,170
Absolutely,

4877
02:01:54,170 --> 02:01:54,591
but wait,

4878
02:01:54,591 --> 02:01:56,710
it grows in any weather
condition for the most part.

4879
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:59,540
I think about all the trees they
get chopped down to make paper,

4880
02:01:59,630 --> 02:02:01,310
how much fucking paper we use every day.

4881
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:06,350
You can make four times as much paper
in the same acreage of marijuana and it

4882
02:02:06,351 --> 02:02:08,150
grows back in six months.

4883
02:02:08,190 --> 02:02:09,170
Who's pack right there?

4884
02:02:09,390 --> 02:02:09,950
Hey,

4885
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:12,950
instead of 20 fucking years or whatever
the hell it takes to grow back your

4886
02:02:12,951 --> 02:02:13,820
paper for trees.

4887
02:02:14,020 --> 02:02:14,320
It's,

4888
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:15,380
it's amazing.

4889
02:02:15,410 --> 02:02:15,651
It's a,

4890
02:02:15,651 --> 02:02:19,520
it's one of the prime fucks and it's one
of the things that has to be addressed

4891
02:02:19,670 --> 02:02:19,940
in this.

4892
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:20,960
Even if you disagree,

4893
02:02:20,961 --> 02:02:21,291
I'm sorry,

4894
02:02:21,291 --> 02:02:22,840
but even if you disagree with,

4895
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:26,330
with what it can do or why it can do it
or the propaganda out there and even if

4896
02:02:26,331 --> 02:02:27,590
you feel reefer madness and drugs,

4897
02:02:27,591 --> 02:02:27,741
drugs,

4898
02:02:27,741 --> 02:02:28,160
drugs,

4899
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:28,440
the,

4900
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:28,691
the,

4901
02:02:28,691 --> 02:02:30,830
the sheer violation of rights.

4902
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:32,960
Federal Government comes
in and as you said,

4903
02:02:32,961 --> 02:02:36,350
boots you out of your fucking business
that you put your neck on the line for

4904
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:38,750
and try to do legally
according to state law,

4905
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:41,930
that should have everybody in rage
regardless of what the subject is.

4906
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:43,251
Not only that,

4907
02:02:43,251 --> 02:02:47,120
how about prioritizing our
fucking problems when we're
living in a day and age

4908
02:02:47,121 --> 02:02:49,220
where there's rampant
crime all over the place,

4909
02:02:49,221 --> 02:02:52,550
people are getting carjacked and shot and
you look at the fucking murder rate in

4910
02:02:52,551 --> 02:02:53,360
Los Angeles,

4911
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:58,360
20 million fucking people stuffed into
one small area and traffic and nonsense

4912
02:02:58,371 --> 02:03:00,080
and car theft and home invasions.

4913
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:04,640
You look in all that and you're telling
me that you need civil servants to go

4914
02:03:04,641 --> 02:03:06,770
after a plant and it makes people silly.

4915
02:03:07,490 --> 02:03:12,260
You're going to waste a
fucking tax dollars are western
people for selling silly

4916
02:03:12,261 --> 02:03:12,890
plants,

4917
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:14,520
for selling plants and
make food taste better.

4918
02:03:14,521 --> 02:03:15,470
It makes sex taste better.

4919
02:03:15,530 --> 02:03:16,700
Make movies more awesome.

4920
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:17,871
Really,

4921
02:03:17,871 --> 02:03:18,900
you fuck heads.

4922
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:19,481
It's,

4923
02:03:19,481 --> 02:03:20,930
it's the ultimate fuck you.

4924
02:03:21,050 --> 02:03:22,490
It's the ultimate power move.

4925
02:03:22,491 --> 02:03:23,324
It's the ultimate.

4926
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:25,910
This is not a free country move.

4927
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:26,901
It really is.

4928
02:03:26,901 --> 02:03:28,550
And yet it's happening and it's happening.

4929
02:03:28,551 --> 02:03:29,450
So now what?

4930
02:03:29,690 --> 02:03:29,931
Well,

4931
02:03:29,931 --> 02:03:31,850
now what does occupy
Wall Street is now what?

4932
02:03:31,851 --> 02:03:32,031
Now?

4933
02:03:32,031 --> 02:03:35,220
What is the bubble has
burst when occupies oiling.

4934
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:37,400
So when occupy starts
having signs that say,

4935
02:03:37,401 --> 02:03:38,480
give us back our weed,

4936
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:41,240
then they're going to try to roll on the
movement and say that it's just another

4937
02:03:41,241 --> 02:03:42,074
hippie movement.

4938
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:42,980
All of these kids want,

4939
02:03:42,981 --> 02:03:44,000
or their fucking drugs,

4940
02:03:44,001 --> 02:03:45,170
they're not going to be able to do that.

4941
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:46,490
I think it's a mandate for that.

4942
02:03:46,491 --> 02:03:47,510
I think it's too late for that.

4943
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:48,680
I think it's already gotten too big.

4944
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:48,921
Oh,

4945
02:03:48,921 --> 02:03:49,190
I don't,

4946
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:49,701
I don't think it had,

4947
02:03:49,701 --> 02:03:52,010
I don't think it's gotten big enough
with the people who need to believe it's

4948
02:03:52,011 --> 02:03:52,580
for them.

4949
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:52,701
Well,

4950
02:03:52,701 --> 02:03:53,690
it's going to get bigger.

4951
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:54,171
Right?

4952
02:03:54,171 --> 02:03:56,360
But it's going to be get beer because
they're going to put their ad dollars

4953
02:03:56,361 --> 02:03:59,570
behind portraying the
movement as a pro weed.

4954
02:03:59,571 --> 02:04:00,780
This is what they care about movement.

4955
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:03,170
Excellent marginalized
feel at this point in time.

4956
02:04:03,171 --> 02:04:06,200
This 50% of Americans in the most
recent Gallup poll said that they want

4957
02:04:06,201 --> 02:04:07,034
marijuana illegal.

4958
02:04:07,190 --> 02:04:08,420
That's higher than it's ever been before.

4959
02:04:08,421 --> 02:04:09,950
It's the first time ever that it's past.

4960
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:13,520
The people that want it illegal for
[inaudible] still be half the country

4961
02:04:13,521 --> 02:04:14,000
though.

4962
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:14,571
That is like,

4963
02:04:14,571 --> 02:04:14,991
fuck you.

4964
02:04:14,991 --> 02:04:15,950
That shit needs to be illegal.

4965
02:04:15,951 --> 02:04:16,491
That's what you hit.

4966
02:04:16,491 --> 02:04:17,001
These are about,

4967
02:04:17,001 --> 02:04:18,950
forget it and it divides
us up into teams again.

4968
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:19,940
That's what I'm saying.

4969
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:20,661
I don't think so.

4970
02:04:20,661 --> 02:04:21,141
I don't Cook it.

4971
02:04:21,141 --> 02:04:25,640
That's going to be the the boiling point
or rather just like they don't have a

4972
02:04:25,641 --> 02:04:25,911
leader.

4973
02:04:25,911 --> 02:04:26,930
There's not going to be one thing.

4974
02:04:26,931 --> 02:04:28,670
They're gonna attack this
thing for every fucking,

4975
02:04:28,671 --> 02:04:30,740
what I'm saying is I don't
think it's a good point.

4976
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:33,850
The marijuana point is not a good point
because most people think it should be

4977
02:04:33,851 --> 02:04:37,740
legal and how get good people arguing
half of the people who it should be

4978
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:38,430
illegal,

4979
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:41,550
so you just lose half of the country
right there by making this about that one

4980
02:04:41,551 --> 02:04:42,360
moral issue.

4981
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:44,640
Then you pick out another issue and
then you pick out another issue.

4982
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:45,540
That's another issue.

4983
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:46,350
That's what I'm saying.

4984
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:46,861
That's a good point.

4985
02:04:46,861 --> 02:04:47,970
It marginalizes the whole thing.

4986
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,631
That's a good point,

4987
02:04:48,631 --> 02:04:52,980
but I think there's enough people that
do believe at this point that other

4988
02:04:52,981 --> 02:04:55,860
people are going to have
to start listening because
there's enough people like

4989
02:04:55,861 --> 02:04:57,450
Ron Paul and Gary Johnson,

4990
02:04:57,451 --> 02:05:00,570
intelligent Republicans
that are really pragmatic,

4991
02:05:00,870 --> 02:05:04,390
thoughtful people that can tell
you why it should be legal.

4992
02:05:04,391 --> 02:05:05,250
What does he stand?

4993
02:05:05,251 --> 02:05:07,890
A snowball's chance in hell of being
elected on affecting any change?

4994
02:05:07,891 --> 02:05:08,161
No,

4995
02:05:08,161 --> 02:05:08,401
no,

4996
02:05:08,401 --> 02:05:08,610
no.

4997
02:05:08,610 --> 02:05:10,470
Well affecting change for sure.

4998
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:10,681
You know,

4999
02:05:10,681 --> 02:05:15,681
Ron Paul is probably doing more impact
socially on any other candidate besides

5000
02:05:16,111 --> 02:05:16,860
the people that win.

5001
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:19,020
I absolutely agree that he got
a partial audit of the Fed,

5002
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:21,810
but can you believe that they
put in about what they found out,

5003
02:05:22,230 --> 02:05:26,520
trillions of dollars that were not
accounted for more than our debt over the

5004
02:05:26,521 --> 02:05:27,810
history of this country.

5005
02:05:28,050 --> 02:05:30,240
They lend out without any debates,

5006
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:31,680
without any notification.

5007
02:05:31,681 --> 02:05:36,420
They lend out more money than the history
of the debt of our country to bankers

5008
02:05:36,421 --> 02:05:37,254
to bail them out.

5009
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:38,520
They gave us one amount and it said,

5010
02:05:38,521 --> 02:05:38,671
okay,

5011
02:05:38,671 --> 02:05:39,001
here you go.

5012
02:05:39,001 --> 02:05:39,331
Here you go.

5013
02:05:39,331 --> 02:05:41,520
Bank bail out the countries worldwide.

5014
02:05:41,521 --> 02:05:41,851
Just go.

5015
02:05:41,851 --> 02:05:42,684
Just go.

5016
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:45,180
Most people don't know substantial audit.

5017
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:46,200
Partial order.

5018
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,490
Most people don't even understand.

5019
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:49,620
When you hear about the
Federal Reserve System,

5020
02:05:49,621 --> 02:05:50,454
not federal,

5021
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:53,900
it's a private company and the line is,

5022
02:05:53,901 --> 02:05:55,590
it says federal is Federal Express.

5023
02:05:55,620 --> 02:05:57,900
It's a private company run for profit.

5024
02:05:57,930 --> 02:06:02,340
It's so hard to win some money
that our money is all being,

5025
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:05,710
it's privately handled by foreign banks.

5026
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:06,360
Yeah,

5027
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:07,210
I mean that is a,

5028
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:08,970
that what a mind fuck that is.

5029
02:06:08,971 --> 02:06:13,950
Every dollar that you were here pass off
to earn has already tacked onto it to

5030
02:06:13,951 --> 02:06:15,270
somebody and you don't even know it.

5031
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:20,100
And how is that possible that they
can call it the federal bank when,

5032
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:20,860
I mean what,

5033
02:06:20,860 --> 02:06:21,180
what?

5034
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:22,020
That is crazy.

5035
02:06:22,170 --> 02:06:25,650
That's like calling a company that
breaks into your house movers.

5036
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:26,311
Right.

5037
02:06:26,311 --> 02:06:26,851
You know what I mean?

5038
02:06:26,851 --> 02:06:28,370
It's like how are you calling it that?

5039
02:06:28,390 --> 02:06:29,280
How is that legal,

5040
02:06:29,630 --> 02:06:29,820
you know,

5041
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:32,490
how is it legal to call
that the federal bank,

5042
02:06:32,491 --> 02:06:33,540
the Federal Reserve?

5043
02:06:33,550 --> 02:06:34,383
Because I think they were,

5044
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:36,010
they were reserved for the Fed.

5045
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:37,440
They were the reserve for the federation.

5046
02:06:37,441 --> 02:06:37,681
Right?

5047
02:06:37,681 --> 02:06:37,861
I mean,

5048
02:06:37,861 --> 02:06:38,491
that was what they were.

5049
02:06:38,491 --> 02:06:38,761
They're like,

5050
02:06:38,761 --> 02:06:38,941
well,

5051
02:06:38,941 --> 02:06:39,480
when this,

5052
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:43,800
when this country is in dire straits
or there's a market spike or the next

5053
02:06:43,801 --> 02:06:44,670
depression is going to happen,

5054
02:06:44,671 --> 02:06:46,620
we're going to be there to make
it all right by printing money,

5055
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:48,720
we're going to be the bank that
lends money to the country.

5056
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:52,860
What's amazing is when someone's running
for con for a president and they meet

5057
02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:55,410
with the Bolt Bilderberg
group this out in the open,

5058
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:58,710
they just go and meet with them and you
know they have these fucking meetings

5059
02:06:58,711 --> 02:07:00,510
and it's all I want to chat
with you for a few minutes.

5060
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:01,310
People that road bill,

5061
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:03,330
Bill Clinton running for
president and met with the bill,

5062
02:07:03,331 --> 02:07:04,770
but the vote on that guy,

5063
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:07,230
meanwhile they'd probably
all meet with them.

5064
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:09,690
You know that clearly figuring
out who's the best puppet.

5065
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:10,890
Clearly.

5066
02:07:10,890 --> 02:07:14,490
Has that ever been so frustrating
with Obama right now because the,

5067
02:07:14,530 --> 02:07:16,140
and I hope going to ask you that,

5068
02:07:16,141 --> 02:07:17,370
is it ever been more evident,

5069
02:07:17,970 --> 02:07:19,530
so clear and I was duped.

5070
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:20,700
I was fucking duped.

5071
02:07:20,701 --> 02:07:22,290
I was sold on the hope and change.

5072
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:24,390
And the reason I was
duped was not because,

5073
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:25,170
uh,

5074
02:07:25,170 --> 02:07:25,831
I just,

5075
02:07:25,831 --> 02:07:26,780
I wanted to believe in,

5076
02:07:26,781 --> 02:07:27,690
in the posters,

5077
02:07:27,810 --> 02:07:30,960
but because I looked at where the money
came from and it came from guys like me,

5078
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:32,310
I don't know if it came from you or you,

5079
02:07:32,311 --> 02:07:33,960
but it came from individuals.

5080
02:07:33,961 --> 02:07:35,940
It wasn't so much wonder if it did.

5081
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:37,090
There was some there.

5082
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:38,050
I wonder if it even did,

5083
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:38,291
I mean,

5084
02:07:38,291 --> 02:07:40,390
who the fuck is the auditing where
the money comes from and who's,

5085
02:07:40,510 --> 02:07:43,200
there's a couple of sites that look at
donations and what like and whatnot,

5086
02:07:43,210 --> 02:07:44,990
but that's never happened to me down now.

5087
02:07:45,010 --> 02:07:45,221
I mean,

5088
02:07:45,221 --> 02:07:47,260
there's always back channels
and so for all I know,

5089
02:07:47,261 --> 02:07:47,501
yes,

5090
02:07:47,501 --> 02:07:49,000
the corporations could have
totally put them in there,

5091
02:07:49,001 --> 02:07:51,990
but I know that I donated and I
know a lot of other people donated.

5092
02:07:52,030 --> 02:07:52,421
And so the,

5093
02:07:52,421 --> 02:07:56,740
the sentiment amongst guys like myself
who feel like sheeps now and sentiment

5094
02:07:56,741 --> 02:07:57,190
was,

5095
02:07:57,190 --> 02:07:57,371
hey,

5096
02:07:57,371 --> 02:07:58,570
the people are putting in here.

5097
02:07:58,750 --> 02:08:00,580
So he's got the chance
for the hope and change.

5098
02:08:00,581 --> 02:08:02,170
He's gonna fuck those banks over.

5099
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:03,520
He's going to get us out of those wars.

5100
02:08:03,521 --> 02:08:04,031
Like he said,

5101
02:08:04,031 --> 02:08:04,631
he's going to do this,

5102
02:08:04,631 --> 02:08:05,260
that the other,

5103
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:06,160
and I thought because,

5104
02:08:06,161 --> 02:08:09,280
well my money went to put that there and
so did millions of others of Americans.

5105
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:10,900
He's going to fill beholding to us.

5106
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:12,010
He just escalated.

5107
02:08:12,011 --> 02:08:12,430
Everything,

5108
02:08:12,430 --> 02:08:12,971
escalated,

5109
02:08:12,971 --> 02:08:13,361
everything,

5110
02:08:13,361 --> 02:08:14,860
continued the same policies,

5111
02:08:14,890 --> 02:08:15,101
right?

5112
02:08:15,101 --> 02:08:16,270
Or people are being spied on.

5113
02:08:16,271 --> 02:08:19,510
The never or more of a civil
war rendition is happening.

5114
02:08:19,511 --> 02:08:21,260
Guantanamo is not fucking closed down.

5115
02:08:21,450 --> 02:08:24,430
Fill in wars number that we're
going to close down Guantanamo Bay.

5116
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:24,840
Oh,

5117
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:24,970
it's,

5118
02:08:24,970 --> 02:08:25,250
listen,

5119
02:08:25,250 --> 02:08:26,081
it's a logistics thing.

5120
02:08:26,081 --> 02:08:27,040
We've got an excel spreadsheet.

5121
02:08:27,041 --> 02:08:28,660
It's going to take us like a
year to figure it out guys.

5122
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:29,410
Uh,

5123
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:29,741
no,

5124
02:08:29,741 --> 02:08:31,020
you're not closing that motherfucker down.

5125
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:32,291
You're clearly not.

5126
02:08:32,291 --> 02:08:36,550
And then taking the guys who are
responsible for defrauding the nation,

5127
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:37,960
these guys from JP Morgan,

5128
02:08:37,961 --> 02:08:38,630
from Citibank,

5129
02:08:38,630 --> 02:08:42,430
from a Goldman Sachs or bank of America
and putting them in positions of power

5130
02:08:42,431 --> 02:08:44,350
in positions where they
can control the money.

5131
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:45,970
You put those guys in power,

5132
02:08:45,971 --> 02:08:50,170
the ones that literally fuck this
country by selling faulty mortgages and

5133
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:52,060
betting against their own customers.

5134
02:08:52,150 --> 02:08:52,871
That's crazy.

5135
02:08:52,871 --> 02:08:53,890
She's like betting against them,

5136
02:08:53,891 --> 02:08:55,420
selling you shit in a box,

5137
02:08:55,421 --> 02:08:56,770
putting a triple a
rating on it and saying,

5138
02:08:56,771 --> 02:08:57,011
dude,

5139
02:08:57,011 --> 02:08:57,821
this is so secure.

5140
02:08:57,821 --> 02:08:58,780
You're going to love this shit.

5141
02:08:58,990 --> 02:08:59,261
Oh yeah,

5142
02:08:59,261 --> 02:09:00,670
we bet against it and
now it's going to fail.

5143
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:02,740
You're going to give me
the money to bail me out.

5144
02:09:02,741 --> 02:09:05,050
He put those mother fuckers in his,

5145
02:09:05,170 --> 02:09:05,800
in his cabinet.

5146
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:06,461
I'm happy.

5147
02:09:06,461 --> 02:09:06,821
Don't ask,

5148
02:09:06,821 --> 02:09:07,211
don't tell.

5149
02:09:07,211 --> 02:09:08,044
Got repealed,

5150
02:09:08,050 --> 02:09:11,770
but you got some fucking work to do
and you want the kid that's a crumb.

5151
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:12,963
That's what I mean.

5152
02:09:13,930 --> 02:09:16,420
I had a sign of allowed
to be our hired killer.

5153
02:09:16,421 --> 02:09:17,290
Even if you're gay,

5154
02:09:17,291 --> 02:09:18,124
congratulations.

5155
02:09:18,150 --> 02:09:18,970
The world's perfect man,

5156
02:09:18,970 --> 02:09:19,121
right?

5157
02:09:19,121 --> 02:09:19,251
Yeah.

5158
02:09:19,251 --> 02:09:19,890
We really,

5159
02:09:19,890 --> 02:09:20,800
we need those numbers up.

5160
02:09:21,230 --> 02:09:22,810
We don't need gay people killing people.

5161
02:09:22,811 --> 02:09:24,370
We don't need any new
people killing people.

5162
02:09:24,371 --> 02:09:27,550
I was out at the rally with a sign that
said Wall Street wants to gay Mary,

5163
02:09:27,551 --> 02:09:28,780
you illegal abortions,

5164
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:30,100
and people were like,

5165
02:09:30,101 --> 02:09:31,270
what are you trolling this event?

5166
02:09:31,270 --> 02:09:31,811
What are you doing?

5167
02:09:31,811 --> 02:09:32,081
And I'm like,

5168
02:09:32,081 --> 02:09:32,231
no,

5169
02:09:32,231 --> 02:09:32,350
no,

5170
02:09:32,350 --> 02:09:32,471
no.

5171
02:09:32,471 --> 02:09:35,140
I'm saying that like someone might
see this and get outraged and th the

5172
02:09:35,141 --> 02:09:36,100
statement that I'm trying to make,

5173
02:09:36,101 --> 02:09:37,210
which was woefully missed,

5174
02:09:37,211 --> 02:09:37,930
I get it now,

5175
02:09:37,930 --> 02:09:40,570
but the statement I was trying to make
was that the same anger you have for

5176
02:09:40,571 --> 02:09:41,500
moral issues,

5177
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:45,040
you need to apply to the f the issues
that are the fundamental problems right

5178
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:45,701
now in my opinion,

5179
02:09:45,701 --> 02:09:48,310
it's not those little moral issues
that are on the sign that you are being

5180
02:09:48,311 --> 02:09:49,330
offended by right now.

5181
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:51,610
It's these bankers that
took the fucking money.

5182
02:09:51,611 --> 02:09:53,260
It's the government that's
bought by the bankers.

5183
02:09:53,261 --> 02:09:56,280
It's the police force that's
being paid by them to stifle your,

5184
02:09:56,281 --> 02:09:57,370
your rights to protest.

5185
02:09:57,371 --> 02:09:58,240
It's all that shit.

5186
02:09:58,420 --> 02:10:00,280
Like if that foundation crumbles,

5187
02:10:00,340 --> 02:10:03,310
we won't be able to have the conversations
about the moral shit that you want to

5188
02:10:03,311 --> 02:10:05,590
have a conversation on that
just won't exist anymore.

5189
02:10:05,650 --> 02:10:10,300
I had to read Matt Taibbi these articles
about him to delete this movement even

5190
02:10:10,301 --> 02:10:12,490
though I have to do them 10 fucking times.

5191
02:10:12,491 --> 02:10:16,240
Just even understand you to all the
bullshit that exists behind the scenes

5192
02:10:16,450 --> 02:10:18,590
derivatives and shorting and it's,

5193
02:10:18,591 --> 02:10:23,350
it's so hard to believe that there's an
economy based on gambling that things

5194
02:10:23,351 --> 02:10:28,120
are going to fail and that that is a
hundred times larger than the actual

5195
02:10:28,121 --> 02:10:28,630
economy.

5196
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:29,380
Right?

5197
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:30,520
It's all based on speculation.

5198
02:10:30,790 --> 02:10:32,200
Your fucking head around that.

5199
02:10:32,201 --> 02:10:34,130
It's like I get to bet
a horse in the race.

5200
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:37,670
I get to bet that that horse is it going
to finish the race and I get to put the

5201
02:10:37,671 --> 02:10:38,690
horse in that race.

5202
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:41,780
I know he's not going to finish and I'm
going to tell you this is going to be

5203
02:10:41,781 --> 02:10:42,591
the number one horse.

5204
02:10:42,591 --> 02:10:43,820
You're going to be super secure.

5205
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:44,990
Give that money with me.

5206
02:10:45,110 --> 02:10:45,681
There we go.

5207
02:10:45,681 --> 02:10:49,880
And horse dies on the fucking
first lab and and nobody,

5208
02:10:49,910 --> 02:10:51,060
there's not that sense of savings.

5209
02:10:51,090 --> 02:10:52,280
The savings and loan scandal,

5210
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:54,110
which is a fraction,

5211
02:10:54,230 --> 02:10:56,750
the savings and loan scandal
was a fraction of this,

5212
02:10:56,780 --> 02:10:57,760
this fraud movement.

5213
02:10:58,010 --> 02:11:01,820
Enron was a fraction of it in terms of
detriment to the the the country and

5214
02:11:01,821 --> 02:11:02,391
homes and our,

5215
02:11:02,391 --> 02:11:06,950
and our budgets fraction and not one
person has been investigated or put away

5216
02:11:07,490 --> 02:11:08,170
roses.

5217
02:11:08,170 --> 02:11:10,040
That what a what a disgusting,

5218
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:12,170
weird world we live in.

5219
02:11:12,470 --> 02:11:17,470
We are literally being sucked
dry by financial vampires.

5220
02:11:17,560 --> 02:11:17,900
Yeah.

5221
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:22,130
It's like there's a vampire colony
that's preying on our people,

5222
02:11:22,131 --> 02:11:23,060
but the way they're doing it,

5223
02:11:23,061 --> 02:11:24,350
instead of sucking blood out there,

5224
02:11:24,351 --> 02:11:25,310
sucking money out,

5225
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:30,170
and they live in these opulent castles
that you can go nowhere near and this arm

5226
02:11:30,171 --> 02:11:34,130
guards and fucking fences and they're
sleeping in their coffins and they're just

5227
02:11:34,131 --> 02:11:38,840
socking money out of it and they're
doing it and they're doing it legally.

5228
02:11:38,841 --> 02:11:39,674
Somehow or another,

5229
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:41,270
they're donating money to the cops,

5230
02:11:41,271 --> 02:11:45,050
four point $6 million to the cops so
they can fucking keep them away from them

5231
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,550
while the protests are going on.

5232
02:11:46,790 --> 02:11:47,770
Fuck man.

5233
02:11:47,771 --> 02:11:48,560
Yeah,

5234
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:49,100
it's insane.

5235
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:50,300
Have you ever seen the American dream,

5236
02:11:50,301 --> 02:11:51,350
the animated cartoon?

5237
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:51,830
No.

5238
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:53,990
It explains the Fed
and like a very simple,

5239
02:11:53,991 --> 02:11:55,940
beautiful way inside job
was a great one for that.

5240
02:11:55,941 --> 02:11:58,320
Now people are starting to get aware
of that and side jobs and such.

5241
02:11:58,321 --> 02:11:58,820
I was phenomenal.

5242
02:11:58,820 --> 02:11:59,180
But again,

5243
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:00,980
I had to watch the documentary.

5244
02:12:00,981 --> 02:12:01,370
Yeah,

5245
02:12:01,370 --> 02:12:02,180
exactly.

5246
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:04,970
But how amazing is it when that guy
is questioning all these different

5247
02:12:04,971 --> 02:12:07,250
professors that now these guys,

5248
02:12:07,251 --> 02:12:10,400
they become professors and then they
get jobs working for the government.

5249
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:12,020
So when their professors,

5250
02:12:12,021 --> 02:12:12,561
they say,

5251
02:12:12,561 --> 02:12:12,981
shit,

5252
02:12:12,981 --> 02:12:15,050
that turns out to not
be fucking true at all.

5253
02:12:15,230 --> 02:12:18,680
They say shit that enables businesses
to get away with creepy things because,

5254
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:18,981
well,

5255
02:12:18,981 --> 02:12:20,870
we went to this financial expert in his,

5256
02:12:20,871 --> 02:12:22,040
this is what his opinion is.

5257
02:12:22,190 --> 02:12:22,551
He's like,

5258
02:12:22,551 --> 02:12:22,731
hey,

5259
02:12:22,731 --> 02:12:23,660
everything's going to be cool.

5260
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:24,141
And they're like,

5261
02:12:24,141 --> 02:12:24,321
hey,

5262
02:12:24,321 --> 02:12:25,370
he said everything's going to be cool.

5263
02:12:25,371 --> 02:12:26,240
He's got a phd.

5264
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:28,790
And then it turns out this cock sucker
goes and starts working for the federal

5265
02:12:28,791 --> 02:12:31,760
government afterwards or starts working
for some big corporation afterwards and

5266
02:12:31,761 --> 02:12:33,320
get some cushy ass fucking job.

5267
02:12:33,321 --> 02:12:37,130
It's making x millions of dollars per
year because of his decisions that he made

5268
02:12:37,250 --> 02:12:39,560
that support these
fucking vampire criminals.

5269
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:42,260
It's the same revolving
door with the SEC right now.

5270
02:12:42,350 --> 02:12:45,290
Like the guys were supposed to be
regulating Wall Street and putting cases,

5271
02:12:45,291 --> 02:12:45,591
you know,

5272
02:12:45,591 --> 02:12:47,420
up to the government so they
can actually enforce them.

5273
02:12:47,630 --> 02:12:48,980
They know that if they don't prosecute,

5274
02:12:48,981 --> 02:12:49,880
if they don't do anything,

5275
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:51,140
they're going to be revolving door.

5276
02:12:51,141 --> 02:12:52,400
When they're done with
their two or three years,

5277
02:12:52,401 --> 02:12:55,640
they can hop right on over and work for
the guys that they were supposed to be

5278
02:12:55,641 --> 02:12:56,181
investigating.

5279
02:12:56,181 --> 02:12:57,260
There's no laws against that.

5280
02:12:57,350 --> 02:12:58,183
What's going to happen,

5281
02:12:58,610 --> 02:12:59,690
so this is,

5282
02:12:59,930 --> 02:13:00,980
this is what we all see.

5283
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:02,600
We all see occupy Wall Street,

5284
02:13:02,601 --> 02:13:04,550
we all see people freaking out.

5285
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:07,990
We all see how many people would like
us all across the country mean what does

5286
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:08,151
this,

5287
02:13:08,151 --> 02:13:09,710
this is just a conversation
between Sharon's,

5288
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:12,140
how many friends are sitting
around smoking a joint,

5289
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:12,471
you know,

5290
02:13:12,471 --> 02:13:13,310
drinking a couple beers,

5291
02:13:13,311 --> 02:13:14,990
having the same fucking conversation,

5292
02:13:14,991 --> 02:13:17,960
spitting at each other in a bar
somewhere and these mother fuckers,

5293
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:19,093
what's going to happen?

5294
02:13:19,670 --> 02:13:20,181
Where's this guy?

5295
02:13:20,181 --> 02:13:22,310
It's a great question because
it's more than ever before.

5296
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:24,350
It's more than any time in my life.

5297
02:13:24,980 --> 02:13:25,813
This is like,

5298
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:29,150
we are right now at like
Vietnam protests levels.

5299
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:30,050
We're like,

5300
02:13:30,050 --> 02:13:30,321
we're,

5301
02:13:30,321 --> 02:13:32,190
we're at the state where you see those,

5302
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:36,240
that girl get maced in New York and you
hear that that guy only got fucking 10

5303
02:13:36,241 --> 02:13:38,800
days of vacation time removed from you.

5304
02:13:38,801 --> 02:13:40,920
Like how has that guy
allowed to be a fucking cop?

5305
02:13:41,070 --> 02:13:43,340
You went around and may some chicks you,

5306
02:13:43,350 --> 02:13:44,183
you should be you.

5307
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:46,380
You should have to
fucking fight cris Cyborg.

5308
02:13:46,530 --> 02:13:47,363
That's what they should do.

5309
02:13:47,550 --> 02:13:48,750
This you want to mace chicks.

5310
02:13:48,810 --> 02:13:51,540
How about you getting the right that line
to wake up marine that says there's no

5311
02:13:51,541 --> 02:13:53,320
honor and Pepperdine,

5312
02:13:53,830 --> 02:13:55,410
that marine my gas out.

5313
02:13:55,530 --> 02:13:56,010
It's better.

5314
02:13:56,010 --> 02:13:59,340
Look not against officer Tony
Below and he'll get the job done.

5315
02:14:00,330 --> 02:14:00,601
Totally.

5316
02:14:00,601 --> 02:14:00,961
Baloney.

5317
02:14:00,961 --> 02:14:01,890
Might have a good guard.

5318
02:14:01,891 --> 02:14:02,701
He might get a bill.

5319
02:14:02,701 --> 02:14:03,260
His guard,

5320
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:04,290
a guy off his guard.

5321
02:14:04,291 --> 02:14:07,000
It smells like old spice is going to,

5322
02:14:07,001 --> 02:14:10,530
could it be that strong that gets that
one cop through a sucker punch at one of

5323
02:14:10,531 --> 02:14:13,500
the protestors and it was
like the worst punch ever.

5324
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:19,220
You should never be confident enough to
punch a man with that wack ass technique

5325
02:14:19,591 --> 02:14:20,190
you have.

5326
02:14:20,190 --> 02:14:21,630
You don't know how to fight it all right?

5327
02:14:21,710 --> 02:14:26,130
Yet you have the balls to throw a punch
in a crowd against an unarmed protestor.

5328
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:27,300
You fuckhead,

5329
02:14:27,301 --> 02:14:29,370
which shows just how fucking peaceful,

5330
02:14:29,371 --> 02:14:30,880
despite the agent provocateurs,

5331
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:32,970
it shows just how peaceful
this movement truly is.

5332
02:14:32,971 --> 02:14:34,230
Because that's the only way.

5333
02:14:34,290 --> 02:14:34,471
Well,

5334
02:14:34,471 --> 02:14:37,200
it's also that you see these
cops that are older cops there,

5335
02:14:37,201 --> 02:14:38,280
the white shirt cops,

5336
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:38,701
you know,

5337
02:14:38,701 --> 02:14:42,240
those are the guys that are older cops
that had been the force a long time and

5338
02:14:42,241 --> 02:14:43,800
they get jaded and they get it.

5339
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:45,150
They've seen the worst of humanity.

5340
02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:46,500
You get entitled to,

5341
02:14:46,530 --> 02:14:46,831
you know,

5342
02:14:46,831 --> 02:14:47,530
and they,

5343
02:14:47,530 --> 02:14:49,890
they get cocky and they think that
they can get away with some shit.

5344
02:14:49,891 --> 02:14:50,100
That's,

5345
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:52,080
that's what enabled him to
pull the trigger and put,

5346
02:14:52,110 --> 02:14:52,950
they've also dealt with,

5347
02:14:53,010 --> 02:14:54,750
they've also dealt with
scum day in and day out,

5348
02:14:54,751 --> 02:14:55,260
like you said.

5349
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:57,420
So they see somebody on
their face screaming at them,

5350
02:14:57,421 --> 02:14:58,650
which that should not be happening.

5351
02:14:58,651 --> 02:15:00,150
But they see that and they go,

5352
02:15:00,151 --> 02:15:00,511
okay,

5353
02:15:00,511 --> 02:15:02,160
I'm now identifying us scum right now.

5354
02:15:02,190 --> 02:15:04,050
But we got to when the police over,

5355
02:15:04,110 --> 02:15:05,550
if this thing's gonna work at all.

5356
02:15:05,551 --> 02:15:06,990
And that concerns me,

5357
02:15:06,991 --> 02:15:07,824
that's an uphill battle.

5358
02:15:07,830 --> 02:15:08,101
Oh,

5359
02:15:08,101 --> 02:15:08,934
I don't think so.

5360
02:15:09,130 --> 02:15:09,961
Like I said before,

5361
02:15:09,961 --> 02:15:12,600
I think the cops are gonna figure it
out eventually that it's all a pile of

5362
02:15:12,601 --> 02:15:14,190
horse shit once things start sliding.

5363
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:14,790
I hope so.

5364
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:14,910
Well,

5365
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:17,580
I hope you talked about people that
are willing to commit atrocities,

5366
02:15:17,581 --> 02:15:17,781
right?

5367
02:15:17,781 --> 02:15:18,870
Cause they've been desensitized.

5368
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:20,160
Like they've got enough,

5369
02:15:20,190 --> 02:15:24,360
they've got enough nonlethal arsenal
right now to fuck up a lot of people and

5370
02:15:24,361 --> 02:15:25,950
still feel like they're not being lethal.

5371
02:15:25,951 --> 02:15:26,790
They're just being okay.

5372
02:15:26,791 --> 02:15:27,990
They're just following orders.

5373
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:30,300
They're just worried about
their paycheck as well,

5374
02:15:30,301 --> 02:15:30,630
you know,

5375
02:15:30,630 --> 02:15:31,590
and that that will be said.

5376
02:15:31,590 --> 02:15:32,970
But pepper sprays one thing.

5377
02:15:32,971 --> 02:15:34,470
They've got the sonic weapons,

5378
02:15:34,770 --> 02:15:39,060
they've got fucking rubber bullets like
you look at at at revolts and revolution

5379
02:15:39,061 --> 02:15:39,751
throughout history.

5380
02:15:39,751 --> 02:15:42,930
They never had the weaponry that they
have right now to use against their own

5381
02:15:42,931 --> 02:15:43,560
people.

5382
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:44,880
That's what scares the shit out of me.

5383
02:15:44,910 --> 02:15:47,340
Well that they could flip on a
ray gun and it will microwave.

5384
02:15:47,341 --> 02:15:50,670
Your intestines are so freaky,

5385
02:15:50,671 --> 02:15:51,060
man.

5386
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:51,630
Google it.

5387
02:15:51,630 --> 02:15:53,310
This guide together as Alex Jones.

5388
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:54,000
There's video,

5389
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,140
there's video footage,

5390
02:15:55,170 --> 02:15:57,540
there's video footage from
a news reporter taking a,

5391
02:15:57,700 --> 02:15:57,911
a,

5392
02:15:57,911 --> 02:16:01,110
a a microwave beam weapon
from like 10 years ago.

5393
02:16:01,111 --> 02:16:03,180
Google it right now and he stands
in front of it and was like,

5394
02:16:03,181 --> 02:16:03,331
click,

5395
02:16:03,331 --> 02:16:03,481
click,

5396
02:16:03,481 --> 02:16:03,631
click,

5397
02:16:03,631 --> 02:16:03,781
click,

5398
02:16:03,781 --> 02:16:03,961
click.

5399
02:16:03,961 --> 02:16:04,410
And the guy goes,

5400
02:16:04,410 --> 02:16:04,921
Oh god,

5401
02:16:04,921 --> 02:16:06,930
instantly steps off the pad.

5402
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:08,160
This was from years ago.

5403
02:16:08,190 --> 02:16:11,250
So it's basically like putting
a Mike Rabbit and a microwave.

5404
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:11,700
Yes,

5405
02:16:11,700 --> 02:16:12,630
except it's directional.

5406
02:16:12,631 --> 02:16:12,781
It's,

5407
02:16:12,781 --> 02:16:13,530
it's pinpointed.

5408
02:16:13,530 --> 02:16:15,660
They could point it at you or they
could arch it out and beam and say,

5409
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:16,553
here's the switch.

5410
02:16:16,590 --> 02:16:17,381
Just cooks people.

5411
02:16:17,381 --> 02:16:20,730
You instantly feel like your intestines
are on fire is the way this news

5412
02:16:20,731 --> 02:16:24,790
reporter who stood in front of it years
ago describe it to wearing chain mail,

5413
02:16:25,060 --> 02:16:26,800
male [inaudible] suits.

5414
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:28,133
Metal does.

5415
02:16:28,180 --> 02:16:31,270
Cause like if you put can
of soda in the microwave,

5416
02:16:31,271 --> 02:16:32,110
it will fucking explode.

5417
02:16:32,111 --> 02:16:32,320
Right.

5418
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:33,460
But you can't wear masks.

5419
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:34,600
You can't wear gas masks.

5420
02:16:34,601 --> 02:16:37,210
You can't have sticks anymore for
your sign because that's a weapon.

5421
02:16:37,510 --> 02:16:38,650
You can't have anything anymore.

5422
02:16:38,651 --> 02:16:40,720
So they're going to quell
that shit right away.

5423
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:41,860
You should really watch that video.

5424
02:16:42,790 --> 02:16:43,623
That's a weapon.

5425
02:16:43,810 --> 02:16:44,710
Oh my God.

5426
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:45,430
You know,

5427
02:16:45,430 --> 02:16:48,130
there's a thing that I watched on TV the
other day where they were talking about

5428
02:16:48,131 --> 02:16:49,790
sonic weapons and what they're,

5429
02:16:49,810 --> 02:16:51,940
what they're able to do now with sound,

5430
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,870
they can cause permanent deafness
that can cause permanent blindness.

5431
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:57,880
Have you seen blind you with sound?

5432
02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:01,540
You imagine that there's
a video of that and use,

5433
02:17:01,541 --> 02:17:02,510
I think it's in Detroit,

5434
02:17:02,511 --> 02:17:04,480
it to the Detroit or
Pittsburgh where they roll out.

5435
02:17:04,481 --> 02:17:05,920
There was a small unit protest.

5436
02:17:05,950 --> 02:17:07,710
It's online and it literally announces,

5437
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:08,561
and I'm going to say Detroit,

5438
02:17:08,561 --> 02:17:09,251
I might be wrong on this,

5439
02:17:09,251 --> 02:17:10,031
but I'm just gonna fucking say it.

5440
02:17:10,031 --> 02:17:11,050
The truck rolls out and goes,

5441
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:15,940
our tongue should the city of Detroit
from these giant booming speakers on a big

5442
02:17:15,941 --> 02:17:18,940
black monolithic looking car
with riot police in front of it,

5443
02:17:18,941 --> 02:17:22,360
bashing their shields with
batons to create sound.

5444
02:17:22,420 --> 02:17:22,990
You know,

5445
02:17:22,990 --> 02:17:23,801
and the thing is like,

5446
02:17:23,801 --> 02:17:24,180
I'll turn,

5447
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:26,650
shouldn't we are going
to employ thank you.

5448
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:30,110
Talking about the sonic weapons they
used in Vancouver at the Olympics now

5449
02:17:30,111 --> 02:17:30,791
that's what it was.

5450
02:17:30,791 --> 02:17:31,140
I'm sorry.

5451
02:17:31,140 --> 02:17:32,500
Yeah cause I remembered that.

5452
02:17:32,501 --> 02:17:33,221
I just looked it up,

5453
02:17:33,221 --> 02:17:34,960
but they were threatening
to use things like that.

5454
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:35,793
I believe it was at what?

5455
02:17:36,330 --> 02:17:36,790
No,

5456
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:37,480
they used it.

5457
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:37,690
Yeah.

5458
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:37,931
Well No,

5459
02:17:37,931 --> 02:17:39,520
they use that at the Olympics for sure.

5460
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:39,850
So,

5461
02:17:39,850 --> 02:17:41,890
and that was again years ago and this was,

5462
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:44,560
this was for a nonviolent protest.

5463
02:17:44,890 --> 02:17:46,750
They're calling it an acoustical device.

5464
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:47,561
They said,

5465
02:17:47,561 --> 02:17:48,550
ain't no harmonica.

5466
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:50,030
It's a fucking sound weapon.

5467
02:17:50,031 --> 02:17:52,420
This is a high fidelity dispersal unit.

5468
02:17:52,650 --> 02:17:55,800
What we're going to make you deaf if
you don't get the fuck out of this area.

5469
02:17:55,810 --> 02:18:00,100
They blasted some Somali pirates with
it on this thing that I was watching the

5470
02:18:00,101 --> 02:18:00,220
a,

5471
02:18:00,220 --> 02:18:03,280
the u s government used it
to keep up a Somali pirates.

5472
02:18:03,550 --> 02:18:06,240
They were coming near this boat and
they just turn this thing on him at

5473
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:13,510
[inaudible] and they just fucking blows
their brains out and they have to swim

5474
02:18:13,511 --> 02:18:13,870
away.

5475
02:18:13,870 --> 02:18:15,850
They should have new shit where
it's like in the next 10 minutes,

5476
02:18:15,851 --> 02:18:18,010
we're going to have this thing
that's going to break your iPhone.

5477
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:18,933
I personally,

5478
02:18:19,150 --> 02:18:22,300
I personally like it the way
the fucking Russians handle it.

5479
02:18:22,480 --> 02:18:24,010
The Russians go after Somali pilots.

5480
02:18:24,011 --> 02:18:27,550
They fucking pump missiles into their
boats and they build them up and they

5481
02:18:27,551 --> 02:18:28,600
shoot him in the fucking head.

5482
02:18:28,750 --> 02:18:29,590
That's the way to do it.

5483
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:30,071
You know,

5484
02:18:30,071 --> 02:18:30,311
these,

5485
02:18:30,311 --> 02:18:31,210
these sonic weapons,

5486
02:18:31,211 --> 02:18:31,570
man,

5487
02:18:31,570 --> 02:18:31,931
this is,

5488
02:18:31,931 --> 02:18:33,100
this is some lame shit,

5489
02:18:33,150 --> 02:18:35,920
but that's going to be turned on
you to send regular phone message.

5490
02:18:35,950 --> 02:18:36,600
Yeah,

5491
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:37,450
maybe concerns me.

5492
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:37,881
Yeah.

5493
02:18:37,881 --> 02:18:38,110
And well,

5494
02:18:38,110 --> 02:18:39,190
that's a real concern.

5495
02:18:39,191 --> 02:18:39,431
You know,

5496
02:18:39,431 --> 02:18:39,631
when,

5497
02:18:39,631 --> 02:18:40,660
when technology,

5498
02:18:40,661 --> 02:18:41,350
as far as a,

5499
02:18:41,350 --> 02:18:41,621
you know,

5500
02:18:41,621 --> 02:18:44,230
weapons and shit and riot stuff,

5501
02:18:44,231 --> 02:18:44,441
when,

5502
02:18:44,441 --> 02:18:45,700
when it becomes viable,

5503
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:46,151
you know,

5504
02:18:46,151 --> 02:18:48,820
when it becomes something that
people could make money developing,

5505
02:18:48,821 --> 02:18:49,141
you know,

5506
02:18:49,141 --> 02:18:51,100
and these weapons companies,

5507
02:18:51,101 --> 02:18:52,450
they're going to start
turning it on people.

5508
02:18:52,570 --> 02:18:52,930
Well,

5509
02:18:52,930 --> 02:18:54,310
why else would you build them in by him?

5510
02:18:54,350 --> 02:18:54,520
I mean,

5511
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:54,850
that's,

5512
02:18:54,850 --> 02:18:55,960
that's the last institute.

5513
02:18:55,990 --> 02:18:56,801
Here's what's going to happen,

5514
02:18:56,801 --> 02:18:57,070
right?

5515
02:18:57,070 --> 02:18:58,210
The military industrial complex.

5516
02:18:58,211 --> 02:19:00,250
When you guys think that if
there's money and making more,

5517
02:19:00,370 --> 02:19:02,020
there's also money and keeping peace.

5518
02:19:02,170 --> 02:19:03,070
There's also money and,

5519
02:19:03,110 --> 02:19:06,100
and battling against insurgents
right here in America.

5520
02:19:06,101 --> 02:19:06,311
I mean,

5521
02:19:06,311 --> 02:19:07,570
that's what people are going to be called.

5522
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:09,400
True version of insurgency.

5523
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:09,880
I mean,

5524
02:19:09,880 --> 02:19:10,181
you know,

5525
02:19:10,181 --> 02:19:10,330
the,

5526
02:19:10,330 --> 02:19:12,520
the people that are
rallying up against the,

5527
02:19:12,521 --> 02:19:13,030
you know,

5528
02:19:13,030 --> 02:19:13,291
the,

5529
02:19:13,291 --> 02:19:16,590
the oppressive force and what they're
going to see is what worries about me.

5530
02:19:16,630 --> 02:19:18,310
What worries me about
this is that the imagery,

5531
02:19:18,340 --> 02:19:20,290
like when they shoot people in protests,

5532
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:20,680
right,

5533
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:22,960
and the Arab spring and you see
people just getting fucking Sean,

5534
02:19:22,961 --> 02:19:23,794
you go,

5535
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:24,820
holy shit man,

5536
02:19:24,850 --> 02:19:25,661
that's fucked up.

5537
02:19:25,661 --> 02:19:27,770
And we know got intervene and you get
world support and you get out of the

5538
02:19:27,771 --> 02:19:27,981
people.

5539
02:19:27,981 --> 02:19:32,120
But if they use sonic weapons and
people are angry and protesting finally,

5540
02:19:32,121 --> 02:19:33,200
which it may have to get to,

5541
02:19:33,201 --> 02:19:34,430
I sure fucking hope it doesn't.

5542
02:19:34,430 --> 02:19:36,830
But even if they have an agent
provocateur spark a crowd,

5543
02:19:36,831 --> 02:19:37,161
they're going to say,

5544
02:19:37,161 --> 02:19:37,670
listen,

5545
02:19:37,670 --> 02:19:39,080
these guys got out of hand.

5546
02:19:39,110 --> 02:19:42,080
This protest is violent and angry
and we didn't even kill them.

5547
02:19:42,140 --> 02:19:43,970
We just microwave their
insights for a little bit.

5548
02:19:43,971 --> 02:19:44,750
They won't say that.

5549
02:19:44,750 --> 02:19:46,100
They'll say we use a sonic weapon.

5550
02:19:46,250 --> 02:19:47,450
And so people at home would be like,

5551
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:48,081
well,

5552
02:19:48,081 --> 02:19:49,790
they're being very humane
to those violent people.

5553
02:19:49,791 --> 02:19:51,170
So this isn't nearly as jarring.

5554
02:19:51,171 --> 02:19:54,050
If they were shooting
on 10 people went deaf,

5555
02:19:54,260 --> 02:19:56,270
it was only 10 and they wouldn't listen.

5556
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:57,080
Right?

5557
02:19:57,080 --> 02:19:57,530
They,

5558
02:19:57,530 --> 02:19:57,880
they should.

5559
02:19:57,880 --> 02:19:58,310
Why?

5560
02:19:58,310 --> 02:19:58,911
I had this argument,

5561
02:19:58,911 --> 02:19:59,271
my parents,

5562
02:19:59,271 --> 02:19:59,601
and they're like,

5563
02:19:59,601 --> 02:19:59,900
well,

5564
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:01,400
if the police told you to get out,

5565
02:20:01,610 --> 02:20:03,110
you're not supposed to be there.

5566
02:20:03,330 --> 02:20:05,160
What they told you to leave it?

5567
02:20:05,480 --> 02:20:09,830
I couldn't explain the concept
of protesting to my parents.

5568
02:20:09,860 --> 02:20:11,210
It gets to a certain point,

5569
02:20:11,510 --> 02:20:14,480
it gets to a boiling
point where what happens,

5570
02:20:14,600 --> 02:20:16,130
because it's growing it right now.

5571
02:20:16,130 --> 02:20:18,950
They're saying that every day at
Occupy Wall Street in New York,

5572
02:20:18,951 --> 02:20:21,140
it's a bigger and bigger crowd every day.

5573
02:20:21,141 --> 02:20:24,380
People are coming from all over
the world to participate in it.

5574
02:20:24,670 --> 02:20:25,730
My friend Jamie Kilstein,

5575
02:20:25,731 --> 02:20:27,920
he's doing their fucking Melbourne,

5576
02:20:27,921 --> 02:20:28,754
Australia.

5577
02:20:28,910 --> 02:20:30,620
They're doing occupy Melbourne,

5578
02:20:30,910 --> 02:20:31,230
you know,

5579
02:20:31,230 --> 02:20:33,890
and this is like 10
people fucking hippies.

5580
02:20:35,010 --> 02:20:35,843
They're out there.

5581
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:37,520
10 MPs in Australia might,

5582
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:40,870
but they're talking to
bankers might know they're a,

5583
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:41,121
yeah,

5584
02:20:41,121 --> 02:20:41,631
they're out there.

5585
02:20:41,631 --> 02:20:42,260
But I mean it's,

5586
02:20:42,260 --> 02:20:44,570
it's giant fucking Ganti.

5587
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:46,100
It's beyond gigantic.

5588
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:47,840
So what does it do?

5589
02:20:47,990 --> 02:20:48,321
What do you,

5590
02:20:48,321 --> 02:20:48,720
what is,

5591
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:49,760
when you look at it,

5592
02:20:49,790 --> 02:20:50,330
do you,

5593
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:53,300
do you extrapolate on constantly,

5594
02:20:53,330 --> 02:20:53,540
you know,

5595
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:55,280
there's a million ways this thing can go,

5596
02:20:55,281 --> 02:20:56,720
which is why I'm so fascinated by it.

5597
02:20:56,721 --> 02:21:00,500
I mean we are living in a chapter of a
future history book or we're living at

5598
02:21:00,501 --> 02:21:01,610
the end of our society.

5599
02:21:01,650 --> 02:21:03,500
I mean you don't know.

5600
02:21:03,530 --> 02:21:04,130
Maybe both.

5601
02:21:04,130 --> 02:21:04,640
Maybe both.

5602
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,030
Yeah.

5603
02:21:05,030 --> 02:21:06,380
Maybe this is new world order shit.

5604
02:21:06,381 --> 02:21:08,900
Maybe this is when the crowd gets
completely beat down and that's it.

5605
02:21:08,901 --> 02:21:09,561
There's nothing you can do.

5606
02:21:09,561 --> 02:21:10,850
We just be slaves to the system.

5607
02:21:10,910 --> 02:21:12,860
Did you see Ron Paul at
the Republican debate?

5608
02:21:12,890 --> 02:21:13,280
Yeah.

5609
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:16,520
Ron Paul had this one brilliant thing
that he said that everybody says that

5610
02:21:16,550 --> 02:21:18,080
really pays attention to human history.

5611
02:21:18,081 --> 02:21:18,471
He said,

5612
02:21:18,471 --> 02:21:22,730
this is exactly how every
single empire has fallen.

5613
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:27,620
They try to spread themselves out too
thin and eventually it all comes crumbling

5614
02:21:27,621 --> 02:21:28,070
down.

5615
02:21:28,070 --> 02:21:28,903
Yeah.

5616
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:29,960
It's amazing.

5617
02:21:29,961 --> 02:21:30,920
We have a blueprint.

5618
02:21:30,921 --> 02:21:31,551
We've seen this.

5619
02:21:31,551 --> 02:21:35,420
We have the knowledge to connect all the
dots as to what's happening right now

5620
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:38,500
and yet we're just repeating history but
with slightly different tools and it's

5621
02:21:38,501 --> 02:21:39,470
slightly different volumes.

5622
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:39,920
You know?

5623
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:43,640
It's been ratcheted up and we've
survived a lot of that history.

5624
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:45,860
But who knows what atrocities could line,

5625
02:21:46,020 --> 02:21:46,250
you know,

5626
02:21:46,250 --> 02:21:46,940
lie around the corner.

5627
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:48,980
But I even looking at it
like I'm doing all right,

5628
02:21:49,190 --> 02:21:50,120
I've got a good job,

5629
02:21:50,330 --> 02:21:51,290
I've got great friends,

5630
02:21:51,291 --> 02:21:52,190
like I'm doing great.

5631
02:21:52,191 --> 02:21:55,310
And I see I'm really concerned
for the director of this country,

5632
02:21:55,311 --> 02:21:58,640
which is why I'm trying to educate myself
and be a little more outspoken about

5633
02:21:58,641 --> 02:21:58,701
it.

5634
02:21:58,701 --> 02:22:01,430
But I'm really concerned to the point
where I've had the discussion of,

5635
02:22:01,460 --> 02:22:01,671
all right,

5636
02:22:01,671 --> 02:22:02,270
well where the fuck,

5637
02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:03,350
where's our exit strategy?

5638
02:22:03,860 --> 02:22:04,693
What is it right now?

5639
02:22:05,180 --> 02:22:08,660
If the shit really hits the fan tomorrow
and they declare martial law and the

5640
02:22:08,661 --> 02:22:09,680
streets lockdown,

5641
02:22:09,950 --> 02:22:10,161
you know,

5642
02:22:10,161 --> 02:22:12,230
the riot police are coming into the
marines going to come in and fight.

5643
02:22:12,231 --> 02:22:13,280
Am I going to wake up tomorrow morning,

5644
02:22:13,281 --> 02:22:14,150
my dollars worth nothing.

5645
02:22:14,151 --> 02:22:15,680
And there's a war zone outside my window.

5646
02:22:16,130 --> 02:22:16,820
I mean we're,

5647
02:22:16,820 --> 02:22:17,001
we're,

5648
02:22:17,001 --> 02:22:19,220
we're potentially two to
three years away from that.

5649
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:20,300
Maybe more.

5650
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:21,133
Who knows what that's,

5651
02:22:21,410 --> 02:22:23,840
maybe it could happen tomorrow.

5652
02:22:23,841 --> 02:22:24,220
And,

5653
02:22:24,220 --> 02:22:26,220
and that the notion that it could happen,

5654
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:26,971
not that I think it will,

5655
02:22:26,971 --> 02:22:28,110
but the notion that it could,

5656
02:22:28,290 --> 02:22:31,230
I never thought I would feel that
in my lifetime in this country.

5657
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:33,180
And I feel it right now
and I've been researching,

5658
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:34,200
do I go to Finland,

5659
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:34,980
Switzerland?

5660
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:35,161
I mean,

5661
02:22:35,161 --> 02:22:37,390
Japan was my exit strategy
for a little while there.

5662
02:22:37,460 --> 02:22:38,101
I love Japan,

5663
02:22:38,101 --> 02:22:40,410
but that countries had some
fucking hard times right now.

5664
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:42,000
And you wouldn't go to Canada?

5665
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:43,600
I would go right to Vancouver.

5666
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:44,910
Vancouver is a shit.

5667
02:22:45,270 --> 02:22:47,990
I've never been to Vancouver off is it?

5668
02:22:48,210 --> 02:22:49,350
You ever done shows up?

5669
02:22:49,490 --> 02:22:50,010
But yeah,

5670
02:22:50,010 --> 02:22:50,810
maybe times me.

5671
02:22:50,810 --> 02:22:51,150
Yeah.

5672
02:22:51,150 --> 02:22:51,720
Dude.

5673
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:52,710
Vancouver first of all,

5674
02:22:52,950 --> 02:22:55,170
well there re a mass Borys comedy scene.

5675
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:55,891
Great.

5676
02:22:55,891 --> 02:22:58,530
We'd rape women are
nice people and really,

5677
02:22:58,531 --> 02:22:58,920
um,

5678
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:01,410
a really diverse community.

5679
02:23:01,490 --> 02:23:02,520
I all sorts of different there.

5680
02:23:02,521 --> 02:23:03,880
Now I should got to be there.

5681
02:23:04,380 --> 02:23:07,500
I almost moved there in
1984 when Bush won again,

5682
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:08,701
not an 84,

5683
02:23:08,701 --> 02:23:10,860
rather 2004 when Bush won again in 2004.

5684
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:13,710
I just sat back and especially because
I was paying attention to the whole

5685
02:23:13,711 --> 02:23:15,060
Diebold voting thing.

5686
02:23:15,140 --> 02:23:15,370
Right.

5687
02:23:15,370 --> 02:23:16,203
You know the whole,

5688
02:23:16,530 --> 02:23:17,041
I was like,

5689
02:23:17,041 --> 02:23:18,030
this is ridiculous.

5690
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:20,820
I watched the hacking democracy
documentary and I'm like,

5691
02:23:20,821 --> 02:23:21,271
these guys,

5692
02:23:21,271 --> 02:23:21,901
they stole it.

5693
02:23:21,901 --> 02:23:22,734
This is not about,

5694
02:23:22,890 --> 02:23:23,910
this is not real anymore.

5695
02:23:24,290 --> 02:23:28,140
Stover testifying under oath that he
wrote code that allowed them to rig an

5696
02:23:28,141 --> 02:23:32,640
election and we showed how we can be
done in Dene did it and showed how this,

5697
02:23:32,641 --> 02:23:33,391
there's a,

5698
02:23:33,391 --> 02:23:36,780
there's a third party option in the
software that allows a third party other

5699
02:23:36,781 --> 02:23:38,760
than the voter other than the
PR person reading the vote.

5700
02:23:39,150 --> 02:23:40,020
A second person,

5701
02:23:40,050 --> 02:23:43,560
another person comes in and inserts data
and changes the data and they showed

5702
02:23:43,561 --> 02:23:44,394
how it can be done.

5703
02:23:44,430 --> 02:23:45,050
And this is,

5704
02:23:45,050 --> 02:23:48,630
I mean this has been massive
contributors to the Republican Party.

5705
02:23:48,810 --> 02:23:52,320
The idea that some company can contribute
to the Republican Party and then make

5706
02:23:52,321 --> 02:23:55,680
a machine that decides whether
Republicans or Democrats win elections.

5707
02:23:55,710 --> 02:23:56,730
Is it madness?

5708
02:23:56,910 --> 02:23:58,040
Absolute fucking man.

5709
02:23:58,041 --> 02:23:59,280
It's called hedging your bets.

5710
02:23:59,310 --> 02:24:00,360
I got furious man.

5711
02:24:00,361 --> 02:24:00,691
There was a,

5712
02:24:00,691 --> 02:24:02,630
there was a period of time
over a couple of weeks.

5713
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:03,990
I'm a big fan of Candida.

5714
02:24:03,991 --> 02:24:06,030
I love going up there and I
don't like the cold though.

5715
02:24:06,290 --> 02:24:06,691
And I was like,

5716
02:24:06,691 --> 02:24:06,871
man,

5717
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:07,860
Montreal would be the shit,

5718
02:24:07,861 --> 02:24:08,730
but the winters are brutal.

5719
02:24:08,731 --> 02:24:09,181
Fuck,

5720
02:24:09,181 --> 02:24:10,080
where else could I live?

5721
02:24:10,100 --> 02:24:10,410
Right.

5722
02:24:10,410 --> 02:24:10,680
You know,

5723
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:11,700
maybe you have that thought.

5724
02:24:12,460 --> 02:24:13,081
I still do.

5725
02:24:13,081 --> 02:24:14,070
I still go back and forth.

5726
02:24:14,071 --> 02:24:15,160
I have my friend Bobby lives up.

5727
02:24:15,161 --> 02:24:15,511
So what's it,

5728
02:24:15,511 --> 02:24:16,650
what's going to be the pin drop?

5729
02:24:16,690 --> 02:24:18,210
Do you imagine what the candles,

5730
02:24:18,211 --> 02:24:18,751
I get older.

5731
02:24:18,751 --> 02:24:21,870
It might just because as I get older
I just decide enough is enough of this

5732
02:24:21,871 --> 02:24:22,291
nonsense.

5733
02:24:22,291 --> 02:24:23,520
You don't have to live in this country.

5734
02:24:23,700 --> 02:24:23,941
You know?

5735
02:24:23,941 --> 02:24:24,450
This is a,

5736
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:28,800
we are eventually
becoming a global society.

5737
02:24:28,830 --> 02:24:29,100
We,

5738
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:32,820
the connectivity that we all enjoy right
now because of the Internet lets people

5739
02:24:32,821 --> 02:24:35,110
realize that communities like my,

5740
02:24:35,140 --> 02:24:35,973
my message board,

5741
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:39,600
I have a massive message board and in
this community is a mass as a message

5742
02:24:39,601 --> 02:24:41,430
board of really cool
people from everywhere.

5743
02:24:41,430 --> 02:24:41,611
Man,

5744
02:24:41,611 --> 02:24:43,410
I have people from fucking Saudi Arabia.

5745
02:24:43,620 --> 02:24:45,210
I have people from foreign countries,

5746
02:24:45,211 --> 02:24:46,290
I have Asian countries,

5747
02:24:46,291 --> 02:24:47,730
I have people from Canada,

5748
02:24:47,731 --> 02:24:49,260
a lot of fucking people from Canada,

5749
02:24:49,261 --> 02:24:52,440
people from Switzerland and
Sweden all over the fucking world.

5750
02:24:52,650 --> 02:24:56,970
And it leads me to believe that this
idea that a fucking line in the dirt can

5751
02:24:56,971 --> 02:24:58,290
dictate where you're from.

5752
02:24:58,520 --> 02:24:58,761
No,

5753
02:24:58,761 --> 02:24:58,920
no,

5754
02:24:58,920 --> 02:24:59,001
no,

5755
02:24:59,001 --> 02:24:59,161
no.

5756
02:24:59,161 --> 02:25:01,440
It should be likeminded people.

5757
02:25:01,470 --> 02:25:02,430
It should be cool people,

5758
02:25:02,431 --> 02:25:03,870
like minded people find them.

5759
02:25:03,871 --> 02:25:04,980
And if you find a spot,

5760
02:25:05,190 --> 02:25:05,341
oh,

5761
02:25:05,341 --> 02:25:06,540
it's across the dirt line.

5762
02:25:06,541 --> 02:25:07,470
It's no good anymore.

5763
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:07,741
Yeah.

5764
02:25:07,741 --> 02:25:08,401
But it's awesome.

5765
02:25:08,401 --> 02:25:10,170
Whether it's fucking Costa Rica or where,

5766
02:25:10,171 --> 02:25:11,580
where are the fuck it is?

5767
02:25:11,790 --> 02:25:14,900
If you find a place that you
think that you could live a safer,

5768
02:25:14,970 --> 02:25:15,450
healthier,

5769
02:25:15,450 --> 02:25:18,090
friendlier life than
what you're here in the,

5770
02:25:18,091 --> 02:25:19,500
in the center of the Shit Storm.

5771
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:19,860
You know,

5772
02:25:19,860 --> 02:25:20,210
look,

5773
02:25:20,210 --> 02:25:22,170
I love the idea of America.

5774
02:25:22,171 --> 02:25:23,310
I love the idea.

5775
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:24,160
It all,

5776
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:25,240
I love the idea that,

5777
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:25,541
you know,

5778
02:25:25,541 --> 02:25:29,050
we saved the world from the Russians and
we saved the world from the Nazis and

5779
02:25:29,051 --> 02:25:29,770
that we're,

5780
02:25:29,770 --> 02:25:30,101
you know,

5781
02:25:30,101 --> 02:25:30,311
the,

5782
02:25:30,311 --> 02:25:30,611
the,

5783
02:25:30,611 --> 02:25:32,110
the noblest and most creative.

5784
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:32,891
I love the idea,

5785
02:25:32,891 --> 02:25:35,980
but I don't see it in
practice and it scares me.

5786
02:25:35,981 --> 02:25:37,540
I don't want to have been
to a fucking car game.

5787
02:25:38,340 --> 02:25:39,173
It's not a game.

5788
02:25:39,420 --> 02:25:39,740
It's,

5789
02:25:39,740 --> 02:25:41,130
it scares me to think that I'm,

5790
02:25:41,860 --> 02:25:42,820
that I'm a rube,

5791
02:25:43,090 --> 02:25:43,391
you know,

5792
02:25:43,391 --> 02:25:47,140
that I'm locked into this stupid
fucking system and if it gets any worse,

5793
02:25:47,141 --> 02:25:47,974
man,

5794
02:25:48,070 --> 02:25:48,790
I don't know what to do.

5795
02:25:48,790 --> 02:25:51,850
And that's why it falls apart
around it is the catalyst,

5796
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:52,090
you know?

5797
02:25:52,090 --> 02:25:53,560
And that's what I've been
thinking because you know,

5798
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:57,340
people had chances to get out of
countries that became locked down and war

5799
02:25:57,341 --> 02:25:58,300
started and then it was like,

5800
02:25:58,301 --> 02:25:58,451
yeah,

5801
02:25:58,451 --> 02:25:59,320
you ain't going anywhere.

5802
02:25:59,530 --> 02:26:00,220
They had,

5803
02:26:00,220 --> 02:26:01,000
they had signs.

5804
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:01,630
They had,

5805
02:26:01,630 --> 02:26:02,800
they had news reports coming out.

5806
02:26:02,801 --> 02:26:03,401
They had all that shit.

5807
02:26:03,401 --> 02:26:04,660
They didn't have the answer net though.

5808
02:26:04,661 --> 02:26:05,770
They didn't have the Internet.

5809
02:26:05,771 --> 02:26:06,290
They didn't.

5810
02:26:06,290 --> 02:26:07,270
It was a different world.

5811
02:26:07,350 --> 02:26:11,680
A world that we're living in is a very
strange world and I don't know what

5812
02:26:11,681 --> 02:26:13,570
happens when it all falls apart.

5813
02:26:13,810 --> 02:26:14,650
I don't know.

5814
02:26:14,750 --> 02:26:17,650
It was someone going to
try to reclaim power.

5815
02:26:17,770 --> 02:26:18,041
I mean,

5816
02:26:18,041 --> 02:26:19,990
is there going to be
an actual physical war?

5817
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:21,340
Are they going to be tanks in the streets?

5818
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:22,720
And who are those soldiers?

5819
02:26:22,721 --> 02:26:25,270
Those soldiers are going to actually
go after their brothers and sisters and

5820
02:26:25,271 --> 02:26:26,290
cousins and neighbors.

5821
02:26:27,780 --> 02:26:28,300
How can,

5822
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:29,133
how can they,

5823
02:26:29,170 --> 02:26:29,651
how can they,

5824
02:26:29,651 --> 02:26:30,520
is that possible?

5825
02:26:30,910 --> 02:26:33,960
I mean they could be sold a message that
it's not their brothers and sisters and

5826
02:26:33,961 --> 02:26:34,610
neighbors,

5827
02:26:34,610 --> 02:26:35,580
that it's insurgents,

5828
02:26:35,650 --> 02:26:38,170
that they're terrorists and that
would be the agent provocateur.

5829
02:26:38,171 --> 02:26:41,640
So we need a certain population associate
pass and make this whole fucking prime

5830
02:26:41,650 --> 02:26:42,483
work for the man.

5831
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:44,410
We're going to become
Mexicans won't be going on.

5832
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:45,253
You were saying,

5833
02:26:45,280 --> 02:26:46,640
you're saying that the agent provocateur,

5834
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:47,680
yeah,

5835
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,270
we will be the Canadian Mexicans,

5836
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:49,740
right,

5837
02:26:49,740 --> 02:26:50,270
exactly.

5838
02:26:50,270 --> 02:26:51,400
Mexican versions of Canada.

5839
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:52,541
Yeah.

5840
02:26:52,541 --> 02:26:53,860
I'd rather live in a cold climate.

5841
02:26:53,861 --> 02:26:54,940
I might even live in Alaska.

5842
02:26:54,941 --> 02:26:57,010
I might even live in Alaska
better than this show.

5843
02:26:57,011 --> 02:26:58,930
Have you seen this fish
with the transparent head?

5844
02:26:59,110 --> 02:27:01,080
Have you ever seen this photo yet?

5845
02:27:01,450 --> 02:27:01,730
Yeah,

5846
02:27:01,730 --> 02:27:03,400
it's like a real deep underwater fish.

5847
02:27:03,900 --> 02:27:07,720
It's a fish and they have it on youtube
or there's photos it's on from national

5848
02:27:07,721 --> 02:27:08,261
geographic,

5849
02:27:08,261 --> 02:27:11,980
but it's actual fish that you can
just see right into its brain and,

5850
02:27:12,010 --> 02:27:15,670
and like you could see its
organs and the name of it.

5851
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:16,390
Um,

5852
02:27:16,390 --> 02:27:17,223
I think it,

5853
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:20,080
they call it a large Pacific,

5854
02:27:21,730 --> 02:27:22,511
B a.

5855
02:27:22,511 --> 02:27:25,990
R.

5856
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:25,990
R.

5857
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:25,990
E.

5858
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:25,990
L.

5859
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:25,990
E.

5860
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:25,990
Y.

5861
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:25,990
E.

5862
02:27:25,990 --> 02:27:26,860
Borrowell borrow I,

5863
02:27:27,220 --> 02:27:28,690
this is a video from a few years ago.

5864
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:31,820
This was like 2009 I just
saw it the other day.

5865
02:27:31,820 --> 02:27:34,000
It's like the fish from Sega
semen for the Dreamcast.

5866
02:27:34,060 --> 02:27:34,660
Yes,

5867
02:27:34,660 --> 02:27:35,290
exactly.

5868
02:27:35,290 --> 02:27:37,270
Like that fit fucking alien world.

5869
02:27:37,271 --> 02:27:37,870
That ocean,

5870
02:27:37,870 --> 02:27:41,560
I always see a real deep water
shit like the planet earth,

5871
02:27:41,590 --> 02:27:42,490
deep water addition,

5872
02:27:42,491 --> 02:27:43,420
anything on deep water.

5873
02:27:43,421 --> 02:27:48,160
I see the life that exists on this planet
and it makes me realize how uncreative

5874
02:27:48,161 --> 02:27:50,800
human beings are at conceiving
what alien life forms could be.

5875
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:52,000
You know what I mean?

5876
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:53,890
It's like this fish glows in the dark.

5877
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:54,101
Yeah.

5878
02:27:54,101 --> 02:27:57,880
You probably didn't think of this fish
only exist in the infrared spectrum.

5879
02:27:58,570 --> 02:28:00,190
An Angler fish develop.

5880
02:28:00,370 --> 02:28:01,870
How the fuck did that fish develop?

5881
02:28:01,871 --> 02:28:04,630
It has a fishing rod and as
efficient rod and allure,

5882
02:28:04,870 --> 02:28:09,260
it dangles a little lore and as the
thing comes closed or fucking giant mall

5883
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:10,930
opens up and sucks the fishing,

5884
02:28:11,230 --> 02:28:13,180
it's amazing because
it was created by some,

5885
02:28:13,240 --> 02:28:15,160
it was created by some
alien point and clicks.

5886
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:15,701
You know what I mean?

5887
02:28:15,701 --> 02:28:17,260
We are just their simulator and he's like,

5888
02:28:17,261 --> 02:28:17,861
let's try this.

5889
02:28:17,861 --> 02:28:20,500
A fish with a fucking lure on
its head and see where that goes.

5890
02:28:20,530 --> 02:28:22,460
There's this who's a chess master

5891
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:26,630
and he's a brilliant guy who plays
blindfolded chess against like multiple

5892
02:28:26,631 --> 02:28:27,464
opponents.

5893
02:28:27,470 --> 02:28:30,590
It's Australian guy and
he's also a creationist.

5894
02:28:30,591 --> 02:28:33,650
It's a really fascinating thing to
see because he's obviously a super,

5895
02:28:33,651 --> 02:28:37,370
super brilliant guy and so many posted
this a interview with this guy where he

5896
02:28:37,371 --> 02:28:39,890
was talking about how there's a,

5897
02:28:40,040 --> 02:28:43,490
what science doesn't account for with
evolution doesn't account for it.

5898
02:28:43,491 --> 02:28:45,770
How does carbon molecule become a person?

5899
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:46,060
You know?

5900
02:28:46,060 --> 02:28:47,210
And it's just the,

5901
02:28:47,270 --> 02:28:48,290
and their idea.

5902
02:28:48,291 --> 02:28:51,020
It's like this idea of the
soul and all these different,

5903
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:51,791
it's the,

5904
02:28:51,791 --> 02:28:54,410
the complexity is too
hard for them to grasp,

5905
02:28:54,411 --> 02:28:55,400
so it must be magic,

5906
02:28:55,430 --> 02:28:55,760
right?

5907
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:57,950
It gets to some weird in due time,

5908
02:28:57,951 --> 02:29:01,340
science will help us perceive what
we have to label as magic right now.

5909
02:29:01,341 --> 02:29:02,174
And maybe,

5910
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:02,780
maybe,

5911
02:29:02,780 --> 02:29:03,321
maybe not.

5912
02:29:03,321 --> 02:29:05,460
I mean maybe that's the question
we're not supposed to ever answer.

5913
02:29:05,461 --> 02:29:08,030
Well maybe we'll get to a
certain point where we realized,

5914
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:08,541
oh no,

5915
02:29:08,541 --> 02:29:12,440
there is some sort of an inner code that's
in escapable that that permeates the

5916
02:29:12,441 --> 02:29:13,310
entire universe.

5917
02:29:13,310 --> 02:29:13,461
You know,

5918
02:29:13,461 --> 02:29:15,680
whatever it's string theory
or whatever the fuck it is.

5919
02:29:15,681 --> 02:29:16,040
They,

5920
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:19,130
they find some frequency
at the center of all that,

5921
02:29:19,131 --> 02:29:19,371
you know,

5922
02:29:19,371 --> 02:29:23,510
accepts love and rejects negativity
or video and that contact signal.

5923
02:29:24,530 --> 02:29:25,363
Yes,

5924
02:29:25,880 --> 02:29:26,480
no,

5925
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:27,140
no,

5926
02:29:27,140 --> 02:29:27,321
no.

5927
02:29:27,321 --> 02:29:28,220
It'd be different than that.

5928
02:29:28,221 --> 02:29:28,870
They heard the signal,

5929
02:29:28,870 --> 02:29:29,151
they're like,

5930
02:29:29,151 --> 02:29:30,260
and then the blind dude was like,

5931
02:29:30,261 --> 02:29:30,531
dude,

5932
02:29:30,531 --> 02:29:31,251
I hear video.

5933
02:29:31,251 --> 02:29:33,310
And then they put it up to a
monitor and it was Hitler and,

5934
02:29:33,311 --> 02:29:33,601
and he's like,

5935
02:29:33,601 --> 02:29:34,011
there's more.

5936
02:29:34,011 --> 02:29:35,270
This is interlaced information.

5937
02:29:35,290 --> 02:29:37,130
And they had the blueprints on
how to build the travel thing.

5938
02:29:37,131 --> 02:29:38,180
It's exactly like that.

5939
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:39,340
That was a fascinating movie.

5940
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:40,520
Wasn't book was way better.

5941
02:29:40,580 --> 02:29:40,940
It wasn't,

5942
02:29:40,940 --> 02:29:42,290
I never read the book was a way better.

5943
02:29:42,291 --> 02:29:43,760
I'll say it again was a bad motherfucker,

5944
02:29:43,850 --> 02:29:44,540
by the way.

5945
02:29:44,540 --> 02:29:46,670
Massive pothead for those of you.

5946
02:29:46,671 --> 02:29:46,901
Hey,

5947
02:29:46,901 --> 02:29:47,270
we'd,

5948
02:29:47,270 --> 02:29:47,991
Carl Sagan,

5949
02:29:47,991 --> 02:29:49,280
huge pothead,

5950
02:29:49,490 --> 02:29:52,790
Carl Sagan smoked weed every fucking day.

5951
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:54,920
It's just a age son.

5952
02:29:54,921 --> 02:29:55,810
See Dr Drew,

5953
02:29:55,820 --> 02:29:58,250
I was talking about g on
the Conan O'brien show,

5954
02:29:58,820 --> 02:30:00,050
which is cool by the way,

5955
02:30:00,051 --> 02:30:04,790
that that not only as the California
association backed up medical marijuana,

5956
02:30:04,910 --> 02:30:06,980
but Dr Jay was Ancona and being asked,

5957
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:09,130
do you backup medical marijuana?

5958
02:30:09,900 --> 02:30:10,371
And he says,

5959
02:30:10,371 --> 02:30:10,521
well,

5960
02:30:10,521 --> 02:30:12,860
I get a lot of slack from
Joe Rogan about this.

5961
02:30:12,861 --> 02:30:17,861
And the reason why is because he started
talking on his crazy CNN show about how

5962
02:30:20,481 --> 02:30:25,481
marijuana is much stronger than it was
back in the day and how there's dangerous

5963
02:30:26,751 --> 02:30:28,460
withdrawal symptoms.

5964
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:29,241
And I'm like,

5965
02:30:29,241 --> 02:30:30,140
come on man.

5966
02:30:30,150 --> 02:30:32,840
Did he clarify that it might
be cycled purely psychological?

5967
02:30:32,910 --> 02:30:34,050
This is always,

5968
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:34,910
you know,

5969
02:30:34,910 --> 02:30:36,500
I don't know how your body works,

5970
02:30:36,770 --> 02:30:38,930
but I'm pretty sure that if we'd got ya,

5971
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:40,520
it's cause we'd got there first.

5972
02:30:40,550 --> 02:30:40,780
Well,

5973
02:30:40,780 --> 02:30:42,950
I mean if it wasn't we'd
that you got addicted to,

5974
02:30:42,951 --> 02:30:47,400
it could have been cheated or scratch
tickets or Internet porn whenever plugs it

5975
02:30:47,401 --> 02:30:47,940
up.

5976
02:30:47,940 --> 02:30:48,320
Yeah.

5977
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:49,910
And maybe for some people there's,

5978
02:30:49,911 --> 02:30:54,650
there's people that have extreme
physical issues with all sorts of,

5979
02:30:54,700 --> 02:30:54,890
uh,

5980
02:30:54,890 --> 02:30:56,120
altered states of consciousness.

5981
02:30:56,270 --> 02:30:59,390
There's people that literally
must drink coffee all day long.

5982
02:30:59,391 --> 02:31:00,920
They must smoke cigarettes all day long.

5983
02:31:00,921 --> 02:31:03,320
They are constantly trying
to change whatever state.

5984
02:31:03,510 --> 02:31:05,000
And it could be an imbalance.

5985
02:31:05,001 --> 02:31:06,530
It could be some sort of
an issue that they have.

5986
02:31:06,570 --> 02:31:09,320
I have witnessed it and
many times with alcohol,

5987
02:31:09,440 --> 02:31:11,600
I know a certain people with drugs.

5988
02:31:11,750 --> 02:31:12,081
You know,

5989
02:31:12,081 --> 02:31:13,880
I was listening to Ron Bennington,

5990
02:31:13,881 --> 02:31:15,740
I was listening to Ron and Fez and,

5991
02:31:15,741 --> 02:31:15,891
uh,

5992
02:31:15,891 --> 02:31:19,980
Ron is a guy who's a in the
program and he apparently he had

5993
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:24,300
a appendix and they wanted to give him
pain killer pills and he was terrified

5994
02:31:24,330 --> 02:31:26,370
and he's pretty sure he's got
as addictions under control,

5995
02:31:26,430 --> 02:31:27,780
but he didn't want to take the chance.

5996
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:28,320
And,

5997
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:28,590
uh,

5998
02:31:28,590 --> 02:31:32,730
one of the reasons why is because he had
a friend and this friend I believe you

5999
02:31:32,731 --> 02:31:35,700
said had been sober for 10 fucking years,

6000
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:40,290
had been working as a counselor in
a place helping people stay sober,

6001
02:31:40,350 --> 02:31:43,590
stayed up in the Poconos so that he
didn't have to go back around the same

6002
02:31:43,591 --> 02:31:44,381
neighborhood and be around.

6003
02:31:44,381 --> 02:31:45,910
This was working it as hard as you could.

6004
02:31:45,911 --> 02:31:46,744
It's there for 10 years,

6005
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:48,370
gets it in some sort of an accident.

6006
02:31:48,371 --> 02:31:49,111
It has a back problem,

6007
02:31:49,111 --> 02:31:49,441
whatever.

6008
02:31:49,441 --> 02:31:50,430
They put them on some pills,

6009
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:50,881
boom.

6010
02:31:50,881 --> 02:31:51,571
He's a junkie gun.

6011
02:31:51,571 --> 02:31:51,960
Yeah.

6012
02:31:51,960 --> 02:31:52,651
There's some people,

6013
02:31:52,651 --> 02:31:52,861
man,

6014
02:31:52,861 --> 02:31:53,640
there's some people in,

6015
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:54,480
there's no doubt about it.

6016
02:31:54,481 --> 02:31:55,800
And I would never discount that.

6017
02:31:55,800 --> 02:31:57,330
I would never discount that possibility.

6018
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:59,400
But what they discount,

6019
02:31:59,401 --> 02:32:01,470
and this is my issue with
all these doctor drew types,

6020
02:32:01,471 --> 02:32:02,820
is that they always have this sort of,

6021
02:32:02,821 --> 02:32:03,110
uh,

6022
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:04,680
an I love doctor true by the way.

6023
02:32:04,681 --> 02:32:05,580
He's a really good guy.

6024
02:32:05,610 --> 02:32:05,821
Yeah.

6025
02:32:05,821 --> 02:32:06,241
He's a great guy.

6026
02:32:06,241 --> 02:32:06,751
He's a great guy.

6027
02:32:06,751 --> 02:32:07,830
I really love him as a person.

6028
02:32:07,831 --> 02:32:08,640
He's a,

6029
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:09,690
there's nothing wrong with that guy.

6030
02:32:09,691 --> 02:32:10,710
He gets silly sometimes,

6031
02:32:10,980 --> 02:32:11,820
but they,

6032
02:32:11,850 --> 02:32:14,820
they discount the positive benefits of it.

6033
02:32:14,821 --> 02:32:17,010
And they make it as if it's a goof.

6034
02:32:17,130 --> 02:32:18,780
They make it like they go like,

6035
02:32:18,900 --> 02:32:19,311
well,

6036
02:32:19,311 --> 02:32:19,771
I listen.

6037
02:32:19,771 --> 02:32:22,680
I'm not going to stop you from
smoking pot if you want a small pot,

6038
02:32:22,860 --> 02:32:25,950
forget about all the medical uses because
the medical uses are many and they're

6039
02:32:25,951 --> 02:32:27,390
very varied in the very real,

6040
02:32:27,930 --> 02:32:32,930
the actual benefits of it for
the human race are substantial,

6041
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:33,570
right?

6042
02:32:33,570 --> 02:32:37,020
They're huge and they're not something
you should just dismiss and diminish

6043
02:32:37,170 --> 02:32:41,730
because popular opinion is laced with
the propaganda from 19 fucking thirties

6044
02:32:41,731 --> 02:32:45,510
and it has just in intwined itself into
our culture to the point where people

6045
02:32:45,511 --> 02:32:49,830
believe all sorts of bullshit and
nonsense about what is really an amazing

6046
02:32:49,831 --> 02:32:50,970
beneficial plant.

6047
02:32:51,110 --> 02:32:51,390
You know,

6048
02:32:51,390 --> 02:32:53,760
and maybe you can handle it
and maybe you don't like it,

6049
02:32:53,761 --> 02:32:55,650
but to tell me that this thing,

6050
02:32:55,651 --> 02:32:57,810
this turbo charger for the imagination,

6051
02:32:57,960 --> 02:33:00,960
this thing that makes you more sensitive
and makes you more loving and makes you

6052
02:33:00,961 --> 02:33:01,711
more friendly,

6053
02:33:01,711 --> 02:33:02,820
it makes food taste better,

6054
02:33:02,910 --> 02:33:03,511
make sex,

6055
02:33:03,511 --> 02:33:04,230
tastes better.

6056
02:33:04,230 --> 02:33:05,520
It doesn't harm you in any way.

6057
02:33:05,521 --> 02:33:06,331
You wake up in the morning,

6058
02:33:06,331 --> 02:33:07,350
you fucking feel great.

6059
02:33:07,351 --> 02:33:08,840
You don't feel hung over you.

6060
02:33:08,850 --> 02:33:11,730
You're telling me that this thing
that I take in that does this is bad.

6061
02:33:11,970 --> 02:33:14,700
I'm telling you it could
fix the fucking world.

6062
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:16,830
I'm telling you what
changes consciousness.

6063
02:33:16,950 --> 02:33:17,461
I'm telling you.

6064
02:33:17,461 --> 02:33:18,480
It's a fucking tool,

6065
02:33:18,481 --> 02:33:19,020
man.

6066
02:33:19,020 --> 02:33:22,930
It's a tool like a hammer or a
fucking jackhammer or or or or,

6067
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,270
or a laser beam.

6068
02:33:24,271 --> 02:33:28,830
It's anything I'll do you think he
fundamentally think that he needs what the

6069
02:33:28,831 --> 02:33:30,450
world needs is a showman.

6070
02:33:30,450 --> 02:33:31,320
They need Sharman.

6071
02:33:31,440 --> 02:33:35,040
They need people who have experienced
altered states of consciousness and not

6072
02:33:35,041 --> 02:33:36,510
only know how to navigate them,

6073
02:33:36,570 --> 02:33:39,750
can talk other people through them
and do it on a professional level.

6074
02:33:39,900 --> 02:33:43,080
What they've done for thousands and
thousands of years in the rain forest,

6075
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:45,810
we need to apply not just with marijuana,

6076
02:33:45,811 --> 02:33:49,050
but all the different tools of
consciousness including alcohol,

6077
02:33:49,260 --> 02:33:52,080
should have places with a
teach you how to drink alcohol.

6078
02:33:52,230 --> 02:33:53,700
I enjoy alcohol.

6079
02:33:53,701 --> 02:33:54,331
I like it.

6080
02:33:54,331 --> 02:33:55,980
I like having a shot
or two with my friends.

6081
02:33:56,130 --> 02:33:57,390
It makes me loose.

6082
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:58,650
It makes me silly.

6083
02:33:58,710 --> 02:33:59,121
I get,

6084
02:33:59,121 --> 02:33:59,231
I,

6085
02:33:59,231 --> 02:34:01,230
I start enjoying things a little bit more.

6086
02:34:01,231 --> 02:34:02,130
I want to dance.

6087
02:34:02,220 --> 02:34:03,210
I don't think it's bad,

6088
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:06,690
but I think there would be
benefit so many fucking people.

6089
02:34:06,691 --> 02:34:11,040
If when you're 19 or 20 they took you
to a fucking class where some smart,

6090
02:34:11,041 --> 02:34:14,910
interesting person taught
you about drinking and give
you some fucking things to

6091
02:34:14,911 --> 02:34:15,660
think about.

6092
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:16,710
Here's what you need to think about.

6093
02:34:16,850 --> 02:34:17,080
Well,

6094
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:18,490
why don't you write down,

6095
02:34:18,610 --> 02:34:19,210
how about this?

6096
02:34:19,210 --> 02:34:19,481
You're a,

6097
02:34:19,481 --> 02:34:20,350
you're a new drinker.

6098
02:34:20,380 --> 02:34:21,490
Write down your iPhone.

6099
02:34:21,491 --> 02:34:23,140
Every time you have a drink is that hard?

6100
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:24,700
Send yourself a text message.

6101
02:34:24,760 --> 02:34:28,240
Send a friend a text message every time
you have a drink and he has to send you

6102
02:34:28,241 --> 02:34:31,660
a text message every time he has
a drink so that you get like six,

6103
02:34:31,661 --> 02:34:33,070
seven drinks in from this guy.

6104
02:34:33,310 --> 02:34:34,300
You can call him up and go,

6105
02:34:34,301 --> 02:34:34,631
hey bro,

6106
02:34:34,631 --> 02:34:35,530
you should stop drinking.

6107
02:34:35,770 --> 02:34:39,220
[inaudible] you texted me 45 minutes
ago and you've had nine drinks.

6108
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:40,181
Who the fuck are you doing?

6109
02:34:40,181 --> 02:34:40,811
Who's watching you?

6110
02:34:40,811 --> 02:34:40,991
Who's,

6111
02:34:40,991 --> 02:34:41,140
uh,

6112
02:34:41,140 --> 02:34:41,951
who's looking out for you?

6113
02:34:41,951 --> 02:34:42,790
Who's driving you home?

6114
02:34:43,030 --> 02:34:43,300
You know,

6115
02:34:43,300 --> 02:34:44,050
that's not a bad idea.

6116
02:34:44,050 --> 02:34:44,201
Yeah,

6117
02:34:44,201 --> 02:34:46,430
you're teaching social
responsibility with what's available.

6118
02:34:46,450 --> 02:34:46,830
Teach.

6119
02:34:46,830 --> 02:34:48,400
It's its social responsibility,

6120
02:34:48,401 --> 02:34:50,080
but it's also shamanism.

6121
02:34:50,270 --> 02:34:50,801
The got it.

6122
02:34:50,801 --> 02:34:53,330
But the idea of beating disagrees with it.

6123
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:53,441
No,

6124
02:34:53,441 --> 02:34:53,571
no,

6125
02:34:53,571 --> 02:34:53,710
no.

6126
02:34:53,710 --> 02:34:54,310
He does it.

6127
02:34:54,310 --> 02:34:58,430
We actually had yesterday that we went
through all the entire stuff that Dr drew

6128
02:34:58,431 --> 02:35:00,880
has said about marijuana all in a row.

6129
02:35:00,881 --> 02:35:02,390
And we ended up with a white,

6130
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:03,460
he said on Conan,

6131
02:35:03,790 --> 02:35:04,271
and he,

6132
02:35:04,271 --> 02:35:08,350
he's actually saying that that one of
the biggest things right now is that

6133
02:35:08,351 --> 02:35:10,150
there's people that get
addicted to marijuana.

6134
02:35:10,151 --> 02:35:12,700
Marijuana is addictive to people and that,

6135
02:35:12,730 --> 02:35:14,620
and then if you look at physically though,

6136
02:35:14,621 --> 02:35:15,040
dude,

6137
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:15,821
it's addictive.

6138
02:35:15,821 --> 02:35:17,140
Like jerking lofts addictive,

6139
02:35:17,470 --> 02:35:17,801
right?

6140
02:35:17,801 --> 02:35:18,340
But the,

6141
02:35:18,340 --> 02:35:22,030
one of the biggest things right now that's
filling a hospital room or hospitals

6142
02:35:22,031 --> 02:35:23,140
and stuff like that is people,

6143
02:35:23,360 --> 02:35:23,740
you know,

6144
02:35:23,740 --> 02:35:26,290
freaking out on marijuana and
stuff like that and that you have,

6145
02:35:26,350 --> 02:35:27,183
one of the things,

6146
02:35:27,540 --> 02:35:31,220
the hospital room people having panic
attacks and going to hospitals is,

6147
02:35:31,750 --> 02:35:33,900
but it's big and they want to say in that,

6148
02:35:33,910 --> 02:35:34,743
cause that I'd happen to him,

6149
02:35:35,360 --> 02:35:38,320
he got pull over to the side of
the road and call an ambulance.

6150
02:35:38,320 --> 02:35:39,011
But that's not true.

6151
02:35:39,011 --> 02:35:40,210
That's 100% not true.

6152
02:35:40,740 --> 02:35:41,040
Well,

6153
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:41,501
here's actually,

6154
02:35:41,501 --> 02:35:42,670
it wasn't high at all when it happened,

6155
02:35:42,730 --> 02:35:44,110
but here's the thing,

6156
02:35:44,150 --> 02:35:46,750
it drew has to say this could happen.

6157
02:35:46,860 --> 02:35:47,591
It has to do as a,

6158
02:35:47,591 --> 02:35:48,424
as a physician.

6159
02:35:48,660 --> 02:35:49,070
What he,

6160
02:35:49,070 --> 02:35:52,220
what he's saying that that's one of
his biggest things that he treats his,

6161
02:35:52,221 --> 02:35:54,430
his medical marijuana Dixon.

6162
02:35:54,431 --> 02:35:59,170
So what he was saying is
that it is addictive too
because people do get addicted

6163
02:35:59,171 --> 02:36:00,850
because he has to deal
with it all the time.

6164
02:36:01,030 --> 02:36:03,880
Now he's saying he's
for medical marijuana.

6165
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:04,691
He says that,

6166
02:36:04,691 --> 02:36:07,030
that especially now that after this thing,

6167
02:36:07,060 --> 02:36:07,840
but that,

6168
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:08,680
but to Joe's point there,

6169
02:36:08,681 --> 02:36:10,220
it is addictive though.

6170
02:36:10,270 --> 02:36:11,590
If there was a showman,

6171
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:14,920
whether it's yourself or doctor drew
or the fucking Internet that said,

6172
02:36:14,921 --> 02:36:15,370
hey,

6173
02:36:15,370 --> 02:36:16,690
this can be addictive.

6174
02:36:16,691 --> 02:36:17,441
Here's what happens.

6175
02:36:17,441 --> 02:36:19,900
Instead of it's either going to be
reefer madness or it's the greatest thing

6176
02:36:19,901 --> 02:36:20,051
ever.

6177
02:36:20,051 --> 02:36:20,231
I mean,

6178
02:36:20,231 --> 02:36:21,180
you need to balance the approach.

6179
02:36:21,181 --> 02:36:21,971
You need to educate people.

6180
02:36:21,971 --> 02:36:26,971
I think we all know somebody that spends
over $40 a day on marijuana probably.

6181
02:36:27,341 --> 02:36:27,470
Yeah,

6182
02:36:27,470 --> 02:36:31,980
I know a few people that fucking just
go to the store and just fucking spend a

6183
02:36:31,981 --> 02:36:33,570
shitload of money every single day.

6184
02:36:33,760 --> 02:36:34,810
Smokes that money.

6185
02:36:34,930 --> 02:36:36,490
This is misses the current study.

6186
02:36:36,491 --> 02:36:40,390
The current study believe they believe
that 10% of recreational users will

6187
02:36:40,391 --> 02:36:43,750
develop problems severe enough to
impair their work and relationships.

6188
02:36:44,140 --> 02:36:45,010
Very simple.

6189
02:36:45,130 --> 02:36:48,940
Take the money that they
would make from taxes,

6190
02:36:48,970 --> 02:36:50,470
from marijuana if it was legal.

6191
02:36:50,471 --> 02:36:51,220
I've always said,

6192
02:36:51,220 --> 02:36:52,750
if you want to have marijuana illegal,

6193
02:36:52,760 --> 02:36:53,620
just how about this?

6194
02:36:53,770 --> 02:36:55,270
You want to give people an incentive,

6195
02:36:55,360 --> 02:36:59,410
make it tax it higher than everything
else tat give it a tax like Dee did to

6196
02:36:59,411 --> 02:37:00,280
cigarettes or alcohol,

6197
02:37:00,340 --> 02:37:00,520
right?

6198
02:37:00,520 --> 02:37:04,900
To give it a attacks and then take a
portion of that and use it for treatment

6199
02:37:04,901 --> 02:37:09,901
centers for these 10% that have wacky
fucking genes or whatever it is,

6200
02:37:10,380 --> 02:37:10,490
right?

6201
02:37:10,490 --> 02:37:11,080
It's not,

6202
02:37:11,080 --> 02:37:12,250
but for most of us,

6203
02:37:12,251 --> 02:37:13,690
it's not physically addictive,

6204
02:37:13,780 --> 02:37:16,310
but a lot of people like to escape man,

6205
02:37:16,311 --> 02:37:19,790
and they like this escape with video
games and if they don't escape with video

6206
02:37:19,791 --> 02:37:20,001
games,

6207
02:37:20,001 --> 02:37:20,870
they like the escape with weed.

6208
02:37:21,020 --> 02:37:24,620
I had been addicted to things before
that aren't addictive like video games.

6209
02:37:24,770 --> 02:37:26,030
I've been addicted to playing pool.

6210
02:37:26,031 --> 02:37:27,260
I've been addicted to working out.

6211
02:37:27,261 --> 02:37:31,250
I've been addicted to several things
in my life that were impulses,

6212
02:37:31,340 --> 02:37:32,060
masturbation,

6213
02:37:32,060 --> 02:37:34,820
I've had moments in my life
special and as a young man were,

6214
02:37:34,821 --> 02:37:35,091
you know,

6215
02:37:35,091 --> 02:37:35,811
you'd masturbate.

6216
02:37:35,811 --> 02:37:37,010
Like how many of you ever done that?

6217
02:37:37,011 --> 02:37:37,371
Like master,

6218
02:37:37,371 --> 02:37:38,120
when you don't even Horny,

6219
02:37:38,120 --> 02:37:40,460
meanwhile you're beaten off like for
the third or fourth time in the day.

6220
02:37:40,500 --> 02:37:41,750
Like what the fuck is wrong with me?

6221
02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:47,390
There's a difference I think between
when you have a fucked up life and you,

6222
02:37:47,420 --> 02:37:50,990
you don't have discipline
and you don't have like,

6223
02:37:51,390 --> 02:37:52,130
uh,

6224
02:37:52,130 --> 02:37:54,680
the ability to be
objective about your body,

6225
02:37:54,790 --> 02:37:56,840
you'd be able to ability to
be objective about your mind.

6226
02:37:56,870 --> 02:37:58,940
How much organization have you done?

6227
02:37:58,941 --> 02:37:59,990
Do you do meditation?

6228
02:37:59,991 --> 02:38:02,420
Do you do any self reflecting time?

6229
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:06,030
Will you sit down and look at
your whole life as a whole?

6230
02:38:06,260 --> 02:38:06,381
Well,

6231
02:38:06,381 --> 02:38:06,980
if you don't,

6232
02:38:06,980 --> 02:38:11,090
then sometimes you get washed up in
some crazy wave of momentum and then you

6233
02:38:11,091 --> 02:38:12,230
become obsessive with things.

6234
02:38:12,231 --> 02:38:13,064
At least me,

6235
02:38:13,070 --> 02:38:14,300
I find myself,

6236
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:14,880
uh,

6237
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:18,470
my most vulnerable when the rest of my
life is out of order and chaotic when the

6238
02:38:18,471 --> 02:38:19,820
rest of my life is like a bunch of shit.

6239
02:38:19,821 --> 02:38:21,680
And I'm not dealing with fucking bills.

6240
02:38:21,681 --> 02:38:22,514
I'm not paying and all that.

6241
02:38:22,550 --> 02:38:24,860
That's when I'll find myself
beating off three times a day.

6242
02:38:24,950 --> 02:38:28,190
That's when I find myself can't walk
away from the computer because I want to

6243
02:38:28,191 --> 02:38:29,630
fucking play video games online.

6244
02:38:29,631 --> 02:38:32,240
All all you smoke more during
those periods though or no,

6245
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:33,800
I don't do any of that anymore.

6246
02:38:33,850 --> 02:38:37,610
And all this was back before I even
smoked weed and smoke weed anymore.

6247
02:38:37,850 --> 02:38:38,121
Yeah,

6248
02:38:38,121 --> 02:38:38,954
I stopped,

6249
02:38:39,050 --> 02:38:40,760
stopped so that can have
guns and those guns.

6250
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:41,160
Yeah.

6251
02:38:41,160 --> 02:38:41,340
You know,

6252
02:38:41,340 --> 02:38:41,961
I want to keep my guns.

6253
02:38:41,961 --> 02:38:42,794
I made a decision.

6254
02:38:43,770 --> 02:38:46,340
She con con fucking government.

6255
02:38:46,341 --> 02:38:47,150
You can't.

6256
02:38:47,150 --> 02:38:48,710
When I actually got pulled over,

6257
02:38:49,110 --> 02:38:49,640
I love it.

6258
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:50,600
I love the good ones.

6259
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:51,261
Don't get me wrong.

6260
02:38:51,261 --> 02:38:52,600
I love a good cots Joe.

6261
02:38:52,601 --> 02:38:53,840
When I got off the good cops,

6262
02:38:53,841 --> 02:38:54,710
when I pulled over,

6263
02:38:54,750 --> 02:38:55,431
that was an accident.

6264
02:38:55,431 --> 02:38:55,641
Weed,

6265
02:38:55,641 --> 02:38:56,480
that was caffeine.

6266
02:38:56,481 --> 02:38:58,250
That was from energy drinks from,

6267
02:38:58,340 --> 02:38:58,730
from,

6268
02:38:58,730 --> 02:39:02,030
that was the gay climbing out
of every pore in your body.

6269
02:39:02,450 --> 02:39:02,840
Like,

6270
02:39:02,840 --> 02:39:03,341
like the,

6271
02:39:03,341 --> 02:39:07,190
the center was a nuclear reactor and it
was melting down and the gay was just

6272
02:39:07,191 --> 02:39:11,420
blasting out of all your skin pores and
you were twitching and shaking and you

6273
02:39:11,421 --> 02:39:12,254
had to call the cops.

6274
02:39:12,440 --> 02:39:13,273
How many energy drinks?

6275
02:39:13,860 --> 02:39:14,250
Uh,

6276
02:39:14,250 --> 02:39:15,950
I had one of those big mountain dew.

6277
02:39:15,951 --> 02:39:17,030
I don't think they make them anymore.

6278
02:39:17,570 --> 02:39:18,530
Mungus mountain dew.

6279
02:39:18,531 --> 02:39:19,500
Super Energy.

6280
02:39:19,501 --> 02:39:20,630
You've got a bucket of energy.

6281
02:39:20,630 --> 02:39:21,590
Drink a straw on it.

6282
02:39:21,650 --> 02:39:22,670
And I hadn't eaten all day.

6283
02:39:22,680 --> 02:39:24,200
My heart start double jumping.

6284
02:39:24,201 --> 02:39:25,790
We had a girl at our e three booth.

6285
02:39:25,791 --> 02:39:27,020
We had these a booth models.

6286
02:39:27,021 --> 02:39:28,700
We were sponsored by first of all,

6287
02:39:28,940 --> 02:39:29,773
fuck yeah,

6288
02:39:30,040 --> 02:39:30,390
no.

6289
02:39:30,390 --> 02:39:31,570
And they were and they
were all as I've been,

6290
02:39:32,350 --> 02:39:33,183
this is not a,

6291
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:33,571
uh,

6292
02:39:33,571 --> 02:39:34,610
an unnatural,

6293
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:36,260
not even a mildly attractive girl.

6294
02:39:36,261 --> 02:39:37,094
There.

6295
02:39:37,110 --> 02:39:38,290
E three is ridiculous.

6296
02:39:38,300 --> 02:39:41,440
There are some really hot nerd chicks
there that really are into that shit.

6297
02:39:41,630 --> 02:39:42,770
Favorite smoking hot.

6298
02:39:42,780 --> 02:39:44,990
What is hotter than a hot chick
with a hot body in glasses?

6299
02:39:44,991 --> 02:39:45,801
I don't know what it is,

6300
02:39:45,801 --> 02:39:46,140
man.

6301
02:39:46,140 --> 02:39:46,550
I said,

6302
02:39:46,550 --> 02:39:46,911
Sarah,

6303
02:39:46,911 --> 02:39:47,510
painful event.

6304
02:39:47,510 --> 02:39:48,291
You got his glasses,

6305
02:39:48,291 --> 02:39:48,531
girl.

6306
02:39:48,531 --> 02:39:49,100
I love her.

6307
02:39:49,100 --> 02:39:49,521
She's great.

6308
02:39:49,521 --> 02:39:50,321
Like vision impairments.

6309
02:39:50,321 --> 02:39:50,631
She was like,

6310
02:39:50,631 --> 02:39:50,961
no,

6311
02:39:50,961 --> 02:39:52,160
she was a gamestop manager.

6312
02:39:52,930 --> 02:39:56,570
Like that level of nurturing and plays
professor Layton and cause plays.

6313
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:57,990
My girlfriend.

6314
02:39:57,990 --> 02:39:58,823
She works.

6315
02:39:59,150 --> 02:39:59,983
Yeah,

6316
02:40:00,200 --> 02:40:01,610
go to get them to workout.

6317
02:40:01,940 --> 02:40:02,721
This is very important.

6318
02:40:02,721 --> 02:40:07,721
Some girls are great when they're like
2122 2023 and 24 it starts becoming

6319
02:40:08,150 --> 02:40:11,330
gelatinous and gives
out and that's so sad.

6320
02:40:11,420 --> 02:40:13,740
You can keep it down like 19 is that's,

6321
02:40:13,741 --> 02:40:13,980
that's

6322
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:14,101
it.

6323
02:40:14,101 --> 02:40:14,910
That's the cutoff point.

6324
02:40:14,910 --> 02:40:18,270
We need to find out what the Fuck Halle
Berry's doing cause that bitch is 45 and

6325
02:40:18,271 --> 02:40:19,260
she's hot shed.

6326
02:40:19,590 --> 02:40:23,840
Do you think there's a lot on lasers and
surgery and scissors and now health and

6327
02:40:23,850 --> 02:40:24,683
healthy eating,

6328
02:40:24,790 --> 02:40:26,220
which is crazy.

6329
02:40:26,280 --> 02:40:26,780
I don't know.

6330
02:40:26,780 --> 02:40:28,960
I haven't seen her in
Pc Demi Moore lately.

6331
02:40:29,170 --> 02:40:29,390
No.

6332
02:40:29,390 --> 02:40:30,000
Whoa.

6333
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:30,840
She showed them a picture.

6334
02:40:30,870 --> 02:40:35,050
They showed a picture of her a yesterday
where she looks like a skeleton like

6335
02:40:35,460 --> 02:40:39,600
and she just looks like whatever magic
she was using for the last 20 years.

6336
02:40:40,410 --> 02:40:41,243
They finally caught up.

6337
02:40:43,380 --> 02:40:45,240
This is going to take
more Mona but fuck it.

6338
02:40:45,241 --> 02:40:46,680
I'm going to catch this sexy style

6339
02:40:49,550 --> 02:40:51,690
like Charlie Sheen's penis.

6340
02:40:51,691 --> 02:40:51,930
Now,

6341
02:40:51,930 --> 02:40:54,630
if you look at him and you can't
blame Ashton crashed and ran,

6342
02:40:55,020 --> 02:40:57,540
you can't blame Ashton for going
out and getting some on the side.

6343
02:40:57,541 --> 02:40:57,990
You can't,

6344
02:40:57,990 --> 02:41:00,000
do you think that's had an
open relationship though?

6345
02:41:00,010 --> 02:41:00,530
Like I heard it.

6346
02:41:00,530 --> 02:41:01,111
That's totally allowed,

6347
02:41:01,111 --> 02:41:03,450
but he just picked women that were
being vocal about it and it was like,

6348
02:41:03,460 --> 02:41:03,690
I don't,

6349
02:41:03,690 --> 02:41:04,350
can't do this anymore.

6350
02:41:04,350 --> 02:41:04,580
Now.

6351
02:41:04,580 --> 02:41:05,300
Well,

6352
02:41:05,300 --> 02:41:06,110
um,

6353
02:41:06,110 --> 02:41:07,880
let me see how I can phrase this.

6354
02:41:07,950 --> 02:41:08,720
No,

6355
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:13,310
I have a friend and this friend may or
may not have worked on the movie Gi Jane

6356
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:14,780
[inaudible] and uh,

6357
02:41:14,781 --> 02:41:16,880
you know that movie to me more than it.

6358
02:41:17,150 --> 02:41:19,370
This friend who may or may
not have worked on this,

6359
02:41:19,371 --> 02:41:21,830
may or may not have had to
me grab his cock one night,

6360
02:41:21,980 --> 02:41:22,813
ted Danson.

6361
02:41:23,270 --> 02:41:23,890
No.

6362
02:41:23,890 --> 02:41:24,001
Well,

6363
02:41:24,001 --> 02:41:24,834
good try.

6364
02:41:24,950 --> 02:41:27,140
So if that was possible,

6365
02:41:27,141 --> 02:41:28,250
if that was real,

6366
02:41:28,790 --> 02:41:29,623
yes.

6367
02:41:29,630 --> 02:41:31,520
I think that might very well way street.

6368
02:41:31,580 --> 02:41:33,710
I think it was probably
together in Gi Jane.

6369
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:34,200
No,

6370
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:34,510
no.

6371
02:41:34,510 --> 02:41:35,540
But Bruce Willis,

6372
02:41:36,480 --> 02:41:37,313
that's probably,

6373
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:39,110
there's a lot of people
that roll that way.

6374
02:41:39,111 --> 02:41:39,944
They just roll that way,

6375
02:41:39,960 --> 02:41:42,050
especially in the acting community does,

6376
02:41:42,070 --> 02:41:42,620
you know,

6377
02:41:42,620 --> 02:41:43,310
people think that,

6378
02:41:43,310 --> 02:41:44,060
oh,

6379
02:41:44,060 --> 02:41:45,080
they're no different than us.

6380
02:41:45,740 --> 02:41:46,730
Many of them know,

6381
02:41:46,760 --> 02:41:47,541
but many of them,

6382
02:41:47,541 --> 02:41:50,360
they've grown up in these
weird fucking Showbiz,

6383
02:41:50,480 --> 02:41:53,320
super self indulgent circles and you know,

6384
02:41:53,330 --> 02:41:54,170
many of them just,

6385
02:41:54,171 --> 02:41:54,411
you know,

6386
02:41:54,411 --> 02:41:55,010
they're kind of,

6387
02:41:55,010 --> 02:41:58,160
they didn't do drugs and they
embrace different lifestyles and,

6388
02:41:58,161 --> 02:41:58,994
you know,

6389
02:42:00,530 --> 02:42:04,060
have you ever done the open relationship
thing or the thing or anything or you

6390
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:04,520
tried it?

6391
02:42:04,520 --> 02:42:05,001
No,

6392
02:42:05,001 --> 02:42:05,820
I've never tried it.

6393
02:42:05,820 --> 02:42:06,950
[inaudible] I mean,

6394
02:42:07,160 --> 02:42:10,040
obviously I've been in situations
where I didn't want to be settled down,

6395
02:42:10,540 --> 02:42:10,850
you know,

6396
02:42:10,850 --> 02:42:11,271
and I said,

6397
02:42:11,271 --> 02:42:11,421
look,

6398
02:42:11,421 --> 02:42:11,611
I don't,

6399
02:42:11,611 --> 02:42:13,400
I don't want to be in a relationship.

6400
02:42:13,401 --> 02:42:13,910
I don't want to,

6401
02:42:13,910 --> 02:42:16,020
but I've never been in like you.

6402
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:17,390
Yeah,

6403
02:42:17,390 --> 02:42:17,620
yeah,

6404
02:42:17,620 --> 02:42:17,781
yeah.

6405
02:42:17,781 --> 02:42:18,070
We,

6406
02:42:18,070 --> 02:42:19,780
we have a buddy Ari Shaffir who,

6407
02:42:19,781 --> 02:42:20,060
uh,

6408
02:42:20,060 --> 02:42:25,040
was in an open marriage and his wife
would go on dates and then come home and

6409
02:42:25,041 --> 02:42:27,500
talk about how guys fucked her and stuff.

6410
02:42:28,130 --> 02:42:29,560
He should really do material on that.

6411
02:42:29,610 --> 02:42:30,411
Why doesn't he do material?

6412
02:42:30,411 --> 02:42:30,561
Yeah.

6413
02:42:30,561 --> 02:42:31,281
He's weird about that,

6414
02:42:31,281 --> 02:42:31,890
right?

6415
02:42:31,890 --> 02:42:32,211
I don't think,

6416
02:42:32,211 --> 02:42:32,810
maybe he doesn't want it.

6417
02:42:32,810 --> 02:42:33,643
The world.

6418
02:42:36,410 --> 02:42:37,430
You're talking about Ted Danson.

6419
02:42:37,510 --> 02:42:38,060
Yeah.

6420
02:42:38,060 --> 02:42:38,541
Not Ours.

6421
02:42:38,541 --> 02:42:40,130
Fear that guy who looks like Ari Shaffir.

6422
02:42:40,230 --> 02:42:41,210
Was he getting off to it?

6423
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:42,513
They were the thing.

6424
02:42:43,620 --> 02:42:44,221
I don't know man.

6425
02:42:44,221 --> 02:42:44,461
You know,

6426
02:42:44,461 --> 02:42:45,690
you'd have to ask him about that.

6427
02:42:45,691 --> 02:42:46,670
I don't want to say no.

6428
02:42:47,010 --> 02:42:48,420
I already said too much as it is.

6429
02:42:48,450 --> 02:42:49,480
I think he said it before.

6430
02:42:49,490 --> 02:42:49,610
Yeah.

6431
02:42:49,610 --> 02:42:49,880
Yes,

6432
02:42:49,880 --> 02:42:50,130
I did.

6433
02:42:50,130 --> 02:42:50,341
Before.

6434
02:42:50,341 --> 02:42:51,390
I wouldn't have said
if you hadn't said it,

6435
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:52,081
but he,

6436
02:42:52,081 --> 02:42:53,340
he's crazy or he's crazy,

6437
02:42:53,341 --> 02:42:53,641
you know,

6438
02:42:53,641 --> 02:42:55,380
or ours wild motherfucker though.

6439
02:42:55,381 --> 02:42:55,741
You know,

6440
02:42:55,741 --> 02:42:55,971
our,

6441
02:42:55,971 --> 02:42:56,804
he will,

6442
02:42:57,090 --> 02:42:57,570
you know,

6443
02:42:57,570 --> 02:42:59,100
what makes you say it's too hard though?

6444
02:42:59,101 --> 02:42:59,934
Just out of curiosity.

6445
02:43:00,180 --> 02:43:00,541
Well,

6446
02:43:00,541 --> 02:43:01,374
I think

6447
02:43:02,930 --> 02:43:03,640
for men,

6448
02:43:03,640 --> 02:43:04,180
I think

6449
02:43:04,180 --> 02:43:05,030
it's a look,

6450
02:43:05,080 --> 02:43:06,040
legitimately.

6451
02:43:06,700 --> 02:43:10,570
Some people believe that that's how
human beings existed a long time ago.

6452
02:43:10,571 --> 02:43:12,400
That that's the mushroom orgies.

6453
02:43:12,550 --> 02:43:12,851
You know,

6454
02:43:12,851 --> 02:43:13,840
the idea of,

6455
02:43:13,841 --> 02:43:14,260
uh,

6456
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:14,501
you know,

6457
02:43:14,501 --> 02:43:17,140
these orgiastic groups of,

6458
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:17,800
you know,

6459
02:43:17,800 --> 02:43:22,120
free sex monkeys that existed
millions of years ago.

6460
02:43:22,150 --> 02:43:22,301
You know,

6461
02:43:22,301 --> 02:43:24,910
Mckenna had that whole
thing that he believed that,

6462
02:43:25,260 --> 02:43:25,511
you know,

6463
02:43:25,511 --> 02:43:27,100
and it really,

6464
02:43:27,101 --> 02:43:27,934
uh,

6465
02:43:28,270 --> 02:43:32,440
the idea behind it is that at one point
in time mushrooms were a huge part of

6466
02:43:32,441 --> 02:43:35,230
human diets and they were part of all
these rituals and people would get

6467
02:43:35,231 --> 02:43:38,380
together and eat them and they would have
these orgies and have all this parties

6468
02:43:38,381 --> 02:43:39,214
and have a good time.

6469
02:43:39,340 --> 02:43:41,740
And that slowly but
surely the climate change,

6470
02:43:41,741 --> 02:43:45,730
the mushrooms became more and more rare
and they were hoarded by the elites and

6471
02:43:45,731 --> 02:43:48,010
then they were also
kept from other people.

6472
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:52,840
And then the sort of this orgiastic
communal society that we had this

6473
02:43:52,841 --> 02:43:54,250
matriarchal society by the way,

6474
02:43:54,251 --> 02:43:56,510
that worship the mother and we're
shipping the mother earth and you know,

6475
02:43:56,540 --> 02:43:59,560
which mushrooms sort of tend to like
put you in tune with that frequency.

6476
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:02,950
That all dissolved as a climate change.

6477
02:44:02,951 --> 02:44:05,920
And he actually documents it down to
them taking mushrooms and putting them in

6478
02:44:05,921 --> 02:44:09,030
honey and that the honey became
psychoactive as well because honey,

6479
02:44:09,031 --> 02:44:12,400
when it ferments becomes mead and then
you have a completely polar opposite

6480
02:44:12,401 --> 02:44:12,861
society.

6481
02:44:12,861 --> 02:44:14,470
You have an alcohol based society,

6482
02:44:15,110 --> 02:44:15,760
you know,

6483
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:17,140
inflates the ego,

6484
02:44:17,710 --> 02:44:22,000
diminishes objectivity and self
awareness or diminishes the feelings of,

6485
02:44:22,210 --> 02:44:23,043
you know,

6486
02:44:23,050 --> 02:44:23,890
of connectivity.

6487
02:44:24,190 --> 02:44:26,000
It was a good,

6488
02:44:26,200 --> 02:44:28,730
oh that was the 10 minute
warning for that shot caller.

6489
02:44:28,740 --> 02:44:29,050
You know,

6490
02:44:29,050 --> 02:44:29,381
it wasn't,

6491
02:44:29,381 --> 02:44:29,561
you know,

6492
02:44:29,561 --> 02:44:30,250
a 10 minute warning.

6493
02:44:30,250 --> 02:44:30,520
All right,

6494
02:44:30,520 --> 02:44:31,780
well let's fucking rap this bitch up.

6495
02:44:31,880 --> 02:44:32,110

This motherfucker home.

6497
02:44:32,951 --> 02:44:34,150
We've covered just about everything.

6498
02:44:34,930 --> 02:44:36,130
Kevin bracy you again.

6499
02:44:36,131 --> 02:44:36,671
Once again,

6500
02:44:36,671 --> 02:44:37,580
you are a bad mother.

6501
02:44:37,581 --> 02:44:37,890
Fuck.

6502
02:44:37,890 --> 02:44:38,420
Well thank you.

6503
02:44:38,420 --> 02:44:40,870
Every time you come on this
podcast you do not disappoint.

6504
02:44:40,871 --> 02:44:41,411
Appreciate it.

6505
02:44:41,411 --> 02:44:43,540

6510
02:44:46,811 --> 02:44:49,670
Don't you fucking laugh when I call
your brilliant and your brilliance.

6511
02:44:50,770 --> 02:44:53,680
I appreciate septic sockets.

6512
02:44:53,950 --> 02:44:57,580
That's my take it inside you and I'm
pounding that into a fleshlight doing

6513
02:44:57,581 --> 02:44:58,414
appreciate it.

6514
02:44:58,480 --> 02:44:59,350
I'll give you a new one.

6515
02:44:59,410 --> 02:45:00,280
A freshie.

6516
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:02,290
I want to try this Alpha Dog Alpha,

6517
02:45:02,850 --> 02:45:03,940
the Alpha brain.

6518
02:45:03,960 --> 02:45:04,440
Cause I will,

6519
02:45:04,440 --> 02:45:05,800
I will absolutely report back.

6520
02:45:05,840 --> 02:45:06,040
Yeah,

6521
02:45:06,040 --> 02:45:06,910
I'll give you a big bottle.

6522
02:45:06,911 --> 02:45:07,361
And if you,

6523
02:45:07,361 --> 02:45:08,010
um,

6524
02:45:08,010 --> 02:45:08,741
if folks at home,

6525
02:45:08,741 --> 02:45:09,520
you want to try it,

6526
02:45:09,520 --> 02:45:10,090
first of all,

6527
02:45:10,090 --> 02:45:10,923
if you don't want to try it,

6528
02:45:10,990 --> 02:45:11,470
don't,

6529
02:45:11,470 --> 02:45:12,010
if you,

6530
02:45:12,010 --> 02:45:12,430
if you,

6531
02:45:12,430 --> 02:45:13,390
if you want the,

6532
02:45:13,420 --> 02:45:14,253
the effects,

6533
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:15,833
stop qualifying,

6534
02:45:15,970 --> 02:45:18,280
go online and finding ingredients.

6535
02:45:18,281 --> 02:45:20,380
I welcome you to copy the ingredients.

6536
02:45:20,381 --> 02:45:20,740
Go ahead,

6537
02:45:20,740 --> 02:45:21,880
copy it and do it all yourself.

6538
02:45:22,180 --> 02:45:25,000
But if you want a one stop shop
and you want to do it all yourself,

6539
02:45:25,060 --> 02:45:25,511
I enjoy it.

6540
02:45:25,511 --> 02:45:26,620
It's called Alpha brain.

6541
02:45:26,770 --> 02:45:31,420
And if you'd go to [inaudible] Dot com
o n n I t.com and when you're ordering

6542
02:45:31,450 --> 02:45:32,560
entering the code name Rogan,

6543
02:45:32,590 --> 02:45:34,030

6544
02:45:34,210 --> 02:45:34,870
And uh,

6545
02:45:34,870 --> 02:45:36,040
let me know if you love it or hate it.

6546
02:45:36,250 --> 02:45:38,320
Holla at me on Twitter bitches.

6547
02:45:38,350 --> 02:45:40,270
I've been remembering
my dreams like crazy,

6548
02:45:40,271 --> 02:45:41,320
like super detailed.

6549
02:45:41,321 --> 02:45:44,080
I remember the last three
nights in my dream on purpose.

6550
02:45:44,830 --> 02:45:45,460
Yeah,

6551
02:45:45,460 --> 02:45:47,440
I take them right before
I go to bed on purpose,

6552
02:45:47,810 --> 02:45:50,140
but I usually I take them
in the morning anyway.

6553
02:45:50,200 --> 02:45:51,520
What the fuck ever.

6554
02:45:51,940 --> 02:45:53,230
Thank you to the fleshlight.

6555
02:45:53,231 --> 02:45:54,580
If you go to Joe rogan.net,

6556
02:45:54,581 --> 02:45:56,500
click on the link for the
flashlight entering the code name.

6557
02:45:56,501 --> 02:45:57,060
Rogan.

6558
02:45:57,060 --> 02:46:01,060
You will get 15% off the number one
sort of still format this Friday.

6559
02:46:01,061 --> 02:46:03,190
Friday is a sold out yet.

6560
02:46:03,310 --> 02:46:04,240
Not Soda yet.

6561
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:06,061
It will.

6562
02:46:06,061 --> 02:46:07,390
We haven't even really talked about it.

6563
02:46:07,391 --> 02:46:08,770
We're doing a show at the ice house.

6564
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:10,460
It's a tiny ass room.

6565
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:13,640
I got a tweet from some dude's
flying in from 1500 miles away.

6566
02:46:13,670 --> 02:46:14,061
Are You sir?

6567
02:46:14,061 --> 02:46:14,360
This?

6568
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:14,790
Yeah.

6569
02:46:14,790 --> 02:46:15,020
Yeah.

6570
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:15,741
We have two shows.

6571
02:46:15,741 --> 02:46:16,520
Eight and 10 to,

6572
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:16,880
yeah,

6573
02:46:16,880 --> 02:46:17,480
it's a cool,

6574
02:46:17,480 --> 02:46:18,560
it's a great room.

6575
02:46:18,590 --> 02:46:18,921
It's a,

6576
02:46:18,921 --> 02:46:23,000
it's a tiny 85 seat room and
the fucking show is outstanding.

6577
02:46:23,100 --> 02:46:23,931
It's me,

6578
02:46:23,931 --> 02:46:25,070
Brendan Walsh,

6579
02:46:25,100 --> 02:46:27,110
little Esther out magical.

6580
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:29,510
I can Josh Mcdermitt,

6581
02:46:29,511 --> 02:46:29,981
Josh Mc,

6582
02:46:29,981 --> 02:46:30,320
Germans.

6583
02:46:30,320 --> 02:46:30,860
Hilarious.

6584
02:46:30,860 --> 02:46:31,760
It's a great,

6585
02:46:31,761 --> 02:46:32,451
great show.

6586
02:46:32,451 --> 02:46:32,751
And it's,

6587
02:46:32,751 --> 02:46:35,690
we're going to do a lot of these and
we're going to set up a laptop there and

6588
02:46:35,691 --> 02:46:38,690
we're also gonna do a podcast
live from the ice eyes.

6589
02:46:39,470 --> 02:46:41,510
So we'll see you bitches on Friday.

6590
02:46:41,680 --> 02:46:41,990
Um,

6591
02:46:41,990 --> 02:46:42,410
that's,

6592
02:46:42,410 --> 02:46:44,570
this is probably the last
podcast for the week,

6593
02:46:44,571 --> 02:46:48,230
but we might do another one later in
the week because that's how I roll.

6594
02:46:48,260 --> 02:46:49,850
I roll sporadically.

6595
02:46:50,150 --> 02:46:53,150
I appreciate all of
the love on to Twitter,

6596
02:46:53,151 --> 02:46:54,290
on message board.

6597
02:46:54,291 --> 02:46:56,360
On a line on the ultimate fighting.

6598
02:46:56,660 --> 02:46:58,110
What I was doing there.

6599
02:46:58,120 --> 02:46:59,870
If I could bring up something
I just opened up real quick.

6600
02:46:59,871 --> 02:47:00,350
Yeah.

6601
02:47:00,350 --> 02:47:02,680
We have a podcast named death squad and a,

6602
02:47:02,690 --> 02:47:04,580
we used to only accept donations.

6603
02:47:04,581 --> 02:47:05,960
That's our only way to survive.

6604
02:47:06,420 --> 02:47:09,200
Now we just open up a new website
called [inaudible] dot com not dig,

6605
02:47:09,201 --> 02:47:10,310
but Doug do you g,

6606
02:47:10,311 --> 02:47:11,144
g e d.

6607
02:47:11,240 --> 02:47:12,980
And what that does is open this up Amazon.

6608
02:47:13,100 --> 02:47:14,930
And if you ever want to
buy anything from Amazon,

6609
02:47:14,931 --> 02:47:16,820
anything you buy from there
to legal in California,

6610
02:47:16,821 --> 02:47:17,660
you just brought it back.

6611
02:47:17,670 --> 02:47:18,920
Amazon just brought it back for me.

6612
02:47:18,921 --> 02:47:20,050
So I really want,

6613
02:47:20,051 --> 02:47:20,481
what do you mean?

6614
02:47:20,481 --> 02:47:21,230
So they returned,

6615
02:47:21,230 --> 02:47:22,420
they overturned the law,

6616
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:22,580
right?

6617
02:47:22,580 --> 02:47:23,361
They did something.

6618
02:47:23,361 --> 02:47:23,760
Yes,

6619
02:47:23,760 --> 02:47:24,290
they were,

6620
02:47:24,290 --> 02:47:25,020
they,

6621
02:47:25,020 --> 02:47:27,620
the Amazon had this associate's
account and they pretty much got rid of

6622
02:47:27,750 --> 02:47:28,583
[inaudible].

6623
02:47:28,760 --> 02:47:29,690
When did it come back?

6624
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:30,370
It just came back,

6625
02:47:30,370 --> 02:47:30,581
uh,

6626
02:47:30,581 --> 02:47:31,371
two weeks ago.

6627
02:47:31,371 --> 02:47:33,290
So I didn't hear about this.

6628
02:47:33,291 --> 02:47:33,941
I didn't hear that was the,

6629
02:47:33,941 --> 02:47:35,570
that was one that made me angry.

6630
02:47:36,410 --> 02:47:38,240
I get angry about a internet gambling.

6631
02:47:38,241 --> 02:47:38,900
That's another,

6632
02:47:38,900 --> 02:47:39,320
yeah.

6633
02:47:39,320 --> 02:47:40,071
I don't want to get angry.

6634
02:47:40,071 --> 02:47:41,210
This is the end of the fucking show.

6635
02:47:41,500 --> 02:47:43,480
Positive Positive Ladies and gentlemen.

We're all in this motherfucker
together and Shit's getting crazy.

6643
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:55,310
That's all going to change or
keep your frequency positive.

6644
02:47:55,610 --> 02:47:56,443
Work hard.

Stay honest.

6646
02:47:58,880 --> 02:47:59,720
May the force be with you.

6647
