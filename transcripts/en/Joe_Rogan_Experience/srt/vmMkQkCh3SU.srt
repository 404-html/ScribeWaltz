1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,410
And

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,100
An action,
ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,430
your response to your complaints about 
the horrible audio quality.

4
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:11,020
We figured it all out.
Folks.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,080
We have,
um,

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,490
first of all,
we have these mics that you have to 

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:17,490
hold.
We're going to hold them this week.

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:17,490
Next week we're gonna.
Have these little clip on things,

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,290
but we have a mixer now and we're 
listening to headphones and we 

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,940
understand your complaints.
See the problem was these things,

11
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,090
these microphones were in stands and 
they were over here and it makes a huge 

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,860
fucking difference how it sounds here 
and here.

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,700
So me,
buddy,

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,810
to fellow,
someone always has the laptop on volume 

15
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:42,030
on.
But uh,

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,900
we're live and uh,

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,760
was that,

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,200
it's not me fella to.
Oh,

19
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:56,800
it's my other computer.
We had two computers that were on.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,910
Hold on one second.

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,540
Yeah.

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,900
So how's it sounding guys that are in 
there?

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,450
It should be nice and loud.
I would imagine.

24
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,720
Much,
much better.

25
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,800
Okay,
we're back.

26
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,350
Sorry.
Sorry for everything being retarded.

27
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,840
I'm drinking coffee that came out of an 
animal's ass.

28
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,590
Oh,
that's one of those ones where they 

29
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
filter it through something.
It's called a Kopi Luwak.

30
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,110
That's the name of the coffee and um,
there's a,

31
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:34,111
an animal called a palm civet and this 
animal eats these coffee beans,

32
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,440
eats the bean itself,
you know,

33
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,740
like what it looks like,
a little fruit.

34
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,300
Shits it out and then they take them and
clean them.

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,990
I guess hopefully they cleaned them and 
then they make coffee out of it and it's

36
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:48,760
smoother coffee.
It's like a,

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,480
like a different sort of a different 
flavor to it because they went through 

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,471
this animal's digestive tract now.
Now if the animal ate a lot of berries 

39
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:02,071
and stuff as it have,
like hints of other different things in 

40
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:02,071
it,
you know,

41
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:03,460
it doesn't,
it just tastes like coffee.

42
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,350
I mean it's,
it's really kind of gross when you think

43
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:07,180
about it.
But I was curious.

44
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:09,310
I had it once before.
Remember tate nine.

45
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,670
We're in Florida and they had it at a 
restaurant and I,

46
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:13,000
I'd heard about it.
So we tried it out.

47
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,180
Apparently it's the,
whatever the stomach acids or whatever 

48
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,541
it is inside the civets body changes the
actual chemical structure of the coffee 

49
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:26,470
and it just makes it much smoother and 
it's okay.

50
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,390
You know what I mean?
It's not really.

51
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,550
It's the price.
A lot more expensive.

52
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,780
Yeah.
It's super expensive.

53
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:33,730
It's way more expensive than regular 
coffee.

54
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:34,830
Yeah.
Way more than.

55
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,310
I remember the restaurant was like $90 
or something stupid like that.

56
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:42,410
Yeah.
Animal.

57
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,620
But how's it?
How's it sounding for everyone?

58
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:45,850
What's the people saying?
Oh,

59
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,060
I think it sounded good.
I think we're golden with this thing.

60
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,580
This,
this shit is so much louder.

61
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,580
Cool.
Yeah,

62
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,310
it's way,
way,

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,180
way,
way better.

64
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,250
So,
um,

65
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,090
anyway,
sponsored by fleshlight.

66
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:00,340
By the way,
I haven't talk that it's sponsored

67
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,260
by poor.
Sponsored by a rubber vagina.

68
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,880
Yeah.
Do you ever fuck the asshole and.

69
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,740
No,
no,

70
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,180
no.
I don't think that's necessarily.

71
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,090
Well,
it's just tighter.

72
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,100
It might feel good.
It doesn't have to be fleshlight tight 

73
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,100
enough.
Yeah,

74
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,170
I think it's good.
And think you need the butthole one 

75
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:16,960
unless you're just a freak and your wife
will let you have the butthole.

76
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,180
You can have a rubber butthole,
you know,

77
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,240
she should be happy.
You get your butthole fantasies out of 

78
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,240
the way.
Did you know about the bottom?

79
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,140
Uh,
that it unscrews and it's like a suction

80
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,290
because like,
I didn't know the first time I fucked 

81
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,211
it,
it was like this really suction like 

82
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:34,300
crazy blow job and it was just too much,
too intense.

83
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,040
Couldn't take it because Brian's got a 
giant hog is hitting the back.

84
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,020
Brian's got a fucking oatmeal quaker 
oats box.

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,440
That's his dick.
I unscrewed it and I guess that adds air

86
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:47,260
to it and makes it a lot better.
So you get the fuck a slut.

87
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:50,140
Yeah.
So it's either a girl or a slut or a big

88
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:51,280
giant slot.
Right.

89
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,570
And by the way,
it was awesome.

90
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,620
I fucking love it was crazy though,
is that at first I started out putting a

91
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:03,151
bunch of juice in it and it was a juice 
or whatever that oil is the loop.

92
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,740
I'm like,
what are you fucking oranges and shit.

93
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,690
I wasn't that impressed.
I was like,

94
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,830
all right,
this is just too much,

95
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,270
you know,
this is like fucking bitch.

96
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,280
And then you took the lube down,
took it down a notch and now it's 

97
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,880
fucking fantastic.
So you have a formula they use.

98
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,760
How many courts will loop?
Just a teeny bit around the lips of it.

99
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,930
Really.
That's it.

100
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:23,180
Just that their water party started 
right?

101
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,030
Spit on it.
If you're feeling dirty,

102
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,860
fucking whore horn the ticket right back
on there.

103
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,950
No,
but you know,

104
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:34,951
I tried warming it up in the microwave.
And you're not supposed to do that 

105
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:34,951
already.
No,

106
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:34,951
no,
no.

107
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:36,240
The juice or the liquid stuff.
I'd put it in a cup.

108
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:38,140
It was like get a melted and stick your 
Dick in there.

109
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:41,560
It's gonna fucking fuse to your Dick.
That hot molten plastic.

110
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:45,400
And you'd be screaming.
Third Degree Burns all over your Dick.

111
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,660
Could you imagine somebody must have 
somebody must have nuked something.

112
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,740
Got It.
Too Hot.

113
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:52,210
Fuck it.
And ruin their deck.

114
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,410
That's happened.
Totally.

115
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,060
Totally.
If you thought about it,

116
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,170
it's happened.
You know.

117
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,340
So like I was saying,
I put this picture up on my twitter the 

118
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,340
other day.
Somebody,

119
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:01,930
somebody sent me this twitter.
Hey Joe,

120
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:04,180
have you ever seen a triangle like this 
before?

121
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,980
So I click on it,
you know,

122
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:08,470
thinking that it's probably a guy caught
somebody in a triangle.

123
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,360
Well,
it Sorta,

124
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,200
what it is is this site called 
[inaudible] dot com.

125
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:19,201
Do you know that site?
It's a site that is dedicated to all.

126
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,270
It's all white guys like nerdy white 
guys and they're making these black 

127
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:27,350
ghetto,
cigs gagged from fucking their mouths.

128
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,610
And so I tuned into this picture.
I clicked this link.

129
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:35,611
This guy sends me and it says white 
nerdy dude with these pale skinny white 

130
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:40,021
legs with black socks and black sneakers
on and he's got to know arm triangle 

131
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,710
like this around this chick's head.
This chick's head is like right here.

132
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,620
And she's,
you know,

133
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,640
he's shoving his dick in her mouth with 
his triangle and she's like literally 

134
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,820
throwing up all over his balls and his 
asshole.

135
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:57,680
And I'm like,
he said so much to me though that what

136
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,130
kind of a strange world do we live in 
where it's so normal to just click a 

137
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,811
link and it takes you to a guy stuff in 
his dick into some chick's mouth and 

138
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:10,850
she's throwing up all over his balls and
asshole.

139
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,220
And all I do is giggle.
All I do is go,

140
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,690
ah,
you got me a fuck.

141
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,960
You know what I'm saying?
I mean if this was just 10 or 20 years 

142
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,321
ago,
that picture would fucking freak you 

143
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:24,080
out.
There was no pictures like that.

144
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,330
You could net.
When I was in high school,

145
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,280
the most you got is like hustler where 
they spread their pussy lips apart.

146
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:31,850
You're like,
wow,

147
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,560
there's pitches crazy,
dirty,

148
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,990
like they weren't even allowed to show 
penetration.

149
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,870
They would show like a guy,
they would have like a sex scene and the

150
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:43,871
guy would be like grabbing his dick to 
try to keep it hard and looking at her 

151
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:47,261
and it would look totally fake and posed
and it didn't look like real sex at all.

152
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,380
They,
you know,

153
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:51,920
it was hard to find pictures of,
of fucked up things.

154
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,040
But now what's,
what's the link with the website?

155
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,840
Ghetto gaggers,
ghetto ghetto.

156
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,040
If you just go to twitter.com/Joe
Rogan and look at my past tweets,

157
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,190
you'll find that a few days ago,
I forgot how many days ago it was,

158
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,960
but this motherfucker got me with this 
picture and it's just so crazy that that

159
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,740
it's so easy to find images like that.
There's so many out there.

160
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,300
Kids today,
dude,

161
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,390
they're growing up in a totally 
different fucking world.

162
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,540
A world where you can click a link.
I mean how many kids subscribed to my 

163
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,661
twitter,
how many kids click that link and went 

164
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:31,520
to that guy stuffing his dick in that 
ghetto girls mouth and she's throwing up

165
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,110
all of it's not fair and I wonder if 
it's like.

166
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,530
Because I mean I,
I got off it like sears catalog,

167
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:39,680
looking at underwear ads and stuff like 
that and now you can just see the inside

168
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:40,790
of a girl's asshole.

169
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,860
You know,
anytime you.

170
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,580
I used to be able to beat off to like a,
like a,

171
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,420
like a workout,
like vhs cover,

172
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,530
you know like girl bent over trying to 
look sexy and it used to be able to beat

173
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:53,990
off something like that.
Like you dirty bitch,

174
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,290
but now it's like peas dudes are 
desensitized.

175
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,770
These kids are gonna grow up and not to 
be able to get off unless like somebody 

176
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,620
like goats sees them and like shits in 
their face and stuff like that.

177
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:04,490
You know what I mean?
Cause they're starting.

178
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Some people do get to like really crazy 
points where the only thing that gets 

179
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,520
them off it was like really fucked up 
shit.

180
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,550
There's porn to the caterers.
Just to those dudes.

181
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,400
I told you about the time that tate nine
went to see a porno being taped.

182
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,300
We walked in,
we walked in.

183
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,840
This dude Salami that we stood Jujitsu 
with,

184
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,560
great guy and he was a.
He was directed porn and I told him to 

185
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:26,810
come on,
do this shot,

186
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,260
come by and check it out.
And all right,

187
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:30,430
we're,
we're on our way back from a Gig land at

188
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,970
the airport will go before we even go 
home.

189
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:35,270
Let's go check out this can go to this.
Watch this dude's Bournville.

190
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,500
We walk in and there's this one guy 
fucking this girl in the asshole and the

191
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:42,380
other guy's fucking this girl in the 
mouth and they're spitting in her mouth.

192
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Everyone's spitting her mouth,
both guys and the director and he was 

193
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,971
like,
grab her by the hair of spit in her 

194
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:51,971
mouth and this gal spitting her mouth.
I mean it was like,

195
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:53,720
it was fucking.
It was rough,

196
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,890
man.
The Guy,

197
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,040
the guy's fucking her in the

198
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,860
asshole and then he stuffs it in her 
pussy and he goes,

199
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:00,780
yeah,
I'm an asshole to your pussy.

200
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:02,430
Hats.
Real fucking healthy.

201
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,300
Like whoa.
I remember like not porn is this.

202
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,590
I remember watching porn and then first 
seeing how people spitting on the girl's

203
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:14,010
crotch before fucking in it.
So I tried it with my ex girlfriend back

204
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:19,011
in the day.
Did you just spit on my trunk?

205
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,090
I think I goofed on her crotch.
I didn't just say,

206
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh,
I'm sorry.

207
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,080
There's something dudes like that.
When girl spit on Dick's,

208
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,480
they had lived those pornos with girls.
Spend a dick.

209
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,510
I'm like,
that's just showing me this like anger 

210
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:38,510
there or something.
It's like craziness.

211
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,250
That's,
you don't need to spit on it and you 

212
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,201
know,
you want to lick it and want to get it 

213
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:45,201
all sloppy.
Wet.

214
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:45,201
That's all good.
That's all good.

215
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:45,210
You don't need to get crazy.

216
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,580
The worst is when they spit in a girl's 
butt and it's like disappeared.

217
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,880
See little bubbles.
Shit.

218
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,881
Like come on.
People will never find the end.

219
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,620
There's no end.
You know,

220
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,650
it's just advancing and escalating and 
it's the more exposure to this shit that

221
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:08,691
we have,
the more it desensitizes people to like 

222
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,331
regular sex crows were taken in the ass 
left and right now there's like reports 

223
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:15,381
about it.
Like all these doctors are having 

224
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,001
problems with girls having but VD,
they're shitting themselves by the age 

225
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:17,001
of 30,
you know,

226
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,560
it's fucked up.
It's fucked up.

227
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:22,730
Get yourself a rubber butthole.
Fleshlight if you got that,

228
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,830
the whole thing inside you.
I tried to warm up the juice and uh,

229
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,190
so then I,
if I had to do the microwave thing,

230
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:34,191
I went into the bedroom,
put they put it and I didn't have a 

231
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:34,191
boner anymore because I was like doing 
like kitchen shit.

232
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:38,750
Then I had to like get myself hard again
by looking at some porn and then I went 

233
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,050
over and the juice was not warm anymore 
and it was just like,

234
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,050
ah.
So I,

235
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,250
I've reached a point in my life where if
my dick is not hard,

236
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm not gonna even try to get it hard to
jerk off.

237
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,710
I do not set aside time to jerk off.
I don't like sit down and my Dick's not 

238
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,940
hard to go jerk off and start rubbing 
myself.

239
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,040
You've got to be born.
He didn't do it.

240
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,150
Now you've never done that?
Oh,

241
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,180
I have in the past for sure dude.
I've had days where I jerked off like 

242
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,100
four and five times a day where you 
just,

243
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,560
you don't even know why you're doing it.
It's like,

244
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:06,720
this doesn't even feel good anymore.
Like why do I keep doing this?

245
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,550
You're doing it just because you're 
obsessed,

246
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,740
you know,
just because you got to a wacky bug,

247
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,440
you know,
and you just want to keep jerking off.

248
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,230
It relaxes me.
I,

249
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,130
you know,
it's like when you say,

250
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,710
when you talk about how you take a big 
shit and then you're like,

251
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,100
I can't believe I had this shit.
Me.

252
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,850
That's how I feel like the sperm,
it's controlling me.

253
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,940
Know for sure.
But not when you do it five times for 

254
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:28,940
one shot.
Yeah.

255
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,871
One day.
Even two shots that they might give you 

256
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:32,871
a feeling crazy,
you know,

257
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:32,871
you,
you,

258
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:36,971
you just got a text message from your ex
wife and she's having a hard time with 

259
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:37,510
her husband and I know you think,
Gosh,

260
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,510
fuck this dirty,
but she didn't hate her and she took all

261
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:41,160
my money and just beat one off real 
quick.

262
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:42,470
You know,
you might get a second one out of it.

263
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,410
It's exciting.
Right?

264
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,440
But other than that one is one a days.
All you need when you start jerking off 

265
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,290
five times a day,
you're just a fucking Weirdo.

266
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,490
You know?
What do you do?

267
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:53,340
I used to get blisters on my dick from 
jerking off too,

268
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,160
and I really would

269
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,260
just hold it another way.
I would figure out another way.

270
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,520
No,
on two separate occasions in my life I 

271
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,690
jerked off so much that I developed like
a little sore spot on my,

272
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,190
so there's no way you could be enjoying 
that.

273
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Like why you jerking off that much 
because you fucking crazy.

274
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,660
I mean that's what it is.
It's like you just get it in your head 

275
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:18,670
that you have to check off.
When I used to fuck pillows,

276
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,250
what was so bad?
His accent ever used my hand.

277
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:23,470
I would fuck pillows.
The worst is watching my mom.

278
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:28,471
Like you draw so much when you're 
talking about just go in the laundry 

279
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:31,630
room and she's like taking off pillows,
sheets that we're sticking to it and you

280
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,610
just look at my pillow and it looked 
like,

281
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:36,220
you know,
fucking has for sure.

282
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,600
Touched your loads.
Totally.

283
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:38,410
How does that feel?

284
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,210
I don't know.
I just can't believe.

285
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:42,910
How weird is that?
Your mom has touched your,

286
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,430
your semen?
Yeah.

287
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,230
Yeah.
Well she made it.

288
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,750
That's true.
It all came from her,

289
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,370
right?
She cooked it up inside of her.

290
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,080
It wasn't for her.
You wouldn't be alive.

291
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:54,580
You wouldn't have any sperm.
Totally.

292
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,820
And I just got a three d TV,
one of those new.

293
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:58,420
Uh,
yeah.

294
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:00,410
You were telling me about this and he 
watched porn on this.

295
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,590
How does this work?
So explain to me,

296
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,170
this is what company makes this.
Just a Samsung TV.

297
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:08,080
It's because I saw Sony,
but Sony said it's not even out yet.

298
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,960
Tony's on out until the summer.
It was very impressive though,

299
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,710
right?
Yeah.

300
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:13,250
That Samsung.
What it does is it right.

301
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,080
I got a three d TV in a Red Blue Ray 
player and it converts first.

302
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,260
You could watch anything on TV,
any show,

303
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:23,040
any TV and it will convert it into three
d if you want.

304
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,100
How the fuck does it do that?
It has like a smart technology where it 

305
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,250
detects what a background is and what 
the main character is in.

306
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,340
Tries to layer it.
And that's a really good job.

307
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:34,660
Actually.
I was so impressed.

308
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:37,480
I thought it was gonna be like bullshit.
But it was like I watched bill and Ted's

309
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:40,330
excellent adventure and it looked like 
it was made for three days.

310
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,250
That's insane.
Yeah.

311
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,200
It's pretty crazy.
And you wear goggles A.

312
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Yeah.
You were these little glasses and what 

313
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,240
are they gonna fix that?
Well,

314
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,950
supposedly they were already invented 
the technology to do it and when it 

315
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,340
does,
it's like this great that goes over your

316
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:56,341
tv and it detects where you're sitting 
in the room and it kind of like splits 

317
00:13:56,861 --> 00:14:01,861
the images up for you,
like from left and right eye and it 

318
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:02,140
makes it three d,
but it's too expensive right now.

319
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,140
They said that in the next five to eight
years you'll start seeing it coming out 

320
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,400
in it and then it will be integrated 
into television and be a part of it.

321
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:14,430
Right.
And what's weird about it is that you 

322
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,220
using the three d,
you immediately get it.

323
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Like I get it,
like you're going to have a TV that's 

324
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,430
going to be three dimensional soon where
it's going to look like you're a window,

325
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:23,080
but you're going to be able to kind of,
you know,

326
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:23,670
it's,
it's,

327
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:29,010
it's crazy when you,
when you start really getting it now 

328
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,340
just tvs themselves are insane.
We're just so used to it.

329
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,520
The I just the idea of capturing image,
capturing any image and I mean you're 

330
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:41,731
literally taking a snapshot of what's in
front of you and somehow or another you 

331
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:45,790
can send that,
you can put it in you and you don't even

332
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:49,030
have to connect it to anything.
It goes from your phone and it can go to

333
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:50,530
the whole world.
You'll put it on flicker,

334
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,150
right?
And someone in Nicaragua

335
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,160
can look at it.
Not to mention that TVS are like this 

336
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,160
skinny by the way.
Yeah.

337
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,700
And so pretty soon you're just going to 
have a look at an IPAD 3d.

338
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,870
How nuts is that?
Those things will fucking crystal clear.

339
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,950
Those really awesome image and it's this
little skinny ass thing,

340
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:08,380
like a piece of paper,
you know,

341
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,710
it's like a couple pieces of cardboard 
stack together,

342
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,110
right?
That's fucking nuts,

343
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,190
man.
Tvs today,

344
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:18,430
you know,
you go and look at these tvs and just 

345
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:18,620
think about how long ago was that?
You know,

346
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:22,610
you have like this stupid looking like 
rounded circles,

347
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:26,150
rounded edges on the corner and it was 
big as fuck.

348
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:28,070
And you had to.
Everybody had to help you move it.

349
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,980
Did you have those new routines?
You remember what my grandmother used to

350
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:32,600
have,
like where it used to be a record player

351
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:35,720
on the top and then the speakers on that
side have been there.

352
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,420
It the.
Yeah,

353
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,860
and it was black and white and it was 
tiny.

354
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:41,750
It was like fucking smaller than your 
laptop.

355
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,690
It's a piece of furniture,
you know?

356
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,730
It was a coffee table that was super 
long and that was just a lifetime ago.

357
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,380
I mean,
that's what my parents grew up with.

358
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,140
My parents grew up with that shit.
That Shit's bananas.

359
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,320
It is.
It's pretty fucking insane where 

360
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,550
technology's headed,
but it's just as insane just thinking 

361
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:03,550
about where it's gone.
You know,

362
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,660
if you ever wanted evidence of 
evolution,

363
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,070
it's evolution seems to be a pattern 
that everything follows.

364
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,410
You know,
people want to like get angry whether or

365
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:15,020
not evolution exists and whether or not 
evolution is real.

366
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:18,500
And very few people even truly 
understand the argument.

367
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:19,910
It's a very,
very,

368
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,400
very complex argument,
but the argument really isn't,

369
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,640
is there a god?
The argument is everything seems to 

370
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:27,640
evolve.

371
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,290
Every single thing seems to change and 
human beings are the clearest example 

372
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:37,121
that just based on our culture,
if you look at just the shit that we 

373
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:41,090
have now in comparison to the things we 
had a few years ago and the movies,

374
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,120
if you like,
watch movies and listen to songs from 

375
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,150
like the forties and the fifties and 
then you listen to some new shit even if

376
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:50,760
you don't like most new shit or you 
think it's stupid or you think it's that

377
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,220
the I,
I'm with you on all that,

378
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:57,221
but just the technical level that 
they're able to like the kind of music 

379
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:58,310
they're able to make now,
you know,

380
00:16:58,311 --> 00:16:59,840
it's very,
very different.

381
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:03,740
It's incredibly powerful.
Like you might not be into pink,

382
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,830
listen to a Goddamn pink song and then 
try to go back in time and listen to 

383
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,890
some Jefferson airplane and shit and see
the,

384
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:11,300
like the,
how they recorded it.

385
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,480
Even if you love that song,
it's like they did a terrible job of 

386
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,170
like putting it all together.
The evolution of music,

387
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:21,530
the evolution of television shows like 
try watching father knows best.

388
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,140
Try watching any of those fucking stupid
movies from the fifties.

389
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:26,870
Those goddamn things are terrible.
They're terrible.

390
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,850
It's like everybody falls in love 
immediately.

391
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:30,500
The bad guy.
Super obvious.

392
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,670
There's like everything happens.
It's so corny and phony and now you 

393
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,160
know,
it's,

394
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,090
it's very clear that things are moving 
in a certain direction,

395
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,240
but everything is not everything though.
Like when you go to a gas station and 

396
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,780
you,
you prepay for like 20 bucks in that 

397
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,270
last dollar takes down.

398
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,490
Why does it do that?
Because they want to make sure it 

399
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,531
doesn't go over.
You think they need technology to fix 

400
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:57,531
that because.
Because,

401
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:58,330
because when you do it yourself,
you could just turn it off like that and

402
00:17:58,331 --> 00:18:00,510
then it's like three cents spam.
You know what I mean?

403
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,740
They don't want you to go over because 
if you go over just a little bit and 

404
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,000
everybody goes over just a little bit 
and you add that little bit altogether,

405
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:11,001
it's probably millions of dollars,
but there should be a technology where 

406
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:13,371
it just turns it off at this time.
Well really the problem is the real 

407
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:15,630
technology issue is that this fucking 
fuel issue,

408
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,610
the real technology is the gasoline 
thing.

409
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:21,150
We need gasoline to make every single 
thing on this earth and we need gasoline

410
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:22,370
to move.
No,

411
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,410
that's the real technological.
That's the hurdle.

412
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,070
The hurdle isn't your last dollar when 
you're prepaying for gas.

413
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,430
The hurdle horses,
the real hurdle is the fucking oil,

414
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,800
you know,
that's frightened shit man.

415
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,980
Whether there things,
what my point was there is things that 

416
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:39,980
you're just,
I'm amazed that,

417
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:39,980
that,
you know,

418
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,650
such things are so different from 20 
years ago.

419
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,030
Other things like that,
it's just like,

420
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:47,640
come on gas pumps a.
well yeah,

421
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:49,980
I hear you,
but I don't think overall,

422
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:53,370
I don't think it's important for that.
There's no innovation as far as like the

423
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:58,371
fuel does that eventually they're gonna 
have to come up with something new and 

424
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,250
then when that happens then then,
then we'll,

425
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:01,260
we'll reach some new point where,
you know,

426
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,210
we're,
we have to abandon a gasoline entirely,

427
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:05,850
but they're going to have to make some 
gigantic discoveries.

428
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,530
But that's so possible,
man.

429
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:08,610
People,
you know,

430
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,470
people don't even think about how 
possible it is.

431
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:15,471
They could,
they could come up with some new way to 

432
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:15,740
fucking make hydrogen tomorrow and it 
would change everything you know,

433
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,780
or some other new type of new way of 
making batteries that makes batteries 

434
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:20,850
last longer.

435
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,830
They could figure out some weird shit 
man.

436
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:24,960
And then instantly everything changes.
Yeah.

437
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:29,961
Battery technology is slow as fuck.
I mean Mac just released a new refresh 

438
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:34,341
of their Mac book this week and it added
two or three more hours to the last 

439
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,510
model.
So that's,

440
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,610
that's pretty good.
That's a big job but usually to do that,

441
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,220
but making the batteries larger and 
making it so you can't pull them out.

442
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,360
Yeah.
But they didn't want this one.

443
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,750
No,
this is the same size.

444
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,150
I know what I mean.
They didn't change anything.

445
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:53,180
Yeah.
The new Mac books can get 10 hours 

446
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,180
supposedly nine,
10 hours.

447
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,560
I have done this,
this 17 inch Mac book pro,

448
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,570
whatever it is,
but this thing doesn't get nearly as 

449
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:00,660
much as they said if you're actually 
using it.

450
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,090
I got this one which was last model.
You know,

451
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,540
and this gets,
it's supposed to get five hours.

452
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,550
I get two hours and this is a brand new 
battery.

453
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,250
Yeah,
well it's like you have to like turn the

454
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,400
volume on the,
the brightness on a screen way down,

455
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,530
you know,
that saves a lot of it.

456
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,730
You can't be cranking volume,
you can't be watching movies if you used

457
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:23,550
Wifi,
eats it up if you have a cellular car to

458
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,580
eat it up,
but yet the ipad seems like you can do 

459
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:28,580
all that and not even take a dent to 
that.

460
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,770
Amazing.
That's what the battery.

461
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,670
What's up with that.
But that battery's crazy dude.

462
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:35,160
I use that battery for a whole weekend 
and so it's like 50 percent.

463
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:40,161
I know they should just get like three 
of those batteries and then when I'm in 

464
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:43,371
a hotel dude I sit with that thing.
I'll get on the net and I don't do it 

465
00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:43,371
for hours,
you know,

466
00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:43,680
I'll,
I'll read,

467
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:45,120
I'll even write some shit on there,
right?

468
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:48,010
Like little notes and then I look at it,
it's like 96 percent

469
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,060
battery liking that ipad by the way.
That's the future son.

470
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,070
The future is some new fucked up thing 
that's even easy to transport around.

471
00:20:57,071 --> 00:21:02,071
The Nat [inaudible].
That right now is the portable 

472
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:02,071
typewriter.
The future.

473
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:03,280
You can totally know.
It really is.

474
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,930
It's God.
I miss typewriters.

475
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,490
Did you type?

476
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,600
Oh yeah.
I had to do it for school and you know,

477
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,820
you make a mistake and you have to like 
take that white marker thing,

478
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,400
you know,
and go over it.

479
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,340
What a fucking pain in the ass it must 
have been to write a book back.

480
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,740
Then you have to actually click,
click,

481
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:19,210
click,
click,

482
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,150
click,
click,

483
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,420
click.

484
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,780
That TV though,
has this,

485
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,700
uh,
that new Three d tv I got has this thing

486
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:28,701
called the 240 megahertz mode.
It's auto motion plus mode and it is the

487
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:31,020
most fucked up thing.
What it does is it,

488
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,080
it's so fast that it actually makes up 
frames in between frames and what the 

489
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:41,661
outcome is is awful.
It makes any show or any movie look 

490
00:21:41,661 --> 00:21:43,440
completely fake.
Like when you watch,

491
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,610
if you take titanic and if you sit there
with a movie camera and film titanic,

492
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,800
it looks like a movie because it's a 
movie camera.

493
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,130
You'd take that same scene and record it
with a video camera.

494
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:55,050
It looks,
it would look fake and like kind of like

495
00:21:55,051 --> 00:22:00,051
cheap.
And that's what this does though to 

496
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:02,901
every show.
So you sit there and watched lost or 

497
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:03,210
anything you get pissed off because it 
looks like a soap opera.

498
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,450
Isn't that kind of weird that video,
like people that don't use video for 

499
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,680
things and one of the reasons is because
it makes stuff look fake or make stuff.

500
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:11,880
Look,
it doesn't look as cool,

501
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:13,830
but what it means is it doesn't look as 
good.

502
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,880
Yeah,
exactly.

503
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:17,640
It's not as clear an image.
It's fog,

504
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,680
it's not as foggy.
It's also that you can focus like in 

505
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,280
film you can focus on the guys in the 
foreground,

506
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:25,280
whereas video kind of just captures 
everything.

507
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,100
Right.
And that's what this,

508
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,010
I guess this TV does is it takes each 
frame and makes everything in focus.

509
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,890
So it makes everything seem really 
phony.

510
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:36,400
Like like if you watch loss,
it looks like a soap opera from Mexico.

511
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,920
That's fucking crazy.
It ruins everything.

512
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,320
So I don't know why if Samsung made that
mode,

513
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:43,670
but now I want to make everything look 
fake.

514
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,700
That sounds awesome.
It's,

515
00:22:44,701 --> 00:22:47,110
it's pretty bad man.
It's want that though.

516
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,410
It sounds like it's what's great is 
doing it and not telling somebody and 

517
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:52,410
going,
dude,

518
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,230
what's your favorite movie?
Godfather.

519
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,280
Okay,
let's watch it.

520
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:59,370
Okay.
This doesn't seem as good as I remember 

521
00:22:59,370 --> 00:22:59,370
it.
Like it will make you free.

522
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,500
And he been godfather movies or any 
movie.

523
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,960
So it's some sort of a software thing.
It's a,

524
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:05,920
it's a,
it's a,

525
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,420
it's.
It just takes every frame.

526
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:09,070
Makes it a harder conversion.
Yeah.

527
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:12,090
It's a hardware into the TV.
So the TV is,

528
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,810
is actually making you can take an old 
movie and it will add

529
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,120
frames to it and make the.
It makes it look,

530
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,750
it speeds it up to the point where it 
adds extra frames.

531
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,950
It's kind of like a really fast monitor,
you know?

532
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:30,060
So it doesn't look fast or anything,
but it looks crisper and clearer and it 

533
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,060
looks great.

534
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,230
Is fake.
How much time do you think there is 

535
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,850
before they make movies?
Just completely artificial.

536
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,090
That looked like real movies where it's 
like,

537
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,910
you know,
like,

538
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,980
like a video game,
like video game style.

539
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,680
Like what was that one movie they did 
where they did a whole movie.

540
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:46,010
Like that final fantasy.
Is that what is

541
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,560
a Scifi movie?
But it looked kind of fake,

542
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,620
you know,
kind of goofy fake now to right now it 

543
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:53,620
looks stupid as fuck.
Right.

544
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:53,690
But back then it was like,
wow,

545
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:58,691
this is kind of impressive.
What they did not really good enough 

546
00:23:58,691 --> 00:23:58,691
though to warrant making a whole movie.
Right.

547
00:23:58,691 --> 00:24:03,440
But how many more years it's going to go
by before they can make like Humphrey 

548
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,630
bogart movies,
like make a fake Humphrey bogart movie,

549
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:08,900
recreate his voice,
recreate his intonations is,

550
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,460
you know,
that's gonna Happen,

551
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:11,090
right?
Yeah.

552
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,150
Oh I,
I think it's only a few years off to be 

553
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,411
able to make porn with anybody.
They're going to be able to make any 

554
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:22,960
Sarah Pailin.
Hillary Clinton are going to have 

555
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,451
lesbian porn,
so I'm going to fuck each other and 50 

556
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:25,451
each other.
That's gonna be a video game,

557
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:28,340
choose your character.
Obama looks so realistic,

558
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:33,341
but totally be unrealistic like it could
look exactly like hillary is just armpit

559
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,090
deep into Sarah Palin's pussy.

560
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,290
I mean you can make that splattering.
Just pussy juice all over the website,

561
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,590
splattering pussy juice all over the 
wall when you could.

562
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,860
You're going to be able to recreate.
Beowulf is another one that someone just

563
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:50,450
said that.
Yeah,

564
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,100
it was terrible.
I like that movie.

565
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,600
It was all right,
but it didn't look real.

566
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,120
It didn't look real at all,
but it was cool.

567
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:01,121
It was a fun little fantasy movie.
I think they should have done the Lord 

568
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:01,121
of the rings that way.
Actually,

569
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:02,990
the Lord of the rings like Gollum is 
fake,

570
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:05,330
but everybody else was real.
It's like there's.

571
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,360
There was some fake shit there that was 
hard to swallow even though they were 

572
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,360
awesome movies.
Don't get me wrong.

573
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,970
I think it would have been cooler if the
whole movie was kind of fantasy.

574
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,830
I don't need real actors,
you know,

575
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,630
plus real actress look to human.

576
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,120
To me.
I want it to be fucking weird looking.

577
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:20,900
I want it to,
you know,

578
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:25,901
I don't want you to just be some dude 
wearing like furry shoes that look like 

579
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:25,901
feet,
but yet,

580
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:29,911
yeah,
I just watched that Alice in wonderland 

581
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,811
last night and that,
that was actually kind of cool how they 

582
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:32,060
took real characters,
but they distorted them.

583
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,970
They've made their head's bigger and 
smaller.

584
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,960
It was cool.
Yeah.

585
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,520
The uh,
the main,

586
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,930
uh,
the queen of hearts.

587
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,410
Who was that lady?
What's that lady's name?

588
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,510
Halina.
Bottom corner.

589
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,990
She had the big giant fucking head.
That was pretty trippy.

590
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:50,050
I love that cat to cat was bad.
That was a movie to only go to see if 

591
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,050
you're really high,
you know,

592
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,900
it wasn't,
it was okay.

593
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:55,901
It wasn't a good is not good now.
It was interesting because I was 

594
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,270
barbecued.
I had a pot cookie like an hour before I

595
00:25:57,271 --> 00:26:02,271
went to see that and moving.
So when I went to the movie I was just 

596
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:03,440
was by the time to first frame started 
to fell out full blown.

597
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:08,470
I was like just completely blown out.
So it's fascinating that the cat was 

598
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,740
really interesting,
but like as a,

599
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:11,510
as a,
like a plot and everything.

600
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:13,400
I was like,
so you didn't give a shit.

601
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,680
They didn't give a fuck what happened?
I don't know.

602
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:22,990
But yeah,
getting really baked and watching your 

603
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:22,990
favorite movie and get fucked up by that
motion plus thing.

604
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,320
You should check it out.
Little creepy lab.

605
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Well I can't change my TV.
That seems really know that's what the 

606
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,300
TV for back here.
Three d one.

607
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,680
I don't want to do it.
And,

608
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,940
but you know what's also cool about it 
is how this TV is so connected to the 

609
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,330
Internet.
Like I hit a button and it tells me like

610
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:40,440
Yahoo News,
my Gmail,

611
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,520
my flicker hit another button and I got 
and Amazon video on demand all through 

612
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,820
my TV remote.
Like it's.

613
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,070
Yeah,
mine does that.

614
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,860
My um,
my VCR VCR,

615
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,950
my DVD player can download.
Netflix can store things on Netflix,

616
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:01,190
it can stream things,
it can go to youtube and watch youtube 

617
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,190
clips.
It's pretty crazy.

618
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,800
Yeah,
I like it.

619
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,360
Yeah,
it's the future.

620
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:05,680
So in the future is,
you know,

621
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,730
Shit like this,
I mean probably there's somebody right 

622
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,771
now that can watch this,
there's probably some sort of an 

623
00:27:12,771 --> 00:27:12,771
application,
some sort of a way to watch this on your

624
00:27:12,771 --> 00:27:13,020
actual TV.

625
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,930
Oh totally,
totally.

626
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,620
I mean you can do it on your iphone.
If this was a real TV show,

627
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,700
by the way,
I was watching here,

628
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:22,980
this would be called dead air and people
will be yelling at us.

629
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,910
It was boring as fuck right now son,
I was watching you guys last week on top

630
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:31,911
of a waterfall and it's so weird.
It's like I'm in the middle of nowhere 

631
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:32,640
in Portland,
Oregon watching you on an iphone.

632
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,590
Did you do any math when you were out 
there in Portland?

633
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,060
Oh no,
but tell you what man,

634
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:36,930
Portland,
Oregon.

635
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,160
I was in a costco and I always liked to 
play this game when I'm out of town.

636
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,630
And I was like,
all right,

637
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:46,120
I have 15 minutes to find one person in 
this store that I would,

638
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,340
I would fuck,
you know,

639
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:49,470
like I,
you get to fuck one person in the store,

640
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:49,950
who would it be?

641
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,010
And I could not find one person in that 
store,

642
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:58,011
not even like a mediocre person until 
right when I was walking out one of the 

643
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,200
employees,
she looked like an la too.

644
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:00,870
And I was like,
okay,

645
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:03,780
I'll pick her because I have to pay to 
fuck that one.

646
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,920
Wow.
Well,

647
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:06,570
you maybe you have really high 
standards.

648
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,230
No,
no.

649
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:11,160
I mean it's.
Every single person in Portland is fat.

650
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,540
They're,
uh,

651
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,910
they looked very depressed and sad.
Uh,

652
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,770
they,
they just.

653
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:22,070
And again,
I guess it's the meth capital of the 

654
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,070
world,
but yet nature everywhere.

655
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,070
Beautiful.
Everywhere you go.

656
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,540
Amazing hot people that live in 
Portland.

657
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,940
Don't feel bad for Brian.
Doesn't want to fuck you.

658
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,660
I didn't meet.
I didn't,

659
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,570
I did not meet you.
Now you might be the shit.

660
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:32,460
He might've just got to a real ugly 
spot.

661
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,040
Tons of armpit.
Harrison,

662
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,590
all the chicks.

663
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,070
What do you think though about all the,
uh,

664
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:41,150
not only that I've heard a lot of leg 
hair to was something I read on forums 

665
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,600
where women were complaining saying that
men should know that women have hair on 

666
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,990
their legs and armpits.
This is silly.

667
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,610
Yeah,
I went to a Sushi place,

668
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,690
first Sushi place I've ever been to 
where they gave you forks and then I was

669
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:51,980
like,
wait,

670
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,450
wait,
where's the chopsticks?

671
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,540
And I had to go to like the hostess 
stand and it had been looked for 

672
00:28:59,540 --> 00:28:59,540
chopsticks at a Sushi place.
Like they were like,

673
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,460
oh America son,
I know,

674
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:04,050
but what?
I'm fucking go back to China.

675
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:09,051
You can use those chopsticks.
That's what kind of Sushi place they 

676
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:09,051
have their,
what do you think about all those people

677
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:10,170
that get depressed?
We want to kill themselves because it's,

678
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:13,170
you know,
75 days a year.

679
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,500
I believe it.
I lived in Ohio and it was like that 

680
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,620
everyday and I wanted to kill myself and
I just wanted to go to work and get done

681
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:24,621
with the day and go back home and play 
on the Internet and that was because it 

682
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:24,621
was cloudy.
It was just discussed.

683
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,270
Great.
Everyday that sky was gray.

684
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,360
I would say 50 percent.
Sixty percent of the days were gray.

685
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:35,430
The other were like partly cloudy to 
sunny,

686
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,770
you know,
but 60 percent was like gray sky,

687
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,420
like nothing.
Just death.

688
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,530
I've been there,
man,

689
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:42,220
I've been to Columbus a bunch of times

690
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,810
doing stand up and that's what I've 
found.

691
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:49,180
It's a real gray there.
There's a bunch of parts of the country 

692
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,080
that are just real gray for like a long 
part of the year.

693
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,890
That shit ain't good for you now.
It's not sucks.

694
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,940
It's weird,
right?

695
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:56,590
We're,
we're kind of programmed,

696
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:02,010
you know,
the human body needs a certain amount 

697
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:02,010
from its environment and one of the 
things we need is sunlight.

698
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,630
We literally need sunlight for vitamins.
We need it for vitamin D,

699
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,840
but we also needed for happiness.
There's something about skies that are 

700
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,221
gloomy,
that are depressing and it's encoded 

701
00:30:14,221 --> 00:30:14,980
into your DNA.
It's like your DNA is telling you,

702
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,210
hey,
you're,

703
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:18,490
you're living in a place where it's 
going to be uncomfortable.

704
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,670
You're going to get drenched.
You're not going to get that vitamin D 

705
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:23,920
that you need,
but if you can get past that,

706
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:24,970
you'll be okay.

707
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,890
If you can go to the sun and get the 
sunny parts,

708
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,380
then you'll be happy.
Like you can literally literally changes

709
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:32,050
your state to be indifferent.
Whether you know,

710
00:30:32,051 --> 00:30:35,230
like,
physically changes it and if you live in

711
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:37,390
a place where it's just you don't get 
that son,

712
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,250
you don't get enough of that son.
Yeah.

713
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,680
And it's also different.
People have different needs to.

714
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:43,390
I think genetically,
you know,

715
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:46,060
I bet if you're black,
I bet living in a place where it's never

716
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:47,530
sunny,
it was fucking terrible.

717
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,220
I bet it's terrible for you because like
the whole dark skin and dark skin,

718
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:55,150
it's supposed to be in response to 
bright sun and you know,

719
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:57,460
living in a hot climate.
So yeah,

720
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,470
dark skinned like Brazil,
you know,

721
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:02,350
they're dark skinned and that's supposed
to be because they have to deal with the

722
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:03,820
hot sun and,
and you know,

723
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:06,820
and that kind of a climate.
And if you go to places like Siberia,

724
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:11,821
people are pretty fucking white just 
because no one's ever outside in the 

725
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:11,821
sun.
You know what I mean?

726
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:11,821
It's like you,
you,

727
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,050
you get,
you grow accustomed to it.

728
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:16,240
So maybe if you're a person that like,
you know,

729
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,320
it's got super pale skin,
it would be way easier to live in a 

730
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,490
place where it doesn't get sunny.
You know,

731
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:23,200
maybe there's like genetic needs.

732
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:23,840
Hmm.

733
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,930
Very possible.
Right.

734
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:26,750
I mean,
I,

735
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,470
I wish I knew about those lights before 
that when I lived in Ohio.

736
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,900
Like there's the sunlight lights.
Have you heard of those?

737
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,520
Who knows?
There'll artificial lights.

738
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,500
The lights.
Yeah.

739
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,850
They have alarm clocks.
They have that built into them too.

740
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,560
I really,
I was thinking about getting one.

741
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:40,840
That's a trick though.
How the fuck would that be?

742
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:45,841
As good as going outside on a sunny day.
Some days are awesome because everybody 

743
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:46,460
else is happy to.
I guess that's tricky.

744
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,770
When I lived in Boston,
I,

745
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:49,690
I appreciate the fuck.
I live sunny days,

746
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,020
but now in la you're just so used to it.
It's like sunny days or just what you 

747
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,020
get every day.
Yeah.

748
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,361
It's actually the opposite today.
It's cloudy and you get fired up when 

749
00:31:59,361 --> 00:31:59,361
it's cloudy,
you get,

750
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:03,181
Oh,
we're going to get some nice rain 

751
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:03,700
because it literally is sunny here.
Three hundred and 60 days a year almost.

752
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,140
I mean,
it's fucking crazy.

753
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:06,280
I mean how many,
how many days a year?

754
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,920
I'm exaggerating,
but it's maybe three.

755
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,340
20,
right.

756
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,680
It's pretty high.
Definitely.

757
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,410
Was like a month though that it rains 
like every day sometimes.

758
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:16,810
Like every other year.
Tiers.

759
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,400
Yeah,
it's fucked up.

760
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,430
You can.
You can get used to that.

761
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,100
Yeah.

762
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:28,390
But it's a terrible for your skin.
You know in Australia when I was in 

763
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,541
Australia,
they have all these ads for skin cancer 

764
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:31,541
because Australia doesn't have a fucking
ozone layer.

765
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,900
Remember when there was the big hole in 
the ozone layer?

766
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:37,901
Worry.
Well it's all over Australia and 

767
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:40,421
apparently Australia doesn't give a shit
but they have all these ads everywhere 

768
00:32:40,421 --> 00:32:43,451
you go.
I'm being careful because if you go 

769
00:32:43,451 --> 00:32:44,090
outside without sunscreen on,
you could get skin cancer.

770
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:49,091
So they have these really graphic skin 
cancer ads on the side of buses or 

771
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:51,800
stitches and shit and see big pieces of 
meat cut out of people.

772
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,010
I hate that.
Like or when it gets cigarettes and like

773
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,480
Canada and it shows like some guy with 
throat cancer on the back of your box.

774
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:57,690
Yeah.

775
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,130
Just like rough about that too.
You see people smoking in England,

776
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:05,010
they have big giant warnings in the back
of their cigarettes.

777
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,140
But you need that son look at you.
You got,

778
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:10,010
you got illnesses right now.
You ready to die?

779
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,760
Brian's been shitting blood.

780
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,520
No,
it's in black.

781
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,340
It's blood right,
isn't a blood stomach ulcers.

782
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,030
Brian's got a stomach ulcer.
He's fucked.

783
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,410
It's great.
I have this doctor that I was talking to

784
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,570
today and he's just like a,
so what?

785
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,010
Your stool is black?
And I'm like,

786
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:26,910
yeah,
it's last night.

787
00:33:26,911 --> 00:33:31,911
I felt like I was gonna throw up.
I have an eight and 24 hours and I feel 

788
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:33,240
really light headed and my stool is 
black.

789
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,650
And he goes,
man,

790
00:33:34,651 --> 00:33:36,510
we need to get you to the emergency room
quick.

791
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,650
All right,
I'm going to call you back and schedule 

792
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:41,650
an appointment.
And I'm like,

793
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:41,650
okay,
okay.

794
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,961
And he's like,
and you're not going to have to drive 

795
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:44,961
home.
I'm like,

796
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:44,961
all right,
that's cool.

797
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:44,961
Four hours,
five hours later.

798
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:45,060
He hasn't called me back,

799
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,610
so this is going on right now as we 
speak.

800
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,500
I might just die,
right?

801
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:53,530
Kind of a trooper is Brian.
This dude is bleeding out of his 

802
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:53,530
butthole and then just hanging out.

803
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,770
It might be stomach cancer.
Somebody just sit.

804
00:33:56,771 --> 00:33:57,520
It might be cancer.

805
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,750
I don't think it's cancer.
You don't smell like you got cancer.

806
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,200
Smell like you got some your dogs that 
you said.

807
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:07,790
Let your dogs smell nice ground at your 
asshole.

808
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,530
Like angry.
Imagine that dog locks on your ass.

809
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,480
It's happened.
It's happened before.

810
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,970
There's dogs that can smell cancer.
They can.

811
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,330
They can take test tubes and lines like,
you know,

812
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,360
they did this test with them where they 
just have this big giant like 20 yard 

813
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,400
line and down the line and there's a 
different test tube and you know,

814
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:35,730
at increments and each different tests 
who has a different thing in it and then

815
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,400
they'll go right to the ones with cancer
and they bark.

816
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,840
That's crazy.
That's nuts.

817
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:41,310
They can smell fucking cancer.

818
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:47,130
I love that.
I love that whole thing where there's 

819
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:47,130
stuff we don't know about.
Things like dogs and like that.

820
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,930
Just that they know that.
And like earthquakes.

821
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,310
Just the fact.
Yeah,

822
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,800
they,
they,

823
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,530
they,
they know tsunamis are coming.

824
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,560
They go run in the Thailand tsunami,
that last big one that happened.

825
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,640
Very few animals tied.
Man Deanna,

826
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,470
if,
if any.

827
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:05,830
I think the animals all escaped.
They all saw common and got the fuck out

828
00:35:05,831 --> 00:35:06,910
of dodge,
like way,

829
00:35:06,911 --> 00:35:09,670
way in advance because they don't have a
language.

830
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,910
I think that the earth itself probably 
has some sort of a language and if you 

831
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,760
have a language yourself,
you know,

832
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:18,010
like human beings do and we have this 
ability to communicate.

833
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:21,610
We're so wrapped up and communicating 
with ourselves that we don't receive any

834
00:35:21,611 --> 00:35:24,730
communication from animals or plants or 
from the world.

835
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,550
You know,
I'm not talking about like,

836
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:31,620
like words like dogs talk to you,
but did you ever meet a dog and you 

837
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:31,620
know,
you can't fuck with his dog.

838
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,850
He never meet a dog and you're like,
what's going on buddy?

839
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,530
And you're looking at him and he's 
looking at you and you're like,

840
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:37,470
okay,
let me get the fuck from you.

841
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,080
That dog is sending.
There's somehow or another.

842
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:42,900
I mean it's not even his,
his demeanor.

843
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:44,820
He's not growling at you.
He,

844
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:47,850
but he's just giving you a look and 
you're getting a message.

845
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,890
You,
he's communicating with you,

846
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:51,710
but you got all sorts of shit inside 
your head.

847
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,020
The stock market and your divorce and 
your fucking homework.

848
00:35:55,021 --> 00:36:00,021
And this and that and language and 
English and I'm learning Spanish and 

849
00:36:00,021 --> 00:36:00,270
you've got all this shit going on in 
your head.

850
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,780
I bet the earth itself actually has like
some sort of a way of communicating 

851
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:11,001
with,
with beings and with animals that don't 

852
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:13,851
have languages.
Like they can tune into shit that we 

853
00:36:13,851 --> 00:36:13,851
can't tune into.
You know,

854
00:36:13,851 --> 00:36:15,990
how dogs can smell things and tune into 
things.

855
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:17,790
And I mean they have a super,
super,

856
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,110
super powered senses.

857
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,690
Yep.
They can sense that they,

858
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,590
that if they have cancer,
you know.

859
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,850
Right.
Well that's.

860
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,960
Maybe they can,
you know,

861
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,430
maybe we don't.
They just can't communicate.

862
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,570
Yeah.
You know,

863
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,280
but dumb dogs,
you know,

864
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,790
it's funny when,
when,

865
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,300
when the doctor is asking me if it was 
black and I'm like,

866
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:35,710
I don't know,
it's like very dark,

867
00:36:35,711 --> 00:36:36,470
dark brown.
He goes,

868
00:36:36,471 --> 00:36:39,700
well dark brown and black is completely 
different and I'm like,

869
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,260
it's not really different.
I'm like,

870
00:36:41,261 --> 00:36:42,580
do you want me to take a photo of it?
He goes,

871
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,810
no,
that's not necessary.

872
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,420
Like,
well are you talking about $10,000

873
00:36:46,421 --> 00:36:47,590
difference?
Like if I say no,

874
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:52,591
it's black,
or are you gonna like make me go to the 

875
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:53,050
hospital and do all this shit.
That's why I just don't get doctors,

876
00:36:53,051 --> 00:36:54,040
you know,
that's like,

877
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,070
while he's just probably tired of 
people,

878
00:36:56,071 --> 00:37:01,071
man.
Do everyday deals with people that are 

879
00:37:01,071 --> 00:37:01,071
broken.
Could you imagine what that'd be like?

880
00:37:01,071 --> 00:37:05,270
That'd be like psychology.
I was a psych major for awhile in 

881
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,410
college and I was thinking like maybe 
there should be a psychologist.

882
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:10,560
I give people good advice and then I 
thought about it and I was like,

883
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,520
you're going to be dealing with fucked 
up people every day.

884
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,490
Every day you're on fucked up energy and
the best you can do with these people is

885
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:19,200
make them not fucked up.
You know,

886
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:24,201
that's the best you can do,
but you're not getting any fucking 

887
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,620
happiness and joy and excitement and all
powerful feelings all day.

888
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:26,940
Creativity,
you know,

889
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,120
you're just dealing with fucked up 
people and some people want to do that.

890
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:31,950
Some people want to help you,
good on you,

891
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,900
good on you.
But man,

892
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,690
that would have to be a fuck

893
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,870
drag.
And also in La,

894
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:38,500
I think it's completely worse,
like if

895
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,620
so self indulgent out here.
Yeah.

896
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,580
And plus there's just so many people,
so many people and so many people trying

897
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:46,530
to do something completely unrealistic.
Right?

898
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,300
How many people out here want to be 
famous,

899
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:53,660
you know,
and I live out in the burbs and you run 

900
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:53,660
into people and you don't think that 
they're the type.

901
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,890
And then as you get to know them,
you find out,

902
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:57,450
oh,
I came out here to be an actor.

903
00:37:57,451 --> 00:37:59,370
It didn't work out.
And then I got into plumbing,

904
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,550
you know,
hey,

905
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,100
you know,
I was wanting to be an actor.

906
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:04,000
I always wanted to do this.
And how'd you get your spot?

907
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,250
What?
I always wanted to do that,

908
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:05,760
man,
how'd you get?

909
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,560
How'd you get on that show?
I just wanting to do that.

910
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:09,000
And you find out that like literally 
like,

911
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:14,390
you know,
the percentage of people that move out 

912
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:14,820
here for even in the back of their hand,
they have some weird show Biz dream.

913
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,220
It's like fucking 60 percent,
you know,

914
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:21,060
that's a completely unrealistic number.
If you think about how many people there

915
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:23,430
are out there that actually become 
famous from acting,

916
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,640
especially acting man,
I mean it's fucking who.

917
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,950
Who's to say you're a good actor.
I had a hell.

918
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,170
You get good at pretending to be someone
you're not.

919
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:33,210
You know what I mean?
I guess there's some methods to it and I

920
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,710
guess you know,
it all depends on personality,

921
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:37,390
what kind of energy you're packing 
inside of you,

922
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:41,440
but then somebody has to agree to put 
you in a movie and somebody has to agree

923
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:44,170
they like you and what are the odds 
that's going to happen?

924
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,720
Fuck man.
So those people are.

925
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:51,670
All they have is an unrealized dreams 
and that fucking chips away at them.

926
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:53,890
And then the reason why they wanted to 
be actors in the first place,

927
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:58,891
a lot of,
almost they're fucked up because they 

928
00:38:58,891 --> 00:38:58,891
didn't get any attention as a chat.

929
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,860
Woo.
I coughed up.

930
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:05,280
I was getting broken up with a story.
They didn't get any attention as a 

931
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,341
child,
which is the same reason why people 

932
00:39:08,341 --> 00:39:09,651
become comedians and you know,
any kind of extreme attention performer 

933
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:09,651
like that,
you know.

934
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:13,921
So then you're,
you're dealing with like so many people 

935
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:14,080
with that.
So many people with problems,

936
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,200
so many people that need to be fixed.
Just give him some pills,

937
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,730
just give them a fucking pill and shut 
them up.

938
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You know,
after a while I think these doctors 

939
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,000
could just tired,
just tired of dealing with shit.

940
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,980
Could you imagine being the guy who has 
to deal with your problem every day?

941
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:32,080
Every everyday someone comes to them and
has got some sort of an ulcer or 

942
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,130
something.
See when it's like a butt doctor.

943
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,680
And can you imagine what that is like 
seeing buttholes all day?

944
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:41,710
You gotta fix him.
Nobody's coming in with the perfect 

945
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:41,710
butthole and you're like,
I have good news for you.

946
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,220
Your butthole is perfect.
Now if you're going to see the doctor,

947
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:46,910
you got a butthole problem.
Yeah.

948
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,310
Fuck.
You could be dehydrated.

949
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:54,010
It depends what color your shit was.
Do you drink a lot of water?

950
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,020
Yeah.
I had two gatorades already today,

951
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:57,510
so I'm not dehydrated.
That's not.

952
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,520
When did you know that you could pinch 
your hand and you can tell if you're 

953
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:02,520
dehydrated.
If your skin goes back slower,

954
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,310
you know,
did you know that?

955
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,930
That's a good way to tell if you're 
dehydrated.

956
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:06,610
I've heard about that from dudes to cut 
weight.

957
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:07,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

958
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:11,950
When they know that they're ready to die
has been cut so much weight that their,

959
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,870
their body's failing on them.
Well,

960
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,630
a lot of guys who cut weight get really 
crazy with it.

961
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,460
Like um,
they'll go down from like,

962
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:21,730
you know,
there's dudes that go from well over 200

963
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:23,950
pounds and they go all the way down to 
one 70.

964
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,850
Tiago Alvarez.
You've seen that guy before,

965
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:29,860
right?
He's huge.

966
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:35,070
When I stand next to that guy,
I can not believe that that guy gets to 

967
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,490
170 pounds.
He's so much bigger than me.

968
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,540
I weigh 185 pounds and that guy is way 
bigger than me.

969
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:45,570
He is gigantic and somehow know that 
heat dries himself out totally to one 

970
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,840
70,
gets on the scale and then rehydrates 

971
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,300
and gets to like 200 pounds by the time 
it comes to fight.

972
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,670
That's crazy.
I don't know how they do it.

973
00:40:55,350 --> 00:41:00,350
I don't know how they do it,
but it's dangerous and when dudes are 

974
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,990
like at that last drop,
you know what I mean?

975
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,250
Tiago has never looked bad,
but I've seen some guys look real bad.

976
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:11,251
I was like Travis Luder once didn't make
weight for the Anderson Silva fight and 

977
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:14,641
he was trying to try and try,
but he could not cut the weight for 

978
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:17,131
whatever reason and he's walking towards
the scale and he was shuffling because 

979
00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:18,190
he couldn't even pick his feet up and 
his cheeks were all sunken in.

980
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:23,220
He looked like he was going to die.
He's lips were all chapped and broken 

981
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,220
and I was like,
whoa.

982
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,420
Like this dude looks like he's in a 
goddamn concentration camp.

983
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:30,450
This is crazy.
All just to be bigger than the other 

984
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:30,820
guy.
What are you doing,

985
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,740
man in the head?
You're going to die losing composure,

986
00:41:34,741 --> 00:41:36,110
son.
Pull it together.

987
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,430
Pull it together.
Boy.

988
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,040
So I'm wanting to talk about that.
A,

989
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,260
the Miss America,
Miss USA.

990
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:44,660
You don't want to confuse them because 
apparently ones legit.

991
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,000
Mrs.
Rogan was telling me that one of them is

992
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:52,001
legit.
One of them's important and the other 

993
00:41:52,001 --> 00:41:53,020
one's silly ones like which one?
Trombone.

994
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:58,430
Then the fucking same thing to me.
I don't see how Miss America or Miss 

995
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:03,011
USA,
but I guess one of them is like the 

996
00:42:03,011 --> 00:42:04,961
cooler one and like Ms Dot USA wishes 
she was Miss America or Miss America 

997
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:09,371
wishes.
She was at Ms Dot USA and the other one 

998
00:42:09,371 --> 00:42:09,371
is like cheesy.

999
00:42:09,371 --> 00:42:12,820
Yeah.
Once I hooter girls I heard one of them 

1000
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,431
I think has.
You have to like talk and give like a 

1001
00:42:15,431 --> 00:42:19,030
speech and shit.
And the other one you just fucking 

1002
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,390
flirtier baton and miss.
What's it called?

1003
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,110
Flip your.
What's the word pure for protons.

1004
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:29,230
Flip your lid.
They're all they are is who I'd most 

1005
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,850
like to fuck contest.
And the fact that we still give a shit.

1006
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,070
Who Wins?
The WHO I'd most like to fuck contest in

1007
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:36,440
2010.
That's very strange.

1008
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,650
You know.
And this one is very controversial 

1009
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,230
because the last woman who is in the big
controversial was that carry predawn 

1010
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,980
chick who hated gays or didn't want them
to get married or whatever.

1011
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,010
She didn't hate gays.
I mean,

1012
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,390
I'm just putting words in her mouth.
She was just upset.

1013
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,320
She only wants.
She only thought regular marriage.

1014
00:42:55,321 --> 00:43:00,321
She wasn't.
She was opposed to opposite marriage or 

1015
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:01,010
she was opposed to to,
to same sex marriage,

1016
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,890
but she supported opposite sex marriage.

1017
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,380
That's it.
That's how she described it.

1018
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:08,620
Like opposite marriage as a train wreck.
Well,

1019
00:43:08,621 --> 00:43:10,880
and she was just a dumb check who's hot.
You know,

1020
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,410
if you're a dumb chicken,
you're hot.

1021
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,510
How hard is it to have your shit 
together?

1022
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,460
Virtually impossible.
You know,

1023
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,460
you're around people that tell you 
you're awesome all day long.

1024
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,050
Everybody wants to fuck you.
You have.

1025
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,370
You don't even know what color the sky 
is.

1026
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,620
What the fuck do you know?
You know,

1027
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,480
could you imagine what it must be like?
Like how,

1028
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,500
how hard is it to be enlightened and to 
be free and to be like without ego.

1029
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:35,720
If you're a hot chick in,
let your twenties,

1030
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:39,320
dude,
everywhere you go,

1031
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:44,710
everyone treats you.
Like you have the Willy Wonka golden 

1032
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,170
ticket.
Everywhere you go,

1033
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,590
guys are willing to leave their wives.
They're tripping over themselves,

1034
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:54,200
trying to buy you things or trying to 
take you out everywhere you go.

1035
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:58,160
That's sex dating as girls too.
Why is this?

1036
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,020
Because then they're still used to a 
certain way that you're.

1037
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,380
You know what I mean?
I can keep the pimp hand strong,

1038
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:04,480
son.
You got fuck them.

1039
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:07,100
Right.
And then don't call them to make them.

1040
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:09,440
Make them know that the game's different
now.

1041
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:12,560
Okay?
I'm not that 60 year old man that bought

1042
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:14,210
you a Ferrari.
All right,

1043
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,770
I'm here to give you some Dick and then 
we're on equal terms.

1044
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,010
I'm not.
We're not getting crazy.

1045
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,250
I'll have to buy you things.
Settle the fuck down.

1046
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,340
They'll get mad if you don't buy them 
things though,

1047
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:27,230
right?
You don't care.

1048
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,540
The last boyfriend cared liquid.
He bought her.

1049
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:34,560
He bought all these diamonds.
He her all these things and they get to 

1050
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,580
walk around with them and the walking 
around with them.

1051
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:40,581
It's very important.
It's more important than having them to 

1052
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:41,310
want everybody to see that someone loves
them so much.

1053
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,740
They spent all this fucking money so 
that miss year,

1054
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,930
so I check that she was a big problem 
because she,

1055
00:44:47,931 --> 00:44:50,850
she didn't like the gate,
so the fucking Christian's got all crazy

1056
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:51,990
weather and they were like,
yes,

1057
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:54,630
you're on our side.
Then it turned out she did some porn.

1058
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,660
She made her own home movies with the 
big Dildo and shit.

1059
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:59,810
She was had a Dildo in her ass or 
something.

1060
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,610
There's all these different versions of 
what actually happened,

1061
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:07,730
but she went into sue.
She was trying to sue Miss USA and she 

1062
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:07,730
was like talking crazy lawsuit talk and 
they're like,

1063
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:12,710
really want you to sit the fuck down?
We're going to show you this video of 

1064
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,821
you with a big black rubber dick in your
ass hole or whatever happened is strap 

1065
00:45:16,821 --> 00:45:16,821
on.
I don't know.

1066
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,620
We just should clarify for the 
broadcast.

1067
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,600
We don't know what exactly was on that 
tape,

1068
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:24,600
but apparently it was some,
some shit that you're not supposed to do

1069
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:26,370
if you're Miss USA,
which is hilarious.

1070
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:31,490
You're in a who I'd most like to fuck 
contest and it can even be a video of 

1071
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,100
you out there.
Fucking we can assume that you fuck,

1072
00:45:32,101 --> 00:45:37,101
but if you capture on video that's,
that's in violation and you're gonna 

1073
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:41,720
attract undue attention to our cause.
Our cause of the miss who I most like to

1074
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:45,720
fuck contest.
Like what the fuck is wrong with people.

1075
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,920
When I was in high school,
I would go to hooters and just be 

1076
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,690
complete assholes.
We would like all right,

1077
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,840
since it's called hooters,
we're allowed to look at their hooters 

1078
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,180
so we're just going to go in there and 
stare at their hooters and not even look

1079
00:45:57,181 --> 00:46:00,240
at their face as a joke.
Let's do old 15,

1080
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:05,241
16 years old.
And so we just go there and take the 

1081
00:46:05,241 --> 00:46:07,671
whole time just staring at their tits.
I hope you feel bad about that and I do 

1082
00:46:07,671 --> 00:46:07,671
feel bad about it.

1083
00:46:07,671 --> 00:46:12,650
When you get really stoned as it haunt 
you does when you eat like a Brownie 

1084
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:17,540
chicken wing,
you ever eat a Brownie and in your 

1085
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:17,540
childhood haunt you and you think did 
some Douchey Shit?

1086
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:21,750
When I was in eighth grade,
it was like the baby cardinal once where

1087
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:23,550
it was like fell out of his tree and I 
was hurt.

1088
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,370
I just remember being a kid throwing 
rocks at it and I'm just like,

1089
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,970
haunts me like little cardinal.
Yeah.

1090
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:34,430
Me and my friend Tim,
we went hunting for squirrels and uh,

1091
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:40,230
no it was my friend David.
We went hunting for squirrels with 

1092
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,981
slingshots and we tagged the squirrel 
and he fell out of the tree and then we 

1093
00:46:42,981 --> 00:46:44,610
killed him and I was like,
what the fuck are we doing?

1094
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,940
Like why are we killing the squirrel?
The Squirrel didn't do shit to me,

1095
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:53,360
you know,
it's just like we wanted to see if we 

1096
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:53,360
could do it.
And we did it,

1097
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:53,940
you know,
we played baseball,

1098
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:55,860
throwing baseballs at squirrels on power
lines.

1099
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,990
Oh Dude.

1100
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,140
It's so fucked up.
The things you do,

1101
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:03,510
like,
you're so inconsiderate when you're 15,

1102
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,060
you know?
And then I don't think I was 15.

1103
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:08,700
I was 14 and I never did it again.
I was like,

1104
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:13,730
God,
I was like one thing about eating that 

1105
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,351
squirrel,
but I just killed that squirrel with a 

1106
00:47:15,351 --> 00:47:15,351
marble.
I shot him in a marble,

1107
00:47:15,351 --> 00:47:15,450
like,
for what?

1108
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:17,250
What the hell?
How stupid is that?

1109
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,240
You know,
there'll be,

1110
00:47:18,241 --> 00:47:23,241
you know,
you learn from those experiences and 

1111
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:23,241
then you know,
you learn from that terrible feeling and

1112
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:23,790
you never do it again.
But God,

1113
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:26,100
I wish I didn't have to do it in the 
first place to learn that.

1114
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:28,860
You know,
some people are so fucking

1115
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,930
like some people,
like how many people do you see?

1116
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:36,931
Just throwing cigarettes out the window.
We were talking about that this all the 

1117
00:47:36,931 --> 00:47:36,931
time.
All the time.

1118
00:47:36,931 --> 00:47:37,250
That's so inconsiderate,
man.

1119
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,540
Funny.
I used to do it though.

1120
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,340
That really sucked.
When did you stop doing it?

1121
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,810
When he moved to California.
Really?

1122
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:46,150
Yeah.
It's like a California thing I think.

1123
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,680
Why did California make you stop doing 
it?

1124
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:52,710
Because in Ohio it was normal.
It was normal and in California cops 

1125
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,590
would do it.
Oh really?

1126
00:47:54,591 --> 00:47:59,591
Yeah.
Cops that you would be smoking a 

1127
00:47:59,591 --> 00:47:59,591
cigarette while they're writing you a 
ticket and just flick it on the ground.

1128
00:47:59,591 --> 00:47:59,740
Do you know who the fuck is?
That is?

1129
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,340
What is it about smokers that makes them
think that the world is the garbage?

1130
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:06,230
Because up to recently that was normal.
You know,

1131
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,890
but why is that normal?
Why is it normal?

1132
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,770
I had a friend who used to do it.
He'll say a fucking taxes.

1133
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:13,780
They pay to clean the streets.
Like that was his thing.

1134
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,000
He would smoke.
He'd flick it on the ground and I go,

1135
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:17,490
why don't you just pick that up?
Why do you,

1136
00:48:17,491 --> 00:48:18,850
why do you have to throw that on the 
ground?

1137
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:19,270
I was like,
Hey,

1138
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:22,010
fucking taxes.
This is a guy whose job is it because it

1139
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,620
decomposes?
Is that what it is?

1140
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,050
Like compose.
Oh man,

1141
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:27,880
there's a fucking.
There's plastic in that thing.

1142
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:32,881
Who knows what the goddamn shelf life is
on a cigarette filter because I mean 

1143
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:36,181
like you know how you can like throw 
like a banana out the window and that's 

1144
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:37,660
an organic thing.
I never had a cigarette filter is not an

1145
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:42,661
organic thing.
I mean there may be biodegradable 

1146
00:48:42,661 --> 00:48:42,661
cigarette filters,
but when,

1147
00:48:42,661 --> 00:48:43,210
how long does it take them?

1148
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,290
How many of them are biodegradable and 
how long does it take them to dissolve?

1149
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,960
Flicking her cigarette out.
The window creates jobs.

1150
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,560
Yeah,
that's what my friends are good.

1151
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:55,150
Was someone saying that on twitter?
That's what my friend's argument was.

1152
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,810
It was a fucking guy justice for a 
living.

1153
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,270
What he does,
just to clean it up,

1154
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,990
is his argument was that there's 
somebody gets paid to do it,

1155
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:03,550
so it's like cleaning up at a 
restaurant,

1156
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,420
washing you clean up,
you know,

1157
00:49:05,421 --> 00:49:07,150
you don't clean up the waitresses there 
to clean up.

1158
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:08,140
That's her job.
His,

1159
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:10,720
he thought the city streets where there 
to be clean,

1160
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:13,000
so he would just flick his,
his ashes everywhere.

1161
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,130
Yeah.
I guess I never got.

1162
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,980
I never understood.
I just did just did it because everybody

1163
00:49:17,981 --> 00:49:20,380
else did.
When did you start to feel bad about it?

1164
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:21,790
You?
The one that made me feel bad about.

1165
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,080
Because when we were at the comedy 
store,

1166
00:49:23,081 --> 00:49:24,310
I flipped on the ground and you're just 
like,

1167
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:25,260
pick that up.
What the fuck?

1168
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:26,230
He took women and I'm like,
what?

1169
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,050
What are you talking about?
You just don't throw it on the ground.

1170
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:30,970
And it was you who were like,
I don't think really.

1171
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,080
Yeah man,
I haven't.

1172
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,710
You're the first person to say it that 
way.

1173
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:38,030
Like ever.
No one ever told you not to litter.

1174
00:49:38,031 --> 00:49:41,040
That's ever.
Not from that cigarettes really ever.

1175
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,650
You're the first person to ever do that.
I'm very,

1176
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:49,270
um,
I'm very sensitive about like mess,

1177
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,300
like leaving a mess.
Like I don't ever want to inconvenience 

1178
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:54,700
other people because I'm lazy and then 
consider it.

1179
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:58,360
So it's like I don't ever like throw 
garbage on the ground.

1180
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:03,540
If I dropped something I'll chase after 
a little receipt because I want to make 

1181
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:03,970
sure that I picked that up and throw it 
out.

1182
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:04,810
You know,
I,

1183
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:08,890
I'm very sensitive about that shit.
I just think that that's a gross fucking

1184
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,980
characteristic of human beings.
I don't ever want to see that in myself.

1185
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,650
That inconsiderate like lazy litterer 
know.

1186
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:20,680
It's just a gross characteristic.
Like we need to fucking move past that.

1187
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:25,720
I see people in fucking hybrid cars all 
the time.

1188
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:28,400
Flicking cigarettes the window.
That drives me nuts.

1189
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,760
I was talking about that.
I did a whole thing about it like a year

1190
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,760
and a half ago in San Francisco.
I was screaming at them because I saw 

1191
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,960
like four of them in a day for guys and 
hybrid cars just throwing cigarettes out

1192
00:50:38,961 --> 00:50:39,530
the window.
It's like,

1193
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,750
this is,
this is ridiculous.

1194
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:42,050
Like,
what,

1195
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,830
what the fuck are you doing?
What,

1196
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,230
what makes you think that that's okay.
You know,

1197
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:46,790
you're,
you're,

1198
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:49,820
you're fighting the oil companies and 
you're trying to be conservative and you

1199
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:54,821
know,
with gasoline and everything like that 

1200
00:50:54,821 --> 00:50:55,550
and make sure that you leave a small 
footprint and you're throwing cigarettes

1201
00:50:55,551 --> 00:50:57,410
out the window.
It's weird.

1202
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:59,510
I'm like that with a lot of things where
I'm like,

1203
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,610
I'm ashamed of myself and how I act 
like,

1204
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:03,910
especially when I'm in a hotel room and 
I like flipped.

1205
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,300
Come on the walls and stuff.
I'm like,

1206
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:05,990
yeah,
fuck this.

1207
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,100
Come on.
Do that.

1208
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,470
Yeah.
I don't know why you did that.

1209
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,270
Still get all the time.
Oh,

1210
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:14,150
you're gross.
That's what the deal is,

1211
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,940
is a reason why hotel room has so many 
washcloths.

1212
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Okay,
so you supposed to come in a few of 

1213
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,561
those.
You're not supposed to be flicking on 

1214
00:51:23,561 --> 00:51:23,561
walls.
I can't do it at home.

1215
00:51:23,561 --> 00:51:24,060
You know what I mean?
I'm like,

1216
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,310
Yo,
I went through my career everywhere.

1217
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,650
If you've ever seen those,
uh,

1218
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,510
television shows,
like inside edition or whatever the fuck

1219
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:29,990
they are,
you know,

1220
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,330
with a 20,
20 where they go to hotel rooms,

1221
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:35,780
we're going to take you into hotel and 
find out what's really going on and they

1222
00:51:35,781 --> 00:51:39,110
use a black light and they find ges 
everywhere to Tj's.

1223
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,180
And then on the glasses,
I guess those glasses,

1224
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,110
they don't really clean them.

1225
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:47,110
It's just like that.
The woman like rinses it out and then 

1226
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:47,540
puts the thing on it.
So I guess they did it.

1227
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:50,940
They swapped all these glasses and like 
90 percent of the glasses,

1228
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:55,460
like had fecal matter on the fucking 
black light to this one,

1229
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:58,520
a comforter and it looks like a Jackson 
pollock painting.

1230
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:03,910
It was just all just,
it was just dried judges all over this 

1231
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,110
fucking thing.
It was like a God,

1232
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,480
that constellation.
It was disgusting.

1233
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:13,540
It was just loads all over it.
And they were like talking about what 

1234
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,270
the different things was.
This is blood,

1235
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:19,510
this is pro,
and they were saying that it was one of 

1236
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:19,510
them was period blood.
They were very specific.

1237
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,980
This is menstrual blood.
Most likely this is,

1238
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,500
this is sperm.
Like what the fuck?

1239
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,300
You know,
if you think about it,

1240
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:27,350
that's what you're sleeping in.

1241
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,220
You know what?
All the lows that you've blown on,

1242
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:34,430
hotel sheets and those sheets just get 
washed.

1243
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,010
They probably do a shitty.
What's crazy is they don't even wash the

1244
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:39,650
comforter once a month or something like
that.

1245
00:52:39,651 --> 00:52:40,610
That's the thing.
Yeah.

1246
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,060
That's where all the loads are.
That's what they found the show.

1247
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,630
It was the comforter and the headboard,
you know,

1248
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,640
especially those,
those beds that have lighter cloth 

1249
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:51,950
headboard fucking home.
It's just like,

1250
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:57,160
like,
like the back windshield and pulp 

1251
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,291
fiction bolted shut.
That loads all over that fucking 

1252
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:01,650
headboard.
Oh,

1253
00:53:01,651 --> 00:53:06,651
is that his named Kenny?
I forgot to shut Kenny in the head or 

1254
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:10,091
something like that was the really 
uncomfortable seeing where Quintin 

1255
00:53:10,091 --> 00:53:13,750
Tarantino tried to be down and said the 
word nigger to Samuel Jackson and kept 

1256
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,470
saying it.
I got a dead nigger in my house.

1257
00:53:15,471 --> 00:53:16,820
Like why do I have a dead nigger in my 
house?

1258
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,490
And it was like,
what?

1259
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:20,830
Who the fuck talks like that,
you know,

1260
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:25,740
who there was not even gangsters.
Even there's no white guys that,

1261
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,220
that

1262
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,200
talk like that too.
Black guys,

1263
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,550
why do I have a dead nigger in my house?
I mean that scene was so fake and it was

1264
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:36,540
so like him living out some weird white 
boy fantasy where he wants to be able to

1265
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:39,330
say nigger to a black guy because he 
wrote a script.

1266
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:39,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

1267
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,200
It used to be a big Quintin Tarantino 
Fan.

1268
00:53:42,201 --> 00:53:43,490
But you know,
when I see,

1269
00:53:43,491 --> 00:53:45,440
I saw that TMZ video.
You ever see that?

1270
00:53:45,441 --> 00:53:47,360
Where he attacks like the cameraman?
No,

1271
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,910
and he just came off.
That's it.

1272
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:51,600
Like a dick.
And I was.

1273
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,830
I've seen them come off really cool and 
interviews.

1274
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:58,831
I've seen him come off like a Dick,
but I think these are volatile God 

1275
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:00,520
because he's a creative guy and he's 
probably super fucking busy all the time

1276
00:54:00,521 --> 00:54:05,521
and a lot of stress.
And if you catch them at the wrong time 

1277
00:54:05,521 --> 00:54:05,530
and you're trying to talk shit to him,
be stupid.

1278
00:54:05,531 --> 00:54:09,280
He's very likely to talk shit back to 
you and come off all Douchey,

1279
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,560
but you've got to think what's the 
situation?

1280
00:54:11,561 --> 00:54:14,110
It's not him forcing his penis on 
someone.

1281
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:17,420
It's someone wanting to videotape him.
When I was wanting to be video,

1282
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:20,020
someone coming up to a member,
but I think it was just somebody,

1283
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,060
a hammer.
I wish I could find that link right now.

1284
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,630
I think it was somebody going,
hey,

1285
00:54:23,631 --> 00:54:25,130
I'm a big fan of your movies and stuff.
Got.

1286
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:26,740
And he was just like,
really?

1287
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:26,950
Yeah.

1288
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:28,930
I think it was something like that.
I remember thinking,

1289
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:33,931
wow,
that maybe just has a huge aversion to 

1290
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:33,931
all that Tmz Shit,
you know?

1291
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:35,530
Maybe that just drives them nuts.
I don't know.

1292
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:37,330
You know,
I'm a big fan of pulp fiction.

1293
00:54:37,331 --> 00:54:40,180
I love that fucking movie.
But then I read all that shit that Roger

1294
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,430
Avery said.
You Roger Avery who's in jail.

1295
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,640
He claims that there was like a movie 
that,

1296
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:50,820
that Quintin Tarantino did when he was a
star in the movie where he had this 

1297
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,360
whole scene about top gun.
Do you remember the scene?

1298
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:53,900
He had a.
um,

1299
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:59,100
it was a whole scene in this movie about
top gun being a gay story and this is 

1300
00:54:59,261 --> 00:55:00,760
why it's gay.
And like,

1301
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,820
you know,
like he,

1302
00:55:01,821 --> 00:55:06,821
he goes into this whole rant.
Well apparently that was like Roger 

1303
00:55:06,821 --> 00:55:07,380
Avery's rant.
Roger Avery.

1304
00:55:07,381 --> 00:55:09,670
Yeah.
Roger Avery wrote killing Zoe,

1305
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:12,070
which is an awesome movie if you've 
never seen it,

1306
00:55:12,071 --> 00:55:17,071
really interesting cool crime movie.
And he wrote pulp fiction with Quentin 

1307
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:22,950
Tarantino and you know,
they would collaborate on things and 

1308
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:22,950
then,
you know,

1309
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:22,950
he would tell.
He would say,

1310
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,120
tell me these stores.
I slapped him.

1311
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:30,900
Yeah.
Well maybe that guy needed to be one of 

1312
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:30,900
the audio real quick.
Okay.

1313
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,020
Let's play the audio,
play the audio and put it up to the 

1314
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:34,480
microphone.
And so Terentino's slaps a camera man.

1315
00:55:34,481 --> 00:55:36,370
This is what it's called.
Let me pause this real quick

1316
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:39,770
and okay,
let's play it.

1317
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,760
So he's walking through this parking 
lot.

1318
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,040
What's going on here?
What's going on here?

1319
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:55,350
What are you doing?
What are you doing again?

1320
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,290
Yeah,
that's good.

1321
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,550
Just keep going.

1322
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,880
Go,
go,

1323
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,120
go,
go,

1324
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,570
go,
go,

1325
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:24,580
go.
Yeah,

1326
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,560
because you're filming yet.
But if that was off,

1327
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:31,040
I'd be whooping your ass up and down 
this tree.

1328
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:31,280
Yeah.

1329
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,090
That's interesting.
And if you look at that.

1330
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,690
All right,
so if you haven't seen it,

1331
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:52,720
Quintin Tarantino slaps a camera man on 
youtube and it's some guy who gets 

1332
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,030
douchey with him.

1333
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,180
I'll put it in your chat on the stream.
But if you look at the,

1334
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:57,790
the,
the,

1335
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:00,050
the other videos like the related 
videos,

1336
00:57:00,051 --> 00:57:02,390
like Quintin Tarantino spits on some 
guy,

1337
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:07,970
the reporter he fucked with.
Maybe that guy just came up to him

1338
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:13,250
camera and he wouldn't tell them what it
was about and he just sticking a camera 

1339
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:14,070
in his face and maybe he felt like he 
was being violated and he felt like that

1340
00:57:14,071 --> 00:57:15,930
guy was a dickhead.
You know?

1341
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:16,740
I mean,
look,

1342
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,660
I could see his point,
you know,

1343
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:23,750
look when,
when someone's fucking with you like 

1344
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:23,750
that,
you know,

1345
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,220
you don't always catch you in the most 
perfect of moods.

1346
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:27,060
You know?
I mean,

1347
00:57:27,061 --> 00:57:32,061
he could easily be involved in some big 
stressful fucking thing with some movie 

1348
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:33,390
he's doing and he's in the middle of 
this shit.

1349
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,640
And then he steps outside.
Some guys got a camera in his face,

1350
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:36,450
he's like,
what are you doing man?

1351
00:57:36,451 --> 00:57:37,350
Why?
Why are you doing this?

1352
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,670
And the guy won't say anything to him or
the guy.

1353
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:41,310
I want to explain it to him and he gets 
mad.

1354
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:46,800
It's possible.
Maybe just sends the guy was a Douche 

1355
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:46,800
bag.

1356
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:46,800
We're not seeing the guy with the 
camera.

1357
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:51,860
You know,
I just posted on my twitter red band 

1358
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,760
back on or Red Band Red Ban Terentino's 
a bad motherfucker.

1359
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,260
Well,
pulp fiction was an awesome movie,

1360
00:57:55,261 --> 00:57:56,810
but I don't know.
You know the,

1361
00:57:56,811 --> 00:57:59,880
the whole Roger Avery thing is,
it's an unfortunate.

1362
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:04,910
Roger Avery says that that whole top gun
rent was like his rant and the 

1363
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:08,821
Tarantino,
he said it in front of Tarantino and 

1364
00:58:08,821 --> 00:58:10,791
Tarantino.
Tina went and put it in a movie with 

1365
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:11,430
Tara Tito.
That's what he does with his movies.

1366
00:58:11,431 --> 00:58:14,760
Like a lot of his movies are like old 
stories that he kinda like redoes right?

1367
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,080
Yeah.

1368
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:20,590
Well have you been.
We were talking about earlier about the 

1369
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:22,761
hurt locker,
how that guy suing the writer of the 

1370
00:58:22,761 --> 00:58:25,851
hurt locker,
saying that he took a article that he 

1371
00:58:25,851 --> 00:58:28,230
did for playboy,
I guess about his time in the bomb squad

1372
00:58:28,231 --> 00:58:31,320
and they re wrote it into the movie,
the hurt locker

1373
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:35,650
and it's really similar,
like the guy had like blonde hair blue.

1374
00:58:35,651 --> 00:58:37,930
I came from a trailer.
The whole deal,

1375
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,350
like his story is exactly that story,
but in their defense,

1376
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,690
like how many guys in the military or 
blond hair,

1377
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:46,060
blue eyes come from trailers.
There's probably a lot,

1378
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:51,380
you know,
totally the fact that he was actually a 

1379
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:51,380
bomb,
you know,

1380
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:54,130
specialists and detonation specialists 
in this guy was as well.

1381
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:54,640
Yeah.

1382
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,070
And,
and what's crazy,

1383
00:58:56,071 --> 00:59:01,071
even as the creator,
those movies are supposedly going to 

1384
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:04,941
sooth thousands of bit torrent users.
People that downloaded the movie 

1385
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,990
illegally on the Internet and they're 
going to go after all of these users,

1386
00:59:06,991 --> 00:59:10,140
which I thought was very metallic.
Metallic.

1387
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,820
Yeah.
Like the old napster earlage.

1388
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:14,040
Yeah.
Very Douchey,

1389
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,460
douchey.
I think it is douchey.

1390
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:17,490
Well,
if it's his movie,

1391
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:18,010
right?
Right.

1392
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,400
If he's losing money because all these 
people,

1393
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,030
he's really losing money from it.
I

1394
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,420
don't know.
I mean that's an argument,

1395
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:24,680
right?
There is an argument,

1396
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:25,680
but it's,
you know,

1397
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,730
look,
no one has a right to it for free.

1398
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,190
That's an argument as well,
right?

1399
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,210
You don't have a right to be downloading
someone's work.

1400
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:35,480
These guys worked.
They did all this time,

1401
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:37,400
put a pause time,
put all this effort,

1402
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:39,740
you know,
made a script,

1403
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:44,800
cast it,
got funding the whole deal and all you 

1404
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,150
do is just press a button on bit torrent
and white and you got it on your desktop

1405
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:49,790
and you watch it for free.
There's something fucked up about that.

1406
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,740
It's not like a band,
you know,

1407
00:59:51,741 --> 00:59:53,180
like if you go see a band,
you know,

1408
00:59:53,181 --> 00:59:57,780
like say if you download a band's mp3s 
and you got them offline wire assumption

1409
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:00,500
and then you go,
well I'm going to go support these guys.

1410
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:05,501
I'm going to see them in concert.
I'm going to buy the CD because I liked 

1411
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:09,121
it so much.
You know that I'm going to become a fan 

1412
01:00:09,121 --> 01:00:09,121
of this band because I downloaded their 
shit for free.

1413
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,590
Is that really going to help you with 
this guy with his movie?

1414
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:17,591
I mean,
when's his next movie fucking a year 

1415
01:00:17,591 --> 01:00:17,591
from now or something like that.
I mean,

1416
01:00:17,591 --> 01:00:19,070
are you really going to be excited to go
see his next work?

1417
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,660
Is it advertise him?
Is it,

1418
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,170
does he get

1419
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:24,310
deal in a shit?
Depends if he was how good this movie is

1420
01:00:24,311 --> 01:00:29,311
and how good of a directory is.
If he was Quintin Tarantino doing pulp 

1421
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,311
fiction and I downloaded that,
like,

1422
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,820
Holy Shit,
I'm buying that shit on Blu Ray,

1423
01:00:30,821 --> 01:00:33,010
I'm falling.
I'm watching every movie this guy does.

1424
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:33,640
Um,
you know what I mean?

1425
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,230
Oh,
I see that argument.

1426
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:35,680
Or

1427
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:39,330
just decide to steal his next shit.
Shit's coming out.

1428
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:42,060
Like you really do support them.
Do you do that?

1429
01:00:42,061 --> 01:00:43,770
Like if you download something and you 
like it,

1430
01:00:43,771 --> 01:00:45,630
do you support the artists?
Absolutely.

1431
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:46,320
Yeah,
I do too.

1432
01:00:46,321 --> 01:00:47,550
I think that's important,
man.

1433
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:49,680
It doesn't happen quite as often.
That is shit though.

1434
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:50,500
I don't think,
you know,

1435
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:55,510
like you do that with movies.
Like if you download a movie and you 

1436
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:55,510
really like it,
do you buy?

1437
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:55,920
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1438
01:00:55,921 --> 01:00:56,730
totally,
totally.

1439
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:01,910
Beowulf was one of them.
I download Beowulf and I liked that 

1440
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:04,640
work.
What if you have a legal copy and your 

1441
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,070
house and then you also have an illegal 
copy on your computer?

1442
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:10,220
It should cancel it out,
but I don't think that's how it works 

1443
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:10,220
it.
You're totally right.

1444
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,671
Yeah.
You should be able to have a copy as 

1445
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:13,671
long as you're not putting it up on some
sites or something like that.

1446
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:15,060
If you have your own copy.
What the fuck is wrong with?

1447
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:15,950
Yeah,
you know,

1448
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:20,951
it would be cool.
It's like if you got in trouble and I'm 

1449
01:01:20,951 --> 01:01:20,951
like,
all right,

1450
01:01:20,951 --> 01:01:20,951
you're going to go to court for 
$100,000,

1451
01:01:20,951 --> 01:01:22,250
but you have 24 hours to buy this movie 
on DVD.

1452
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:24,490
Yeah,
that would.

1453
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,410
That's how it was actually a good move,
right?

1454
01:01:26,411 --> 01:01:27,540
Move.
Yeah.

1455
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,140
Just just sue everybody,
but you have to buy it on Blue Ray in 24

1456
01:01:32,141 --> 01:01:33,580
hours.
It's a tricky argument,

1457
01:01:33,581 --> 01:01:38,581
man.
It's a tricky argument because you know 

1458
01:01:38,581 --> 01:01:38,581
what,
what?

1459
01:01:38,581 --> 01:01:40,510
What's going on in the Internet now is 
that anything can be broken down to ones

1460
01:01:40,511 --> 01:01:41,350
and Zeros.
I mean,

1461
01:01:41,351 --> 01:01:42,850
these,
these images,

1462
01:01:42,851 --> 01:01:45,310
these videos,
these song files,

1463
01:01:45,311 --> 01:01:50,311
audio files,
it's all just ones and zeros flying 

1464
01:01:50,311 --> 01:01:53,191
through the tubes and you know,
anybody can put it up there and anybody 

1465
01:01:53,191 --> 01:01:55,570
can pull it down and when you can 
convert a movie and you know,

1466
01:01:55,571 --> 01:02:00,571
you do all the time into,
into something digital that's 

1467
01:02:00,571 --> 01:02:00,571
downloadable.
It's like,

1468
01:02:00,571 --> 01:02:02,310
how the fuck do you control that?
You know,

1469
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:04,750
you have to just hope that you make 
enough movie,

1470
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:10,020
enough money when the movie's out and 
that enough people get excited about it 

1471
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,110
to buy the DVD for other extra features 
and all that shit.

1472
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,080
But then people take the dvds after 
they're released and they put those up.

1473
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:19,200
What I don't get is a friend of ours 
actually just got a letter from their 

1474
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:19,710
isp saying,
um,

1475
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,040
ABC has caught them downloading a bunch.
The Jew a that ABC has caught them for 

1476
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:32,160
downloading a bunch of shit.
And they're like,

1477
01:02:32,161 --> 01:02:34,380
this is just a warning.
Nothing's happening right now.

1478
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:39,381
But we just wanted to let you know that 
ABC sent us this letter and they know 

1479
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:39,570
about you downloading.
So chill the fuck out.

1480
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:42,810
And what was crazy is it wasn't 
anything,

1481
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,450
it was TV shows,
free tv,

1482
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:49,140
it was like lost and stuff like that.
It wasn't even a movie.

1483
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,420
So.
But was he downloading illegally?

1484
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:53,110
Yeah,
he was downloading them illegally.

1485
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:58,300
Supposed to do that because they have 
their own sites and there's pay 

1486
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:58,300
services.
I know,

1487
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,250
I just thought it was crazy that they 
got,

1488
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:03,150
they it some free instead of him getting
caught for like Avatar.

1489
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,420
And did he do this through?
I'm a bit torn on how you did it.

1490
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:06,830
Yeah.

1491
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:07,940
Wow.
They busted them.

1492
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:09,870
He's one of those guys.
Yeah.

1493
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:10,890
But you know,
he's one of those guys,

1494
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:15,891
I don't know if you do this either,
but he's one of those guys that like 

1495
01:03:15,891 --> 01:03:16,890
downloads a movie and then keeps it 
seeding for like two months.

1496
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:20,220
You know what I mean?
Because I'm one of those people like,

1497
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:26,570
oh,
that's probably what they caught them 

1498
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:26,570
doing it.
Seeding the.

1499
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:26,570
Yeah.
So that's why they call it.

1500
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:27,720
Let's see.
But uh,

1501
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,820
I am one of those guys,
like once I download the seconds,

1502
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:30,570
download,
delete,

1503
01:03:30,571 --> 01:03:31,700
torrent file,
you know,

1504
01:03:31,701 --> 01:03:36,701
and just wonder how many people do that.
Like they look at their shit and they 

1505
01:03:36,701 --> 01:03:36,701
go,
okay,

1506
01:03:36,701 --> 01:03:36,701
what,
how many,

1507
01:03:36,701 --> 01:03:37,140
you know,
we're,

1508
01:03:37,141 --> 01:03:39,990
we're all these coming from,
they're coming from this one and what is

1509
01:03:39,991 --> 01:03:41,130
this guy doing?
Oh look at this.

1510
01:03:41,131 --> 01:03:46,131
He's put up all these things that we 
have and it's coming from this one user 

1511
01:03:46,131 --> 01:03:46,250
it let's find out who this isp belonged.

1512
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,720
I think a lot of people don't even know 
how to use the torrent system.

1513
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:53,721
So like you get a lot of like young kids
or moms that are like downloading sex 

1514
01:03:53,721 --> 01:03:55,290
and the city and they just keep the 
torrent going for life.

1515
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:55,980
You know,
what do they do?

1516
01:03:55,981 --> 01:04:00,981
They,
they get your Ip from them or they find 

1517
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:00,981
out your isp or your Isp,
your Internet service provider.

1518
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:04,380
The Internet protocol is your specific 
number that every,

1519
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:06,180
everyone that gets online,
if you don't know this,

1520
01:04:06,181 --> 01:04:11,181
you have a very specific number.
It could be static or it could 

1521
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:11,640
fluctuate,
it could fluctuate.

1522
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:13,170
If you have dialogue,
like every time you do it,

1523
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:14,280
you get a different Ip,
right?

1524
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,180
Right.
So what it is,

1525
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:20,181
it's these movie places putting out 
their own torrents and seeds and 

1526
01:04:20,181 --> 01:04:22,470
collecting Ip addresses from like 
they'll put their own movies out,

1527
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:22,700
you know?

1528
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:23,460
Really?
Yeah.

1529
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:27,300
So they put their movie out on purpose 
to see if you download it.

1530
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,620
I think that's how one of their ways 
they're doing it.

1531
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,430
That's the dumbest Shit I've ever heard 
of that's like,

1532
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:37,460
that should be,
let's see what they're doing is 

1533
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:37,460
entrapment.
I think that's a lot of it though,

1534
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,180
is a lot of it is a.
If you download,

1535
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:44,181
like I downloaded an m and m cd once and
it was just like all these songs or 

1536
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:45,420
loops and I think it was,
it's like bait.

1537
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:49,590
So they put out shitty versions of it.
But that's ridiculous.

1538
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:54,090
This didn't Madonna put out one.
I wish I got ahold of that one.

1539
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:59,091
I would love to see that because Madonna
put out one where it was like her music 

1540
01:04:59,091 --> 01:05:01,290
or her new CD and she's like,
if he fucking download music,

1541
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:04,560
I'll kick your ass or something crazy 
about that.

1542
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,020
If you download music illegally,
I'll kick your ass.

1543
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:11,100
I'm speak.
That to me sounds like,

1544
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,320
you know,
just the fact that they're doing that,

1545
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:18,500
putting out bogus versions of it or 
versions of their shit where they can 

1546
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:18,760
track you from,
you know,

1547
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:23,230
it sounds ridiculous.
They're just trying to arrest people and

1548
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:25,330
scare people now.
I think that's dumb.

1549
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:28,240
They putting out versions of it to track
people.

1550
01:05:28,241 --> 01:05:33,241
Like really?
You thought it's like that's like you 

1551
01:05:33,241 --> 01:05:33,241
putting out the bait,
you're putting it out there.

1552
01:05:33,241 --> 01:05:37,850
You know,
even if people are already downloaded 

1553
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,521
it,
you're actually putting it out there 

1554
01:05:39,521 --> 01:05:39,521
hoping people will do things illegally 
with it,

1555
01:05:39,521 --> 01:05:39,820
but it,
it's out there because of you.

1556
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:43,480
That seems to me to be fucked up.
There's a funny story man,

1557
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:47,650
about these undercover cops that 
arrested other undercover cops.

1558
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:53,010
There was this whole drug deal that was 
set up between these undercover cops 

1559
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:57,061
that were posing as drug dealers and 
these other undercover cops that were 

1560
01:05:57,061 --> 01:05:57,790
posing as buyers to the drugs.

1561
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:59,560
Yeah,
and these fucking dummies.

1562
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:01,630
They,
they went to arrest each other.

1563
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,700
That's so awesome,
man.

1564
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:06,400
I want to see that there are both 
undercover.

1565
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,490
It's A.
I don't know what state it's in.

1566
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:10,850
I want to download that,
the uh,

1567
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,110
or Dell County,
I don't know where that is.

1568
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:19,510
Um,
I should find out just so everybody 

1569
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:19,510
knows.
But the story is that these guys,

1570
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:20,860
they went to their superiors and they 
said,

1571
01:06:20,861 --> 01:06:25,861
hey,
we're about to make a buck North 

1572
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:25,861
Carolina there,
there were about to make this bust.

1573
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:29,710
So they said they wanted to find out if 
they had anybody else.

1574
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:34,711
If somebody had anybody working 
undercover and they always say no to 

1575
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:38,941
that shit because they could be dirty 
cops and the dirty cops could pay off 

1576
01:06:38,941 --> 01:06:42,781
drug dealers.
The drug dealers find out that these 

1577
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:43,000
guys were undercover and they kill them.
So they always say no.

1578
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:44,420
Right.
Do you have anybody undercover?

1579
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,910
No.
So they say,

1580
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:47,340
okay,
there's an under covers.

1581
01:06:47,341 --> 01:06:47,800
We,
we've,

1582
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:48,670
you know,
approved it,

1583
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,750
let's arrest him.
So they use all these resources and they

1584
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,570
had the whole thing is them.
They're the drug dealer,

1585
01:06:55,780 --> 01:07:00,780
the drug buyer,
fake fake drug dealers and fake drug 

1586
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,280
buyers arresting itself.
We should get that money back.

1587
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:07,090
We should find out how much that costs 
to do all that that you just did.

1588
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:12,070
Roscoe Pico,
that's a ridiculous clusterfuck.

1589
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,140
That's one of the dumbest cluster flux 
of all time.

1590
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,540
Undercover cops arresting undercover 
cops.

1591
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:17,910
Wow.
Yeah,

1592
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,310
it's hilarious.
That's what's hilarious.

1593
01:07:21,311 --> 01:07:26,311
Is that a volcano?
It's like taking all those planes and 

1594
01:07:26,311 --> 01:07:26,950
grounding planes still,
right?

1595
01:07:26,951 --> 01:07:29,190
Yeah.
And what's great is Lindsay Lohan was at

1596
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:32,680
out of town and she's supposed to like 
finish all these alcohol classes by like

1597
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:37,681
tomorrow and she's just like four more 
to do and she was going to come back 

1598
01:07:37,681 --> 01:07:41,581
today and I do like four classes and one
day she got grounded because of that 

1599
01:07:41,581 --> 01:07:42,970
said Nancy's going to jail.
It's really,

1600
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,870
she's going to go to jail because she,
she had to be here for that.

1601
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:51,900
She's supposed to be here tomorrow and 
he's supposed to have had all these 

1602
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:52,240
classes done and she can't even get home
to do it.

1603
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:57,270
So they're saying there's that many 
plans are still being grounded because 

1604
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:57,270
of that volcano.
Yeah.

1605
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:57,730
Whoa.
Yeah.

1606
01:07:58,330 --> 01:07:59,290
Fucking.
By the way,

1607
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:04,350
when I was in Portland,
how crazy was it driving down the 

1608
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:04,350
highway,
seeing that Mount Rushmore.

1609
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:05,590
Rushmore.
What's the one?

1610
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,380
What's the one that blew up?
Fuji.

1611
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,860
Mount Saint Helens.
Mount Sinai crazy,

1612
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:16,190
seeing

1613
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,490
that thing in the middle,
just this huge volcanoes.

1614
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,230
It's fucking crazy.
People died from that one,

1615
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:22,100
right?
I think so.

1616
01:08:22,101 --> 01:08:27,101
And they had to.
Is that in Oregon or is that in 

1617
01:08:27,101 --> 01:08:27,101
Washington?
State of Washington state to state,

1618
01:08:27,101 --> 01:08:27,410
but it.
But you can see it.

1619
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,570
Yeah.
Well we were at,

1620
01:08:28,590 --> 01:08:31,070
we were on the corner of I guess 
Portland and Washington.

1621
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:36,071
It's like right next to each other.
So because we're going to Washington 

1622
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:36,071
over this bridge back and forth all day 
long.

1623
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:40,451
So I was watching the show on tsunamis.
We were talking about the Pacific 

1624
01:08:40,451 --> 01:08:41,780
northwest and how many times over the 
last thousand years it's been jacked,

1625
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:43,220
you know,
but civilization,

1626
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,960
they're so recent.
We don't even realize it.

1627
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:48,170
Civilization on the Pacific northwest of
the United States has only been the last

1628
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:49,550
300 years,
you know,

1629
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:52,610
so unless you know what I mean.
Before that there was Indians of course,

1630
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:54,260
but I'm talking like big buildings and 
shit.

1631
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:58,160
So like the cycle of them getting hit by
giant tsunamis.

1632
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:00,320
I mean it happens every thousand years 
or so.

1633
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:05,530
The whole side of the country gets hit 
with some fucking 1000 foot high wave 

1634
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:06,660
and everything gets crushed.
Wow.

1635
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,830
I guess it gets what with Tyler durden 
do.com

1636
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:13,310
and looked up flights and there's tons 
of fights still going on.

1637
01:09:13,311 --> 01:09:16,820
So she was lying so she's just.
She's fucked even more.

1638
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:17,870
Oh,
that dirty bitch.

1639
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,930
She's probably don't cook.
Didn't want to fly.

1640
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,320
Get his lying sources.
Say she can.

1641
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:29,410
She can't get a flight back to the 
states because of the volcanic ash from 

1642
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:32,231
Iceland.
Airports all over Europe are jam packed 

1643
01:09:32,231 --> 01:09:32,231
and it's impossible to get a seat is 
what she's saying.

1644
01:09:32,231 --> 01:09:36,611
But delta has five nonstop flight from 
Paris to New York City and like I guess 

1645
01:09:36,741 --> 01:09:38,540
they just went through and found all 
these flights.

1646
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:42,950
So flights not only there are flights 
but they're not booked I guess.

1647
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:46,640
So that's what tyler durden do.
What would tyler durden do?

1648
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:49,990
He says that the whole thing is very 
funny that people even give a shit fall.

1649
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
This poor young kid.
It's all fucked up on drugs and 

1650
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,610
everybody thinks it's a funny deal,
you know?

1651
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,720
Do you know what you would be like if 
you were hot and you were Lindsay Lohan?

1652
01:09:58,721 --> 01:10:00,320
You were 23 years old and you're a 
multi,

1653
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:03,260
multi fucking millionaire.
Just out there doing drugs,

1654
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:05,100
getting stuffed every night.
You know,

1655
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:09,110
he'd be fucking crazy to who the fuck 
would not be crazy.

1656
01:10:09,111 --> 01:10:11,960
I want to know what person could keep it
together as Lindsay Lohan,

1657
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:12,980
who,
who could,

1658
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:15,920
who could live that girl's life 23 
fucking years old.

1659
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:20,921
Looks like she's 40,
been doing drugs and she was a little 

1660
01:10:20,921 --> 01:10:20,921
kid.
I mean who?

1661
01:10:20,921 --> 01:10:21,440
The,
who could keep it together,

1662
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:24,980
you know,
became famous as a child.

1663
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:30,400
She went from basically from like junior
high school to fucking superstardom 

1664
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:35,350
multimillions of dollars.
Totally unrealistic life in the toe the 

1665
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:35,720
whole time we were supposed to be 
developing.

1666
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:41,200
You're supposed to be growing as a human
being and figuring yourself out and 

1667
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,010
being insecure and establishing yourself
in the world while the whole time that's

1668
01:10:43,011 --> 01:10:48,011
all supposed to be happening.
She's getting millions and millions of 

1669
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:51,070
dollars for being famous and for 
pretending you know who the fuck could 

1670
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:53,240
do that and do it right?
Um,

1671
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:56,800
the Jonas brothers,
Miley Cyrus and yeah,

1672
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:59,030
those are,
those are ticking time bombs,

1673
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:01,310
my friend.
Those are guarantees.

1674
01:11:01,311 --> 01:11:03,260
Those are social guarantees.
No,

1675
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:04,820
no doubt.
They're going to be fucked up.

1676
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:09,940
Corey Haim and Corey Feldman.
Neither one of them could stop from 

1677
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:13,781
being fucked up even together.
They weren't strong enough brand 

1678
01:11:13,781 --> 01:11:13,781
together.
Do you know?

1679
01:11:13,781 --> 01:11:14,010
He even lived by me.

1680
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,200
I didn't know that when he died he.
Him.

1681
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:15,720
Yeah,
he,

1682
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:20,750
that when all the people were like 
mourning him outside of this apartment 

1683
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:20,750
down the street from me.
And I'm like,

1684
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:21,970
Oh shit.
He lived there the whole time.

1685
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:24,120
Yeah.
That dude had it.

1686
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:27,950
Bad drugs are a motherfucker.
People thought I looked like him growing

1687
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:28,800
up.
Really?

1688
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:30,360
I don't see it.
No.

1689
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:31,530
Nope.
Don't say it.

1690
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,410
Do you see it?
I did back in the day.

1691
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:38,430
So back to this,
this fucking Miss America.

1692
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:43,520
Because what I want to talk about is how
many people were upset that this Miss 

1693
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,390
America chick is a.
she's Armenian.

1694
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,950
I guess something like that.
Lebanese.

1695
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,830
Sorry.
Armenians would be pissed right now.

1696
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,720
Carl Breezy and was right here,
Bro.

1697
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,550
Bro.
You can't fucking say Lebanese Armenian,

1698
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,490
Bro,
Bro,

1699
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,170
but uh,
this,

1700
01:12:01,171 --> 01:12:06,171
this chick,
the most important thing is that she's 

1701
01:12:06,171 --> 01:12:06,171
American and she's hot as fuck.

1702
01:12:06,171 --> 01:12:07,190
Like,
that's the dumbest thing ever.

1703
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:07,910
Like you,
you,

1704
01:12:07,911 --> 01:12:10,110
you,
you can't be from another country.

1705
01:12:10,111 --> 01:12:10,620
You,
you know,

1706
01:12:10,621 --> 01:12:15,621
your family can't be from an Arab 
country and you can't be considered an 

1707
01:12:15,621 --> 01:12:19,370
American just because we have issues 
with Arabs and other parts of the world.

1708
01:12:19,371 --> 01:12:19,980
Like,
guess what?

1709
01:12:19,981 --> 01:12:22,250
Fuck it.
Those aren't the same people like w,

1710
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:22,700
W,
W,

1711
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:26,090
how dumb are people that becomes an 
issue and that these,

1712
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:31,130
these are people that are actually 
debating whether or not she got this 

1713
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:33,720
job.
She became Miss Usa because of political

1714
01:12:33,721 --> 01:12:36,510
correctness and the open border Nazis 
like,

1715
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:38,130
look at some of this shit that these 
people have said.

1716
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,770
Like this shell,
this chick right wing pundit.

1717
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:44,040
What?
Right wing pundit and Fox contributor,

1718
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:49,220
Michelle Malkin ranted that the girl's 
name is fucky Fucky,

1719
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:51,900
f a,
k,

1720
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:57,200
h.
I don't know how to say any of fuckees 

1721
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,930
cheerleaders are too busy touting the 
identity politics horn to care what 

1722
01:13:01,471 --> 01:13:06,471
comes out of her mouth and that the Miss
USA pageant didn't want to risk the 

1723
01:13:06,471 --> 01:13:08,430
wrath of the open borders mob.

1724
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:14,020
What the fuck are you?
You're saying that one of the other 

1725
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:15,030
checks should've won the who?
I'd most like to fuck contest.

1726
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:20,240
And you're upset that this chick one,
because of the reason why she won is 

1727
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,140
because everybody's super sensitive and 
wants to support Arabs.

1728
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:27,590
Like really?
Like how dumb is it that even Miss Usa 

1729
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:29,760
becomes like a topic of debate with 
these fuckheads shit.

1730
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:32,090
I got political correction,
topic of hair.

1731
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,870
She's fucking high.
She can be a terrorist.

1732
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,490
She's hot as fuck.
And she,

1733
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,920
she grew up going to Catholic school 
man.

1734
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:43,300
I mean the whole thing is so fucking 
poorly researched and you,

1735
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,410
you're not even making any sense.
So you're saying that anybody,

1736
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:49,290
even someone who grows up and goes to 
Catholic school,

1737
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:54,530
they can't be on the team because 
somewhere in their past there's someone 

1738
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:01,040
who lives in some other part of the 
world and those people are still there 

1739
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,010
and it really.
Is that,

1740
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:07,460
what is that how we're rolling in 2010.
I mean America is a gigantic group of 

1741
01:14:08,641 --> 01:14:11,040
immigrants and this chick and her 
family,

1742
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,250
wherever they lived

1743
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,960
sucked.
And that's why they came here.

1744
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:19,320
And the fact that they would actually 
argue that she doesn't deserve the 

1745
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,861
window.
Who I'd most like to fuck contest 

1746
01:14:22,861 --> 01:14:22,861
because of that.
I mean if she was fat,

1747
01:14:22,861 --> 01:14:24,090
disgusting,
you know,

1748
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,870
she was like some Susan Boyle can 
chicken.

1749
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:28,390
It was totally ridiculous.
Then I could see the argument,

1750
01:14:28,391 --> 01:14:33,391
but how the,
how the fuck could you argue that that 

1751
01:14:33,391 --> 01:14:33,391
check's not hot.
You can't.

1752
01:14:33,391 --> 01:14:34,180
What else do you have to do to win Miss 
USA?

1753
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:34,930
What is,
what are the,

1754
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,900
what is the.
Do you have to dance?

1755
01:14:37,901 --> 01:14:38,830
Do you have to talk?

1756
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:43,890
Yeah,
I think you have like a bathing suit 

1757
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:43,890
contest.
I think you have to do like some kind of

1758
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:44,140
like.
We definitely have to talk.

1759
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:48,100
That's how Perez Hilton busted that 
Kerry [inaudible] check sheet.

1760
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:49,750
He asked her about gay marriage.
Right?

1761
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,770
So you have to talk.
I think you're only allowed to have like

1762
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:56,820
small nipples.
You can't have that big aerial as a 

1763
01:14:56,820 --> 01:15:00,170
like.
You have to have like a certain breed 

1764
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:00,170
look.
Kind of like a dog.

1765
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:00,490
This other chick,
Gretchen Carlson,

1766
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,280
bunch of hate and bitches,
bunch of hate and bitches

1767
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:08,290
and all on Fox News.
Fox News is awesome because they're 

1768
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:09,920
awesome.
They're awesome and they're stupidity.

1769
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:11,370
We already talked about why.
How is,

1770
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:13,750
how is it?
It's hard news.

1771
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:15,850
How is it that they're allowed to call 
it news,

1772
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:18,170
but how is it that they're so like,
like that,

1773
01:15:18,171 --> 01:15:22,400
but yet they have some of the most edgy 
cartoons and TV shows on their shows,

1774
01:15:22,401 --> 01:15:27,401
you know,
like simpsons and family guy and get 

1775
01:15:27,401 --> 01:15:27,401
their news is so like,
you know,

1776
01:15:27,401 --> 01:15:28,400
right wing Rupert Murdoch doc

1777
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:29,920
is super,
super,

1778
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:32,950
super fucking rich and when you get that
rich,

1779
01:15:32,951 --> 01:15:35,890
there's only one way to be that rich.
The way to be that rich is,

1780
01:15:35,891 --> 01:15:38,140
you know,
you've got to be a ruthless motherfucker

1781
01:15:38,141 --> 01:15:41,830
businessman and that's what he is.
He's a ruthless motherfucker businessman

1782
01:15:41,831 --> 01:15:44,520
and when you're like that and super 
shrewd and ruthless,

1783
01:15:44,521 --> 01:15:46,780
you want conservative politics,
you want people that are protecting your

1784
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:51,781
money.
You want to be able to do things that 

1785
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:54,901
are going to earn you money.
You don't want to have to hear about 

1786
01:15:54,901 --> 01:15:54,950
liberals and windingness and fucking 
environmental freaks and all,

1787
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,960
even assholes.
They're going to stop you from making a 

1788
01:15:59,960 --> 01:15:59,960
good return this quarter.
You know,

1789
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,891
and that's what it is when you get to be
that super rich and very few guys like 

1790
01:16:04,891 --> 01:16:05,260
Ted Turner that are,
that rich,

1791
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:06,400
you know,
ted Turner's like this,

1792
01:16:06,401 --> 01:16:08,490
you know,
humanitarian and you know,

1793
01:16:08,491 --> 01:16:10,550
it's always like giving the charities 
and you know,

1794
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:13,730
very liberal in his network is thought 
of as like a liberal network.

1795
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:17,820
CNN is like the only.
I mean that's the one that I guess Msnbc

1796
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:19,330
is pretty liberal too,
right?

1797
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:23,420
But you know,
you don't watch any of those new shows.

1798
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:26,200
Cartoon network and that's it.
I like Fox News sometimes.

1799
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:31,201
Man.
I like it just to know that there's 

1800
01:16:31,201 --> 01:16:32,971
people out there like that.
When I hear bill o'reilly and his 

1801
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:32,971
fucking dumb smugness,
I'm like,

1802
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:37,891
there's really a guy out there like that
that is that satisfied with himself and 

1803
01:16:37,891 --> 01:16:38,980
he says,
fucking Dildo that got busted.

1804
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:42,460
Leaving a message on his assistance 
machine about how hot she is.

1805
01:16:42,461 --> 01:16:45,550
He's a total hypocrite.
He's a fucking creep and,

1806
01:16:45,551 --> 01:16:47,790
you know,
and yet he's somehow or another,

1807
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,000
he's found this,
this,

1808
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,960
this niche on tv where people enjoy 
watching them.

1809
01:16:52,961 --> 01:16:54,710
This niche.
Does that mean and,

1810
01:16:55,220 --> 01:17:00,220
and these people enjoy watching this 
fucking buffoon rant and rave and yell 

1811
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:02,590
at people who go on a show and have 
dissenting opinions,

1812
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:07,920
you know?
Did you ever see that one where he went 

1813
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:07,920
on about,
uh,

1814
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:07,920
some kid whose parents died in nine 
slash 11.

1815
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:12,511
And he was saying that it was,
the kid was saying that this is Bush's 

1816
01:17:12,511 --> 01:17:12,511
fault

1817
01:17:12,511 --> 01:17:15,460
and the reason why they're attacking us.
And he just fucking went off on the kid 

1818
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,280
and it was just,
the whole thing was just so dumb.

1819
01:17:16,281 --> 01:17:17,810
He was,
he kicked him out of there.

1820
01:17:17,811 --> 01:17:19,160
And it's like the whole,
the whole,

1821
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:24,190
the way he has conversations,
he just fucking infant tile and you got 

1822
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:26,780
to wonder whether or not it's like,
is he doing an act or is he that much of

1823
01:17:26,781 --> 01:17:29,300
a Douche bag?
Is it a combination of both?

1824
01:17:29,301 --> 01:17:32,510
And why the fuck is it so entertaining,
you know,

1825
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:35,000
like listening to Christian radio when 
you're driving,

1826
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:35,420
you know,
it's,

1827
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:38,630
it's,
it's sued a lot of people like that Bill

1828
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:43,630
O'reilly Guy.
I think this because there's a lot of 

1829
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:43,790
Douche bags out there and douchebags 
want to hear from other Douche bags,

1830
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:45,310
you know,
when you,

1831
01:17:45,311 --> 01:17:50,311
you know,
like one of the things he had Richard 

1832
01:17:50,311 --> 01:17:52,210
Dawkins on who's this renowned 
intellectual and atheist and he wrote 

1833
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:56,890
the God delusion and a couple of other 
books about religion and he thinks that 

1834
01:17:56,961 --> 01:17:57,710
religion is bad.

1835
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:02,710
And so he was saying to Richard Dawkins,
now you can't prove that God doesn't 

1836
01:18:03,351 --> 01:18:06,380
exist.
So I'm throwing in with God.

1837
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:09,080
Like he literally said it like that.
Like,

1838
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,510
you know,
if,

1839
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:15,580
if,
if it's true and there is a god I'm 

1840
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:15,920
throwing in with God,
you can't prove that there is no god,

1841
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,250
which is like how you can't prove.
There's no cheshire cat.

1842
01:18:19,251 --> 01:18:21,560
You can't prove there's nothing,
there's nothing that you can't,

1843
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:24,230
you can't prove anything.
You can never not prove.

1844
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:25,220
You know,
especially when you,

1845
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,190
when it comes to things like,
people like science has never disproven,

1846
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:30,080
you know,
the existence of Christ.

1847
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:33,140
Well,
you can't disprove someone's existence.

1848
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:34,940
It's impossible.
Like,

1849
01:18:34,941 --> 01:18:37,220
how the fuck do you know who,
who existed and who didn't.

1850
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:40,620
You know,
science isn't there to disprove sciences

1851
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:45,640
there to show me some evidence.
If science finds evidence and they 

1852
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:45,640
examine the evidence,
that's what it's all about.

1853
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,290
When there is no evidence and there's no
way to determine one way or another,

1854
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:50,310
you can't disprove,
you know,

1855
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,260
you could take something like the shroud
of Turin and you know,

1856
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:53,900
they say,
oh,

1857
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:56,600
this is Jesus's burial cloth.
It's sacred.

1858
01:18:56,601 --> 01:18:57,980
And then you could do well,
okay,

1859
01:18:57,981 --> 01:19:00,560
let's take a little bit of this cloth 
and find out how old it is.

1860
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:03,050
Oh look,
it's only 500 years old.

1861
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,580
How could it be?
Jesus was cloth.

1862
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:08,780
You disprove it that way,
but he's fucking dummy.

1863
01:19:08,781 --> 01:19:12,680
So this guy has a huge presence on that 
network and he's got.

1864
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:16,520
He's got the number one show on cable 
and it comes to those kind of stupid new

1865
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:19,490
shows.
It's a huge show and it's retarded.

1866
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,700
It's so bad.
Don't watch it.

1867
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:24,920
Is Nancy Grace on that?
She on CNN or is she?

1868
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,450
She's on CNN,
right?

1869
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,530
She's brutal.
You know you fucked up.

1870
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:33,140
If Nancy grace was talking about you,
if Nancy grace was talking about you,

1871
01:19:33,141 --> 01:19:38,141
there's a dead baby or you know you 
drowned your wife or something.

1872
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,370
Right?
It's something serious.

1873
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:45,730
There's some serious shit and she will 
hawk on the same subjects for weeks 

1874
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:47,630
waiting for the next disaster to pop up 
the news so she could switch gears.

1875
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:50,180
She talked about tiger woods for two 
weeks.

1876
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,060
Can you imagine being poor fucking tiger
woods,

1877
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:58,240
just trying to tune into some CNN,
find out what's going on in the world 

1878
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:01,810
and you've got that hatchet face,
old con just talking shit about you for 

1879
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,770
two weeks.
Like he would've figured,

1880
01:20:03,771 --> 01:20:05,000
well,
she talked about me yesterday.

1881
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:07,260
She's done.
No chance dude.

1882
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:07,950
She's not

1883
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,660
done.
She's not done for weeks.

1884
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:11,910
He's going to keep going.
Tiger.

1885
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:14,340
She the blonde haired girl.
Sang girl.

1886
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:16,200
Shannon girl.
She's a woman.

1887
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,480
Blonde hair whole.
She's a woman.

1888
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:20,160
She's an older woman.
I don't know what I mean.

1889
01:20:20,161 --> 01:20:21,270
Not,
not that much older,

1890
01:20:21,271 --> 01:20:23,130
but she's older.
She's not.

1891
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:25,050
That's one thing that Fox News does 
well.

1892
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:28,380
They put on a bunch of hot chicks.
There are some hot bitches.

1893
01:20:28,381 --> 01:20:30,180
Hot angry,
mean bitches.

1894
01:20:30,181 --> 01:20:31,800
Fox local news.
No,

1895
01:20:31,801 --> 01:20:34,080
I'm talking about Fox News period.
All Fox News.

1896
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,610
Like local news.
They're straight up.

1897
01:20:35,611 --> 01:20:38,340
Hookers really talk to me.
Telling me what's going on.

1898
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:43,560
I have collected a bunch of clips about 
the local Fox news channel and not only 

1899
01:20:43,921 --> 01:20:47,040
does the weatherman dance,
like every time he's given the weather,

1900
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:49,620
he does like a straight up dance.
Like he's dancing.

1901
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:51,270
Yeah,
it's pretty hilarious.

1902
01:20:51,271 --> 01:20:53,010
I guess they're on my facebook.
I can.

1903
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:53,290
Yeah.

1904
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:56,370
You've sent when you put one of those on
the message on the message board.

1905
01:20:56,371 --> 01:20:59,400
And it's funny because I have danced 
when every time he does the weather,

1906
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:01,900
right?
And then like that,

1907
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,540
uh,
why not,

1908
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:05,670
right?
Why not let them fucking dance?

1909
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:10,700
But it's so funny how bad it is.
Like there was the other day something 

1910
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:10,700
like,
Eh,

1911
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:11,460
it's going to be wet outside there.
You know a lot about wet,

1912
01:21:11,461 --> 01:21:12,150
don't you,
Tina?

1913
01:21:12,151 --> 01:21:12,930
And she's like,
oh,

1914
01:21:12,931 --> 01:21:15,880
that's disgusting.
And like to go there,

1915
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,570
it was just like,
are you really serious?

1916
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:23,571
Have you seen that video clip where the 
a black guy is sitting with these three 

1917
01:21:23,571 --> 01:21:25,950
white chicks and they're talking about 
some new graft and Berg spot shot.

1918
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:29,400
It's like a shot of Collagen.
They shoot inside a chick's pussy.

1919
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:34,760
They live with a needle.
They jab her fucking snatch and stuff 

1920
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:34,760
this liquid up there.

1921
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,620
And apparently it makes sex feel better.
It like in it,

1922
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,440
in it makes the,
enhances that g spot.

1923
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:41,790
Wow.
And so they do this,

1924
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:45,480
this whole thing and I'm,
the black guy goes,

1925
01:21:45,481 --> 01:21:47,940
well,
so I guess she's enjoying penis now.

1926
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:51,750
More like he said that and all three 
chicks were like,

1927
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:54,030
oh yeah,
okay.

1928
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,970
Yes.
She's enjoying sexual relations again,

1929
01:21:56,971 --> 01:21:58,290
like you know,
she tried to somehow under that,

1930
01:21:58,291 --> 01:22:00,060
cleaned it up.
Even though he used,

1931
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:05,300
he used the right terminology.
I mean he used the medical terminology 

1932
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,180
and he didn't say anything really 
inappropriate.

1933
01:22:06,181 --> 01:22:07,650
I mean that's what sexual intercourse 
is,

1934
01:22:07,651 --> 01:22:08,910
right?
And she's enjoying his penis,

1935
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,370
but somehow the fact that he mentioned 
it,

1936
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:16,400
it was like he said,
fucking candyman three times or 

1937
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:16,400
something,
you know.

1938
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,880
So in shooting joe his penis and he was 
black too.

1939
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:23,030
And so there's this black dude would 
probably a half a heart on three white 

1940
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:23,760
chicks talking about their spot getting 
pumped up.

1941
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:25,980
I bet he fucks him.
Anyway,

1942
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:31,010
that's probably what's going on.
It's probably trying to keep it 

1943
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:31,010
together,
but really fucks all three of them.

1944
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:34,730
Ladies,
let's talk about what happened on the 

1945
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:34,730
air today.
I want you to meet in my locker room.

1946
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:36,450
Go in.
His dresser just got candles,

1947
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:38,970
lit and Shit and pulls out that big 
black fucking snake.

1948
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:42,600
They all just go ask them mouth with 
them.

1949
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:47,810
I don't like when you talk about cock 
and you're staring at me if you weren't 

1950
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:54,570
looking away comfortably,
I'm watching it on the web camera like,

1951
01:22:54,571 --> 01:22:56,740
oh my God,
he's to really close to me.

1952
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:04,100
That is that not the worst thing that 
could ever happen when chick breaks up 

1953
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:04,710
with you.
So it's getting drilled by a black guy.

1954
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,360
There could be a lot of good scenarios,
you know,

1955
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:10,240
use for a lot of dudes,
man dead,

1956
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:15,010
black male equals just sexual prowess 
that you will not reach,

1957
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:15,990
you know,
they,

1958
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:21,010
they equal big black Dick and 
athleticism and just just gorilla 

1959
01:23:23,021 --> 01:23:27,100
fucking your woman just doing it right.
Doing things to her that you can't do.

1960
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:30,340
She's Kinda like it just got to love it.
It's going to get addicted to that.

1961
01:23:30,341 --> 01:23:35,341
Just getting stuffed.
Just you're just going to stick your 

1962
01:23:35,341 --> 01:23:36,400
little fucking three quarter hard,
sad,

1963
01:23:36,401 --> 01:23:39,410
a little depressed boner in there and 
thinking about getting,

1964
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:42,740
going to therapy and maybe I should take
antidepressants.

1965
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:44,650
Maybe I just need to start yoga and 
jogging.

1966
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:50,010
He's not thinking about that.
He's got a big giant black hard monster 

1967
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:50,330
Dick.
And they just.

1968
01:23:50,331 --> 01:23:52,720
And she's so fucking wet,
she can't believe how well she is.

1969
01:23:52,721 --> 01:23:56,050
She's just,
she's leaving a big puddle under her DNA

1970
01:23:56,051 --> 01:24:00,350
is crying for that big giant Dick and 
he's fucking the shit out of him.

1971
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,040
And he,
he doesn't,

1972
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:05,470
he ignores her and doesn't call her.
And so she gets sad and so she calls you

1973
01:24:05,471 --> 01:24:07,900
up and I'm sorry,
what happened?

1974
01:24:07,901 --> 01:24:10,540
It was a lot of it was my fault and you 
know,

1975
01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:12,700
I just,
we don't have to look.

1976
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:15,610
I know it can ever be together again,
but can we just talk?

1977
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,650
Can we just get together and talk?
And you're like,

1978
01:24:17,651 --> 01:24:18,550
hey,
what's the harm?

1979
01:24:18,551 --> 01:24:21,670
I ain't got shit to do tonight.
And you go over house and next thing you

1980
01:24:21,671 --> 01:24:26,671
know you're on the couch together.
You start making out and she grabbed 

1981
01:24:26,671 --> 01:24:29,350
your Dick and she starts kissing you and
she squeezes your deck a little bit.

1982
01:24:29,351 --> 01:24:31,120
Like she's looking for more.
Where's that?

1983
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:36,400
Where's the ass?
And she stops and then she goes,

1984
01:24:36,401 --> 01:24:40,480
we shouldn't do this because we 
shouldn't do this.

1985
01:24:41,190 --> 01:24:46,190
And then you look over on a nightstand,
there's just fucking hulking black guy 

1986
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:49,891
and a picture frame that God has been 
delivering the Dick to her for the past 

1987
01:24:49,891 --> 01:24:51,040
few weeks.
And you just go,

1988
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:51,670
who?
Who's that?

1989
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:58,360
It's nothing.
Can't they take nothing fixed that now 

1990
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,270
technology to fix that.
Like a gas pump they haven't fixed.

1991
01:24:59,271 --> 01:25:02,810
That can take like an ankle out of your 
foot or grow your Dick.

1992
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:04,400
Yeah.
They cannot fix dicks.

1993
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:07,010
They can't extend it.
They can take something out of your butt

1994
01:25:07,011 --> 01:25:12,011
and put it in there.
And so they can make a fake dick if 

1995
01:25:12,011 --> 01:25:12,011
you're a chick.

1996
01:25:12,011 --> 01:25:15,830
Apparently chastity Bono who used to be 
shit and when she is still shares 

1997
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:20,361
daughter,
but now she's a boy because she went 

1998
01:25:20,361 --> 01:25:23,961
through a sexual reassignment and they 
give her a bunch of hormones and they 

1999
01:25:23,961 --> 01:25:27,730
make her a dick.
But I don't think it's.

2000
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,020
It feels the same.
I don't think it shoots loads.

2001
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:36,260
That's grossest.
When they take the Deq and make it a 

2002
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:36,260
pussy where they split it out like an 
apple.

2003
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:40,050
I've seen that or what's that?
China really have a man.

2004
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:43,940
Wow.
How fucked up is your wiring that you.

2005
01:25:43,941 --> 01:25:47,060
You don't even like your part.
You want to switch to a girl part,

2006
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,470
you're embarrassed,
you really wish you were a woman.

2007
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:54,210
Do you think that they really are women 
trapped in men's or did you do.

2008
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:59,300
I do believe that,
but what about the possibility that 

2009
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,491
throughout their life they've just 
experienced so much sorrow and so much 

2010
01:26:01,491 --> 01:26:04,280
stress and so many fucked situations

2011
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:09,370
and so much trauma in their life and on 
top of that they're probably gay and 

2012
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:12,260
they're probably,
you know,

2013
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,070
more at the very least bisexual,
you know their orientation naturally.

2014
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:21,190
So it's like this natural sexual 
orientation that leans towards 

2015
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:25,211
homosexuality and massive depression and
craziness and they just decided that 

2016
01:26:25,211 --> 01:26:26,930
they want to be a girl.
That's possible too,

2017
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:27,250
right?
Yeah.

2018
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:31,330
Too much.
I have Nami at a mom makes you A.

2019
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,740
I think there's an either or.
I think.

2020
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:38,060
I don't think it's either or rather.
I don't think there's any one scenario,

2021
01:26:38,061 --> 01:26:39,740
but I think with some people they 
become.

2022
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:45,060
It's a man who becomes a woman just 
because they're fucked up and whether 

2023
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:45,060
they're getting late either and there's 
full.

2024
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:49,661
I'll just get dixon me trick people and 
then from others I think others are 

2025
01:26:49,791 --> 01:26:50,270
just,
you know,

2026
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:51,860
that's just,
I mean,

2027
01:26:51,861 --> 01:26:56,861
look,
there's a broad spectrum of human 

2028
01:26:56,861 --> 01:26:56,861
behavior.

2029
01:26:56,861 --> 01:26:56,861
It's very,
very,

2030
01:26:56,861 --> 01:26:56,861
very,
very,

2031
01:26:56,861 --> 01:27:01,301
very likely to me that somehow or 
another just someone gets a wacky gene 

2032
01:27:01,301 --> 01:27:01,301
and they just,
shit,

2033
01:27:01,301 --> 01:27:02,600
why don't I have a vagina?
You know,

2034
01:27:02,601 --> 01:27:04,000
what the fuck?
They just,

2035
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:09,030
they have this feeling like they're 
missing something because they have a 

2036
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:09,680
penis,
but that's a goddamn commitment.

2037
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:13,250
That is a God damn.
I don't remember what the movie was,

2038
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:18,251
but there was some movie where there's 
this guy in a tranny were yelling at 

2039
01:27:18,251 --> 01:27:18,830
each other,
you know,

2040
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:20,390
and,
and you know,

2041
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:25,480
and she's like in the train,
he was yelling at the guy and the guy 

2042
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:25,480
goes,
you don't even have an addict anymore.

2043
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,080
You're so fucking stupid.
You chopped off your Dick.

2044
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,420
Just like,
I didn't chop up my dick.

2045
01:27:29,421 --> 01:27:31,730
I fucking turned into a pussy.
And the guy's like,

2046
01:27:31,731 --> 01:27:33,830
that's not a pussy.
That's a dick.

2047
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:35,270
That's addicted.
It's been cut in half.

2048
01:27:35,271 --> 01:27:37,130
What movie was that?
I don't remember.

2049
01:27:37,131 --> 01:27:42,131
But there were paraphrasing obviously 
because I don't remember where it came 

2050
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:42,131
from,
but some movie or something,

2051
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:43,940
but God damn,
that's got a burn.

2052
01:27:43,941 --> 01:27:45,370
Those words,
you don't even have a date.

2053
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:46,400
You chopped your Dick off.

2054
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,820
There was a guy who was a ladyboy in 
Thailand and was kicking a lot of ass.

2055
01:27:52,821 --> 01:27:57,821
It was a Thai boxer and he would go out 
a lot of lady boys and Thailand 

2056
01:27:57,821 --> 01:28:01,541
apparently.
And this guy was a Thai box or go out 

2057
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:01,541
there and fuck dudes up,
you know.

2058
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:03,080
And it was a lady boy,
we were fucking dresses and shit,

2059
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,900
but it was a dude.
So we'd get in there and throw down,

2060
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:08,300
fuck guys up.
He was a bad ass Muay Thai fighter.

2061
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:13,570
But then he went to the operation and he
got his balls removed and when he got 

2062
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:14,330
his bowels removed,
that's a wrap son.

2063
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:16,820
No more testosterone.
A baby.

2064
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:17,190
The,
the,

2065
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:21,260
the flow stops completely.
And he shriveled up and got a woman like

2066
01:28:21,261 --> 01:28:23,970
and started getting fucked up and had a.
yeah.

2067
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:29,220
I don't know how many fights you had as 
a woman at an actual woman after they 

2068
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:29,840
took his balls off,
once they took his balls off,

2069
01:28:29,841 --> 01:28:32,120
he was useless.
They beat the shit out of that full.

2070
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:40,270
Well,
that's what makes you a man with cancer 

2071
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:43,811
and stuff like that.
You automatically start getting more 

2072
01:28:43,811 --> 01:28:44,450
woman like a wonder.
That's a good question.

2073
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,260
Um,
you know,

2074
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:46,850
I think with,
with some guys,

2075
01:28:46,851 --> 01:28:51,851
they,
they wind up supplementing the 

2076
01:28:51,851 --> 01:28:51,851
testosterone because their balls don't 
work.

2077
01:28:51,851 --> 01:28:56,260
You know,
I've heard of bodybuilders having to do 

2078
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,331
that.
Like bodybuilders get to a point where 

2079
01:28:58,331 --> 01:29:00,101
they,
they shoot so much testing to their by 

2080
01:29:00,101 --> 01:29:00,830
their bowels just shut down for life.
Their balls won't come back.

2081
01:29:00,831 --> 01:29:02,290
Right.
So they have to like

2082
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:06,030
give themselves testosterone shots.
I was watching that China porn the other

2083
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:11,031
day.
I was looking for a video and it just 

2084
01:29:11,031 --> 01:29:11,031
happened to come up and I was like,
oh,

2085
01:29:11,031 --> 01:29:11,700
I forgot about the video that you do 
that.

2086
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,220
But that's like the Mexican drug dealer 
getting his head cut off.

2087
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:16,310
Did you see that?
Same thing to me.

2088
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:20,370
She has a huge Dick Dick.
It's a dick.

2089
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:20,940
Yeah.
Well,

2090
01:29:20,941 --> 01:29:22,710
that's what I was saying,
what they can,

2091
01:29:22,711 --> 01:29:25,590
they can grow you a dick and when they 
give you testosterone,

2092
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,220
your clit grows to the size of a thumb.
It grows big.

2093
01:29:29,221 --> 01:29:31,560
Like how big would you say her?
Her dic is to treat long.

2094
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:32,340
Yeah.
It was pretty bad.

2095
01:29:32,341 --> 01:29:34,320
It was like a thumb,
like two inches long.

2096
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:35,400
Right?
It appears to have.

2097
01:29:35,401 --> 01:29:37,100
I remember it.
No,

2098
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,220
she didn't really.
She did have.

2099
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:43,310
I remember dude,
she was on fear factor and she completed

2100
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:48,311
this,
this stunt and after she completed this 

2101
01:29:48,311 --> 01:29:48,311
done,
she flexed and she goes,

2102
01:29:48,311 --> 01:29:49,880
who's the man?

2103
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:54,010
No way she did in town right there.
Yeah.

2104
01:29:54,011 --> 01:29:55,020
She said,
who's the man?

2105
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,880
What pitch are you crazy?
How crazy are you?

2106
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:02,730
Would you.
Would you have sex with her if I had to?

2107
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:03,660
Yeah.
Yeah,

2108
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:08,490
if I lived in Michigan or some shit 
standards lower though.

2109
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:10,710
You lived at Ohio,
you had lower standards,

2110
01:30:10,711 --> 01:30:12,270
right?
It happens.

2111
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:15,200
Lived in Portland.
Your standards would drop.

2112
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,520
Know Dude,
Portland be impossible.

2113
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:22,550
Really?
If you want to talk a trick with hairy 

2114
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:22,550
legs,
sure,

2115
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:25,501
I'd shave him,
but that was even gave them first 40 

2116
01:30:25,501 --> 01:30:25,501
fucking.
That was even the problem though.

2117
01:30:25,501 --> 01:30:26,970
There wasn't even like hot chicks with 
hairy legs.

2118
01:30:26,971 --> 01:30:29,400
It was no chicks.
It was fucking weird.

2119
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:32,580
There was no Mexicans or black.
She refused to let you shave her legs.

2120
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:33,420
She was like,
listen,

2121
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:38,421
you have to accept me as I am.
Can you think you could fuck a chick or 

2122
01:30:38,421 --> 01:30:38,760
would you go live in Newton?
John on her leg work.

2123
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:42,990
I guess I don't mind too much if it's 
like light hair,

2124
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:45,120
but like dark hair.
Like what's that?

2125
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:50,170
That precious chick,
her legs just make me want to fucking 

2126
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:53,070
throw shit at her.
Like what the Fuck's wrong with you?

2127
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:59,820
Splatter of Shit.
It looks like tree trunks to her fucking

2128
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:01,170
husband.
That's just like.

2129
01:31:01,171 --> 01:31:04,860
I like to show you.
Do you just like not working?

2130
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,460
You're ridiculous.
Whew.

2131
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,470
That was what we were talking shit to 
people.

2132
01:31:10,471 --> 01:31:12,660
Everybody likes everything.
There's people that like things,

2133
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:14,130
but man,
if you.

2134
01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:19,190
If your grill doesn't shave her legs,
what does she do with her pussy in her 

2135
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:19,290
butthole?
That's the question.

2136
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:22,590
What kind of a fucking environmental 
hazard is that thing?

2137
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:28,040
What kind of a wasteland?
What kind of odiferous reaction are you 

2138
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,310
going to get when you get near her 
panties?

2139
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:34,970
Oh,
the funk of the 19 seventies of fucking 

2140
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:39,390
just just animal hair,
just for butthole and the inability to 

2141
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:44,370
completely clean everything because 
there's hair all around your bottle,

2142
01:31:44,371 --> 01:31:48,810
so every time you're fucking had just a 
slight smell of shit every single time,

2143
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:54,260
especially when sweat starts dripping 
down there and those big fat and bd 

2144
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:56,730
thighs start heating up and body wants 
to cool them down.

2145
01:31:56,731 --> 01:32:01,000
That perspiration drips down to her 
butthole and it just wafts up some fresh

2146
01:32:01,001 --> 01:32:06,001
new fumes and it's pussy,
funk and old butthole hairs and fucking 

2147
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,480
toilet papered thing.

2148
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:12,480
Go berries and you're nuts.
Slapping against it all and just like 

2149
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,880
you're fanning the fires and then right 
when you're about to bust it night,

2150
01:32:17,881 --> 01:32:19,740
you look down or hairy feet.
Oh,

2151
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:24,760
you didn't go soft and her China Dick 
and you've got to close your eyes and 

2152
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:29,281
plug your nose at the same time.
Try to regain your boat club people.

2153
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:34,990
She's got to be so gross.
Ever talking about that.

2154
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:39,991
When we're at the Strip club and I 
thought the young chick was behind me 

2155
01:32:39,991 --> 01:32:41,500
and I was so drunk.
That Strip club member.

2156
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:45,370
Oh my goodness,
this is like 2001 and Brian's defense.

2157
01:32:45,371 --> 01:32:47,470
This is a long,
long time ago.

2158
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:52,860
We were at a strip club and Brian was 
hammered and there was a woman who sat 

2159
01:32:53,471 --> 01:32:56,110
next to Brian and Brian started making 
out with this woman.

2160
01:32:56,810 --> 01:33:00,700
Let's first talk about there was a cute 
waitress that Brian was flirting with.

2161
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:05,730
This is what happened.
First there was just cute waitress at 

2162
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:05,730
blind.
Brian was flirting with and she was come

2163
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:08,230
and talking to him and she.
She gave him a drink and she said,

2164
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:13,270
I'll be back to talk to you in a minute,
and Brian was so shit faced that he 

2165
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:16,771
leaned back and closed his eyes and this
haggard old wizard woman,

2166
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:19,900
this which,
this,

2167
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:24,901
this,
this bitch just appeared out of nowhere 

2168
01:33:24,901 --> 01:33:26,530
and the whole deal is attacked me or 
something like,

2169
01:33:26,531 --> 01:33:28,510
yeah,
like in her fifties.

2170
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:32,650
Okay.
And not well kept like ragged,

2171
01:33:32,651 --> 01:33:37,651
ragged in her fifties with bad tattoos 
and a cutoff shirt like where her 

2172
01:33:37,781 --> 01:33:42,781
stomach was exposed and there's stretch 
marks from the 19 thirties on that 

2173
01:33:42,971 --> 01:33:46,270
fucking weathered old leather saddle of 
a stomach.

2174
01:33:46,271 --> 01:33:48,400
And her voice was cigarette.
Oh,

2175
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:53,440
just stinky breath.
And she didn't have all her teeth 

2176
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:53,440
either.
Man.

2177
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:54,610
She was missing a couple of teams.
I mean it was ridiculous.

2178
01:33:54,611 --> 01:33:59,611
So she sat down next to Brian and Brian 
Leans up against her like this and when 

2179
01:33:59,861 --> 01:34:04,861
Brian Leans up against her,
she grabs his head and he turns towards 

2180
01:34:04,861 --> 01:34:07,730
her and they start making out.
I thought it was the way chin.

2181
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:13,500
I'm like,
I gotta get this fucking kid out of 

2182
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:13,500
here.
How drunk is he?

2183
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,970
This is ridiculous.
Like this bitch just saw him hammered,

2184
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:17,440
and by the way,
we're at a table,

2185
01:34:17,441 --> 01:34:19,720
we're at a private little table,
so we didn't know her.

2186
01:34:19,721 --> 01:34:24,721
She just came over and sat down at our 
table and no one knew her and she just 

2187
01:34:24,721 --> 01:34:26,500
came over,
sat down like she's like a monster.

2188
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,530
And she saw a victim and she saw that he
was weak.

2189
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:34,650
She saw he was like so sloshed.
He couldn't keep his shit together and 

2190
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:37,810
he was leaning back and when he closed 
his eyes and leaned his head back,

2191
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:42,960
she just moved in for the kill.
She made the physical contact and he 

2192
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:47,371
didn't know.
He thought it was the girl and she had 

2193
01:34:47,371 --> 01:34:49,291
an arm on him like this.
So he just responded to the physical 

2194
01:34:49,291 --> 01:34:49,390
contact thinking that it was this hot 
waitress.

2195
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:54,870
Next thing you know their tongue in each
other and you have it on video until I 

2196
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:56,020
got it on video somewhere,
don't fuck around.

2197
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:59,510
We both have shit on each other.
So He's,

2198
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:03,950
he's tongue in this chick.
And then he looks at her and he looks at

2199
01:35:03,951 --> 01:35:04,850
her and he goes like this

2200
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:10,090
in the middle of it,
the middle of it.

2201
01:35:10,091 --> 01:35:15,091
He goes,
he looks at her and then he just turns 

2202
01:35:15,091 --> 01:35:17,491
away and she's like touching his face 
and everything and he just goes like 

2203
01:35:17,491 --> 01:35:21,211
this.
I got to go to the bathroom and you get 

2204
01:35:21,211 --> 01:35:23,461
up and go to the bathroom.
And she got up and walk away and you 

2205
01:35:23,461 --> 01:35:23,461
came back and go,
did I make out what?

2206
01:35:23,461 --> 01:35:27,991
That old lady.
What the fuck was that about?

2207
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,860
Dude?
I thought it was the waitress.

2208
01:35:33,190 --> 01:35:35,260
I totally thought it was the waitress.
Like,

2209
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:36,610
oh,
why didn't you stop me?

2210
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:39,340
We couldn't stop you.
How the fuck are going to stop you?

2211
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:41,560
She,
she sat down next to you.

2212
01:35:41,561 --> 01:35:44,770
You lean towards her and that pitches 
planned it perfectly.

2213
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:45,650
How many times does she

2214
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:47,000
done that?
I don't know.

2215
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:50,930
But the next morning when I was driving 
her back to her hotel,

2216
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:55,760
did she.
She never moved in again.

2217
01:35:55,761 --> 01:35:57,600
Right.
She realized that you realized that she,

2218
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:59,360
she took off right after that was her 
thing.

2219
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:00,780
Freaked her out.
Yeah.

2220
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:03,740
Because you freaked out and she was 
like,

2221
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:06,500
what the fuck did I do?
She realized that she had tricks,

2222
01:36:06,501 --> 01:36:10,490
some poor young man.
It just how gross it was that that chair

2223
01:36:10,491 --> 01:36:14,460
I was on at a strip club was a cloth 
chair now wanted to scrape the,

2224
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:19,570
the taste off my tongue.
So I started licking and dragging my 

2225
01:36:19,570 --> 01:36:22,190
tongue on the chair of a strip club.
You get the taste of her mouth off of my

2226
01:36:22,191 --> 01:36:24,230
tongue.
Is that bad?

2227
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,890
Why don't you just use liquor?
I don't wash it.

2228
01:36:27,891 --> 01:36:29,570
It's like,
Oh,

2229
01:36:29,571 --> 01:36:32,690
you were so horrified.
It was hilarious.

2230
01:36:32,691 --> 01:36:37,691
It didn't even seem real.
It seemed like you were punk at us like 

2231
01:36:37,691 --> 01:36:37,691
you were.
You were doing a sketch list.

2232
01:36:37,691 --> 01:36:39,980
You had hired this actress to come in to
make out with you.

2233
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:45,160
Just to freak us out.
I remember looking at your guys' faces 

2234
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:45,160
and you were recording me for one.
I'm like,

2235
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,250
why are they recording me?
That's kind of rude.

2236
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:51,470
But then you guys were all freaking out 
and I'm like,

2237
01:36:51,471 --> 01:36:56,471
I just remember then looking at her like
backing up a little and look at it and 

2238
01:36:56,471 --> 01:36:56,471
just,

2239
01:36:56,471 --> 01:36:58,500
ah,
what,

2240
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,270
what an awesome strategy and

2241
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:05,320
her part,
she recognized that you were ripe for 

2242
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:05,320
the taking,
you know,

2243
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:05,980
she like,
she just,

2244
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:09,240
she smelled blood in the water and she 
just plopped herself right next to you.

2245
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:14,040
Took Great God damn story actually 
deleted it.

2246
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:16,490
You did.
You tell her.

2247
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:18,750
I told you I will delete it.
You're freaking out.

2248
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:20,490
Do whatever you have that in your 
private.

2249
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:21,510
No,
no,

2250
01:37:21,511 --> 01:37:26,480
no.
I don't have the flashlight and the next

2251
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,290
day or you likely please delete that.
I said I'll,

2252
01:37:28,450 --> 01:37:29,230
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

2253
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:30,840
Don't worry.
I showed it to you though.

2254
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:33,600
Remember I showed it to you.
Really Watch it.

2255
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:38,630
You watch it for a couple of seconds.
Got To hate that in depth and look too 

2256
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:40,130
late.
That's the worst feeling.

2257
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:42,510
The next day when you wake up for being 
drunk and you're like,

2258
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:44,520
oh,
it is the worst feeling.

2259
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:45,900
Slap on the forehead.
Well,

2260
01:37:45,901 --> 01:37:47,550
how about like Eddie Bravo when he,
you know,

2261
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,940
he gets really hammered.
He,

2262
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,480
there's a couple times a year,
like two or three times a year.

2263
01:37:51,690 --> 01:37:53,100
Well,
he will not remember the night.

2264
01:37:53,370 --> 01:37:58,370
He really does not know what happened.
He's talking about was like every week 

2265
01:37:58,370 --> 01:37:58,370
at least.

2266
01:37:58,370 --> 01:37:58,370
I don't know.
I don't think it's every week.

2267
01:37:58,370 --> 01:37:59,160
Did he get a lot?
Dude?

2268
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:01,380
I don't know how many times he blacks 
out when you asked him.

2269
01:38:01,381 --> 01:38:03,450
He says a few times a year.
I believe him.

2270
01:38:04,530 --> 01:38:09,530
Maybe sometimes you forget to blacks 
keep blacks out about the black and out 

2271
01:38:09,530 --> 01:38:12,420
for the Best Eddie Bravo blackout story.
I told this in my blog,

2272
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:16,650
this is a totally true story.
It was like 8:00

2273
01:38:16,651 --> 01:38:19,200
in the morning or our car was picking us
up at nine.

2274
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:22,560
We were in Germany and I get up,
cause I'm gonna get some breakfast.

2275
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:24,870
So I call Eddie to see if he wants to 
get some breakfast.

2276
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,290
And he goes,
what's up?

2277
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:29,580
That's how I answered the phone.
I go,

2278
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:31,140
what's I go,
are you drunk?

2279
01:38:31,141 --> 01:38:36,141
He goes,
he's hammered.

2280
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:39,570
So I go,
okay dude,

2281
01:38:39,571 --> 01:38:40,680
I go,
our car is gonna.

2282
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:41,710
Get us in like an hour.

2283
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:42,930
Are you going to be ready?
Who's dude?

2284
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,050
I'm ready.
I'm just going to power to.

2285
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:46,350
I'm fine.
I'm ready.

2286
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:47,480
All right.
All right.

2287
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:48,900
I'll see you in an hour.
I'm going to get some breakfast.

2288
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:52,020
So I go and get some breakfast.
Hour goes by.

2289
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:55,230
I call him Santa answering.
I call his hotel room,

2290
01:38:55,260 --> 01:39:00,260
not answering.
I have someone go knock on his door not 

2291
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:00,510
answering.
He's not in this fucking room shit.

2292
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:02,190
And I'm like,
did he never come home?

2293
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:04,560
Did he get lost?
What the fuck is happening?

2294
01:39:04,910 --> 01:39:06,480
God dammit.
So I'm calling him.

2295
01:39:06,481 --> 01:39:09,060
He's not answering.
I go outside and I said,

2296
01:39:09,061 --> 01:39:10,470
well let me just throw my luggage in the
car.

2297
01:39:10,471 --> 01:39:12,660
So I say it to the Valet Guy.
I go,

2298
01:39:12,661 --> 01:39:15,000
there's a car here for Rogan.
And he goes,

2299
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:16,380
Joe Rogan.
And I go,

2300
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:18,180
okay,
that's my worst German accent ever.

2301
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:20,820
What is that?
What was the Indian or something?

2302
01:39:23,650 --> 01:39:26,550
Now I'm Colonel Klink.
Anyway,

2303
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:28,680
this fucking guy.
He goes,

2304
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:29,940
Joe Rogan.
He goes,

2305
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,560
Joe Rogan just left.
I go,

2306
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:31,920
no,
no,

2307
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:32,970
I'm Joe Rogan.
He goes,

2308
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:38,250
no,
a guy said he was Joe Rogan and gotten 

2309
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:38,250
your limo and left.
I said,

2310
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:39,210
what does he look like?
He goes,

2311
01:39:39,211 --> 01:39:40,770
long hair and tattoos.
I'm like,

2312
01:39:40,771 --> 01:39:43,470
that motherfucker,
because I knew it was eddie.

2313
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:48,650
Right.
There's not that many long haired 

2314
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:48,650
tattooed dudes in Germany.
Right.

2315
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:48,650
It's like,
oh fuck.

2316
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:50,220
So I call him up and he answers the 
phone.

2317
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:51,810
I go,
what are you doing?

2318
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:53,880
What's up?
I go,

2319
01:39:53,881 --> 01:39:55,740
what are you doing?
You're in my fucking car.

2320
01:39:57,890 --> 01:39:59,760
And he was looking at his watch and he 
goes,

2321
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:00,450
sir,
we're,

2322
01:40:00,451 --> 01:40:02,400
where are we right now in the driver 
says,

2323
01:40:02,401 --> 01:40:04,160
we're on our way to the airport.
He goes to,

2324
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,600
I guess what I'm wondering here probably
will come back and get me.

2325
01:40:07,070 --> 01:40:08,490
He goes,
how close are we to the airport?

2326
01:40:08,491 --> 01:40:09,330
He goes,
five minutes.

2327
01:40:09,331 --> 01:40:10,580
He goes to.
I go,

2328
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:13,410
how long you been in the car?
He had been in the car for an hour.

2329
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:15,600
Wow.
It's like an hour ride.

2330
01:40:15,601 --> 01:40:20,601
Was he sleeping when he got like when I 
got the phone with them at eight in the 

2331
01:40:20,601 --> 01:40:20,601
morning,
he went down there.

2332
01:40:20,601 --> 01:40:22,170
The car was already there.
Just told the guy he was me,

2333
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:27,370
got in the car and woke up like an hour 
into the drive on the way to the 

2334
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:31,521
airport,
woke up without any memory of the night 

2335
01:40:31,521 --> 01:40:34,671
whatsoever.
Woke up in the car with his phone 

2336
01:40:34,671 --> 01:40:37,971
ringing it literally.
That's like an old man.

2337
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:46,910
He literally had no idea what happened.
He doesn't remember a fucking thing 

2338
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:46,980
about the night.
Wow.

2339
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:51,660
That's crazy.
How terrifying must be to have like some

2340
01:40:51,661 --> 01:40:56,661
like just like litter of behavior around
you and you don't even know what you 

2341
01:40:57,311 --> 01:41:02,311
did.
Like you created all this problems and 

2342
01:41:02,311 --> 01:41:02,920
caused all these people.
Get all fucking angry at you and shed.

2343
01:41:02,921 --> 01:41:04,960
You don't even know what happened.
You were just shit faced.

2344
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:06,970
Blacked out,
gone.

2345
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:12,380
And then he had to get on a flight like 
I really long asked flight back home 

2346
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:14,610
with that hangover fucking 11 hours in 
Germany.

2347
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:19,110
Being drunk and hungover on a plane is 
probably the worst thing ever and I hate

2348
01:41:19,111 --> 01:41:19,860
it so much.

2349
01:41:20,190 --> 01:41:22,270
Is it though,
because you just sleep well?

2350
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:24,250
What's the big deal?
Is it harder?

2351
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,890
Is it really like.
Do you feel like you're at high altitude

2352
01:41:26,891 --> 01:41:28,580
when you're on a plane?
Obviously you're at high altitude,

2353
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:31,690
but the cabinets pressurized,
is there the same amount of oxygen there

2354
01:41:31,691 --> 01:41:36,691
is if you're at high altitude,
obviously not because like when you're 

2355
01:41:36,691 --> 01:41:36,691
at 30,000
feet,

2356
01:41:36,691 --> 01:41:38,720
that's like Mount Everest.
Like you could fucking die up there.

2357
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:40,810
There's no oxygen.
So that's a stupid question.

2358
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:46,440
Alright,
so this is obviously way more oxygen 

2359
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:46,440
than at 30,000
feet.

2360
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:46,440
That was a dumb question.
I can't believe I asked it.

2361
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:50,950
I believe in the weed,
but when you're,

2362
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:53,280
when you're in a plane,
does your hangover feeling any worse?

2363
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:58,350
To me it always does and it's usually,
well of course I have acid reflux and 

2364
01:41:58,350 --> 01:42:02,671
all this shit that's fucking with me and
so maybe it's worse for the Gremlin in 

2365
01:42:02,671 --> 01:42:03,820
your asshole.
So criminal in my Bailey Bailey.

2366
01:42:04,190 --> 01:42:05,600
Yeah.
There's something about planes,

2367
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:08,510
man.
Even if you sleep on a plane,

2368
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:09,180
even if you,
you know,

2369
01:42:09,181 --> 01:42:14,181
you go and you come back.
There's something about just getting up 

2370
01:42:14,181 --> 01:42:14,181
there,
traveling and coming back.

2371
01:42:14,181 --> 01:42:17,810
That leaves you feeling fucked up.
You just definitely feel a little off.

2372
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:19,480
What is that?
What is a plane?

2373
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:22,860
I think it's the change of pressure.

2374
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:28,020
The pressure or is it just getting in 
this tube with recycled oxygen and 

2375
01:42:29,381 --> 01:42:31,270
everybody's bringing their own Ehr?
Is that what it is?

2376
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:33,570
I think it's that because I actually saw
a report saying that those,

2377
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:37,370
that recycled air summit,
the best air and it's actually just like

2378
01:42:37,371 --> 01:42:42,371
an old wives tale that,
that it's bad for you and it's actually 

2379
01:42:42,371 --> 01:42:44,270
the filtering system in those planes are
so amazing.

2380
01:42:44,271 --> 01:42:49,271
That's pretty well.
What the fuck is it that makes you so 

2381
01:42:49,271 --> 01:42:49,271
tired from flying?

2382
01:42:49,271 --> 01:42:51,150
Cause that Shit Jacks you do.
There's no getting around it.

2383
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:55,050
It checks.
You know what I always like to do when I

2384
01:42:55,051 --> 01:42:56,610
land somewhere,
if I have the time,

2385
01:42:56,820 --> 01:43:01,820
I always have a hard workout.
One hard workout seems to reset 

2386
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:02,040
everything,
but if you don't have that hard workout,

2387
01:43:02,041 --> 01:43:03,800
man,
you're gonna.

2388
01:43:03,801 --> 01:43:05,640
You're gonna be fucked up for a couple 
of days.

2389
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:07,650
It takes a couple days to feel normal 
again.

2390
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:08,700
What is it?

2391
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:11,200
It's not good.
You know,

2392
01:43:11,201 --> 01:43:13,570
I was talking to thinking about this the
other day and it's kind of on subject,

2393
01:43:13,571 --> 01:43:18,571
but about workouts where you say,
I like how you know how you can even 

2394
01:43:18,571 --> 01:43:20,400
imagine.
To me when I forget who it.

2395
01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:22,720
Jimmy Kimmel was talking about this the 
other day where he,

2396
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:25,450
when he gets done working out,
he does not feel great.

2397
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:27,340
He feels awful.
He wants to go sleep.

2398
01:43:27,341 --> 01:43:28,270
He feels sad.
He's.

2399
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:30,670
He hates it and stuff like that.
But when you work out,

2400
01:43:30,671 --> 01:43:33,130
you have the exact opposite feeling.
You feel like,

2401
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,480
fuck yeah.
Yeah.

2402
01:43:34,481 --> 01:43:39,481
You know,
you're fired up and feel great and you 

2403
01:43:39,481 --> 01:43:39,481
feel great and like a natural.
I am like Jimmy Kimmel though.

2404
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:41,830
Like when I work out,
I'm not happy.

2405
01:43:41,831 --> 01:43:44,350
I'm miserable after I work out.
Well,

2406
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:45,250
why do you think that is?

2407
01:43:45,330 --> 01:43:46,620
It'll be two reasons for that.
One,

2408
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:51,630
because you're out of shape and working 
out as painful and then the recovery is 

2409
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:51,630
even more painful.
No,

2410
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:56,110
but even when I was in her shape,
better in shape and that would work out 

2411
01:43:56,110 --> 01:43:57,560
I never have.
Were you ever in really good shape?

2412
01:43:58,150 --> 01:43:59,060
Yeah.
Really?

2413
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:04,090
Yeah.
I've been in shape a couple times in my 

2414
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:04,090
life,
like pretty good shift.

2415
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:05,990
Were you working out and you feel I was 
working out every day,

2416
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:07,910
six days a week,
five days a week.

2417
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:09,880
When you're working on what kind of 
exercise you're doing,

2418
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:13,460
how much exercise are you doing?
Like 45 minutes to an hour of cardio and

2419
01:44:13,461 --> 01:44:14,630
then like 10,
10,

2420
01:44:14,631 --> 01:44:19,631
15 minutes of that was my prime was 43.
You like really fucking sweating and he 

2421
01:44:19,631 --> 01:44:19,631
even in Hawaii?
Yeah,

2422
01:44:19,631 --> 01:44:20,180
yeah.
Yeah.

2423
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:25,300
But I never,
never enjoyed it and always hated it 

2424
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:25,300
after it was done.

2425
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,230
Just a runner's high when it's over.
Oh Wow.

2426
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:28,850
That's the.
I was just wondering like,

2427
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:32,640
because like I've heard you talk about 
it before and then Kim was talking about

2428
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:34,190
it,
how is the exact opposite for him?

2429
01:44:34,191 --> 01:44:35,000
And I'm like,
yeah,

2430
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:38,090
that's same.
I tell you how your body works.

2431
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,280
Everybody's body has its own different 
thing.

2432
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:45,460
You know,
everybody's body works differently at 

2433
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:48,091
different levels of efficiency and some 
people's bodies need extreme amounts of 

2434
01:44:48,091 --> 01:44:49,190
exertion.
They need exercise.

2435
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:53,420
And mine could be because I grew up 
doing it because you know,

2436
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:54,550
my whole life I've,
I've,

2437
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:58,460
I mean there's never been a time in my 
life except like in between surgeries.

2438
01:44:58,770 --> 01:45:03,290
There's never been a time in my life 
where I didn't have some sort of extreme

2439
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:08,291
exertion,
whether it's kickboxing or Jujitsu or 

2440
01:45:08,291 --> 01:45:09,350
lifting weights or something,
or boxing for a while.

2441
01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:11,930
Everything was always just explosion.

2442
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:12,830
Always.
There's,

2443
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:15,500
my body's always been forced to behave a
certain way.

2444
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:20,150
And when your body's forced to behave 
like that for over 20 years,

2445
01:45:20,630 --> 01:45:22,460
you know,
it becomes accustomed to it.

2446
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:25,490
And when I take a few days off,
I take three or four days off.

2447
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:30,730
I have this buildup of energy where when
my body is used to producing a certain 

2448
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:31,640
amount of money,
I don't get any of that energy.

2449
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:32,630
Zero.
That energy.

2450
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:35,770
I actually have the opposite.
Like I think it's because hired 99.

2451
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:38,390
I've never really been in the kind of 
shape that kinda shape.

2452
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:41,300
Yeah.
I think for me,

2453
01:45:41,301 --> 01:45:44,660
and it's different.
Bio mechanics are not biomechanics.

2454
01:45:44,690 --> 01:45:46,520
Bio,
I'm a bio.

2455
01:45:46,521 --> 01:45:51,521
Rhythms rather biochemistry.
Different people need different things 

2456
01:45:51,521 --> 01:45:51,521
out of life.
You know,

2457
01:45:51,521 --> 01:45:53,450
some people need extreme exertion,
you know,

2458
01:45:53,451 --> 01:45:58,451
some people just need a walk,
some people feel great when they just 

2459
01:45:58,451 --> 01:45:58,451
walk up a hill,
you know,

2460
01:45:58,451 --> 01:46:02,320
they just go for a little walk around 
their neighborhood and they feel 

2461
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:02,320
refreshed.

2462
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:02,870
They don't need that extreme physical 
exertion.

2463
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:04,670
It me,
I need to hit the bag,

2464
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:07,250
I need to do Jujitsu,
I need to do some kettle bells,

2465
01:46:07,251 --> 01:46:08,800
I need to do it.
And when I do it it's like,

2466
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:15,110
like I can be myself again.
It's like I blow it all out and then I'm

2467
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,360
on myself,
but if I don't,

2468
01:46:17,361 --> 01:46:20,390
it builds up and builds up for one day.
It's tolerable.

2469
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:24,050
Two days it's a little less tolerable,
three days a little less and then by the

2470
01:46:24,051 --> 01:46:26,750
time four or five days go by where no 
workouts at all,

2471
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:29,030
I start getting very edgy,
you know,

2472
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:31,550
I feel like people were talking to me 
and they're not,

2473
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:34,130
they're not talking quick enough and I'm
a rude.

2474
01:46:34,131 --> 01:46:34,670
I'm like,
okay,

2475
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:35,870
okay,
okay.

2476
01:46:35,871 --> 01:46:36,740
I get it.
I get it.

2477
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,860
I get it because my patients has gone.
I just have no patience.

2478
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:41,540
It's weird.
It's caveman jeans.

2479
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:43,850
I've got way too much caveman in me,
you know,

2480
01:46:43,851 --> 01:46:48,851
there was some sort of a study recently 
that about people that have neanderthal 

2481
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:50,100
genetics and they have a certain

2482
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:55,100
percent fucking for sure.
I do for sure if there's people out 

2483
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:57,180
there that have neanderthal jeanette 
genetics and their system.

2484
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:00,030
I've got some of that shit for sure.
Somewhere in my life.

2485
01:47:00,031 --> 01:47:01,580
Somebody fucked an eight man,
you know,

2486
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:05,760
somewhere way,
way back in my family's ancestry.

2487
01:47:05,761 --> 01:47:10,761
Someone fucked one of those little crazy
eight men where I'm like a lesbian 

2488
01:47:10,761 --> 01:47:14,040
trapped in a man's body.
You are very feminine.

2489
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:19,800
You're very feminine,
but you liked girls.

2490
01:47:19,801 --> 01:47:21,960
What's that all about?
I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body,

2491
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:27,600
but you like fuck them.
I know that lesbians like fucking chicks

2492
01:47:27,601 --> 01:47:29,460
to do.
They do.

2493
01:47:29,461 --> 01:47:33,750
They put strap ons on and just get sad.
I would get fucking sad.

2494
01:47:34,770 --> 01:47:39,770
It was chicken.
I want it to be a dude and I'm putting 

2495
01:47:39,770 --> 01:47:40,470
this rubber Dick on a girl group with a 
paper.

2496
01:47:40,471 --> 01:47:45,471
Really fucking add one.
I could really just fucked the shit out 

2497
01:47:45,471 --> 01:47:46,650
of you with my real dick to those rubber
thing.

2498
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:50,360
I got up.
Tie on and strap in place and it wiggles

2499
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:55,370
and doesn't,
but yet says scissoring probably feel 

2500
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:56,370
good because you open sores rubbing 
against each other.

2501
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:59,190
The most sensitive part,
they want to get stuffed.

2502
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:04,280
They're missing a whole.
They're missing something in the middle 

2503
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:04,280
that want to get stuff,
dude.

2504
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:08,780
Yeah,
but I mean you could throw a fucking 

2505
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:08,780
dildo and you're probably feels the same
or better.

2506
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:09,780
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

2507
01:48:09,781 --> 01:48:11,540
Flashlights,
they feel pretty fucking good.

2508
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,070
I mean,
I don't know how Lesbians Vagina feels,

2509
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:17,220
but I think heterosexual woman 
desperately need to get stuffed.

2510
01:48:17,610 --> 01:48:22,610
That's why dudes desperately need to 
stuffing in them and it just makes 

2511
01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:22,610
sense.
What feels the best to you?

2512
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:27,680
The magical fucking promise land to get 
your hard supersensitive Dick inside the

2513
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:31,470
word pussy.
And that's nature.

2514
01:48:31,471 --> 01:48:33,120
That's the.
That's the great reward.

2515
01:48:33,121 --> 01:48:36,060
The great reward is this intense 
pleasure because that's the way you make

2516
01:48:36,061 --> 01:48:36,540
babies.

2517
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:41,660
So for a woman,
the intense pleasure has got to come 

2518
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:44,211
from getting stuffed.
It's the owning that makes sense from 

2519
01:48:44,211 --> 01:48:44,760
getting a big fat dick to shoot goo 
inside you.

2520
01:48:45,090 --> 01:48:46,470
You know?
That's what it is.

2521
01:48:46,670 --> 01:48:47,060
I mean,
it's,

2522
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:52,720
and it's a,
it's a staple of our life and it's this 

2523
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:53,940
big important part of our desires and 
our motivation to do things,

2524
01:48:53,941 --> 01:48:57,270
but really it's just a trick to make 
people you know,

2525
01:48:57,330 --> 01:49:02,330
and that,
that trick is got to be set up 

2526
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:02,330
correctly.
I mean,

2527
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:03,660
people have been around for a fucking 
million years in this form.

2528
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:06,180
That trick is good.
They got it down and if it's,

2529
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:07,460
if it's down,
they got a good,

2530
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:10,920
then that means chicks must love big 
fucking dicks inside them.

2531
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:16,040
And if they do,
then scissoring is not going to be 

2532
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:16,040
enough.
It's gonna feel good,

2533
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:19,311
it'll feel good.
But the reality is that actually wants 

2534
01:49:19,311 --> 01:49:21,840
to get filled up and once you get 
fucking stretched out with Cox on you 

2535
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:26,040
and looking at me and talking about 
coffee all day long,

2536
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:28,800
try to make it uncomfortable.

2537
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,800
So I try to make you uncomfortable.
I'm damn well is that,

2538
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:39,990
that's me laugh.
It was an earthquake.

2539
01:49:39,991 --> 01:49:44,991
We have much better sound now,
so when I'm laughing and what used to 

2540
01:49:44,991 --> 01:49:47,350
not be annoying now it will be annoying.
This week we're using these microphones,

2541
01:49:47,351 --> 01:49:52,351
but next week we're going to have some 
clip on jammies because this is 

2542
01:49:52,351 --> 01:49:54,391
ridiculous.
You don't want to be standing here like 

2543
01:49:54,391 --> 01:49:54,391
a standup comedian.
I do kind of like it though for the fact

2544
01:49:54,391 --> 01:49:55,960
if I need to like drink water or do 
something,

2545
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:57,550
I could go like this.
Yeah.

2546
01:49:58,150 --> 01:50:03,150
Yeah.
Maybe we should just leave it like this 

2547
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:03,150
because maybe getting a mic stand.
It goes right here though,

2548
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:04,060
so we can.
Yeah,

2549
01:50:04,061 --> 01:50:09,061
we could totally do that,
but I just don't want anything that 

2550
01:50:09,061 --> 01:50:09,061
knocks around it.
As long as we have the headphones on,

2551
01:50:09,061 --> 01:50:13,170
that's the move because for the longest 
time we were doing this and I just look,

2552
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:18,220
we're,
we're a couple of retards and we shoe 

2553
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:18,430
string this shit together,
but now it looks pretty killer.

2554
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:20,830
We got like we had a mixer board and 
shit.

2555
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:22,450
I'll show you guys all this stuff.
By the way,

2556
01:50:22,451 --> 01:50:25,570
the autofocus is not something that you 
could turn off.

2557
01:50:26,570 --> 01:50:29,110
It doesn't look like it.
We got all this shit here.

2558
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:34,410
We've got a soundboard now connected to 
the two laptops connected to this high 

2559
01:50:35,591 --> 01:50:40,591
level MP3 recorded.
Jamey and it's all just mishmashed and 

2560
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:45,660
fucking sea of wires and that all 
creates this podcast.

2561
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:49,990
Hopefully that'll be enough.
So now that we have the sound issues out

2562
01:50:49,991 --> 01:50:54,991
of the way,
eventually we're going to have to deal 

2563
01:50:54,991 --> 01:50:54,991
with this goddamn green screen.
That's step two.

2564
01:50:54,991 --> 01:50:56,410
I've.
There's a couple different options to do

2565
01:50:56,411 --> 01:51:01,411
it,
but all of them seem super fucking 

2566
01:51:01,411 --> 01:51:01,411
complicated in a pain in the ass.
Yeah.

2567
01:51:01,411 --> 01:51:02,710
I think we just do a TV,
get a three D tv.

2568
01:51:02,711 --> 01:51:04,780
We can check shit out.
We can turn it on.

2569
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:10,360
Things that we couldn't do it through 
this ustream producer if we're going to 

2570
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:12,230
do it right.
The caster,

2571
01:51:12,330 --> 01:51:15,340
the fucking track asked her.
I think you can go through that.

2572
01:51:15,341 --> 01:51:18,460
I think you can do it through that.
So then we would have this entire,

2573
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:21,010
the same audio setup.
I think that's just way overkill and you

2574
01:51:21,011 --> 01:51:23,650
do a tri caster,
three ustream producer now it just seems

2575
01:51:23,651 --> 01:51:28,120
weird post on twitter,
if anybody knows to give us a simple way

2576
01:51:28,121 --> 01:51:29,920
to do a green screen.
If you know,

2577
01:51:29,921 --> 01:51:34,921
if anybody knows,
throw me up some message or a link on 

2578
01:51:34,921 --> 01:51:36,700
twitter at Joe Rogan,
there's got to be some tech audio visual

2579
01:51:36,701 --> 01:51:41,701
wizard out there that knows how to use.
We should tell you stream what's the 

2580
01:51:41,701 --> 01:51:42,430
best hookup.
I don't think ustream knows.

2581
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:44,830
Now.
They stopped doing those ads.

2582
01:51:44,831 --> 01:51:47,410
They have these ads that would pop up 
every 30 seconds.

2583
01:51:48,010 --> 01:51:49,720
Remember there was a bunch of people are
complaining.

2584
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:50,630
Well,
ads.

2585
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:55,640
It wasn't just an ad that popped up.
It was like took over the sound and 

2586
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:55,960
audio and video.
That was ridiculous.

2587
01:51:56,490 --> 01:51:58,330
Who was it for?
Was it macy's?

2588
01:51:58,331 --> 01:52:01,240
Macy's.
Which macy's want to have anything to do

2589
01:52:01,241 --> 01:52:02,690
with me too because they have fucking 
guns.

2590
01:52:02,700 --> 01:52:07,180
I'm talking about ghetto gaggers.
Where did you hear about that Dildo that

2591
01:52:07,181 --> 01:52:08,530
was discovered.
Twenty 8,000

2592
01:52:08,531 --> 01:52:10,840
year old though.
Did you hear about that?

2593
01:52:10,841 --> 01:52:12,660
Do you know?
How do they know that it was a Dildo?

2594
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:15,770
Not just like an ear cleaner or like a 
year care massager.

2595
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:17,920
Big is your fucking ears side.
You know what I mean?

2596
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:21,220
Because it looks like a big stone Dick 
and it's eight inches long.

2597
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:24,100
Maybe it was the preferred site was used
for something else.

2598
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:27,180
What was it was used to strike flint's 
too.

2599
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:30,850
They had all these marks on it from 
someone's striking flint's,

2600
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:32,750
but that just could have been the 
husband like,

2601
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:35,470
give me that fucking vibrator.
GimMe Your Gimme your dildo.

2602
01:52:35,471 --> 01:52:40,471
I need to make a fire.
He got all angry and shit and he was 

2603
01:52:40,471 --> 01:52:40,471
attacking the Dick,
you know,

2604
01:52:40,471 --> 01:52:45,001
it could have been that because that's 
the reason why he used it as a dual 

2605
01:52:45,001 --> 01:52:45,001
purpose instrument.

2606
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,640
But that'd be a smart move to have,
you know.

2607
01:52:47,650 --> 01:52:51,290
I mean if you don't want to have that 
many stones land around the cave,

2608
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:53,960
you know,
why not use it for dual purposes.

2609
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:56,620
I was in Portland and they had the or 
that,

2610
01:52:56,630 --> 01:53:01,160
the biggest top rex with all the bones.
The best selection.

2611
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:02,690
No.
T rex o,

2612
01:53:02,691 --> 01:53:04,820
t,
o really had the biggest collection,

2613
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:06,250
a t rex,
and it was like,

2614
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:09,530
I forget how many,
like 70 percent real bone.

2615
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:14,650
Whoa.
Like the whole thing was up and it's so 

2616
01:53:14,650 --> 01:53:15,770
weird sitting there by that skull of 
this dinosaur and just thinking,

2617
01:53:15,771 --> 01:53:18,320
wow,
that used to be a fucking monster,

2618
01:53:18,321 --> 01:53:19,670
you know,
that was a real thing.

2619
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:23,090
So weird that you're allowed to like go 
up to it and touch it,

2620
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:28,100
see it and wonder how many things 
existed that there are not fossils of.

2621
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:33,050
Because one of the things when you start
reading things about fossils and about,

2622
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:38,080
you know,
archeologists and all these different 

2623
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,571
people are trying to dig up the past is 
that it's really difficult to make a 

2624
01:53:40,571 --> 01:53:41,090
fossil.

2625
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:43,190
Like fossils don't just happen all the 
time.

2626
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:45,260
Like an animal has to get trapped in 
mud.

2627
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:48,410
They have to die and you know,
some sort of a landslide or something.

2628
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:50,510
They have to be somehow or another 
preserved,

2629
01:53:50,511 --> 01:53:53,270
which usually doesn't happen.
Usually when someone dies,

2630
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:54,920
they rot in.
Their bones,

2631
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:59,921
get eaten up by animals and their tissue
gets eaten up by animals and bacteria 

2632
01:53:59,921 --> 01:53:59,921
and then they're gone.
They dissolve.

2633
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:03,230
How many fucking things existed that 
aren't in the fossil record,

2634
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:05,030
you know,
properly.

2635
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,170
There's a lot.
Probably the majority really thinks so.

2636
01:54:07,770 --> 01:54:12,770
You would think though that species 
around for millions and millions of 

2637
01:54:12,770 --> 01:54:12,770
years,
right?

2638
01:54:12,770 --> 01:54:12,770
Most of them,
you know,

2639
01:54:12,770 --> 01:54:17,200
they're around for a long period of time
and then eventually they die off and 

2640
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:20,351
before they die off for whatever reason,
we've had plenty of opportunity for at 

2641
01:54:20,351 --> 01:54:21,420
least a few of them to get stuck places.
Right?

2642
01:54:21,660 --> 01:54:22,060
Right.

2643
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:25,430
We did.
We know so little.

2644
01:54:25,431 --> 01:54:30,431
It's so crazy that we try to reproduce 
the past or figure out what happened in 

2645
01:54:30,431 --> 01:54:32,540
the past by studying what was left 
behind.

2646
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:35,870
It's like a giant crazy puzzle.
Wouldn't it be more?

2647
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:40,190
Wouldn't it be incredible and maybe this
will be possible some day if they figure

2648
01:54:40,191 --> 01:54:43,360
out like say if they make a model like 
of,

2649
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:44,750
of the,
of the earth,

2650
01:54:44,751 --> 01:54:49,751
like they know like what existed as far 
as like if you could do like a core 

2651
01:54:49,751 --> 01:54:53,561
sample of the earth,
you can determine what the temperature 

2652
01:54:53,561 --> 01:54:54,530
was like,
what the environment was like,

2653
01:54:54,531 --> 01:54:59,531
what animals and plants existed and what
if they could put all this data into a 

2654
01:54:59,531 --> 01:55:01,430
computer.
What if they could put like core samples

2655
01:55:01,431 --> 01:55:03,800
and what we know about climate illogical
change on the shit,

2656
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:09,010
put it into a computer with the known 
all the known animals that exist today 

2657
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:14,020
and literally run a computer program 
that goes backwards and evolution and 

2658
01:55:14,691 --> 01:55:18,920
takes us to what existed tens of 
thousands of years ago to 100,000

2659
01:55:18,921 --> 01:55:20,420
years ago,
a million years ago,

2660
01:55:20,421 --> 01:55:25,421
10 million years ago,
and you have to account for known 

2661
01:55:25,421 --> 01:55:26,360
asteroid impacts,
known craters,

2662
01:55:26,361 --> 01:55:31,361
known things that probably wiped out 
almost everything that they're going to 

2663
01:55:31,361 --> 01:55:32,270
get to a point in time,
computationally,

2664
01:55:32,271 --> 01:55:34,130
scientifically,
technologically,

2665
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:38,300
where they're literally able to recreate
the past with a computer.

2666
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:41,780
Totally.
What the fuck son?

2667
01:55:41,930 --> 01:55:44,700
What kind of crazy world we live in?
A won't see it will be dead.

2668
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:46,080
You think so?
I don't think.

2669
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:48,420
I'm not that confident.
We might see the beginning.

2670
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:49,860
I think we're going to see some crazy 
shit.

2671
01:55:49,861 --> 01:55:52,020
Dude.
I think you with your bloody butthole.

2672
01:55:52,050 --> 01:55:53,700
You might not,
but me.

2673
01:55:53,701 --> 01:55:56,160
I'm going to live to be a couple more 
decades for sure.

2674
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,770
I've got a few decades semester still on
a 62 years old.

2675
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:03,030
It looks like he's a fucking stud.
If he's alive,

2676
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:05,240
he's alive.
I'm not going to last till next poet.

2677
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:10,920
You know?
When do you think when you think you're 

2678
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:10,920
going to go Sunday,
Sunday,

2679
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:15,530
don't say that I'm going to miss you.
Don't die to be reborn in your new 

2680
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:15,530
child.
Wow,

2681
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:17,340
that's creepy.
Really creepy.

2682
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:19,600
Cause I'm about to have a new child.
You don't even know it.

2683
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:20,790
Brian died tomorrow.

2684
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:25,800
Then my daughter woke up or came out of 
the Pussy and looked at me and was like,

2685
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:32,180
Hey,
I got with me at a strip club and 

2686
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:33,210
started saying things like that.
Brian says like first words like shit.

2687
01:56:33,211 --> 01:56:36,540
Brian says all the time.
We find a way to do it.

2688
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:40,140
Don't come back as my child.
That would be just rude.

2689
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:45,480
Very rude.
Let my wife soccer sucking on my wife's 

2690
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:45,480
ticks.
That's creepy.

2691
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:50,300
Fucking Weirdo.
Why would you want to come back as a 

2692
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:50,300
baby?
A baby girl.

2693
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:54,050
Start this party.
Can you imagine just coming back as a 

2694
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:54,300
baby girl and you have the mind of a 
man.

2695
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:59,720
Thirty four year old man trapped in a 
baby girl that's fake dicks on Brian.

2696
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,140
Oh Brian,
what's your fake Dick Talk.

2697
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:06,360
Let's go to the chat.
See if there's anything interesting that

2698
01:57:06,361 --> 01:57:09,260
anybody has to say.
I'm going to urinate and what's this?

2699
01:57:09,290 --> 01:57:11,940
This is what's wrong with the Internet?
What's for me?

2700
01:57:11,941 --> 01:57:13,950
Link.
What the fuck is that guy saying?

2701
01:57:14,430 --> 01:57:19,320
If you survive the next 30 years,
you could possibly immortal through cell

2702
01:57:19,321 --> 01:57:20,580
regeneration.
Yeah.

2703
01:57:20,581 --> 01:57:23,940
That is possible.
Or it might even be weirder.

2704
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:29,180
What the Ray Crets we'll idea is that 
we're going to be able to download 

2705
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:31,950
consciousness into a computer.
That's a very possible idea.

2706
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:37,170
You know,
if they can figure out a way to make 

2707
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:38,730
some sort of a reproduction of the human
mind,

2708
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:44,010
like like some,
some sort of a computer that actually 

2709
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:46,941
whether it's a software or a hardware 
issue where you reproduce all the 

2710
01:57:46,941 --> 01:57:50,691
functions of a human brain and then 
somehow or another download 

2711
01:57:50,691 --> 01:57:55,071
consciousness into that computer and you
could use that and replicate it and you 

2712
01:57:55,171 --> 01:58:00,171
can.
You could like literally exist in a 

2713
01:58:00,171 --> 01:58:01,770
bunch of different fucking computers.
That would be very strange if it was all

2714
01:58:01,771 --> 01:58:06,771
happening,
like say if you downloaded your 

2715
01:58:06,771 --> 01:58:08,691
consciousness into computers,
but your consciousness was still 

2716
01:58:08,691 --> 01:58:10,160
attached to those computers,
so instead of you know,

2717
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:15,340
you being able to live a different life 
inside this computer would if like that 

2718
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:19,611
life is going on at the same time,
I can echo in your head and everything 

2719
01:58:19,611 --> 01:58:23,331
you do is like doubled and tripled and 
it's like you go fucking crazy because 

2720
01:58:23,331 --> 01:58:27,381
your consciousness isn't a bunch of 
different computers and all these 

2721
01:58:27,381 --> 01:58:27,381
different things are going on at the 
same time,

2722
01:58:27,381 --> 01:58:31,131
but it's all inside your head and you 
can't fucking get away and you ruined 

2723
01:58:31,131 --> 01:58:31,131
it.

2724
01:58:31,131 --> 01:58:34,130
So you gotta find the computers that 
have your consciousness in it and 

2725
01:58:34,130 --> 01:58:36,531
fucking killed them.
Just to stop the madness in your head 

2726
01:58:36,531 --> 01:58:39,651
because there's a fucking crazy echo 
because you're living a thousand 

2727
01:58:39,651 --> 01:58:40,680
different lives all at once inside 
fucking computers.

2728
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:41,980
I didn't smell

2729
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,690
like pussy.
I forgot to take a shower this morning.

2730
01:58:43,691 --> 01:58:46,720
It was like,
this is awesome.

2731
01:58:46,721 --> 01:58:48,180
How bad is it?
Good.

2732
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:50,290
It's all good.
I love that she's not supposed to.

2733
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:54,150
It's pussies to smells none or awful and
not supposed to smell,

2734
01:58:54,170 --> 01:58:57,040
but just that slight pussy where you had
slight pussy.

2735
01:58:57,041 --> 01:59:02,041
Yeah.
I think you're thinking that it's just 

2736
01:59:02,041 --> 01:59:02,041
like pussy,
but really it's your dead loads.

2737
01:59:02,041 --> 01:59:06,450
That's what I think it is.
I think you're getting all excited 

2738
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:06,450
smelling your own loads.
That's what it is.

2739
01:59:06,610 --> 01:59:09,280
It's your own loeser trapped in your 
underwear.

2740
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:11,020
You might be right.
I think that's what it is,

2741
01:59:11,021 --> 01:59:13,020
man.
Probably my butthole smell

2742
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:20,770
these rampage versus Rashad.
Who's going to win?

2743
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:22,000
Listen,
Ladies and gentlemen,

2744
01:59:22,001 --> 01:59:24,280
I'm never,
never going to answer.

2745
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:26,350
I don't know who the fuck is going to 
win.

2746
01:59:26,390 --> 01:59:27,400
That's why they're fighting,
man.

2747
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:32,640
That's the whole deal.
I'm not doing a comedy when I'm coming 

2748
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:33,640
to Vancouver this time because I was 
supposed to do the Red Robinson theater,

2749
01:59:33,641 --> 01:59:36,150
but apparently they have some sort of a,
a,

2750
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:41,160
a corporate thing that they booked out 
for three days in a row and they can't 

2751
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:44,551
cancel it and that's the only time I'm 
going to be there and they didn't want 

2752
01:59:44,551 --> 01:59:45,190
me doing another club because I always 
do their club.

2753
01:59:45,191 --> 01:59:47,710
I sort of have an agreement,
so it's a big theater.

2754
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:53,400
So uh,
this time I'm not going to be doing 

2755
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:53,400
shit,
so I'm going to go find bad.

2756
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:56,911
Bobby.
We're going to go eat steak like men 

2757
01:59:56,911 --> 01:59:57,910
essentially around Vancouver.
Alright.

2758
01:59:58,090 --> 01:59:59,360
Other questions here?
See,

2759
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:02,320
talk about overeem.
You don't even know overeem is.

2760
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:04,030
You only follow UFC,
right?

2761
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:06,400
You didn't see the strike force on 
showtime.

2762
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:08,230
You portfolio.
You missed out on everything.

2763
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:10,310
I didn't know how.
Showtime Dude.

2764
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:13,890
Alistair overeem is a motherfucker.
He beat the shit out of Brett Rogers.

2765
02:00:14,270 --> 02:00:16,450
Brett Rogers was that guy that fought 
fate or last?

2766
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:18,460
You don't care.
Don't give a fuck.

2767
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,350
I don't care about something.
It's not that.

2768
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:23,470
Not that fight.
Bumper sticker idea.

2769
02:00:23,471 --> 02:00:25,180
Real Catholics.
Fuck kids.

2770
02:00:25,330 --> 02:00:26,440
Wow.
Okay fellow.

2771
02:00:28,610 --> 02:00:30,520
So a lot of bad questions here in this 
trap.

2772
02:00:32,130 --> 02:00:35,570
Do you know what Mark Emery is?
[inaudible] you know that guy's there.

2773
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:40,640
Extraditing him or have extra added him 
to America or just to spend five years 

2774
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:43,320
in jail for selling seeds.
Seeds that make people happy.

2775
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:45,750
Pot seeds.
Meanwhile his own country.

2776
02:00:45,870 --> 02:00:47,430
Not only the,
not prosecuting him,

2777
02:00:47,431 --> 02:00:49,920
he was roaming the streets free.
You know,

2778
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:54,980
he was fine and his own country,
he was fine and there extraditing him 

2779
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:59,061
because you know,
they're saying he's responsible for 

2780
02:00:59,061 --> 02:00:59,061
millions dollars of sales of seeds here 
in America and you know,

2781
02:00:59,061 --> 02:01:01,720
I ran a drug empire by selling

2782
02:01:01,850 --> 02:01:02,550
seeds.
You know what?

2783
02:01:02,551 --> 02:01:03,980
I pretty fucked up.
It's fucked up.

2784
02:01:03,981 --> 02:01:08,981
But you know,
I don't feel bad about because that's 

2785
02:01:08,981 --> 02:01:08,981
the risk you take when you have to do 
shit.

2786
02:01:08,981 --> 02:01:10,490
Like selling seeds and stuff like that.
You know what I mean?

2787
02:01:10,810 --> 02:01:12,680
You don't feel bad.
I mean I feel bad,

2788
02:01:12,681 --> 02:01:15,290
but I also like if I was selling 
marijuana seeds,

2789
02:01:15,291 --> 02:01:20,291
I would know that hey,
there's a slight chance that I could be 

2790
02:01:20,291 --> 02:01:23,051
fucked somehow.
But in his country that is not in his 

2791
02:01:23,051 --> 02:01:23,051
country.
It's totally legal.

2792
02:01:23,051 --> 02:01:23,420
The problem.
He was shipping them to America.

2793
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:26,210
If he never shipped them to America and 
just sold them in Canada,

2794
02:01:26,211 --> 02:01:28,100
he'd be gold.
It sounds like he's dumb for Canada.

2795
02:01:28,101 --> 02:01:33,101
They don't give a fuck.
I mean they do when they have to deal 

2796
02:01:33,101 --> 02:01:33,101
with shit,
but the reality is like,

2797
02:01:33,101 --> 02:01:35,270
it's like it's not really legal in 
Vancouver,

2798
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:37,910
but it's legal.
I mean they tolerate it,

2799
02:01:37,911 --> 02:01:39,080
they just let it,
let it happen.

2800
02:01:39,110 --> 02:01:39,980
Dad smoke shops

2801
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,900
and shit,
just like answer them up there,

2802
02:01:41,990 --> 02:01:46,990
you know,
when you could just go and smoke weed 

2803
02:01:46,990 --> 02:01:48,371
and this motherfucker was just out in 
the open with it and selling seeds to 

2804
02:01:48,371 --> 02:01:50,390
America and now they're,
they're extraditing him.

2805
02:01:50,391 --> 02:01:53,180
He's gonna have to do five years in jail
and he's not a young man.

2806
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:58,210
That's a long ass fucking time to be 
locked in a cage for a plant that makes 

2807
02:01:58,210 --> 02:01:58,340
you a silly,
you know,

2808
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:03,640
the fact that that's still even debated 
in 2010 that would be wasting any 

2809
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:06,530
resources at all processing,
prosecuting anyone for pot.

2810
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:09,260
It mean even a little bit.
Even if you know they're saying he broke

2811
02:02:09,261 --> 02:02:12,110
the law.
So what the thought is fucking stupid.

2812
02:02:12,111 --> 02:02:14,390
It's a dumb fucking law.
The law is stupid.

2813
02:02:14,391 --> 02:02:16,430
But he knew what he was doing.
So what?

2814
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:18,530
It doesn't matter the laws.
Dumb.

2815
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:19,920
Well then do it.

2816
02:02:20,110 --> 02:02:21,080
Yes.
But no,

2817
02:02:21,081 --> 02:02:26,081
he should be able to do it.
Know you shouldn't be able to put a guy 

2818
02:02:26,081 --> 02:02:26,081
in jail for that.
That's ridiculous.

2819
02:02:26,081 --> 02:02:29,600
That in 2010 we got so many 
discrepancies,

2820
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:32,720
so many fucked up hypocritical 
situations in our culture.

2821
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:37,810
How about gambling?
How about the fact that dudes are 

2822
02:02:37,810 --> 02:02:37,810
getting busted,
having poker games,

2823
02:02:37,810 --> 02:02:40,790
you know that people are getting busted,
like they're breaking open private poker

2824
02:02:40,791 --> 02:02:43,220
games and cops are coming and taking 
money and shed.

2825
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:48,520
I've read a bunch of stories about shit 
like this happening where people are 

2826
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:50,120
getting in trouble for gambling,
playing poker with their own money.

2827
02:02:50,450 --> 02:02:52,920
I mean this is one of the reasons why 
you have to go to these God damn Indian.

2828
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:54,680
Not that there's anything wrong with it.
Any casino,

2829
02:02:54,710 --> 02:02:56,780
but you have to go to Indian casinos.
You can't have one.

2830
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:59,220
You can have a casino like down the 
street from your house.

2831
02:02:59,590 --> 02:03:01,970
It has to be in certain places and the 
only place,

2832
02:03:01,971 --> 02:03:03,320
certain games in them,
you know,

2833
02:03:03,620 --> 02:03:08,620
I mean there's a lot of them in 
California and was bellflower and 

2834
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:11,681
there's a few in most parts of the 
country it's very difficult to find 

2835
02:03:11,681 --> 02:03:13,040
casinos and you can't play poker online 
because it's illegal.

2836
02:03:13,130 --> 02:03:18,130
So if you want to play online,
you have to go through like a third 

2837
02:03:18,130 --> 02:03:19,160
party and it's like you have to like 
send your money into someplace.

2838
02:03:19,161 --> 02:03:24,161
It's fucking all cryptic and weird and 
you don't know what the fuck is 

2839
02:03:24,161 --> 02:03:24,161
happening.
And it's all probably illegal anyway.

2840
02:03:24,161 --> 02:03:25,810
If you got in trouble for doing it the 
way you're doing it,

2841
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:30,860
even if you do it through a third party,
you could probably get some sort of a 

2842
02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:31,880
fine or something for it.
I mean,

2843
02:03:31,881 --> 02:03:33,830
I don't know what they could do to you,
but it's illegal,

2844
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:38,920
you know,
but me of the government has a fucking 

2845
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:38,920
lottery.

2846
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:38,920
I mean,
you know,

2847
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:42,551
the lotteries,
the worst odds available ever for 

2848
02:03:42,551 --> 02:03:42,551
gambling.
You ever been stuck behind someone who's

2849
02:03:42,551 --> 02:03:47,260
a lottery?
Some poor fucking lady was in front of 

2850
02:03:47,260 --> 02:03:47,360
me the other day at the gas station and 
uh,

2851
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:52,460
I'm,
I'm getting a gatorade with my gas was 

2852
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:55,241
gatorade theme day.
Notice that you had some gatorade and I 

2853
02:03:55,241 --> 02:03:55,241
had some gatorade.
I'm going to gatorade and this poor lady

2854
02:03:55,241 --> 02:04:00,041
orders like 10 of these things and she's
like furiously scratching at these 

2855
02:04:00,041 --> 02:04:00,830
tickets and you're like,
this lady's like addicted man.

2856
02:04:01,010 --> 02:04:01,550
Like,
look at her.

2857
02:04:01,580 --> 02:04:03,920
She's,
she's playing the worst odds ever.

2858
02:04:03,950 --> 02:04:08,950
She's bought 10 tickets.
What are the odds that any of them are 

2859
02:04:08,950 --> 02:04:08,950
going to be any good?
Pretty fucking low.

2860
02:04:08,950 --> 02:04:10,480
Ever won anything from this before?
No,

2861
02:04:10,570 --> 02:04:15,570
I've won like 10 bucks.
I want a free ticket once I play the a 

2862
02:04:15,570 --> 02:04:15,570
lot.
The lottery.

2863
02:04:15,570 --> 02:04:16,400
I won a free ticket.
I played that free ticket.

2864
02:04:16,430 --> 02:04:17,600
I lost.
I was done.

2865
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:20,530
That was it never played again.
But the fucking,

2866
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:22,520
the odds are astronomical.
And the,

2867
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:24,620
you know,
the hook is that if you do,

2868
02:04:24,621 --> 02:04:27,260
when it's so much money,
oh my God.

2869
02:04:27,261 --> 02:04:30,200
You could do a dollar a dollar a dollar 
for a hundred days.

2870
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:32,840
Then all of a sudden you win $5,000.
Whoa.

2871
02:04:33,010 --> 02:04:35,000
And they put $100 investment in,
but it was worth it.

2872
02:04:35,150 --> 02:04:37,020
And then once you get that one,
$5,000,

2873
02:04:37,230 --> 02:04:37,950
you're like,
oh,

2874
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:42,030
you get addicted to come in to win the 
super fucking power ball jackpot.

2875
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:44,460
$400,
million dollars be set for life.

2876
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:50,000
You know,
still the government is the biggest 

2877
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:50,000
fucking dealer when it comes to addicted
gamblers.

2878
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:52,200
You know,
the government is dishing it out.

2879
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:52,920
You can,
you could,

2880
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:57,980
you could gamble,
lottery and every fucking state 

2881
02:04:57,980 --> 02:04:57,980
probably,
right?

2882
02:04:57,980 --> 02:05:01,390
Because they're a state where you can't 
gamble state where you can't go to the 

2883
02:05:01,390 --> 02:05:01,860
lottery thing.
So how about the Gundam stock market?

2884
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:03,970
That's a fucking gamble.
That's a gamble.

2885
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,630
It's legal.
Why can't you fucking play poker?

2886
02:05:06,810 --> 02:05:09,330
It's ridiculous.
We live in a goddamn nanny state.

2887
02:05:09,980 --> 02:05:11,160
The nanny state,
Brian.

2888
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:14,700
So you think you're going to die.
Okay.

2889
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:16,790
You look like shit.
It's getting worse.

2890
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:18,410
Is it?
I don't know if it's just because I have

2891
02:05:18,411 --> 02:05:19,250
an aide in 20.

2892
02:05:19,420 --> 02:05:20,830
You haven't eaten in a long time,
man.

2893
02:05:21,490 --> 02:05:26,490
There's a low energy show and that's why
this guy won $500 and got a new flat 

2894
02:05:28,421 --> 02:05:30,250
screen TV.
Well congratulations.

2895
02:05:30,251 --> 02:05:31,450
Quit now.
And you're way ahead.

2896
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:33,040
That's a good move.
Taxes,

2897
02:05:33,041 --> 02:05:34,030
taxes.
Taxes,

2898
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:39,420
yeah,
but here's the problem with the idea of 

2899
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:39,420
taxes,
taxes,

2900
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:39,420
taxes,
when it comes to poker,

2901
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:41,770
just made people pay taxes just like 
strippers have to pay taxes.

2902
02:05:41,980 --> 02:05:43,840
They're not always right.
You know what I mean?

2903
02:05:43,841 --> 02:05:48,841
You know,
you just make people fucking make them 

2904
02:05:48,841 --> 02:05:49,360
accountable.
You know,

2905
02:05:49,420 --> 02:05:51,760
if you really want me,
the whole tax situations,

2906
02:05:51,940 --> 02:05:55,330
pretty disgusting as it is,
especially if you're in a 48 percent tax

2907
02:05:55,331 --> 02:05:55,780
bracket.
Look,

2908
02:05:55,781 --> 02:05:57,370
a lot of people are.
It's gross.

2909
02:05:57,400 --> 02:05:58,900
The government should never get half of 
your money.

2910
02:05:58,901 --> 02:06:01,480
That's fucking completely ridiculous.
You make 100 bucks,

2911
02:06:01,481 --> 02:06:03,880
they get 50 or 48 bucks.
That's stupid.

2912
02:06:04,090 --> 02:06:09,090
That doesn't make any God damn sense and
you've got to protect yourself and set 

2913
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:11,050
up a bunch of different shit so that.
So that they only take a small slice out

2914
02:06:11,051 --> 02:06:12,070
of your pie,
you know,

2915
02:06:12,071 --> 02:06:17,071
you gotta move to Nevada or you know,
open a corporation or do a bunch of 

2916
02:06:17,071 --> 02:06:21,181
different stupid things so that you can 
have a less money out there that they 

2917
02:06:21,181 --> 02:06:21,580
get to steal from,
you know,

2918
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:21,750
or

2919
02:06:21,770 --> 02:06:26,770
are you just taking an ass like me and 
just give them all the money that you 

2920
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:27,690
got audited?
You got audited like a motherfucker what

2921
02:06:27,691 --> 02:06:32,691
happened son to make a video.
But the irs and it's sexy is gonna.

2922
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:37,760
They're gonna audit me again this year.
What you did it because you use one of 

2923
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:40,050
those programs and you tried to take a 
lot of different things on turbo tax and

2924
02:06:40,051 --> 02:06:43,800
then I used a home office and Blah Blah 
Blah.

2925
02:06:43,890 --> 02:06:47,100
And they just don't like it when you 
have a Home Office.

2926
02:06:47,101 --> 02:06:49,620
I guess they don't like it when you have
a lot of exemptions.

2927
02:06:49,621 --> 02:06:51,450
Is that what it is?
Well I would like right off,

2928
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:52,350
like,
you know,

2929
02:06:52,590 --> 02:06:55,700
like electricity right off,
like gas and you know,

2930
02:06:55,740 --> 02:06:58,470
driving because it's a home office and 
stuff like that,

2931
02:06:58,471 --> 02:07:03,471
you know,
or whenever I buy batteries and stupid 

2932
02:07:03,471 --> 02:07:03,471
stuff like that.
But uh,

2933
02:07:03,471 --> 02:07:05,100
I thought Mike because I buy everything 
online.

2934
02:07:05,130 --> 02:07:10,130
So what I was thinking is like,
Oh I have receipts for everything 

2935
02:07:10,130 --> 02:07:10,130
because I use credit cards and I buy 
online.

2936
02:07:10,130 --> 02:07:13,620
Well Visa and mastercard and all these 
guys decided to hey,

2937
02:07:13,621 --> 02:07:17,490
we're not going to save all your stuff.
We're only saved the last year.

2938
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:20,250
So they changed it where it used to be 
like you'd have,

2939
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:25,280
you could go back back.
I was able to go back like three years 

2940
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:25,470
and check out my statements like three 
years ago,

2941
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:27,390
but they stopped it.
So now it's only one year.

2942
02:07:27,391 --> 02:07:31,440
So I just lost like all my receipts.
So then when they never kept anything in

2943
02:07:31,441 --> 02:07:32,910
hard for them,
everything was online.

2944
02:07:32,911 --> 02:07:34,350
Yeah.
So I got kind of got fucked by that.

2945
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:35,980
I wonder if they did.
They're

2946
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,380
in cahoots.
That's what I'm saying.

2947
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:41,110
What if the IRS tax rates contacts?
Mastercard says,

2948
02:07:41,111 --> 02:07:42,810
listen,
you don't have to keep that shit right.

2949
02:07:43,090 --> 02:07:44,470
Twelve years,
12 months,

2950
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:45,490
that's enough.
Dude.

2951
02:07:45,990 --> 02:07:47,950
You don't have the whole shit for 10,
12 years.

2952
02:07:47,951 --> 02:07:49,480
Fuck them.
They should have.

2953
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:51,490
They should have files.
It's not your responsibility.

2954
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:53,080
I agree.
She's not ours.

2955
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:55,630
I mean we were just providing the 
service and yeah man,

2956
02:07:55,631 --> 02:07:56,830
fuck them.
Fuck the records.

2957
02:07:56,831 --> 02:07:58,750
Burnich hit.
What are they running out of?

2958
02:07:58,751 --> 02:08:00,350
Hard drive space over at Bank of 
America.

2959
02:08:00,351 --> 02:08:01,240
I thought,
that's ridiculous.

2960
02:08:01,530 --> 02:08:05,470
Twelve kilobyte file.
You can't the fuck you fucking in bed.

2961
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:12,020
The irs in itself is supposedly illegal.
All these wacky people that don't think 

2962
02:08:12,101 --> 02:08:16,090
you should pay taxes.
What are the fuck does the money go?

2963
02:08:16,091 --> 02:08:18,040
That's the crazy thing.
When you really look at taxes,

2964
02:08:18,041 --> 02:08:19,390
there's no,
there's no receipt.

2965
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:21,220
It's not like,
hey Mr Johnson,

2966
02:08:21,221 --> 02:08:26,221
you spent $30,000
in taxes this year and this is what we 

2967
02:08:26,221 --> 02:08:26,221
did with your money.

2968
02:08:26,221 --> 02:08:30,600
We spent x amount on your local middle 
school and x amount on this and you 

2969
02:08:31,781 --> 02:08:33,250
know,
x amount went to that.

2970
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,870
No,
you don't get a fucking receipt.

2971
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:36,760
They're not accountable.
That's the problem.

2972
02:08:36,910 --> 02:08:39,700
That's why when you hear about like 
crazy no bid,

2973
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:44,840
you know,
contracts and you know that they're in 

2974
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:47,611
bed with these fucking Halliburton and 
all these different companies that are 

2975
02:08:47,611 --> 02:08:51,900
getting these crazy fucking contracts.
Then in money winds up missing and it's 

2976
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:54,240
like well they can't account for 
billions of dollars and it's.

2977
02:08:54,370 --> 02:08:59,370
This is mad cluster fuck of money and a 
big grab like who is stealing when it 

2978
02:09:00,281 --> 02:09:03,400
comes to this bank thing,
this whole bank bailout thing.

2979
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:06,880
When you look at the money and they talk
about $700,

2980
02:09:06,881 --> 02:09:11,881
billion dollars and all this money 
flying left and right and people still 

2981
02:09:11,881 --> 02:09:13,160
getting bonuses and is there,
is it really a.

2982
02:09:13,190 --> 02:09:15,220
They have an accounting system for all 
this.

2983
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:20,440
I mean,
can we really tell like where your tax 

2984
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:20,440
dollars went to this bailout and how it 
was used?

2985
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:23,320
They don't even have to fucking tell.
You don't even have to tell you,

2986
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:26,920
but yet if you file a tax report,
motherfucker,

2987
02:09:26,921 --> 02:09:31,921
you better have receipts for everything.
You better have receipts for every God 

2988
02:09:31,921 --> 02:09:33,610
damn thing you want an exemption for.
But when you ask them like,

2989
02:09:33,611 --> 02:09:35,350
what did you do with all my tax dollars?
What you,

2990
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:35,630
you,
you,

2991
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:38,350
you used it to get these bankers.
Wait a minute.

2992
02:09:38,351 --> 02:09:40,960
These bankers set it up.
Do you know that they were shorting that

2993
02:09:40,961 --> 02:09:43,510
we're making sure that they were 
protected on both ends.

2994
02:09:43,660 --> 02:09:48,660
There were selling clients a certain 
stock and then gambling that that stock 

2995
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:52,411
was going to fail.
You should probably not talk about the 

2996
02:09:52,411 --> 02:09:52,411
irs.
I should probably be quite right.

2997
02:09:52,690 --> 02:09:57,690
It's amazing.
Duncan trussell to gave me the best 

2998
02:09:57,690 --> 02:09:57,690
advice.

2999
02:09:57,690 --> 02:10:00,370
Don't talk about the look of it is.
I'm talking about the whole system,

3000
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:01,540
man,
man,

3001
02:10:01,570 --> 02:10:02,890
man,
man.

3002
02:10:03,310 --> 02:10:08,310
It's just,
it's incredible that it's set up that 

3003
02:10:08,310 --> 02:10:08,590
way and that politicians don't do a 
goddamn thing to change it.

3004
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:13,740
Obama was swearing before he got into 
office that he was going to end no bid 

3005
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:16,570
contracts and it just gave the former 
company known as Halliburton.

3006
02:10:16,571 --> 02:10:18,160
I guess they changed their name to 
something else,

3007
02:10:18,161 --> 02:10:20,470
but he just gave them some $500,
million dollar.

3008
02:10:20,471 --> 02:10:22,330
No bid deal.
Exactly what he said.

3009
02:10:22,331 --> 02:10:27,331
He wouldn't do that motherfucker run two
hours and 10 minutes Joe.

3010
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:34,440
Well,
that's what Brian is saying that his 

3011
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:36,280
vaginas hurting.
It was buttholes bleeding and he's 

3012
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:36,280
tired.
Man.

3013
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:36,280
Everybody's saying,
wake up.

3014
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:38,890
People saying wake up or advantage at 
that time.

3015
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:43,130
Make up people are sad.
Fifty percent goes to the military.

3016
02:10:43,131 --> 02:10:44,660
Does it really?
Who the fuck knows?

3017
02:10:44,661 --> 02:10:49,661
Does anybody know when the actual 
numbers are of money going into the 

3018
02:10:49,661 --> 02:10:49,661
military?
All right,

3019
02:10:49,661 --> 02:10:50,570
let's take a couple of questions.
We go to the board,

3020
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:52,580
see if anybody has anything interesting 
to say.

3021
02:10:55,150 --> 02:10:57,130
And uh,
this is a trial and Hoodie,

3022
02:10:57,131 --> 02:11:00,850
by the way isn't mean the movie tron.
Look at you.

3023
02:11:02,020 --> 02:11:04,000
You really are a fucking Nerd,
Huh?

3024
02:11:04,510 --> 02:11:06,400
You're for real.
So a lot of dudes.

3025
02:11:06,401 --> 02:11:08,840
Fake nerdom,
right?

3026
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:16,030
Stone Cold,
Steve Austin and Bruce Buffer.

3027
02:11:16,031 --> 02:11:18,220
We're unsure dog radio today.
Oh,

3028
02:11:18,970 --> 02:11:21,400
good times.
Good Times,

3029
02:11:21,401 --> 02:11:26,401
Ladies and gentlemen.
I think we went through the entire 

3030
02:11:26,401 --> 02:11:28,651
broadcast without me saying bananas.
I said I tried to say like as little as 

3031
02:11:28,651 --> 02:11:30,670
possible as well because like,
that's annoying.

3032
02:11:30,820 --> 02:11:32,050
Like man,

3033
02:11:34,790 --> 02:11:35,570
uh,

3034
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:41,180
um,
is the feed usually choppy?

3035
02:11:41,210 --> 02:11:43,850
How many people on this stupid thing?
A thousand people.

3036
02:11:44,270 --> 02:11:45,980
That's all we ever get.
That's where we're good for her,

3037
02:11:45,981 --> 02:11:48,080
good for a thousand people.
Other than that,

3038
02:11:48,290 --> 02:11:51,330
people are going to bail out eventually.
I think these guys are just stirring.

3039
02:11:51,331 --> 02:11:53,780
You have anything planned?
They're just reading questions now.

3040
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:59,170
It's been going on for two hours.
This guy says,

3041
02:12:00,970 --> 02:12:02,600
oh,
he's quoting me twice in my life.

3042
02:12:02,601 --> 02:12:07,601
I've developed blisters on my Dick from 
jacking it and my suspicions are 

3043
02:12:07,601 --> 02:12:07,601
confirmed.
There are others.

3044
02:12:08,590 --> 02:12:09,890
What does that mean?
Other suspicions?

3045
02:12:10,810 --> 02:12:11,420
Just trying to say

3046
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:17,130
what do I think that e-cigarettes,
I think that chemical they use for the 

3047
02:12:17,130 --> 02:12:20,191
smoke dries out your throat and causes 
your throat to get fucked up so it 

3048
02:12:20,191 --> 02:12:20,191
doesn't.
Yeah.

3049
02:12:20,191 --> 02:12:22,570
I mean I was spitting up blood from 
using e-cigarettes,

3050
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:24,100
so.
But that's you dude.

3051
02:12:26,500 --> 02:12:29,710
If you google it,
the chemical that they use for it is the

3052
02:12:29,711 --> 02:12:33,160
same shit they use in a.
it's an FDA approved chemical bites used

3053
02:12:33,270 --> 02:12:38,270
to make fog in nightclubs and one of the
things that does is dries out your 

3054
02:12:38,270 --> 02:12:42,931
throat and my shit started getting 
jacked up and now spitting blood and I 

3055
02:12:42,931 --> 02:12:42,931
was like,
fuck this.

3056
02:12:42,931 --> 02:12:44,950
I'd rather smoke a cigarette.
Then this nonsense.

3057
02:12:45,340 --> 02:12:46,180
Really?
Yeah.

3058
02:12:46,181 --> 02:12:47,740
So I don't know,
so they're not good,

3059
02:12:47,741 --> 02:12:52,741
but don't they?
They help you quit because they just 

3060
02:12:52,741 --> 02:12:55,990
fucking get patched.
That's helped me quit one day,

3061
02:12:55,991 --> 02:12:56,980
two days and I'm good.

3062
02:12:58,040 --> 02:13:03,040
Two days is all it took.
Now you were smoking for awhile before 

3063
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:03,040
this new girlfriend.
You have the old,

3064
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:05,400
the old girlfriend?
No,

3065
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:09,230
I don't mean about your situation.
I mean she smoked,

3066
02:13:09,231 --> 02:13:09,410
right?

3067
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:14,500
Yeah.
Now I live with somebody that doesn't 

3068
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:14,720
smoke so it's easier.
But yeah,

3069
02:13:14,721 --> 02:13:17,930
when you live with somebody that smokes,
it's impossible to stop smoking when the

3070
02:13:17,931 --> 02:13:18,920
other person's smoking.

3071
02:13:19,490 --> 02:13:20,420
Yeah,
I can imagine.

3072
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:21,310
You know,
if uh,

3073
02:13:21,470 --> 02:13:26,470
I get addicted to certain things.
Like for Awhile I was addicted to clean 

3074
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:27,170
out my ears at q tips.
I fucking love.

3075
02:13:27,171 --> 02:13:30,000
It feels so good.
You get in there and sardines,

3076
02:13:30,110 --> 02:13:31,770
sardines I was but wasn't really 
addicted.

3077
02:13:31,771 --> 02:13:33,210
Sardines.
But the q tips,

3078
02:13:33,211 --> 02:13:38,211
man,
it's hard for me to walk by a box of q 

3079
02:13:38,211 --> 02:13:38,211
tips and not want to stick one of my 
year,

3080
02:13:38,211 --> 02:13:38,880
you know.
But if you live with someone and they're

3081
02:13:38,881 --> 02:13:42,490
all cleaning their ear,
making moaning noises like that,

3082
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:44,100
it makes it even harder.
You know,

3083
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:49,370
like I'm trying not to fucking my doctor
told me not to be sticking shit in my 

3084
02:13:49,370 --> 02:13:49,370
ear.
I'm trying to do the right thing and you

3085
02:13:49,370 --> 02:13:54,330
overhear digging into your ear and Moan 
and one time for real though,

3086
02:13:55,110 --> 02:13:59,220
I did put two q tips in my ear at the 
same time and I took a shit.

3087
02:14:00,010 --> 02:14:02,670
It was the best feeling ever.
I was one of the best feelings ever.

3088
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:08,080
My,
my ex had one in her ear and she 

3089
02:14:08,080 --> 02:14:11,420
answered the phone and she went,
oh my God,

3090
02:14:11,450 --> 02:14:15,190
you tip shoved into her ear and a peer 
stir here drowning.

3091
02:14:15,770 --> 02:14:16,740
Well,
she's retarded.

3092
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:19,410
That's a dumb thing to do,
but yeah,

3093
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:21,540
I could feel it.
That's painful.

3094
02:14:22,530 --> 02:14:24,600
Puncturing your eardrum.
I've heard of dudes getting your eardrum

3095
02:14:24,601 --> 02:14:29,601
punctured and fights a ruptured from 
getting head kicked or punched in the 

3096
02:14:29,601 --> 02:14:29,680
head,
punching the ear.

3097
02:14:30,340 --> 02:14:35,340
Your ear ruptures and then you can't 
hear your ear and it's got to heal up 

3098
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:35,610
and sometimes they have to do surgery on
people's ears.

3099
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:38,730
Guys have like an ear problems from 
Jujitsu to like that.

3100
02:14:38,731 --> 02:14:43,731
A cauliflower ear BARF.
Sometimes it actually goes the bleeding 

3101
02:14:43,731 --> 02:14:47,310
and the swelling goes inside the ear and
the insight ear can get infected.

3102
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:51,950
Do Dave Terrell guy fought for the UFC 
for awhile and um,

3103
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:55,020
he's a very,
very accomplished grappler.

3104
02:14:55,080 --> 02:15:00,080
He's had some serious problems with his 
ears where he's actually had to get his 

3105
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:03,201
ears cut off of his head.
They actually had it like peel his ears 

3106
02:15:03,201 --> 02:15:04,080
back,
fix whatever the fuck was in it,

3107
02:15:04,081 --> 02:15:06,630
and then sew them back on his head.
Wow.

3108
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:13,640
Yo,
that things like that make me not want 

3109
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:17,361
to stick a q tip of my ear,
but I couldn't imagine if I had a 

3110
02:15:17,361 --> 02:15:20,871
cigarette thing,
if I had a cigarette thing and I was 

3111
02:15:20,871 --> 02:15:20,871
living with someone who's smoking all 
the time,

3112
02:15:20,871 --> 02:15:24,770
especially when they're stressed out and
they fucking fire that cigarette up and 

3113
02:15:25,410 --> 02:15:27,600
you see the relaxation come across their
face.

3114
02:15:27,601 --> 02:15:28,710
I've seen it with you,
dude.

3115
02:15:29,010 --> 02:15:33,540
I've seen you talking about.
I've seen that.

3116
02:15:33,541 --> 02:15:35,730
Look on your face many times where 
you've been freaking out.

3117
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Simon's been driving you crazy and you 
got it sounds delicious right now.

3118
02:15:45,160 --> 02:15:48,840
And I see the relaxation.
Just the calmness wash over you.

3119
02:15:49,590 --> 02:15:54,590
What an evil trick,
and you know what the Communists 

3120
02:15:54,590 --> 02:15:56,961
actually is.
It's actually just satisfying that 

3121
02:15:56,961 --> 02:15:57,840
monkey on your back.
That's really all it is.

3122
02:15:58,050 --> 02:16:03,050
It's not like cigarettes make you calm.
It's that the lack of cigarettes makes 

3123
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:07,311
you tense.
And when you get that cigarette in your 

3124
02:16:07,311 --> 02:16:07,311
system,
then you become calm.

3125
02:16:07,311 --> 02:16:09,500
Like what a terrible trick.
Like it's so goddamn addictive.

3126
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:14,540
We're not talking about something that's
so addictive you have to do at once a 

3127
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:14,540
week,
you know,

3128
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:14,540
that's addictive.
You know,

3129
02:16:14,540 --> 02:16:18,830
some people are addicted to certain 
things and they have to do them like 

3130
02:16:18,830 --> 02:16:18,830
once a day.
We're talking about every 15,

3131
02:16:18,830 --> 02:16:20,400
20 fucking minutes,
man.

3132
02:16:21,720 --> 02:16:23,280
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

3133
02:16:23,281 --> 02:16:26,570
It's like twirling your hair.
It's nuts that it's so popular.

3134
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:28,560
And how many people in America smoked 
cigarettes?

3135
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:34,620
Like 40.
It's a big fucking number and not a 

3136
02:16:34,661 --> 02:16:35,020
single

3137
02:16:35,300 --> 02:16:40,300
fishing.
Never says that God damn thing about 

3138
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:40,300
stopping it.
Whatever.

3139
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:41,260
Do what you gotta do.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3140
02:16:41,410 --> 02:16:41,920
that's my,

3141
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,310
that's my advice to you next gig.
Um,

3142
02:16:45,360 --> 02:16:47,760
I don't have anything coming up to be 
honest with you.

3143
02:16:47,761 --> 02:16:50,670
In America.
My next gigs are um,

3144
02:16:50,940 --> 02:16:55,940
June 17th and Saskatoon Canada,
June 18th at Grand Prairie,

3145
02:16:57,931 --> 02:17:02,931
Alberta and June 19th in Winnipeg.
So those are,

3146
02:17:03,691 --> 02:17:05,730
those are my next comedy gigs.
And then the next one,

3147
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:09,240
the next big one in America is a.
well in June,

3148
02:17:09,241 --> 02:17:10,200
I'm at the,
um,

3149
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:15,480
the Improv in Irvine,
but Brian doesn't have that up on my 

3150
02:17:15,480 --> 02:17:16,550
calendar.
That's on the eastern counters.

3151
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:19,380
Not been until fucking ustream calendar 
updated son,

3152
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:22,050
but that's a,
towards the end of June.

3153
02:17:22,110 --> 02:17:25,470
I'm at the Irvine Improv.
I don't remember.

3154
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:26,940
20 something,
something something.

3155
02:17:27,270 --> 02:17:29,100
And then July second,
um,

3156
02:17:29,130 --> 02:17:30,680
at the,
um,

3157
02:17:31,290 --> 02:17:36,290
house of Blues in Las Vegas,
if you want to find out the actual full 

3158
02:17:36,290 --> 02:17:36,450
schedule,
you can go to Joe Rogan.net

3159
02:17:36,451 --> 02:17:39,390
and get it there.
They found a hole in space.

3160
02:17:39,391 --> 02:17:41,220
This guy says,
what are you talking about,

3161
02:17:41,221 --> 02:17:41,550
son?

3162
02:17:42,030 --> 02:17:44,130
You can't just say things like that in 
capital letters.

3163
02:17:44,131 --> 02:17:48,420
They found a hole in space.
Do you mean a floating vagina?

3164
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:51,090
What do you mean?
Is it a monster?

3165
02:17:51,091 --> 02:17:53,400
Butthole?
Why do you need to wear headsets?

3166
02:17:53,790 --> 02:17:54,270
Why?
Why?

3167
02:17:54,300 --> 02:17:56,070
Why do you care?
Why do you care for were headset,

3168
02:17:56,100 --> 02:17:57,060
sir?
What's wrong with you?

3169
02:17:57,360 --> 02:18:01,580
What is this whole in space or can I 
Google hole in space and will you,

3170
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:06,700
will you be vindicated or will it be 
some fucking snopes debunked article 

3171
02:18:09,330 --> 02:18:10,950
where there really isn't a hole in 
space,

3172
02:18:11,010 --> 02:18:15,090
huge hole found in the universe?
Well,

3173
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:16,680
these things take awhile to get to this 
guy.

3174
02:18:18,450 --> 02:18:23,450
Maybe he's in Ohio.
The universe has a huge hole in it that 

3175
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:24,930
dwarfs everything.
Anything else of its kind.

3176
02:18:24,931 --> 02:18:26,970
The discovery caught astronomers by 
surprise.

3177
02:18:26,971 --> 02:18:30,390
The whole is nearly a billion light 
years across.

3178
02:18:30,630 --> 02:18:35,630
It's not a black hole,
which is small sphere of densely packed 

3179
02:18:35,630 --> 02:18:35,630
matter rather.

3180
02:18:35,730 --> 02:18:36,570
Well,
fuck that old news.

3181
02:18:36,571 --> 02:18:39,180
Look at that.
What San Diego,

3182
02:18:39,210 --> 02:18:44,210
huge earthquake.
Just hit really that maybe a five point 

3183
02:18:44,210 --> 02:18:44,330
something.
It looks like that's not huge.

3184
02:18:44,331 --> 02:18:45,390
Faggot.
Five point.

3185
02:18:45,690 --> 02:18:47,720
That's nothing.
That's the cow.

3186
02:18:47,890 --> 02:18:49,920
Is that California Nevada fault line?
Yeah,

3187
02:18:49,921 --> 02:18:51,720
exactly.
Where I was telling you last time.

3188
02:18:51,721 --> 02:18:53,790
How is your million?
Look at all these earthquakes,

3189
02:18:53,791 --> 02:18:56,520
so don't move to San Diego.
San Diego.

3190
02:18:56,550 --> 02:18:57,660
Oh,
that is pretty nutty.

3191
02:18:58,320 --> 02:19:00,240
They say the Pacific northwest is due 
to.

3192
02:19:00,270 --> 02:19:02,330
They were talking about that in some.

3193
02:19:02,790 --> 02:19:06,630
I read about Oregon that Oregon's due 
for another fucking gigantic blast.

3194
02:19:06,631 --> 02:19:08,590
Anyway,
there's a fucking hole in the universe.

3195
02:19:09,030 --> 02:19:11,100
The universe is populated with visible 
stars,

3196
02:19:11,101 --> 02:19:16,101
gas and dust,
but most of the matter in the universe 

3197
02:19:16,101 --> 02:19:18,891
is invisible.
Scientists know something is there 

3198
02:19:18,891 --> 02:19:21,200
because they can measure the 
gravitational effects of the so called 

3199
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:21,210
dark matter.
Voids exists,

3200
02:19:21,270 --> 02:19:23,640
but they're typically relatively small.
Well,

3201
02:19:23,641 --> 02:19:28,641
this fucking voice,
this Gargantuan whole was by examining 

3202
02:19:28,641 --> 02:19:31,280
observations made by using the very 
large array,

3203
02:19:31,281 --> 02:19:36,281
the Vla telescope in Chile,
funded by the National Science 

3204
02:19:36,281 --> 02:19:36,281
Foundation.
Yeah,

3205
02:19:36,281 --> 02:19:37,790
there's,
there's some shit out there folks.

3206
02:19:37,791 --> 02:19:42,650
There's so much more shit out there than
we have mapped out and understand.

3207
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:45,230
It's,
it's one of the reasons why we tune into

3208
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:50,980
Fox News.
It's one of the reasons why we're 

3209
02:19:50,980 --> 02:19:51,710
fascinated by who tiger woods is fucking
because the universe itself is too scary

3210
02:19:51,711 --> 02:19:55,100
and too much of a gigantic reminder that
we ain't shit.

3211
02:19:55,730 --> 02:19:57,290
And with that note,
ladies and gentlemen,

3212
02:19:57,320 --> 02:19:59,150
thank you very much for tuning into the 
podcast,

3213
02:19:59,151 --> 02:20:02,510
the fleshlight.com.
Go there and buy something and fuck it.

3214
02:20:02,580 --> 02:20:07,580
It's,
it's way better than your hand and I 

3215
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:07,580
don't think it's that expensive.
How much are those things like 69,

3216
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:08,690
79 bucks?
Is that really all it is?

3217
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:14,200
It's worth it.
Thinking about how much money you spend 

3218
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:14,810
on dates with girls that you don't like,
hoping that you could fuck them when you

3219
02:20:14,811 --> 02:20:18,830
could save that and use that flashlight 
over and over and over again.

3220
02:20:18,831 --> 02:20:21,470
It's people who go to clean it.
It's really not that hard.

3221
02:20:21,471 --> 02:20:21,860
Now.
I know.

3222
02:20:21,861 --> 02:20:24,040
You just hook it up to the,
put up to the faucet,

3223
02:20:24,041 --> 02:20:26,660
turned the faucet on your squirts out,
squirts out the back.

3224
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:28,310
It's no problem.
It's not hard at all.

3225
02:20:28,311 --> 02:20:32,410
And then you get like a little squeegee 
in there and ram it.

3226
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:34,820
And how's the book coming?
The book is coming.

3227
02:20:34,821 --> 02:20:35,610
Good.
Um,

3228
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:36,290
it's,
it's,

3229
02:20:36,291 --> 02:20:37,340
uh,
it's doing very well.

3230
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:39,310
It's um,
uh,

3231
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:43,130
it's weird and it's taken a long time.
Its takes a long time to write,

3232
02:20:43,131 --> 02:20:48,131
to actually write something out.
It would have been probably way easier 

3233
02:20:48,131 --> 02:20:48,470
if I tried to transcribe it and just 
talk,

3234
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:53,740
but you know,
use like maybe a dictation program or 

3235
02:20:53,740 --> 02:20:53,740
something like that.
But I don't think it'll be as good.

3236
02:20:53,740 --> 02:20:55,970
I think it's better to the.
It's a slow process to write things out.

3237
02:20:55,971 --> 02:21:00,971
But when you do just write things out,
you're forced to edit them and you're 

3238
02:21:00,971 --> 02:21:00,971
forced to like go over them again and 
see the.

3239
02:21:00,971 --> 02:21:03,410
Like the poetry of the,
of each sentence.

3240
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:05,600
It's much,
much better for reading.

3241
02:21:05,601 --> 02:21:08,840
I think if you actually write it out,
if you actually just talk it,

3242
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:10,200
sometimes you're,
you know,

3243
02:21:10,201 --> 02:21:10,790
you're going to.

3244
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:13,730
It's not going to be as smooth as if 
you've reviewed it.

3245
02:21:15,160 --> 02:21:17,870
It won't be done.
Its due in October.

3246
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:22,900
That's when it's due.
It takes a long time to these fucking 

3247
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:22,900
things a lot longer than I thought.
Blogs are easy,

3248
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:24,350
you know,
I blog put a blog up the most,

3249
02:21:24,351 --> 02:21:26,330
it's like 2000 words.
That's a giant one,

3250
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:28,430
you know,
and that takes like six or seven hours,

3251
02:21:28,431 --> 02:21:31,340
but it doesn't matter because no one's 
paying me to do it.

3252
02:21:31,341 --> 02:21:32,870
So it's like I try,
I do my best,

3253
02:21:32,871 --> 02:21:34,550
I do what I think it is and I throw it 
up there.

3254
02:21:34,551 --> 02:21:35,510
Whereas,
like this,

3255
02:21:35,511 --> 02:21:37,790
I'm trying to put more attention and 
focus to.

3256
02:21:38,300 --> 02:21:39,380
So,
uh,

3257
02:21:39,830 --> 02:21:41,000
that's it,
you know,

3258
02:21:41,001 --> 02:21:42,110
my twitter,
it's Joe Rogan,

3259
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:43,490
you know,
my um,

3260
02:21:43,550 --> 02:21:45,080
website,
Joe Rogan.net.

3261
02:21:45,410 --> 02:21:50,410
And uh,
I told you about the upcoming dates in 

3262
02:21:50,410 --> 02:21:53,261
June in Canada and in the Irvine Improv.
And then July second in Las Vegas at the

3263
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:59,200
House of Blues will be a fucking party.
Looks like Sam Tripoli is doing that 

3264
02:21:59,200 --> 02:21:59,540
with me.
It shouldn't be fucking crazy.

3265
02:21:59,660 --> 02:22:00,770
Sam Tripoli,
if you've never seen him.

3266
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:02,690
Home areas.
Very funny guy.

3267
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:04,460
Shout out to medic Hershey.

3268
02:22:04,490 --> 02:22:06,470
