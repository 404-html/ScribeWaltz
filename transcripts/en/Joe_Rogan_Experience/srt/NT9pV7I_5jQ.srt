1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
what the Fuck's going on?

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,470
So this up.
I'm sorry for the late start.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,560
We were all fucked up.
We had a,

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,420
we weren't all fucked up,
but the cam is all fucked up.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,860
That a problem with the Webcam,
but we're is high right now and I'm back

6
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:28,620
from Abu motherfucking dobby son.
That was very strange.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,820
Scary at all.
It's scary.

8
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:32,090
It scared me,
man.

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,050
I mean it's A.
I mean it's real safe and it's real 

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,610
western over there.
But the bottom line is that place is the

11
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:45,560
first time when we were done the first 
time he muted the live preview.

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,050
Yeah.
So we don't hear ourselves.

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,330
But um,
we uh,

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,850
we got over there and it's very strange.
First of all,

15
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:58,760
we're at a place called Yas Island,
which is a manmade island.

16
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,920
They said,
which means they built an island.

17
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,100
Isn't it sinking?
Is that the one that's the one in Dubai,

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,030
the ones you buy the sinking is the one.
They have a model of the world.

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,890
If you ever wanted to know how much 
money is an oil,

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,780
right,
you gotta go to the Middle East.

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,930
I'm sure that it's fucking staggering.
Really.

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,150
I didn't see a shitty car while I was 
there.

23
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,890
Everything was a fucking Mercedes.

24
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,920
It's a Mercedes or A.
I guess the cabs are kind of crappy,

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,220
but it's all for robberies and 
lamborghinis and these fucking 

26
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,610
buildings.
They built this island.

27
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:36,611
Okay.
And then they have this thing called 

28
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:36,611
Ferrari world and that's where the UFC 
was,

29
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:37,760
which is this crazy theme park.
They're building.

30
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,520
They're just building shit constantly.
Everywhere you go.

31
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:41,720
They're building,
you know,

32
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:44,780
like all throughout the city of Abu 
Dhabi.

33
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:49,430
It's all just skyscrapers and cranes and
shit going on constantly.

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,780
Apparently Dubai's buys even crazier.
I didn't want to fuck around with Dubai 

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,040
dough.
I didn't even want to fly in there.

36
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,890
One of them,
one of the options was we could fly into

37
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:02,891
Dubai and then from Dubai we would take 
a car service that would take us a 

38
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,750
dress.
It's like an hour and a half drive to an

39
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,560
island and I was like,
I don't want to land in Dubai,

40
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:08,900
man.

41
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,390
I can't keep hearing crazy shit about 
Dubai.

42
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,710
I hear crazy shit about people who got 
arrested because there was some sort of 

43
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,330
a visa problem,
so they drug test them.

44
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,500
They arrested this one woman for coding.
She is.

45
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,530
She lives in the UK.
She has a prescription for codeine 

46
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:25,530
because she's got a back problem,
got back injuries.

47
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,790
So they arrested her for this and put 
her in fucking jail because she had it 

48
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,280
in her system.
Wow.

49
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,550
There's another guy who was traveling 
there who had a speck of marijuana on 

50
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,910
the bottom of his shoe.
But if you look at the dude,

51
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:41,720
that dude was like a roster.
He had dreadlocks and shit and that does

52
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:46,721
not fly.
Did you vacuum out your suitcase on my 

53
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:49,610
God that I didn't smoke pot for a whole 
day to day.

54
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,210
Crazy.
That was out of my head.

55
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,190
Yeah,
that's shit.

56
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,190
Just that shit scares me.
There's no reason to be put into that 

57
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,290
because I've heard too many horror.
It's not a regular society.

58
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,350
I mean it's run by kings and you know,
for the most part they're running just 

59
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,820
like western democracy means most,
you know,

60
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,620
it's very clean and very safe and cops 
are everywhere and people are polite.

61
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,010
But the bottom line is you don't have 
the same sort of rights you have in 

62
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,010
America,
you know,

63
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,280
we always want to talk about are 
dwindling rights and our rights are 

64
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,271
certainly dwindling,
but they're still way better than what 

65
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:24,760
you'd get over in Dubai.
Dubai,

66
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:27,280
you don't get shit it a couple of weeks 
maybe out on the piece.

67
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,980
Now they're in jail.
That's where we're making out.

68
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:30,660
And then they,
they,

69
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,280
they said you can't do that.
We're going to put you in jail.

70
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,410
So they don't have a problem with like,
you know,

71
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:37,050
like the ring card girl is wearing.

72
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,120
I was wondering because I didn't talk to
anybody before,

73
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,020
I'm like,
what am I going to wear?

74
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,960
This chick's gonna wear like dresses.
Like how weird would that be if they had

75
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,960
a world like that would've been awesome.
Yeah.

76
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,690
They gave me the dress thing,
the,

77
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,890
the traditional garb,
and there was a guy who does my job for 

78
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,370
the Arab world.
Very nice guy.

79
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,840
Uh,
his name was Muhammad and the,

80
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,650
they call them husband and they call 
them Muhammad Rogan and uh,

81
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,080
it's hilarious.
And he,

82
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,520
he does the whole outfit and when he 
does his broadcast,

83
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:09,190
he does this traditional Arab where they
all were.

84
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,390
It's like a white outfit with like a 
black thing around your head and then a 

85
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,280
white headdress,
I don't know what's called but everyone.

86
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:18,590
Whereas there did it smell okay over 
there dude,

87
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,840
it's a bunch of rich people with crazy 
money and weird outfits,

88
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,300
you know?

89
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,860
And I kind of liked the outfit for 
certain.

90
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,400
This is what I liked about the outfit.
I like it because like you can't,

91
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,190
I mean I guess you could wear like a big
watch or something like that.

92
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:38,191
But like stylistically everyone looks 
the same and there's something about 

93
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:39,640
that.
Something about that is dumb.

94
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,310
It's like you should be able to dress 
and look however you want,

95
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,000
but something about that is kind of cool
because it's like,

96
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,460
is it really fucking important what you 
wear?

97
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:50,230
It's not,
it's like it's in your head,

98
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:54,520
it's nonsense and all this style and 
like how you want to be portrayed.

99
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:59,170
Like have you ever seen a dude who like 
wants to be thought of as like a writer,

100
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,350
you know,
wants to be thought of as like an 

101
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,701
intellectual.
She's wearing like a jacket with the 

102
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:05,770
Elbow Jack.
Carol whack.

103
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,680
Yeah.
Or that.

104
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,810
It's like just a certain amount of like 
pretense that comes with what you were,

105
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,460
you know,
that's unavoidable.

106
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,250
You know,
I dress like I'm fucking 20 years old.

107
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:18,730
I mean I'm 42 fucking years old.
I still dress exactly the same.

108
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:21,970
I did when I was 20.
If you look at my wardrobe when I was 20

109
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:24,090
and now the only difference is I have 
more clothes now.

110
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,900
That's it.
And I have a lot of tap out shit.

111
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,860
But other than that it's I fucking 
dressing same.

112
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,490
I,
I,

113
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:34,150
there's something about wearing that 
outfit that they're all in unity to.

114
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,790
It's like they all recognized like we're
all in this together,

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,300
like we all have the same outfit on.
I mean part of it is like,

116
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,570
it's got to be bad for like creativity 
and individuality and stuff like that 

117
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,130
because one of the reasons why people in
America are so creative is [inaudible].

118
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,320
If you want to,
you could put a lip ring in and fucking 

119
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,010
shave half your head and paint the other
half purple and Tattoo your face.

120
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:59,011
You can do whatever the fuck you want 
over here and something about that as 

121
00:05:59,011 --> 00:05:59,011
good for creativity

122
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:01,130
to the point I understand,
but also I've had jobs where I've had to

123
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:06,131
have a uniform and was so much better 
having a uniform or wearing the same as 

124
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:10,241
everybody else instead of having to like
pick out a different tie every day and 

125
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:11,210
every day for work.

126
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,390
Yeah,
that is true,

127
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,200
but if you had to choose when you're 
working between having a uniform and not

128
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,850
having a uniform,
you're always going to say no.

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,570
No,
I don't know.

130
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:23,571
That's what I was saying.
I think I like having a uniform at work 

131
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:23,571
because then kids,
you have to dress up,

132
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,960
right?
What if you could drag a real job,

133
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:28,440
and I'm talking about real world,
real world in the real world.

134
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,730
We live in a fake.

135
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,950
It's not a no.
That is another thing though about the 

136
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,221
world is that the world is so.
It's so God damn rigid and what you're 

137
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:41,841
supposed to wear and high supposed to 
behave and how you're supposed to dress 

138
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:42,930
like Jesus fucking Christ.
Like what?

139
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:47,931
That's the best way they have of 
controlling people really is to make 

140
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:51,981
sure that you're always going to wear 
suits and ties when you go to work and 

141
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:54,581
that you know,
you can't get into this place because 

142
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:54,581
you have a hat on and you know,

143
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,690
I hate the hat on thing.
So silly that.

144
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,790
I mean because I could understand where 
like you're in some parts where you're 

145
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,790
like,
oh,

146
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,611
that guys might get mad at the other guy
because they're in a different gang or 

147
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:04,210
something.
Or Gotham.

148
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,050
Take your hat off.
Yeah.

149
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,670
They wanted me to take off my hat and I 
was with you at a comedy

150
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,970
club and he works for me.
It was ridiculous.

151
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,870
It was,
um,

152
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,610
we were,
uh,

153
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,540
at um,
what,

154
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,180
where the fuck was it?
Well,

155
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,210
that's the most ridiculous one.
Strip clubs or another ridiculous thing 

156
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:24,210
that happens too.
If you go to a strip club,

157
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,451
they tell you to take your hat off now.
What did they tell you to turn it 

158
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:28,451
around?
That's my other favorite.

159
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:28,830
If you were in it like I'm wearing 
sometimes.

160
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:30,370
So can you please turn your head around 
sir?

161
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,380
Yeah.
Because like,

162
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,640
oh,
now you got me now.

163
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,440
Normal.
One of the funniest things ever.

164
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,460
This is 100 percent true story.
My ex fiance and me went to a bar once 

165
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,980
and they,
we drove all the way to oxnard or 

166
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,140
something like that and we get there as 
a friend's birthday and they're like,

167
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:46,490
sorry sir,
you can't come in.

168
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:49,400
You don't have a collar on your shirt.
And I'm wearing a tee shirt.

169
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:49,980
I'm like,
what?

170
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,270
We drove an hour and a half to get here 
for a friend's birthday.

171
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:58,271
And you say I can't come in and it was 
like all the stores around it were 

172
00:07:58,271 --> 00:07:58,271
closed because it was ochsner at nine at
9:00

173
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:03,100
PM.
So I went to my car to try to find a 

174
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,901
shirt and only thing could find is my ex
fiance shirt and it was like a small 

175
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,270
little tiny collared shirt that he wore 
for work.

176
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,330
Right.
So I was like fat man putting on this 

177
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,261
shirt.
It wouldn't even fit it look like that 

178
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:16,261
old Chris Farley like fat man in the 
jacket thing.

179
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:20,780
Like I couldn't button it up and it had 
a color this and I put the collar up and

180
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:22,940
I seriously walked up to the door like 
this and I'm like,

181
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:24,740
hi color shirt.
Can I come in?

182
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:25,360
And you're like,
yeah,

183
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:30,361
I guess so.
They let me in wearing just a great tee 

184
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:34,631
shirts.
I now look like a fucking freak walking 

185
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:34,631
around the Bargo Hey,
can I get a bug light and stuff.

186
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,010
Lead is the collared shirt story.
Like

187
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,840
what?
What the fuck is that about?

188
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,080
Why?
Why is it collar boat and no color?

189
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,040
I don't know.
Especially,

190
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,500
wouldn't you just be like,
alright,

191
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,530
you know what,
just take off that.

192
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,690
Just go in.
So ridiculous.

193
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,640
The thing about,
uh,

194
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,930
the Middle East is that you don't have 
to wear that outfit.

195
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,150
When they gave me the head dress,
they gave me one.

196
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:54,200
When I got there I was like,
okay,

197
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,460
am I going to do I wear this when I'm 
here?

198
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:59,220
Like that would be hilarious if we did 
it like that.

199
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:01,530
Me and Mike both work,
but no,

200
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,040
nobody had to wear it but you know,
it people were and some people don't,

201
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,020
but a lot of people do when you go to 
the mall.

202
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:10,380
So like I'd say like 30 or 40 percent of
the people were wearing it.

203
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,760
Wow.
It's weird.

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So like,
do they look down on people that don't 

205
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
wear it?

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Like I don't know.
I do get more trouble if you wear normal

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,700
clothes.
I want,

208
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:19,350
that's a good question.
Yeah,

209
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,160
maybe.
Right.

210
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:23,340
Or maybe getting more triple where that 
shit because you're right.

211
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,360
Fuck up the whole scene.
Right?

212
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,840
Blow on the curve,
man.

213
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,910
I think it'd be great because they would
feel like you're wearing pajamas 

214
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,910
everywhere,
just be naked underneath it.

215
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,220
It's probably something to do with the 
heat,

216
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,230
you know,
because it's a really light thing and it

217
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,390
doesn't stick to you and it,
you know.

218
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,540
I don't know.
I guess they're probably naked under it 

219
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:41,540
if you want them to.
Yeah,

220
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,170
if you want it to be naked under that,
that actually pretty dope.

221
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,260
Yeah,
probably perfect for that kind of 

222
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,960
weather flapping around ball sweat,
hitting your shoe to it.

223
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,590
It's hot as fuck over there and I don't 
even think we're in the summer,

224
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,950
but there's first of all the billions of
mosquitoes there.

225
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,670
We got lucky and we didn't get hit,
but they said you can get,

226
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,710
you can get fucked up like a swarm of 
them like swarm on you and you'll get 

227
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,941
like a thousand bikes all over you.
There was wasps that were flying around 

228
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,451
the cage at that big.
I was freaking out because it makes you 

229
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:11,451
realize like,
oh yeah,

230
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:13,590
like we're in the fucking Middle East.
You know what I'm saying?

231
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,560
We're like east of Africa,
you know?

232
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:18,940
Whoa.
DC camels and shit everywhere.

233
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,050
I didn't see camels,
but some guys went and rode on camels 

234
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,111
and shit.
Next sex and the city takes place there 

235
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:27,111
at my life.
Really?

236
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:28,990
Yeah.
Those dirty bitches to ground over that.

237
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,680
It gets Dick.
Apparently.

238
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:34,610
There's a tremendous amount of hookers 
and Dubai,

239
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:39,650
Dubai's like hooker central.
It's like there's hundreds and hundreds 

240
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,900
and hundreds of hookers.
So you go into like bars and clubs,

241
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:45,600
they don't have clubs and the clubs are 
attached to a hotel.

242
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,020
So you go in the club,
it's attached to a hotel and just you 

243
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,930
get,
just get swarmed by Russian hookers.

244
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Wow.
Because there's so many rich dudes over 

245
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,411
there and that's what it's all about.
It's about rich students do in business 

246
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,700
and they feed off them and suck their 
cock and milk money out of them.

247
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,020
Wow.
And you know,

248
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:09,050
get some cash.
Were at the comedy store the other day 

249
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,451
and it's really hot.
Chick was all over my friend Jason and 

250
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:12,540
the team and everyone was like,
damn,

251
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,860
he likes,
she likes him,

252
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:15,450
Blah Blah Blah.
And then finally like,

253
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:20,451
and he's like,
groping her and stuff and he must have 

254
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:20,820
said something to her because at the end
she goes,

255
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,560
you have to pay to play.
And he goes,

256
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:24,360
what?
And then he doesn't know what.

257
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:25,410
And then she gets all right,
nevermind.

258
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,440
And walks away.
And then this is like a half hour of 

259
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,070
presale that she did to him and no one 
saw it coming.

260
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,600
It was like,
wow,

261
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:34,440
this,
this is cool.

262
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,060
How much money?
I don't know.

263
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,250
I don't think he,
I think he just went what?

264
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,200
I cannot afford cigarettes.
But they are you talking about?

265
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,960
Yeah,
there's a lot of that over in the Middle

266
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,860
East though.
That shits.

267
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,400
It runs rampant.
Makes Sense.

268
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,980
So many dudes with money,
you know,

269
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,730
they have the biggest building in the 
world is Dubai.

270
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,860
It's a half a mile high.
Is that the one that the

271
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,860
golf thing.

272
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,530
Oh,
that's another one I think.

273
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,560
I don't think that's the same one,
but there is one with a tennis tennis 

274
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,530
courts architecture out there.
It's just an amazing.

275
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,550
Off the chain.
Yeah.

276
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,640
They have so much money.
They have more money than you could 

277
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,341
possibly imagine,
but apparently it's all dried up 

278
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:14,460
apparently.
It's crazy now that so many people owe 

279
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,000
money over there and if you get,
if you go broke over there,

280
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,830
you don't go to court and file for 
bankruptcy,

281
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:20,290
you know,
you go to fucking jail,

282
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,440
they put your ass in a cage.
They put you in what's called debtors' 

283
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:25,900
prison.
And debtors prison is a,

284
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,900
something you really want to avoid.
So when people are going into the hole,

285
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,020
they just drive their fucking four hours
to the airport and gone.

286
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,110
Wow.
So there's Ferrari's abandoned at the 

287
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,031
airport,
like day people are constantly 

288
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:39,580
abandoned.
The luxury cars leaving their houses,

289
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,100
you know,
they show up to,

290
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,450
to collect money and there's no one 
there and they're gone.

291
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:46,300
They moved to Africa,
so it's been good,

292
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:46,990
nutty,
bad.

293
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,700
But uh,
they have nobody.

294
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:53,701
Shit like a indoor ski facility.
Like you can go skiing and doors.

295
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:55,200
That's about,
as I've seen this before,

296
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,890
apparently it's,
you have to see to believe how big it.

297
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,320
Right,
right.

298
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,790
It's actually like a,
there's a picture of it.

299
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,820
We could probably,
somebody could probably Google it where 

300
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,711
it's just like a huge,
like slope and it's like a diamond all 

301
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:07,711
the way down.
It's crazy.

302
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,720
Go surfing indoors to somewhere there.
What'd you do?

303
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,740
I still don't personally.
Yeah.

304
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,280
Um,
yeah.

305
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:20,281
So anyway,
so that was what the Middle East was 

306
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:20,281
like.
It was.

307
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:21,070
People were very friendly over there.
Food was fantastic.

308
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,740
You know,
the hotels,

309
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,520
top notch.
It was only,

310
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,760
well I guess there were some people that
were there that weren't there for the 

311
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:29,760
fights,
but not,

312
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:29,760
it wasn't crowded.

313
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,190
What's illegal?
Alcohol.

314
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:31,800
Illegal out there.

315
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,140
Alcohol,
you don't,

316
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:36,470
you can't go to bars but they have bars 
at your hotel,

317
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,680
but that's the only place they have bars
is in hotels.

318
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,260
I think that's the law.
You cannot have a bar,

319
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,160
but you can have a bar inside of a hotel
for I guess for Westerners,

320
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,960
but they have like,
you know,

321
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,240
regular.
The food was great,

322
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,690
the beer was great.
It's like a regular.

323
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:51,770
Yeah,

324
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,250
everything tastes okay.
Like it tastes like Cola and everything

325
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,260
as Arab riding on it.
That's weird.

326
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:03,110
He's taken some of that for what could 
doing for your scrap book,

327
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,130
what are you talking about?
What are you 12?

328
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,080
So that the arena was outside though,
right?

329
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:11,510
There was no risk to that.
I didn't even,

330
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,340
it was,
was outside.

331
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,500
And that was an interesting part of it 
too,

332
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,180
because the first fight,
uh,

333
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,670
was uh,
John.

334
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,270
God dammit,
I forgot his last name.

335
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,620
He fought for the ultimate fighter 
anyway,

336
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:30,400
and Mustapha Al Turk and uh,
the first fight,

337
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:35,401
these guys were so fucking slippery.
They were punching and as they were 

338
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:39,721
punching sweat was flying off them 
because they were the first guys to 

339
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:41,500
fight.
And so they were fighting like basically

340
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:46,501
in the sunlight and it was know fucking 
a hundred degrees outside and humid and 

341
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:48,700
that,
that had to affect their fight for sure.

342
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:50,020
Yeah.
They pace themselves,

343
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:51,470
you know,
and then they got through it.

344
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:51,980
But,
uh,

345
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,200
John Madsen,
thank you very much sir.

346
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,050
Um,
and the John Madsen,

347
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:02,051
Mustapha Turk was a fight and they were 
so sweaty and every time they threw 

348
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:02,990
punch,
sweat was fucking flying off.

349
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:06,720
And literally like they threw water,
like they were throwing cups of water at

350
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:06,930
each other.

351
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,800
It was fucking crazy.
So that's the.

352
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,900
So that's the reason why the guy who 
fought Silva went into lay down the 

353
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:13,900
whole time.
No,

354
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,820
I just sat there and I got to talk about
that.

355
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,240
That's a very controversial fight.
I,

356
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,300
I,
I rewatched the fights last night.

357
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,330
I rewatched a Bj Penn,
Frankie Edgar,

358
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,570
and I rewatched a Anderson Silva and I'm
Damien Maia and the Frankie Penn,

359
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,790
Bj,
the Frankie Edgar,

360
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,550
Bj Penn.
A lot of controversy on that fight.

361
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,760
One of them is [inaudible] doug crosby,
who's A judge who's a friend of mine.

362
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:42,260
I like him.
He scored it 45 to 50,

363
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:44,780
meaning he gave every single round to 
frankie edgar.

364
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,230
Now I thought it was way closer than his
way closer than that.

365
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,870
I watched the game last night in person.
I was like,

366
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:52,010
man,
I don't know.

367
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,420
When I saw it in person,
I was like,

368
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:55,490
look,
the kid did fantastic.

369
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:57,830
He definitely did better than anybody 
expected.

370
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,130
Um,
but the thing is when you're doing 

371
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,821
commentary for fights,
basically I'm just kind of explaining 

372
00:16:06,821 --> 00:16:08,270
what's happening,
I'm sure to keep an italian my head,

373
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,470
but what I'm concentrating on most is 
explaining things,

374
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,420
being entertaining,
you know,

375
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:15,740
trying to,
you know,

376
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,690
trying to do good commentary.
Not really scoring is done silently,

377
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,890
you know?
Correct.

378
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:25,310
Scoring is done silently because you're 
contemplating what's,

379
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,290
what's more valuable.
I mean it's,

380
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,570
a lot of it is subjective,
but you have to contemplate,

381
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,730
okay,
a guy throws a punch and the guy,

382
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,700
the other guy counters with a leg kick.
Which one was harder?

383
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,960
Which one?
You know what I'm saying?

384
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:40,961
It's like,
who do you give it to with some people 

385
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:43,331
give the punch to it,
some people will give the leg kick and 

386
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:43,340
in that case I could see how it would be
closer,

387
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,880
you know,
then then I thought it was when I 

388
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:48,880
watched it last night,
but when I watched the last night,

389
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,520
I thought it was three rounds to two for
bj penn.

390
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,930
That's what I thought.
I mean,

391
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,940
I,
I think there's been clOser ones before 

392
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:58,940
I,
I,

393
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,900
to me,
I could have taken either way,

394
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,960
either way.
It wasn't ridiculous to me that he won,

395
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,800
but 45 to 50 was ridiculous and the 
reason why I say it wasn't as ridiculous

396
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:09,830
because like when I was calculating when
I was watching it,

397
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:14,831
like in the first round,
he lands a really nice leg kick at one 

398
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:17,951
point and then bj hits him with a punch 
and bj hit him with a couple of other 

399
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:21,281
punches during the take downs and he had
pj with a few punches and one of them 

400
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:22,670
cut him.
So that probably affected people because

401
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:24,560
bj had like a little mark under his 
face.

402
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,660
So sometimes judges look at that and I 
go,

403
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:31,661
yeah,
he got the best of that round just 

404
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:31,661
because a little cut sometimes that 
affects them.

405
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:33,830
So you know,
it's so subjective man.

406
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,860
But then the second run I was like,
bj's landed more punches.

407
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:41,861
They're like lending more,
frankie's throwing more and he's moving 

408
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:41,861
more.
He's making bjj fighters fight.

409
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:46,840
He's definitely making bj chaser.
So you're going to take that into 

410
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:46,840
account.
Who's,

411
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,260
who's doing better there?
Who's got better ring generalship or 

412
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,450
control the octagon while bj's,
the one forcing the fight.

413
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:56,451
He's chasing after him,
but frankie is really avoiding too much 

414
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,481
damage,
but I think the cleaner shots were 

415
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:00,270
landed by bj and then as it got into the
later rounds,

416
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:05,271
dennett seemed like frankie,
the only round that was really clear to 

417
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:08,151
me,
it was the fourth or the fifth round 

418
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:08,151
rather.
The fifth round was clear.

419
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:08,460
That was all edgar.
He took him down.

420
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,460
He landed some real good shots.
It was a good round.

421
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:15,240
It seemed like around for him where 
where bj was fading every other round,

422
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:16,830
but the fifth was like,
man,

423
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,150
who fucking knows?

424
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Well,
it's kind of like if you see a fight at 

425
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,621
a cafeteria,
you're not talking about the first five 

426
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:26,841
minutes of a fight.
You're talking about what that the end 

427
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:27,330
of the fight is dominating.
And that's a very good point.

428
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:28,860
That's a very good point.
And you know what?

429
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:31,260
A lot of people feel like fights should 
be scored that way,

430
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,960
that they're different than,
than any other sport.

431
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,110
And at the end really is what matters 
because they'd been imposing their will 

432
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,190
on each other and here's the end result.
The end result of 25 minutes of imposing

433
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:44,100
their wills with frankie edgar was 
kicking bj's ass,

434
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,740
set them down.
He led,

435
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,790
kicked him.
He was moving better.

436
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,730
You know,
he,

437
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:49,710
he in the end,
you know,

438
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,350
bj chased after him with a very few 
final seconds,

439
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,390
but he knew that it was the final 
seconds.

440
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,420
I would love to hear bj's,
not the type of guy to make excuses 

441
00:18:59,420 --> 00:18:59,420
other people.

442
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,980
That's true.
Vaseline.

443
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,020
Well,
but that might've been true though.

444
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,980
Let's be honest.
It was true.

445
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,270
They rub it on the guy's face and you 
see,

446
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,230
rub it on the guy's chest and rubbed it 
on the guys back.

447
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,640
Just kidding.
I know that's 100 percent illegal.

448
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:16,530
And I love phil nurse.
I think he's a great coach.

449
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,410
I love gsp.
Those to both of them.

450
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:24,411
But you can't do that.
I believe when they say that this 

451
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:27,531
fucking witch Dr.
Guy tells them to do this thing because 

452
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:28,050
he explained it to me.
He explained to me this weekend,

453
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,590
it seems like total malarkey.
It's like,

454
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:36,591
you know,
he's telling me that there's three 

455
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:36,591
minds.
There's a mine here,

456
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:36,591
mine here in a mind here,
and there's pressure,

457
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:39,540
builds up the chain and you have to 
release and you grab here and you press.

458
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,480
You know why that works?
It works if you believe it works.

459
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,940
That's why that works and there's a lot 
of shit like that.

460
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:49,941
Like I know a dude who's a chiropractor 
slash healer and a lot of people swear 

461
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:55,470
by them and the reason why they swear by
them is because if you believe that what

462
00:19:55,471 --> 00:20:00,471
he's doing is going to heal you.
Your body has amazing ability to heal 

463
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:03,711
itself.
Negative and positive thinking and 

464
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,710
negative and positive beliefs about your
life are without a doubt,

465
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,940
self fulfilling prophecies.
You can decide that your life is awesome

466
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,670
and your life becomes awesome.
Now if you decide that your life sucks,

467
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,870
you can decide that your healing and 
your heel,

468
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,980
you can decide that you're not in pain 
and you won't be in pain and you can 

469
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,041
make pain happen,
especially when it comes to like back 

470
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,891
shit and you know there's real injuries 
and people get in car accidents and 

471
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:24,891
fucking jujitsu.

472
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,050
You get your neck cranked.
But there's also people that create back

473
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:33,051
injuries to avoid their life,
like they don't want to think about 

474
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:33,051
reality.
So ah,

475
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:36,840
my fucking back.
And that keeps them from thinking about 

476
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:36,840
other shit.
But anyway,

477
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,940
that's why they do this thing where you 
press ahead and that's what that's all 

478
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,160
about.
It's like some psychosomatic thing,

479
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,360
but it's a placebo if,
if,

480
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,710
if you believe in it,
man,

481
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,490
it fucking works.
So I would like anyone.

482
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:51,491
I would like to talk to bj and find out 
how was he in shape because he didn't 

483
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:54,100
look as good as it usually looks.
I mean he didn't look fat,

484
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,540
but he didn't look as hard as he looked 
in the sanchez find the sessions feisty.

485
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,120
He looked sculpted and this fight he had
a little bit of a belly,

486
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:06,150
like a little bit of fat on his way,
so maybe he had an injury because he 

487
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,630
also didn't sit down and his stool in 
between rounds,

488
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:12,631
which I thought was unusual.
Was it him that had the thing you had a 

489
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:14,610
nice sleeve on and he didn't sit down in
between rounds and which you rounds.

490
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:19,611
He stood up and he put his leg up,
put his leg up on the stool and they 

491
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:19,720
said that to him at one point in time.
Bj,

492
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:20,950
put your leg up,
put your leg up.

493
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,530
There you go.
But I don't know what that means.

494
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,540
It could be a cramp.
It could be nothing.

495
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,610
It could be.

496
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,710
It's that human and you just got done 
fighting.

497
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:30,000
You're going to want to sit down and he 
can.

498
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,490
Yeah,
I would think so.

499
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,320
I would think so.
I don't know what it is,

500
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,840
but see he hasn't said a word about it,
so I don't know.

501
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,080
So I think I could easily see how 
someone could give that fight to frankie

502
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:43,130
edgar.
It totally makes sense to me.

503
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,400
You know,
and I said like when I saw it live I was

504
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:47,720
like man,
I don't know either way,

505
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,080
but at the end of the fight edgar was 
winning the fight and like you said,

506
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,410
that should count more.
That's the way pride scores that the way

507
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,200
to do it.
They counted the fight as like one whole

508
00:21:57,201 --> 00:21:58,490
thing.
That's how it should be.

509
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,280
Totally.
I totally agree with you.

510
00:22:01,281 --> 00:22:06,281
I think.
I think fights are not like any other 

511
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:09,041
sport and that like there was a fight 
between rio shown and a brad blackburn 

512
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:13,541
once and brad blackburn was kicking his 
ass for two rounds and then the third 

513
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:18,950
and final round real children came on 
strong and he battered black is beat the

514
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:19,790
fuck out of them.

515
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,980
Like really went after him and broke his
nose and he had him running from him.

516
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,870
Total domination.
The third route.

517
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:31,871
So it was so much difference between the
first two rounds which are pretty close 

518
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:35,201
but blackburn was winning by,
was getting his shots in but jonah and 

519
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:38,461
keep coming forward.
But blackburn was kicking his ass but 

520
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:39,380
then the third real China just turned it
on.

521
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,700
But real lost the fight,
he lost a decision because blackburn one

522
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,000
the first two rounds and I said that's 
the first.

523
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,040
See the clearest example to me of how 
someone won the fight but lost the fight

524
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,620
at the same time.
He wanted a decision,

525
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,800
but he lost the fight.
If it was a fight.

526
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,850
That guy lost the fight.

527
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:03,930
Yeah.
What's crazy about imagine two guys 

528
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:03,930
fighting and at the last second it got 
hits.

529
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,040
A guy knocks him out right when the bell
hits,

530
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:11,090
you know.
But in the other guy won because he was 

531
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,090
doing the rest of the fight better,
you know?

532
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,090
But if,
you know what I mean?

533
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,380
Like what if that were to happen,
what if that knocks him out?

534
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:13,770
He goes,
no,

535
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,170
no,
no.

536
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:16,390
Right at the bell though,
like thing bam.

537
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,910
Guy knocks out,
you know the.

538
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:18,100
Yep.

539
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,350
Oh,
like after the break.

540
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:24,351
Right.
You know why you would say to the guy 

541
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:24,351
dropped his guard because he heard the 
bill.

542
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,890
No,
no.

543
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,350
If it was like full from that bank 
thing,

544
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,220
bonk,
you know,

545
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,740
like

546
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,920
I think as long as he was already 
committed to the punch before the bell 

547
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:33,920
rang,
right,

548
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,100
it wouldn't be a problem.
But you know,

549
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:37,770
that would like some crazy last second 
buzzer shit.

550
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,630
Right.
Because it.

551
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,690
Because liotta.
But cheetah did that.

552
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,810
He'd knocked out thiago silva at the,
like after barbara and he put them out.

553
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,780
It was like during the horn,
I think going off or,

554
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,310
or very close.
Very close within.

555
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,590
Why don't.
So has there been any talk about taking 

556
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,590
the pride rules?
No,

557
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,640
no,
no.

558
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,520
What?
It's so hard to,

559
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:06,540
uh,
to reason with the people that are 

560
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:06,600
involved and just sanctioning.
It's so hard to get things sanctioned.

561
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,370
And the thing I've said before,
people complained about elbows like this

562
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,440
elbow,
which is what they call the 12 to six 

563
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,440
elbow coming straight,
straight down.

564
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,630
The only reason why that was made 
illegal was because big John Mccarthy,

565
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:22,530
this came straight from his mouth when 
he was educating the commission and they

566
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:23,570
were trying to,
you know,

567
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,840
legislate mixed martial arts.
The people in these athletic commissions

568
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,170
were worried that downward elbows on 
espn at 2:00

569
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:33,270
in the morning can break bricks,
you know,

570
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,970
there's fucking karate demonstration.
So they were like,

571
00:24:35,971 --> 00:24:38,820
well we can't have that because you can 
hit someone and killed them.

572
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,470
Okay,
so you can't do that,

573
00:24:40,471 --> 00:24:43,020
but you can still do this,
which is more powerful.

574
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,530
I think this is less powerful than this.

575
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,320
This right here.
It seems to get more weight into it.

576
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:53,100
It's a more natural motion.
This is pretty strong,

577
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:58,101
but I don't think it's as good as this.
It's like hitting someone in the head 

578
00:24:58,101 --> 00:24:58,860
like that is not as strong as hitting 
them a lot.

579
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,890
That was like when you turn your body 
into something,

580
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,240
you have more power and I think that 
makes more sense that this elbow,

581
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,810
the elbow that jon jones broke brand and
various eye socket with.

582
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,310
That's the.
That elbow.

583
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:14,790
That's illegal elbow,
but it's powerful as fuck.

584
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:17,190
Like what?
Why is the other one illegal?

585
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:18,480
And this one's legal debts.

586
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,680
I kind of get it though because there is
a big reason why the ufc used to be on 

587
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,350
an a vhs tape with faces of death in my.
In my collection.

588
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,720
That used to be shocking,
like almost disturbing,

589
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,100
like,
oh,

590
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:32,750
I don't want to watch because it was 
like this guy could die,

591
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,360
you know?

592
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,480
No,
I definitely agree that there should be 

593
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:38,480
rules and I definitely agree this should
be sanctioning,

594
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,260
but it should be rational shit.
It should be.

595
00:25:40,261 --> 00:25:42,840
I don't think you should.
Soccer kick people in the ground,

596
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:43,510
right?
I don't.

597
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,520
I don't think,
but I do think that if a guy's on his 

598
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,781
back,
he should be able to kick you in the 

599
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:50,781
face.
Right?

600
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:53,360
If you're on your knees so loud,
you should still be able to kick you in 

601
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:53,360
the face.
You're punching him in the face.

602
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,660
Why can't he kick you?
That's ridiculous.

603
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,050
If you are one nay,
you can blast someone in the face with a

604
00:25:58,051 --> 00:26:00,360
punch.
Why can't he kick you in the face?

605
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,920
You're trying to hit him.
Well,

606
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:02,970
you can't move as good.
Well,

607
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:05,070
don't be there then.
That's ridiculous.

608
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,220
You're taking away a a,
an important weapon for the guy in the 

609
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,220
bottom.

610
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,700
You should be able to up kick the fuck 
out of someone when they're on their 

611
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:13,700
knees.
If that guy's trying to punch you in the

612
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,171
face and you're lying on your back,
it's like your weight is on top of them 

613
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:19,650
like you're stomping him.
You're kicking from your back at him.

614
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,890
You should be able to kick his fucking 
head like a soccer ball when you're 

615
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,410
lying on your back and a guy's on his 
knees,

616
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:30,411
on top of you trying to punch you,
you should be able to kick the fuck out 

617
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:33,090
of him and it should be much more.
Put yourself in much more jeopardy.

618
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,160
You're in much more danger when you're 
on top of a guy then,

619
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,310
and that's how it should be because 
that's how it is in real life.

620
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,900
That's how it should be.
It shouldn't be this unrealistic thing 

621
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,680
where the guy has to be standing up over
you for you to kick in the face.

622
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,910
No,
it should be.

623
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,310
You could kick them as long as you're on
the bottom.

624
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,430
Is there the bottom you can kick them 
and if you're on the top you can kick 

625
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:52,430
everything except for his head and 
that's what it is.

626
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,630
You can kick a guy in the body when he's
on the ground,

627
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,400
you know you can kick the guy in the 
legs,

628
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:01,550
you can kick it down to opponent.
So a downed opponents should be able to 

629
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,280
kick you anywhere from any,
anywhere.

630
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:03,210
Who wants?
It's legal.

631
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,160
There's a lot of rules.
I need to be changed though.

632
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:10,161
Like gracie's never tap.
Come on that last fight.

633
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,420
That fight that he wasn't going to tap 
that.

634
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,310
That's one of those fights though that I
was like this.

635
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,130
All right,
there should be a cut.

636
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,220
Alright.
Fights over because there were so many 

637
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,220
times where I'm like,
why is this guy even bother?

638
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,940
Let's finish with the frankie edgar.
Fight that fight though because I think 

639
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,010
like I said,
scoring is a very subjective thing.

640
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:34,190
You could say the frankie edgar 
outworked him because he threw more 

641
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,370
punches and he landed leg kicks.
He didn't learn that many leg kicks.

642
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:36,930
Frankie definitely landed more leg 
kicks.

643
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,480
He mixed it up more.
Take down attempts so I could definitely

644
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:43,440
see him winning the fight.
I could see it being an argument because

645
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,620
no one can say that.
Their opinion when something's that 

646
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,321
close,
you can't really say that your opinions 

647
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:52,110
right or wrong,
but the fifth round he won.

648
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,690
He won the fifth round.
I don't see how anybody could argue that

649
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:55,900
he didn't.
But doug,

650
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,060
this crosby men 50 to 45 minutes.
That's ridiculous.

651
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,160
That doesn't make any sense.
He must've been drunk.

652
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,240
That's why the reference should be done 
by a 100 people.

653
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,500
Yes.
I think you're right.

654
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:10,380
I think three is too little and you know
another here's another problem.

655
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:15,530
Maybe the referee and should be done in 
some sort of an online thing where 

656
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,940
people they get picked.
Absolutely no,

657
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,770
like they get picked the the like 
posters on message boards.

658
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:21,930
Guys who are big fans,
guys who really,

659
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:23,880
really understand the sport and we do it
electronically.

660
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,690
What's the.
What's the thing that's a measures,

661
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,460
a tv ratings and stuff and get a nielsen
box.

662
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,850
Something like that.
Pick only a certain amount.

663
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:36,990
I don't think it should be like millions
of people means like that though.

664
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,330
Your paper idea,
but you know what the problem is,

665
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:41,190
they all have to be there live to 
really.

666
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,800
Then there's that too.
There's that argument.

667
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:46,200
There's that live is actually not as 
good.

668
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,320
Oh,
you're not seeing the whole thing.

669
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:52,350
Not seeing the whole angles and you 
don't get to see a monitors.

670
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,240
You know,
like when you live.

671
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:59,241
Like when I'm doing commentary,
I've got two monitors to my to my right 

672
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:00,510
and one to my left.
So there's,

673
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,540
there's all sorts of angles.
Like sometimes we're looking at a fight 

674
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,920
and we're watching it live through the 
cage and write some shit goes down,

675
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:13,070
they'll move in front of a barrier or 
they're moving in front of one of the 

676
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:16,670
polls and I can't see shit for a second 
and then I have to turn to the monitor 

677
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,580
or they're on the ground and from the 
angle where I'm at,

678
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:20,310
all I see is one the side of a person's 
body,

679
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:25,311
like they're on the ground,
but they're on the other side of the 

680
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:25,311
octagon.
I can't say it.

681
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:25,470
So I have to look to the monitor,
the judges don't get that,

682
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,500
they don't get monitors.
So these guys are just watching the 

683
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,660
fight as it's happening from the angle 
that they get and ever.

684
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,050
And you know,
I argued with the fucking,

685
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:36,210
the athletic commission guy about it and
he's like,

686
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:37,020
well,
you know,

687
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:37,880
um,
the,

688
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,690
this is the,
you know,

689
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,620
that's why we have three judges.
So they all have different angles.

690
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,230
No,

691
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,190
because you're going to get shitty 
handles,

692
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,740
give them fucking monitors that they 
should have it like,

693
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:55,770
er style,
where the doctors are all above looking 

694
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,370
down at the fight.
And we are absolutely.

695
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,860
But the problem is even if above you,
what you would really have to do is be 

696
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,690
in there and we can't have that now 
above with a monitor.

697
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,880
The cameras are better.
Really watching it,

698
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,280
watching it live is better for the 
excitement.

699
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:11,530
Like there's nothing that beats that 
excitement.

700
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,170
It's fucking nuts.
You know,

701
00:30:13,171 --> 00:30:15,610
and when you're there and you know,
fucking,

702
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:20,670
you know,
randy coture is stepping in to fight 

703
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,520
brock lesnar and the place is going 
bananas.

704
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:22,330
You know,
that's,

705
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,630
that's pretty intense.
You know that you can't recreate that at

706
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:26,470
home,
at home.

707
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:29,590
It's fun,
but when you're there live,

708
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,160
you feel like you're a part of history,
like you feel like you're a part of some

709
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,480
wild ass shit.

710
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,660
You know when shogun and machita fight 
in montreal in may,

711
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:42,810
that being in that arena,
when those two guys step in there for 

712
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,571
the rematch,
that's going to be everyone in the 

713
00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:45,571
fucking place is going to have 
goosebumps.

714
00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:45,910
That's going to be nuts,
man,

715
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,500
because they're going to know this is 
history,

716
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:52,501
man.
These guys went at it for five fucking 

717
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:55,200
rounds.
Everybody thought machida was totally 

718
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,091
untouchable and then most people thought
shogun one of the decision and now 

719
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:59,380
they're going out again and live and 
it's happening right now.

720
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:01,080
Here we go.
Watch it at home.

721
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:02,320
It's pretty dope.
You know,

722
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,240
you get the commentary,
you get the replays,

723
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:04,940
you get,
you know,

724
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,960
get all the information,
but watching it live to some special 

725
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
crackle in the air or your front row in 
the middle.

726
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,470
Most of the time when I watched live,
I watched the monitors,

727
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,190
like I watch it while they're standing 
up,

728
00:31:15,191 --> 00:31:19,650
but once it's down I'm looking at the 
monitor and the floor.

729
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,300
You're like right there and I'm only 
like a couple rows,

730
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,520
you know,
but still I'm watching the monitor being

731
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:29,521
right there.
It's pretty dope to be able to look 

732
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:31,471
through the cage.
It's almost worth keeping that ufc job 

733
00:31:31,471 --> 00:31:34,171
just for that.
Do you ever get like blood splat right 

734
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:34,570
on your hit this weekend?
Oh,

735
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,580
you hit on my arm.
One of the prelims is licking out of it.

736
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:41,590
I told him,
give us a hot water,

737
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,980
get in my dna.
It was a um,

738
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,180
it was pretty intense.
Yeah,

739
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,470
there was a,
there was a lot of,

740
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,560
there was a lot of blood and a couple of
fights.

741
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,390
The,
that was in the um,

742
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,220
uh,
Paul Kelley.

743
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,010
Matt veech fight.
Matt beach had a horrible cut.

744
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:01,310
He had a couple of them and just 
splattered they were right in front of 

745
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,050
us and they're beating on each other and
just the blood went flying.

746
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,910
So that's my take on the controversy on 
the frankie edgar,

747
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:11,240
bj penn fight.
I think frankie edgar,

748
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,660
frankie edgar flawed a hell of a fight.
It was a tremendous performance.

749
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:17,850
So super impressed with them.
Um,

750
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,960
but uh,
I'm not exactly sure if I agree with the

751
00:32:21,961 --> 00:32:24,120
verdict.
I definitely don't agree with 50 45,

752
00:32:24,121 --> 00:32:27,720
but I thought it was a very close fight 
and obviously I'm not a judge so who the

753
00:32:27,721 --> 00:32:32,721
fuck am I to judge?
And I definitely could see an argument 

754
00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:32,721
for frankie winning it.

755
00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:33,240
And like I said,
he put on a tremendous fight.

756
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,690
I mean really impressive and definitely 
one the last round.

757
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,290
So if you look at it in terms of like we
said,

758
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,130
you know,
someone that's the way it should be that

759
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,160
though the guy winds at last round wins 
the fight.

760
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,750
I mean he's the,
they've,

761
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:49,810
they've,
they've imposed their will upon each 

762
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,761
other and you know,
the end result is after all this time 

763
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,990
this guy's dominating the other guy,
but cafeteria rules.

764
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:59,050
Then there's another school of thought 
where you have to take the champions 

765
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,570
title,
which I don't really agree with.

766
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:03,470
I think the decision should be clear,
but I think you go in neutral.

767
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,050
I think when a guy's a champion,
you go in neutral,

768
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,670
you know,
you're both go in neutral.

769
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:08,910
And if the champion,
you know,

770
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,730
if you win the decision,
you're the new champion.

771
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,530
If he wins the decision,
he's a new champion.

772
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,020
It doesn't have to be some crazy 
domination,

773
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,670
you know,
because that's what leads to like shitty

774
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:19,370
decisions where a guy really does beat 
the champion,

775
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:21,890
but he only agism and then he never gets
the.

776
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:26,891
You never get.
Those are frustrating as fuck because 

777
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:26,891
you think he did it.
I think he did it.

778
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:28,910
The other problem with the frankie edgar
fight,

779
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,780
this was,
uh,

780
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:33,640
an interesting point is that when you're
watching a guy who you think is going to

781
00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:35,480
get his ass kicked,
right,

782
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:40,550
a lot of people did.
A lot of people thought frankie edgar 

783
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:40,550
was going to get,
you know,

784
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,660
bj penn is the greatest lightweight of 
all time.

785
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,590
Frankie edgar got beat by gray maynard 
and they're like,

786
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:49,610
yeah,
there's no way this guy's going to beat 

787
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:49,610
him.
Right?

788
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:49,610
So people think that because he's doing 
well,

789
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,990
he's winning like wow,
he's doing better than I thought it was.

790
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,480
So they say,
holy shit,

791
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:54,720
he's beating him,
he's beating them.

792
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,220
But when you go back and you watch it,
that's why it's so much more with so 

793
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,250
much pressure to be a champion.
So much pressure.

794
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,580
I'll never forget this.
When bj penn beat matt hughes,

795
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:08,780
I interviewed matt after the fight and 
matt said that he was relieved.

796
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,950
Yeah,
just all the groups were honest.

797
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,960
He said,
you don't know what it's like to be a 

798
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:16,960
champion and everybody's gone in after 
you.

799
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,510
He goes out.
To be honest with you,

800
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:19,640
I'm really relieved.
And I was really like,

801
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,800
first of all,
I was very impressed with his honesty.

802
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,900
You know,
that's a very honest thing to say,

803
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:25,030
you know,
when you're,

804
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,590
you just fought and you're standing 
there covered in sweat naked in front of

805
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,670
the fucking whole world,
you know,

806
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:30,470
like,
I'm relieved.

807
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:32,540
I just lost right now I can catch a 
breath,

808
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,230
relax.

809
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,820
And then it came back and won the title 
again.

810
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:40,070
Know.
So I think he learned from the 

811
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,101
experience,
but I think it's a tremendous amount of 

812
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:45,431
pressure for guys to,
to fight and defend the title and to 

813
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:49,121
always worry about defending the title,
especially in something like mixed 

814
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:49,520
martial arts.
I mean it's probably a tremendous amount

815
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,790
of pressure if you're a fucking a 
basketball team,

816
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,010
you know,
defending their,

817
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:59,011
their world championship.
But a fighter would use always guys 

818
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:03,130
coming up,
they're gunning for you and every time 

819
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,401
you watch a ufc there's some new 
murderer who's head kick and dudes into 

820
00:35:06,401 --> 00:35:10,391
a fucking coma and he wants to do the 
same shit to you and he's talking shit 

821
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:10,970
about you calling you a faggot and a 
bitch.

822
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:12,770
And I'm like,
jesus christ,

823
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,360
you know,
these guys get that.

824
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,980
That's why they're so god damn 
sensitive.

825
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,020
Is that what's going on right now with 
tito and adele,

826
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:18,410
isn't it?

827
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,910
It seems like it seems like a fighting,
fighting chocolate dough.

828
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,540
Oh really?
Not five chuckled though.

829
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,060
Chuck liddell is going to be fighting 
rich franklin.

830
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:31,061
And I can only say this because it's 
officially been released and was on the 

831
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:32,330
ufc is website.
I can't say why.

832
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,890
And they've been going back and forth on
twitter.

833
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:35,340
I've been noticing it.
It's kind of getting.

834
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,980
Okay,
well that all all come out.

835
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:40,260
What happened in time.
I can't talk about it though.

836
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,580
It's um.
Oh yeah,

837
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,790
that's what it is.
So,

838
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:46,110
um,
anyway,

839
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,820
that's a,
that's that.

840
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,220
Um,
but you know,

841
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:52,680
when,
when dudes are defending their title,

842
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:57,681
I think there's a lot of emotions at 
state and I think that's one of the 

843
00:35:57,681 --> 00:36:00,741
things that people have taken to 
consideration with this anderson silva 

844
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:00,741
fight.
You know,

845
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,720
anderson silva,
everybody's angry at him and every.

846
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:08,721
And it wasn't very disappointing fight,
especially because the first two rounds 

847
00:36:08,721 --> 00:36:10,350
he looked like,
like fucking Bruce Lee.

848
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:15,350
I mean it was like ridiculous shit.
He was eat that flying knee that he hit 

849
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:15,360
him with the first round.
You're like,

850
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:17,670
jesus christ,
she's just going to steam roll this guy.

851
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,490
He's just going to keep doing this until
this guy just crumbles.

852
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,390
It's just gonna keep attacking at will 
and he's breaking this dudes will.

853
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:29,391
It was totally humiliating.
But I think that the emotion of 

854
00:36:29,391 --> 00:36:33,830
defending the title,
the emotion and the pressure of being 

855
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,280
regarded as the best pound for pound 
fighter in the world,

856
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,740
I think that's an insane amount of 
pressure.

857
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,920
I think it's insane.
And I think when damien maia said shit 

858
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,071
to him,
like I'm like take one of his arms home 

859
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:46,071
with me.
You know,

860
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:49,370
henderson got fucking crazy.
So then when he was in there after the 

861
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,401
first rain after is kicking his ass and 
the second round is just start just 

862
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:53,550
talking mad shit and yelling at them in 
portuguese.

863
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:55,210
I wish I understood what the fuck you.

864
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,530
It's not been translated yet.

865
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,550
Well some people have given a rough 
translations of it on the internet,

866
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,470
but I don't know how you could possibly 
hear.

867
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,470
I've watched the fight and I've turned 
the volume of way up.

868
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,370
It's so hard to discern what he's saying
because there's no microphone on him.

869
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:09,660
He's not miked.
Headphones,

870
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,400
man.
And the crowd is screaming,

871
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:13,590
cheering,
and we're talking over him.

872
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:15,210
Right.
So me and mike were talking like,

873
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:17,400
what is he saying?
You know when he's going nuts,

874
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,580
screaming and yelling at,
even if you have headphones on,

875
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:25,260
I think it would still be hard screaming
and yelling at a damien maia and I guess

876
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:28,980
he was calling them like a spoiled rich 
kid or something like that.

877
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:32,670
Like does damien miles like kim's for a 
better upbringing?

878
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:37,671
I don't know what it was.
Where's your jujitsu now is another 

879
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:37,671
thing that people are speculating who 
saying like,

880
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:38,580
where's your jujitsu?
Where's it?

881
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,840
Bam.
Then kicks up.

882
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:40,890
Where did you get to

883
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,200
see?
I didn't have a problem with it.

884
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:47,290
Like I'm not on the boat.
That gain is on and everyone else's on 

885
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:47,840
with it because I don't care about like 
a respect thing to me.

886
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,690
If he can play fucking air guitar in the
ring,

887
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,510
you're putting up against somebody 
that's not.

888
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,540
That shouldn't be there like that.
If you put him in with our caprock 

889
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,110
that's just attacking him where he 
doesn't have a chance to do all this fun

890
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,200
shit in the ring,
then that's different than that guy just

891
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:05,840
go into his back every time because he 
wants to get do jujitsu.

892
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,260
I mean,
he,

893
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,150
if he doesn't want to,
you know,

894
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,070
he was laying on his back.
He kept on going to his back to me.

895
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:11,810
I was like to his

896
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,760
back as he failed to take down and he 
has to do that.

897
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,090
He asked to fall backwards because if he
moves forwards is going to get punted.

898
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,290
He doesn't really.
That's really when,

899
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:26,310
when you pull,
when you shoot on a guy and you don't 

900
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,641
get to take down.
What happens is like say say you shoot 

901
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:28,641
the,
a guy who tried to get ahold of them,

902
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:32,780
he sprawls you have to follow it.
When a guy sprawls he kicks his legs 

903
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,030
back.
When he kicks his legs back,

904
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,760
you have to follow his legs with your 
legs to try to stay a hold of them.

905
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:41,770
Right.
But of course anderson knew this was 

906
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,351
gonna happen and anderson is so much 
more explosive and so much faster than 

907
00:38:43,351 --> 00:38:43,351
him.

908
00:38:43,351 --> 00:38:43,351
Like,
like I've always said,

909
00:38:43,351 --> 00:38:46,360
I think he's in the matrix.
Like I think he's just seeing this shit.

910
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,420
Like he can see something going on five 
seconds before it happens and then I 

911
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:51,420
think,
all right,

912
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:51,730
you got to get somebody that's in the 
matrix.

913
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:54,190
Okay,
but how come he couldn't keep up

914
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,230
doing that because he didn't do that in 
the fourth round.

915
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,790
Fourth round.
He got fucking pumped.

916
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,630
The fourth or the fifth you got hit with
a big ass lefthand,

917
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:00,870
right?

918
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:06,370
Yeah,
because he got stopped doing it because 

919
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,721
he'd heard what all that people booing 
adam and probably dana minded like got 

920
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,050
up and left or something crazy like 
that.

921
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,030
He probably is like,
alright,

922
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:16,100
I guess I have to get out of this matrix
for awhile and be somebody that I'm not 

923
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,290
fucking you.
If you look how smooth and calm he was 

924
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:24,230
up to about the fourth one,
then it seems like something happened 

925
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,170
between the third and the fourth.
He was yelled at or something like that.

926
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,110
You got tired.
That's what happened.

927
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,490
He got tired.
We're outside.

928
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,950
It's super humid.
It's hot as fuck.

929
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,220
It's first time fighting outside.
It's,

930
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,340
you know,
he's gotten two rounds of clowning in 

931
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,030
right now and you know,
I think all that energy that he,

932
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,040
he expended,
he could not keep up that kind of pace.

933
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:47,300
He was winning the fight based on sheer 
explosion and absolutely,

934
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,940
totally avoiding any damage,
which is his style.

935
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,780
But then he got hit when he got hit in 
the third round,

936
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,920
the fourth round rather,
I think it was a fourth of the fifth.

937
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:57,230
He got hit with a big left hand.
I think he shut down.

938
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,010
You haven't.
He was like,

939
00:39:58,011 --> 00:40:00,650
fuck this.
I think he really decided like,

940
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:02,060
I forget my,
I can get hurt here,

941
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:02,750
you know,
like,

942
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,410
and he's tired.
Right.

943
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,810
You know,
so he just decided to keep moving.

944
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,840
I really do think that's what happened 
because the fifth round he didn't do 

945
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:10,880
jack shit,
you know,

946
00:40:10,881 --> 00:40:15,881
and there was,
there was one segment where he was 

947
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:16,820
standing over maya and maya was throwing
bombs that I'm from his knees.

948
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,560
Mine was throwing punches from his knees
and mine was just trying to fucking kill

949
00:40:21,561 --> 00:40:22,850
him.
He just couldn't connect to them.

950
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:28,060
And in that kind of exchange,
normally anderson just lights dudes up,

951
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:33,370
that kind of exchange of guys coming and
attacking and bombing and he doesn't 

952
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,240
counter.
Why isn't encountering he,

953
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,600
he's not,
he's tired.

954
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,250
That's what happened,
you know?

955
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:38,870
And now I don't hear a lot of people 
saying this.

956
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:41,750
I think in the fourth and fifth rounds,
I think he was tired.

957
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,830
I think he was too tired to fight at his
normal pace,

958
00:40:45,831 --> 00:40:50,240
which is his explosion inside and 
outside his speed that he uses.

959
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,330
He's lightening fast math really dives 
in like that.

960
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:58,331
He's so much faster than everybody else.
And that's one of the keys to his 

961
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:58,331
countering.
But when he got tired,

962
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,080
he wasn't as fast anymore.
He just wasn't.

963
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:03,800
He lost a lot of esteem.
And I think he decided to just coast.

964
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,640
It was like,
fuck it,

965
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,870
I want this.
Right.

966
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:06,440
I'm just gonna

967
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,940
do you think that's his fault for being 
able to coast?

968
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:11,380
It's a good point because,
I mean brocklin,

969
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,590
unless somebody coast for two to three 
rounds,

970
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,450
neither would um,

971
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,550
fader fader would put a guy out,
he would,

972
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,920
it would find the guy and put a put feta
or you know,

973
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:24,190
is not afraid to get hit.
Anderson never gets hit or gets faced,

974
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:29,191
bust it up.
And then the brett rogers fight like 

975
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:29,191
right on,
like first round,

976
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,320
first minute,
he got hit with a big jab and his nose 

977
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,721
broke open.
He had a cut on his nose going into the 

978
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:36,721
fight.
Anderson never gets caught.

979
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:41,490
He gets hit.
He got hit more on the damien mind 

980
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,130
either that I ever recall him.
He definitely got hit harder when davy 

981
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:44,130
there's,
there's one,

982
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:49,290
a animated gif online that someone found
of damien maia stepping in and,

983
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:55,101
and cracking silver with a big fucking 
lefthand and it really hit them square 

984
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:57,350
and silver wobbled and moved away and 
started dancing.

985
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,420
That's the guy who got hit.
That's it.

986
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:02,780
I was tired and got hit.
I think he fucked around too much in the

987
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,220
beginning.
He blew a ton of energy.

988
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,050
We're outside.
It's humid.

989
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,690
And then I think psychologically he 
starts thinking,

990
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:10,760
what the fuck am I doing?
You know,

991
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:13,130
I'm acting like an asshole and screaming
and yelling at this guy,

992
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,960
and then he stand in front of the dude 
clown,

993
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:19,961
I'm going to get cracked.
And then I think he just decided to 

994
00:42:19,961 --> 00:42:19,961
move.
Just fuck this.

995
00:42:19,961 --> 00:42:20,800
See,
I'm a huge fan still.

996
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,880
I don't,
I don't care what happened.

997
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:23,900
I think he,
if anything,

998
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:28,901
he learned his lesson and in this shit,
but I don't like all these people are 

999
00:42:28,901 --> 00:42:28,901
like,
you know,

1000
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:31,460
blaming him for this and I,
I just don't see it.

1001
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:33,440
I'm like,
why isn't the other guy,

1002
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,240
the other guy let him.
I'll do all of this.

1003
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,740
Here's the problem.
Here's the problem.

1004
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,230
First of all,
it was a historic ufc.

1005
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,770
He was the headline fight.
And one of the goals of course,

1006
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:47,771
besides winning,
winning is the number one goal for a 

1007
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:47,771
fighter.
But the other goal is to entertain.

1008
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:52,300
You have to realize that you're in a 
partnership with the ufc and the ufc 

1009
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,051
sales paper view.
And what they say sell paper view on is 

1010
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:58,070
based on how impressive and exciting 
your performance.

1011
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,920
Yeah,
but when you see,

1012
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,000
when you play easy and you just run 
away,

1013
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:02,770
you know,
an attack,

1014
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,690
he could have finished that guy off in a
second round.

1015
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,820
He could've maybe finished him off even 
in the third round.

1016
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:11,940
He had just put himself in danger and 
he's not willing to put himself in any 

1017
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,180
danger and he's a well calculated 
fighter.

1018
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,770
I don't see the argument for that.
However,

1019
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,620
for what he did in the fourth round and 
the fifth round,

1020
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:23,080
adults see an argument for because he 
didn't do shit.

1021
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,210
He didn't attack it all.
He didn't fight.

1022
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,370
He literally didn't fight.
Maybe he couldn't,

1023
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:28,710
you know,
I mean,

1024
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,460
he definitely couldn't fight the way he 
fought in the first two rounds and he's 

1025
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,341
not willing.
I think at this point in time with all 

1026
00:43:38,341 --> 00:43:40,261
the pressure on him being widely 
regarded as the best pound for pound 

1027
00:43:40,261 --> 00:43:40,810
fighter in the world,
he's not willing to get an exchange.

1028
00:43:40,811 --> 00:43:41,690
You get cracked.
You know,

1029
00:43:41,691 --> 00:43:44,080
it's got a tremendous use for,
you know,

1030
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,480
I see the entertainment thing,
but I also say,

1031
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,760
hey,
is this entertainment part going?

1032
00:43:48,761 --> 00:43:50,590
Make me lose this fight?
Because if it is,

1033
00:43:50,591 --> 00:43:52,900
I'm not going to do that.
I mean,

1034
00:43:52,901 --> 00:43:57,901
look,
I think there's definitely some worry 

1035
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:57,901
about that.
I think he definitely was worried about,

1036
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:02,610
you know,
if he was tired and if he was going to 

1037
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,160
those fourth and fifth rounds,
the only thing that makes sense to me is

1038
00:44:03,161 --> 00:44:08,161
that he moved around because he didn't 
feel like he could fight at the pace 

1039
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:08,161
that he fought before.

1040
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:08,950
And when that guy hit him,
he said,

1041
00:44:08,951 --> 00:44:10,180
you don't want it.
This isn't a game.

1042
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:12,490
I could get hurt here.
I could lose and I would look completely

1043
00:44:12,491 --> 00:44:14,310
retarded.
So let's just around.

1044
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,010
Fuck this guy.
I'll throw some faint,

1045
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,760
I'll move around.
And you guys that have attacked him.

1046
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,020
Yes.
He couldn't.

1047
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,260
The bottom line with them in mind.
My has tremendous heart,

1048
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:27,460
but his striking is so below what 
anderson's is,

1049
00:44:27,461 --> 00:44:32,461
the only way it's gonna work is if 
anderson's really tired and wasn't 

1050
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,450
willing to stand in front of him when 
he's really tired.

1051
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,660
So who do you think silver can fight?
That would just change the game.

1052
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:39,450
The guy would come in there who won't 
let silva do any of this shit.

1053
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,600
Good question.
Some people say vitor belfort,

1054
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,780
but the problem with vito belfort is 
vituro has had some very uneven 

1055
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:53,001
performances.
Like sometimes he just looks like 

1056
00:44:53,001 --> 00:44:53,001
unstoppable.

1057
00:44:53,001 --> 00:44:53,650
Like against rich franklin,
you know,

1058
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:58,670
against vandelay silva.
He comes charging out in the first 

1059
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,801
round.
But sometimes I forget sakharova things 

1060
00:45:00,801 --> 00:45:02,400
don't go his way and he kind of shuts 
down and guys wind up beating his ass.

1061
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:07,401
Like he broke his hand into sakharova 
fight early and you could see him like 

1062
00:45:07,401 --> 00:45:08,940
totally shut down.
And soc robin just kicked his ass,

1063
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,630
you know,
and the randy couture torrified,

1064
00:45:10,631 --> 00:45:15,631
same thing.
Randy coture just broke up and got on 

1065
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:15,631
top of them.
It's just beat him up.

1066
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:16,800
And his first fight with randy couture 
and it's third fight,

1067
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:19,150
the second fight,
but stop really quickly because it.

1068
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,750
Randy had a cut on his eyelid.
Is eyelid opened up?

1069
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,900
Like it was like split in the it like he
got greg glanced with a punch and then 

1070
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,611
vito became the champ for one fight.
And then when randy beat him up in the 

1071
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:32,820
rematch,
randy gun on top of him just broke them,

1072
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,400
you know,
if,

1073
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,220
if guys put a tremendous amount of 
pressure on him in the past,

1074
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,810
they've been able to break him.

1075
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:45,260
But the other,
the other argument to that as he was 

1076
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:45,260
going through a tremendous amount of 
personal problems back then,

1077
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:45,750
he's a different guy now.
His,

1078
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:50,770
his sister had been abducted and 
kidnapped and killed and he was really 

1079
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:51,440
devastated for years,
you know,

1080
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:56,450
and that he's over that now and it's 
very religious and more at peace with 

1081
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:59,631
himself and more like in tune.
And his last few performances has been 

1082
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,230
staggering.
Like the matt lindland destruction,

1083
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:06,231
he destroyed matt lindland.
He looked outstanding and then he came 

1084
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:07,320
to the ufc and destroyed rich franklin.
I mean he looks scary as fuck.

1085
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:08,930
And anderson,
you know,

1086
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:12,150
did not want that fight.
They were talking mad shit to each other

1087
00:46:12,151 --> 00:46:17,151
and they were at anderson's manager was 
trying to say that victoria doesn't 

1088
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:18,300
deserve the title fight.
Like what are you talking about?

1089
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:20,910
He's the scariest motherfucker.
One 85 besides anderson.

1090
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,520
Of course he deserves it.
I don't think they wanted that fight.

1091
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,690
I think the,
you know,

1092
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:29,830
you,
they can talk all the shit they want 

1093
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:29,830
about him being weak and you know,
if he tours week and he breaks mentally,

1094
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:35,570
he comes at you in that first round.
You have to fight him before you break 

1095
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:35,570
them.
Okay.

1096
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:38,670
And before you break them,
he's throwing lightspeed fucking barrage

1097
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,560
of punches like no one else in the 
business.

1098
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,790
He's scary as fuck.
And if he really is a better,

1099
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:49,791
more mature person,
if it really is more centered now and 

1100
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:52,581
he's not going to break and really is 
like at home with themselves and really 

1101
00:46:52,581 --> 00:46:56,570
his problems in the past where he was 
going through a lot of emotional and 

1102
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,911
personal problems.
But those have actually made him 

1103
00:46:58,911 --> 00:46:58,911
stronger.
If that's the case,

1104
00:46:58,911 --> 00:47:01,200
everybody's fucked because that guy's a 
freak.

1105
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:06,350
He so fucking fast.
He might be the only guy that's faster 

1106
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:10,041
than anderson.
He's a counter striker and he's not as 

1107
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:13,131
long as anderson.
So anderson would have a little bit of 

1108
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:15,380
advantage and a reach advantage,
but goddamn v towards fastest fuck 

1109
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,940
athlete John Jones,
a freak to to put John Jones is two.

1110
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:22,941
Oh five.
John jones can't make one 80 foot gsp 

1111
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:23,070
versus silicon that ever happen.
He was going to happen.

1112
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,050
That's what happened.
It was going,

1113
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:25,950
no,
they'll never do that.

1114
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:29,860
Now they can't trust anderson.
Now they can't trust him to perform.

1115
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,200
And this is what I was saying before,
this is why this fight was so important.

1116
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,240
This is why they're so pissed.
Okay?

1117
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,740
Because the last two rounds,
you know,

1118
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:40,741
him just running away the ufc his own 10
percent of his own by flash 

1119
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:44,020
entertainment,
which is the royal family in abu dhabi.

1120
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,450
And this was like a huge showcase for 
them.

1121
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,630
This was like their big acquisition,
you know,

1122
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,410
they're partners now and they're going 
to help bring the ufc to all these world

1123
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:56,710
markets all over the world.
So everyone's all excited about this.

1124
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,840
So then they have this huge event where 
it's like a $3 million dollar gate,

1125
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,060
okay.
For ticket sales,

1126
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,990
they have fucking ferrari world.
They put it inside for our first outside

1127
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:09,790
thing.
The thing looks fantastic.

1128
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:12,310
The crowd is insane.
The crowd was awesome.

1129
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:15,550
They were so pumped up.
Everybody was super fucking rowdy.

1130
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,250
Every fight was chaos except the bj 
penn,

1131
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:20,170
frankie edgar fight.
That was just very close,

1132
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:25,340
you know,
but there was some wild ass flights 

1133
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:25,340
before the black.
Brad,

1134
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:25,340
brad,
brad,

1135
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:29,310
brad blackburn and demarcus johnson got 
damn kendall grove and Mark Munoz.

1136
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,540
That fucking fight was awesome.
It was just not.

1137
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,030
The crowd is height to the gills.

1138
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,180
Anderson silva comes in,
they go fucking crazy.

1139
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,630
The new sunshine.
We're in shoes.

1140
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,680
The music plays.
You see him dance dancing.

1141
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:46,690
They're going fucking bananas and he 
runs for the last two rounds and dude,

1142
00:48:46,811 --> 00:48:49,950
it was a disaster.
Everybody walked out of there with their

1143
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,940
head hung,
shaking their head going,

1144
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,190
what the fuck?
Everyone was disappointed.

1145
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,950
It wasn't like.
There was two arguments.

1146
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,330
Some people were saying,
wow,

1147
00:48:58,331 --> 00:48:59,830
I see his point.
Why take a chance?

1148
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,920
No,
everyone was bummed out what the ufc 

1149
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,681
cells is just wild shit.
You're selling wild fucking chaos fights

1150
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:14,580
the most exciting sport in the world.
What anderson silva is selling is he's 

1151
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,841
the very best at the wild shit and 
meanwhile he didn't do it the last two 

1152
00:49:18,941 --> 00:49:20,110
rounds.
He just ran away.

1153
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,330
That's terrible for the business.
It's terrible for what the ufc is trying

1154
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:26,950
to accomplish in other countries.

1155
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:30,190
It's terrible for the new partnership 
with flash entertainment.

1156
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:35,350
It's terrible.
But have a ufc outside and all the 

1157
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,010
fighters be added their helmet to it is,
you're right.

1158
00:49:36,011 --> 00:49:38,380
But it's even,
they're both out of their element.

1159
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,820
Yeah.
But they're also.

1160
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:41,380
I mean,
that's just different,

1161
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:43,000
you know,
that's like one who has fun and he was,

1162
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,700
he was fighting though.
It was cool down.

1163
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:47,500
It cooled down to like maybe a 
seventies,

1164
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,060
but the first guy's.
Yeah,

1165
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:53,470
john madsen and uh,
and staff.

1166
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,450
I'll turn those motherfuckers fought in 
a sauna.

1167
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,920
Which you think about that gracie fight 
though.

1168
00:49:56,921 --> 00:49:58,270
I,
I thought that was awful.

1169
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:03,390
Well,
hanzo hadn't trained for two and a half 

1170
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:03,390
years.
Wow.

1171
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:07,020
That's a long time.
I said it didn't train at all this what 

1172
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:07,020
he said in the post fight interview.
And then he,

1173
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,830
um,
trained for six months for the fight and

1174
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:09,640
it just wasn't enough.

1175
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:14,910
Matt hughes for him,
he had been looking to knock somebody 

1176
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:14,910
out forever.
So for him it was,

1177
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:19,410
it was an awesome opportunity to finally
get someone who's going to stand in 

1178
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:19,410
front of them.
Wow.

1179
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:19,420
You know,
like legs and.

1180
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:20,270
Yeah,
he like,

1181
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:25,290
kicked the shit out of them.
I thought it was going to take them 

1182
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:25,290
down.
I thought he would beat him from the top

1183
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:29,280
because matthew is,
even though a kenzo has really good 

1184
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,310
jujitsu,
jujitsu is very underrated and he's just

1185
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,410
very,
very strong.

1186
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:32,150
And his wrestling,
I'm like,

1187
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:37,151
okay.
We did the hoist when he got him on the 

1188
00:50:37,151 --> 00:50:38,681
ground,
he doesn't land through voice when he 

1189
00:50:38,681 --> 00:50:38,681
got him on the ground.
Yeah,

1190
00:50:38,681 --> 00:50:39,410
he's strong as fuck man.
And I just think,

1191
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,250
uh,
you know,

1192
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:45,251
it had been more exciting if they went 
to the ground now there were both would 

1193
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,290
have been in their element instead.
It was like a sloppy kickboxing.

1194
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:47,330
He was bad.
Yeah.

1195
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:49,390
It looked like ultimate fighter.
Like the first episode.

1196
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:50,480
Yeah,
yeah,

1197
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,320
yeah,
yeah.

1198
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:53,180
Like,
like the tv show.

1199
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:53,550
Yeah,
yeah,

1200
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:54,330
yeah,
it's so much.

1201
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,400
They're mean,
they're both doing things they're not 

1202
00:50:59,400 --> 00:50:59,400
good at.
It's like you and I were going to have a

1203
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,400
one on one game of basketball.
Right.

1204
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,540
We pulled that.

1205
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:03,900
It's terrible,
you know,

1206
00:51:03,901 --> 00:51:06,740
but you know,
if they both had a um,

1207
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,090
if they try to take each other down and 
you know,

1208
00:51:09,091 --> 00:51:10,350
and,
and how to ground battle,

1209
00:51:10,351 --> 00:51:12,900
that would have been exciting as fuck 
for matthew's notes.

1210
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:16,020
It was a smart move.
He had an advantage standing up and plus

1211
00:51:16,021 --> 00:51:18,210
no one's going to take him down.
It's very tough to take that guy.

1212
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:21,900
But you gotta be like gsp to take matt.
He was down so he wasn't gonna take them

1213
00:51:21,901 --> 00:51:22,770
down.
And matt,

1214
00:51:22,771 --> 00:51:24,210
he's felt like he had an advanced 
standing,

1215
00:51:24,211 --> 00:51:25,890
so beat him up.
So that's what he did.

1216
00:51:25,891 --> 00:51:30,891
He beat him up with leg kicks,
slow them down and then eventually 

1217
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:31,200
planted them.
You know,

1218
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,660
I think matthew is still has a lot of 
fights in them.

1219
00:51:33,661 --> 00:51:38,661
If he wants to do,
there's still a lot of good matchup for 

1220
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:38,661
him if he really gets motivated.
I don't think he's gonna fight like that

1221
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:43,611
with that many people though.
I think his decision to stand up with 

1222
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:45,000
him was purely based on that.
He felt like he had an advantage in that

1223
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:45,510
position.

1224
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,000
It needs to change his opening song 
already.

1225
00:51:48,001 --> 00:51:51,680
I'm done with it.
Oh goddamn class.

1226
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:00,990
Now,
because you said that your mother 

1227
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,481
fucker.
I'm just saying that you know it's done 

1228
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:06,681
with that.
I think my favorite fights are the 

1229
00:52:06,681 --> 00:52:09,720
japanese do.
That's not fighting anymore of the ufc 

1230
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,991
because he lost the last one where he 
dresses up and he has fun with the 

1231
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:12,900
opening.
Like the japanese guy.

1232
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,000
He is my favorite man when he's a fuck.
I wish they would.

1233
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:19,920
There's no chance he's ever coming back 
to usc.

1234
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:23,140
Right.
I'll really go almost still pretty young

1235
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:24,400
man.
I liked him.

1236
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,740
He's one of my kids.
Loves this song.

1237
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:26,340
Motherfucker.

1238
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,720
A great goddamn song.
So you never wanted to live in the woods

1239
00:52:39,301 --> 00:52:44,301
like this motherfucker.
I liked it the first 500 times I'm 

1240
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:45,630
hurting.
I don't give a shit when he comes out to

1241
00:52:45,631 --> 00:52:50,631
that bucket to come on.
Son isn't the greatest walkout music 

1242
00:52:50,631 --> 00:52:52,490
ever,
in my opinion.

1243
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,690
There's no better walk out music and 
this song.

1244
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,720
No better match.
Doesn't,

1245
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,070
doesn't.
What's better?

1246
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,290
Come on son.
It's perfect for him.

1247
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,530
Mix it up a little.
I'm always about mixing it up.

1248
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:12,510
One a million fucking fights with that 
song.

1249
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:13,290
Yeah.
Fuck you.

1250
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,790
It's grace on it.
Plus the ufc owns outside.

1251
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:18,020
That's perfect.
They bought the rights to.

1252
00:53:18,021 --> 00:53:21,100
That's really because of the med schools
so they can use the.

1253
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,040
The time.
Yeah,

1254
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,100
they're.
The ufc is fucking crazy.

1255
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:27,630
Is there any new kimbo fight versus 
montreal?

1256
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,320
Um,
may May 9th,

1257
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,490
ninth in montreal.
Nice.

1258
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:34,280
Go.
If you want to go.

1259
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:34,980
Yeah.

1260
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:41,850
It gets fucking floor seats to the ufc.
You have all you people out there that 

1261
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:41,850
are like,
fuck man,

1262
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:42,490
I would love to go.
You can't even.

1263
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,760
No,
that's bullshit.

1264
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,500
So,
uh,

1265
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,820
I actually prefer it.
Dude.

1266
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,470
I'll watching on tv.
Yeah,

1267
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:53,720
you were to tell you.
I bet you would if you were with it.

1268
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:58,740
We go to barney's beanery now.
There will come a time where I will be 

1269
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:58,740
watching it on tv.
I'm not going to do this forever.

1270
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,950
Yeah,
we go to barney's beanery.

1271
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,910
There's a tv at our table,
a plasma right in front of us.

1272
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,480
There was like movie theater,
have tvs.

1273
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,140
We got waitresses bringing us the joke 
for worst food ever beer.

1274
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:10,270
There's like 20 of us.
I mean it's like I'm already.

1275
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,470
That's better.
Right?

1276
00:54:11,471 --> 00:54:13,030
It's way better.
It is better.

1277
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,830
God damn it.
You got to call in sick soon.

1278
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:17,690
I know,
right?

1279
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,490
I'm responsible for part of the 
entertainment part of it though.

1280
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,490
The talking part,
you know,

1281
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,190
I would like to.
I like watching it with commentary men.

1282
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:26,820
Oh,
I don't.

1283
00:54:26,821 --> 00:54:31,821
I would way rather watch somebody else 
do commentary like michael chavela or 

1284
00:54:31,821 --> 00:54:36,290
like michael chavela and goldberg got 
together and then like put a fighter in 

1285
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:36,390
there like pat military or something 
like that.

1286
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,940
I'd be happy as fuck to sit home and 
watch that.

1287
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,490
You stick it.
Can't do it from your home.

1288
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:46,491
Like you know how like xm radio stations
that they could do their shipping alone 

1289
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:49,730
now to many kids just sit there with a 
tv and whatnot to interview the 

1290
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:50,140
fighters.
Holograms,

1291
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,380
man with a monitor.
Real doll.

1292
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:59,760
That's what we like.
What we were talking about before,

1293
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:01,630
that one,
they could replicate people.

1294
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,030
The first thing to do is replicate 
celebrities so you could fuck them.

1295
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,490
Yeah.
So no.

1296
00:55:06,491 --> 00:55:08,800
I eventually though I'm just going to 
just stand up.

1297
00:55:08,801 --> 00:55:12,240
I don't know when it's gonna happen,
but maybe sooner than later I'm,

1298
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:14,230
I'm not.
I don't like all this traveling,

1299
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:14,730
you know?

1300
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,650
That's crazy.
That was one of your health.

1301
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,840
There's one thing that everyone was 
talking about,

1302
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:22,420
the borrow is at,
is that there's too many ufc is now.

1303
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:23,710
Yeah.
They were all talking about that.

1304
00:55:23,711 --> 00:55:24,350
Really?
Yeah.

1305
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:29,490
Were like,
that's why we're coming here because I 

1306
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,171
can't afford to ufc a month.
Meanwhile the paper view numbers are 

1307
00:55:31,171 --> 00:55:31,171
still.
Yeah,

1308
00:55:31,171 --> 00:55:31,630
absolutely.
There always be awesome.

1309
00:55:31,631 --> 00:55:32,650
You know,
the point is though,

1310
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:33,340
the more they do it

1311
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:37,710
more grows and the more it becomes a 
part of the culture and it's 12 months a

1312
00:55:37,711 --> 00:55:39,510
year and it never stops.
I mean it really is.

1313
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:41,510
Gonna take over everything.
It's gonna.

1314
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:42,900
You know,
what's gonna happen eventually?

1315
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,060
I'll probably just do the vegas ones 
eventually.

1316
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,320
Yeah,
just do some of them,

1317
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:47,010
you know,

1318
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,520
or the la to la.
They won't come back

1319
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,830
very often.
They go to la once a year,

1320
00:55:51,831 --> 00:55:54,560
every two years or something like that.
Say we've got too many places to go.

1321
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:58,400
We gotta go to fucking Germany and 
Ireland and Australia.

1322
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,920
I don't have to be crazy.
Well,

1323
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,330
the wec went to Ohio this year.
I know,

1324
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:08,570
but why do you have to go to Afghanistan
and why don't you just go to Ohio 

1325
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:09,300
because they want to take over the 
world,

1326
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,040
you know,
they want to take over the world.

1327
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,230
Look,
they have a product that was very,

1328
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:16,020
very undersold when they first came into
the ufc.

1329
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:20,100
The ufc had insane potential but very 
little coverage.

1330
00:56:20,101 --> 00:56:21,360
Very few people know about it.
When,

1331
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,460
when I first started working for the ufc
was in 1997

1332
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,860
and that the company that I worked for 
was seg,

1333
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:30,340
a much smaller company than the ufc.
Now zuph.

1334
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:31,120
Uh,
it was,

1335
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,520
you know,
it was a,

1336
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:35,020
we did a lot of the same guys are still 
there.

1337
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:40,810
A lot of the behind the scenes gas.
We did shows in like little fucking high

1338
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:43,840
school auditoriums and like doeth in 
Alabama and shit,

1339
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:47,290
like really small ass shows and we 
always said,

1340
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,480
you know what,
this sport needs this support needs some

1341
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:54,481
fucking crazy billionaires who just 
loved the sport to come in there and 

1342
00:56:54,481 --> 00:56:56,200
just shoving in front of people's faces,
put it on tv,

1343
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,750
spend a fuckload of money and make it 
huge.

1344
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,670
But nobody ever thought that was really 
gonna happen.

1345
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,260
But that is what happened with zoo fa.
What happened is these guys had owned 22

1346
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:10,120
fucking casinos happened to be ufc fans 
and they decided to buy it for fun.

1347
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,440
You know,
let's buy the ufc.

1348
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:13,450
That'll be fun.
So they get dana to run it.

1349
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,480
I mean,
you'd have to be crazy to get that 

1350
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:18,480
fucking guy to run it.
You know what I mean?

1351
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,450
Think about that are really intelligent,
but he's the perfect guy.

1352
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,100
The perfect,
the perfect guy for it,

1353
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:26,101
but what other corporation would have us
as a president or a ceo like that I 

1354
00:57:26,101 --> 00:57:26,330
fighting,

1355
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,170
there are no other ones.
You know what I'm saying?

1356
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:30,160
It's like you would go,
okay,

1357
00:57:30,161 --> 00:57:30,490
what happened?

1358
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:35,060
Businessman who would step in and do it,
and meanwhile I'm dana is just a nut and

1359
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:36,050
a crazy fight.
Phenome.

1360
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,850
He's the perfect guy for the job.
Literally,

1361
00:57:37,851 --> 00:57:39,200
you couldn't get a better guy for the 
job,

1362
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,590
but you know,
then they took over.

1363
00:57:42,591 --> 00:57:45,380
But they realized when they took over,
once it started taking off,

1364
00:57:45,381 --> 00:57:47,240
after the ultimate fighter tv show 
started airing,

1365
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:51,920
they realized that all the sport needed 
in America was exposure.

1366
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,520
And this is a sport that transcends 
cultural boundaries,

1367
00:57:55,521 --> 00:57:56,660
languages,
it,

1368
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:59,030
it transcends everything.
Traditions.

1369
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,580
Everybody understands fighting.
You know,

1370
00:58:01,581 --> 00:58:04,070
nobody's going to watch fucking cricket 
in America.

1371
00:58:04,071 --> 00:58:05,870
You're never going to sell that.
You know,

1372
00:58:05,871 --> 00:58:08,570
you can try to make people think they're
sophisticated.

1373
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:11,540
If they enjoy soccer or maybe you know,
your family's from latin America,

1374
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:16,541
so you like soccer,
but no one is going to fucking buy 

1375
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:16,850
cricket.
They're not going to buy cricket.

1376
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,360
But fighting,
fighting is everywhere you can.

1377
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:23,960
You can watch fighting in China,
you can watch fighting in Germany.

1378
00:58:23,961 --> 00:58:28,961
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter if you understand the 

1379
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:30,761
language it.
I'd like watching the old prides when 

1380
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:30,761
the,
uh,

1381
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:34,930
I used to get prides straight from Japan
and the commentary would all be in 

1382
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:35,320
japanese.
It was fucking awesome.

1383
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:36,240
Yeah.
I didn't even know what that was,

1384
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:41,490
but I will get knocked up,
will go crazy.

1385
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:43,750
Screaming to japanese.
It was fucking awesome.

1386
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:45,040
I didn't have to know what they were 
saying.

1387
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:46,470
I love it.
I loved everything about party.

1388
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,850
Even the opening walk,
I thought it was great.

1389
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:49,280
I did

1390
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,570
pageantry.
How the other giant screens,

1391
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:54,290
the dude's face on it and shit.
I thought that was pretty.

1392
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,390
I think it's fun,
man.

1393
00:58:55,391 --> 00:58:57,630
It's ridiculous.
They had pyrotechnics for awhile,

1394
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,630
but then uh,
uh,

1395
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,570
Joe Hill,
de oliveira got burned.

1396
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,280
He got barbecued during one of the 
pyrotechnics.

1397
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,420
Mma tried to do right?
Yeah.

1398
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:11,410
They have like live music bands.
I can't rock with talking about elite.

1399
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,810
That was so stupid.
Yeah.

1400
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,280
They had a band play a song.
Auto affliction.

1401
00:59:18,281 --> 00:59:20,420
Did that affliction.
Affliction?

1402
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:20,890
Yeah.
Of.

1403
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:22,160
Yeah.
Those

1404
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:27,160
silly fox.
They had a band play a song in the 

1405
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:27,770
middle of the fucking fight,
like in the mid,

1406
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,930
in the middle of the show.
Was he in the middle show?

1407
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,370
Were fights,
fights,

1408
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:34,070
go on and then the band play and that's 
what it was in the beginning.

1409
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,410
I think that's what it was in between 
fights or something like that.

1410
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:39,560
So dom and you don't want to mix that.
It's like people have asked me before,

1411
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:41,840
it's like open up for bands,
like do comedy for uh,

1412
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:46,870
you know,
we're gonna have like four bands we'd 

1413
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:47,570
like you to go on in the middle.
Do comedy doesn't work like that man.

1414
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:52,750
Nobody wants to see your comedy,
whether in the groove to see music and 

1415
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,460
nobody wants to see your fucking band.
If they're in the group to see fights,

1416
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,760
you know,
it's just like you can't stop a rock 

1417
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:00,760
concert,
put on a fight.

1418
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:00,760
You can't do it.

1419
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,760
It wouldn't be as good.
You know,

1420
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:06,761
you couldn't have like some fucking 
awesome rolling stones concert and then 

1421
01:00:06,761 --> 01:00:09,500
stop it halfway through the middle and 
have like an nma fight.

1422
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,850
People will be like,
what is this?

1423
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:12,840
This is bullshit.
What am I following?

1424
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,650
You,
you only.

1425
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,960
It's,
it's better when you only have one 

1426
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:20,960
thing.
One thing is good.

1427
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,360
These extravaganzas with adjustable,
I hate doing like award shows to comedy 

1428
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:30,251
on award shows because they have like 
all these awards and little clips and 

1429
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,220
then you do standup in the middle of it.
It's like,

1430
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:36,320
oh,
the last time I did that was the guy's 

1431
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:36,800
towards the ward for spike.
It was disastrous.

1432
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,590
It was terrible.
Nobody wanted to hear anybody's comedy.

1433
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,260
It was like the whole thing was like 
they were sitting there for three hours,

1434
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:47,410
watch some boring ass award show,
so they wanted to just get the fuck out 

1435
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:47,410
of there by the time I got on was.

1436
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:48,920
Did you hear about that?
Conan gail?

1437
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,560
Yeah.
He's got to do tvs right before lopez.

1438
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:53,810
That's good for him.
Both of them.

1439
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:54,590
For both of them.
Yeah.

1440
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:56,030
I don't know why.
I think it's good for him too.

1441
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,890
It's because they'll let him do whatever
the fuck you want.

1442
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,620
Yeah,
exactly.

1443
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:05,860
Ubs is going to blow up,
not blow up and by the way has already 

1444
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:05,860
rich.
Right.

1445
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:08,110
He made so much money from that.
Just leaving be,

1446
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:13,430
you know,
I think even like 35 million bucks he 

1447
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:13,430
can do whatever the fuck he wants.
Now.

1448
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:14,470
Is tbs the same company as spike?
No,

1449
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,800
I don't think so.
I don't know.

1450
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:19,010
Just comedy central is comedy central 
and spike or that's why my,

1451
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:21,650
my special first year and I was black 
and then are on comedy central.

1452
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:26,930
Um,
and you can get my that dvds available 

1453
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:26,930
now.
So go,

1454
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:27,410
go buy the amazon link on your website.

1455
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:29,270
Yeah,
it's on my way on joe rogan.net

1456
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:32,660
and it's on a,
it was the number two on itunes.

1457
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,970
I don't know if it still is.
Yeah,

1458
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,080
robin williams.
What the fuck's hilarious.

1459
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:38,510
Did you ever go ahead of beto?
I don't know if I ever been,

1460
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,320
but god,
how could I don't get that?

1461
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,770
I understand how some people think some 
things,

1462
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,220
some things are funny.
You know,

1463
01:01:46,221 --> 01:01:48,620
there's some guys that I get that people
think they're funny,

1464
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:52,070
but I don't see it.
The robin williams thing goes right over

1465
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:53,190
my head.
I just,

1466
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:54,680
I go,
what are you laughing at?

1467
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:57,770
I have never laughed at him once.
Maybe in a movie,

1468
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,070
you know,
like whenever,

1469
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:04,860
something like that,
when I was a kid I listened to stand up 

1470
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,271
because it was raunchy,
like he was talking about this deck and 

1471
01:02:07,271 --> 01:02:07,430
I was like seven years old watching hbo,
you know,

1472
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:09,320
so that's the only reason I ever liked 
him.

1473
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:14,380
He never did it for me.
And then when I heard he was a giant 

1474
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,230
thief,
then he's forever tainted.

1475
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:17,660
Like even if he says something funny,
I'm watching him.

1476
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:18,920
He says something funny.
I'm like,

1477
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,940
where'd you get that from?
Another steal that from you.

1478
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:22,110
Fuck right.
Uh,

1479
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,230
so,
uh,

1480
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,440
crazy celebrities.
Do you hear about steven seagal?

1481
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,320
Steven seagal got arrested.
He did?

1482
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,630
Yes.
Impossible.

1483
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,300
He's getting,
he's getting.

1484
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:30,780
Oh,
I'm sorry.

1485
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:32,730
Just getting sued.
He didn't get arrested.

1486
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,410
Andy dick is dick got arrested?
Yeah.

1487
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,940
And did you hear about that?
Walked into someone's house?

1488
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:44,120
Well he was also the day before he was 
thrown out of a winery in santa barbara 

1489
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:48,720
for being too drunk.
How do you get thrown out of a winery?

1490
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,160
Dr.
Drew.

1491
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,440
You don't.
If you're out there,

1492
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:53,900
I blame you.
Uh,

1493
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,090
why do you believe dr to have enabled 
dandy dick?

1494
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:58,750
Sir?
He was on sober house with dr drew.

1495
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,780
Oh,
that's fine.

1496
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,730
I don't know.
It wasn't dr silver house.

1497
01:03:02,731 --> 01:03:03,690
Was that it?
I don't think.

1498
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:04,860
Whichever one it is.
What does it?

1499
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:06,930
Celebrity rehab was young.
I had one of them.

1500
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:09,840
He was on celebrity rehab or something.
I dunno,

1501
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,420
he's practiced.

1502
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,000
Maybe dick.
Maybe.

1503
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:17,001
I'm just imagining how rude dr drew.
We're just kidding.

1504
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,020
Just kidding.
Oh,

1505
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,140
fucking celebrity rehab is spectacular.
It's one of my favorite shows ever.

1506
01:03:22,141 --> 01:03:25,650
If you ever wanted like motivation to 
not do drugs.

1507
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,940
Watch tom sizemore on.
What about that chick that,

1508
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,660
that.
Oh,

1509
01:03:30,661 --> 01:03:35,230
annoying was the crazy sex attic check.
I,

1510
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,300
I swear to god,
she's one of those girls that,

1511
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:42,360
that they shouldn't even have her on the
show because it's just disgusting to 

1512
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:42,360
watch.
She's pretty gross.

1513
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:47,240
I actually liked the.
Ended up liking the girl from that day 

1514
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,930
was that she used to be on that old 
sitcom a that has the dog that died 

1515
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:49,990
during the show.
Uh,

1516
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,540
that wrote the book about being 
molested.

1517
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:55,130
Mackenzie phillips liked her.
She's a nice person.

1518
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,880
She seemed cool to her whole store is a 
horrible.

1519
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:03,510
Yeah,
it is horrible if you don't have those 

1520
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:03,510
stories.
Mackenzie phillips.

1521
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:06,250
Dad fucked her like her whole life.
She had a sexual relationship with her 

1522
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:11,231
dad like her whole life and her dad shot
her up with heroin or with cocaine when 

1523
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:14,330
she was 11.
Jesus christ.

1524
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:17,650
What a 11.
And her.

1525
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,310
Her dad shut her up with coke.
I mean,

1526
01:04:19,311 --> 01:04:24,311
the whole thing is just the most 
horrific thing you could ever possibly 

1527
01:04:24,311 --> 01:04:27,980
imagine that someone would do this to 
their kid and fuck their kid their whole

1528
01:04:27,981 --> 01:04:30,020
life had a sexual relationship with 
their kid.

1529
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:32,030
It to the point where she told her like,
hey,

1530
01:04:32,031 --> 01:04:37,031
we could leave.
When you go to countries where this is 

1531
01:04:37,031 --> 01:04:37,031
totally acceptable,
what country is he going to go to?

1532
01:04:37,031 --> 01:04:38,990
What country is it acceptable to fuck 
your kids?

1533
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:41,930
Is there one out there now that should 
be just death?

1534
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:43,340
Jesus christ.

1535
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:45,630
Nice to be death.
Yeah.

1536
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,120
Well,
speaking of death,

1537
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:52,150
the catholic religion is fighting to.
They're trying to impose a statute of 

1538
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:57,541
limitations on sexual molestation cases 
because right now there's a statute of 

1539
01:04:57,541 --> 01:04:59,420
limitations on sexual molestation cases.
That's like,

1540
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:04,750
I believe it's like 30 years.
So they're trying to impose a,

1541
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:10,790
they're,
they're trying to make sure that that 

1542
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:10,790
sticks.
They,

1543
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:10,790
they want to make sure that,
um,

1544
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:14,950
they don't,
they don't change it to no statute of 

1545
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,130
limitations because then anytime someone
has a case right now,

1546
01:05:16,131 --> 01:05:19,390
if a case is more than 30 years old,
I think it's 30 years.

1547
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:22,660
Pretty sure the case is more than 30 
years old.

1548
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,510
You have to,
if you're going to be a part of a case,

1549
01:05:25,511 --> 01:05:28,270
you have to be joining with other people
that are,

1550
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:33,271
that are also inside the case.
So say if someone has a case that's 29 

1551
01:05:33,271 --> 01:05:35,320
years old and yours is 30 and the same 
priest buck to you,

1552
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:36,520
then you can join in.

1553
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,500
But if yours is the individual case 
there,

1554
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:43,510
they're saying you don't want you to be 
able to sue.

1555
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:44,650
And people are saying,
no,

1556
01:05:44,651 --> 01:05:45,850
this is crazy.
Crazy.

1557
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:50,940
And meanwhile,
the catholic church is urging people to 

1558
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:51,760
vote against this because they're saying
that it's an assault on the church.

1559
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:57,060
How is pedophiles?
How is shielding pedophiles with a 

1560
01:05:57,281 --> 01:06:02,281
statute of limitations?
How has that fucking helping the church 

1561
01:06:02,281 --> 01:06:05,540
and how would getting rid of any,
any statute of limitations that would 

1562
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:10,410
impose a timeline for when you can be 
prosecuted for a horrible crime against 

1563
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:12,130
humanity?
How could that be what god wants?

1564
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:13,250
That god wants you to

1565
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,530
sick of it.
Joe,

1566
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,800
you know,
ridiculous.

1567
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,330
Joe.
I was thinking about today.

1568
01:06:17,331 --> 01:06:18,980
I just got in a huge fight with my 
sister.

1569
01:06:18,981 --> 01:06:21,290
I unfaced book or your sister.
Let's talk about.

1570
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,190
Well,
you can't talk about it.

1571
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:25,070
I can't,
but I can tell you that I unfaced bucked

1572
01:06:25,071 --> 01:06:27,130
her and because I on facebook,
teresa,

1573
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:32,170
she's about to have a baby and she said 
that I could no longer be an uncle 

1574
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:35,740
because I on facebook,
but there's only two times be an uncle 

1575
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:35,740
anymore.
She's not allowing me.

1576
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:40,600
Oh,
let's all stand would be an uncle to my 

1577
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:40,600
daughter.
How sure I am.

1578
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:44,930
I'm the uncle,
his uncle.

1579
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:50,350
So anyways,
there was a two times that I've gotten 

1580
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:51,950
into such a huge fight with my sister.
Both of these times.

1581
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,300
It rooted from religion.

1582
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,190
Well,
you know,

1583
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:59,230
I met.
People want to believe that there are 

1584
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:00,340
some rules and regulations to the world 
because it makes them feel better.

1585
01:07:00,341 --> 01:07:02,020
And when you come along and say that 
they're not,

1586
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:04,030
that they don't exist,
then it makes them.

1587
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:09,070
We have to reevaluate their whole life 
and they fucking hate it and they get 

1588
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:09,430
angry at you because you're fucking up 
their piece.

1589
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,490
You're fucking.
They have developed a piece of mine from

1590
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:15,100
the idea that god is great,
god is good,

1591
01:07:15,101 --> 01:07:20,101
and you do the right things.
You're going to go to heaven like that 

1592
01:07:20,101 --> 01:07:20,101
helps them get through the day,
man.

1593
01:07:20,101 --> 01:07:22,570
And for a lot of people it's a nice 
simple box to put the world at.

1594
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:22,980
And when you

1595
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,850
go fuck,
it's a fucking box look,

1596
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:30,940
fuck.
They want that box back.

1597
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:35,941
Then it makes sense.
So the real problem is when anybody 

1598
01:07:35,941 --> 01:07:37,870
tells you that they know,
that's when the problem came over.

1599
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,730
Game over,
man,

1600
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:41,930
you can't.

1601
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,300
You know,
you don't know man.

1602
01:07:45,301 --> 01:07:47,100
You're not dead,
you're not in heaven,

1603
01:07:47,101 --> 01:07:49,350
you're not an alien,
you're not from the future.

1604
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:50,900
You don't know.
Shut the fuck up.

1605
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:52,800
Don't know.
Fuck it all,

1606
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:54,060
fuck religion,
fuck,

1607
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,710
fuck.
Any ideologies,

1608
01:07:55,711 --> 01:07:57,810
anybody telling you how you can live 
your life.

1609
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,160
You know what?
What is good?

1610
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:04,250
When people offer advice and people say,
this is what I've learned from my 

1611
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:07,821
mistakes and this is what I've learned 
from my life and this could possibly 

1612
01:08:07,821 --> 01:08:08,100
benefit you if you come across the same 
situations.

1613
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:10,500
This is what I've learned.
This has made my life easier.

1614
01:08:10,501 --> 01:08:12,810
This made my life better.
I learned to be nicer to people.

1615
01:08:12,811 --> 01:08:14,490
I learned to suck it up.
When this happens,

1616
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,010
I learned to look in the mirror.
When you

1617
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,080
got problems,
I learned to evaluate,

1618
01:08:18,081 --> 01:08:19,190
you know,
look at my own life.

1619
01:08:19,191 --> 01:08:24,191
Objectively.
Forest are pointed the finger at other 

1620
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,191
people.
Those are all things that can help you.

1621
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,010
When you start talking about,
you know,

1622
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:27,150
you kind of have pork and I love this 
number.

1623
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,000
Here's a photo of mohammed is available.

1624
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:34,010
Well,
you must miss that guy keeps on getting 

1625
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:34,010
threatened.
He don't.

1626
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:34,010
He almost got killed,
murdered the other day.

1627
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:39,140
The guy that,
the cartoonist that drew mohammed the 

1628
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:39,140
other day,
he almost got like,

1629
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:39,630
it was like last week or something like 
that.

1630
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:42,610
People have been killed for that.
People have been killed for drawing.

1631
01:08:42,611 --> 01:08:42,920
Muhammad.

1632
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:45,130
Why is trey parker and matt stone not 
dead yet?

1633
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:47,530
They drama humble.
They had a whole episode about muhammad.

1634
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,640
That's a good question.
This guy just had a stupid family circus

1635
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:54,050
comic when I went over to,
uh,

1636
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:55,330
uh,
abu dhabi.

1637
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:00,480
I was thinking,
I hope none of these motherfuckers have 

1638
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:00,480
a copy of shiny happy gi.
No sticking.

1639
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,130
I us thinking that dude my fucking seat,
my last cd,

1640
01:09:03,131 --> 01:09:05,590
not this one,
but the one before that was called shiny

1641
01:09:05,591 --> 01:09:08,350
happy jihad.
Or they probably know that I have a copy

1642
01:09:08,351 --> 01:09:13,351
of it.
I'm going to start giving them away 

1643
01:09:13,351 --> 01:09:13,351
because I just got a box of them.
Right.

1644
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,250
Did your one cd is out of print?
I still think the idea of.

1645
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:19,710
I had an idea.
He has this odd cdd,

1646
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,140
can't do it.
Remixes,

1647
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:23,650
remixes,
remix the bits into like,

1648
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:25,490
you know,
because they're kids,

1649
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,240
but they're gone.
They got to go,

1650
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:29,100
I need a new sheriff in town,

1651
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,350
but this is,
this was what I was worried.

1652
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:34,480
If you don't not familiar with any of my
comedy,

1653
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:38,170
it's fucking,
it's called shiny happy jihad.

1654
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:43,320
And it's me.
Can you see that was the just.

1655
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:49,630
There we go.
It's me with fucking dmt and it says g 

1656
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:50,710
on it.
I mean,

1657
01:09:50,711 --> 01:09:54,370
that's probably one of my best cds.
I think it's my favorite.

1658
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,220
Uh,
the last one is really good too.

1659
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:59,590
The last one's a little heavier.
This one's a little sillier,

1660
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:01,720
but I don't know.
That's one of my favorites.

1661
01:10:01,721 --> 01:10:02,680
But I was like,
god,

1662
01:10:02,681 --> 01:10:07,681
I hope none of these motherfuckers have 
this because like half of the bits are 

1663
01:10:07,681 --> 01:10:11,551
about suicide bombing and fucking making
fun of osama bin ladin living in a cave.

1664
01:10:12,911 --> 01:10:13,900
I mean,
it's a lot of,

1665
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:14,770
a lot of them.

1666
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,790
Gee,
there's a lot of that in there.

1667
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:25,710
Some guy remix that jihad and made a 
terrible song out of it.

1668
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:29,430
I still think you need to work on your 
new song that you wrote in tempe.

1669
01:10:29,431 --> 01:10:33,210
I think that's a great song that he has 
a song.

1670
01:10:33,211 --> 01:10:35,220
That's.
Where was the Arizona?

1671
01:10:35,221 --> 01:10:36,690
That was number one.
Girls.

1672
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:37,900
Oh,
that song,

1673
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:39,900
that song?
Yeah,

1674
01:10:39,901 --> 01:10:44,901
that's what I was really popular.
But panini was like number one for like.

1675
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:50,090
Yeah,
it was number one for like a couple of 

1676
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:50,090
months because these guys,
tim and mark in,

1677
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:50,550
uh,
in phoenix.

1678
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:53,250
I love this guys there.
They don't work there anymore.

1679
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,100
Unfortunately.
If they got fired up,

1680
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,640
you probably don't know them.
You're thinking of something that,

1681
01:10:57,650 --> 01:11:02,650
you know,
the ones that we filmed the original a 

1682
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:02,730
dvd for like three years ago,
four years ago.

1683
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:04,710
Would they then.
Yeah,

1684
01:11:04,711 --> 01:11:07,140
I filmed something for later.
Well anyway,

1685
01:11:07,141 --> 01:11:08,760
these guys,
they started playing it.

1686
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:12,120
It's this cycle about pussy by booty 
pussy.

1687
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:14,040
It's called nanny.
But you can play

1688
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,090
it on the radio.
It's like,

1689
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:20,360
it's pretty clean.
It's all about any guy knows what this 

1690
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,090
is all about.
Like there are,

1691
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:23,550
there are girls' vaginas are not created
equal.

1692
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:25,020
They're just not,
you know.

1693
01:11:25,021 --> 01:11:27,210
And,
and sex is not equal either.

1694
01:11:27,211 --> 01:11:32,211
You,
you could have sex with one person and 

1695
01:11:32,211 --> 01:11:34,161
it's boring as fuck.
And then you can have sex with another 

1696
01:11:34,161 --> 01:11:36,681
chick and she's just a goddamn freak.
And every now and then you'll come 

1697
01:11:36,681 --> 01:11:39,000
across a girl who's a freak and she's 
got a super pussy and there are pussies.

1698
01:11:39,001 --> 01:11:40,160
They're super pussies.
Yeah.

1699
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:43,620
Where you,
you get into any like god damn.

1700
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,430
There was this one girl that I used to 
fuck and literally her,

1701
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,870
her pussy was like,
it was like velvet.

1702
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,000
There was something going on in there.
It was like,

1703
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:53,120
it just gripped your dick.
It was,

1704
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:54,420
she wasn't a small girl.

1705
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:58,620
She was tall,
but her pussy was super tight and always

1706
01:11:58,621 --> 01:11:59,520
wet.
And it was.

1707
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,430
And she was a,
just a total pervert,

1708
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:05,550
just a freak.
And literally it was like a drug.

1709
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:08,690
And I see,
I used to call it voodoo pussy.

1710
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:10,080
I'm like,
this page has got food pussy.

1711
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,330
So I had to write a song about udo 
pussy.

1712
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,600
So I wrote the song voodoo nanny,
which is one my 1999 and cd,

1713
01:12:17,911 --> 01:12:20,550
which is called a.
I'm going to be dead someday.

1714
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:21,900
So,
um,

1715
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,960
you know,
I've thought about writing another song.

1716
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,720
I might write something else if I found 
something.

1717
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:29,520
I like the new one,
the new one that you knew.

1718
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,470
It was pretty funny.

1719
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:36,070
Girl's butthole were high one night.
I just started singing that and they got

1720
01:12:36,071 --> 01:12:41,071
stuck in everybody's head and all night 
we were just walking around going to 

1721
01:12:41,071 --> 01:12:45,450
assume senior girl's butthole.
I can't tell you what the subjects.

1722
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,840
Why this came up is this dude that we 
know was dating this girl that does some

1723
01:12:52,571 --> 01:12:54,820
things where you might be able to see 
her butthole,

1724
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:56,840
like the whole world can see it.
It's funny.

1725
01:12:56,841 --> 01:12:58,300
So I like that guy now.
He's a good guy.

1726
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,310
He's a good dude.
I like that.

1727
01:12:59,390 --> 01:12:59,500
Dude.

1728
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:04,330
So you've been using your high tab a,
what's it called?

1729
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:05,470
Ipad a lot later.
Yeah.

1730
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:05,870
Yeah,
yeah,

1731
01:13:05,871 --> 01:13:07,810
definitely.
How has the battery life did you use it?

1732
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,400
Dominoes

1733
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,560
the whole way.
I didn't charge it once.

1734
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:15,710
I charged it right before I left,
but I was reading like with it every 

1735
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:15,940
day,
like reading in bed and uh,

1736
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,300
I was a watch.
I was surfing the web on it.

1737
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:20,310
I was doing all sorts of shit on it.
Man.

1738
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:25,380
I have a review I just did and I showed 
this new application that lets you take 

1739
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:27,280
your iphone and it bluetooths connects 
it to your ipad.

1740
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,340
It's like a wireless webcam.
I saw that,

1741
01:13:29,341 --> 01:13:31,080
but that's just like a shitty 
programming.

1742
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:33,750
Can you imagine if apple releases a.
Here's what.

1743
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:38,770
Here's my.
Here's my rumor what I think it's going 

1744
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:38,770
to be.
I just made this up last night.

1745
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:41,890
All right,
so they have the new iphone that comes 

1746
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:41,890
out in june.
They're going to next.

1747
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:45,100
There's all this room are going to have 
a front facing camera with it chat so 

1748
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:45,820
you can do I chat live video on your 
phone.

1749
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:50,970
So what?
I think they're waiting for that rumor 

1750
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:53,460
and they're going to release a bluetooth
hd camera that will snap on top of your 

1751
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:57,091
eye tab and do the same thing.
So you can have like a little wireless 

1752
01:13:57,091 --> 01:13:57,091
camera.

1753
01:13:57,091 --> 01:13:58,250
Why don't they just have a camera built 
this saturday?

1754
01:13:58,251 --> 01:14:03,251
Well I have to hit some bluetooth thing 
that's gay because in the bluetooth 

1755
01:14:03,251 --> 01:14:03,251
going to run out of batteries and how's 
it going?

1756
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:04,400
I'm going to have to charge it.
That's.

1757
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:06,110
Well,
there should be an iphone camera.

1758
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:08,420
Why don't you make a camera in there?
I think they're going to happen.

1759
01:14:08,421 --> 01:14:10,250
I think it's going to be like a $300 
camera.

1760
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:12,330
I think it's gonna be like hd,
like high quality.

1761
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:13,550
Just making this up.
Well,

1762
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,590
I am not going to sell it.

1763
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:15,970
This is definitely those.
Jesus,

1764
01:14:15,971 --> 01:14:20,971
this is going to go back in time.
Can go back in time with that and it'll 

1765
01:14:22,451 --> 01:14:23,550
suck your dick while you take a.

1766
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:28,780
That was awesome.
That program alone just kind of made me 

1767
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:28,780
go,
you know what?

1768
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:28,780
Something like this is coming.

1769
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:30,020
That's what's gonna happen.
Eventually,

1770
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,350
eventually it's going to be like a 
portal to another dimension.

1771
01:14:33,351 --> 01:14:35,000
There'll be a mouth on the other 
dimension.

1772
01:14:35,001 --> 01:14:40,001
You get a hard on and you put the ipad 
and your dick goes right through the 

1773
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:40,001
ipad to someone's mouth.

1774
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:44,140
Another know in another dimension to 
pull your ipad out.

1775
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:49,790
What if it crashes?
Halfway through dick is stuck in the 

1776
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:54,050
fucking 11,
just floating around with it.

1777
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:59,720
Special episode of oprah winfrey.
Gods who lost half their dick into 

1778
01:14:59,720 --> 01:14:59,720
another dimension.
Maybe one dude is like,

1779
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,480
I only lost the tip.
I was just about to put it in.

1780
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:04,370
We had a power outage.
It was just about,

1781
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:07,190
I guess it was some sort of a solar 
flare and so now,

1782
01:15:07,191 --> 01:15:08,320
I mean had the top of my degree

1783
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:13,360
is flat.
It's kind of a novelty goes into like a 

1784
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,480
beer can.
He doesn't have a head.

1785
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,360
It doesn't have a curve to it.
Just think flat.

1786
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:23,110
Yeah.
Who knows what the fuck is coming up 

1787
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:23,110
next man.
There's gonna be some crazy shit though.

1788
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:23,110
It's gonna.
It's gonna.

1789
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:25,070
Keep going.
They're going to keep inventing more and

1790
01:15:25,071 --> 01:15:28,010
more nutty shit and like I said before,
I think that it's all it.

1791
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:33,080
Everything has to do with connectivity.
Everything has to do with bringing 

1792
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,850
people closer and closer together.
That's what this whole tiger woods thing

1793
01:15:34,851 --> 01:15:37,190
is all about.
That this would not have happened 30,

1794
01:15:37,191 --> 01:15:42,191
40 years ago because there wouldn't be 
the kind of connectivity that people 

1795
01:15:42,191 --> 01:15:42,360
have now with the internet.
The internet keeps.

1796
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:43,540
It's getting worse and worse.
Man,

1797
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:48,070
did you hear what else has came out the 
other day that a fucking oprah winfrey.

1798
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:49,410
Oprah winfrey?
Yeah,

1799
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:53,530
it's Jesse James.
It's going to consist jim carrey,

1800
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,760
a good a whole article on this whole 
thing on gizmodo or mondo or whatever 

1801
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,230
it's called,
dot com.

1802
01:15:59,231 --> 01:16:04,231
Moan about celebrities ruined.
Enter careers from twitter and all that 

1803
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:07,120
stuff because there's too much 
information is getting out and you know,

1804
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:08,200
it's crazy.

1805
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:10,710
That is a good point because a lot of 
celebrities,

1806
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:13,980
really the illusion is way better than 
who they are.

1807
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:14,570
Oh yeah.
You know,

1808
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,140
you get to know them.
You know,

1809
01:16:16,141 --> 01:16:17,490
like it's.
It is a trick,

1810
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,580
you know,
most other sports in niggers,

1811
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:24,590
a trick obviously you know how few 
actors would ever want to do something 

1812
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:26,380
like this.
Fuck if they did that because look,

1813
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:27,930
look at us.
There's no makeup.

1814
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,850
We're just fucking hanging on my office.
Look,

1815
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,500
I'm a fucking slob.
That's all my shit.

1816
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,670
I'm cleaning out my office.
This is my,

1817
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:38,690
my new desk is behind me.
I bought this fucking desk a year ago 

1818
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:39,210
and I still have not set it up yet.
The desk did.

1819
01:16:39,211 --> 01:16:41,580
Everything's on right now is too big,
so this desk,

1820
01:16:41,581 --> 01:16:45,990
I'm getting rid of a moving that desk in
the place and that wall is going to be a

1821
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:51,020
green screen.
I always buy things and it's always in 

1822
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:54,520
plastics.
You have so many things that you've 

1823
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:54,520
never even know.
Well,

1824
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,981
I am what,
what you would be like if you were 12 

1825
01:16:57,981 --> 01:16:57,981
years old and all of a sudden you had 
money to.

1826
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:02,010
Somebody just gave you free money.
Just buy stupid shit.

1827
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,900
But this,
I have this because um,

1828
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:05,370
I think that,
um,

1829
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,350
I think a lot of things up in my car and
I don't want to be fiddling around.

1830
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:14,150
I just want to push a button so I got a 
digital recorder when I drive,

1831
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:15,080
I come up.
Do you drive?

1832
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,190
You come up with ideas where you drive?
Yeah,

1833
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:17,580
I do.

1834
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:22,730
But you know what's funny is I,
we talked about this last week to the 

1835
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:23,730
point where like I have to get my words 
out as quick as possible.

1836
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:29,060
It happened to me like two days after 
that I had thought of this hilarious 

1837
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:29,060
thing about metallica.
Pete,

1838
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:29,910
we're talking about metallica and I'm 
like,

1839
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:31,160
oh,
I get my iphone out,

1840
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:32,370
got my iphone out,
and somebody says,

1841
01:17:32,371 --> 01:17:32,850
hey brian.
I'm like,

1842
01:17:32,851 --> 01:17:34,280
oh hey,
fuck.

1843
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:36,060
Lost it.
You don't even remember what it is.

1844
01:17:36,061 --> 01:17:37,230
I've been trying to think about it all 
time.

1845
01:17:37,231 --> 01:17:39,180
Was so fucking funny though.
I can't even remember it.

1846
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:44,460
Yeah,
it's when someone's talking to you and 

1847
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:44,460
you have an idea,
you can totally lose it.

1848
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,970
Like I'll get ideas.
Awesome.

1849
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:49,020
I will cover my ears and run away from 
like,

1850
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:50,950
what the fuck is wrong with you?
Man?

1851
01:17:50,951 --> 01:17:55,951
You're fucking rude.
Then I have to come back and explain to 

1852
01:17:55,951 --> 01:17:58,471
them I'm so sorry.
I had an idea and it was super 

1853
01:17:58,471 --> 01:17:59,790
important.
But for me any idea like that is like,

1854
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:04,830
those are diamonds.
Like there's ideas that have come up 

1855
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:04,830
with like,
you know,

1856
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:05,530
that became bits,
you know,

1857
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:08,730
that those pits are so valuable to me,
you know,

1858
01:18:08,731 --> 01:18:09,190
like,
like,

1859
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:11,440
like my Anna Nicole Smith bed or 
something like that.

1860
01:18:11,441 --> 01:18:13,210
Like some of the classic bits that I had
in the past.

1861
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:14,980
What if,
as I was thinking that up,

1862
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:17,770
somebody came up to me and started 
talking about their stupid bullshit,

1863
01:18:17,771 --> 01:18:22,771
right?
Because some people are fucking brutal 

1864
01:18:22,771 --> 01:18:25,141
and they don't take the hint ever.
Like they just want to say what they 

1865
01:18:25,141 --> 01:18:25,150
have to say to you.
You can't say,

1866
01:18:25,151 --> 01:18:26,200
can you hold on,
hold on a second.

1867
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:27,280
They'll just keep talking.

1868
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:28,850
Hold on a second dude,
stop.

1869
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:30,570
Fuck,
fuck.

1870
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,920
And then I was watching the ufc next to 
a guidance.

1871
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:36,860
I just met with a friend of a friend,
but the whole fight,

1872
01:18:36,861 --> 01:18:41,060
he sounded like a reporter from the 19 
twenties talking to dick tracy.

1873
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:42,870
It's like that.
Anything about that yet.

1874
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,900
So when you think about that,
I'm like,

1875
01:18:44,901 --> 01:18:45,990
even talk like that.
He's,

1876
01:18:45,991 --> 01:18:47,860
that's funny thing about his legs.
I think as long as I can.

1877
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:49,070
And I'm just like,
oh,

1878
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:53,790
shut the fuck.
We're like,

1879
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:57,720
I hate when people don't have that 
quality of self evaluated.

1880
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,800
You know what I mean?
That just drives me crazy when I meet 

1881
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:02,800
somebody that does.

1882
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:02,800
How important is that?
Uh,

1883
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:06,220
we know a lot of people that don't have 
that quality.

1884
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:08,920
We know a lot of people,
most people don't have that quality.

1885
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:11,800
It's a bad quality,
but in the usually the people at this is

1886
01:19:11,801 --> 01:19:16,801
another thing that people don't have 
that quality are usually not successful 

1887
01:19:16,801 --> 01:19:17,360
and it's one of the reasons why they're 
not successful is there.

1888
01:19:17,361 --> 01:19:22,361
There's a.
There's a disconnect between them and 

1889
01:19:22,361 --> 01:19:25,651
other people.
Other people do not see them the way 

1890
01:19:25,651 --> 01:19:28,180
everybody else does or them the way 
rather they see themselves,

1891
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:33,181
they see themselves like completely 
distorted and that's why they haven't 

1892
01:19:33,181 --> 01:19:36,421
been successful.
They're not being objective because 

1893
01:19:36,421 --> 01:19:37,000
objectivity requires pain.
You know?

1894
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,500
No one's perfect.
Okay.

1895
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:41,530
Especially when you're younger,
if you're not making mistakes,

1896
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,060
you're not trying.
If you're not trying,

1897
01:19:43,061 --> 01:19:44,440
you're not going to get better at 
anything you do.

1898
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:45,250
You're gonna fuck up.

1899
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:47,170
You're going to make horrible mistakes.
I mean,

1900
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:52,380
one of the reasons I got good at standup
is because being bad at standup is so 

1901
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:52,380
fucking painful,
you know,

1902
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:57,211
and the only way you got to find that 
out by getting in front of people and 

1903
01:19:57,211 --> 01:19:58,060
having them hate you,
having them not laugh and believe,

1904
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,460
well a lot of people don't have an 
audience in their life.

1905
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:05,490
They don't have anything to evaluate 
themselves with so they don't evaluate 

1906
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:08,821
themselves.
So they have this distorted perception 

1907
01:20:08,821 --> 01:20:09,030
of how cool you are.
That's with guys and drinking.

1908
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,440
That's the most painful.

1909
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,510
The mouse drinking.
Yeah.

1910
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:14,940
It's your worst.
And I've been,

1911
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:15,750
I,
I made it,

1912
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:20,751
I've done it before,
but I've also like the next day slapped 

1913
01:20:20,751 --> 01:20:20,751
my forehead going,
okay,

1914
01:20:20,751 --> 01:20:22,770
next time I drink I got to remember that
I do that.

1915
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:23,670
I need,
you know,

1916
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:24,990
I've.
But there's some people,

1917
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:27,210
it's supposed to guys get really close 
in your face when they're drunk.

1918
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:33,220
Some dude did that in and other job and 
he kept telling me that he was some 

1919
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:35,970
prince's cousin and this and that.
And then men,

1920
01:20:35,971 --> 01:20:37,890
you come with me,
all the bitches,

1921
01:20:37,891 --> 01:20:38,790
man.
Come on,

1922
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:40,590
man.
We're going to do business together,

1923
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:42,300
you know,
it was you and I are going to open up.

1924
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:45,040
I like to get the fuck away from me.
You're,

1925
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:49,900
you're spitting in my ear,
man,

1926
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,190
and telling me how we're going to go 
into business together in dubai and like

1927
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,920
get the fuck out of here man.

1928
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:59,130
We're not going into business together.
It's chicken.

1929
01:20:59,131 --> 01:21:04,131
My Mike Young used to do a joke about 
that was one of my favorite bits about 

1930
01:21:04,131 --> 01:21:06,540
how everybody does coke wants to open up
a business with you because it's totally

1931
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:08,250
true.
When dudes do coke,

1932
01:21:08,251 --> 01:21:10,880
they always have business plans because 
they have all kinds of plants.

1933
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:13,800
All kinds of,
oh,

1934
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:17,850
coke is the worst drug in the world.
Is the worst drugs ever been created?

1935
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:23,140
It is the number one retailer drug.
There's no better when you're out and 

1936
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:24,880
you're surrounded by a bunch of coke 
cans and they're just talking out.

1937
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:28,080
Know the worst is when you're high and 
they're cooked up.

1938
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:31,710
Is there ever a worse combination?
There's no worse combination.

1939
01:21:31,711 --> 01:21:36,711
Then when you're stoned and you're 
hanging around coke heads because stone 

1940
01:21:36,711 --> 01:21:38,340
is like you're timid and you're humble.
You know,

1941
01:21:38,341 --> 01:21:39,660
when you,
when you smoke pot,

1942
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:40,950
you all,
you start realizing like,

1943
01:21:40,951 --> 01:21:43,470
god,
I'm like this fleshy little thing.

1944
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,420
You know,
like if there's a line in this room,

1945
01:21:45,421 --> 01:21:47,520
that line can just eat me.
There's nothing I can do about it.

1946
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:49,880
When you're coked up,
you never think about a lion.

1947
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:55,210
If you do like a little fucking line to 
that line of something like grade math 

1948
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:57,600
is the worst somebody put on there also.
Yeah,

1949
01:21:57,601 --> 01:22:00,360
I agree with math.
I wonder how many people.

1950
01:22:00,361 --> 01:22:01,890
Yeah,
robin williams was a coke addict.

1951
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,260
I wonder how many people,

1952
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:08,610
um,
but that I've been around have been on 

1953
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:08,610
methadone.
I didn't know it.

1954
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:11,190
I bet a lot.
La man,

1955
01:22:11,191 --> 01:22:16,191
there's a lot.
Half the people that we think are 

1956
01:22:16,191 --> 01:22:17,110
fucking crazy or just on math.
A lot of people

1957
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:18,010
are messed up,
man.

1958
01:22:18,011 --> 01:22:19,990
That is definitely true.
A lot of people that are like,

1959
01:22:19,991 --> 01:22:24,991
when you see people that are real skinny
and drawn out and they're fucking 

1960
01:22:24,991 --> 01:22:24,991
talking wacky.
It's something.

1961
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:26,950
What is it?
It's some sort of amphetamines,

1962
01:22:26,951 --> 01:22:31,951
whether it's math or do you know that 
meth was invented during world war one 

1963
01:22:31,951 --> 01:22:34,510
and world war two,
the japanese used it for the,

1964
01:22:34,511 --> 01:22:36,190
um,
for suicide bombers.

1965
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:41,310
That's how they talked to kamikaze.
He's into fucking crashing planes into 

1966
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:41,310
boats.
Yeah,

1967
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,400
they would.
They would hook them up with meth.

1968
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:43,710
Nice.
Yeah.

1969
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:48,780
That's cool.
Not only the government is not only 

1970
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:48,780
experimented with that.
I mean they've done.

1971
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:52,500
The japanese government gave them 
amphetamines and crystal meth and shit 

1972
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,710
like that.
But I'm also steroids.

1973
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,990
The United States government has done 
that in the past.

1974
01:22:55,991 --> 01:22:59,410
Like soldiers have told,
been told that they have to take certain

1975
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:00,940
pills,
you have to take things.

1976
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:03,070
And when you take them finance,
like anna bar,

1977
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:06,130
which is an oral steroid,
super hyper

1978
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,710
aggressive,
which totally makes sense.

1979
01:23:07,711 --> 01:23:09,490
Yeah.
And when guys are juiced up,

1980
01:23:09,491 --> 01:23:11,140
if guys were all juiced out there 
fucking,

1981
01:23:11,141 --> 01:23:12,640
they feel like they're invincible.
You're,

1982
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,500
your body's all flooded with 
testosterone.

1983
01:23:14,501 --> 01:23:16,900
Like gorillas must feel completely 
invincible.

1984
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,000
You know,
when you're just fucking,

1985
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:20,050
you know,
you're living in the woods,

1986
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:22,090
you're covered in hair,
you weigh 800 pounds.

1987
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:27,330
They don't worry about shit.
Take a totally beat a fighter by the 

1988
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:27,330
way.
Gorilla is versus a person.

1989
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:27,940
Oh,
crusher person.

1990
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:29,910
No,
I mean a person who would be the gorilla

1991
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:35,300
beat eddie.
Eddie was trying to make some crazy 

1992
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:35,780
argument that it was people that could 
be the champion.

1993
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:36,880
A fight.
I'm like,

1994
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:40,840
what the fuck it ship would just bite 
your fingers off.

1995
01:23:40,841 --> 01:23:43,630
That's the first thing he would do.
Now try fighting stupid.

1996
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:44,950
Oh,
you're punching him in the head.

1997
01:23:44,951 --> 01:23:49,951
Good.
He's grabbing it and eating your 

1998
01:23:49,951 --> 01:23:49,951
fingers.

1999
01:23:49,951 --> 01:23:49,951
So once you all have your fingers are 
gone,

2000
01:23:49,951 --> 01:23:51,370
then he's going to look at you and go,
now what?

2001
01:23:51,371 --> 01:23:56,371
Bitch?
Now I'm going to eat your asshole and 

2002
01:23:56,371 --> 01:23:56,371
it'll dive onto your asshole.
It was.

2003
01:23:56,371 --> 01:23:59,600
Wait till it gets close to your bundle 
and you'll be fighting them off where he

2004
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:00,790
get.
Keep getting in there.

2005
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:02,710
I thought eddie was joking the whole 
time,

2006
01:24:02,711 --> 01:24:05,490
but I don't think he was drunk.
Not drunk at ease.

2007
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:06,910
You know?
Drunk getting drunk.

2008
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:08,230
Drunk.
He was drunk.

2009
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:13,280
Yeah.
Sees three drinks and three drinks and 

2010
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:13,280
this drunk eddie.
What?

2011
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,740
Support that Jack Daniels.
The lights went out in Georgia,

2012
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:17,680
fucking drum started playing.
The indian came out.

2013
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:25,710
So what brock would destroy gorilla.
Could you imagine what a girl would do 

2014
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:26,780
to progress?
You know,

2015
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:32,180
just come charging across.
I'm just.

2016
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:37,240
He knows he can't fucking be extra long.
You ever seen a gorilla Russia person?

2017
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:42,390
It's so goddamn terrifying.
They rush you and they hope that you're 

2018
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:44,710
just going to back off and get away and 
they just want to claim your territory,

2019
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,430
but if you do turn and run,
they might just freak out.

2020
01:24:48,431 --> 01:24:51,980
Just chase you and beat the fuck out of 
you so you have to turn away and yet,

2021
01:24:51,981 --> 01:24:56,560
but you have to stand down,
but you can't look like prey to chimps,

2022
01:24:56,590 --> 01:25:01,330
chimps and gorillas and we there are so 
strong we couldn't even imagine.

2023
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:03,940
You couldn't even wrap your head around 
what they could do to you.

2024
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:08,860
They could literally grab you by the arm
and throw you throw you.

2025
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:13,000
They would pull your arm literally right
off your body like no problem.

2026
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:14,740
A pit bull and killed those people.

2027
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:18,340
Hippo.
That's a dog.

2028
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:23,370
You remember frank have frank.
I always used to think that if this dog 

2029
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:23,470
wanted to,
he could kill me.

2030
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:29,010
He could kill anything.
Fucking 90 pound pit bull with his big 

2031
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:29,080
fire hydrant head.
If he wanted to,

2032
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:30,360
he would kill me.
You know,

2033
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:31,690
he doesn't know that.
That's why,

2034
01:25:31,691 --> 01:25:32,620
you know,
I have no food.

2035
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:37,180
That's why I like being around animals 
that can't kill me.

2036
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,300
Make an only love.
Yeah.

2037
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:41,500
Like little kitty cat,
kitty cats.

2038
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:43,090
So what do you think about the steven 
seagal?

2039
01:25:43,091 --> 01:25:43,900
Thanks.
Steven seagal.

2040
01:25:43,901 --> 01:25:46,840
Got arrested or didn't get arrested?
He's getting sued.

2041
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:52,170
Let's find a story right here.
Because what happened was apparently he 

2042
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:53,470
had some chick that was working for him 
and she was his.

2043
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:56,000
She was his,
um,

2044
01:25:56,260 --> 01:26:00,640
he's sued for trafficking women and 
sexual assault trafficking women.

2045
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,950
The woman was a former model and she was
hired the actor

2046
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,590
as his executive assistant last 
february.

2047
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:08,090
This was on tmz.
So you know,

2048
01:26:08,091 --> 01:26:08,960
it's real.
Mr.

2049
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:14,050
Seagal had been keeping to young female 
russian attendance on staff who were 

2050
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:17,300
available for his sexual desires 24 
hours a day,

2051
01:26:17,301 --> 01:26:22,301
seven days a week.
So apparently one of the assistants quit

2052
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:26,630
and seagal apparently only roles with 
threesomes.

2053
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,260
So he made his uh,
he made his assistant,

2054
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:33,170
starts laughing.
He's like,

2055
01:26:33,171 --> 01:26:36,260
I need more than one.
He had two hookers that were working for

2056
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:41,261
him.
Twenty four slash seven and one of them 

2057
01:26:41,261 --> 01:26:41,520
probably met some rich dude somewhere 
and got a better job.

2058
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:44,330
Fuck a cigar.
That much money tv show now.

2059
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:45,980
Yeah.
But that's not shit.

2060
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:47,160
He's done a lot of,
oh,

2061
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:49,580
he's making money off that show.
It makes the star.

2062
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:54,650
I guarantee you it makes a few hundred 
thousand dollars a year for sure off 

2063
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:54,650
that show.
Maybe half a million,

2064
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:56,000
maybe more because he's a big star.

2065
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:57,500
He might make a million a year off that 
show.

2066
01:26:57,530 --> 01:27:02,530
They might've given them a big deal.
It might make more than a million a 

2067
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:02,530
year.
So he's got that.

2068
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:02,660
Okay.
Then he's got.

2069
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:05,480
How many movies did he do?
He did a lot of goddamn movie.

2070
01:27:05,481 --> 01:27:10,010
So you got divorced in 1996.
So everything from 1996 until now.

2071
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:13,130
It's all his money.
I bet he's got a lot of money.

2072
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:18,400
I bet he's got a ton of money.
It's money doesn't seem smart with his 

2073
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,371
money.
It seems like it's spinosa money on 

2074
01:27:21,371 --> 01:27:21,371
ponytail,
ponytail,

2075
01:27:21,371 --> 01:27:22,740
juice,
juice.

2076
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:25,340
What does that even mean?
Conditioner.

2077
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:27,980
How much has conditioner and he's got 
good conditioning.

2078
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:31,040
He's um,
I mean he's,

2079
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:33,860
he's still a big star in those foreign 
movies,

2080
01:27:33,861 --> 01:27:38,861
like straight to video,
dvd sales because he could still sell a 

2081
01:27:38,861 --> 01:27:38,861
steven seagal movie,
you know,

2082
01:27:38,861 --> 01:27:41,610
you make it for cheap money and you sell
it fairly cheap and they,

2083
01:27:41,611 --> 01:27:43,490
you know,
the air it on cable at 3:00

2084
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,590
in the morning and they sell them on 
dvds.

2085
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:50,990
There's still some money in that.
But like when I said was when I was in 

2086
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:51,950
a,
uh,

2087
01:27:51,951 --> 01:27:53,660
abu dhabi,
when you go to dubai,

2088
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:56,030
dubai's flooded with hookers and there's
hookers,

2089
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,020
airways,
russian hookers.

2090
01:27:57,410 --> 01:28:02,410
So apparently there's a lot of them.
So it's not outside the realm of 

2091
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:06,611
possibility that some actor,
we just hired two of them like to be on 

2092
01:28:06,611 --> 01:28:06,611
call 24 slash seven.
Right.

2093
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:08,960
I think it's,
I mean,

2094
01:28:08,961 --> 01:28:10,190
look,
if that's how you want to roll,

2095
01:28:10,191 --> 01:28:11,780
I think that's a pimp move.
I mean,

2096
01:28:11,781 --> 01:28:13,610
the dude's not even fucking married,
right?

2097
01:28:13,611 --> 01:28:15,020
You use,
you can't really criticize it.

2098
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:16,940
I mean,
you can criticize the fact that he's a,

2099
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:19,160
you know,
he's hiring prostitutes,

2100
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,230
but let's be honest,
what the fuck is,

2101
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:22,760
you know,
a lot of rich guys,

2102
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:23,610
wives,
what,

2103
01:28:23,611 --> 01:28:25,340
what are they,
you know,

2104
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:26,830
are they really attracted to them?
Is,

2105
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,040
I mean,
it's tiger woods wife.

2106
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,940
Does she really think he's hot,
you know,

2107
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,720
or do you think he's hot because he's 
rich?

2108
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:37,870
You know,
how many of them think he's hot because 

2109
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:40,151
he's rich?
How many super goofy looking dudes that 

2110
01:28:40,151 --> 01:28:41,390
are multibillionaires who have these 
model wives.

2111
01:28:41,391 --> 01:28:45,130
He's super fucking hot wise.
What's going on there?

2112
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:46,400
You know,
Donald Trump,

2113
01:28:46,401 --> 01:28:48,500
you ever see donald trump's wife hot as 
fuck.

2114
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:53,650
Yeah,
he's a powerful man and all that good 

2115
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:53,650
stuff and they're attracted to that and 
security and all that good stuff.

2116
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:56,000
But at the end of the day,
he is rich.

2117
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:57,530
They're hot,
he's ugly.

2118
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:59,430
What's going on there?
I mean,

2119
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:01,530
this is a form of prostitution,
right?

2120
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,080
It really is.
Yeah.

2121
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:08,240
I mean,
what's the sexual prostitution is the 

2122
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:08,240
whole difference?
Is that in sexual prostitution?

2123
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,120
So apparently,
you know,

2124
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:12,270
the idea is that it's not good because 
there's no love,

2125
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:14,520
there's no real emotions,
no relationship,

2126
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,070
you know,
it's just sex for money.

2127
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:22,460
But like what if you like data girl and 
you actually enjoy her company and need 

2128
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,620
your time and you like her and you say,
listen,

2129
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:28,230
you have a shitty job and I have a lot 
of money.

2130
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:33,290
How about you quit your job and I pay 
you a thousand dollars a week and this 

2131
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:36,621
is what you have to do.
You just have to suck my dick anytime I 

2132
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:36,621
want.
I mean,

2133
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:36,621
you already liked to do it anyway,
right?

2134
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:37,800
Well let's just make it sort of a job.
Okay.

2135
01:29:37,801 --> 01:29:40,290
And you'll get a check every week.
But I don't wanna hear any argument from

2136
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:40,350
me.

2137
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:43,320
I think that'd be cool for like a year.
But I think after that,

2138
01:29:43,321 --> 01:29:44,060
I don't know,
man,

2139
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,620
it's just,
I,

2140
01:29:44,621 --> 01:29:46,830
I can see myself doing that if I had a 
lot of money.

2141
01:29:46,831 --> 01:29:51,831
But women would think that it's 
demoralizing and it would be the exact 

2142
01:29:51,831 --> 01:29:52,740
opposite of a,
you know,

2143
01:29:52,741 --> 01:29:53,430
why?
Uh,

2144
01:29:53,431 --> 01:29:56,100
why pay for the cow when the milk is 
free?

2145
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:58,350
Right will be the exact opposite.
It would be like,

2146
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,640
look,
I know I'm getting free melt,

2147
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:01,620
but I would rather pay for the cow and 
have that fucking cow.

2148
01:30:01,621 --> 01:30:06,621
Give me anytime I want with no argument.
I don't want to get up at four in the 

2149
01:30:06,621 --> 01:30:09,951
morning.
Go to milk you when you start 

2150
01:30:09,951 --> 01:30:09,951
complaining.
Listen,

2151
01:30:09,951 --> 01:30:12,141
I'm going to pay you right now.
And this is what happens with our 

2152
01:30:12,141 --> 01:30:12,900
relationship now is we're still friends.
I still love you were boyfriend,

2153
01:30:12,901 --> 01:30:15,750
girlfriend,
but I do whatever I want and you suck my

2154
01:30:15,751 --> 01:30:16,440
dick whenever asked.

2155
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:19,470
Now you got the bank.
Does that process but yeah.

2156
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:20,490
That.
Is that illegal?

2157
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:22,030
No.
Is that illegal?

2158
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:25,140
I would say it's illegal,
but I would say that's not illegal.

2159
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,470
If you say it is it,
is it on your tax forms?

2160
01:30:28,471 --> 01:30:29,340
I'm,
you know,

2161
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:31,970
brian reichles paid hooker.
You,

2162
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:33,150
you go to jail.
Yeah,

2163
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:34,390
that's illegal.
Yeah.

2164
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:37,950
Say if you had a check to do it right,
you know,

2165
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:42,960
you'd have to write it down.
Mean look if you had a girl and she was 

2166
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,460
a multimillionaire and say if you were a
carpenter.

2167
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:45,920
Okay.
And uh,

2168
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:46,680
you know,
this is your,

2169
01:30:46,681 --> 01:30:47,180
you know,
you,

2170
01:30:47,181 --> 01:30:52,181
you've met her and you used to do some 
shit around her house when you first 

2171
01:30:52,181 --> 01:30:55,101
started dating her and you know,
you do a little carpentry here and 

2172
01:30:55,101 --> 01:30:55,101
there,
but he did it for free because you loved

2173
01:30:55,101 --> 01:30:55,950
her.
And then all of a sudden she said,

2174
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:57,990
listen,
you don't like your job.

2175
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,910
Why don't you just come from me,
work for me.

2176
01:30:59,911 --> 01:31:02,670
You'll be my carpenter and you just do 
whatever I want to do whenever you want.

2177
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:04,350
But the only difference is now a pay 
you.

2178
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,890
What is the difference between that and 
sucking your dick is very,

2179
01:31:07,891 --> 01:31:09,240
very little difference,
right?

2180
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:14,450
If you have a chance and she's working 
for you and she just gets paid to blow 

2181
01:31:14,450 --> 01:31:15,330
you,
but she used to blow you for free.

2182
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,000
But now she blows you because it's her 
job because you pair,

2183
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:19,140
right?
Is that bad?

2184
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:20,910
No.
Especially if you make it.

2185
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:24,360
Let her just let her make her dress up 
an outfit.

2186
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,810
The old girl only giving my only whore.
You.

2187
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:34,990
I only have one.
It's only you and I don't fucking the 

2188
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:34,990
other girl.
I would hate,

2189
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:35,250
I would hate that.
I would hate,

2190
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,920
hate,
hate,

2191
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:38,490
I,
you know,

2192
01:31:38,491 --> 01:31:43,491
because I think the purpose,
my purpose was always finding somebody 

2193
01:31:43,491 --> 01:31:47,241
that would want to fuck me that much 
without any questions asked in that I 

2194
01:31:47,241 --> 01:31:47,550
would want to fuck that first that I 
didn't give you.

2195
01:31:47,551 --> 01:31:51,570
This chick likes my logic eve pull.
She likes the logic.

2196
01:31:51,950 --> 01:31:53,970
That's a dude.
Sexuality has been immoral.

2197
01:31:53,971 --> 01:31:54,930
Uh,
yeah.

2198
01:31:54,931 --> 01:31:56,290
It might be a dude,
right?

2199
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,170
Sexual has been a more or less,
you know,

2200
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:04,410
I went to whack off last night.
I'm like this hand smiling.

2201
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:07,810
It was like a 2:00
in the morning.

2202
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,620
My wife is super pregnant right now and 
I can't fuck her on her belly.

2203
01:32:11,621 --> 01:32:13,180
I mean,
I do if she asks,

2204
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:13,950
but I,
I don't,

2205
01:32:13,951 --> 01:32:16,150
I don't want to impose myself on her.

2206
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:21,150
I felt rude.
I mean she's all pregnant like she's 

2207
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:21,150
ready to pop.
And um,

2208
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:22,150
so anyway,
I'm making excuses for why beat off,

2209
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:26,230
beat off.
But that's the reality of it.

2210
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:29,970
I really do feel bad anyway.
I go online to go,

2211
01:32:29,971 --> 01:32:34,971
whoa,
look at some porn and everything on one 

2212
01:32:34,971 --> 01:32:39,631
of my favorite sites is all fucking 
spitting in the mouth and gagging and 

2213
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,040
girls getting their faces fucked with 
it,

2214
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:47,041
like halfway throw it up and ate that.
Tears are coming out of their eyes and 

2215
01:32:47,041 --> 01:32:49,510
the guy smack it on the face with his 
dick and he said,

2216
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:50,320
you look like.

2217
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:57,360
And he's like,
fucking like spit and slobber she's 

2218
01:32:57,551 --> 01:32:59,080
coughing and spits,
coming out.

2219
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:00,010
And I'm like,
okay,

2220
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:02,350
I don't like this,
this is not fun.

2221
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,630
And then in the same,
uh,

2222
01:33:04,631 --> 01:33:09,631
the same series,
like there was another girl or the same 

2223
01:33:09,631 --> 01:33:11,260
girl rather than have like a bunch of 
videos by this girl named sasha gray,

2224
01:33:11,261 --> 01:33:12,550
who was the girl,
another one.

2225
01:33:12,551 --> 01:33:15,400
These guys are just violently fucking 
her ass.

2226
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:20,580
And then shoving it in her mouth and 
finally fucking around and I'm looking 

2227
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:22,300
at this and I'm like,
what is going on?

2228
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:24,550
Like,
who is liking all this?

2229
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:29,670
Like mad dog porn?
It's like you've got a mad dog bitches 

2230
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:30,250
in porn now.
Nobody just fucks anymore.

2231
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:31,690
It used to be,
you know,

2232
01:33:31,691 --> 01:33:35,430
a guy who orders a pizza and the chick 
shows up delivering the pizza.

2233
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:36,820
She needs to get changed.
Hate that.

2234
01:33:36,821 --> 01:33:40,450
She drops a dollar and she picks it up 
and the guy says nice and the girl says,

2235
01:33:40,451 --> 01:33:41,050
you think so?

2236
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:43,180
We see the whole thing and then she 
pulls her pants down.

2237
01:33:43,181 --> 01:33:46,090
Next thing you know their bone and 
that's the good old days.

2238
01:33:46,091 --> 01:33:48,280
That's fun.
That's good times.

2239
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:52,330
What does this mouth fucking tears 
rolling down people's face?

2240
01:33:52,331 --> 01:33:55,180
Spitting in people's mouths to dixon 
assholes.

2241
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:59,910
Like what's hilarious is that I've never
seen a porn website where it's just like

2242
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,000
it's people making love,
just being patched in it and stuff like 

2243
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:05,880
that.
Yeah,

2244
01:34:05,881 --> 01:34:08,030
there's no.
There's no teasing.

2245
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:13,580
Just fuck my ass.
One girl guys fucking her asshole.

2246
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:19,320
One guy was on top.
He was squatting on top and the other 

2247
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,910
guy was laying on his back and his dick 
was in and the other guy was in and it's

2248
01:34:21,911 --> 01:34:26,911
like that joke that I say about like,
you're not even having sex with a woman 

2249
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:29,851
at that point,
you're just using her vagina as a 

2250
01:34:29,851 --> 01:34:30,970
container so that you could rub dicks.
That is really what they were doing.

2251
01:34:30,971 --> 01:34:33,370
They were like,
they're two dicks to her.

2252
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:38,460
Her butthole was a holder for dick's.
Dick's while the plowing this girl's 

2253
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:41,230
asshole.
I mean,

2254
01:34:41,231 --> 01:34:44,140
think about to dick's,
even like two average sized dicks that's

2255
01:34:44,141 --> 01:34:46,300
stretching your butthole out till like 
that big.

2256
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:51,330
That's ridiculous.
Who wants to see them once and then the 

2257
01:34:51,330 --> 01:34:52,500
other guy spit in her mouth and they're 
fucking her mouth.

2258
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:53,740
I'm like,
jesus,

2259
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:55,750
sasha.
Greg,

2260
01:34:55,751 --> 01:34:57,640
get smacked in the face a lot too,
just

2261
01:34:58,230 --> 01:34:59,370
because I'm done with all that kind of 
thing.

2262
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:00,920
I just like.
I like homemade stuff.

2263
01:35:00,921 --> 01:35:05,921
I think we've talked about this.
You liked thinking that that's really 

2264
01:35:05,921 --> 01:35:06,490
you and this girl is really blowing 
real.

2265
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,320
Like I want to see people having real 
sexy,

2266
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,940
really attracted to it.
They're having real orgasms.

2267
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:11,570
They're,
you know,

2268
01:35:11,571 --> 01:35:13,910
there's really moaning because they're 
moaning,

2269
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,690
not definitely something to that man.
It's painful

2270
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:18,060
or you know,
paint like,

2271
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:23,240
and you know,
apparently the porn business is rough 

2272
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:23,240
now because of the fact that all this 
shit's online.

2273
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,710
It's very difficult to,
to like get money for porn.

2274
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:28,470
So these girls get tricked.
It's just like,

2275
01:35:28,471 --> 01:35:29,580
you know,
how you hear about the,

2276
01:35:29,581 --> 01:35:34,581
uh,
the workers in dubai where they entice 

2277
01:35:34,581 --> 01:35:35,490
them to come to dubai by saying you're 
going to get all this money,

2278
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:40,520
you know,
they take them from India and third 

2279
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,931
world countries and they basically say 
you are going to make x amount of 

2280
01:35:41,931 --> 01:35:44,931
dollars per month,
you'll be able to send money back home 

2281
01:35:44,931 --> 01:35:44,931
to your family.
Everybody's going to be happy.

2282
01:35:44,931 --> 01:35:44,931
We just,
uh,

2283
01:35:44,931 --> 01:35:45,600
you know,
just get,

2284
01:35:45,601 --> 01:35:48,600
come out here and you go get a passport 
and pay for this and pay for that.

2285
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:53,750
So they do all this.
They get out there and then once they 

2286
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:55,881
get out there,
they take their passport and they give 

2287
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:56,190
them a fraction of the money these girls
do is they recruit.

2288
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:57,060
These girls will say,
listen,

2289
01:35:57,061 --> 01:35:58,560
it's just gonna be you.
And the guy,

2290
01:35:58,561 --> 01:36:00,740
you'll get to pick the guy,
it'll be so hot,

2291
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:05,750
no big deal,
no one's going to see it pay you 1500 

2292
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:06,270
bucks.
And for a chick who's fucking broken,

2293
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:08,790
desperate and probably,
you know,

2294
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:11,040
not the best thinker in the world 
anyway,

2295
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:13,110
I'm not making the best decisions with 
their life,

2296
01:36:13,330 --> 01:36:18,330
you know.
And some guy offers are 1500 bucks to 

2297
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:18,330
fuck some cute guy.
She's like,

2298
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:18,330
whatever.
All right,

2299
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:18,990
I'll do it.
Fuck it.

2300
01:36:18,991 --> 01:36:20,130
Who cares?
Who's going to know?

2301
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:22,110
Who's going to know she figures.
I'm just going to go there.

2302
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:25,290
I'm going to take care of to keep them 
from repossessed my car.

2303
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:26,190
I'm going to,
you know,

2304
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:28,080
pay my rent off,
you know,

2305
01:36:28,081 --> 01:36:30,070
and I'll have a couple hundred bucks 
left over.

2306
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:30,930
Alright,
let's do it.

2307
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:36,170
So she gets there and there was a whole 
series about this on television that 

2308
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:37,290
they made her do double anal.
Once she got there,

2309
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:38,010
they said,
no,

2310
01:36:38,011 --> 01:36:41,730
we don't want regular sex like this is.
This is what happens to guys who have to

2311
01:36:41,731 --> 01:36:43,680
fuck your ass hole and we'll give you 
1500 bucks.

2312
01:36:43,681 --> 01:36:46,140
Otherwise we don't have work for you.
No condom,

2313
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,210
you know,
so she was getting hiv

2314
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:49,730
I.
Yeah.

2315
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:51,540
So she does one

2316
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:53,220
film.
She comes from like Nebraska.

2317
01:36:53,221 --> 01:36:58,221
She does one film.
They make her do double anal fucking 

2318
01:36:58,221 --> 01:37:00,660
pigs nut inside her asshole who probably
fucked 100 chicks that day,

2319
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:02,430
you know?
Yeah.

2320
01:37:02,431 --> 01:37:07,431
And they give her hiv.
They're probably shooting heroin up in 

2321
01:37:07,431 --> 01:37:09,561
the bathroom together.
So I'll get each other's cocks to get 

2322
01:37:09,561 --> 01:37:09,561
them hard and they stuffed it in her 
asshole.

2323
01:37:09,561 --> 01:37:10,740
By the way,
I wanted to mention something you talked

2324
01:37:10,741 --> 01:37:14,940
about last week in your secret podcast 
that I wanted to tell you that no,

2325
01:37:14,941 --> 01:37:17,010
brokeback mountain was a huge success.

2326
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:19,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

2327
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:20,530
I think as a comedy,
right?

2328
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:21,160
No,
no.

2329
01:37:21,161 --> 01:37:22,020
I mean moneywise.
Yeah,

2330
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:23,130
but as a comedy.
Oh yeah.

2331
01:37:23,131 --> 01:37:23,660
Yeah.
I'd say.

2332
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:27,070
I know people enjoyed it now.
There was a lot of people.

2333
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,230
It was sad.
I'll be honest.

2334
01:37:29,290 --> 01:37:31,690
At the end of brokeback mountain,
when the guy found out the other guy was

2335
01:37:31,691 --> 01:37:32,980
beaten to death,
it was sad.

2336
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:34,990
I never saw it.
I will never watch that.

2337
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:40,020
You want them while it's just watch it 
and video put like little kittens over 

2338
01:37:40,021 --> 01:37:40,130
there

2339
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:43,800
faces when they're kissing,
just like you always do.

2340
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:48,070
There's some shit that I won't watch,
but I won't watch anymore.

2341
01:37:48,150 --> 01:37:51,360
Beheadings there's a new line.
Have you seen the new one?

2342
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,050
I watched it for a second and they 
started cutting the dude's head off.

2343
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:55,740
I said,
all right.

2344
01:37:55,741 --> 01:37:56,130
What

2345
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:58,530
the fuck am I doing?
Why am I watching this?

2346
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:00,110
I'm done with that.
Yeah.

2347
01:38:00,370 --> 01:38:00,950
Yeah.
There's,

2348
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,770
there's no need to be watching that 
shit.

2349
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,320
I never even watched it.
Uh,

2350
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,630
Iraq shooting thing either.
Oh,

2351
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:11,631
that's the other thing.
I wanted to talk about this fake kung 

2352
01:38:11,631 --> 01:38:11,631
fu.
Yeah.

2353
01:38:11,631 --> 01:38:12,870
You need a rack shooting.
Now you need to bring that back.

2354
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:15,270
Then I need to write it out with what I 
need to do.

2355
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:17,850
I don't even remember how I did it.
I'll just redo it.

2356
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:19,400
But uh,
the um,

2357
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:20,820
uh,
the Iraq shooting thing,

2358
01:38:20,821 --> 01:38:21,620
he didn't want us.
The,

2359
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:26,720
I don't want to do.
We're just talking about collateral 

2360
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:26,720
murder,
which is.

2361
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:29,780
We talked about this before.
It was a date mistakenly thought that 

2362
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:32,130
these reporters and civilians in Iraq 
were insurgents and they killed them and

2363
01:38:32,131 --> 01:38:35,010
saw gun camera footage and it's very 
disturbing.

2364
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,470
It's disturbing how much they were into 
it.

2365
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:42,680
It's disturbing how easy it is to just 
think that anybody is your enemy when 

2366
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,250
you're over there and the fucking war 
and the chaos,

2367
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:44,800
you know,
it's,

2368
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:46,140
it's scary shit,
man.

2369
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,180
It's scary shit that were there in the 
first place,

2370
01:38:48,181 --> 01:38:53,181
but it's really scary shit to think that
people could just be walking with 

2371
01:38:53,181 --> 01:38:55,971
cameras and they mistake those cameras 
for guns just from the sky with apache 

2372
01:38:55,971 --> 01:39:00,441
helicopters.
Just fucking light them up with 50 

2373
01:39:00,441 --> 01:39:00,441
cannon.
I'm done.

2374
01:39:00,441 --> 01:39:00,441
The caliber gun.

2375
01:39:00,441 --> 01:39:02,960
I'm done with that shit and anything 
that's based off three men and a baby,

2376
01:39:02,961 --> 01:39:07,961
like three guys in a hammer in India.
This was based on the baby.

2377
01:39:09,111 --> 01:39:11,190
Two girls and a cup cup.
Yeah,

2378
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:13,160
no,
you're right man.

2379
01:39:13,161 --> 01:39:13,430
You know

2380
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:17,120
the problem is the internet really can 
not only desensitize you,

2381
01:39:17,121 --> 01:39:22,121
but really change your world.
There's 300 million fucking people in 

2382
01:39:22,121 --> 01:39:25,310
this country that is an insane amount of
people and if you think about like every

2383
01:39:25,311 --> 01:39:30,311
story that you hear about some priest 
who's fucking kids or some serial killer

2384
01:39:30,891 --> 01:39:34,760
who's killing women or they're all 
horrible and terrible,

2385
01:39:34,761 --> 01:39:38,240
but the reality is most people are 
pretty cool.

2386
01:39:38,690 --> 01:39:43,690
There's $300 million of us.
There's so much information that 

2387
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:47,261
literally you find out every single 
fucking story anytime that they think 

2388
01:39:47,261 --> 01:39:51,311
goes down.
That's never been the case in the 19 

2389
01:39:51,311 --> 01:39:51,311
fifties.
You had to be ed gain.

2390
01:39:51,311 --> 01:39:51,940
You gotta be,
you know,

2391
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:56,950
wearing women as fucking dresses.
You have to be cutting them up and put 

2392
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:57,000
in their skin on.
They had a fight.

2393
01:39:57,050 --> 01:40:00,200
You have to make the front fucking page 
of the New York times,

2394
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:03,500
like everyday for a week for everyone to
know who you are and everyone would know

2395
01:40:03,501 --> 01:40:04,030
your story.

2396
01:40:04,190 --> 01:40:05,930
The ted bundy case,
that's another example.

2397
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:08,690
The night stalker,
when he couldn't catch this guy and they

2398
01:40:08,691 --> 01:40:10,310
don't know what he's doing,
the zodiac killer,

2399
01:40:10,311 --> 01:40:12,260
they never caught them.
Those stories.

2400
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:17,350
That's the only way those stories became
who they had to be so catastrophic 

2401
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:18,890
really fucked up,
but now we hear about all of them.

2402
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:22,880
We hear about every two teachers this 
week got arrested for fucking kids.

2403
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,500
Two teachers,
two different teachers,

2404
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:28,550
both decent looking checks.
One of them was fucking a 16 year old.

2405
01:40:28,910 --> 01:40:31,910
She got arrested for a 16 year old.
How the fuck can you arrested?

2406
01:40:31,911 --> 01:40:33,230
Check for fucking a 16 year old.

2407
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:34,830
Did you mention it happened to me 
though?

2408
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:35,730
You know,
when I was a kid,

2409
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:39,900
a three of our teachers had sex.
One was a guy and two were girls.

2410
01:40:40,330 --> 01:40:45,330
When I was in high school,
my spanish teacher fucked one of my 

2411
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:45,330
friends.
Yeah,

2412
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:45,940
a female friend of mine.

2413
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:48,070
You know what the funniest thing is?
I remember my science teacher,

2414
01:40:48,071 --> 01:40:51,040
sixth grade,
I had my book underneath my desk.

2415
01:40:51,041 --> 01:40:53,050
I was reading the book while she was 
teaching and she,

2416
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:54,760
brian,
you have two heads.

2417
01:40:54,761 --> 01:40:56,440
Only one can read,
and I'm like,

2418
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:57,690
huh,
okay.

2419
01:40:57,691 --> 01:40:58,690
Well,
whatever that means,

2420
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:00,190
but then now I look back at it.
I'm like,

2421
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:05,220
oh my god.
She's talking about my head like I'm in 

2422
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:05,220
sixth grade.
What the fuck is that?

2423
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:07,330
Crazy.
Ms dot singleton,

2424
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:08,800
columbus,
Ohio.

2425
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:11,650
Fucking what are,
what are you were 12.

2426
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:15,850
How old were you then?
Twelfth grade 12,

2427
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:18,460
right?
Miss singleton and then mr philips,

2428
01:41:18,461 --> 01:41:20,860
you were my gym teacher.
You fucked half my friends.

2429
01:41:20,890 --> 01:41:21,730
Really?
Yeah.

2430
01:41:21,731 --> 01:41:26,680
And he got a resident gym teacher fucked
half your friends are girls mostly boys.

2431
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:29,370
And then,
and then moving,

2432
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:33,080
moving closer.
And then what was weird about it?

2433
01:41:33,081 --> 01:41:38,081
Wait,
I'm going to tell the whole goddamn 

2434
01:41:38,081 --> 01:41:38,081
story from springer in elementary.

2435
01:41:38,081 --> 01:41:38,540
Mr philips and he's in jail.
Uh,

2436
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:39,010
no,
no,

2437
01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:40,360
check this out.
He was.

2438
01:41:40,361 --> 01:41:42,670
Everyone was always talking about it in 
elementary school.

2439
01:41:42,671 --> 01:41:44,160
Like,
oh don't let Mr.

2440
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:44,470
Phillips,
you know,

2441
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:46,240
get near you.
He fucked so and so.

2442
01:41:46,241 --> 01:41:49,930
He fucked so and so before he even got 
caught this before.

2443
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:55,020
And there was times where like,
he would come up behind you next 

2444
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:55,020
spanking on the button like,
oh,

2445
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:57,250
you just touched on.
So he was fucking a bunch of kids before

2446
01:41:57,251 --> 01:41:59,890
he ever got me all knew about it and he 
never got caught.

2447
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:05,880
And then one day he got caught and then 
we and then there was this one kid that 

2448
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:07,150
we thought it was like the one at 
squealed or something like that,

2449
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:10,450
and then he was just gone.
He was gone and it was so weird.

2450
01:42:10,451 --> 01:42:11,650
It's like a,
I don't know,

2451
01:42:11,651 --> 01:42:16,651
like five years later I was working at 
toys r us and he came in with like a 

2452
01:42:16,651 --> 01:42:17,470
whole family and you're just wanting to 
say,

2453
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,300
hey,
you fucked my friends.

2454
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:20,650
What's up Mr.
Phillips.

2455
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:23,620
He came into toys r us with his family,
with his family,

2456
01:42:23,621 --> 01:42:26,380
kids and family.
And I just wanted it to be like,

2457
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:27,760
hey,
you know your husband.

2458
01:42:27,761 --> 01:42:30,040
How did he not go to jail?
I don't know what ever happened.

2459
01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:34,270
Like I barely remember seeing it in the 
papers and stuff like that.

2460
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:36,220
Gotta even if you went to jail,
he got out.

2461
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

2462
01:42:37,001 --> 01:42:37,870
And he.
So he fucked.

2463
01:42:37,871 --> 01:42:42,871
How many kids do you think?
I would say there was three that I 

2464
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:42,871
thought for sure.
Three that you thought for sure.

2465
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:44,500
I don't want to stay there.
And everybody talks about it.

2466
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,110
Oh yeah.
All of us knew about it.

2467
01:42:46,111 --> 01:42:51,111
It was like a joke growing up.
Even we would like other teachers knew 

2468
01:42:51,111 --> 01:42:51,490
like the word that we call him mr.
Film,

2469
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,080
fill me up.
Phillips know side,

2470
01:42:56,290 --> 01:42:57,880
brookside,
elementary school.

2471
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,580
Elementary school I remember was like 
fifth grade,

2472
01:43:00,581 --> 01:43:02,440
maybe sixth grade,
11,

2473
01:43:02,450 --> 01:43:02,800
10.

2474
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:07,060
So that your teacher was fucking 10 boys
in the app and then we had a study hall.

2475
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:11,740
My god,
we had a study hall monitor named Mrs.

2476
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:13,480
Hughes that used to just fuck everybody 
too.

2477
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:15,070
But she was hot.
She was and I was like,

2478
01:43:15,071 --> 01:43:17,080
oh,
I was mad because I wouldn't fuck.

2479
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:19,300
How old was the middle school was like 
eighth grade.

2480
01:43:19,301 --> 01:43:21,060
Seventh grade.
She was fucking eighth grade.

2481
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:21,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

2482
01:43:21,491 --> 01:43:26,491
And I remember I was pissed because I 
was jealous of the other guys who I 

2483
01:43:26,491 --> 01:43:29,851
fucked her and I'm like,
I want to fuck that girl saving up my 

2484
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:33,190
lunch money and stuff.
It's really funny how that works,

2485
01:43:33,191 --> 01:43:34,070
isn't it?
You know,

2486
01:43:34,071 --> 01:43:36,520
like,
like before the internet man,

2487
01:43:36,521 --> 01:43:39,400
shit like that would happen and nobody 
would hear about it.

2488
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:41,110
You know?
It had to be like they could,

2489
01:43:41,170 --> 01:43:46,170
they could fire the person and stopped 
the scandal before it ever hit the 

2490
01:43:46,170 --> 01:43:46,930
school and no big deal.
Nowadays,

2491
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:48,830
people just throw it up in their face 
face.

2492
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,680
Fuck you.
I got fucked in the ass.

2493
01:43:50,681 --> 01:43:51,690
But I,
Mr.

2494
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:53,060
Phillips,
he's a photo and video.

2495
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:53,690
Oh yeah.

2496
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:56,740
Video and photo.
While it's happening.

2497
01:43:56,750 --> 01:44:00,380
If someone's crazy enough to let you 
know for a teacher who's crazy enough to

2498
01:44:00,381 --> 01:44:05,381
fuck you,
she's crazy enough to film it while 

2499
01:44:05,381 --> 01:44:07,001
she's fucking crazy.
I'm 35 person asking,

2500
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:09,750
oh yeah,
that's a,

2501
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,440
that's a crazy goddamn story.
I didn't.

2502
01:44:12,441 --> 01:44:13,910
Um,
I never got molested by kid,

2503
01:44:13,911 --> 01:44:16,730
but I came close twice on two separate 
occasions.

2504
01:44:16,731 --> 01:44:19,310
I almost got molested one when I was 
eight years old.

2505
01:44:19,311 --> 01:44:22,250
I was at the library and I used to like 
a monster books.

2506
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:25,070
I used to like reading like dracula and 
frankenstein shit.

2507
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:28,430
And so I'm in this library section and 
I'm reading all these books.

2508
01:44:28,431 --> 01:44:33,431
I'm looking,
looking for these books and this guy 

2509
01:44:33,431 --> 01:44:33,431
says,
do you like books on monsters?

2510
01:44:33,431 --> 01:44:33,431
And I said,
yeah,

2511
01:44:33,431 --> 01:44:34,130
that's my favorite.
I'm like,

2512
01:44:34,131 --> 01:44:35,360
you're fucking eight years old,
right?

2513
01:44:35,361 --> 01:44:36,860
I don't know that there's bad people 
yet.

2514
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:39,050
I haven't really figured that out.
And the guy says,

2515
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:41,360
I've got a bunch of monster books out in
my car.

2516
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,410
Oh no.
And I said,

2517
01:44:42,411 --> 01:44:42,860
wow,
really?

2518
01:44:42,861 --> 01:44:43,250
He goes,
yeah,

2519
01:44:43,251 --> 01:44:45,170
come on with me.
I'll show you some monster books.

2520
01:44:45,171 --> 01:44:45,950
I go,
oh,

2521
01:44:45,951 --> 01:44:47,370
okay.
That's why he had monsters.

2522
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:50,120
I started leaving.
Still love monster movies,

2523
01:44:50,121 --> 01:44:55,121
man.
I start leaving and as I'm walking out 

2524
01:44:55,121 --> 01:44:56,540
the door with this guy,
the fucking librarians starts screaming.

2525
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:57,860
She goes,
joseph,

2526
01:44:57,950 --> 01:45:02,950
joseph,
you get older because she knew me 

2527
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:02,950
because I'd go to the library all the 
time.

2528
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:02,950
She's like,
joseph,

2529
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:02,950
get over here.
Get over here.

2530
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:07,930
That man just got out of jail,
and so the guy who runs the guy who 

2531
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:09,350
wants to go,
she goes,

2532
01:45:09,351 --> 01:45:12,170
I'm going to call the police,
and so I run over to the library and I'm

2533
01:45:12,171 --> 01:45:17,171
fucking crying and freaking out.
The crazy thing is my mom doesn't even 

2534
01:45:17,391 --> 01:45:18,130
remember this.

2535
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:21,260
Yeah.
My mom is kind of a knucklehead and when

2536
01:45:21,261 --> 01:45:22,730
it comes to that,
like my childhood,

2537
01:45:22,731 --> 01:45:24,470
like I can't believe she doesn't 
remember this.

2538
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:29,890
Remember that.
Not remember the most horrific moment of

2539
01:45:30,291 --> 01:45:31,240
my childhood.
Well,

2540
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:34,240
I feel like if that light.
Brian wasn't there at that moment,

2541
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:39,370
if I didn't have a relationship with her
where I talked to her every time I was 

2542
01:45:39,370 --> 01:45:39,590
there and she looked after me because 
she was a nice lady.

2543
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,150
If that didn't happen,
if there was,

2544
01:45:41,410 --> 01:45:44,540
she was some absent minded person or 
just wasn't looking or didn't know,

2545
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:46,520
didn't know who I was with.
That guy was.

2546
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:50,420
I woulda got fucked in the ass for sure.
I have got killed.

2547
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:53,030
He got killed because if this guy just 
got out of jail,

2548
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:56,150
he's probably tired of tattle tale on 
kids and their bullshit,

2549
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,020
you know,

2550
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:58,380
it probably would have fucked me.
Kill me.

2551
01:45:58,430 --> 01:46:00,960
You know that company that has that 
thing that you like.

2552
01:46:00,990 --> 01:46:03,150
Old people were like help.
I've fallen and I can't get up.

2553
01:46:03,151 --> 01:46:04,320
They should make that for kids like 
help.

2554
01:46:04,321 --> 01:46:06,160
I'm getting fucked and I can't draw.
They should.

2555
01:46:06,210 --> 01:46:07,940
But kids are fucking liars,
man.

2556
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:15,810
Be attached like boy scouts or something
like,

2557
01:46:15,811 --> 01:46:17,520
boy scouts will come rescue you instead.
Police.

2558
01:46:17,521 --> 01:46:19,460
There's those council.
Fuck you quicker than anybody.

2559
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:25,950
Nobody was,
you fucking knew like this because you 

2560
01:46:26,941 --> 01:46:28,180
lied about it.
Yeah.

2561
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:30,660
You let dictionary rant.
Come on.

2562
01:46:30,661 --> 01:46:32,280
Yeah,
maybe there will be like a little camera

2563
01:46:32,281 --> 01:46:33,630
and microphones so that be like,
oh,

2564
01:46:33,631 --> 01:46:35,700
you aren't getting fucked.
We'll send somebody right now.

2565
01:46:35,701 --> 01:46:36,030
I think

2566
01:46:36,030 --> 01:46:37,930
gps tracking is a good idea.
Yeah.

2567
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,620
You know,
I mean that's like the slippery slope.

2568
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:45,740
The problem is you put a chip in your 
kids so you could find out where they 

2569
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:48,081
are,
where they already called them with 

2570
01:46:48,081 --> 01:46:48,081
phones,
you know those.

2571
01:46:48,081 --> 01:46:48,081
Yeah.
They have those.

2572
01:46:48,081 --> 01:46:48,480
Yeah.
But phones is big.

2573
01:46:48,481 --> 01:46:51,450
Devastating.
And a chip in your skin mean like a dog,

2574
01:46:51,451 --> 01:46:53,440
like a dog has a chip,
you know,

2575
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:55,350
so I can if the,
if he gets going,

2576
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:58,710
I think it's only if he goes to the vet,
if they pick them up at the pound,

2577
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:01,830
the pound could scan them and the ship 
has like a number to call.

2578
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:04,530
But you know,
there's people that want to put like gps

2579
01:47:04,531 --> 01:47:06,420
chips in their kids so they could follow
their kids.

2580
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:11,700
That's retarded.
It don't matter if your kid's not 

2581
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:16,280
retarded,
but the slippery slope is who else has 

2582
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:16,280
fallen you,
the executive government.

2583
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:19,410
Anybody else?
Black helicopters you always hear about,

2584
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:24,411
um,
a dudes who like attached gps to their 

2585
01:47:24,411 --> 01:47:26,340
chicks car because they're stocking them
and they follow them.

2586
01:47:26,341 --> 01:47:27,600
They follow them around.
Yeah.

2587
01:47:27,601 --> 01:47:28,770
I mean,
you know,

2588
01:47:28,890 --> 01:47:33,890
it's a slippery slope because the,
the conductivity is unavoidable.

2589
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:37,320
It's unavoidable that eventually there 
will be no secrets.

2590
01:47:37,321 --> 01:47:39,270
I really believe that we've talked about
this before.

2591
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:42,900
I think that eventually we're going to 
be able to read each other's minds.

2592
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:46,560
We're going to be able to access all the
information in the whole world,

2593
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:48,930
not just on your phone,
not just a computer interface,

2594
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:54,110
but you're going to be able to normally 
access all this shit and that includes 

2595
01:47:54,110 --> 01:47:57,041
as other people's thoughts.
You're going to have to share your 

2596
01:47:57,041 --> 01:47:57,580
thoughts into the wave.
It sounds completely ridiculous.

2597
01:47:57,581 --> 01:48:02,581
Just sounds like total stoner talk,
but I don't think it sounds nearly as 

2598
01:48:02,581 --> 01:48:02,820
ridiculous as the things we already 
have,

2599
01:48:02,821 --> 01:48:07,821
like the large hadron collider or cell 
phones or the ability to talk to 

2600
01:48:07,821 --> 01:48:08,190
somebody on the other side of the world.

2601
01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:11,160
That's just as ridiculous to me.
I mean it's all ridiculous.

2602
01:48:11,161 --> 01:48:14,760
Sending pictures to the air high speed 
video you can download.

2603
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:16,260
You know what I mean?
I got wifi.

2604
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:19,050
I sit on my laptop.
I can download like the ipad.

2605
01:48:19,370 --> 01:48:22,470
You download a movie and a couple of 
minutes you could stream it.

2606
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:25,620
Stream a movie alive.
What the fuck?

2607
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:30,920
You can just go to netflix,
pick a movie and high definition loaded 

2608
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:30,960
up.
It plays.

2609
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:32,550
There it is.
There's the movie.

2610
01:48:32,551 --> 01:48:35,370
You're getting it from the ether.
You're getting a fucking full movie.

2611
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:40,460
You put your headphones on,
it's in stereo and you're getting it 

2612
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:43,521
from the sky.
That's insanity and that is just the 

2613
01:48:43,861 --> 01:48:44,910
beginning.
It's gonna happen.

2614
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:45,840
It's gonna.
The only.

2615
01:48:46,170 --> 01:48:50,490
If you look at the trend,
the number one trend is conductivity and

2616
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:55,580
the instant access to information or the
more quicker access to information or 

2617
01:48:55,580 --> 01:48:56,160
more access to information.

2618
01:48:56,190 --> 01:48:57,570
That's the trend.
It's like,

2619
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:00,170
you know,
used to be libraries and then you know,

2620
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:04,170
then then it was the internet and now 
it's the internet on your phone and then

2621
01:49:04,171 --> 01:49:05,850
what else is next?
What's gonna come next?

2622
01:49:05,851 --> 01:49:07,500
It's going to be quicker,
easier,

2623
01:49:07,501 --> 01:49:09,780
faster,
more information like that,

2624
01:49:09,781 --> 01:49:14,781
that search engine where you can just 
ask it questions and it comes up with 

2625
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:17,481
the answer.
What does that search engine called 

2626
01:49:17,481 --> 01:49:17,481
being?
No,

2627
01:49:17,481 --> 01:49:18,750
there's a new one that they're working 
on.

2628
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:20,310
I'll find it on here.
I got it.

2629
01:49:20,311 --> 01:49:24,210
I saved it on evernote,
but they called it the google killer.

2630
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:27,120
Now know what's going to be the best we 
already talking about.

2631
01:49:27,410 --> 01:49:32,410
But the visual search.
This I think what's going to be big 

2632
01:49:32,410 --> 01:49:35,500
visual search where you just take a 
picture of something and it will google 

2633
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:35,500
search what it is.
Everything about it,

2634
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:37,070
you know.
So like if you see like a,

2635
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:40,470
I don't know if you see like a tennis 
shoe on the ground,

2636
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:45,500
you can take a picture of it and we'll 
tell you what model of tennis shoe that 

2637
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:45,500
is,
you know,

2638
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:45,500
where it's sold,
how much it is,

2639
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:45,770
you know?

2640
01:49:45,910 --> 01:49:46,840
Yeah,
this is.

2641
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:47,950
Yeah.
Yeah,

2642
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,270
no,
I think you're right.

2643
01:49:49,271 --> 01:49:50,090
Yeah.
That,

2644
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:52,750
that,
that wolfram alpha is the new thing.

2645
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:57,780
W o l f r a m alpha and what it is,
is this thing that these guys have been 

2646
01:49:59,141 --> 01:50:01,720
putting together for a while.
It's not totally done yet,

2647
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:06,490
but the idea is that this is going to be
able to answer any question you have and

2648
01:50:06,491 --> 01:50:11,491
that you know,
I mean that really is the future that 

2649
01:50:11,491 --> 01:50:12,850
they'll take the data,
the entire database of science,

2650
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:15,910
the entire database of archeology,
history,

2651
01:50:15,911 --> 01:50:20,911
everything else.
Mathematics and literally put it into 

2652
01:50:20,911 --> 01:50:23,380
some sort of a search engine where 
you'll be able to ask the question.

2653
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:26,110
You know,
what year was the first car invented?

2654
01:50:26,350 --> 01:50:28,780
What year was the first combustion 
engine created?

2655
01:50:28,930 --> 01:50:33,930
You know,
when did they figure out that you could 

2656
01:50:33,930 --> 01:50:33,930
turn the oil from the ground and the 
gasoline?

2657
01:50:33,930 --> 01:50:36,730
How did they do it?
Who was the guy that shits gonna happen?

2658
01:50:36,731 --> 01:50:37,840
Man,
you're gonna.

2659
01:50:37,841 --> 01:50:39,280
You're gonna.
Be able to get any,

2660
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:43,450
any answer to any question.
You literally never have to go to school

2661
01:50:43,451 --> 01:50:43,690
again.

2662
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:48,800
I can't wait to the part where I can go 
through my old photos from when I was 

2663
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,120
like five years old.
Hold it up to my webcam.

2664
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:51,450
They go,
here's their facebook.

2665
01:50:51,451 --> 01:50:56,451
They now do this.
They look at this because there's so 

2666
01:50:56,451 --> 01:50:56,570
many people that have lost touch with 
and I don't know their name.

2667
01:50:56,610 --> 01:50:58,050
Babies.
What if it's a baby?

2668
01:50:58,110 --> 01:51:03,110
You can totally do it.
You're going to totally be able to do 

2669
01:51:03,110 --> 01:51:03,780
that to the 100 percent.
How the baby grows up hundred percent.

2670
01:51:03,810 --> 01:51:06,060
Ten years or less.
One hundred percent.

2671
01:51:06,290 --> 01:51:07,640
Yeah.
I think you're probably right.

2672
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:09,260
Wow.

2673
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:13,000
What's your fucking question?
Who this guy named carlos when see it as

2674
01:51:13,001 --> 01:51:16,870
a homo and needs to send his fans to 
space with the other monkeys.

2675
01:51:17,070 --> 01:51:19,600
All right buddy.
Settle the fuck down.

2676
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:21,700
Settle down.
You freak.

2677
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:24,940
What is this guy saying?
You hate men.

2678
01:51:24,941 --> 01:51:26,720
Sia for stealing jokes,
but you still don't.

2679
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:28,150
T rex joke.
Hypocrite.

2680
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:31,090
I didn't sell steel shit.
See rex job.

2681
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:36,410
Someone said that there was another guy 
who was a joke about trx not being able 

2682
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:36,410
to jerk off this.

2683
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:41,030
Wow.
How obvious is this that he can check 

2684
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:41,030
off?

2685
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:42,140
Not the greatest connection in the 
world,

2686
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:44,840
but when you have small arms and you 
can't grab your own dick,

2687
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:48,020
I know anybody can come up with that 
conclusion,

2688
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:53,330
but what I had it in is a whole series 
of things about masturbation.

2689
01:51:53,331 --> 01:51:58,331
Now masturbation is evolutionary and my 
joke was that's why the t rex didn't 

2690
01:51:58,331 --> 01:51:59,840
evolve because couldn't jerk off 100 
percent my own.

2691
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:04,990
Okay.
And there's a thing called parallel 

2692
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:05,590
thinking.
The difference between me and a guy like

2693
01:52:05,790 --> 01:52:10,790
me or most comics I've got ligaments.
Ia is most comics like dave attell is 

2694
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:12,530
famous for.
He comes up with a joke,

2695
01:52:12,531 --> 01:52:14,330
he'll call like a bunch of people and 
say,

2696
01:52:14,331 --> 01:52:15,590
hey,
if you ever heard this before,

2697
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:20,620
you've heard this before,
because sometimes guys come up with 

2698
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:20,620
jokes and even though you came up with 
it on your own,

2699
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:22,850
you don't know whether or not anybody 
else has come up with it before.

2700
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:25,190
It's very possible.
It's called parallel thinking,

2701
01:52:25,700 --> 01:52:30,700
but the difference between that and a 
guy like matt cea or robin williams or 

2702
01:52:30,741 --> 01:52:35,741
any of these other guys that have been 
accused of doing it over and over again 

2703
01:52:35,741 --> 01:52:35,741
is there so many fucking pieces of 
evidence.

2704
01:52:35,741 --> 01:52:40,540
So many times people have said it.
So many people know bits that they've 

2705
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:42,860
ripped off and like with a guy like 
robin williams,

2706
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,170
they used to have it set up where there 
was special.

2707
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:50,560
When he would come to the room,
people would flash lights to make sure 

2708
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:50,560
that the comics onstage knew that he was
in the room.

2709
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:53,870
When I was in boston,
I'm at catch a rising star and cambridge

2710
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:57,350
robin williams came and I remember this 
because I was really raw.

2711
01:52:57,351 --> 01:53:00,620
I was like an open mic or I'd only been 
doing comedy like not even a year.

2712
01:53:01,230 --> 01:53:06,230
You got to piss and robin williams came 
into the club and there was all these 

2713
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:07,400
comics that were like a big name.

2714
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:09,800
Boston comics.
I think one of them was,

2715
01:53:09,801 --> 01:53:11,260
um,
you know what?

2716
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:12,470
I don't want to say names because I'm 
just,

2717
01:53:12,471 --> 01:53:17,471
I'm just guessing.
But there was a bunch of a boston 

2718
01:53:17,471 --> 01:53:17,510
headliners in the room and none of them 
would go on stage.

2719
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:22,540
They wouldn't go on stage because they 
knew that he was in there and that if 

2720
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:24,110
they did a good bit on that stage and 
they were local guys,

2721
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:26,270
there were local headliners,
but they were just local guys.

2722
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:28,280
And this was before the internet.
This is before anything.

2723
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:30,710
He would just go on the tonight show,
the next night,

2724
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:32,600
do their bit.
And that bit was dead.

2725
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:37,630
They could never do it again.
So it was a totally different era back 

2726
01:53:37,630 --> 01:53:37,630
then.
But there's parallel thinking.

2727
01:53:37,630 --> 01:53:38,980
There's things that,
uh,

2728
01:53:39,110 --> 01:53:44,110
I've thought of before.
There's things that other people have 

2729
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:44,110
thought of before that I've already 
done.

2730
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:44,700
Like I've had friends,
you know,

2731
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,820
do a bit and uh,
you know,

2732
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:48,710
there,
I know they didn't steal it from me,

2733
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:50,000
but I have to tell them like,
hey,

2734
01:53:50,001 --> 01:53:52,070
that's on my first album.
Like this.

2735
01:53:52,071 --> 01:53:54,680
The same exact sort of connection that 
you just made.

2736
01:53:55,190 --> 01:53:57,620
Bobby slayton and I who bobby's a buddy 
of mine,

2737
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:59,810
but we both had a joke.
I mean,

2738
01:53:59,811 --> 01:54:02,750
it's the same connection about blow 
jobs.

2739
01:54:02,751 --> 01:54:05,570
It was,
mine was on my 1999 cd.

2740
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,090
I don't know when his was,
but uh,

2741
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:09,950
he said to me like,
wow,

2742
01:54:09,951 --> 01:54:14,951
we have like a similar joke.
And the joke was about blowjobs that 

2743
01:54:14,951 --> 01:54:17,570
blow jobs or a job.
That's why implies like jerking off.

2744
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:19,190
See,
my joke was a drifting off.

2745
01:54:19,191 --> 01:54:20,930
Sounds like it's no big deal.
That's like,

2746
01:54:20,931 --> 01:54:22,000
you just,
you know,

2747
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:23,120
was just quit at any minute.
Like,

2748
01:54:23,121 --> 01:54:28,121
what are you doing?
I was just dripping off like no big 

2749
01:54:28,121 --> 01:54:28,121
deal.

2750
01:54:28,121 --> 01:54:28,121
You want to eat?
I'll just stop.

2751
01:54:28,121 --> 01:54:29,630
But a blow job sounds like there's much 
more commitment.

2752
01:54:29,631 --> 01:54:32,300
Like it's a job,
like they're implies a work ethic,

2753
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:36,390
but that like jerking off is way more 
commitment involved the jerking off then

2754
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:39,710
blowjobs because chicks will quit blow 
jobs all the time.

2755
01:54:39,711 --> 01:54:41,450
Girls will quit,
their mouth gets tired.

2756
01:54:41,451 --> 01:54:44,510
They don't want to do it anymore,
but no dude quits while jerking off.

2757
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:46,010
And there's like,
you know what I mean?

2758
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,050
It's true.
Like just fucking finish that thing.

2759
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:52,370
I have had like a half hard dick and be 
like holding my breath and squeezing.

2760
01:54:52,371 --> 01:54:57,371
My boss tried to do anything to to 
figure out a way to just get it over 

2761
01:54:57,371 --> 01:54:59,030
with and then once you calm you just 
feel so god damn pathetic.

2762
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:03,170
But there's a lot of commitment involved
in jerking off for whatever reason.

2763
01:55:03,171 --> 01:55:04,970
Like that's shit wants to get out of 
your body,

2764
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:10,240
but I never for a second thought that 
bobby stole a bit and he didn't think 

2765
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:11,300
that I saw the bit.
It's like it's kind of obvious blow job,

2766
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:16,330
you know?
It's not the most clever connection 

2767
01:55:16,330 --> 01:55:16,330
between it being a job.
You know what I mean?

2768
01:55:16,330 --> 01:55:17,150
It's right there.
It's in the fucking name.

2769
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:20,910
The problem with [inaudible],
like when like that t rex thing,

2770
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:25,940
that's just something that's a cartoon 
online that I saw after the fact that 

2771
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:30,110
the story they haD jokes about,
you know that I mean that's just the 

2772
01:55:30,110 --> 01:55:30,890
dumbest.
It's just obvious.

2773
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,250
Troll and I think might know

2774
01:55:34,090 --> 01:55:37,210
probably just stupid or was just young 
and he doesn't know.

2775
01:55:37,211 --> 01:55:37,850
I mean,
it's,

2776
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:38,620
look,
you know,

2777
01:55:38,621 --> 01:55:43,621
people,
people have questions about the way 

2778
01:55:43,621 --> 01:55:44,910
Comedy works and whenever someone is so 
about plagiarism,

2779
01:55:44,911 --> 01:55:49,911
like I have been in,
you have been with that whole men see a 

2780
01:55:49,911 --> 01:55:49,911
thing,
uh,

2781
01:55:49,911 --> 01:55:50,430
you know,
not like we set out to do that.

2782
01:55:50,431 --> 01:55:55,431
Not like we set out to be the guys that 
are speaking up against comedy 

2783
01:55:55,431 --> 01:55:58,461
plagiarism.
But let me tell you how many fucking 

2784
01:55:58,461 --> 01:55:58,461
comedians were happy that,
that happened.

2785
01:55:58,461 --> 01:55:58,461
I mean,
I can't tell.

2786
01:55:58,461 --> 01:56:00,780
I've just got a text message from 
christopher titus today.

2787
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:06,230
Christopher titus was a friend of mine,
just sent me a text today and 

2788
01:56:06,230 --> 01:56:07,660
christopher is a very funny comic.
And uh,

2789
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:12,020
he sent me a text today saying that,
um,

2790
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:13,980
he says,
hey man,

2791
01:56:13,981 --> 01:56:18,981
you were on npr today.
They played the whole carlos thing and 

2792
01:56:18,981 --> 01:56:21,420
had two lawyers on talking about how 
convenience protect our material.

2793
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:24,180
Great job changing the world,
keep the flow.

2794
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:26,360
And you get a copy of that.
Yeah.

2795
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:28,030
This is a comic.
So,

2796
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:29,640
and it's not just him.
I mean louis,

2797
01:56:29,641 --> 01:56:30,050
c,
k,

2798
01:56:30,051 --> 01:56:31,680
so the same thing,
you know,

2799
01:56:31,681 --> 01:56:36,681
uh,
brian posehn came up and hugged me and 

2800
01:56:36,681 --> 01:56:36,681
said,
thank god for you joe rogan.

2801
01:56:36,681 --> 01:56:40,401
I mean I came,
todd glass came out to me and said it 

2802
01:56:40,401 --> 01:56:40,401
was the greatest thing you've ever seen 
in his life.

2803
01:56:40,401 --> 01:56:42,000
Like I can't tell you how many comics 
have said this,

2804
01:56:42,001 --> 01:56:47,001
like we had a real problem for a long 
time and the real problem is that these 

2805
01:56:47,001 --> 01:56:50,730
networks can make money from god's 
stealing if guys are good performers and

2806
01:56:50,731 --> 01:56:53,010
they wound up stealing people's shit.
They can make a lot of money.

2807
01:56:53,011 --> 01:56:57,750
And for comIcs literally it takes a long
ass time to create a bit like,

2808
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:02,780
a bit like my bit about the tigers 
killing the kid at the zoo in san 

2809
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:02,780
francisco.

2810
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:04,290
The one that made it onto my last 
special.

2811
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:08,820
THat bit took a long time to get right.
There was a lot of shit involved in like

2812
01:57:08,910 --> 01:57:10,950
it went back and forth.
It changed,

2813
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:12,210
morphed,
it got bigger,

2814
01:57:12,211 --> 01:57:17,211
it got smaller.
It took a long time before I came up 

2815
01:57:17,211 --> 01:57:17,250
with the version that got onto 
television.

2816
01:57:17,550 --> 01:57:20,280
It was a lot of work.
Somebody could have easily come in,

2817
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:21,780
jacked.
My idea,

2818
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:23,580
jack,
my premise jack,

2819
01:57:23,581 --> 01:57:28,581
the whole way I structured it,
set it up and just taking it for their 

2820
01:57:28,581 --> 01:57:31,671
own and literally it's stealing.
They put it on television and now I 

2821
01:57:31,671 --> 01:57:32,190
can't do it anymore because now if I do 
it,

2822
01:57:32,191 --> 01:57:34,290
you know,
like when a minute cstl stuff,

2823
01:57:34,291 --> 01:57:36,960
he steals it like word for word,
you know,

2824
01:57:36,961 --> 01:57:39,150
oftentimes.
So like these poor folks,

2825
01:57:39,151 --> 01:57:43,260
like there are bits gone.
It's like it's got stole,

2826
01:57:43,290 --> 01:57:45,690
they got stolen,
somebody took their shit.

2827
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:48,720
That's been a gigantic problem for us.
You know,

2828
01:57:48,721 --> 01:57:53,721
we didn't set out to be the ones to try 
to put a fork in that and stop it,

2829
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:59,150
but something had to happen and it did.
And it just so happens that it was us 

2830
01:57:59,150 --> 01:58:00,960
and it's just,
just synchronicity.

2831
01:58:00,961 --> 01:58:02,580
Just the way the world works,
you know.

2832
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:08,150
But um,
I can understand why someone would want 

2833
01:58:08,150 --> 01:58:08,430
to like,
scrutinize me extra carefully because of

2834
01:58:08,431 --> 01:58:08,710
that.
I mean,

2835
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:12,180
that only makes sense.
Put red bands balls to your mouth,

2836
01:58:12,181 --> 01:58:13,290
please.
You know what,

2837
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:16,440
that is a fucking rude,
rude request.

2838
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:22,200
Uh,
there's this kind of comic named Brian 

2839
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:22,200
Jarvis,
I don't know if you ever heard him.

2840
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:25,260
He has the best joke ever for some 
reason.

2841
01:58:25,261 --> 01:58:27,240
Comics all like to show their dicks to 
each other,

2842
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:32,420
but he has this thing where he'll put 
his dick coming out of the top of his 

2843
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:34,350
pants like right here.
So just its head sticking out.

2844
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:35,730
And he'd be like,
dude,

2845
01:58:35,731 --> 01:58:38,150
I fucking slammed my belly button in my 
door.

2846
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:40,950
Look at it and your belly button and you
look and you're like,

2847
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:41,650
whoa,

2848
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,590
wait,
do all the time.

2849
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:48,640
I love that shit.
I mean I hate that shit,

2850
01:58:48,641 --> 01:58:53,050
but I love how everyone's so comics are 
so committed to showing their dicks.

2851
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:54,040
It's hilarious.

2852
01:58:55,890 --> 01:58:58,130
George lopez deal a bit from our.
no,

2853
01:58:58,140 --> 01:59:03,140
I don't think he did.
I think that thing that happened with 

2854
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:03,330
the George Lopez thing was that it was a
pretty obvious bit.

2855
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:05,880
The thing with the rap thing about the 
wall.

2856
01:59:05,970 --> 01:59:08,250
That's it.
That's a Fucking obvious job man.

2857
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:11,910
And these dudes who do like mexican 
material,

2858
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:15,540
you know,
an illegal alien material like lopez,

2859
01:59:15,660 --> 01:59:17,340
his actors.
It's very funny,

2860
01:59:17,341 --> 01:59:20,050
but a lot of is latino stuff.
And that's thE kind of thing,

2861
01:59:20,051 --> 01:59:21,270
I mean,
he's got to think like that.

2862
01:59:21,630 --> 01:59:24,060
George has never been accused of being a
deep before that.

2863
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:25,870
Not that I'm aware of,
but

2864
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:31,000
he's not an obvIous joke.
there was like five comics that dead 

2865
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,461
that joe put them and see a thing meant 
not only did ari open for him and do 

2866
01:59:34,461 --> 01:59:37,950
that bit and he saw it and commented on 
how he thought it was funny.

2867
01:59:38,190 --> 01:59:42,430
But that dumb fuck did the same 
mannerisms that are like windows.

2868
01:59:43,410 --> 01:59:45,120
Excuse me.
That's how he does it.

2869
01:59:45,121 --> 01:59:50,121
And he's so dumb.
He does it the exact same way in our 

2870
01:59:50,121 --> 01:59:51,030
video.
He even said he never opened up for me.

2871
01:59:51,031 --> 01:59:52,840
And then like three seconds later,
he what?

2872
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:53,640
oh,
he forgot he was.

2873
01:59:53,730 --> 01:59:55,420
I mean,
he just likes to read that whole video.

2874
01:59:55,890 --> 01:59:58,260
He's got everything.
he's still sometimes says he's mexican.

2875
01:59:58,290 --> 02:00:01,560
Are we talking about ms?
See if there's no poor guy.

2876
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:04,370
Poor guy.
Some people people

2877
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:07,440
still get.
I still get caught up in it.

2878
02:00:07,470 --> 02:00:08,040
You know,
look,

2879
02:00:08,041 --> 02:00:09,480
there's,
there is,

2880
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:12,750
there's always gonna be retards.
There's always gonna be dumb fucks.

2881
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:13,970
Oh,
he's going to be choked faced.

2882
02:00:14,010 --> 02:00:15,540
There's always goIng to be everything,
man.

2883
02:00:15,541 --> 02:00:16,560
There's,
there's always,

2884
02:00:16,590 --> 02:00:18,810
there's always gonna be people who enjoy
stupid shit.

2885
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:20,360
There's always going to be people who,
uh,

2886
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:23,190
think nancy is hilarious and I suck.
That's all good,

2887
02:00:23,191 --> 02:00:25,770
man.
It's a fucking big world,

2888
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:27,210
you know,
like what you like.

2889
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:29,760
Who gives a fuck son?
Well,

2890
02:00:29,761 --> 02:00:32,400
you know what,
we're at five minutes and 13 seconds,

2891
02:00:32,401 --> 02:00:35,550
which means we just ate through two 
hours.

2892
02:00:35,551 --> 02:00:38,550
So that's more than enough.
More than enough.

2893
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:40,770
I'll look.
There's all this comedy stuff,

2894
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:41,670
you know,
go,

2895
02:00:41,700 --> 02:00:42,350
go.
Let's you hear.

2896
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:45,360
So instead of all this negative stuff,
crossman sia rules,

2897
02:00:45,361 --> 02:00:47,670
that's what he rules your mother.
This is,

2898
02:00:47,671 --> 02:00:48,960
um,
this is,

2899
02:00:48,961 --> 02:00:50,820
uh,
what I think there's,

2900
02:00:50,850 --> 02:00:52,500
there's great comics right now.

2901
02:00:52,590 --> 02:00:55,080
This is one of the best times ever for 
standup comedy.

2902
02:00:55,230 --> 02:01:00,230
There's so many good guys.
There's bIll burr who is a hilarious 

2903
02:01:00,230 --> 02:01:00,600
comic.
If you never heard his stuff before.

2904
02:01:00,601 --> 02:01:05,601
I did that.
I'm kevin and being april foolishness 

2905
02:01:05,601 --> 02:01:07,860
show with him a couple of weekends ago.
Fucking dude is fantastic.

2906
02:01:07,861 --> 02:01:10,260
He's hilarious.
There's patton oswald,

2907
02:01:10,261 --> 02:01:13,050
who's one of my favorites.
He's goddamn hilarious.

2908
02:01:13,051 --> 02:01:15,570
All of his cds are great.
It's just an awesome writer,

2909
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:17,730
stan hope.
Of course,

2910
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:20,730
you know,
he's a classIc and nor did jim norton.

2911
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:22,920
Hilarious louis ck.
Of course.

2912
02:01:22,921 --> 02:01:26,460
There's so many good comics now.
Now instead of thinking positive,

2913
02:01:26,490 --> 02:01:30,120
instead of thinking negative about guys 
steal and bullshit and the problems with

2914
02:01:30,121 --> 02:01:35,121
this and that,
the positive thing is there's so much 

2915
02:01:35,121 --> 02:01:37,521
good comedy now.
There's so many good comedians and if 

2916
02:01:37,521 --> 02:01:38,550
you like my shit,
my neW thing just came out.

2917
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:40,340
You could get.
It's talking monkeys In space.

2918
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:43,040
It's on itunes.
You can get it on dvd.

2919
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:48,070
Joe rogan.net.

2920
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:48,860

on itunes.

2921
02:01:48,861 --> 02:01:51,680
Comedy bitch.
Get my ass kicked by robin williams,

2922
02:01:51,681 --> 02:01:53,750
but that wasn't the point.
Is this good stuff?

2923
02:01:53,751 --> 02:01:55,160
Now?
That's what's important.

2924
02:01:55,190 --> 02:01:56,720
Positive,
not negative.

2925
02:01:56,780 --> 02:01:58,940
You fucking faggots.
All right.

2926
02:01:59,030 --> 02:02:01,400
Thank you very much for tuning in.
We had a good time.

2928
