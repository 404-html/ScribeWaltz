1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,110
Boom. What was the original
pronunciation? Well,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,600
standing is back in the old days,
it was Sam the butcher and Joe the barber,

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,490
and, and my great grandfather was a
husband, which is a singer of holy songs,

4
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:17,100
like cantor would be the term now.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,920
And when my grandfather
came to Ellis island,

6
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:23,400
he didn't speak English and
they wrote it up as h a s s a n.

7
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:28,080
And so I've lived my life
being thought of as an Arab,

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,840
being persecuted at times by Jews.

9
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,690
I'm actually Jewish and I
belonged to the persecuted you.

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,200
I've had experiences
where people made yes,

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,130
your name because of the spelling of
my name. Let them, hey, you asshole,

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,260
I'm one of you. Well first they'd
say, you know, being a bigot.

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,010
And then I'd say, by the way, I'm Jewish.
And what did they say? I'm so sorry.

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,340
They would look at me and then they'd say,
you don't look Sephardic.

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,450
I'm on Ashkenazi. But uh,
anyway, it's, you know,

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,010
like act with some dignity and
compassion and kindness. Yeah.

17
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:06,060
Especially for no reason. It's not like
you did something antisemetic right.

18
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,910
The first time I was actually physically
assaulted was during the six day war

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
back in the 60s when I was in elementary
school and on a stairwell in Queens,

20
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,370
New York. You were assaulted
because of your ethnicity?

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,800
I was assaulted by Jews who thought I
was an Arab. Jesus Christ. And they,

22
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:28,470
they attacked me and I threw them down.
I grew up,

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,630
I grew up in my father's
hardware business,

24
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:34,020
so I kind of like knew how to pick up
a hundred pound bags of rock salt and

25
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:38,160
stuff. So they like fell on
the floor. And then I said,

26
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:41,580
you schmuck some Jewish.
I like how you schmuck that way.

27
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,770
No, he's in Judaism. Sort of a cult.

28
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,830
So let me just explain what
Steve Does. Anyway. Steve
Hassan. Hassan. Hassan. Hassan.

29
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,230
Hassan. Yes. Yes. Um, you,
you, you wrote a book, um,

30
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,180
combating cult mind control.

31
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,410
I got ahold of you because of my friend
Nate quarry who used to fight for the

32
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:06,700
UFC and a, he is one who, uh, uh,

33
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,530
connected me to you.
And uh,

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,540
he was a Jehovah's Witness for Awhile
and, uh, grew up in it. Yes. Yes,

35
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,080
he did.

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,080
And he wrote me a really interesting
email about the mind control process of

37
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:21,950
that.
That particular call,

38
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,320
your book combating cult
mind control, um, is, um,

39
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,460
right here it says number one
bestselling guide to protection,

40
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:35,340
rescue and recovery from
destructive cults is Judaism McCall.

41
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,300
So first let me just say that book first
came out in 1988 and it had a fellow on

42
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,060
the front cover who looked
a little bit like you but,

43
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:50,070
but clean shaven and he had a pad
lock and a chain around his forehead.

44
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:53,880
I hated it. I told the publisher I
hated it. They created the artwork,

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,780
did the artwork. And anyway,
it's been out for 25,

46
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,490
27 years now in hardback.
And

47
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,290
I've finally bought the rights back and
I've updated it post-internet including

48
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:10,120
terrorists and human trafficking and
including people born into cults like the

49
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:13,780
Jehovah's Witnesses. So that said, um,

50
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,910
I grew up in a conservative Jewish family,
the youngest of three.

51
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:21,710
My mom was an art teacher.
My Dad had a hardware store.

52
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:25,240
It as a musician before
that and after that, um,

53
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,230
and I really didn't like the
Judaism that I was taught,

54
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,500
but I was very close to my mom
and my maternal grandfather.

55
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:36,730
He was Orthodox and I grew up with
a spiritual feeling and connection.

56
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:41,731
I may still feel that connection and I'm
actually part of an alternative Jewish

57
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:44,820
community for the last 17 years.
But the,

58
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:49,821
the point that I want to say is that
there's a whole range and I actually gave

59
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:52,870
you a blow up of a graphic,
I don't know if you're going to use it,

60
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:57,400
but have ethical influence
and unethical influence.

61
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,430
And the idea is that one can look at
specific behavioral components and

62
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:07,771
determine whether or not it's a
destructive cult or a benign cult or

63
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,430
constructive cult.

64
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,330
So the word called in and of
itself tends to be pejorative,

65
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,360
but as someone who is quoted in the book
called the cult of Mac as a disciple,

66
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,630
uh, myself and the book, uh,

67
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,710
Max, yeah. Max Being Apple.

68
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,400
Yeah.

69
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,950
That was literally interviewed by this
writer who actually has a website called

70
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:32,890
the called the Mac. And he said,
your editor, my editor said,

71
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:37,090
I have to interview you. And I said, what
about writing a book about computers?

72
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:41,910
I said, that's weird. That's
not the typical interview. I go,

73
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,460
what's the title? He said, the
cult of Mac, and I laughed. I said,

74
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:49,060
I've been using apple since 1982
and a half, five Max right now,

75
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:52,060
but if you still want me to do an
interview, I'll be happy to do it.

76
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,110
I do believe that people, there are
certain people that are in a cult of Mac,

77
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,170
100% and I noticed it in the
90s when I was on Newsradio,

78
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,690
all the people on the staff, all the
people that work behind the scenes,

79
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,770
they would get so excited when a
new ios operating system came out,

80
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,210
apple s and they would talk about
it like we've got a new one now.

81
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:12,190
It's going to be better than windows.
It's going to be amazing. Yeah.

82
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,530
Science is a social science to
creating a called, but again,

83
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,280
I, I cite the bite model
and site that you know,

84
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,760
if there's deception,
so there's lack of informed consent.

85
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:26,890
If does extreme use of fear and guilt.

86
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:30,820
If there's information control where
people are being told you can't talk to

87
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:35,770
critics or or defectors or you need to
cut off from family or friends who are

88
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:39,520
questioning you. That's I'm, I'm
concerned about human rights.

89
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:44,521
I think the easiest way to understand
what I do as a former cult member myself,

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,700
it's really in support of the United
Nations Universal Declaration of human

91
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:49,534
rights,

92
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,150
not necessarily anti cult.

93
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,210
You are anti negative cults that have a
detrimental effect on a person's life.

94
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,461
Yeah,

95
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:02,630
and I would actually blow the frame up a
little bit bigger since I've been doing

96
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:07,610
this work for 39 years and I would say
I'm against undue influence. Undue.

97
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,590
How do you,

98
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,840
it's a legal term for exploitative
influence as compared to ethical influence

99
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:19,940
where it like a therapist is trying to
help somebody to confront their fears or

100
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:24,500
as a influence of helping somebody who
is addicted to something that's that's

101
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:28,460
killing them. When you put a lot
of religions in that category,

102
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:31,910
then that classification
of undue influence, right,

103
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:34,720
so the B you asked me is Judaism and halt.

104
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,120
The answer is there are
Jewish cults for sure.

105
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:43,130
And there are lots of other Jewish
temples and affiliations that are not

106
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,100
destructive cults.
So what would you consider them?

107
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,880
Them meaning the positive ones? I belong
to Temple Beth scion in Brookline,

108
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:57,490
Massachusetts. Brookline agree. My,

109
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,240
my rabbi wrote the Big Book of Jewish
humor and he was a comedian for most of

110
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:05,770
his adult career. He became
a rabbi later on, uh,

111
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,990
emotional wall docs and he cracks jokes
even during Yom Kippor and he's my kind

112
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:14,210
of rabbi.
It's not it,

113
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,380
it's gay friendly women's Center,
social justice.

114
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,360
But we love to sing. We left the chant.
We love to dive in. We love to do oven.

115
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,590
Davening is, is religious
prayer. Oh, okay.

116
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,580
Going through the side door and learning
toe or I love to go to tourist study.

117
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:37,580
It, it resonates for me, uh,
in terms of my spiritual path.

118
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:38,231
That said,

119
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:43,231
I've also studied Buddhism and I have
a teacher who was teaching me a Korean

120
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:47,990
form of meditation and movement.
He's a martial artists by the way.

121
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,610
Oh yeah. Korean martial arts
would kind, he's a swordsman.

122
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,890
Swordsman so it does like Kendo
or something, something like that.

123
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,700
The version of like the real sword thing.

124
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,470
Endo is a real art of sword and
they just use bamboo sticks.

125
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:06,630
We kind of know his Japanese
legs. Yes. Yeah. Um,

126
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,860
I learned a little bit of that in the
movies they would teach you in the moonies

127
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,240
Kendo really shiny.
It's nice to teach a little zone.

128
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,480
It's probably just in case they have to
take over the world and everybody's out

129
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:21,200
of, boy, I hope we have a chance to chat
about the moonies at some point we will

130
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:25,850
definitely call chat about
the moonies. So you, so you,

131
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,390
would you say your,
uh,

132
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,450
by doing this being involved in an
organized religion and ancient organized

133
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:35,630
religion in a sec that
you feel as positive,

134
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,080
would it be just more of a community
of philosophy and maybe just a,

135
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:46,230
a just a, a nice group
of people that, well,

136
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,700
it is a nice group of people.
Fans. We are independent,

137
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:54,650
although were influenced by the renewal
movement of Zalman Checked Shola me,

138
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,690
but we're trying to, what does that
mean? Where that's the name of a,

139
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:02,330
of a spiritual leader, a rabbi who
passed away who basically said, yeah,

140
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,190
and he liked to smoke pot. By
the way. I like him already.

141
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,410
He talked about like updating the
traditions for the modern time and that we

142
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:12,960
need,

143
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,960
the whole point is growth and
connection to other beings in a loving,

144
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:21,480
compassionate way.
It's not about being exclusive.

145
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:24,840
It's not about putting other
people down to be on your path.

146
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,000
It's about awareness and consciousness.
Well,

147
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,890
that sounds like a very
healthy perspective.

148
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,450
I don't think I would be part of a
spiritual community after everything I've

149
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:41,451
been through that wasn't super healthy
and giving me more than I was taking from

150
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,450
me. Are you allowed to eat bacon
in that group? People eat bacon.

151
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,780
I personally don't eat bacon. My
wife Loves Bacon, but uh, we're,

152
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:53,850
we're not. We drive to temple.
I live several miles away.

153
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:57,960
My rabbi drives to temp even
on Saturday on Shabbat. Whoa.

154
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,610
But you know, it's more important
to show up at temple then too,

155
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,140
you know, then to Miss
Temple, some mystical.

156
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,980
So the,
all of the carbs,

157
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:14,981
the rules should serve the spiritual
purpose and not the other way around that

158
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,750
these people are just compressed
into this rigidity, right,

159
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:23,810
of conformity and obedience and guilt
and shame that we are not into guilt and

160
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:28,830
shame. We're into joy and love and
laughter and helping one another.

161
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,570
That sounds very ideal. As far as
Cultco I, I think so. So it's a call.

162
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:36,210
It was just a really good
one. It's a good, um,

163
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,580
some people in Boston call it a cult
and I'm like, I'm a happily say,

164
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:44,970
I've been there for 17 years, from
the very beginning of his, uh,

165
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,460
his invitation to become a rabbi there.

166
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,010
And we've had our ups and downs, but
it's, it's healthy, it's accountable.

167
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,930
Uh, the membership make the agenda.
It's not tap top down, you know,

168
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,550
a dictatorship type thing.

169
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,570
It's the membership and a downs.

170
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,870
What's the downs?
Um,

171
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,560
there was some personality power conflicts
with teen and an assistant rabbi and

172
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:17,110
Moshe that was, um, other, you know,

173
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,730
just always how it works. So he's
some power struggle, you know,

174
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:25,590
human beings are imperfect.
And the key is,

175
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,690
is you know,

176
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,790
if somebody calls you on your shit that
you step back and you listen and you

177
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:35,160
reflect and you the correct your,

178
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,670
your your behavior or you don't.
And if you don't and you're,

179
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,630
and if you're a part of a community
like that in a leadership role,

180
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:46,770
then they ask you to leave.
And so that was what was going on there.

181
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,590
Uh,
in that particular case,

182
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:54,550
I think she wanted more say so she
didn't want to be the assistant rabbi.

183
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:58,110
I don't know all the checks be
rabbis. Oh yeah. We have, haven't,

184
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,530
we have an assistant rabbi right
now arrived. Claudia who is amazing.

185
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,490
And this is rob, like the form like
doc, I'm sorry. Yeah, it's like rabbi,

186
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,060
Rabbi means teacher is a female you call
rob or is it distinction for a male as

187
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:17,230
well? No, you can call a a
male, a Ralph also see this

188
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,120
weird to me that you were like an anti
cult guy, but this is clearly, um,

189
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,950
at the very least a very strong
ideology with some pretty rigid

190
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,290
sort of classifications of things.
Is that, is that fair to say?

191
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,490
I mean Judaism as the one that you yeah,

192
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,280
it seems to go here and we'll get
started. Nobody makes me, it's fine. Uh,

193
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:46,850
it's not the typical interview that
I'm asked to do, but then again,

194
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:49,760
I didn't expect us to be. What is
it? Well, it's not just conversation,

195
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:54,560
really try not to interview
people. Yeah. Okay. Um, for me,

196
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,540
I just want to grow and,

197
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,110
and I like being part of a
group that's bigger than myself,

198
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:05,111
particularly one that's interested in
helping Boston where members of the

199
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,740
Greater Boston interfaith organization
where we're fighting for justice to raise

200
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:11,900
minimum wage to help,
uh,

201
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,820
get rid of agregious banking
fees on immigrants. Um,

202
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,830
we bring in pro Palestinian
peace activists to speak.

203
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:24,200
We bring in,
um,

204
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Steve Hassan to speak about costs to
all kinds of interesting programming.

205
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,600
And I love being part of a community.
And on a personal note,

206
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,100
when I had cancer nine years ago,
I had Hodgkin's lymphoma.

207
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,440
People were offering to drive me
to the hospital, make us meals,

208
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,110
and it was just great to feel like we
weren't alone facing that. That's great.

209
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,200
What I always hear from people that are
in Christian churches that really, uh,

210
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,130
really enjoy it.

211
00:13:57,131 --> 00:14:01,060
They really enjoy the community and they
really enjoy the bond that they have

212
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:01,990
with all these folks.

213
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:06,040
And that it seems like coming together
and sitting together on Sunday or

214
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,310
whenever you do it and
worshiping that really, in fact,

215
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,170
part of what's going on there is you're
all making this sort of agreement to

216
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:19,171
look at the possibility of there being
a higher good for all of us and that you

217
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:23,050
all joined together in this and
then you get this, this bonding,

218
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:27,010
this feeling of community that we kinda
don't really have that much in this

219
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:31,210
world. A lot of folks don't
know their neighbors. They
don't, you know, they just,

220
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,840
I have a buddy lives in an apartment
building, it's like 50 floors.

221
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,700
He doesn't know a fucking single person
in the entire building. Yeah. I'm like,

222
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,900
that's so crazy and isolated.
Hundreds and hundreds of people.

223
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:41,920
You don't even know who they are.

224
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,580
Right. And that's part of what
needs to be changed in my opinion,

225
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:50,300
and make the world a healthier place
where people do know their neighbors and

226
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:54,320
they do offer our help. Uh,
if, if somebody needs help,

227
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,920
beauty of small towns,

228
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,090
the beauty of less people is
those people get appreciated more.

229
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,940
It's sort of like a,
you know,

230
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,520
you can have too much stuff and then that
stuff doesn't have any value anymore.

231
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:12,790
Or you can have one cherished
item that like, wow,

232
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:16,840
this is the baseball glove my dad gave
me when I was 10 and I will cherish it

233
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:20,110
forever instead of like a fucking
warehouse full of baseball gloves.

234
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:21,280
They don't mean Jack Shit to you.

235
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:24,760
And I think human beings are kind of
a warehouse full of baseball gloves.

236
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:27,360
It's just so many of us that it's,

237
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,800
we sort of lose value.

238
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,590
We'll lose an appreciation for us
because there's so many of them.

239
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,390
Uh, that's part of it. I
also think that, you know,

240
00:15:36,391 --> 00:15:40,920
modern culture and civilization
and technology has created a,

241
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,100
uh, a false, um,

242
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,690
construct of what's
important and what's real,

243
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,720
where beingness and being part of a family
or a community or a tribe mattered as

244
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:57,810
a central theme of our identity.

245
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,310
Now it's consumerism and,

246
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,710
and what status you have at your job
or how much you're making or what car

247
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:07,560
you're driving and where
you're going on vacation.

248
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,160
And this information overload and sleep
deprivation that is very troubling.

249
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,790
Sleep deprivation. How so? Um,

250
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:23,070
it's probably one of the most studied
a phenomenon, the effects on the,

251
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,730
on the mind and on, um, on
the brain lack of sleep.

252
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,150
And it's one of the classic techniques
used by destructive cults by the way,

253
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:35,490
is sleep deprivation.
But if one analyzes American society,

254
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:38,880
my understanding is that the
average American is sleep deprived.

255
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,620
Isn't that one of the things that
Scientology supposedly does to those folks

256
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:46,100
that they have that work for pennies?
The, would they call them c Corp?

257
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,300
Uh, uh, it's the,

258
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,630
it's a C or c or billion year contract

259
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,260
billion. And that hilarious. You
signed a billion year contract.

260
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:58,950
Yeah. Um, and I want to
mention that I was part of a,

261
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,970
a five day seminar in Toronto a few weeks
ago called getting clear and some of

262
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:10,041
the top former officials of
Scientology were interviewed on stage.

263
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,180
I was on stage talking about hypnosis
cause Hubbard was a hypnotist and a lot of

264
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:20,181
the processes in Scientology or straight
out of a hypnosis textbook from the 20s

265
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:25,830
thirties which is when Hubbard was
reading about it, is like doing auditing.

266
00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:26,790
Such a mean.
Yeah.

267
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:31,791
So to sit with your feet flat on the floor
and your hands in your lap and you're

268
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,710
closing your eyes and just being there.

269
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,143
Okay.

270
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,440
Not Reacting for 20 minutes. The
Scientologists will tell you, oh Joe,

271
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:48,190
you just licked your lips
or your knee quiver. No,

272
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:51,360
you've got to just free is for 20 minutes.

273
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,410
It's creating an altered state
of consciousness known as trance.

274
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,080
And I know we're going
to talk more about trans.

275
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,740
I'm sure there's nothing
wrong with trance states,

276
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,220
but when you're in a trance state,
you're more suggestible.

277
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,570
Someone who has authority and who has
an agenda to implant ideas in your head

278
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,530
because you're not in your critical
analytic part of your mind.

279
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,670
So just sitting for 20 minutes with your
hands in your lap and your feet flat

280
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:25,090
would lead you to be more
influenced by someone suggestions.

281
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,660
It's the first one.

282
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:31,100
The next one is sitting opposite
of Scientologists three feet away,

283
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:36,101
staring into the Scientologists
eyes for 20 minutes.

284
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,510
That's the next step.
That's the next one that Jamie,

285
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:44,260
it's really hot in here cause ac on out.

286
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,330
And the next one after that is bull
baiting where you have to stare straight

287
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:54,401
forward and the Scientologists tries
to get you to react or respond.

288
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,580
It's like a bowl with
a red k. Really? Yeah.

289
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,430
So they are training obedience.

290
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,760
There di Di desensitizing people from
normal social cues and interactions and

291
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:12,290
they're cultivating a compliant,

292
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,580
obedient trans identity
as a scientologist.

293
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,141
I didn't know that.

294
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:21,770
Just staring at someone just staring
into someone's eyes can create an altered

295
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:23,920
state of consciousness. Can, a
bunch of kids are going to race,

296
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,550
actually staring at it.

297
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,370
The candle staring at a spot on a wall
of it's known in hypnosis language as an

298
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:32,920
eye fixation technique is of very,

299
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:37,840
very common technique for inducing an
altered state of consciousness. Why?

300
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:41,350
Because the eyes are pretty
wired to move and scan.

301
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:46,330
And when you, and I should
also say hypnosis is not sleep.

302
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,920
It's an altered state of consciousness
that's the best characterized as

303
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:53,770
concentration or absorption.

304
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,740
And um,
and I just want to say one more time.

305
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,800
There's nothing wrong with that state.
I liked that state. I do self hypnosis.

306
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:10,150
I do meditation,
I do many different altered states,

307
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,320
uh, techniques. The
point is I'm in control.

308
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,200
I'm deciding I don't have somebody who's
alienating me from my own inner voice

309
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:26,011
and my own self and trying to imprint
me with an a totalistic ideology that's

310
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:28,870
black and white. US versus
them. Good versus evil.

311
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,510
So let's talk about you. You,
you got into the moonies that's,

312
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,900
and you were there for two years, is that
what it was? Yeah. Two and a half years.

313
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,620
Two and a half years.

314
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,460
And that led you to try to get a
greater understanding of cults,

315
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:44,670
the cult mind control and to help people.
What was your experience?

316
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,290
How old were you in 19
is that what you were

317
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,220
I was a,
I had skipped

318
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,350
eighth grade.
I was an extra honors student.

319
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:53,860
I was a creative writing major at
Queens College. Humblebrag see that?

320
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,550
Just kidding.
Um,

321
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,580
so you were an honest reading Plato

322
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,520
eight. I wasn't too Utopian
novels when I was nine,

323
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:07,310
but aside from that Copia novels,
it was,

324
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,640
I was wanting an ideal world and looking
around at what I saw in the media and

325
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:15,680
the Russians are going to nuke us.

326
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:20,510
And already I was sensitized to
global climate change way back then.

327
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,830
I was in the last draft lottery
to go to Vietnam. Anyway,

328
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,730
I had been basically dumped
by my girlfriend checks.

329
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,890
I do it every time and I was kind of
bummed and I was sitting in the cafeteria

330
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:41,510
waiting for my new semester to start and
three women pretending to be students

331
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:43,100
stress like students carrying books.

332
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:47,720
Like students asked if they can share my
table and they started asking me about

333
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:51,470
the books and I had from
students. No, they were moonies.

334
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,570
Wow.

335
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:58,630
And it was a deceptive systematic
at which I later learned how to do,

336
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,780
uh,

337
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,780
as a leader I learned how
to recruit people and um,

338
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,950
I had a similar situation,
college to do, you know me well,

339
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:11,470
there was this Italian class that I
was taking, it was just beautiful.

340
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:14,460
Puerto Rican girl, check
glasses. She's so hot. Ooh.

341
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,220
And she was always asking
me to go to these parties.

342
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,650
She's always inviting me to these
parties, like, come to this, come on,

343
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,990
go on to the Cape for the
weekend. You should come. And
I was like, whoa. Oh my God.

344
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,990
But I was always busy. I was
so mad. I was like, fuck,

345
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:32,230
I got to find a date where I was busy too.
I was a waiter on the weekends.

346
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,330
What year is this?
I graduated high school in [inaudible] 85.

347
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,230
Um, I took a year off before
I went to Umass Boston,

348
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:44,470
a wasted three years just
fucking around there. That was a,

349
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:49,000
so he was probably 86,
86, even Church of Christ,

350
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,660
I don't know what church they were in
because they were hot and heavy that

351
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,060
period of time, it could
be in Boston. They were,

352
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,470
they were inviting me to these retreats
and they had invited me to more than one

353
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,380
and I couldn't go what I was about.

354
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,480
I was still competing in martial arts
tournaments back then. I was always busy,

355
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,960
but I really liked this girl. She's
pretty hot and she's very friendly too.

356
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:11,860
I was like, wow, maybe she's
the one really friendly, loving,

357
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,870
cute severity. This is how it
goes down. Um, there was a,

358
00:23:15,871 --> 00:23:19,140
an airplane crash in Boston and uh,

359
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,830
it was one of those weird
plane crashes where the, um,

360
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,400
did Trump have an airplane at one time
to Donald Trump have an airline? Maybe.

361
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,580
I don't know why we're connect
him to it and some strange way,

362
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,830
but whatever it was, this airline, um,
the way the wheels wouldn't come down,

363
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,860
you know how sometimes they make those
crazy landings where they skid across the

364
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:43,540
one way and the sparks fly and everything
like that. So I sat down with these, uh,

365
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,530
girls and, um, uh, we're at lunch
in the cafeteria and a, I go,

366
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:52,370
did you guys hear about the
plane crash? And they go, no,
what happened? And I said,

367
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:56,240
yeah, well some, uh, uh, the, the wheels
wouldn't, it was Trump airlines. Yeah,

368
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,070
that's what it was.
I'm pretty sure it was his,

369
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,080
you could probably find the actual
date that this happened. Finally,

370
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:07,040
actual date that Trump airlines, uh,
wheels wouldn't come down. So anyway,

371
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:10,820
it said Logan Airport in Boston, skids
parks, the whole might've been Boston,

372
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:13,790
it might've been somewhere else, but
I was living in Boston anyway. Boy,

373
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,410
am I getting off track these, uh, I,

374
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:20,600
I tell him the whole story then too,
by the way. So they go, what happened?

375
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,870
And I said, well, the wheels,
uh, didn't come down. And, uh,

376
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:26,600
they had a skate across the one way.
It was anyone hurt. I go, no, no,

377
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:31,130
no one was hurt. They go, oh, praise
God, praise God. And I just went, what?

378
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,240
It was just, it was weird. They all
clasp their hands together like this.

379
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,890
Praise God, pray. It wasn't like, wow,
whew, thank God nobody was hurt, you know,

380
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:44,360
which is like a normal expression.
But it was, it was a very pious,

381
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,620
like a devoutly religious praise God.
Oh praise God.

382
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,300
And I looked around, I go,
pray, okay, what do you guys do?

383
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,000
And then, and then I
started realizing, fuck man,

384
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:58,340
she didn't really want
me to come to a party.

385
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:03,340
Like there's something going on here and
save your soul man. Yeah. Well, and then,

386
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:06,830
and then I started asking him, I said to
you, you think God like saved that? Oh,

387
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:09,710
absolutely. I go, well, why didn't
God just make the wheels come down?

388
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:12,640
Why Freak everybody out? And
then quick question. And then,

389
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,200
and then it got weird and then it got
ugly and then they never talked to me

390
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:21,140
again. I forget where it
went. I was a dick back then.

391
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:22,250
I probably said something stupid.

392
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,740
Well, a lot of Bible Colts, uh,

393
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,660
Jewish Christian and
Muslim are into Armageddon.

394
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,860
You know,
the apocalypse is coming any moment.

395
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,480
It's a good way to get people to sign up.
Exactly.

396
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:42,880
The heavy pressure or scarcity
time's running out. If here, if,

397
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,140
if the world ended tomorrow,

398
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,950
are you ready or are you
going to hell for the rest?

399
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,790
Doesn't matter if it's ready or not. The
world's gonna end, you know, it's like,

400
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:56,940
are you ready to sign over your
real estate and your bonds?

401
00:25:56,941 --> 00:26:00,350
And so you're sitting at this table,
these girls come over.

402
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,000
They weren't even students, right?
So what are they doing in school?

403
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:07,090
How do they get in? They lied. They
just walked in Shane's colleges,

404
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,910
city university, shitty security.
Probably can't do that. And not only that,

405
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:13,550
but later when I got
recruited into the group,

406
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:16,910
I was told to drop out of
Queens college from the cult,

407
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:21,911
sent back to Queens College to start a
student group on campus to get people

408
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:26,000
into the student groups so they would
drop out of Queens. College does adorable.

409
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,710
It's very slick. So you're sitting
there at this table, you're bummed out,

410
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:33,380
you're broken hearted. What was the girl
broke up with you? What was her name?

411
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,960
Let's call her Debbie fucking shoe is
a shoe model. That's all I remember.

412
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,040
Model. She had great legs and
I have no recollection of what

413
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,020
her name is. Oh, okay.
Let's call her Debbie.

414
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,800
So Debbie tears your heart apart and uh,

415
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,100
just leaves you there at this cafeteria
alone. Vulnerable. Poor Steve.

416
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,880
You're like,
what now what now?

417
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,700
I thought she was going to be the one
and these gals come over and where are

418
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,534
they hot?

419
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,210
They were cute and they were very
flirtatious. They didn't say, by the way,

420
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,240
masturbation is a sin and father's going
to line us up with thousands of people

421
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,391
in the sign.

422
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:17,040
Who's who you're gonna marry and you
have to wait four years to have sex with

423
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:19,460
them. Was that the moonies?
Yeah. How they do it? Yeah.

424
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,610
They didn't say anything about
that. Well, so I, and I said,

425
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:26,400
are you part of some religious
group? Oh No, not at all.

426
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,020
We just a group of students who
are concerned about modern issues.

427
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,590
What was their approach to you? They sat
down, they started talking to you. What,

428
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:36,570
what, what did they, what
are they open up with?

429
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,350
Hey, nice classes. Mm, no, I think I had,

430
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:45,330
it was the spring semester. I had a
pile of books, I was taking philosophy,

431
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:49,890
psychology, writing a, I
think I had to partner shots.

432
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:53,550
I think I had Heidegger's being
in time and they were like,

433
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,960
why being in time is that thick.
Oh Wow. You must be really smart.

434
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,340
Uh, what is, what is that about?

435
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,360
So they start flattering you serious?

436
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,313
Yeah.

437
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,640
The call is known and other
cults are known as love bombing.

438
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,530
You know, Puerto Rican girl did to
me too. Damn. She was hot steam.

439
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,660
It's all about saving the person's
soul and you know, step by step,

440
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,270
incremental recruitment,

441
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,170
finding out as much as you can about
the person saying almost nothing about

442
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,150
what you are about and what the
group is about. Well unlike you,

443
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,090
I wasn't particularly
vulnerable at the time,

444
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:40,140
so it was a good time for them to get
after me cause I was in the middle of some

445
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:44,280
pretty intense stuff. My lab, I
had a goal, I was pretty focused.

446
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,860
I wasn't get roped up in some religion,

447
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,420
but if they got me a couple of years
earlier I think they could have gotten me,

448
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,820
I was real vulnerable when I was like 18

449
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,120
so the,
the reality is as,

450
00:28:56,121 --> 00:29:01,121
as human beings we have lifecycle events
where were situationally vulnerable,

451
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,720
death of a loved one, breakup
of a relationship. You know,

452
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:09,230
moving to a new city,
state or country illness,

453
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:14,300
there are things that every human
being goes through and for me is a

454
00:29:14,661 --> 00:29:19,661
overwhelming ignorance of the
public to kind of blame the victims.

455
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:24,440
Like you were stupid for believing in
this. Like what was wrong with you?

456
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:29,441
You are a week for falling for this as
opposed to tell me about your experience

457
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,560
and tell me what you know,
what happened.

458
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,910
You know there's a principle in social
psychology called the fundamental

459
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:39,440
attribution error.

460
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,950
I know that so a of of syllables but it
basically is the single most important

461
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:47,560
principle of social psychology.

462
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:51,070
And when it means is what I
was basically saying before,

463
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,360
when people try to understand why
other people are doing what they do,

464
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,880
they over a tribute individual variables
and they under attribute social

465
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:02,470
environmental variables,

466
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,950
social environment variables are gigantic.
I think that's correct.

467
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:10,010
One of the things about a person
being older and wiser like that,

468
00:30:10,011 --> 00:30:11,600
you always hear the
expression older and wiser,

469
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,950
but if you really look at it like
it mathematically, well what is it?

470
00:30:15,951 --> 00:30:17,030
It's data.

471
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,170
It's accumulation of data and the
understanding of the relationships between

472
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,940
events, reactions and consequences.
And when you're 18 years old,

473
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:29,900
you don't have a lot of data, you only
have a few things that are going on.

474
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:32,600
And for, for me, when I was 18, it was a,

475
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:35,890
the breakup of me and this girl
that I was dating and the uh,

476
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:38,270
all of a sudden becoming a man,
being responsible,

477
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:43,271
having to go to college or get some sort
of a job or some sort of a career and

478
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:48,430
just the, just the overwhelming
possibilities of the future and,

479
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:52,060
and not having any clue as to what,
how it was all going to play out.

480
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:54,440
I was terrified.
And if someone came along with bright,

481
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:56,240
then I feel like they could have got me,

482
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,090
I feel like I was real
vulnerable around 18.

483
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,830
But I met this hot Puerto Rican girl, I
think I was about 20. And I was pretty,

484
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:09,010
I was pretty determined at
that time, so I was okay, but

485
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,100
well not said that there were so many
different types of destructive cults.

486
00:31:13,101 --> 00:31:15,410
So they're not just all religious cults.

487
00:31:15,411 --> 00:31:19,730
There can be a therapy called clinical
called can be a cult of personality.

488
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,730
That's very important.

489
00:31:20,731 --> 00:31:24,690
That's very important because there's
a lot of different things that can lock

490
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:29,670
you in and then start to control you
and start to suck money off of you and

491
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:34,671
start to really dictate your
behavior in a very unhealthy way.

492
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:39,780
And that is so common.
There's so many different versions of it.

493
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:44,330
It almost seems to be like a pattern
of human behavior and thinking like a,

494
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,730
a code that you can kind of crack
like a cheat code and people.

495
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,903
Hmm.

496
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,800
We've experienced a revolution in science
and medicine and in psychology and in

497
00:31:57,151 --> 00:32:01,090
particular social psychology.
There had been so many, you know,

498
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:06,260
pivotal experiments in the last 50 to
100 years that give us windows into

499
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:10,530
understanding our vulnerabilities.
So for example,

500
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:14,170
when I'm counseling someone who's
involved with a destructive cult,

501
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,440
I don't start out by saying,
hey, you're on a call,

502
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,900
let me liberate you or something.
In fact,

503
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:21,900
my whole approach is empowering
people to think for themselves.

504
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,200
So I asked them questions with respect
cause I really want them to think about

505
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:31,260
it. In any case, I showed them
the asch conformity study,

506
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,990
a Solomon Asch.
What does that the,

507
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,380
so the Solomon asch conformity
study was framed to people coming

508
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:44,000
into it as a visual perception experiment.
Basically,

509
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:48,330
they'd be brought into a room with several
people in a semicircle and there'll

510
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:53,331
be a person in the front with
a card with four lines on it,

511
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,370
a sample line, and then three
other lines of different sizes.

512
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,610
Okay,
let's say a three inch sample line,

513
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:03,500
a three inch or four inch and a five inch,

514
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,420
but everyone is in on the experiment
except the person and seat six.

515
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,350
And after going around twice
giving the correct answer,

516
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:16,640
everyone confidently starts
giving the wrong same answer.

517
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:22,150
And the test is how many people will
start to conform to giving the wrong

518
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:27,200
answer, even though they
can see what their own eyes,
what the correct answer is.

519
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,980
And that study's been
replicated thousands of times,

520
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:35,981
and the answer is two thirds start giving
the wrong answer even though they know

521
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:41,711
intellectually that it's the wrong answer
because it feels too uncomfortable to

522
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:44,700
be in the room. And is that the, the,

523
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,700
the testimony that they give when
they are asked, what did they shoot?

524
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,110
Assuming the interview these people
absolutely. Yeah, it's uncomfortable.

525
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:56,111
And I even show a dateline and old
dateline episode where they asked Anthony

526
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,970
Pratt, Kansas is one of the
foremost social psychologists to,

527
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,850
to actually do the studies so
they could film it. And this,

528
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,660
they start out with the
Asian woman who is the,

529
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:09,110
her role at resistor who
gives the correct answer,

530
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:12,410
but she's grimacing as she's
giving the wrong answer,

531
00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:14,510
even though she knows
it's the right answer.

532
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,550
But because of the social forces we are,
have mirror neurons,

533
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:24,170
we want to fit in to the people in
the room. It's just human nature.

534
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,970
People survive. Exactly.
Clan behave. Exactly.

535
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:32,510
But it's hard wired.
So I show that video that,

536
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:36,760
that experiment and I always
like to ask people, so tell me a,

537
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,720
something you could do if you were in
that situation to scientifically reality

538
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:44,270
test that situation.

539
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,550
Scientifically Reality Test meaning
meaning what? You're in this room,

540
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:54,110
everyone's saying a five inch line is
a three in July. And what could you do?

541
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:58,110
Let me ask you, what would you do? Because
you have the data now. Okay, you're,

542
00:34:58,111 --> 00:35:01,860
you're a cult expert. You would,
I'd get up and measure it. Right,

543
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:05,420
but you would obviously understand
what's going on. Right? Exactly.

544
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:10,421
But if you asked me prior to my induction
into the moonies that I understand the

545
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:15,130
asch conformity study or the power of B,
I would have said, no, I'm an individual.

546
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,810
I'm a nonconformist.

547
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:22,811
I had the bumper sticker
question authority and I had
the ponytail and you know

548
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:28,460
the word unique
right in you rebel.

549
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,990
Totally. So anyway, after
the asch conformity study,

550
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:37,530
the Milgram obedience study,
Stanley Milgrim did a test at the time,

551
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:38,250
the dominant

552
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,660
theory in psychology for explaining
how the Nazis good do what they did was

553
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:47,550
called the authoritarians personality.
And Milgram's said,

554
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:50,700
I wonder if Americans would
do the very same thing.

555
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,030
And he developed this ingenious shock box,

556
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:58,050
which really was set of switches.
I had no electricity at all,

557
00:35:58,051 --> 00:35:59,610
but it sounded electrical.

558
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:04,050
And he basically would bring people and
tell them they're doing a scientific

559
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:05,910
experiment that's very important,

560
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:10,911
that tests memory and
punishment and learning and
set people up into a situation

561
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:15,990
where they thought they were giving
an electrical shock to the person,

562
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:19,110
the next room,
and it was all tape recorded with,

563
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,140
and it would increase 15 volts from mild
to moderate to severe to extreme to x,

564
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:27,720
x, x, x,

565
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:33,290
and there'd be a guy in a white lab coat
acting very proper who happened to be a

566
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,620
high school teacher who was
moonlighting a few extra bucks.

567
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,220
And the test was how many people would
electrocute of fellow human being in an

568
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,140
hour because an authority figure told
them they had to because they had made a

569
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:53,160
commitment to do a scientific experiment.
And the answer was two thirds.

570
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:54,531
Yeah,

571
00:36:54,531 --> 00:36:59,531
I saw a regular lab listen
to a radio lab podcast on,

572
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,920
on that very thing.
It's,

573
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:06,440
it's in fact there's a movie that's coming
out about it called the experimenter.

574
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,410
And the next study that
I'm about to mention,

575
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:13,290
the movie just came out a week or two ago
called the Stanford prison experiment.

576
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,030
The fills for Barnardo. Yeah. Who was
one of my mentors trying to get it.

577
00:37:17,031 --> 00:37:18,230
I was trying to get him on the podcast,

578
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:20,630
but I was out of the country when he
wanted to come on and I was really bummed

579
00:37:20,631 --> 00:37:23,370
out. Well, try to get them back.

580
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,420
Yeah.
I'm going to fly in this amazing,

581
00:37:25,421 --> 00:37:29,950
he taught a course at Stanford called
the psychology of mind control for 15

582
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:34,360
years and use two chapters of
my original book in it. Um,

583
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:38,650
and he was also president of the American
psychological association, but he,

584
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,980
so in his experiment he randomly divided
guys and to guards and prisoners and he

585
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:49,660
did basically controlled behavior,
information, thoughts and emotions.

586
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,680
And people started having nervous
breakdowns and some of the guards started

587
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:56,830
becoming sadistic. And instead
of saying, you know what,

588
00:37:56,831 --> 00:37:58,990
I don't want to do the experiment anymore.

589
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,320
They had gotten so sucked
into the experience that they,

590
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,440
that they're only out was to
have a nervous breakdown. Wow.

591
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,420
It was extraordinary.

592
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:15,870
So when I'm helping people understand
what happens in the Scientology called the

593
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:20,530
Mooney called the TM cult,
or any number of other destructive cults,

594
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,370
I want them to,

595
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:25,270
what's a TM called? Transcendental
meditation. That's a cult. Oh yeah.

596
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,740
Really big time.

597
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,370
I thought that was just like a
method of like cleansing your mind.

598
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,050
I didn't know that there was even a coat
behind. Oh, my Rishi. She yogi. Oh yeah.

599
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,973
This is not,

600
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,750
I'm a,
people practice it.

601
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,460
They practice techniques of transcendental
meditation alone by themselves.

602
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:43,294
So they in a cult.

603
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,560
So,
uh,

604
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:50,590
the answer is you don't need to be in a
room with other people to be in a mind

605
00:38:51,021 --> 00:38:52,160
control cult,

606
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:57,220
but it can get inside your head and
create a new cult identity that suppresses

607
00:38:57,831 --> 00:38:59,930
your real identity and it's not healthy.

608
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,351
Well,

609
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:03,650
I have a very cursory understanding of
transcendental medication meditation.

610
00:39:03,651 --> 00:39:08,180
So if you could please tell me
what exactly does that mean? So

611
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,140
cool.
Um,

612
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,180
and I have the story of a woman who was
raised in TM in chapter six of the new

613
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:17,430
book, Gina Catania. So, first of all,

614
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,460
there's a thousand or more ways to
meditate and there's not one way that

615
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:27,300
everyone has to meditate.
In fact, neurologically,

616
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,060
it's very detrimental for people to do,

617
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,750
for some people to do a mantra meditation
where they're repeating it over and

618
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:36,270
over,
it actually increases anxiety.

619
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,530
Really saw like Buddhist
meditations where they, oh,

620
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,970
so breath meditation. The
point is, is that it's a tool

621
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,430
for training consciousness.
And ultimately,

622
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:51,620
depending on your level of training,

623
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:55,550
you want to not be a victim of
your thoughts or your feelings.

624
00:39:55,551 --> 00:40:00,200
You want to not only develop
a perspective and a wisdom,

625
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,000
uh,
consciousness.

626
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:06,830
You want to also get out of the entire
frame of self dialogue and just,

627
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,360
and total being this.

628
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:13,490
But any group that says you
have to do it our way or else,

629
00:40:13,491 --> 00:40:16,460
or if you're having bad
reactions, they say, that's good.

630
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:18,300
You're unstressing keep doing it.
Yeah.

631
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,810
Is that what trends, denim
meditation? I'm afraid so. Well,

632
00:40:20,811 --> 00:40:24,710
when you say bad reactions,
how so? Let's Hicks,

633
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,940
headaches,

634
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:31,150
um, barking like a dog.
I've heard from some, uh,

635
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,910
Jamie, who would that instating. Um,

636
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,300
there person go wrote a book about
TM and some of the net negative after

637
00:40:39,301 --> 00:40:40,730
effects.
Um,

638
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,760
and what you need to understand about a
destructive cult is that that there are

639
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:46,170
many levels.

640
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:51,240
If you're just doing a meditation and
you're not doing the advanced than the

641
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:54,570
next advanced and then
becoming sell a bit and then,

642
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,990
oh,
that's all in transcendental meditation

643
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,180
goes.
And Maharishi was saying if we didn't,

644
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,390
if they didn't have 40,000 cities,

645
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:06,720
which meant people hopping around
thinking they were levitating,

646
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,000
that's hilarious.
The world would blow up.

647
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,030
So he was using the whole
fear trip thing to me,

648
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:17,010
raise a lot of money to get
people to be these devotions.

649
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:22,260
Yeah. This yogi flying.
It's is that, first of all,

650
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:24,390
how dare you? How dare you, this man,

651
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,580
these people are flying
and you're claiming bs.

652
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:31,990
You're very rare hopping on mattresses
today and they take a picture,

653
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,700
they're on the up, see, they're
flying. We've got the proof.

654
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,610
Someone is just like, you're poopooing
magic. Have you ever seen Jamie?

655
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,170
Have you seen it? Have you seen Yogi
flying? It's adorable. It's hilarious.

656
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:49,410
He's full. So I want to plug a
documentary. This here it goes. Yeah,

657
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,860
look at this. I mean,
no effort at all, right?

658
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,650
Phil Donahue actually edited
a show on this and it filled,

659
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:00,970
put his legs in Lotus and hopped.
Well, what's really funny is, wow,

660
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,140
I made amazing the Phil
can put his legs in Lotus,

661
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:07,670
but what's amazing is back when this
guy is getting tired, so his is hops.

662
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,110
Let's go back to the beginning.
Jamie.

663
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:14,100
His hops in the beginning were much
higher because he was fresh. Celia,

664
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:19,050
that kid's getting some air. Now let's
go a little bit further. Jamie, look,

665
00:42:19,051 --> 00:42:22,160
good luck. See right there. He's
getting tired. I'm a fight commentator.

666
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:26,900
I understand what people are fatiguing.
It's guys getting lactic acid flying.

667
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,320
It's but my hurry. She said, you know,

668
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:35,321
this raises the energy level of the
planet earth so that there were fewer

669
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,940
automobile accident and less war.
I feel for all these people.

670
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:41,640
I really do.

671
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,530
I feel for that guy right there with
the classes in front of this cat because

672
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:48,450
he's fucked. All these
people, they're fucked.

673
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:52,460
It's like social anxiety,
lack of friends,

674
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:56,270
and a lack of community and there's
so many different things that can lead

675
00:42:56,271 --> 00:43:01,190
someone to, to want to seek comfort
in these, these ideologies. And he's,

676
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,210
or they could have been born into it
or they could have been deceptively

677
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:09,320
recruited by a hot chick back to that guy.

678
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,340
But the the thing is,
is emotions.

679
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:17,700
If you're having doubts or if you're
having bad feelings, they're like,

680
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:22,910
it's telling you to like look at what's
happening and maybe you need to make a

681
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:23,750
change.

682
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:28,850
But if you're in the TM
movement and you're having
bad feelings about the group,

683
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,870
you're told that, that you need
to meditate to get rid of that.

684
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:35,570
And that's known as thought stopping.
That's one of the,

685
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:41,090
the techniques and the t of the bite and
model to shut down any reality testing

686
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,330
in the moonies.

687
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,770
We were taught to chance crush Satan
crush seat and crush Satan Rush,

688
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:52,770
Satan. It has a piece on
her. Gloria haven't of,

689
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,010
I want to tell you a true story.
Joe Rogan, but not be about Satan.

690
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,023
It is.

691
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:06,170
So I'm raised in a Jewish family.
We don't believe in Satan.

692
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:09,860
Okay. At all. You believe in God and the
Jewish family. Yeah. We'll wait a minute.

693
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:14,600
Hold on. If you believe in God, then you
have to believe in the god of the Bible.

694
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:16,160
Is that what you're defining goddess?

695
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,540
Now you're asking me to define
what I was believing as a child.

696
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,320
As a conservative Jew? Yes. I
guess so. The God of the Bible.

697
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,390
Isn't Satan in the Bible as well? No. No.
Satan is not in the Bible. No, not in the,

698
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,980
not in the toe run now.
Oh well that's a Torah.

699
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,940
That the new testament was a
invention later. Of course. Yeah.

700
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,340
Constantine. How many bishops,
right? Didn't he put it? 380?

701
00:44:41,341 --> 00:44:45,570
I believe it was. Yeah. So, um,

702
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,220
here's the story.

703
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:51,360
So I'm in the Frickin Mooney's if
I may curse cause I've watched,

704
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:56,050
I don't think it was, is not
a curse. Okay, good. I don't
think you said a curse. Uh,

705
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,450
the exorcist movie comes out. Oh, buses,

706
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:02,160
300 members,

707
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:07,161
including myself into Greenwich village
to watch the exorcist hard watched the

708
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:11,220
movie.
We all get in our vans.

709
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:13,890
Go to Terry town to the palatial estate,

710
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,220
and they have a palatial estate they had.
They had multiple ones.

711
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,180
This one particular one, a Terry town is
where I got a lot of my indoctrination.

712
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,070
It used to be owned by the Seagram's
family. Moon gets up and he says,

713
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,010
God,
the exorcist,

714
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:34,070
this movie is a prophecy of what will
happen if people leave the unification

715
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:38,640
church. Okay? Now, before we,

716
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:43,230
before he gave that speech, we were
singing holy songs for three hours.

717
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:47,310
That's after watching this
crazy excersice movie.

718
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,733
And,

719
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:53,820
and I only remembered the exorcist movie
for years after I got out of the cult.

720
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,840
And I was studying psychology and
we were learning about phobias.

721
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,780
And I was thinking
back, well, so what was,

722
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,660
how was I installed with phobias?

723
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:07,950
And then I remembered this movie
and this lecture and it's like,

724
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,250
holy crap,
I believed it.

725
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,960
Hundred Percent Satan was everywhere.

726
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,880
And only by being in God's
holy family. Yep, that's it.

727
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,210
And the head zips around
and levitates movie.

728
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,650
It's scared suck though in any way.

729
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:36,651
So how can an intelligent person from
an intact family who is going to be a

730
00:46:39,451 --> 00:46:44,451
professional writer and be a college
professor and get sucked into a cult that

731
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:48,600
wants to take over the world, make
an automatic theocracy, abolish,

732
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,860
say tannic democracy,
uh,

733
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:57,890
kill everyone that doesn't believe it
was literally what we were pretty much

734
00:46:58,021 --> 00:47:02,370
told by moon that, you know, we
needed to reclaim the earth for God,

735
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:07,200
not unlike Isis and a few
other cults out there.

736
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,783
Um,

737
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,610
I was told the Holocaust was necessary
because the Jews didn't accept Jesus.

738
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:19,050
Well, I had been educated about
the Holocaust I'd been and what,

739
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:23,280
I didn't mention Israel to the
Holocaust museum. When you heard that,

740
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,690
what was your reaction?
I had been so,

741
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:32,930
so mine in the extreme cult
example is a dissociative disorder.

742
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:39,430
I'm speaking as a mental
health professional and Steve
has since on a Milton and

743
00:47:39,431 --> 00:47:41,080
Estelle Hassan from flushing,

744
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:44,530
Queens became Steve Hassan,

745
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:48,850
son of some young moon and hock Jaha
and the true parents of the universe.

746
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:54,510
And he needed to be a clone
of moon and he was evil.

747
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:59,890
And my whole time in the group
was suppressing who I was.

748
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:04,330
It totally shutting
down any element of me.

749
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,580
I was sleeping three
to four hours a night.

750
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:10,600
I was working seven days a week for
no pay. I was recruiting people,

751
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,560
I was indoctrinating people, I
was doing political events, Ramon,

752
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:19,530
including fasting for Nixon during
the Watergate, fasting for Nixon,

753
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,260
fasting for Nixon because
God wanted him to be present.

754
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,850
That's how you know
you're in the wrong color.

755
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:29,050
So I'll tell you a quick funny story.
So my father voted for Nixon.

756
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:33,100
I voted for McGovern and we would,
my father was a business owner.

757
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:36,520
He thought Nixon was good. I said, daddy's
a cruck. How could you vote for him?

758
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:40,480
It's pathetic. I'm in the
cult. I call him up. I say,

759
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:44,530
dad were fasting for Nixon,
were in the capital,

760
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,030
and he says, Steven, you
are right. He's a crook.

761
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,070
I said, dad, you don't understand. God
wants Nixon to be president. He said,

762
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:58,450
now I know you're brainwashed.
He's a crook. I said, dad,

763
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:01,090
you just don't understand.
And how old were you at the time?

764
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,240
And this was when he was 19. 20. Yeah.

765
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,550
So I want to take it back to
the cafeteria if you don't mind.

766
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,340
So you sitting in this cafeteria,
these girls come up to you,

767
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:16,120
they start flattering you. They,
they, they're flirting with you. Um,

768
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,590
and then what's the next step?

769
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:22,591
So they're part of an international group
of students who are trying to make the

770
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:27,070
world a better place that happened to
have a house, kind of like a commune,

771
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,520
which was kind of interesting.
What I like to come over for dinner.

772
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:35,170
So it was the free dinner.
Would they cook?

773
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:39,470
I have no recollection.
And,

774
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,240
and it's interesting because back then

775
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:49,180
I was feeding them all the information
about myself, how I thought,

776
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,640
what my values were,
what my interests were.

777
00:49:51,641 --> 00:49:53,950
So I was telling them
how to manipulate me.

778
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,000
You say in this day and age you can
go on the Internet and read people's

779
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:01,300
Facebooks and all of their posts
and you don't even need to ask them.

780
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,430
You say this. Right? But, um,

781
00:50:03,431 --> 00:50:07,610
I'm assuming the girls you're talking
about are not much older than you, right?

782
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:12,160
So how would warrant them
being manipulated themselves?

783
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:15,760
Weren't they as essentially
a part of this whole thing?

784
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,720
And in that they were really
victims along the same way.

785
00:50:19,721 --> 00:50:20,860
They were making you a victim.

786
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:25,240
Like they were bitten by the vampire
from victimizer model and they're called

787
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:28,310
identity is,
we're suppressing.

788
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:32,540
They were sent away from Japan,
from their family and friends,

789
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:37,130
and they were Japanese chess. They
were Japanese checks. Right, right.

790
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,530
That's what's up. So, but
here again, um, but they were,

791
00:50:40,531 --> 00:50:44,810
we knew that they would have to
report each other if anyone deviated.

792
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:47,720
So that's why they would not
send people out individually,

793
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:51,150
like this tattle tale system.
But,

794
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,440
but my point being is if they were
not much older than you, if at all,

795
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:57,440
and they were also victims
of the same ideology,

796
00:50:57,441 --> 00:50:58,640
call it whatever you want to call it,

797
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:03,560
the why would they be looking
to manipulate you? Oh,
wouldn't it be a part of it?

798
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:08,150
So members were taught to
believe as they still are, right.

799
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:13,210
And enlarge that the world is headlong
into an Armageddon situation of any

800
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:17,300
moment.
Judgment Day is happening.

801
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:22,330
And as much as you can to bring
people into God and save their soul.

802
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:28,090
Saving a person in the moonies meant
saving 10 generations of their father's

803
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:32,570
ancestors that are in the spirit world
and their mothers and sisters and less

804
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:33,413
feral world.

805
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,680
And they're all looking at you all the
time hoping you're going to make good

806
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:42,590
decisions because if you
do good things for God,

807
00:51:42,591 --> 00:51:47,540
you're going to make good vitality
elements that will feed them in the spirit

808
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:49,490
world. And it got, I mean,

809
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:55,150
every culture has its own convoluted
yet internally a totalistic system.

810
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:02,570
So, but unlike Scientology, the
Mooneys or like save others,

811
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:07,460
Scientology is like, you know, become a
god and control everybody. Control matter,

812
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:11,540
energy, space and time and,
but we'll get people to do it.

813
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:14,810
You want them to do. Right.
But my point was that they,

814
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,070
these people were also manipulated, so
they knew that they were manipulating you,

815
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,590
but they didn't think that they
are being manipulated themselves.

816
00:52:21,591 --> 00:52:25,550
But at the same call, I think they
were trying to find information.

817
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,590
When you're at fault Joe, you're not
having that reflection of, right.

818
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:33,890
You know, of course server
looking back and going, hey,

819
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:36,920
what just happened just
then is no medic commenting.

820
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:40,330
It's like your program to think
the right way, feel the right way,

821
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:45,020
act the right way. And
um, you're self censoring.

822
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,270
And in my particular case,

823
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,260
I guess because I'm somewhat
competitive on some level,

824
00:52:51,261 --> 00:52:55,100
I know you have enough no relationship
to understanding what it feels like to be

825
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:56,390
competitive.
Uh,

826
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:02,290
I wanted to be the best Mooney I could
be chosen by moon and one of his right

827
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:06,800
hand people to be the
model leader in America.

828
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:11,830
So I was hand groomed to help take over
America and the world for two years.

829
00:53:14,811 --> 00:53:18,980
So this had to be a very quick
transition from you, Steve Hassan,

830
00:53:18,981 --> 00:53:23,930
normal college student to boom
full on fasting for Nixon.

831
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,070
Yeah.
I didn't mean it was very

832
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:26,551
fast.

833
00:53:26,551 --> 00:53:31,380
It was about two weeks after
my first contact to me,

834
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,150
uh,

835
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:38,150
having what I thought was a spiritual
experience and believing that I was being

836
00:53:39,421 --> 00:53:43,590
directed by God to this organization.

837
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:49,320
Wow. Yeah. So this madness
attribution happens a lot.

838
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:53,340
Now for some of my clients that literally
at a vulnerable point in their life,

839
00:53:53,341 --> 00:53:57,990
maybe their religious in there praying,
Dear God tells me what to do. You know,

840
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,510
should I leave my marriage?
But you know, what should I do?

841
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:04,260
And the next thing they know the
doorbell is ringing and it's a Jehovah's

842
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:09,120
Witnesses who want to study the Bible
and they're like, miss attributing,

843
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:13,380
thinking God just rang the doorbell as
opposed to these people are going ringing

844
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:15,900
every single doorbell within a six block.

845
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:18,020
Great.
Of course it's like my friend Gary,

846
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:22,250
he hits on every girl he meets his
ideas that if you swing enough pitches

847
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,450
[inaudible] you never know you're
going to it. It's like he'll, he's,

848
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,400
he had some girls way hotter than him,

849
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:32,390
just way above his head and it
never works out. But he's like,

850
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,350
you just got to keep swinging. He didn't
have her know. I'm always hopeful. Yup.

851
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,230
So that's what they're dealing
with and winging it. Every pitch.

852
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,130
Essentially they're,

853
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,730
they're knocking on every door and every
now and then they get that one ball

854
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:47,810
that's in the strike zone.
And that Steve Hassan sitting there.

855
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:52,100
What does pile of books? Well, in my case,
so I went to this three day workshop.

856
00:54:52,101 --> 00:54:56,240
I didn't want to stay, I was a
waiter on the weekends. I was busy.

857
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:57,410
I can't go on

858
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:01,170
on a weekend and they just kept saying,
it's going to be so great and Dah, Dah,

859
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,990
Dah.
I didn't even know it was a workshop.

860
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:08,470
And after two years of working at the
Holiday Inn in Hempstead as a banquet

861
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:10,070
waiter on the weekends,

862
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,360
I call up to find out when I'm supposed
to report it and he says, Steve,

863
00:55:14,361 --> 00:55:18,410
you won't believe it, but the wedding
was canceled. So take the weekend off,

864
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:24,680
man. I had just had this,
these women working on me all
week. And I was like, well,

865
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:28,520
maybe I'm too, well, I did
give them my word because,

866
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:32,210
but I gave him my word thinking f is
never going to have a weekend off.

867
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:37,580
And then I was kind of like, well,
maybe I'm meant to go. I should do this.

868
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:42,380
So I say, I'm okay. I'm free
for the weekend. Let's go.

869
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:43,760
And we're driving up.

870
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:48,170
It's a middle of the winter through
this palatial estate. And they say,

871
00:55:48,171 --> 00:55:48,651
by the way,

872
00:55:48,651 --> 00:55:52,190
this weekend we're having a joint
workshop with the Unification Church.

873
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,280
And I said,
what church?

874
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,280
Nobody said anything
about church and workshop.

875
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,980
Nobody said anything about a workshop.
What's up with that?

876
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:06,380
And they did the typical, turn it around
on you. Technique of Steve, what's,

877
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,340
do you have issues with Christians to do?
You uh,

878
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:17,030
uh, you biased against Christians? And
all of a sudden, now I'm on the defensive,

879
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:22,640
but there were no cell
phones back then in 1974,

880
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,150
uh,
it's a middle of the night.

881
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:29,200
I have an option of getting out in
the snow and trying to hitchhike.

882
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,940
I'm like, what am I, well,
just wait for the morning.

883
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:37,060
Just stay here and we'll
drive you back in the morning.

884
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:41,860
And they slid around your bed like sirens
while I was in a room where I wasn't

885
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:45,520
sleeping.
Yeah.

886
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:50,280
So you've learned a little
hypnosis. The Joe, uh,

887
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:54,850
in any case, the morning comes, the
van is laughed. Now what? Um, you know,

888
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:59,020
and I fucked, well let's just go
in and, and see what you think.

889
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:04,021
And it was all orchestrated cause I later
learned how to orchestrate it and how

890
00:57:04,211 --> 00:57:08,110
many people were in there with
you that were also new recruits.

891
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,900
So that was another trick,

892
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,780
a little bit of a scam because they had
people there that were acting like they

893
00:57:13,781 --> 00:57:15,400
were newcomers but they weren't

894
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:20,650
creating small groups where
there's the illusion of,

895
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,980
so essentially a lot like the study
where they have the one those alerts and

896
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:29,840
it's not in on the study. There
was, it was very systematic. Wow.

897
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,520
And it get so good at that
with this Mooney character.

898
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:37,820
How did he create all this?
So we want the,

899
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,790
the long shorts, the shorts, real answer.

900
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,410
Okay. A background in science and
psychology or something. Sure.

901
00:57:46,411 --> 00:57:51,250
I'm all so moon himself was
apparently in a cult and North Korea.

902
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:55,060
And it turns out that most cult
leaders were in a cult themselves.

903
00:57:55,061 --> 00:57:58,480
So they didn't learn the
techniques out of thin air.

904
00:57:58,481 --> 00:58:03,481
But the interesting thing about my
former cult was that the CIA set up the

905
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,020
Korean CIA because that had been two
coups in South Korea to that point.

906
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:15,310
And they were very worried about North
Korean brainwashing and they thought,

907
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:18,910
you know, we need to do something
to stabilize South Korea.

908
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:23,940
So they had this brilliant
idea of creating a private
group that would help to

909
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:29,350
reeducate political dissonance.
It's called victory over communism.

910
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:35,190
And I only know about this because there
was a Korea Gate investigation from 76

911
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:38,260
to 78,
um,

912
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,940
where the founder of the Korean ca
was interviewed and he said, he quote,

913
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,500
organized and utilize the Unification
Church for use as a political tool

914
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,630
unquote.
Wow.

915
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:54,970
And this was at the point where Americans
were getting fed up with Vietnam

916
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:56,650
wanting us to withdraw.

917
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:02,250
The hawks were very worried about and
like needing a stronger stance against

918
00:59:02,561 --> 00:59:05,140
communism. So they thought, oh yeah,

919
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:10,141
we need to have student groups on
campus saying we need to have a military

920
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:15,040
response to communists.
We should be in Vietnam.

921
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:17,860
And the moonies we use for that too later.

922
00:59:17,861 --> 00:59:21,010
I was part of the fasting for Nixon thing.

923
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,330
There was a whole political,

924
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:28,370
very shady piece here.
So you go from this,

925
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:33,410
you get out. How did you get out? How'd
you figure out that? It was all bad.

926
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,110
I was rescued by my family essentially.
Uh,

927
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,540
they didn't know where I was for a year.
Uh,

928
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:45,500
I drove into the back of a tractor trailer
truck on the Baltimore Beltway at 80

929
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:49,910
miles an hour in intro
and basically nearly died.

930
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:52,670
Broke my leg really badly,
fall asleep on the wheel or something.

931
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:54,050
Fell asleep three days,

932
00:59:54,051 --> 00:59:58,250
no sleep and two weeks
in the hospital sleeping,

933
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:02,840
eating away from the group.
I missed my sister Thea,

934
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,730
who was the only person in my previous
life that didn't say I was in a cult or

935
01:00:07,731 --> 01:00:11,480
brainwashed. She was always just like,
I love you and I don't understand,

936
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,430
this doesn't seem like you Steve.

937
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:18,410
I reached out to her not because I wanted
to leave but cause I missed her and

938
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:20,210
she was like,
you have two nephews.

939
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:23,780
I want them to know they were uncle
Steve Come and visit. And I'm like,

940
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:26,300
if you promise not to tell the parents,

941
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:30,950
I can arrange it because I'm
a leader and she promised.

942
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:35,300
And fortunately she broke her promise
and she told my parents and they hired

943
01:00:35,301 --> 01:00:38,590
some x members and they did a
deprogramming intervention with me.

944
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:41,660
Ex members of the moonies. Yeah. Wow.
So your parents went deep with this.

945
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:42,950
They knew what they were dealing with.

946
01:00:42,951 --> 01:00:47,480
They put everything on the table because
they knew they could have gone to jail

947
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:51,640
too if it didn't work. One of the, one
of the team was a woman I had recruited,

948
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,380
could have gotten the jail. Yeah. Why?

949
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,380
Because it's illegal to abduct and adult.

950
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,900
In my case,
I just took my crutches away.

951
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:07,850
I had a cast from my toes to
my groin abduction. Correct.

952
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:12,710
But uh, at the point that I said I want
to leave and they wouldn't let me leave,

953
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,740
I could have been something
about false imprisonment.

954
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,520
But the long and the short of it is,

955
01:01:17,521 --> 01:01:22,040
is I was so confident that what I was
doing was correct and that I wasn't

956
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:25,940
brainwashed and at a critical
juncture where we were,

957
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:30,110
they were moving locations cause the
cult was coming after me to rescue me.

958
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:34,040
My father's weeped,
she just started crying and said,

959
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:38,420
what would you do if it
was your son who quit?

960
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,650
You dropped out of school,

961
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:43,250
quit his job and during his bank account
and got involved with a controversial

962
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:44,690
group,
how would you feel?

963
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:50,120
And he was crying and I never saw my
father cry and it just touched the real me

964
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:51,360
and I could,

965
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:55,840
I build my cult self thought he was
brainwashed by the communist media against

966
01:01:55,841 --> 01:01:58,070
spot there.
But the real me was like,

967
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:02,990
dad really loves me and I want to
prove to him that I'm not brainwashed.

968
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:05,300
So I said, what do you
want me to do? He said,

969
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:07,610
I just want you to talk with
them for another four days.

970
01:02:07,611 --> 01:02:10,220
Like having an open mind
and if you want to go back,

971
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:12,680
at least your mother and I
will be able to sleep at night.

972
01:02:12,681 --> 01:02:16,790
Knowing we did the
responsible thing and I agreed

973
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:20,130
and I had this days

974
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,970
where they were teaching me about thought
reform in the psychology of totalism,

975
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:28,230
which was a book by Robert J lift and
about Chinese Communist brainwashing of

976
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:33,231
the fifties I had all of these experiences
that we're starting to surface that

977
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:37,490
had been suppressed at
during my leadership.

978
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,980
It's the same mechanism that
allows people to be inspired,

979
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,770
the same mechanism that allows
people to be manipulated.

980
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,960
You know that man mechanism
being you see something that's,

981
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,070
there's something about it that
makes you excited, like, like a,

982
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,660
a great performance,

983
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:55,260
a great concert or an athletic
performance we get out of,

984
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:59,310
they just feel inspired. A great book
that inspires you at manipulates your,

985
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:00,480
your brainwaves,

986
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:05,540
manipulates your consciousness and it
steers you in a certain direction is that

987
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:09,540
same sort of mechanism that allows
people to be influenced by others.

988
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:13,500
What allows people to be manipulated
by others in this form where you can

989
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:16,320
actually literally change the way
they think and view the world.

990
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:20,510
That's a big piece of it.
Is it sort of a law in the,

991
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,970
the beautiful thing about inspiration?
Is it a flaw in that?

992
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:26,870
Because inspiration is
beautiful. It's fuel, right?

993
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,630
Well, I think you need to have the
analytic part of your mind, right? And a,

994
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:35,520
and a consciousness that just because
it sounds great and looks great,

995
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,500
doesn't mean that it isn't

996
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,080
great. But you know what I'm saying? Like,

997
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:42,650
you know how sometimes things happen
and you're just carried away by them.

998
01:03:42,651 --> 01:03:46,460
Like you go see a movie and you're like,
God damn, I just want to go do something.

999
01:03:46,461 --> 01:03:50,320
I just feel so good. He's just like,
he got you. You know? Do you ever,

1000
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:54,170
do you see Braveheart? I have. I saw
brave heart man for like two hours.

1001
01:03:54,171 --> 01:03:57,290
I wanted a sword fight. After that
movie was over, I wanted to join.

1002
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,960
I'm like fruit. Um, you know, it's like
there's, there's those mine grow up

1003
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,340
with watching combat on TV and just,
you know,

1004
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:07,920
and I not see and yeah,

1005
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,440
I really wanted to fight.
What I'm trying to get at is there's,

1006
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:16,360
when you see things and when information
and data gets into your mind,

1007
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:21,340
it influences you in this very strange
way that can be positive and it can be

1008
01:04:21,341 --> 01:04:22,300
inspirational.

1009
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:26,740
Like whether it's seeing Michael Jordan
put on an incredible formats or Rhonda

1010
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,780
Rousey, you know, beating
someone or you know, those,

1011
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:33,580
those moments where someone does
something truly great, it's fuel. For you,

1012
01:04:33,581 --> 01:04:34,414
its fuel.

1013
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,320
Is that the same sort of mechanism that
they kind of tap into to change your

1014
01:04:38,321 --> 01:04:38,770
mind?

1015
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:43,420
Definitely. It's, it's a piece of the
emotional and the brain stimulation.

1016
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:46,330
So it's like the hack your mind.
It's kind of like hacking.

1017
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:51,440
I talk about in the book the via like
a virus that gets in and corrupts your

1018
01:04:51,481 --> 01:04:54,780
operating system. You still
have your original one, but the,

1019
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:58,290
now this malware has been
inserted and now you're working,

1020
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:02,640
you think that it's you,
but I thought it was Steve,

1021
01:05:02,641 --> 01:05:07,641
just the true Steve and that the
old Steve was the fall and Steve.

1022
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:13,490
But stepping back and getting perspective
and seeing the patterns of mind

1023
01:05:14,371 --> 01:05:18,490
control and manipulation in other groups.
And then reflecting

1024
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:23,490
back on your own experience is the one
of the basic tenants of what I do in my,

1025
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:25,601
in my work,

1026
01:05:25,601 --> 01:05:29,740
helping family members to rescue loved
ones are helping people who are either

1027
01:05:29,741 --> 01:05:33,790
born in a cult or recruited into a call.
So in a sense that this,

1028
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:37,240
this experience that you had when you
were 19 was incredibly beneficial for your

1029
01:05:37,241 --> 01:05:41,410
career. Ah, yeah. Um,

1030
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:45,010
I have mixed emotions when I hear
you say that, cause I didn't,

1031
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,890
I don't want to do this work
to be completely honest.

1032
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:52,390
Really, really, really.

1033
01:05:52,391 --> 01:05:55,240
You don't want it because you don't want
it to be work that it would be done.

1034
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:59,620
It's traumatic.
It's helping people who are suffering,

1035
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:02,620
but don't you get a benefit out of that?
I get,

1036
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:08,490
I get a fulfillment that I'm doing
something really helpful to individuals.

1037
01:06:09,401 --> 01:06:13,470
I'm trying to help people around the
world to understand this phenomenon.

1038
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,830
I'm trying to counter some of the
major forces against totalitarianism,

1039
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:22,030
but to suggest that,
you know, wow, you know,

1040
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:25,830
you have the moonies to thank for Korea.
Oh,

1041
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,720
I'm saying it's beneficial for
you having a negative experience.

1042
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:33,670
You don't have anyone. So it's, it's, it's
a wounded healer model. Yes, yes, yes.

1043
01:06:33,671 --> 01:06:38,671
It definitely deepened to me in a way
that I could not have been deep before

1044
01:06:38,771 --> 01:06:43,030
because when you wake up from being
in a group like this, the shame,

1045
01:06:43,031 --> 01:06:45,460
the embarrassment,
that confusion,

1046
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:50,230
I felt like I didn't know who I was.
I didn't know what was real.

1047
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:57,100
I literally had to have my family and
my friends show me videos of who I was

1048
01:06:57,101 --> 01:06:59,480
before to remind me,
wow,

1049
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:04,720
what I needed to go to places that I
used to go to. Like I had a belief,

1050
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:08,910
and this is very common and I want
to touch on Stefan Molyneux, uh,

1051
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:13,540
which is how I learned about you
seeing your interview with him. But,

1052
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:17,260
um,
I believed I had an abused childhood.

1053
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:22,210
It was part of how they
conditioned this new cult identity,

1054
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:27,211
suppress my old identity as they poisoned
me against my past and what coded

1055
01:07:27,581 --> 01:07:31,120
everything. So what did they tell
you happened about your childhood?

1056
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:36,220
It wasn't that someone stood
over me and told me, but it was,

1057
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:41,310
it was part of the whole
indoctrination system,

1058
01:07:41,681 --> 01:07:45,910
listening to other people, talking about
abuses in their families, et cetera.

1059
01:07:45,911 --> 01:07:50,440
But I literally, when I first got out
of the group, I thought I was miserable,

1060
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:53,980
depressed,
that my father was physically abusive.

1061
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:58,540
And when I said to my sister while dad
was physically abusive, she went, what?

1062
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:03,880
You really thought it? Yes. Wow. Yes.

1063
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:07,570
But what you have an actual image in
your mind of your father doing it.

1064
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:12,640
So one real memory that
everything else was built off of.

1065
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:16,100
And it was an actual event that happened.

1066
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,930
I think I was 11 or 12.

1067
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:22,880
My father wanted to know where the
change was for lunch and I had bought

1068
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:27,410
baseball cards or something and I
lied and my father slapped my face.

1069
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:32,240
That was the one true. And that
was the one time my father had me.

1070
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:37,550
Um, but I really believed
it and my sisters were like,

1071
01:08:37,551 --> 01:08:41,590
dad never hit us because his father beat
the crap out of him. He never, you know,

1072
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:45,320
that that's issue wasn't,
you didn't want to hug us or hold us,

1073
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:47,570
but that was not physically abusive.

1074
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,590
So just one moment where
he lost his patient. Yeah.

1075
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,190
Formed false memories based on that.
Right.

1076
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:59,120
And what what Scientology does is
they have you go back and, and,

1077
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:01,960
and remember abuse from the past,

1078
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:04,480
but then once you're done
remembering whatever,

1079
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:06,970
then you go into your past
lives to remember all the

1080
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:10,560
abuse. That's where it's really, and
it keeps going on and on, don't they?

1081
01:09:10,561 --> 01:09:12,570
When they're doing that
and that auditing process,

1082
01:09:12,571 --> 01:09:16,930
aren't they trying to get you to let
it go? Like isn't the idea that you,

1083
01:09:16,931 --> 01:09:21,480
you were repeat a traumatic event so
many times that it means nothing to like,

1084
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,970
like if you've ever been around
someone who doesn't swear,

1085
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,720
like you're your grandma or something like
that and she says, fuck you. Like Whoa,

1086
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,090
what the hell?
Like your grandma doesn't swear,

1087
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:33,720
but if you're around one like Jamie,
this kid's got a total potty mouth.

1088
01:09:33,721 --> 01:09:35,880
It just comes flying out of him.
You know what I mean?

1089
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:38,850
Like if you're around certain people,
they swear all the time, it seems normal.

1090
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:40,350
And in the word lose its meaning.

1091
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,360
It just becomes a part
of the normal vernacular.

1092
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:46,740
But if you're around someone
and it's very, very, very rare,

1093
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,800
it becomes like this,
this big moment. Well,

1094
01:09:49,801 --> 01:09:51,840
the idea being that you repeat this thing,

1095
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:55,800
this event over and over and over and
over again, so it loses its meaning,

1096
01:09:55,801 --> 01:09:56,820
it loses its impact.

1097
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:58,500
So is that what they do?

1098
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:02,190
So that there's a qualitative difference?

1099
01:10:02,191 --> 01:10:05,640
We'll change the sensitization
around a word or something.

1100
01:10:05,641 --> 01:10:10,641
And actually trauma processing harbored
was using a very old model of Catharsis

1101
01:10:11,761 --> 01:10:16,290
that you have to remember the abuse and
you have to reexperience the abuse over

1102
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:17,310
and over and over again.

1103
01:10:17,311 --> 01:10:22,311
And that's been thrown out by the
mental health profession decades ago.

1104
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:23,820
Why?
Because you're,

1105
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:28,880
you're revictimizing people having them
suffer the experience over and over and

1106
01:10:29,431 --> 01:10:34,050
over again. If I want to help someone
who's been abused, I tell them,

1107
01:10:34,051 --> 01:10:38,150
you have to be in your body in the
here and now, and you have, uh,

1108
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:43,110
a window or a TV screen seeing
the younger you, but you're safe.

1109
01:10:43,111 --> 01:10:43,950
You're here.

1110
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:48,690
The abuse happened over there and I don't
want them to have associated memories

1111
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:52,560
of abuse.
I want them to know that they're safe,

1112
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:56,040
that that did happen. But it's not, it's,

1113
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:58,650
it's just incorrect to think the,

1114
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:03,450
the brain and the emotions are battery
and all you need to do is drain it and

1115
01:11:03,451 --> 01:11:04,960
then it's gone.
It's just not,

1116
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,370
isn't a,
but it doesn't work.

1117
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:12,790
These theories about how to
approach a various past traumas,

1118
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:16,950
traumatic incidents, these theories
are a, essentially a variable, right?

1119
01:11:16,951 --> 01:11:19,860
Like what work work with one person
might not necessarily work with another

1120
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:24,060
person. And a lot of these ideas
that you put into practice,

1121
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:27,440
I mean, don't they? I mean,
aren't there flexible?

1122
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:30,750
There have been therapy colts.

1123
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:35,610
We were open this up by talking about
different types of cults and if any

1124
01:11:35,611 --> 01:11:39,690
ideology that's black and white in
that you're trying to compress human

1125
01:11:39,691 --> 01:11:44,640
experience into the ideology is
worrisome because no one model is,

1126
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:48,420
is true. Everyone's different,
everyone's different. But the,

1127
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:53,460
the goal as a therapist is do no harm
and empower the person to be functional,

1128
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,960
right?
It's the goal isn't to trauma process.

1129
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:03,620
So in the last few years I've been trained
in a form of attachment therapy where

1130
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:10,080
we're people,
people who have personality disorders,

1131
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:11,870
which were hitherto,
um,

1132
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:16,590
believe to be like permanent can
actually be cured in two to three years.

1133
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:22,070
And the technique is basically using
hypnotherapy technique where you're asking

1134
01:12:22,141 --> 01:12:27,141
the person to go back to a key traumatic
moment in their childhood and imagining

1135
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:33,290
asking them to imagine if they had the
ideal mother or the IDL father that was

1136
01:12:33,511 --> 01:12:38,511
uniquely suited to them and they did
exactly what you wanted them to do in that

1137
01:12:39,811 --> 01:12:44,760
situation and ask their
imagination to fill in the scene.

1138
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,990
You do it, you, you,

1139
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:53,190
the person literally can create a
positive reference point of safety,

1140
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:59,620
of security, of love,
of a tea, of connection,

1141
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:04,120
all the things that children
need to experience to have
a sense of how a healthy

1142
01:13:04,121 --> 01:13:09,121
sense of self and people
know that they were abused,

1143
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:15,210
but they're repairenting to use another
term there internally using their

1144
01:13:15,341 --> 01:13:18,610
imagination,
their repairenting themselves.

1145
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:23,560
And what we is now proven
neuroscientifically is there's, there's,

1146
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:23,910
um,

1147
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:28,910
neurogenesis and neuroplasticity to the
point where people can know that they

1148
01:13:29,591 --> 01:13:31,060
were abused,
remember it,

1149
01:13:31,061 --> 01:13:35,740
but they can act as if they
had that healthy mother and
their healthy father and

1150
01:13:35,741 --> 01:13:36,940
a healthy childhood.

1151
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:38,130
Yeah.

1152
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:42,930
And be functional. It doesn't not
seem to know it works. It works.

1153
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:43,883
It works.

1154
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:48,350
Act as if they believe,
I mean this sounds like fantasy.

1155
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:49,760
Am I reading it wrong?

1156
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:53,360
MMM. So, well,

1157
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:56,700
it's interesting for me to
hear you frame it like that.

1158
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:01,940
People are not coming out of a therapy
like that thinking that they had a great

1159
01:14:01,981 --> 01:14:06,000
childhood. Right. But they're
no longer walking around,

1160
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:11,320
bleeding all over the place.
Afraid to trust somebody. Uh,

1161
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:12,340
having self

1162
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:16,630
doubt, unable to touch and have
sexual contact. That's, that's,

1163
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:21,660
that feels good because they've created
these reference experiential states from

1164
01:14:22,411 --> 01:14:23,380
themselves.

1165
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:27,940
Now these reference experiential
states that they create these,

1166
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:32,941
these theories and these practices of
therapy that someone has to invent these.

1167
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,640
Like someone has to look at the problems,

1168
01:14:36,641 --> 01:14:39,850
you have to figure out what's the best
way to approach these things and come up

1169
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:42,790
with an idea and hope that it works.
And as you said,

1170
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:46,570
there's like the l Ron Hubbard
methods that he was using that he,

1171
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:47,710
that were really ancient,

1172
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:50,470
those they thought that was
going to work and it didn't work.

1173
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,210
Yeah. And he was never a
medical health professional,

1174
01:14:53,211 --> 01:14:56,840
but he was arrested for practicing
medicine without a license.

1175
01:14:56,841 --> 01:14:59,210
And they did call it a religion to try to

1176
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:04,090
right in the birthday. But this,
these, these ideas, they're,

1177
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:04,801
they're essentially,

1178
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:08,250
people come up with ideas of how to
treat people that have various elements,

1179
01:15:08,251 --> 01:15:12,300
right. They, they, they, and they, and
then they apply them to people. I mean,

1180
01:15:12,301 --> 01:15:15,720
how do they practice this stuff? I mean,
this is not like something like, hmm,

1181
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:17,980
I need to figure out how
to chop this tree down. Oh,

1182
01:15:17,981 --> 01:15:21,870
I'm going to try to invent an acts like
in, in what I'm saying. In my case,

1183
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:26,950
I was out of the cult for four
years when I first, um, um,

1184
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:31,900
so a, a formal hypnotist
do a trance on somebody.

1185
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,430
And my reaction was I used to do
that when I was doing lectures.

1186
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:41,560
Like I had no awareness that I had
been taught to do hypnotic methods.

1187
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:46,561
I was told to model the older brothers
and it was kind of a behavioral modeling

1188
01:15:47,981 --> 01:15:48,814
kind of thing.

1189
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:53,740
And I started wanting to learn hypnosis.

1190
01:15:53,741 --> 01:15:58,240
I wanted to understand what it was,
what it was and how to do it ethically.

1191
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:03,900
And essentially there has been a lot of
trial and error and a lot of people have

1192
01:16:04,211 --> 01:16:06,280
gotten hurt by the misuse of it.

1193
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:11,340
But if you're in a professional
organization with as a
strict code of ethics

1194
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:17,610
where there are clear boundaries and
people can trust that you're there just to

1195
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:22,840
help them and they have, it's
not about keeping you as a, as a,

1196
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:24,310
as a client forever.

1197
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:28,030
It's like the faster you can get out
of treatment and just live your life,

1198
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:32,950
the happier the therapist is. And the
more you can teach the person about how,

1199
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:37,570
how to know themselves and how to
control their feelings or control their

1200
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:38,680
thoughts,
et cetera.

1201
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:44,130
The better what is happening right now
in Europe because the socialized medicine

1202
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:46,361
is,

1203
01:16:46,361 --> 01:16:51,361
they really are testing a lot of these
approaches and demonstrating that people,

1204
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,591
for example,

1205
01:16:53,591 --> 01:16:58,591
with narcissistic personality disorder
actually get cured after two to three

1206
01:16:58,961 --> 01:16:59,794
years.

1207
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:10,070
But coming back to my work, when
I was, when I was first doing

1208
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,750
this work and I was uh, uh,
struck by people who is saying,

1209
01:17:14,751 --> 01:17:16,760
but you are recruited at 19,

1210
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:19,850
you had an identity before
I was born into the group.

1211
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:22,310
I don't have a pre called self.
What do I do?

1212
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:27,720
I didn't know what to say to them
other than make one up. Right,

1213
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:32,120
and they started doing
that now 39 years later.

1214
01:17:32,121 --> 01:17:36,650
It's actually a treatment modality and
I'm not, I'm not taking credit for it.

1215
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:37,484
I'm just saying

1216
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:39,920
a successful,
happy,

1217
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:44,720
positive childhood free of this
ridiculous confining ideal.

1218
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:47,250
It's like if, if you're, if you're

1219
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:52,080
real life is this story
line you're making,

1220
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:57,100
he's making some create an alternate one
spaces fingers as a as a default where

1221
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:04,221
instead of a parent beating beating you
when you're asking for help or saying

1222
01:18:06,841 --> 01:18:11,310
you're being a sissy, but you have
someone saying, tell me what's wrong,

1223
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,200
let you know you need a hug,

1224
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:17,970
and they're visualizing that and feeling
like there's someone who's really there

1225
01:18:17,971 --> 01:18:21,030
for them. That's an anchor.
That's a good role model for them.

1226
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:26,480
It really can enable them at the point
that they're parenting their children to

1227
01:18:26,581 --> 01:18:29,600
not just reenact the, the, the,

1228
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:34,610
the modeling that they learned and beat
the crap out of their kid but actually

1229
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,920
behave like a healthy person would.

1230
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:43,020
[inaudible] it seems to me
that it's beautiful that
all these theories are being

1231
01:18:43,031 --> 01:18:45,440
developed and tested
and applied its beauty,

1232
01:18:45,441 --> 01:18:48,610
but it seems to me like it's all a
work in progress. Is that an incorrect,

1233
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:52,990
like it's not like there's any hard fast
method for definitely curing people of

1234
01:18:52,991 --> 01:18:56,230
weird psychological ailments
are caught like thinking. I,

1235
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:59,870
I think where I think the
human species is evolving,

1236
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:04,280
I think we're very at a very low
level of evolution in terms of our

1237
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:07,580
understanding of things. However, um,

1238
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:13,840
people are able to get out of the most
horrendous abusive childhoods and be

1239
01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:19,241
functional and not just commit suicide
or be drug addicts would be psychotic and

1240
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:20,660
a mental ward,

1241
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,960
but they're able to function and in
what we're learning about the brain is,

1242
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:31,430
is, is just wonderful. I'm excited
about the future in terms of that.

1243
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,000
That said,
there's a huge potential for abuse.

1244
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:39,490
Now you technique by you saying that
you don't like doing it and it's just,

1245
01:19:39,491 --> 01:19:41,920
is it just because it's too taxing on you?
It's,

1246
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:45,100
or is it because you really wish that
this wasn't something that you really

1247
01:19:45,101 --> 01:19:48,550
needed to do? Correct,
right. Yeah, I mean,

1248
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:52,140
we can all sort of empathize with that.
I mean,

1249
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:57,280
of course anybody who has children will
look at, uh, you love your children.

1250
01:19:57,281 --> 01:20:01,090
You look at people who were
abused as children are abused by,

1251
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:04,650
especially by their parents. And it's
just this unbelievably painful thing to,

1252
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,250
to here in,
forget about witness or be a part of,

1253
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:11,880
but to hear about someone being beaten
by their parents or f, you know,

1254
01:20:11,881 --> 01:20:13,260
abused in some sort of a way.

1255
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:16,650
I had my friend Barry Crimmins
on the podcast yesterday,

1256
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:21,600
a great standup comedian from Boston,
and he has a new movie that's out today.

1257
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,400
It's called call me lucky that,
uh,

1258
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:27,300
Bob Goldthwait directed
and it's about his, uh,

1259
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:31,590
he was raped when he was four by his
babysitters boyfriend. They would,

1260
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:35,880
you know, multiple times. And this
is horrible, horrible, horrible,

1261
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:40,380
traumatic story and a big
part of his life as his,

1262
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:44,940
his perseverance and overcoming this
thing that happened to him when he's four.

1263
01:20:44,941 --> 01:20:47,670
He's 62 years old now. Right.
You know what I mean? This,

1264
01:20:47,671 --> 01:20:52,671
this trauma has sort of like defined
him in some ways and strengthened him.

1265
01:20:53,251 --> 01:20:55,800
And other ways that he, his,
his ability to overcome it,

1266
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,200
showing his perseverance but fuck

1267
01:20:58,340 --> 01:20:58,860
right.
And,

1268
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:03,350
and often people who have been
suffering a trauma like that,

1269
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:05,300
if they become comedians,

1270
01:21:05,301 --> 01:21:09,560
they're compensating to
try and balance the pain

1271
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:12,180
and maybe call it members.
Right.

1272
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:16,660
Because that would be someone who'd be
vulnerable for someone who, you know,

1273
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:22,580
would have some reaching for a
utopian view of the world or some,

1274
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:26,820
some better way. Cause you
know, the horror of the abuse.

1275
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:31,300
Yeah. So a lot truth is, is that the, the,

1276
01:21:31,301 --> 01:21:36,301
the bigger cults don't want people who
are seriously emotionally disturbed

1277
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:40,190
because they can't control them.
If they're serious,

1278
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:44,090
seriously disturbed.
They don't want them.

1279
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:46,220
You want your money,

1280
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:50,980
but they don't want you on staff and
they don't want to to be part of the PR.

1281
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:54,420
So did the, Oh, okay. So do they have
like hierarchies like say a funeral, Lee.

1282
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:56,690
So have you joined Scientology or
something like that? Here's your book.

1283
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,400
I'll show you that if you,
uh,

1284
01:21:58,401 --> 01:22:01,670
if you go to Scientology and they did
give you one of those personality tests,

1285
01:22:01,671 --> 01:22:03,560
which I took by the way,
it's hilarious.

1286
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:07,910
They make you hold on these Folgers
coffee cans. And this is the pyramid,

1287
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:08,991
right?

1288
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:13,880
So if you're in the CR gear in
the upper quadrant of the pyramid,

1289
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,930
the leader Tom Cruise, you're in the
fringe. He's a friend. She's not a leader.

1290
01:22:17,931 --> 01:22:21,080
I think he's a leader. I think you're
wrong. I think you got a metal dude.

1291
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,310
He did gold metal. Yeah.
But he's, he's not staff.

1292
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:29,930
He's more like a symbol and it gives tons
of money and he's good for recruiting,

1293
01:22:29,931 --> 01:22:32,600
but he's not running the group.
What do you think's going on with that?

1294
01:22:32,601 --> 01:22:35,780
You think he's gay?
Uh,

1295
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:42,650
uh, I've yet to hear an
argument against it by,

1296
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:44,750
I would say John Travolta.

1297
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:49,560
Apparently it's by John's
gay and he's buy toms by. Uh,

1298
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,310
that's my impression.

1299
01:22:52,311 --> 01:22:57,311
But I have not heard from any farmer
Scientologists through just accept being

1300
01:22:57,351 --> 01:23:00,740
gay. Would Scientology go away
immediately? Well, that's homophobic.

1301
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:03,890
It's totally homophobic.
Moonies oh yeah.

1302
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,150
It's a degraded human being.
If you're gay. In fact,

1303
01:23:07,151 --> 01:23:11,620
cupboard San Quintin was gay and
he killed himself all his murder.

1304
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:17,080
So when you saw going clear,
were you happy that, um, uh, I'm,

1305
01:23:17,081 --> 01:23:19,680
I'm in the middle of the book right now.
It's God damn amazing.

1306
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,450
It's amazing when you go over l Ron
Hubbard pass and how absolutely ridiculous

1307
01:23:24,451 --> 01:23:28,500
it was, how many times he lied about
things, all the nonsense. And he said,

1308
01:23:28,501 --> 01:23:32,550
and all the different times he was caught
lying and all the different people in

1309
01:23:32,551 --> 01:23:37,470
his life that he would just make up crazy
stories about being this world war two

1310
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:42,600
hero was God.
He was blind and he's completely crazy.

1311
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:43,770
Completely crazy.

1312
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:49,070
It's amazing that a guy that's that
damaged could get that many people to buy

1313
01:23:49,531 --> 01:23:51,560
his nonsense.
And it is.

1314
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:55,150
So, um, Larry, right?

1315
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:59,770
And Hbo did a documentary based on that.
Yes, Larry, right? Janet, right man,

1316
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:04,450
they all took their material from my
friend John a tech who was a former member

1317
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:09,451
OT five who wrote a book called a piece
of blue sky and John and put together

1318
01:24:10,301 --> 01:24:14,440
this, this, uh, conference in
Toronto called getting clear.

1319
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:19,530
The website's getting clear.co
and we debunked not only Hubbard,

1320
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:24,820
but the entire policies
inside the organization.

1321
01:24:24,821 --> 01:24:28,690
I was explaining mind control and
it's going to be made live on,

1322
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:32,530
on the Internet that people
can watch while this,

1323
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:37,660
the reason that he did this and why I
encouraged him to do this was people were

1324
01:24:37,661 --> 01:24:42,661
leaving David Miscavige's
Church of Scientology but
starting their own splinter

1325
01:24:43,151 --> 01:24:47,770
group of Scientology where they were still
idolizing Hubbard and still doing the

1326
01:24:47,771 --> 01:24:52,450
tech and we wanted it to bunk the
whole thing from start to finish.

1327
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:55,420
And I think it was done very masterfully.
Okay.

1328
01:24:55,670 --> 01:25:00,670
So they were starting like subgroups
where they came up with their own stuff.

1329
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:02,660
They would do it. They
were taking, they were on

1330
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:07,410
well automatic pilot of all these
[inaudible] closer up to your face. Yeah,

1331
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:12,250
I, yeah, sorry about that. No
worries. Um, so for example,

1332
01:25:12,251 --> 01:25:14,410
the number two man, number three, man,

1333
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:18,790
Marty Rathbun and Mike Rinder had left
the group and we're spelling all the

1334
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:22,630
secrets of what, you know, all the
criminal activities that were being done.

1335
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:28,050
They were creating independence
Scientologists and trying
to keep doing auditing

1336
01:25:29,201 --> 01:25:33,850
and keep doing the processing. And
it's like, dude, come on, like wake up.

1337
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,890
The whole system was
warped and weird and like,

1338
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:39,950
so they were trying,

1339
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:43,620
were they trying to like find some
beneficial aspects of what they had based

1340
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:45,150
most of their life on?
Is that what it was?

1341
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,850
Were trying to salvage some of it right,

1342
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:50,840
but like there,
if to use the cult identity thing,

1343
01:25:50,841 --> 01:25:53,930
they're called identity was trying
to re, you know, Redo things

1344
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:55,840
that Miscavige guys a trip.

1345
01:25:56,050 --> 01:26:00,760
[inaudible] listen to him talk and those
conversations and especially that giant

1346
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:04,190
speech that he gave,
you know when they got tax

1347
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:06,950
free status,
like wow,

1348
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:12,100
that was a really good book by
Tony Ortega who has the blog.

1349
01:26:12,411 --> 01:26:16,460
If anyone listening wants to know about
Scientology, it's Tony or take it out.

1350
01:26:16,461 --> 01:26:20,510
Or he wrote a book called the unbreakable
miss, lovely about Paulette Cooper,

1351
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:25,870
who was a friend of mine when I left the
moonies in 1976 she wrote a book called

1352
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:27,830
the scandal of Scientology.

1353
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:33,250
And the book is all about her life story
and how this group harassed the hell

1354
01:26:33,561 --> 01:26:35,440
out of her Scientology.
Yes.

1355
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:39,680
Because she told the truth about
Hubbard and and the organization,

1356
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:42,410
and Hubbard said, never
defend, always attack,

1357
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,920
and they did all these criminal
activities systematically,

1358
01:26:45,921 --> 01:26:50,020
which still goes on to this day.
So wait,

1359
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:54,440
I'm having a book release party after
this and you're invited if you want to

1360
01:26:54,441 --> 01:26:59,040
meet some of the people in
the going clear handle it. I,

1361
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:01,910
I'm too busy today.
No worries.

1362
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:07,370
You're doing something at the sea
bound theater. Yes. Tomorrow night,

1363
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:10,190
the Steve Allen Theater on Steve Allen,
by the way,

1364
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:14,630
son was in a cult for 11 years and I,
he was a big supporter.

1365
01:27:14,631 --> 01:27:16,130
I watched you on the Steve Allen show.

1366
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:17,870
That was one of the first
things I saw of you.

1367
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:22,640
He was a substitute hosts on CNN back in
[inaudible] 88 when the book first came

1368
01:27:22,641 --> 01:27:24,920
out and he gave me a big plug and I loved,

1369
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:29,720
I love him for it and how I get to be
at the theater named after him talking

1370
01:27:29,721 --> 01:27:31,010
about the book again.

1371
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:36,100
But the new edition and these days I'm
particularly focused on helping victims

1372
01:27:36,831 --> 01:27:40,970
of pimps and traffickers,
pimps and traffickers,

1373
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:45,800
sort of a form of a cult in
some ways is a commercial cult.

1374
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:51,320
They, they do all the bite model, the
behavior control, information, control,

1375
01:27:51,321 --> 01:27:52,760
thought, control, emotional control,

1376
01:27:52,761 --> 01:27:57,410
make people over and to a new identity
and they are dependent and obedient.

1377
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:03,070
And I've code developed a curriculum to
help survivors to you in the game to get

1378
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:07,910
to stand because that's what
pimps call what they do the game.

1379
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:13,570
So to basically understand that they
don't love the women in their stable,

1380
01:28:14,991 --> 01:28:18,260
that their products and for exploitation.

1381
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:23,270
And the only way to win the game is
to end it and get out and have a life.

1382
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:26,270
It's fascinating that you equate
those cause it makes sense.

1383
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,440
But I've never done it before.

1384
01:28:27,441 --> 01:28:31,160
I've never put it in my head and thought
of a pimp and a prostitute being like

1385
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:34,120
the pimp runs a cult. So, um,

1386
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:38,120
if you read some of the
manuals online by pimps,

1387
01:28:38,121 --> 01:28:42,590
how to brainwash the hose
there terminology for women.

1388
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:46,130
I actually tell the story in
chapter six of Rachel Thomas,

1389
01:28:46,131 --> 01:28:50,210
who was recruited while she
was in junior at Emory college.

1390
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:55,160
She's a beautiful black woman and she was
recruited by a pimp who basically said,

1391
01:28:55,161 --> 01:28:58,590
you're beautiful. You should be a
model. I want to take your picture,

1392
01:28:58,610 --> 01:29:02,490
put you in some rap music videos,
which he did.

1393
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,810
And then he started beating her up and,
and,

1394
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:10,170
and farming her out for sex and
threatening to kill her family if she told

1395
01:29:10,171 --> 01:29:14,220
anybody. Fortunately she turns
to the FBI, he's in jail,

1396
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:17,940
she's doing a project to help young girls.

1397
01:29:18,510 --> 01:29:20,940
And we've codevelop this
cause she read my book,

1398
01:29:20,941 --> 01:29:25,380
she said that this really
helps me to understand how

1399
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:27,950
he did it to me.
Have you ever seen those documentaries,

1400
01:29:27,951 --> 01:29:32,870
like pimps up hoes down or Americans?
Yes. Yeah, that's a big part of it.

1401
01:29:32,871 --> 01:29:36,140
As they would talk about how they would
find people that came from broken homes

1402
01:29:36,141 --> 01:29:40,670
or they've had daddy issues and they
would foster this feeling of family.

1403
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:43,570
Right, right. Well, and the, the, the,

1404
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:48,080
the cult that I was most experienced
with helping victims of was a cult called

1405
01:29:48,081 --> 01:29:52,340
the children of God. Uh, which
the leader was Moses, David Berg,

1406
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:56,360
and he was a pedophile and he had to
leave the u s cause he was gonna be

1407
01:29:56,361 --> 01:29:58,910
arrested.
And he in his,

1408
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:02,390
in his culty had women be
happy hookers for Jesus.

1409
01:30:02,391 --> 01:30:06,580
And he basically told people they
had to have sex with, with, uh,

1410
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:11,360
two year olds, three year olds, four
year olds. So it was a sex cult.

1411
01:30:11,361 --> 01:30:15,410
And when people would be either
kicked out of that coal or run away,

1412
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:20,200
my theory is that pimps found
them on the streets and,

1413
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:22,700
and started learning from them,

1414
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:27,020
but the religious terminology that family,
et Cetera.

1415
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:30,440
Um,
and uh,

1416
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:35,270
so the sex trafficking and then the
other thing that is occupying a lot of

1417
01:30:35,271 --> 01:30:40,040
people's consciousnesses, terrorist
cults like Isis, Boko Haram,

1418
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:44,240
which are trafficking women by the way.
Um,

1419
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:49,700
and they're taking not just
weak, uh, stupid people. But,

1420
01:30:49,701 --> 01:30:50,780
uh,
for example,

1421
01:30:50,781 --> 01:30:55,370
the one of the architects of Isis as
social media recruiting that work was the

1422
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:59,660
son of a, of a endocrinologist
at mass general hospital.

1423
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:02,210
Someone who has raised in Boston,

1424
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:04,940
went to a Catholic high school.

1425
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,980
And unfortunately or fortunately he was
killed by a drone strike few months ago,

1426
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:14,150
this kid.
But my heart goes out to them,

1427
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,830
you know,

1428
01:31:15,890 --> 01:31:20,660
people who get deceptively recruited in
mind controlled cause it happened to me

1429
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:25,610
and if I hadn't been deprogrammed I could
have done horrible acts of violence.

1430
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,840
So that's how I was trained.

1431
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:32,000
Wow. So they were training you to
sword fight, you said? Yeah, they,

1432
01:31:32,001 --> 01:31:33,410
they basically trained me

1433
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:36,030
hi or kill on command.

1434
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:41,040
And they trained me that if I allowed
a doubt when I was given an order by my

1435
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:45,930
superior that Satan was going to
be invading me, I'll exorcist.

1436
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:51,280
And so, you know, whatever
I was told to do, I dead.

1437
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:55,260
It's incredibly frightening.

1438
01:31:55,910 --> 01:32:00,460
What literally when I saw the,
the, the body's down a Jones town,

1439
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:02,710
my first thought was I
could have done that.

1440
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:07,680
And when I saw the planes going into
the World Trade Center, I thought, yeah,

1441
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:08,920
I could have done that too.

1442
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:13,720
That's part of my passion and what
propels me so many years later because the

1443
01:32:13,721 --> 01:32:15,970
problem hasn't gone away.
It's gotten worse.

1444
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:21,340
Have documentaries like going clear
the HBO documentary, has that helped?

1445
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:23,710
Definitely.
It's been great.

1446
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:28,980
My Gripe about his book
and the documentary is that
it didn't deal at all with

1447
01:32:30,371 --> 01:32:32,050
mind control or brainwashing.

1448
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:37,360
It didn't give anyone who was watching
the documentary or reading the book tools

1449
01:32:37,361 --> 01:32:42,361
for how to protect themselves or if
they were in a cult to self reflect and

1450
01:32:43,061 --> 01:32:44,380
analyze what was happening.

1451
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,070
He's only got enough time to just fill
an hour and a half or whatever it was,

1452
01:32:48,071 --> 01:32:52,990
two hours, but there's so
much. So my Rand's Joe,

1453
01:32:52,991 --> 01:32:57,280
when when, when Wright's book first
came out, I did a short video ramp.

1454
01:32:57,310 --> 01:33:02,310
I said saying going clear
as the definitive book on
Scientology is like saying

1455
01:33:03,491 --> 01:33:07,750
you've written a definitive book on
cars and leaving out guests combustion

1456
01:33:07,751 --> 01:33:12,610
engines. That was what I
said. So I was frustrated.

1457
01:33:12,611 --> 01:33:14,470
In other words, cause yeah, brilliant.

1458
01:33:14,471 --> 01:33:19,471
People like Paul Haggis who has incredible
how they would career saying I was

1459
01:33:19,571 --> 01:33:24,550
stupid for believing this for 30 years
and giving so much money to them and what

1460
01:33:24,551 --> 01:33:27,790
has happened. He's not stupid.
What has happened to those guys?

1461
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:31,170
They being attacked.
The,

1462
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:35,980
the group has changed dramatically
because of former leaders coming out and

1463
01:33:35,981 --> 01:33:37,510
speaking out.
The group.

1464
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:42,511
Anonymous helped a lot initially by
harmful now homeless by wearing masks and

1465
01:33:43,031 --> 01:33:44,860
saying, come on, let's protest.

1466
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:48,870
It scared them and it created
a culture where people were,

1467
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:52,570
we're more empowered to speak
out against them right now.

1468
01:33:52,571 --> 01:33:55,570
We want the tax exemption to be stripped.

1469
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,600
There's no reason we should be subsidizing
a group that's paying millions of

1470
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:02,590
dollars to harass form.
Remember,

1471
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:05,230
that was one of the most
disturbing aspects of the
movie when you find out that

1472
01:34:05,231 --> 01:34:09,790
they, how they achieve tax exempt
status by a litany of lawsuits, right?

1473
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:14,680
They propelled against the IRS and also
hiring pis to dig up dirt on the IRS

1474
01:34:14,681 --> 01:34:19,170
commissioners and hiring
powerful lobbyists and a,

1475
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:23,380
it's dirty. The whole thing is
dirty. Just seems too easy. Like,

1476
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:28,480
how can they be so easily influenced to
give these mean I have to do is read one

1477
01:34:29,891 --> 01:34:33,610
of his fucking books, right? And you go,
this guy, this guy wrote Scientology,

1478
01:34:33,611 --> 01:34:38,320
the guy real battlefield earth
like fucking Christ. Right? So,

1479
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:43,160
but the bottom line is that if,

1480
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:47,800
if there's a total list group that
has a black and white us versus them,

1481
01:34:47,801 --> 01:34:52,420
good versus evil,
simplistic ideology that says that,

1482
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:54,670
um,
you know,

1483
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:59,550
we have the vision for the world
has to be a, we have the tools.

1484
01:34:59,551 --> 01:35:02,960
So how to be the best person you can be.

1485
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:08,360
One needs to operate with some
consumer awareness and say,

1486
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:13,070
who is this person? Why did his
background, is he trustworthy,

1487
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:14,660
end whatever it is,

1488
01:35:14,661 --> 01:35:18,560
seek critics and x members
and know that if it's true,

1489
01:35:18,561 --> 01:35:23,090
it will stand up to scrutiny. And if
it isn't, you know, if it isn't true,

1490
01:35:23,091 --> 01:35:26,760
why would you want to invest your
time and your energy and your money in

1491
01:35:26,761 --> 01:35:28,070
something that's not real?

1492
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:31,670
People would just searching for meaning.
I mean that's what a lot of this is

1493
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:35,190
all us searching for,
meaning to make their life a better.

1494
01:35:35,191 --> 01:35:36,150
Well that's how the suck

1495
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:39,990
you in, right? I mean, they suck you
in with dianetics. When I was, uh,

1496
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:43,930
living in California for
the first time in 94, uh,

1497
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:46,660
there was no internet or I hadn't
been on you and it was just,

1498
01:35:46,661 --> 01:35:49,790
it was just starting to get on. I think
I might've gotten a computer around then.

1499
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:54,400
I, there was a late night
television commercial for
dianetics and of the volcano.

1500
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:55,243
Remember the volcano

1501
01:35:55,650 --> 01:36:00,070
of course be the OT three story is
he knew when the galactic kicked

1502
01:36:00,071 --> 01:36:00,900
dictatorship.

1503
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:03,420
Yeah. Well the, the volcano
just looked like, you know,

1504
01:36:03,421 --> 01:36:07,030
unleashing your potential to me, like,
yes. Dianetics powerful. I had, you know,

1505
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,380
listen to some Anthony Robbins books on
tape and I was ready to rock and roll.

1506
01:36:10,381 --> 01:36:11,630
You know,
I was trying to stop it

1507
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:12,730
studying.

1508
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:17,730
He was studying Ericsson and an LP
and that is basically covert hypnotic.

1509
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:21,700
Can you have a happier
marriage in 1989 page one 11.

1510
01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:26,590
How can you have more job satisfaction
in 1989? Page two 27. Yeah,

1511
01:36:26,591 --> 01:36:29,650
this was the commercial. So
I, uh, I bought the book.

1512
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:33,010
I ordered it online.
I don't even remember how I pay it.

1513
01:36:33,011 --> 01:36:34,810
I guess I had a credit card.
Um,

1514
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:39,440
and these fucking people would
not stop sending me things. Right.

1515
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:44,350
I mean, for years, like every week or
so, every month or so, whatever it was,

1516
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:48,790
I would get something in the mail
inviting me to this, inviting me to that.

1517
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:50,890
I mean,
it was just amazing how persistent

1518
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:53,550
counted as one of the 8 million followers,

1519
01:36:53,551 --> 01:36:56,700
even though there's really 20,000 or less.
I was a follower.

1520
01:36:57,390 --> 01:37:01,710
So somewhere your name.
Exactly. Am I in a database?

1521
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:05,460
Dianetics member or title?
So I'm on my end.

1522
01:37:05,461 --> 01:37:09,540
Scientology it was I at one point in
time, no. Well, how would I counted then?

1523
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:13,950
Uh, because they, cults
like to fudge statistics.

1524
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:16,470
They're much bigger than they really are.

1525
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,750
So what is the actual number
of Scientologists number
that my friends tell me?

1526
01:37:21,751 --> 01:37:26,670
It's 20,000 or less. That's not
that many in the world. That's it.

1527
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:30,690
Yeah. So how do they have so much real
estate? They have billions of dollars.

1528
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:34,890
They've sucked a lot of wealthy
people dry. That's incredible. Yeah.

1529
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,040
Paul Haggis paid a shit load of money.
Right.

1530
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,730
That's one of the things you talked about.
Yup.

1531
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:44,160
Hubbard was into money and power.
Let me empower sex.

1532
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:48,400
It's the three Universal's with
all destructive cults. Yeah.

1533
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:52,020
Like the Waco thing. Right. They always
want to have sex with everybody. His wife.

1534
01:37:52,590 --> 01:37:56,160
Um, yeah. Power money. Uh,

1535
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:00,720
interestingly I met the,
I met Byron sage last December.

1536
01:38:00,721 --> 01:38:04,650
Who is the lead FBI negotiator
with David Koresh at Waco.

1537
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:07,010
Is he the guy that sent the tanks
in to burn everybody out here?

1538
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:11,670
I'm afraid so, or somebody that
you're going to negotiate the FBI? No,

1539
01:38:11,671 --> 01:38:14,610
he was, he was clearly, um,

1540
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:19,890
unhappy and he more or less said that
we didn't know what we were doing and we

1541
01:38:19,891 --> 01:38:22,980
wish that you had, you know,
we had known what to do.

1542
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:28,270
He was clearly unhappy with the result.
He, he knew that they screwed up.

1543
01:38:28,690 --> 01:38:30,880
Well that's a nice way of saying
they murdered a bunch of people

1544
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:34,410
cause that's what they
did. The videos, well,

1545
01:38:34,411 --> 01:38:36,330
they should never have gone established.
You know,

1546
01:38:36,470 --> 01:38:39,420
they should never have gone in
with guns in the first place.

1547
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:43,080
The David Koresh was molesting
minors and they were, you know,

1548
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:48,240
making automatic weapons but the lord
him into town and arrested him and they

1549
01:38:48,661 --> 01:38:50,450
could have taken away the guns and

1550
01:38:50,770 --> 01:38:53,890
they were sure that he molested minors.
Oh yeah.

1551
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:56,860
How old were the miners?
It's hen

1552
01:38:59,910 --> 01:39:00,650
very,
Joel

1553
01:39:00,650 --> 01:39:05,450
testified before Congress. It
was one of his victims. But, um,

1554
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:07,550
I just,
I guess because of the,

1555
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:12,230
I want to come back to how I
learned about you and, and, and,

1556
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:16,400
and your good work with Stephin.
Mala knew if I may and free domain radio,

1557
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:18,330
that was,
you could say good work.

1558
01:39:18,331 --> 01:39:20,800
It's just a conversation where
I asked him some questions,

1559
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:25,890
but it helped a lot of members wake up
because they respect you and they got to

1560
01:39:28,211 --> 01:39:32,470
listen to their divine leader lie,
you know,

1561
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:37,510
and, and it was powerful
to hear him say, oh no,

1562
01:39:37,511 --> 01:39:39,080
I don't tell people the Dfo,

1563
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:43,810
I always tell people to go to therapists
before they cut off from all their

1564
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:44,800
family and friends.

1565
01:39:44,801 --> 01:39:48,940
And people knew that
that was a blatant lie.

1566
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:54,120
And it took a chink out of the mysticism
of people who were true believers

1567
01:39:55,900 --> 01:40:00,130
because you held your own with
him. You know, he didn't, you know,

1568
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:05,520
wrap you around his finger as he's used
to doing with the followers and their

1569
01:40:05,681 --> 01:40:09,190
respect for you. So I, I, my hat's off.

1570
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:12,980
It wasn't my intention.

1571
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,590
My intention was just to
have a conversation with
them and trying to figure out

1572
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:18,500
what he's doing or what
his thought process is.

1573
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,700
He's got some really good ideas about
things. It's, it's fascinating. He's,

1574
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:26,390
he's a very eloquent guy and
he's very smart, obviously,

1575
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:30,020
and he has some really
interesting concepts,

1576
01:40:30,021 --> 01:40:33,380
but he's very firm in his belief
about certain things as well,

1577
01:40:33,381 --> 01:40:36,650
to the point where you're like, one of
the things that I talked to him about,

1578
01:40:36,651 --> 01:40:40,500
we played a video of him
yelling about someone,

1579
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:44,360
if you believe in the state that you
want him killed, you want me killed,

1580
01:40:44,361 --> 01:40:48,500
and that you should get rid of all of
your friends that believe in the state,

1581
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:53,980
you know, and this idea of a narco
capitalism, her kids, and like you,

1582
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:57,440
you don't want any government whatsoever.
Like who's going to fix the streets?

1583
01:40:57,441 --> 01:41:01,030
So there was, and there was no answers
to those whose going to pay for anything,

1584
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:03,910
who's going to, who's going to
organize, where were, what do you,

1585
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:07,610
how are you going to like,
this is not like a well thought out thing.

1586
01:41:07,611 --> 01:41:09,140
This is like this someone,

1587
01:41:09,141 --> 01:41:13,480
someone said it best that he's an
incredibly eloquent man that is screaming

1588
01:41:13,481 --> 01:41:15,520
north while pretending
to be holding a camera

1589
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:19,940
bus. That's interesting. While
he's another one of those,

1590
01:41:19,941 --> 01:41:23,930
you know,
and like corporations,

1591
01:41:23,931 --> 01:41:28,310
while he's owning a corporation
type people and you know,

1592
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:32,780
saying that he's liberating people and
he's in fact enslaving people into a

1593
01:41:32,781 --> 01:41:34,930
totalistic belief system.

1594
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:36,400
Do you think that he's,

1595
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,360
do you think this is just something
that sort of happened along the way?

1596
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:44,520
Like as he was, you know, I
honestly having his philosophy and

1597
01:41:44,830 --> 01:41:46,300
I don't know enough about him,

1598
01:41:46,301 --> 01:41:51,301
I was hired by a family to consult to
help a young man who was getting sucked in

1599
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:55,420
and they were worried about that.
He would try to cut off contact.

1600
01:41:55,930 --> 01:41:57,910
And fortunately he's okay.

1601
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:01,930
So it was a relatively new phenomenon
for me but was particularly interesting

1602
01:42:01,931 --> 01:42:06,931
about this particular call was that he
was recruiting over over the Internet and

1603
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:11,670
that's how isis is largely recruiting
as well. So it was an interesting,

1604
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:14,570
well you say recruiting though.
How has he, how he recruit,

1605
01:42:14,571 --> 01:42:17,410
he just does videos where he
kind of talks about his ideas.

1606
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:19,520
Right?
Right.

1607
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,800
And he gets followers to tell other
people to watch the videos and they watch

1608
01:42:24,801 --> 01:42:28,850
for hours and hours and hours and they,
it,

1609
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:34,130
they re he rewires their thought processes
to the point where he gets them to

1610
01:42:36,111 --> 01:42:40,160
question their own belief systems,
their own value systems.

1611
01:42:40,161 --> 01:42:44,900
And because he's a bully and he's a loud
mouth and he talks so confidently about

1612
01:42:44,901 --> 01:42:48,550
a lot of things that he doesn't
really know very well. What play,

1613
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:56,740
we talked a little bit before about Robin
Williams and that has just one small

1614
01:42:56,841 --> 01:42:57,650
example.

1615
01:42:57,650 --> 01:42:59,480
Yeah. The Robin Williams
one really disturbed me.

1616
01:42:59,481 --> 01:43:02,900
It's one of the things that I questioned
him on because he said that he believed

1617
01:43:02,901 --> 01:43:04,430
that Robin Williams,
he made a video.

1618
01:43:04,431 --> 01:43:07,760
We're saying that Rob Williams killed
himself because of all the women that

1619
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:11,870
we're addicted to. Free Shit I
think is the way he described it,

1620
01:43:11,871 --> 01:43:14,870
that these women who were addicted
to getting money from him,

1621
01:43:14,871 --> 01:43:15,890
they sucked him dry.

1622
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:20,690
Robin and I had the same agent and he was
worth millions of dollars when he died.

1623
01:43:20,691 --> 01:43:23,870
He was not broken any way,
shape or form.

1624
01:43:23,871 --> 01:43:28,670
He certainly was diminishing in his
ability or is it ability to earn money was

1625
01:43:28,671 --> 01:43:32,920
diminishing as he was getting older, but
that's just normal for actors. Right.

1626
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,670
You know, he, he was,

1627
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:40,300
he had real depression and he also
had Parkinson's and the Parkinson's

1628
01:43:40,701 --> 01:43:44,810
medication that he was on, one of the
side effects was severe depression.

1629
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:49,490
Uh, also, um, there's a good friend
of mine, Dr. Mark Gordon, who had,

1630
01:43:49,580 --> 01:43:53,030
he's done a lot of work, uh, people
with traumatic brain injuries.

1631
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:58,430
He wrote a paper on, um,
uh, surgery and how, uh,

1632
01:43:58,431 --> 01:44:01,940
people who have undergone a large,

1633
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:06,970
very traumatic surgeries like bro Robin
when had open heart surgery oftentimes

1634
01:44:07,461 --> 01:44:12,461
experience postsurgery depression and
that it's a physiological response to your

1635
01:44:13,311 --> 01:44:18,311
body being under an anesthesia for long
periods of time plus the physical trauma

1636
01:44:19,641 --> 01:44:23,780
of the actual surgery itself, the injury
and you know, your body's healing.

1637
01:44:23,781 --> 01:44:25,820
And especially as you're older,

1638
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:31,090
that is a massive task to heal a heart
that has been cut open and stitched up

1639
01:44:32,511 --> 01:44:36,410
and your, your chest plate has been
spread apart. It's very traumatic,

1640
01:44:36,650 --> 01:44:37,760
physically traumatic,

1641
01:44:37,761 --> 01:44:42,761
and that oftentimes can lead to a
diminished a state of consciousness.

1642
01:44:42,981 --> 01:44:47,870
And then depression sets and also the
reality of mortality sets in on a lot of

1643
01:44:47,871 --> 01:44:48,141
people.

1644
01:44:48,141 --> 01:44:51,860
So I was upset at that because I just
didn't understand why he would do that,

1645
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:55,610
but I didn't,
I didn't have that conversation with him,

1646
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:59,540
like trying to expose him.
I had that conversation with him,

1647
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:02,540
just ask him questions and
then after it was over,

1648
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:05,150
that's when all these
videos started coming out.

1649
01:45:05,151 --> 01:45:08,870
And that's when I realized that he was
deceptive about a few things in the

1650
01:45:08,871 --> 01:45:09,704
conversation.

1651
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:10,021
Yeah.

1652
01:45:10,021 --> 01:45:15,021
It was initially fantasizing that you
would invite him back and I would be here

1653
01:45:15,451 --> 01:45:19,890
and then some families who have been cut
off from their loved one would be here

1654
01:45:19,891 --> 01:45:22,440
and we could be like, you know, dude,

1655
01:45:22,441 --> 01:45:27,441
tell all your followers to get a therapist
and reconnect with their families.

1656
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:32,190
Like if you really care,
like do something.

1657
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:32,980
Yeah.
The diff,

1658
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:37,340
the defunding thing was one of the
things that he swing his family of origin

1659
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:40,370
after hello family aboard. And He, uh,

1660
01:45:40,371 --> 01:45:45,190
apparently is fond of
telling certain people to,

1661
01:45:45,191 --> 01:45:45,570
uh,

1662
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:50,250
got rid of all of his followers. And not
just your family though, your friends,

1663
01:45:50,251 --> 01:45:53,220
your childhood friends that have
nothing to do with your family. He,

1664
01:45:53,221 --> 01:45:58,221
because he wants people not to have other
influences in their life that can say,

1665
01:46:00,001 --> 01:46:00,834
hey dude,

1666
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:02,330
do you think this is conscious?

1667
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:06,080
Do you think this is a conscious thing
or do you think this is a natural state

1668
01:46:06,081 --> 01:46:08,990
of someone trying to achieve power?
What do you mean what, what is,

1669
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:10,430
what is the mechanism behind that?

1670
01:46:11,170 --> 01:46:15,080
I, um, I don't know
about him specifically.

1671
01:46:15,081 --> 01:46:20,081
I would say most cult leaders are
not cold calculating con artists,

1672
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:22,550
they're delusional.

1673
01:46:22,850 --> 01:46:27,440
They often were victims of mind control
themselves and are kind of playing out

1674
01:46:27,441 --> 01:46:31,970
of, uh, an identification with
the aggressor type scenario.

1675
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:36,800
Uh, I don't know enough about
him to comment intelligently,

1676
01:46:36,801 --> 01:46:41,801
but for me it's about wanting people
to reclaim their personal power.

1677
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,970
And I want to say to anyone who's involved
with Molyneux who may be listening to

1678
01:46:46,971 --> 01:46:51,540
this is take, take time out, step back,

1679
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:56,460
learn about mind control, learn
about cults, talk to former leaders,

1680
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:00,900
talked to former members,
reflect over your own experience.

1681
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,970
Ask yourself what, when you were first
getting involved with mile and a,

1682
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:08,310
what did you think you were getting into
when you were first getting involved?

1683
01:47:08,311 --> 01:47:12,210
Did you believe you were
going to be cutting off from
your family, your friends,

1684
01:47:12,211 --> 01:47:15,570
your life, dropping out of school,
turning over your trust funds?

1685
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:18,030
And if the answer was
turning over your trust,

1686
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:20,370
when who's turning over your money,

1687
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:23,110
what do you mean? And what,
what, who's turning over money?

1688
01:47:23,290 --> 01:47:25,750
I can't quote a particular person,

1689
01:47:25,751 --> 01:47:29,920
but that's the pattern with
all these groups as if they
know that you have money,

1690
01:47:29,921 --> 01:47:30,720
they want it.
Yeah.

1691
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:32,580
Yeah.
But as far as I know more than you,

1692
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:35,910
he's not asking people to give them
all their money. He's not doing that.

1693
01:47:35,911 --> 01:47:37,830
He's not asking people to
turn over their trust fund.

1694
01:47:37,831 --> 01:47:39,450
He might ask for like small donations,

1695
01:47:39,451 --> 01:47:42,050
but I don't think it's fair to say
that he's asking people to turn over.

1696
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:46,840
I don't want to misspeak.
So if you are sure about that.

1697
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:49,850
Yeah, I've never heard of that.
I've never heard that accusation.

1698
01:47:49,851 --> 01:47:52,670
But what my impression from him when
I first met him was that he's very

1699
01:47:52,671 --> 01:47:56,750
intelligent and oftentimes
very intelligent people
are frustrated by really

1700
01:47:56,751 --> 01:48:00,920
stupid people that are around them.
And when he has solutions for particular,

1701
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:06,950
particular issues that are in society
or particular behavior patterns,

1702
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:10,280
he speaks about them very
confidently and people, uh,

1703
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:14,720
become enthralled with that. And then I
think that's a very addictive process.

1704
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:17,180
The addictive process
of offering solutions,

1705
01:48:17,181 --> 01:48:18,860
having people praise
you for those solutions.

1706
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:24,130
And then having people come to you for
advice and sometimes you get ahead of

1707
01:48:24,171 --> 01:48:24,770
yourself.

1708
01:48:24,770 --> 01:48:28,730
You just see this momentum in that and
sometimes you get in front of the wheel

1709
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,060
and you can't stop it and then you're
just spouting off about everything.

1710
01:48:32,061 --> 01:48:35,720
Like he would do these videos, the truth
about this or the truth about that.

1711
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:39,950
The truth about people that died and
you're talking about like people that had

1712
01:48:39,951 --> 01:48:41,180
very complex lives,

1713
01:48:41,181 --> 01:48:44,610
they lived a hundred years or whatever
the fuck they lived and the you,

1714
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:49,620
you can't just boil that down into
one video with very little research,

1715
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:53,570
especially when you're doing a hundred
of their videos a week and you're doing

1716
01:48:53,571 --> 01:48:56,390
all these interviews and doing podcasts
and doing all these things that you,

1717
01:48:56,391 --> 01:48:57,890
you're talking about someone's life,
man.

1718
01:48:57,891 --> 01:49:02,090
You can't see the truth about Lincoln
unless you fucking study Lincoln for a

1719
01:49:02,091 --> 01:49:04,490
long period of time.
And even then,

1720
01:49:04,730 --> 01:49:09,320
like Dan Carlin is my favorite historian,
doesn't even call himself in the story,

1721
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:14,240
but as, as a podcaster, he's brilliant
in his podcast, hardcore history.

1722
01:49:14,241 --> 01:49:17,630
One of the best things about it,
he will offer opposing points of view.

1723
01:49:17,810 --> 01:49:20,510
He will say, some people believe
that this is what happens. There's,

1724
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:24,590
there's some dispute about this because
it seems to be there just certain

1725
01:49:24,591 --> 01:49:28,250
schools of thought about why this took
place. I think that's super important.

1726
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:31,910
So whenever he starts saying the
truth about something like, man,

1727
01:49:31,911 --> 01:49:34,850
that you're just, you just
can't do that, you know?

1728
01:49:34,851 --> 01:49:37,440
And that's why the truth about
Robin Williams as a person,

1729
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,580
as a professional stand up comedian,
right.

1730
01:49:39,730 --> 01:49:42,800
It was particularly offensive to me
cause I'm like, come on man, you know,

1731
01:49:42,801 --> 01:49:46,550
you're talking about this beloved
guy who had this incredibly complex

1732
01:49:46,551 --> 01:49:50,650
relationship just with his ex wives,
but with show business, with life,

1733
01:49:50,651 --> 01:49:52,750
with depression,
with drugs.

1734
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:57,850
Like this is not something you can just
boil down to a one hour podcast or a one

1735
01:49:57,851 --> 01:50:01,630
hour youtube video and just
called the truth about someone.

1736
01:50:01,730 --> 01:50:05,920
Right? So I want to mention
there's a retired, uh,

1737
01:50:05,990 --> 01:50:10,400
child protective agency,
social worker named David Cooperson,

1738
01:50:10,401 --> 01:50:15,401
who wrote a book about corporal punishment
because that's one of a Mala news

1739
01:50:15,831 --> 01:50:17,690
claims, et cetera. And,

1740
01:50:18,350 --> 01:50:23,180
and cooperson has studied a number of
vol new videos and the whole ideology,

1741
01:50:23,181 --> 01:50:27,710
and he's written a great book by the way,
it's on a stop legal child.

1742
01:50:27,711 --> 01:50:32,711
abuse.com is David's website and he
just more or less says as someone who's

1743
01:50:34,041 --> 01:50:38,060
worked with children who've
been traumatized, whether
it was beaten by their,

1744
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:42,110
their parents or their foster
parents are sexually abused.

1745
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:48,110
The best thing is not to cut off
contact with the abuse of family.

1746
01:50:48,111 --> 01:50:53,111
It's to have therapists and to have
a healthy frame to work within it.

1747
01:50:54,081 --> 01:50:59,081
And not just to impose from the outside
or by some authority figure who says

1748
01:50:59,151 --> 01:51:01,130
that they know what's better for them.

1749
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:05,840
Because even kids who are being abused
still have feelings towards their mother

1750
01:51:05,841 --> 01:51:10,760
or father that are positive because
of the way we're wired. So anyway,

1751
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:14,090
I wanted to get a plugin for
his book and the fact that,

1752
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:19,520
and then I wanted to mention Molly
Kotch, Molly be Kotch k o c h. Dot.

1753
01:51:19,521 --> 01:51:24,521
Com wrote a book on parenting called
27 secrets to raising amazing children.

1754
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:25,820
And she too,

1755
01:51:25,821 --> 01:51:30,821
when I asked her to comment as an expert
on parenting about what [inaudible] was

1756
01:51:30,921 --> 01:51:32,810
saying with saying,

1757
01:51:32,811 --> 01:51:37,700
this is not going to help people
to be healthier human beings,

1758
01:51:37,701 --> 01:51:42,500
to cuddle off contact from family and
friends no matter what happened in their

1759
01:51:42,501 --> 01:51:43,101
childhood.

1760
01:51:43,101 --> 01:51:48,101
But the best thing is with therapy
and ideally with a family therapist to

1761
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:52,550
approach it to the extent that people,
uh,

1762
01:51:52,551 --> 01:51:56,660
are protected so they're not further
abused by their family of origin.

1763
01:51:56,730 --> 01:51:59,780
Well, this seems very black and white
to me because if you're coming from an,

1764
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:01,830
an incredibly abusive family and your,
your,

1765
01:52:01,831 --> 01:52:05,130
your family was brutal and they beat
you and I did horrible things to you,

1766
01:52:05,131 --> 01:52:08,850
which I know people who've come from
cutting them off is a great idea.

1767
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:13,620
I disagree. Really. So you think if your
father sexually abused you, rapes you,

1768
01:52:13,621 --> 01:52:17,730
beats you up, it comes home and an
alcoholic rage and breaks your skull,

1769
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:19,380
you should still call that guy.

1770
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:23,560
I didn't say that, but what do you
mean if that, if you're in that area.

1771
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:25,720
But if you're in that scenario,
um,

1772
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:30,840
I'm saying you should be in therapy if
that's happened to you and your therapist

1773
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:33,220
should,
should consider,

1774
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:38,670
depending on the course of treatment
approaching the f the father or the mother

1775
01:52:38,890 --> 01:52:40,660
and getting them into therapy,

1776
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:45,900
maybe they need to get off of alcohol or
drugs or maybe they they need therapy.

1777
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:52,600
But just cutting off your
entire background and past
as a chop it off for me is

1778
01:52:54,981 --> 01:52:57,500
really not a healthy long term solution.

1779
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,840
But not even saying cutting
off your entire past.

1780
01:53:00,841 --> 01:53:04,840
I'm saying don't have contact with someone
who was horrible to you. You don't.

1781
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:08,180
So what,
what I'm trying to say Joe,

1782
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:10,790
as a therapist and I've
seen these situations,

1783
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:15,740
I'm also involved with parental alienation
cases where there's a divorce and the

1784
01:53:15,741 --> 01:53:20,741
custodial parent brainwashers the
children against the father or the mother,

1785
01:53:20,991 --> 01:53:25,190
which is horrendous. People can
grow, keep people can change,

1786
01:53:25,191 --> 01:53:27,650
people can evolve and

1787
01:53:29,150 --> 01:53:30,500
whatever is on.

1788
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:36,250
Also there's false memory syndrome
where people were getting in with, uh,

1789
01:53:36,290 --> 01:53:41,210
not good therapists or using hypnosis
or getting into cults and being like,

1790
01:53:41,211 --> 01:53:43,850
I was believing I had
this horrible childhood.

1791
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:48,800
Just cutting off and saying I can't ever
talk with them again is not a healthy

1792
01:53:48,801 --> 01:53:50,000
choice in my opinion.

1793
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:55,750
Being being with an ethical therapist
and finding a way to who evaluate what's

1794
01:53:56,481 --> 01:54:01,010
happening with them and getting them
into treatment and then PR potentially to

1795
01:54:01,011 --> 01:54:06,011
have some type of family therapy
situation if it's not going to be helpful

1796
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:10,880
ultimately, then of course don't,
don't reach victimize yourself.

1797
01:54:10,881 --> 01:54:14,330
Don't allow yourself to continue
to be abused. But this kind of,

1798
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:19,220
this notion of lopping off your
father, your mother, your sister,

1799
01:54:19,221 --> 01:54:23,240
your brother because they were Shitty
to you 20 years ago or 40 years ago,

1800
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:25,760
I think is a mistake as a therapist.

1801
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:29,860
Do you, you think it's a mistake
across the board? I do, but what it,

1802
01:54:29,861 --> 01:54:33,060
but there are gotta be scenarios where
you shouldn't be hanging out with your

1803
01:54:33,061 --> 01:54:36,170
brother because your brother used to
rape you or your brother used to beat me.

1804
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:41,010
[inaudible] I'm not talking about
hanging out and communicating with them.

1805
01:54:41,011 --> 01:54:45,600
Why have any contact with someone who
horribly abused you were just because

1806
01:54:45,601 --> 01:54:47,430
their family would you
do that to a friend?

1807
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:52,680
So this idea that blood and DNA somehow
or another make you inexorably connected

1808
01:54:53,161 --> 01:54:55,530
to some person that was
horribly abusive to you.

1809
01:54:55,710 --> 01:54:57,560
If you had a friend that you
grew up with and your friend,

1810
01:54:57,561 --> 01:54:59,250
he's to rape you and
beat the fuck out of you.

1811
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:02,330
You supposed to still contact them
because they were your friend and they'll

1812
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:03,330
always be in your life.

1813
01:55:04,150 --> 01:55:07,890
Uh, I think a friend who raped me, uh,

1814
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:11,780
is a different category than a father.
A brother, a sister, a brother. Well,

1815
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:14,750
how's it different? Um,
cause it's bloody right.

1816
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:19,240
Yes. That seems crazy. Family seems like
ape thinking. That's like monkey thinking.

1817
01:55:19,270 --> 01:55:21,730
That doesn't even make any
sense. Well, I mean if someone,

1818
01:55:21,731 --> 01:55:24,790
if someone was horribly abusive to you
and they're an evil person and we both

1819
01:55:24,791 --> 01:55:27,780
agree that there are evil people in
the world, right? Yeah. Someone was

1820
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:32,800
evil to you 30 years ago. The question
is, are they still evil today?

1821
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:33,753
Why?
Find out

1822
01:55:34,210 --> 01:55:38,260
why not? Cause he's not enough time.
The if a hundred years, if you're lucky,

1823
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:39,810
you know,
I mean if you,

1824
01:55:39,811 --> 01:55:44,010
if you want to really try to fix someone
who raped you and beat you up most of

1825
01:55:44,011 --> 01:55:46,650
your childhood or would
you rather just move on?

1826
01:55:46,850 --> 01:55:47,151
Oh,

1827
01:55:47,151 --> 01:55:51,410
who are like raising the children of God
and they were raped by their brothers

1828
01:55:51,411 --> 01:55:56,411
and sisters and fathers and mothers and
they want to have a healthy relationship

1829
01:55:56,811 --> 01:56:01,010
with their children because they realize
that's the past that's not now and that

1830
01:56:01,011 --> 01:56:05,240
they were doing the best they could under
those circumstances because that's how

1831
01:56:05,241 --> 01:56:06,890
they were indoctrinated to be.

1832
01:56:06,940 --> 01:56:09,520
But this is a different thing
you're talking about people having,

1833
01:56:09,521 --> 01:56:12,190
you just said people having a
relationship with their own children.

1834
01:56:12,191 --> 01:56:16,240
You're not talking about people that the
people that raped them and abused them.

1835
01:56:16,241 --> 01:56:18,700
You're not talking about people having
a relationship with those people.

1836
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:24,270
So, for example, I mean, when
they were in, for example,

1837
01:56:24,271 --> 01:56:26,280
a cult,
like the children of God,

1838
01:56:26,281 --> 01:56:30,480
they weren't thinking that their father
and mother were raping them and their

1839
01:56:30,481 --> 01:56:34,370
aunt and their uncle raping it, but
they were having abusive sex, right?

1840
01:56:34,371 --> 01:56:38,550
That was not something that they were
ready for or wanted it to have and it hurt

1841
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:39,673
and et cetera.

1842
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:45,030
Now they're out and for me
to just say, look, you know,

1843
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:47,640
cut off all contact and,

1844
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:51,750
and assume there's no possibility
that they could grow. They can change,

1845
01:56:51,751 --> 01:56:56,660
they can evolve, they can apologize, they
can make it up to you. For me, that's,

1846
01:56:56,661 --> 01:57:00,380
that's not the ideal.
It's not what my,

1847
01:57:00,410 --> 01:57:02,520
my position as a healer,

1848
01:57:02,521 --> 01:57:05,690
as someone who's worked with
so many other people now,

1849
01:57:05,691 --> 01:57:10,691
and I'm not saying is if you've been
hurt by someone to just call them up and

1850
01:57:11,731 --> 01:57:14,480
then have them hurt you,
that's, I'm not saying that.

1851
01:57:14,481 --> 01:57:19,481
I'm saying use professionals as mediators
to see what's possible in terms of

1852
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:21,930
constructive,
healthy change.

1853
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:22,873
But you're,
you're,

1854
01:57:22,970 --> 01:57:27,230
you're putting this in this family context
and this is where it confuses me like

1855
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:29,510
that. You should do that
because they're your family,

1856
01:57:29,511 --> 01:57:31,520
but you shouldn't do that
if they were your friend.

1857
01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:32,300
No,
I'm not.

1858
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:37,300
I guess I'm not meaning to
sound so absolute and every
case should be evaluated

1859
01:57:37,431 --> 01:57:39,800
individually, but I, I do have,

1860
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:44,720
I guess I've had too many cases where
it was this kind of total cuddle off.

1861
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:45,560
Right.

1862
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:50,030
I see what you're saying
and maybe it's justified,

1863
01:57:50,090 --> 01:57:53,600
but maybe it's not. Maybe
the person really, you know,

1864
01:57:53,601 --> 01:57:58,601
got great therapy and they are incredibly
remorseful and they want to apologize

1865
01:57:59,331 --> 01:58:00,980
and there are a decent human being.

1866
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:05,420
You can keep carrying the
pain and the judgment and say,

1867
01:58:05,421 --> 01:58:07,190
I'll know I'll never talk with you again.

1868
01:58:07,191 --> 01:58:12,191
Or try to accept them for where they
are now and see whether or not they're

1869
01:58:12,531 --> 01:58:14,990
going to be beneficial to your ongoing.

1870
01:58:15,810 --> 01:58:19,040
It shouldn't the onus be on
the person who victimize you.

1871
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:20,390
If someone raped you and beat you,

1872
01:58:20,391 --> 01:58:23,720
shouldn't the onus be on them to come
and apologize to you or attempt to

1873
01:58:23,721 --> 01:58:24,554
apologize to you?

1874
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:28,490
I got to spray them out and bring them
to therapy and try to hash it out with

1875
01:58:28,491 --> 01:58:29,320
them.

1876
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,870
I would agree with that.
Yeah, I would agree with that.

1877
01:58:32,110 --> 01:58:35,950
I think everyone ultimately has to take
responsibility for their own lives and

1878
01:58:35,951 --> 01:58:37,330
their own actions.
I mean,

1879
01:58:37,331 --> 01:58:40,630
I felt terrible for a lot of the
things that I did in the Mooney is,

1880
01:58:40,631 --> 01:58:43,990
and I did best to reach out to
people I had recruited who I,

1881
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:49,150
whose lives I had interfered with and,
and it was a burden for many,

1882
01:58:49,151 --> 01:58:53,770
many years. As long as they continue to
be in the group and they're all out now.

1883
01:58:53,771 --> 01:58:57,130
But virtually no one
wants to talk with me.

1884
01:58:57,160 --> 01:59:00,310
I think they still harbor
really bad feelings towards me.

1885
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:04,070
Wow. That's gotta be so strange for you
to be in the position that you're in now,

1886
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:08,690
to have these people that look at
you as someone who victimize them.

1887
01:59:08,691 --> 01:59:12,020
And the very way you're trying
to shield people from today.

1888
01:59:12,130 --> 01:59:12,963
[inaudible]

1889
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:18,300
so the, that's probably flavoring
this idea that you're, you know,

1890
01:59:18,301 --> 01:59:21,780
you want people to always try to hash it
out or work it out because of your own

1891
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:26,400
personal experiences. Well, let, I think
people can grow and people can change.

1892
01:59:26,401 --> 01:59:28,200
They can or they cannot write.

1893
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:32,790
But also stagger them and advocate
for change. I am too, but I'm also,

1894
01:59:32,850 --> 01:59:35,520
I also believe there's some people that
are just beyond fucked up and there's

1895
01:59:35,521 --> 01:59:38,610
nothing you can do about them and
it's not a bad idea to cut them off.

1896
01:59:38,970 --> 01:59:42,360
I know I have their parents off and
they're very happy because of it,

1897
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:45,920
because their parents were evil and the
parents are fucked up. I mean, and there,

1898
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:48,570
every time they would be with them or
communicate with them would just be

1899
01:59:48,571 --> 01:59:51,660
incredibly damaging and they would have
to deal with it for months on end and

1900
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:54,090
the stress and the pain,
we're just not worth it.

1901
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:57,090
And ultimately they felt better to,
you know,

1902
01:59:57,091 --> 02:00:00,120
to forgive that person but
not communicate with them.

1903
02:00:00,290 --> 02:00:04,220
See, here's where we differ. Uh,

1904
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:06,860
I guess if I have more of the Jewish

1905
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:10,100
angle on forgiveness,

1906
02:00:10,101 --> 02:00:13,670
like I don't believe in forgiving people,

1907
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:19,090
don't apologize and don't
offer compensation and
don't promise never to do it

1908
02:00:19,731 --> 02:00:21,410
again and then never do it again.

1909
02:00:21,411 --> 02:00:26,411
That's kind of the Jewish formula and
only then is the person who was wrong in a

1910
02:00:26,991 --> 02:00:28,370
position to forgive.

1911
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:32,300
But I'm not of the thing of just forgive.

1912
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:36,350
But I,
I guess I,

1913
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:42,820
I think ultimately the more
sense of fullness of wholeness,

1914
02:00:43,490 --> 02:00:47,120
of knowing that we do everything
that's within our power,

1915
02:00:47,121 --> 02:00:50,670
our sphere of influence to
do, to be a good person, to,

1916
02:00:50,810 --> 02:00:54,740
to bring goodness to the
planet is the way to operate.

1917
02:00:54,830 --> 02:00:59,300
And I think that for
me, with my father, he,

1918
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:03,780
he didn't beat me, but he didn't
hug me. He didn't, you know,

1919
02:01:03,860 --> 02:01:08,450
give me a lot of praise when I was growing
up because his father never gave him

1920
02:01:08,451 --> 02:01:12,410
that. And instead of at
the, when I was in therapy,

1921
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:14,510
instead of being angry at him,

1922
02:01:14,540 --> 02:01:17,870
he neve under stepping
into his shoes as a child,

1923
02:01:17,871 --> 02:01:22,820
realizing he was doing the best
that he could. And at 30 I just,

1924
02:01:22,821 --> 02:01:23,720
when I saw him,

1925
02:01:23,721 --> 02:01:27,830
I just started hugging him and
he'd be like a board and I'd be,

1926
02:01:27,890 --> 02:01:31,280
I just say s stand there
because I need a hug.

1927
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:35,240
And by the time he was in his eighties,

1928
02:01:35,241 --> 02:01:37,300
he was actually wanting the hug and he

1929
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:39,240
50 years.
Yeah.

1930
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:44,510
Yeah. It took 50 years. It actually
said, I love you. And I'm proud of you.

1931
02:01:44,511 --> 02:01:49,400
He died at 92 but I got
to see my father evolve.

1932
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:53,330
And what is the big difference between
that and someone would beat the shit out

1933
02:01:53,331 --> 02:01:54,164
of you and raped you.

1934
02:01:54,390 --> 02:01:57,050
That's a lot of people's reality when
you're dealing with their parents. I mean,

1935
02:01:57,051 --> 02:02:00,530
your dad doesn't sound abusive. He just
sounded like he's the victim of his own.

1936
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:05,870
He wasn't abusive and I had a
relatively normal cha, you know,

1937
02:02:05,871 --> 02:02:09,410
boring in many ways cause they
didn't smoke. They didn't drink,

1938
02:02:09,411 --> 02:02:11,720
they didn't have affairs.
I lived in the same house.

1939
02:02:11,721 --> 02:02:15,350
That wasn't like moving all over the,
you know, it wasn't a child of divorce.

1940
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:20,660
But I guess I want to just come
back to everyone needs to kind of

1941
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:24,940
be in touch with their inner voice,

1942
02:02:24,941 --> 02:02:29,941
their inner intuition and instead of
holding of frozen frame in their mind of

1943
02:02:32,561 --> 02:02:36,630
what happened 30 years ago
and just keeping that, eh,

1944
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:39,520
I can't be with him because of that.

1945
02:02:40,810 --> 02:02:42,730
Find out what's going on.

1946
02:02:42,731 --> 02:02:46,540
And I'm not saying put yourself in
a position where you can be harmed,

1947
02:02:46,570 --> 02:02:51,570
but you can use third parties to find
out what's going on there and there could

1948
02:02:52,121 --> 02:02:55,270
be some really radical
positive changes that happen.

1949
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:58,300
That could be a really good thing.
I see here

1950
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:01,740
in up to a certain degree,

1951
02:03:01,890 --> 02:03:05,940
there's a certain degree of abuse that
I think some parents have enacted on

1952
02:03:05,941 --> 02:03:06,870
their children.

1953
02:03:07,230 --> 02:03:10,020
There was a story that someone told me
recently about this brother that was

1954
02:03:10,021 --> 02:03:12,440
raping his sister and the,
you know,

1955
02:03:12,450 --> 02:03:16,590
this went on for years and then the dad
found out about it and the dad joined in

1956
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:18,390
and this went on for more years.

1957
02:03:20,020 --> 02:03:22,480
Those people can both go fuck themselves.

1958
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:25,530
If I was that girl and if I knew
that girl, I would tell them to,

1959
02:03:25,570 --> 02:03:29,110
I would tell him never, never
contact them, never talked
to them. There's no need.

1960
02:03:29,111 --> 02:03:31,810
You don't. Just because they're your
blood, that doesn't mean anything.

1961
02:03:31,870 --> 02:03:34,000
It's nonsense. Your family, you know,

1962
02:03:34,001 --> 02:03:36,280
you can have family
that's not related to you.

1963
02:03:36,281 --> 02:03:39,640
The people that you love and trust and
if you treat them like they are family,

1964
02:03:39,641 --> 02:03:40,990
they'll treat you like family too.

1965
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:45,820
I think you choose the people that you
can be in contact with and that's the

1966
02:03:45,821 --> 02:03:49,600
problem that a lot of people have with
this whole idea of family is that you're

1967
02:03:49,601 --> 02:03:52,110
born into them. You don't, it's like just,

1968
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:55,720
you just get a random hand
of cards, right? You know,

1969
02:03:55,721 --> 02:03:58,300
and that's your family and you just
have to accept that for the rest of your

1970
02:03:58,301 --> 02:03:59,770
life.
And then when they fuck up,

1971
02:03:59,771 --> 02:04:03,250
you have to keep trying to forgive them
or help them or bring them together or

1972
02:04:03,251 --> 02:04:04,030
not.

1973
02:04:04,030 --> 02:04:08,920
I say not say with certain people like
that girl whose brother and dad raped

1974
02:04:08,921 --> 02:04:12,460
her. This no fucking need to
bring those people into your life.

1975
02:04:12,461 --> 02:04:16,300
If you can get away from them, stay away
from them. Hopefully they're in jail. Now.

1976
02:04:16,301 --> 02:04:18,820
I don't know what happened
in that particular situation,

1977
02:04:18,821 --> 02:04:23,020
but I grew up with a father that beat
the fuck out of my mother and I saw it a

1978
02:04:23,021 --> 02:04:27,820
bunch of times when I was little and
I was five years old.

1979
02:04:27,821 --> 02:04:28,654
And my mom laughed.

1980
02:04:29,230 --> 02:04:32,860
So these images are very old
and they're very distorted,

1981
02:04:32,861 --> 02:04:37,300
but there are 100% real. There's, there's
certain things that were undeniable,

1982
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:42,390
the physical abuse, and I have had no
desire to talk to that person ever since,

1983
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:45,620
and I don't ever want to,
I don't need it. You know,

1984
02:04:45,630 --> 02:04:47,580
this idea of blood that this,

1985
02:04:47,581 --> 02:04:51,510
because this person had sex with my mom
and made me that I have to forgive this

1986
02:04:51,511 --> 02:04:54,750
dummy and spend time with them and try
to work out why beat the fuck out of my

1987
02:04:54,751 --> 02:04:58,300
mom in front of me. I don't need
that. And I don't think that,

1988
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:01,500
I don't think you need that to heal
and grow. I don't think it's necessary

1989
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:05,150
and I'm not imposing my
point of view on you.

1990
02:05:05,151 --> 02:05:10,151
I'm just sharing my point of view as a
therapist who's seen literally hundreds

1991
02:05:10,970 --> 02:05:15,710
and hundreds of different
cases and people can change.

1992
02:05:15,770 --> 02:05:17,060
I also want to go,

1993
02:05:17,061 --> 02:05:21,920
come back to the false memory point
because there's a lot of people who went

1994
02:05:21,921 --> 02:05:26,560
into therapy or they got into a cult and
they came to have the belief that are

1995
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:31,520
in a satanic cult. They were beaten
and tortured by, by their family.

1996
02:05:31,550 --> 02:05:35,360
And it's not true,
but there's still acting as if it is.

1997
02:05:35,390 --> 02:05:40,250
And there's no effort to reality test
to actually talk to the siblings or talk

1998
02:05:40,251 --> 02:05:42,620
with the neighbors or see if there's a,

1999
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:46,910
most sexual predators
have multiple victims.

2000
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:50,960
They're usually not just enacting
on one particular person.

2001
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:56,300
Um, and what I've been saying
from the beginning is, you know,

2002
02:05:56,360 --> 02:06:00,770
find a good therapist who's experienced
with trauma and sexual abuse and such,

2003
02:06:00,830 --> 02:06:01,550
and,

2004
02:06:01,550 --> 02:06:06,320
and do it to your process and consider,

2005
02:06:07,130 --> 02:06:11,210
and especially if there's anyone listening
who's a follower of Stefan Molyneux

2006
02:06:11,211 --> 02:06:14,770
who's cut off contact with their brothers
and their sisters and their mothers.

2007
02:06:15,740 --> 02:06:19,760
Is this an epidemic?
I think there are a hundreds really.

2008
02:06:19,820 --> 02:06:24,220
I think there were hundreds and I'm just
saying, take a timeout from Molyneux.

2009
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:27,650
Stop listening to his
podcasts for a few weeks.

2010
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:33,650
Learn about mind control. Learn
about cults. Read the book. I, I,

2011
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:38,750
I watched a video that was put on line
by a follower of Molyneux who was,

2012
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:43,830
you know, had just left and I, I
reached out to him. I said, I've,

2013
02:06:43,950 --> 02:06:47,930
I've got free videos on my freedom
of mind website. Check out my book.

2014
02:06:47,931 --> 02:06:52,850
And he just emailed me literally yesterday
was this morning saying, you know,

2015
02:06:52,851 --> 02:06:57,740
it's given me a new understanding
about everything. Thank you so much.

2016
02:06:58,340 --> 02:06:59,173
And,

2017
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:03,590
and if you have cut off contact
for years and years and years,

2018
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:08,480
find someone to reach out to your
family and create a way pack.

2019
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:13,900
Because a lot of people are afraid to
even reach out and they're confused still

2020
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:17,000
because they're like Israel.
Yeah.

2021
02:07:17,810 --> 02:07:21,020
I've had some people who've
left Scientology, for example,

2022
02:07:21,021 --> 02:07:26,021
come to me because they many years of
being in the call didn't go to mom when

2023
02:07:27,441 --> 02:07:29,060
she was dying in the hospital.

2024
02:07:29,090 --> 02:07:32,660
They didn't go to their brother's wedding
and they were supposed to be the best

2025
02:07:32,661 --> 02:07:36,910
man. What? They borrowed money over and
over and over again. The families like,

2026
02:07:36,911 --> 02:07:40,600
screw you, we never want to hear from
you again. Now that person's woken up,

2027
02:07:40,601 --> 02:07:45,070
they've left Scientology and nobody in
the family wants anything to do with them.

2028
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:49,870
And I feel like I at least should make
an effort to say to them, you know,

2029
02:07:50,290 --> 02:07:54,160
there is such a thing as mine control and
they were doing what they thought they

2030
02:07:54,161 --> 02:07:55,210
were supposed to do.

2031
02:07:55,330 --> 02:08:00,330
I being in the cult and you know
you were right to be angry at them,

2032
02:08:00,701 --> 02:08:04,030
for not being there for mom and
for not being there. However,

2033
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:06,010
that doesn't mean that they're bad,

2034
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:10,540
bad people and that there isn't
some value and reconnecting. Again,

2035
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:14,160
it was one of the more disturbing parts
of going clear was seeing the people

2036
02:08:14,161 --> 02:08:17,580
that were just emotionally devastated by
the fact their family wouldn't talk to

2037
02:08:17,581 --> 02:08:20,010
them anymore because they
had been excommunicated.

2038
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:24,910
Right. So this disconnection, the
JW is call it this fellow shipping.

2039
02:08:24,911 --> 02:08:29,320
It's a common mind control
technique to manipulate people,

2040
02:08:29,321 --> 02:08:31,330
to cut them off from family and friends.

2041
02:08:31,331 --> 02:08:36,160
If people are breaking no rules
or questioning the authority,

2042
02:08:36,161 --> 02:08:36,994
et Cetera,

2043
02:08:37,390 --> 02:08:41,800
it's not something that should be
done by any legitimate religion.

2044
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:43,330
Certainly not any,

2045
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:48,390
any legitimate organization telling
people you can't talk to your sister,

2046
02:08:48,461 --> 02:08:51,340
your brother, your mother,
your father, because some,

2047
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:54,610
some authority figure
says God doesn't want it,

2048
02:08:54,700 --> 02:08:57,220
or that you've violated the rules.

2049
02:08:57,640 --> 02:08:57,710
Well,

2050
02:08:57,710 --> 02:09:01,020
either they're taking it to another level
right there saying you can't talk to

2051
02:09:01,021 --> 02:09:03,390
them because it's against
the rules to talk to them.

2052
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:06,570
They're not encouraging the fooling,
you know,

2053
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:10,980
getting rid of your family
of original origin. They're
there. They're encouraging.

2054
02:09:11,130 --> 02:09:15,960
They're saying there's no rule. There's
a rule. I mean, it's not encouraging.

2055
02:09:15,990 --> 02:09:19,020
They're there. They're actually
saying like, you can't talk to them.

2056
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:21,230
Right?
And if you do talk with them,

2057
02:09:21,231 --> 02:09:25,430
then you risk being kicked
out of the group too. Right?

2058
02:09:25,460 --> 02:09:29,390
That's the threat. Now, one of the
things about mind control cults is,

2059
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:33,110
um,
like I was shown the exorcist,

2060
02:09:33,111 --> 02:09:36,440
if I was going to leave the
moonies part of my unconscious,

2061
02:09:36,441 --> 02:09:41,300
saw that little girl with the et cetera
in the mind of someone on the mind

2062
02:09:41,301 --> 02:09:41,691
control,

2063
02:09:41,691 --> 02:09:46,040
they can't visualize themselves out of
the group being happy and fulfilled.

2064
02:09:47,650 --> 02:09:52,640
And, and in the mind of Scientologists,
if you leave, you're going to go insane.

2065
02:09:53,150 --> 02:09:54,530
You're going to commit suicide,

2066
02:09:54,531 --> 02:09:58,270
you're going to become a
drug addict is no possible.

2067
02:09:58,340 --> 02:10:02,810
And they put phobia's a member's minds
against any mental health professional.

2068
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:07,400
So if you're feeling suicidal,
if you are having major Migraines,

2069
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:11,750
only do auditing only do
Scientology techniques.

2070
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:16,310
And at the point that I think it
was Paul Haggis that you know,

2071
02:10:16,311 --> 02:10:21,110
we refuse to, you know,
refute his gay daughter when,

2072
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:26,140
when he learned that Scientology came
out against the bill in California at

2073
02:10:28,251 --> 02:10:28,450
that,

2074
02:10:28,450 --> 02:10:33,450
that was his wake up call because his
love for his daughter trumped the cult

2075
02:10:33,801 --> 02:10:34,634
ideology.

2076
02:10:34,930 --> 02:10:36,030
How bizarre is that?

2077
02:10:36,031 --> 02:10:40,900
That Scientology has an
anti homosexual ideas?

2078
02:10:41,610 --> 02:10:46,380
I think it's very bizarre, but a
lot of cults are very anti, but why?

2079
02:10:46,410 --> 02:10:51,330
What is, what does Hubbard
was a homophobe, is that what
it is? Yeah. Yeah. Probably.

2080
02:10:51,331 --> 02:10:54,810
He had sexual drives towards
men that he couldn't deal with,

2081
02:10:54,811 --> 02:10:59,010
so he decided to make a rule and
make it into a horrible thing.

2082
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:03,090
So how does it fit with a guy like
John Travolta who's allegedly gay?

2083
02:11:04,470 --> 02:11:05,700
That seems so bizarre.

2084
02:11:07,060 --> 02:11:07,480
It's,

2085
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:12,480
it's incredibly horrible because
essentially you can't eat it.

2086
02:11:12,850 --> 02:11:13,570
The cult.

2087
02:11:13,570 --> 02:11:18,570
The cult identity does not
want to acknowledge the
person's true self and every

2088
02:11:18,821 --> 02:11:22,780
time he acts out his true nature,
he feels bad.

2089
02:11:23,710 --> 02:11:26,470
But the speculation is that
they have some dirt on him.

2090
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:30,130
The speculation is that through the
auditing process or the files they keep on

2091
02:11:30,131 --> 02:11:33,940
you, that was what they implied in the
documentary that they have these stacks of

2092
02:11:33,941 --> 02:11:34,680
files on

2093
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:37,530
and they do massages, folders, et cetera.

2094
02:11:37,540 --> 02:11:41,610
They send that in the Time
magazine cover story in 1990. Uh,

2095
02:11:41,611 --> 02:11:46,611
there's a huge amount of fear and threat
that if you leave the group or speak

2096
02:11:46,711 --> 02:11:49,950
out against the group, they're going
to come after you and ruin your life.

2097
02:11:50,430 --> 02:11:55,430
And unfortunately a lot of people have
fear and for me and other people who've

2098
02:11:56,821 --> 02:12:01,500
left, you kind of have to rise
above it and say, screw you,

2099
02:12:02,310 --> 02:12:05,430
I'm not going to live like that.
We're scrolling towel,

2100
02:12:05,431 --> 02:12:07,920
whatever you want to tell that screw you.

2101
02:12:08,070 --> 02:12:12,120
For certain people though that
the ideology of Scientology,
the, the, the, the,

2102
02:12:12,180 --> 02:12:13,710
the tenants or the,
you know,

2103
02:12:13,711 --> 02:12:18,210
the principals seem to help them give
them some sort of structure. I mean,

2104
02:12:18,211 --> 02:12:22,140
is there any way that there's anything
beneficial to like the way they,

2105
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:25,590
I mean there's a lot of successful people
that are Scientologists and they seem

2106
02:12:25,591 --> 02:12:30,000
like ambitious and motivated.
It seems like there's part of it,

2107
02:12:30,001 --> 02:12:32,010
and I'm not trying to support Scientology,

2108
02:12:32,130 --> 02:12:34,710
but I'm trying to look at this
in a balanced perspective.

2109
02:12:34,890 --> 02:12:39,150
It seems like at least some of what
they're doing is trying to enhance your

2110
02:12:39,151 --> 02:12:41,910
ability to function as a
person, right? Is that not true?

2111
02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:47,640
Uh, they say one thing and
what they do as another thing,

2112
02:12:47,670 --> 02:12:52,560
they say that they're going to give you
power over your mind and your body over

2113
02:12:52,561 --> 02:12:54,630
matter and are joining a clean space.

2114
02:12:54,660 --> 02:12:59,660
But a lot of it comes down to the belief
that's programmed into the Scientology

2115
02:13:00,511 --> 02:13:01,470
identity.

2116
02:13:01,710 --> 02:13:06,210
That you have this higher truth that
you understand the nature of reality,

2117
02:13:06,690 --> 02:13:09,210
that a certain technique is going to work.

2118
02:13:09,510 --> 02:13:12,060
But what we know from the placebo effect,

2119
02:13:12,090 --> 02:13:16,590
the power of authority and the power
of suggestion is what's happening here.

2120
02:13:16,591 --> 02:13:19,950
It's not the techniques itself,
it's not the ideology.

2121
02:13:20,110 --> 02:13:21,040
And also the,
the,

2122
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:24,820
the feeling of being empowered by
being a part of a successful group,

2123
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:28,120
a successful group,
and the motivation that they give you.

2124
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:31,100
You got a buggy. Yeah, it's pretty late.

2125
02:13:31,130 --> 02:13:35,130
[inaudible] five 30 and this half an hour
ago. Your bladder's talking. Go ahead.

2126
02:13:35,131 --> 02:13:37,140
And then there's a bathroom right over
