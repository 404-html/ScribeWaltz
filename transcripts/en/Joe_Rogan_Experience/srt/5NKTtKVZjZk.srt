1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
They got this all done.
Boom.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,560
Live.
Okay.

3
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:07,740
What the fuck will you just tell me?
Hi Matt Farah,

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,030
what's funny?
You can see again,

5
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:10,850
we're just talking about Rolls Royce.
Yeah,

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,710
because I was hearing your in your new 
baller studio,

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,050
which congratulations.
Thank you.

8
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:20,051
Sick admiring your skylights.
And we were discussing the Rolls Royce 

9
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:21,810
and uh,
the starfield ceiling they do,

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,650
which is they put all these fiber optic 
lights into your headliner and it looks 

11
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:32,290
like the stars and it's,
I think it's 15 grand option,

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,940
but I bad ass.
So bad.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,240
So bad ass.
And not only will they do it so you can 

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,900
get your standard star pattern,
which is just whatever the guy,

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,050
just random random lights or they'll 
make you exact constellations if you 

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,371
prefer writing,
like if you were one of those astrology 

17
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:52,371
pdf or they will make you,
you know,

18
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:55,170
the sky directly above your house if you
give them a coordinate,

19
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:58,500
there's a photo of a bad ass bad ass.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,170
It's like so awesome.
You are,

21
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,380
you're balling so hard.
You were driving around with a car with 

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:07,380
stars in the roof.
Well,

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,231
so the last thing I said before you hit 
live was that they have just announced 

24
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:16,770
they have come out with a shooting star,
so I don't know how it works.

25
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:19,730
I'm not sure exactly what,
but I guess you could do.

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,260
You can get shooting stars and you're 
crazy.

27
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:27,261
What are they going to do to make the 
whole thing a big lcd pattern or 

28
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:27,261
something?
Yeah,

29
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:27,510
I guess or I dunno.
I guess you can.

30
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,650
You could have run on an led or a fiber 
optic line that,

31
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,240
that works in a kind of a train.
I,

32
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:39,241
I emailed once I got that press release 
because I get press releases and I just 

33
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:39,241
delete them.
I don't,

34
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,830
you know,
but when I saw a shooting star ceiling,

35
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:45,831
I responded kind of further info in 
video on this and they said they'd get 

36
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:45,831
back to me.

37
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,670
So I've never even been in one of those 
things.

38
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,710
Never.
No,

39
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,720
no.
You must,

40
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,350
you must.
What is it like in there?

41
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,030
It's like sailing yachting.
Phil Hartman had a really,

42
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,940
really old,
I think it was an old Bentley.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,300
I mean like really like sixties old,
old,

44
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,940
older than that,
like 30 years old.

45
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,990
It was fucking old man.
I wish I paid attention to cars back 

46
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,730
then,
but back then it was when I just started

47
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,140
getting on TV.
I really didn't.

48
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,490
I,
you know,

49
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:15,750
when,
when I was broke,

50
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,970
I always loved cars when I was a kid.
But then I was broke.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,580
My attitude was like,
don't think about some shit you're never

52
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,560
going to be able to afford,
so just don't think.

53
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:26,280
Look at you now.
Joe Rogan with all the toys somewhere to

54
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:31,281
park them somewhere to park them.
But he had this old ball looking thing.

55
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:36,411
It was like,
it was like something out of a citizen 

56
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:36,411
Kane.
Oh yeah.

57
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:40,290
Just this incredible boat and you know,
like pontoon fenders,

58
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,310
the whole deal.
Thank you.

59
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:46,311
Shifted it on the tree.
Probably I would say if I had to guess 

60
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:46,590
something ball or that Phil,
like I would say Bentley,

61
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,830
continental [inaudible] would be the 
most likely.

62
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,920
It might've been a candidate that's a 
stunning automobile,

63
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,980
but he loved that thing.
He would just have this giant smile on 

64
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,730
his face with that thing.
It was,

65
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,130
oh,
he loves cars.

66
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,930
That's great.
Phil Hartman's bit like that.

67
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,650
I wish I could remember because like I 
said back then like if you asked me to 

68
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,080
do like there's cars that I don't know 
shit about like rolls royces or Bentley,

69
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,900
but if you show me like an old porsche,
I'd be like,

70
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,460
oh,
that's a 73 long nose.

71
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,060
I know that we all have our areas of 
nerdom,

72
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,390
like muscle cars.
I can.

73
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,330
I'm a good muscle car guy.
Understand most muscle cars.

74
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,670
Like you could pick them out in the 
lineup,

75
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,180
but.
Well,

76
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,250
Bentley and Rolls Royce were,
are a weird one because they have sort 

77
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,101
of this intertwined history where they 
were separated and then they became 

78
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:35,101
together and then they became separate 
again.

79
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:40,051
So there's a lot of rolls.
Royce's and Bentley's that are mostly 

80
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:41,200
the same car.
Those are,

81
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,590
that's like super baller level.
Were you like,

82
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,520
okay look,
forget about it.

83
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,600
Let's just get a car that's makes no 
sound like you can't say anything.

84
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:52,990
Hoses are really amazing cause they're 
so fucking cool.

85
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:53,900
Dude,
I can imagine,

86
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,490
and even like to uh,
a lot of car guys,

87
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:58,450
especially like,
you know,

88
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,970
you are such like a manual transmission,
you know,

89
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:02,290
you want your car,
I know you,

90
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,330
you want your car to be like really 
close to a race car.

91
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,090
I can be in dirty,
gritty,

92
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:11,020
like I wanna I wanna feel the rocks as 
our drive over them for you would,

93
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:16,050
you would appreciate a Rolls Royce is 
ability to make a hundred percent of 

94
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,910
that disappear.
You know what I'm saying?

95
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,120
Like disappeared entirely.
And like there's really neat details.

96
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,210
Like you are the word flying or floating
or sailing is so true because you don't 

97
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:34,261
really drive it.
You just kind of fucking will it down 

98
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:34,261
the road.

99
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:38,430
And you know how like you're,
you're a porsche or a sports car will 

100
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,070
have like the thumb grips on the wheel 
at night and three.

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,960
So Rolls Royce has thumb grips at four 
and eight.

102
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,120
Really?
You drive them?

103
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:50,550
Underhand gangster.
Extremely gangster under.

104
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,810
See,
let me try that.

105
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,380
Let me feel this.
It's that you.

106
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,430
Yeah,
it's underhand.

107
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,490
Yeah.
Because you don't even lift your arms 

108
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,500
above shoulder height and then you know 
your car has a tech commoner,

109
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,100
right?
It shows you your Rpms.

110
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:08,680
Is there a rough indicator of how much 
power you're using?

111
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:09,640
Right?
Roughly?

112
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:14,641
Not exactly,
but before people go crazy about the 

113
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:14,641
lack of a technical term,
rolls royces,

114
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:19,021
don't have tech amateurs.
They have a power reserve gauge which 

115
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:24,091
shows you how much power the car has,
but that you are not using at any given 

116
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:27,060
time.
Whoa.

117
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,690
Right.
So if you're,

118
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:33,340
if you're coasting along,
it's at 100 going down a hill.

119
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,230
Maybe you're just off the gas off the 
brake,

120
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:36,990
coasting.
There you go.

121
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,120
Power Reserve.
So if you're coasting,

122
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,420
you're using zero percent of your engine
and the idea is to keep that gauge low 

123
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,150
because you want to be able to pass cars
and cruise down the road while using 25 

124
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:56,460
percent of this car's engine.
So.

125
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,020
And they're stupid horsepower,
right?

126
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:01,410
Like crazy bomber,
right?

127
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,880
Like not like crazy crazy.
But like for four to 500.

128
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:05,270
So.
Hi.

129
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:05,860
Yes.
Hi.

130
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,700
Hi.
Hi.

131
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:12,150
Yet,
isn't that funny that saying that it's 

132
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,240
not that hard for car of today,
our standards are so crazy blown out.

133
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:17,000
Our standards or the Internet has fucked
us all up.

134
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,270
You gotta understand.
I was reading about a new Miata,

135
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,480
which by the way might be like one of 
the most underrated cars ever.

136
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,930
The new MIATA.
Lovely.

137
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,770
Lovely.
Yeah,

138
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,800
they're great.
Like for the bang for the buck,

139
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,450
for a fun little car to drive that Kinda
has real nimble.

140
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,540
That's around their fucking great.
But it was only like a hundred and 50 

141
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,990
horsepower that's there it is.
That's the new Miata.

142
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,960
One hundred and 60 horsepower.
I think that's like,

143
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:43,220
you hear that and you're like,
what?

144
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,340
Yeah.
But you know there's a company in 

145
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:48,340
Colorado called Flying Miata,
you know them,

146
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:48,760
right?
You know where I'm going with this.

147
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,650
Yeah.
They put an ls three in one of these.

148
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,160
So I drove on that has a 575 horsepower 
ls three and it's fucking great.

149
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,700
That must be insane.
It's great.

150
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:01,160
You know why?
Because it's got these long legs,

151
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,870
you know,
like it's a little car,

152
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,120
but it's got the corvette long legs.
So your third gear's good for like 90.

153
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,100
Wow.
That's great.

154
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,500
Now when you're driving a car like that,
is the balance fucked up by then?

155
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,730
No,
it's actually similar weight it,

156
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,020
it's,
I think,

157
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,380
I think the ls conversion,
it's like a,

158
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,840
I don't want to say exactly,
but it's like maybe that's the older 

159
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:28,840
car,
Jamie,

160
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,600
that they do it to a newer one as well.

161
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,000
It's like a few extra pounds in the 
front,

162
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:35,090
but actually they have to use the rear 
differential from a Camaro.

163
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:40,091
So a lot of the extra weight goes in the
back and so the cars maybe a hundred 

164
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,880
pounds heavier with the v eight in it,
but,

165
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,130
but it's four times the weight of a 
Miata,

166
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,330
like 2150.
That so like.

167
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,150
And then you see that that thing in the 
picture was called an extra set which is

168
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,480
so that,
that exoskeleton thing that says flying 

169
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,331
me out on it.
Oh this is an interesting photograph 

170
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:01,331
actually.
Sorry,

171
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:05,080
podcast people.
We've got to two vehicles on a track 

172
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,291
from flying me out of the one in front 
is a an exoskeleton car with really no 

173
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,480
body work on it at all and that's called
an excess set and so what is,

174
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:16,481
you buy that chassis and you buy a Miata
and you take apart the Miata and you put

175
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,510
all the Miata shit on this chassis and 
so you end up with a 1200 pounds things 

176
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,270
and you can put turbos and you can put 
vh and you can do all different kinds of

177
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:26,480
stuff.

178
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,950
Is it street legal?
Yes,

179
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,960
it is street legal,
car legal.

180
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,580
And then the thing is called a bower cat
fish.

181
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,830
Did you say carb legal like as far as 
like a missions?

182
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,300
Yeah,
yeah,

183
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,950
yeah.
I mean if you use a car legal,

184
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:41,620
like the Iraq engine,
like,

185
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,020
like John Ward likes or the stock Miata 
engine for sure.

186
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:47,090
Yeah.
If you use a carb legal engine,

187
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:48,440
it's a carb.
It's California legal.

188
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,650
That's crazy.
I've driven them there fast,

189
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:56,651
but you know,
not nothing about excess sets design 

190
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,990
should be taken from this statement.
I don't feel safe in them.

191
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,730
You know what I'm saying?
I'm not trying to insult or the open.

192
00:09:03,731 --> 00:09:04,740
Yeah,
it's just,

193
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:07,800
it's to me,
I like having a body around me,

194
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,160
but it's way safer than a motorcycle.
True.

195
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,470
But a motorcycle.
I was thinking about this.

196
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,740
A motorcycle offers an experience that 
cannot be replicated and if you are 

197
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,550
going to take the kind of risks involved
in riding a motorcycle,

198
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,280
that experience is kind of worth it in 
to,

199
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,030
to me in short bursts.

200
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:35,030
Whereas I don't think the experience of 
driving a car with no body on it is 

201
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:37,650
worth you.
I don't think teachers either,

202
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:40,410
but fuck.
Because you can get a lot of awesome car

203
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,130
with bodywork.
Yeah.

204
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,300
But it's also like the thrill of the 
motorcycles,

205
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,910
like it is either you either have it or 
you don't,

206
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,750
like you're either in a convertible or 
you're on a motorcycle and the,

207
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,880
and the leaning of courses is really.
And is that thing any more thrilling 

208
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,280
than a regular convertible?
Honestly,

209
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,570
I mean it's faster.
Um,

210
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,360
it's not faster than all convertibles,
but having the no,

211
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,300
uh,
you know,

212
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,780
the no roof.
I mean,

213
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,800
you just feel connected to the elements.
It's crazy and you can go because it's 

214
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,920
so light,
you know,

215
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:14,910
you can use an a relatively mundane 
engine and go very,

216
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,820
very fast.
Yeah.

217
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,580
Imagine 1200 pounds.
Yeah.

218
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:18,090
It's nothing.

219
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,080
It's nothing.
You know,

220
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,890
and you put up.
Imagine,

221
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,500
imagine a corvette engine in that thing,
which you can do.

222
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,750
You know?
I mean,

223
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,760
yeah,
people are crazy.

224
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:29,130
I dropped some shit.
That is dangerous.

225
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,220
I know you're one take video series that
you do where you're kind of people let 

226
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,990
you drive their fucking crazy hot rods.
No souped up cars.

227
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:37,770
Like,
Wooh.

228
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,850
I've just retired from driving people's 
personal cars.

229
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:41,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

230
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,170
Good for you.
I just saw this.

231
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I might go to reno and Brenda says this,
this is these weird software guys built 

232
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,620
this thing in Reno that's called a test 
Salon de.

233
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,380
That's a.
Did you hear anything?

234
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:52,920
No,
you didn't.

235
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,980
It's electric.
That is a tesla drive train in a 1981 

236
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,661
Honda and it weighs,
it weighs 200 pounds and it,

237
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,240
it runs like an eight second quarter 
mile a hilarious.

238
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,700
Right.
He just loved that.

239
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,350
This people like that out there,
the nerds are winning.

240
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,260
They're winning 100 percent.
Yeah.

241
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:15,450
The tests Londa Yup.
So I'd,

242
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,080
I'd,
you know,

243
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,840
weird shit,
but um,

244
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,260
I,
I figured out I have rolled the dice,

245
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,240
you know,
you gotta know when to walk away,

246
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:23,040
know when to run.
Nowhere to count your money.

247
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,510
Yeah.
I think the dealing's done,

248
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,740
I'm sure.
Yeah.

249
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:30,741
Good for you.
You made out one of the rare few that 

250
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:30,741
beat Vegas.
I mean,

251
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:32,820
either I decide when to stop or a lawyer
does.

252
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,670
You know,
that's so true.

253
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,810
Um,
I just,

254
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,690
what we were talking about,
it's just so amazing that the horsepower

255
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:42,750
wars it because of their steady increase
every year,

256
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:45,330
you know,
you come out with a 2018 corvette,

257
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,820
people expect it to be faster.
It's always got to go,

258
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,310
hey,
we got the same thing.

259
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,740
Hey fucking it just put a new engine and
the Mustang 3:50

260
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:54,250
gt.

261
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,170
And so there's always something,
hey,

262
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:57,670
they got the gt 500 coming.
Well,

263
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:59,860
shit,
I'm going to go up to 900 horsepower.

264
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,460
Like isn't it crazy that it's just my 
money,

265
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,550
like not even a lot of money.
Like you can get a hell cat for used 

266
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,790
hellcat,
like 45 grand,

267
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,310
you know what I mean?
Like 600 bucks a month,

268
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:15,550
700 bucks a month and you got 700 
horsepower.

269
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,950
You hooked me up with one of those when 
I was in Denver when I was fingering the

270
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,250
central red hellcat mountains.
I remember that with the astronauts 

271
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,050
outfit on fast.
Right.

272
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,960
Great.
It's a great car.

273
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,870
Now they have a wider.
Have you seen the wider bodywork?

274
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,930
I like that.
It's actually got quite a lot more tire 

275
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:36,930
under.
That was good.

276
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,800
I had a complaint.
It doesn't have that muscle car ass.

277
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,350
I like a car with the wide body.

278
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,320
Hellcat does.
Yeah.

279
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,360
There's something about those fat tires 
in the rear is an old school muscle had 

280
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,550
dork.
That's what you want.

281
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,220
I saw a motivator.
Matt de Andrea?

282
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,110
No,
he was on Adam Carolla's.

283
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:58,111
Podcast card does car guys.
He just posted a picture on twitter of 

284
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,290
Esau.
Your old sick fish spotted somewhere.

285
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,420
That's funny.
It was not in a.

286
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,700
It was not in the,
it was in a bit of a sad state,

287
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,390
honestly.
It wasn't really just,

288
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,110
it was a little tired and beat up one of
the picture.

289
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:10,030
Yeah.
Someone and that's unfortunate.

290
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Yeah.
It was a cool looking car when that 

291
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,080
thing came out.
Yeah.

292
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,080
That football player,
Reggie,

293
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,900
what's his name was Reggie Bush.
He bought it.

294
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,040
Oh really?
He bought it off.

295
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,410
The guy that I sold it to thing hasn't 
been around.

296
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,280
Yeah.
It's a great looking car that,

297
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:25,570
that year,
like all those years,

298
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,670
like 70,
71,

299
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,480
those,
those second generation barracudas.

300
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:35,730
That's a special look and I think a lot 
of the hellcat is in that same kind of.

301
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,240
It's pretty close.
It's pretty close,

302
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:42,241
but I really wish it was the same size.
A hellcat is a hundred and 25 or 130 

303
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:47,320
percent inflated,
overinflated scale version of that.

304
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,140
That's those,
those 70,

305
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:54,190
71 Kudos are,
are the most valuable muscle cars that 

306
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,080
there are today.
Those Hemi ones right at the Hemi.

307
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:59,590
Kudos are the rarest and most valuable 
of the.

308
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,680
Of those they,
they're the ones that only get,

309
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,120
uh,
over over,

310
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,560
over,
like a million usually.

311
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,450
That's incredible.
For car.

312
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:08,890
That was what?
$30,000

313
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,840
new back in 1970 $5,000.
Was it?

314
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,290
Was it $5,000?
I don't know.

315
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,390
My reverse map doesn't go back that far.
Really?

316
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:21,040
Let's take a guess.
Let's say I think like five to 6,000

317
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,240
wouldn't be out of the question.
Hemi Cuda.

318
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,450
Alright,
perfect motor.

319
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,070
Let's go with 8,500
8,500

320
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,780
bucks.
Okay.

321
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,500
You go with 8,500?
What did I say?

322
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,700
30,000.
I'm going to read.

323
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,640
Reevaluate.
I think you need to reevaluate.

324
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,900
And four slash 26 Hemi Cuda.
I'm going to play a dirty game.

325
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,680
Prices,
right?

326
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:45,280
I'm going to go right above it.
Was Jamie coming in with a dollar 

327
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,200
fucking assault?
Love winning the show for 2016 for 

328
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Twenty six Hemi Cuda.
Which year?

329
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,880
Nineteen 77.
Yeah.

330
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,040
Years.
That's the goodyear.

331
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Well,
the two years of my favorite year of 70 

332
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,100
and 71.
Seventy one and the same.

333
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,540
I think 70 one's got four headlights.
Two.

334
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,310
Yeah.
70 also has the smaller grill face,

335
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:06,730
like the teeth are small in the front,
which is what I had.

336
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:10,000
I had a 70,
whereas 71 has the full real.

337
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:10,850
Yeah,
yeah,

338
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:12,650
yeah.
It's really more aggressive.

339
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,590
I think 71 might be a little bit better 
looking,

340
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,640
to be honest with you.
I can't recall if one year is more 

341
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,451
valuable than the other.
Seventy one I think is probably the 

342
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:22,670
best.
Are the results in Jamie window sticker?

343
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,760
Yeah.
Thirty four,

344
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,240
33,
3000.

345
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,890
Four hundred and $33.
Oh my God.

346
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,240
But Dalton with Jamie's $1 when I want 
it.

347
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,150
That's.
There it is.

348
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:33,200
Yeah.
Jamie,

349
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:38,201
pull up 1971.
Barracuda knows that is a.

350
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,560
that's my.
I think my favorite look and any muscle 

351
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:44,560
cars in 1971.

352
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,120
Barracuda.
That's just like this aggressive 

353
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,860
American some.
I mean that is.

354
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,850
That is about as fucking aggressive as a
grill can get.

355
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,900
It's got a mouthful of teeth.
It looks like a Barracuda really does 

356
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,660
actually fucking nailed it,
man.

357
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,270
They were better at actually,
I think naming things,

358
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:07,280
what they looked like back then.
God Damn.

359
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:12,281
That looks good.
I do still think the corvette stingray 

360
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:13,840
looks sting ray.
I think that's still a little bit.

361
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,850
The works kind of.
That looks like a fucking Barracuda 

362
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:18,850
though.
It does that.

363
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,021
It looks like it's going to get you.
I just found a way for you to spend 

364
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:23,021
another million dollars,
Joe Rogan.

365
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:24,020
I would never buy one of those.
I don't like.

366
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,320
I'm weird with Shit.
I don't like stock old cars.

367
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,700
What cars they drive,
like garbage.

368
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,520
That'd be why.
Yeah,

369
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,820
I zero interest in them.
You got your vet,

370
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:32,090
right?

371
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,770
But that's like a modified bob pro 
touring chassis and all hundred percent.

372
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,990
Yeah.
And it's got a [inaudible] oh,

373
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,800
so it drives a supercharged.
Yeah.

374
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,300
It tries to have a normal car charger 
driven.

375
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,100
The stock one of,
of that year.

376
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,390
No,
it's not good.

377
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,780
You're lucky guy up the street.
He hates me.

378
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,660
He,
uh,

379
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,790
we,
we live in the same block and he's got 

380
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:53,790
an original.
Who's one of those original guys?

381
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,791
He drives around with a paper boy hat on
and drives around the neighborhood lawn 

382
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,650
chair at cars and coffee and play 
fucking music.

383
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,950
Fuck those people out of his face.
When I told them that it was,

384
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:06,910
none of it was original except to shell.
I go,

385
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,500
it looks original.
It doesn't have a goddamn thing in it.

386
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,680
The inside,
I guess the shape of the dashboards 

387
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:14,680
original.
Oh,

388
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:14,690
Kim.
Well,

389
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:15,590
he's just.
I was like,

390
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:16,220
look man.

391
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,850
I liked him to drive like a car.
That works good.

392
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Yeah.
Like why is it bad to upgrade the 

393
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:24,880
brakes?
No,

394
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:24,880
it is not.
You're fine.

395
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,320
But this whole thing that it's somehow 
another like doing a disservice to the 

396
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,740
vehicle by upgrading the brakes.
These people are assholes.

397
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,640
Was cmps man.
It's an awesome if you're.

398
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,570
If you're going on the lawn at Pebble 
Beach,

399
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,580
you keep it original.
Yeah.

400
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,940
Other than that,
I mean especially look you ever.

401
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,510
I mean you,
you love the depths of the Internet.

402
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,780
Look at Los Angeles driving circa 1960 
and then Los Angeles driving today.

403
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,010
You know,

404
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:55,010
the heat,
the traffic on an old car is not meant 

405
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,130
to handle that shit.
You want to drive an old car here.

406
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,660
You need to upgrade a few things.
Cooling breaks.

407
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,080
When I find out that a dude just drives 
an old car,

408
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:07,860
I give them an extra level of respect.
You know what he's going through?

409
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,180
He,
Jimmy Smith,

410
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:10,970
my partner in the UFC now,
uh,

411
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,650
he used to work for Bella tour and now 
he works for the UFC.

412
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,990
He drives a 1968 firebird everyday.
Stock Stock,

413
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,370
stock,
seats,

414
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,780
brakes,
everything.

415
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:22,980
I'm like,
whoa.

416
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,340
Does he know what he's missing?
Have you let him driven drive your 

417
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,340
empire the fuck he doesn't give a fuck.
He likes old muscle cars.

418
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,590
He likes in the way they are.
He had a Camaro I think,

419
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:35,190
and I think his Camaro got hit by some 
asshole and totaled it.

420
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:36,000
So he's like,
all right,

421
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,940
there's another one guys in my hood in 
Venice where I live.

422
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,700
There's a lot of old,
old daily drivers for sure,

423
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,680
but I don't know,
I can't do it.

424
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:45,780
I just don't need that.
In my experience.

425
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:50,810
You've got to realize that you're not 
gonna be able to hit the brakes real 

426
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:50,810
good.
That's not worth it to me.

427
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,180
I like to drive too close to the people 
in front of it.

428
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,800
Well,
even if something steps out in the road,

429
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,550
you know.
I mean,

430
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:59,210
how many times have you been driving in 
a deer steps out in front of your conch?

431
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,280
A bunch.
I was driving down the road in a video 

432
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,041
that's been viewed about $3,
million times and a guy was dragging a 

433
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,011
log on like a 50 foot chain behind a 
ford explorer back and forth across the 

434
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,160
road.
Oh my God.

435
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,420
What the fuck was it?
The most viewed video on Reddit for 24 

436
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:17,790
hours.
Oh my God.

437
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,470
It was crazy.
Just dragging a log,

438
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,700
like a,
like a log,

439
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,850
like you know,
four feet by two feet.

440
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:26,970
Giant tree trunk log.
Fucking assholes out there.

441
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,330
You can't have shitty suspension like 
woop,

442
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,660
woop member trying to turn one of those 
cars.

443
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,420
Literally like a boat.
Oh my God.

444
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,280
But you know,
what else is like,

445
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,590
tires is a big difference too.
Like,

446
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,800
you know,
old Porsche's used to be called widow 

447
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,971
makers and shit,
but you take one of those old seventies 

448
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:49,590
turbo Porsche that you know,
there's volumes about how scary they are

449
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:52,770
to drive and you put them on Michelin 
Pilot Super Sport and you're like,

450
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,120
oh you,
you thought 300 horsepower was scary.

451
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:58,510
That's cute.
Funny.

452
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,410
You were scared of 300 horsepower.
Here's my log video.

453
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:01,860
Look,
wait,

454
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:03,840
watch this.
Boom log.

455
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,700
That is so crazy.
That is so god damn crazy.

456
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:10,020
You sitting there going what?

457
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,130
And I was in a supercharged Lamborghini 
Huracan making like 900 horsepower.

458
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,290
Look at that and look at the road.
This guy is just free dragging up.

459
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,120
Fucking that guy.
Just not seem wise,

460
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,190
but I totally,
I,

461
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,840
I choked.
I mean I had an opportunity to,

462
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,020
to throw a zinger there at this person 
and instead I just talked to myself and 

463
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,020
drove away.
No,

464
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,420
you're better off.
You're not going to fix that guy if he's

465
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:38,421
so stupid.
He's driving a giant log down a public 

466
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:40,410
road 30.
Look on the other side of the road.

467
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:42,720
Look at the marks like the log.
Actually,

468
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:46,950
as I go up,
you can see the mark of dirt like moving

469
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,960
back and forth across the road.
It was easier to see the other way I 

470
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:51,960
guess.
But yeah,

471
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,710
Jesus don't do that.
People.

472
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,590
Yeah,
I mean I guess he couldn't pick it up.

473
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:01,770
It looked too big.
So I guess I don't see how that's an 

474
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,271
appropriate.
So why would he be so convinced that the

475
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:06,820
log is going to stay attached to the 
chain?

476
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:11,821
I don't know.
How much does he know about logs and 

477
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:11,821
chains,
you know,

478
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:14,770
and he seemed like an advanced chain 
scientists in the specialty of logs.

479
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,810
Fucking assholes out there,
man.

480
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:22,190
Dragging a log behind a car on a public 
road has a big ass log to log,

481
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:24,640
right?

482
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,660
That chain is not going to hold up.
That law is going to bounce and go 

483
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,920
through someone's fucking windshield.
God Damn Man,

484
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,890
they got.
It wasn't mine.

485
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,760
It was borrowed like look,
look how long it is.

486
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,320
It's so crazy and I mean now that we 
need to like,

487
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,910
you know,
go back in the video,

488
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:49,000
but she,
that trail of whatever its leaves on the

489
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:50,710
road,
they're like that trail.

490
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,920
I had noticed starting like a couple,
like half a mile or so before that on 

491
00:21:56,291 --> 00:22:01,291
the road and the trail is going back and
forth across both lanes of traffic and 

492
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:05,860
there was a couple of signs down,
some crazy shit to.

493
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:08,950
You mean you're making obstacles for 
people that are driving,

494
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,190
especially if you're on a motorcycle.
If you're on a motorcycle and you're 

495
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,190
coming around,
you're killing,

496
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,320
you're gonna kill somebody.
Yeah,

497
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:18,040
that's legit.
Like date motorcycles don't want sand on

498
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:18,460
the road.

499
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,320
Yeah,
they just don't.

500
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,280
And you're putting it on the road 100 
percent with that smokers.

501
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,300
I also don't want to get clothes lined 
by logs and chains and my buddy a wiping

502
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:33,391
out on a turn on some sand was one of 
the major reasons why I was taking 

503
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:35,590
motorcycle safety classes.
I was trying to get my license and I was

504
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:37,630
going to get me in a couple of my 
friends for fear factor.

505
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:40,190
We were going to get a,
we're going to get motorcycles,

506
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:43,210
a couple of guys at work there and then 
as things went on,

507
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:45,490
we were like,
fuck this couple.

508
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,150
They,
they,

509
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,370
two of them went through with it.
Two of US bailed.

510
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,340
Alonzo Boden is all about the bikes,
the bikes,

511
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:57,060
how many books he broke in.
I don't know how he broke his arm on a 

512
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,910
bike a couple years ago.
I bet he did.

513
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,990
Yeah,
he doesn't.

514
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,550
He doesn't seem to,
uh,

515
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,080
think it's a bad risk.

516
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,640
I ride a scooter.
I have a little Yamaha scooter that I 

517
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,641
ride around Venice and running errands 
and going to my office and stuff like 

518
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,480
because I can lane split and it really 
makes my life a lot easier.

519
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,130
Oh yeah.
But I'm terrified.

520
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,280
I had a motorcycle and I wrote it in the
canyons maybe four or five times.

521
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:21,040
I was terrified.
I have no problem pushing a car,

522
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,690
you know,
a little bit in the canyons.

523
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:24,370
But on a bike like that,
gravel,

524
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,160
it's like,
yeah,

525
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,610
it's really fun.
I get it.

526
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:30,010
Motorcycle people.
I'm not saying you're wrong.

527
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,790
You're,
you're,

528
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,340
you're braver than me.
Yeah,

529
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,830
I've fruit or I've done,
I've gone through a lot of surgeries,

530
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,520
I know what it's like to rehab from 
serious injury and like I am just so not

531
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:44,521
into that I've,
I mean I've had two back surgeries in 

532
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:44,521
the same,
same spots.

533
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:47,180
So you've had those disectomy,
how was that?

534
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:48,270
Did it work for you?
Yeah,

535
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:53,330
yeah.
First one lasted 11 years and then my 

536
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,820
bad decisions led to it being reinjured 
and the second surgery was fine.

537
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,340
I'm in the best shape now that I've been
in,

538
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:02,150
in like 10 years.
So that's what you doing?

539
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,410
I do seven days a week of cardio,
so I built a gym in my house.

540
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,110
I did just seven days a week of cardio.
Yeah,

541
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:11,780
I got one of those arc trainers.
It's awesome.

542
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,720
Is that like a sort of like an 
elliptical?

543
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,440
It's like the hardest elliptical machine
I've ever used and it's.

544
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,360
I do like 45 minutes a day on that.
I use one of those really recently.

545
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,980
It was great.
It's amazing.

546
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,120
Yeah,
yeah,

547
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:32,130
yeah.
It's like a hotel with the video that 

548
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:32,130
bad boy.
It's a,

549
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,430
it's like a hotel quality,
so no pounding.

550
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:39,670
You're getting your cardio in.
Your body's not getting done in 45 

551
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,070
minutes.
I'll burn according to the machine.

552
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:42,050
I don't know how accurate these machine 
counters are,

553
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:47,051
but I'll burn like 850 calories in 45 
minutes and then I do three days a week 

554
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:51,170
of weight training for an hour getting 
in daily doubles three days a week and I

555
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:53,660
haven't.
I haven't had a cigarette since October.

556
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:56,300
Twenty 16.
The ARC trainer.

557
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:57,940
I have the one with the arms.
Yeah.

558
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,030
Yeah,
guy behind them.

559
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:02,180
It's get the arms.
It's serious.

560
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:03,290
Serious workout,
man.

561
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,390
I sweat.
It is a really good workout.

562
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,090
It really is.
So and then I do speed back.

563
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,790
I'll do 12 minutes a day on speed back,
which I like.

564
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,650
I decided to do this.
You could do.

565
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,940
That's what you.
How you hurt your arm?

566
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:14,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

567
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,760
We're,
we've been talking about tendon issues,

568
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,660
folks whose never had tendon issues and 
I never had them until this elbow.

569
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,250
I mean,
I've had it on elbows before,

570
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:25,130
but I did it smart and I didn't keep 
working out this time.

571
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:26,800
I tried to meet head my way through it.
Yeah.

572
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,260
Again,
uh,

573
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,330
it,
uh,

574
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,360
it flared up pretty bad to the point 
where I'm four months later it wasn't 

575
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,600
healed.
It's a slow healing thing,

576
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,100
right?
We're slowly tendons.

577
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,800
They don't have any blood supply,
so I got a bunch of shit.

578
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,840
Does that,
why the platelet rich plasma works so 

579
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:44,840
well because it just gets it right 
there.

580
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,320
It's very effective.
Yeah.

581
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,130
The other thing that's I think the most 
effect is what we're talking about is 

582
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,280
those therabands and actually it's the 
cheapest twisty,

583
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,660
a blue thing that I use.
It looks like a big Avatar Dildo.

584
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:01,810
And you hold it out in front of you.
I wish I had it with me and then he 

585
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:01,810
twisted like that.

586
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,710
Yeah.
And then I hold it like this and then I 

587
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:05,710
let it on.
Yeah.

588
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,050
So I just got one.
And then you like.

589
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,020
And when you do the untwisting it 
strengthens for,

590
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,020
for me,
that was my issue on the inside.

591
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:13,730
I'm on the outside so I go the other 
way.

592
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,420
Yeah,
there would be.

593
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:19,421
There's another one,
they'll show they have diagrams with 

594
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:19,421
different things you could do,
but it's different,

595
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,460
but it's just those kinds of muscles 
don't get strengthened a lot.

596
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,640
My muscles and my hands picking things 
up and I'm doing chin ups in rows and 

597
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,750
stuff like that.
But I was never doing anything twisty.

598
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,770
So started to add that the amount of 
driving I do isn't good for me.

599
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:38,890
Right.
For your back or my hands are for 

600
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:38,890
anything.
It's flux on my whole body.

601
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,100
Do you put a lumbar pad or anything?
No,

602
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:42,800
but most cars I drive have like real 
sporty,

603
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,980
you know,
seats and

604
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,980
a lot of them I'm lucky enough to have 
adjustable lumbar Mercedes right now is 

605
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,860
killing the seat game.
Mercedes seed game is so fire.

606
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,780
And what are they doing?
Just they um,

607
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,720
they work with this spinal center in 
Germany.

608
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:02,750
Oh Jesus.
To develop all their high end seats and 

609
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,810
the seats on the um,
the s class,

610
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:08,310
the amg s class is,
are so ridiculous.

611
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,830
Um,
it's like he,

612
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:11,900
they have it.
Okay.

613
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,600
So they have a simulated hot stone 
massage function that works.

614
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,860
It's boss as hell.
It's like a nine zone massage seat in 

615
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,670
the s class coupe.
So while you're driving,

616
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,700
it gives you a hot stone massage.
What is the difference between a hot 

617
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,680
stone massage and a regular massage?
The air pockets that get inflated,

618
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:35,420
like you know,
it's,

619
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,650
it's like behind the seat,
the leather.

620
00:27:37,651 --> 00:27:41,220
There's like these pockets of air,
like old reebok pumps,

621
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:41,460
right?

622
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,410
We're going to pump them up and inflate 
and deflate them in sequence to simulate

623
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:51,411
needing or whatever it is.
Well the Mercedes s class heats those 

624
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:56,091
pockets.
So they're actually the not with hot 

625
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:56,091
air.
The,

626
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,820
there's a thermal thing on the surface.
It's so gangster.

627
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,100
Whoa.
It feels like a hot stone massage.

628
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,840
It's awesome.
Yeah.

629
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,790
They took it to the next level they 
have.

630
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:08,020
And in fact I got the car,
you know,

631
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:11,220
it's like a $225,000
car and I got it for a week.

632
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:12,630
I drove it around a road trip.
All this.

633
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,200
I ended up writing 2,600
words on the seat.

634
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:23,290
The hot stone,
the fit has the fans behind your neck 

635
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,330
that blow the hot air because it was a 
convertible,

636
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,610
so.
Oh,

637
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,010
you got the convertible.
God Damn,

638
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,540
that's the backseat there.
Jamie.

639
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:35,541
Look at the.
Go for the front seat because that's 

640
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:35,541
the.
The.

641
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,430
The front seats are just just 
delightful.

642
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,600
It is,
but it is amazing that we are in the 

643
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,520
zones six zones.
It's amazing that we're in this time 

644
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,250
where the technology has gotten to this 
level where cars,

645
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:54,290
they,
they're working so hard to improve upon 

646
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:54,810
what is already ridiculous in terms of 
performance.

647
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:55,440
Yeah,
and have you,

648
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,770
have you experienced any of this semi 
autonomous stuff yet?

649
00:28:58,771 --> 00:28:59,650
None.
No,

650
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,070
I haven't.
I'm surprised as intellectually curious.

651
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:04,380
Interested in cars that drive 
themselves.

652
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:09,381
They can go fuck themselves.
You're not interested in a brief 

653
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:09,381
experience into the world.
I am.

654
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:09,710
I am,
and she should be Pam,

655
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,720
but for the most brilliant mind cars,
those cars are going to take away our 

656
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:14,720
right to Dr.

657
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,280
Oh,
that's why you should join the human 

658
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,280
driving association.
Alex.

659
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,670
this is real.
We're beginning of starting a lobbying 

660
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:22,670
association for the rights of human 
drivers.

661
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,170
Will it sounds like a fucking goof right
now,

662
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,670
but it doesn't matter to me.
No,

663
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,950
it doesn't to me.
Yeah.

664
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:33,050
Because this,
what we don't want to ever have is a 

665
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,340
situation where you summon your 
autonomous pod and you say,

666
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,740
take me to wherever.
And it goes,

667
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,760
no,
Joe,

668
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,480
you're not going there today because 
some political situation.

669
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:48,481
Yeah.
The government tells you the war on 

670
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:48,481
driving is here.
Pick your side.

671
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:49,930
Oh my God.
What the fuck is that?

672
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:52,420
An Rs America on the left there.
I think it's a sign.

673
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,350
I think that is.
It might be an older car by the career.

674
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,210
A whale tail.
Like my nine slash 11.

675
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,250
Yeah.
What years?

676
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,980
Your nine slash 11.
It's an 87.

677
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,880
Were built.
We're doing a safari build.

678
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,620
What does that mean?
Oh,

679
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,640
so you're making it like one of those 
offer rally cars.

680
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,530
Car?
Yeah.

681
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,230
It's called,
uh,

682
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:14,270
the Kenya project.
My friend Lee keen is a reporter racing 

683
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,941
driver and he built one for himself and 
it is the most glorious thing I've ever 

684
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:23,401
driven.
And it's everything that you love about 

685
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:26,500
a nine slash 11 applies to this.
I'm on loose surface.

686
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:27,820
There it is.
That's your car.

687
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,130
That's not my car.
My car is going to look like that,

688
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:33,370
although it will be a different color 
and have a roof rack and it'll be,

689
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,560
it'll be slightly,
slightly different.

690
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:40,710
That seems crazy.
That actually is a Richard Tuttle build 

691
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,510
from England.
He's a keen sofar k,

692
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:48,511
e n and you'll see closer to mine 
tuttle's the guy that made a greencard.

693
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,440
Oh,
that's my.

694
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:53,480
This is my video of driving lease car.
Um,

695
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,400
and uh,
it is.

696
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,330
See,
look,

697
00:30:58,331 --> 00:30:59,140
I was fatter there.

698
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:05,980
So it's just drifty woods,
oversteer and,

699
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,760
and you know,
the,

700
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:11,790
that,
that rear engine kind of snapped back 

701
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:11,860
thing that everyone's all afraid of.
Nine slash 11.

702
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,890
The pendulum thing.
Will you get that when you slide and 

703
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,940
then it catches and comes back on a 
loose surface.

704
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:22,210
There's no catch a.
So you slide it,

705
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:27,390
but you don't have the scary snap back.
It just drifts in the gums back drift.

706
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,020
You know,
there's Lee,

707
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:32,500
he's building the thing that's probably 
really good to have a rear engine bias.

708
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,120
It is real,
it is the most controllable.

709
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:42,150
Delightful.
And you've got four inches of extra 

710
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:42,490
suspension travel.
So La speed bumps,

711
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,280
ruts.
Think about this in Los Angeles.

712
00:31:45,281 --> 00:31:50,281
Right?
So you're going to drive this rally car 

713
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:50,281
around La?
Yeah,

714
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:50,281
yeah,
yeah.

715
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:51,790
It's not a race car.
It's a street car.

716
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,480
Wow.
That's a streetcar.

717
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,160
Yeah.
And then,

718
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:59,161
you know,
that looks like so much fun trying to 

719
00:31:59,161 --> 00:31:59,161
get in the dirt.

720
00:31:59,161 --> 00:31:59,161
Oh my God.
We have so much desert here.

721
00:31:59,161 --> 00:32:00,940
No one cares.
You got to have Mirage.

722
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,340
There's trails like there's no speed 
limits.

723
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:05,140
Nobody gives a shit.
I got to be honest.

724
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:09,160
There's two videos that made me get 
really interested in older porsches.

725
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:14,250
One of them was the Chris Harris build 
with the tuttle and another one was you 

726
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,520
driving that project?
Nasty cough.

727
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,070
Joey seely.
He's a local as well.

728
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,570
That car.
I was like,

729
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,460
oh,
that's it.

730
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,350
Yeah,
that's it.

731
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,210
Just like get it down to the raw dog.
Yeah.

732
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:27,490
He took everything out of that car.
And Richard Tuttle,

733
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:30,160
who did Chris's car in England is like 
the rally,

734
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,330
you know,
master.

735
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,750
He's like,
uh,

736
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,590
there's,
there's a project nasty.

737
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,450
And there's joey who built it.
And he also,

738
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:40,370
I love the little things,
he did make the exhaust come through the

739
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:45,371
rear bumper and those funky wheels on it
and the fact there's no carpeting and 

740
00:32:45,371 --> 00:32:49,631
all,
like everything inside was stripped 

741
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:49,631
away.

742
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:51,410
His instagram,
his emotion engineering and that car has

743
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:54,020
been through a few changes since this 
video has made.

744
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:56,270
It looks a little different now that he 
changed the wheels.

745
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:57,230
Right?
Different wheels,

746
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,870
different like stairs,
a bunch of different stuff,

747
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:02,090
but it's amazing.
And that guy,

748
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,220
um,
he used to be a part of this business.

749
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:06,800
BBI autosport.
He left to go start his own business,

750
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:10,700
emotion engineering.
And he is a master of chassis setup.

751
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,660
Yeah,
I believe it.

752
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,770
Yeah.
That's a very,

753
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:15,110
very impressive video.
It's a very interesting video.

754
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,080
And that's not like the highest 
horsepower vehicle,

755
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:18,620
right?
No,

756
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:23,621
it was really light though.
It was I think how many horsepower did 

757
00:33:23,621 --> 00:33:23,621
have,
I don't remember.

758
00:33:23,621 --> 00:33:24,530
Maybe three.
Seventy five.

759
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:25,550
Three 80.
I mean it was,

760
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,860
it was fast.
It was not a slouch at all,

761
00:33:27,861 --> 00:33:32,861
but you know,
have you seen what singer is doing now 

762
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:32,861
with this air cooled engine?

763
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:35,750
It's crazy what you sent me.
That whole thing of the price difference

764
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:40,751
between a nine slash 11 engine air 
cooled engine that's got 200 horsepower 

765
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:43,880
versus one's got $500 and be like,
wow.

766
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,910
Yeah,
the exponential curve of Porsche 

767
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:48,910
horsepower costs.
So it's really scary stuff.

768
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,100
Stan was $250,000.
Yeah,

769
00:33:51,101 --> 00:33:51,830
so it was like,
okay,

770
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:55,460
if you buy an engine,
an engine on a stand,

771
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,460
you want that engine.
This is a porsche air cooled,

772
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,520
so a porsche engine for a porsche that 
is earlier than 1995.

773
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,620
I'm 300 horsepower is gonna run you 
about 40 grand and that's a ton of money

774
00:34:11,751 --> 00:34:16,751
for not a lot of horsepower.
400 horsepower will run you about 100 

775
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:19,880
grand.
I mean 100,000.

776
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,890
That's an engine on a stand.
Nothing else.

777
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:26,030
You want 500 horsepower out of that 
motor seawater and $50,000

778
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,930
just for the end.
Just for the edge.

779
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Why is that?
Because that sounds so crazy in 

780
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,670
comparison to other cars because a lot 
of techniques that you would use to make

781
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:39,080
horsepower and other cars you cannot 
apply to a porsche engine.

782
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:44,470
You're limited on displacement size,
so it's not like you could shove like a 

783
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:47,711
nine Liter v eight in there,
like a four point two is about as big 

784
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:52,040
displacement as you can get in that 
case.

785
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,070
And that's with like a stroker crank and
board out.

786
00:34:55,071 --> 00:35:00,071
So you're increasing both the length,
the Pistons move and the size of the 

787
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:00,820
whole,
um,

788
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:06,310
to get to the 500 horsepower mark,
you have to run some highly experimental

789
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,440
cylinder heads and singer to do that.
I don't know if Chris has been on the 

790
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:14,150
show recently,
but he's working with singer to develop.

791
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:19,660
Um,
there's a company called Williams that 

792
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,061
has a formula one team.
They are developing the cylinder heads 

793
00:35:22,061 --> 00:35:24,740
for singer.
So Chris Harrison is a part of this.

794
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:27,460
He's doing development driving for them.
That's great.

795
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,230
Which is a good decision.
That's amazing decision.

796
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,810
Plus the videos will be epic,
right?

797
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:37,811
So most of a,
they're doing a four valve air cooled 

798
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:38,040
head,

799
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,100
which as far as I know has never been 
done before.

800
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:42,540
All your,
your engine,

801
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:45,330
my engine,
all the are our two valve engines and,

802
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,430
and they're doing a four valve engine.
So,

803
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,960
um,
it's going to cost a million and a half 

804
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,370
dollars.
Well the engine is 250 grand.

805
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,170
This is why it's so crazy.
Custom cars or a million dollars.

806
00:35:58,171 --> 00:35:59,040
Now.
Isn't that nuts?

807
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,030
I mean you really want,
if you really want something next level,

808
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,520
it can easily be.
Emily knows Jamie,

809
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:09,210
pull up that new singer,
nine slash 11 singer nine slash 11.

810
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:12,300
And the Williams Williams engine.
It's green,

811
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,510
but it's got a lot of that.
Um,

812
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,760
what is,
who's the Japanese gentleman who takes 

813
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:19,760
those porsches and our web?
Yeah,

814
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,450
it's got a lot of that to it.
Well,

815
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:23,220
alright,
so our web is really interesting because

816
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:28,221
in Japan there's the singer,
don't you think that's a God damn 

817
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:28,221
gorgeous car?

818
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:30,990
Don't you think it's an odd choice to 
artificially different.

819
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,560
Stop please.
Sexy.

820
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,470
That artificially differentiate like the
way he's got the fender flares,

821
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,500
he's just,
he's making him like he had a glue them 

822
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,890
on carbon fiber.
The whole car is carbon fiber.

823
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:48,891
Why did,
why did they fake like they had like 

824
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:48,891
extensions.
Okay.

825
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:53,661
So I don't want to disappoint you,
but that is a rendering and not a 

826
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:56,841
picture of an actual car.
Far as I know he actual car does not 

827
00:36:56,841 --> 00:37:00,681
exist and I think if I had to guess they
put those over fender lines on the 

828
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:06,801
rendering.
So you would specifically notice that 

829
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:08,550
they have widened it a.
That standard would be if I had to guess

830
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:11,520
the final car may not actually have a 
seam there.

831
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,750
You know what man?
I'm not.

832
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,700
I'm not mad if it does.
It looks amazing.

833
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,140
Champion.
Can you make that bigger again?

834
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:21,470
It's so real.
That's crazy that that's not a 

835
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,170
photograph like a render.
Almost certain.

836
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:26,910
That's not a real car.
I'm almost certain it's not a real car.

837
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,900
Hire little.
I could be wrong.

838
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:35,901
There could.
There could be someone's screaming at 

839
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:35,901
their whatever right now saying I'm 
wrong,

840
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:39,921
but I'm pretty sure reflections in the 
window in the last three years.

841
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,370
They're good at this dude.
Well,

842
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:44,580
I play a video game.
I absolutely believe it.

843
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:46,770
I'm not arguing against it.
I'm just saying it's so good.

844
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,820
Yeah,
but anyway,

845
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:50,010
if they'd make a car like that,
Holy Shit.

846
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:51,200
That's a gorgeous car.
Oh yeah.

847
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,210
And they will and it'll look like that,
but it may not have those seams.

848
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,240
It's pretty similar to what their car 
looks like wider.

849
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:02,241
Much different than the wider.
I saw one of those that might've been 

850
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:02,730
the best looking car I've ever seen in 
my life.

851
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,970
It was a silver,
like a metallic silver,

852
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:10,470
like a bright silver singer,
and it was online understated.

853
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:14,110
It's like Lori's damn.
See if you find that bright silver,

854
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,520
a silver singer.
Have you seen one in person before?

855
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:20,850
A close dude,
your mind would be blown.

856
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:25,890
They have at a minimum,
minimum 45 or $50,000

857
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,680
of leather in one of those cars and the 
interior,

858
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,490
the leather work in the interior of 
those cars is unbelievable.

859
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,770
Beyond anything from any manufacturer 
today.

860
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,560
Really?

861
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,710
Uh,
yeah.

862
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,870
That's it.
That's a sexy motherfucker.

863
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,440
Damn.
That's a good looking car.

864
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,670
Yup.
That's very,

865
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:45,580
very nice.
What is it about certain shapes,

866
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:46,690
right?
There's certain.

867
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,420
What singer does is they distill,
you know,

868
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:54,040
the best of each generation of car into 
one car.

869
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,390
And so you're looking at a highly 
idealized nine slash 11,

870
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,840
but you can't exactly picture what came 
from where and why.

871
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,550
Yeah,
it's gangster.

872
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,410
And those folks,
those wheels,

873
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,020
for whatever reason,
they just work like,

874
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:11,680
especially that green car that we go 
back to that green card,

875
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,990
they made them all they made.
I'm real big on the green card,

876
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:16,930
but the design works so well.
There's the Williams engine.

877
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,330
God Damn it looks good.
Yeah,

878
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,230
that's perfect.
So scroll down Jamie the Williams.

879
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:23,860
Look at this.
So,

880
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,050
so you see,
look at the air intakes.

881
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:28,690
That's where your rear windows would be.

882
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,800
So there are no rear windows,
there are only those air intakes that go

883
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:34,750
directly into the engine.
Cool.

884
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:36,690
That furnace off.
That's.

885
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,540
No,
not cooling.

886
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,480
That's the actual air intake to get the 
end of the combustion chamber.

887
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:40,920
Okay.
Yeah,

888
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:41,440
yeah,
yeah.

889
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,970
The cooling,
it's air cooled,

890
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:47,020
so you see that silver kind of nipple on
the right side there.

891
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,010
That's the center of the fan.
It gets cooled in from the back.

892
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:56,011
They're like this is basically the same 
size as a regular inline six flats.

893
00:39:56,171 --> 00:39:56,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

894
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:59,290
Roughly that the engine itself is 
roughly the same size.

895
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,350
Yeah.
So what they've done is just engineer it

896
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:03,530
to the Max.
Oh yeah.

897
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,130
Well they have the.
They have what are inferior,

898
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,970
the most advanced cylinder heads ever 
put onto an air cooled 9:11.

899
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:13,480
It looks incredible and they're going to
stick that in a car.

900
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:14,950
That was originally what?

901
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,020
Ninety three,
something like that.

902
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,860
Yeah,
something like that.

903
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,180
Yeah,
91 to 94.

904
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:25,410
Isn't it funny though that there's 
something unbelievably appealing about 

905
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:30,000
those air cooled cars that is willing to
have these rich people pay a million 

906
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,760
dollars or at least the current singers?
A half million dollars from this car 

907
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,400
just because you feel it more when you 
drive it.

908
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:41,401
It's just got a feel to it.
There's a certain kind of mechanical 

909
00:40:41,401 --> 00:40:41,860
brilliance to it that's really,
really.

910
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,900
You can't.
It's in comparable.

911
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:45,250
Really.
It's very unique.

912
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,630
Yeah.
Well,

913
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,690
there's something about those old cars,
particularly the ones that don't have 

914
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,400
power steering.
You get a thrill out of them.

915
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:57,070
There's a weird thrill even when you're 
not even driving fast,

916
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,970
especially with a porsche when you.
When you have no power steering combined

917
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:04,240
with front engine car,
it sucks when no power steering,

918
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:07,420
when the engine's in the back is okay 
because the front of the car is pretty.

919
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,210
Is Pretty light so you don't need too 
much muscle,

920
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,000
but the nine slash 11 steering is just 
super,

921
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:14,710
super direct.
Yeah.

922
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:17,020
It's super direct and it's just.
I don't know,

923
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:17,590
man.
It just.

924
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,290
It just feels like a different thing 
you're doing.

925
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,620
I had a buddy that had a a folks wagon 
bug growing up,

926
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,790
didn't have a lot of power in it,
but those Volkswagen bugs,

927
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,820
those fucking things like when you drive
them around,

928
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,040
they give you a little smile on your 
face because you're driving like

929
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,480
this little tiny thing that feels 
completely connected with the road.

930
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:43,770
Very capable,
but it's like you're smiling when you 

931
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:47,681
drive one of those.
It's the ultimate Volkswagen is they're 

932
00:41:47,681 --> 00:41:49,010
taking in Germany,
they take the buses,

933
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:54,011
the micro buses,
and they and they chop them down so 

934
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,090
they're compressed and they put full 
porsche floor pan drive,

935
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:58,400
train,
and so remember that nine,

936
00:41:58,401 --> 00:41:59,180
nine,
six turbo.

937
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:03,500
You had the all wheel drive,
so they'll put that whole floor pan on a

938
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,760
microbus and they'll go to like track 
days and beat up on race cars.

939
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,460
It's crazy.
They're look seriously.

940
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:10,840
Look,
here's,

941
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:15,890
here's one that is so crazy.
Five hundred and 30 horsepower portion 

942
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:15,890
nine,
nine,

943
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,450
three by turbo powered Volkswagen 
microbus.

944
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:18,950
Same.
Look in the rear window.

945
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:22,370
See the intake on the rear window there.
That's so crazy.

946
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,110
And that's on a racetrack.
Oh my God.

947
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,870
And it probably weighs nothing,
right?

948
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,460
Nothing.
And I mean,

949
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:30,620
look what happens.
God forbid you crash one of those.

950
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,360
Oh Wow.
There's crazy people taking a vw bugs 

951
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:41,360
and put Porsche engines in them.
I know they've been doing that.

952
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,140
Yeah.
Well the common one is a suit.

953
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,300
Oh,
the old 3:56

954
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:46,290
engines award.
No,

955
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:46,610
no,
no.

956
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:49,340
I think someone was putting an older 
nine slash 11 engine in it,

957
00:42:49,341 --> 00:42:51,380
or a nine slash nine slash 12,
nine slash 12 engine.

958
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:58,340
Nine twelves are people are paying way 
too much money for them.

959
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,450
Stop it.
Yeah.

960
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,850
They're like like 30,
$40,000.

961
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,410
Really?
They're so slow.

962
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,170
Yeah.
That's a slow ass.

963
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,200
Yeah,
yeah,

964
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,800
yeah.
You need to have like I get that.

965
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:12,290
It's about feel and yet nine slash nine 
slash 12 slash five field,

966
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:17,291
but at a certain point there has to be 
some pace associated him know when they 

967
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:20,990
made those cars it was the same shell on
the outside.

968
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:21,950
Is it nine slash 11?
Yeah.

969
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:26,951
Yeah.
They just like d contented it cheap and 

970
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:26,951
everything and then put it interesting.
That old engine,

971
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:31,020
if somebody wanted a hot rod or nine 
slash 12 out and like put a crazy nine,

972
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,650
nine three engine in it and to all the 
suspension,

973
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:35,190
it would still be a nine.
12.

974
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,470
Isn't that weird?
There's people that convert nine twelves

975
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,340
into nine slash 11 all the time.

976
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,800
Yeah.
But people know.

977
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,450
Yeah.
Care.

978
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,460
No,
but that's what's so crazy about it is 

979
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,131
that you're essentially.
It's the same good stuff is the nine 

980
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:52,310
slash 11,
what it looks like on the outside,

981
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,290
but do the numbers match.
That's the thing,

982
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,320
but the difference with Porsche people,
I mean the difference between $40,000

983
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:05,231
and $400,000
will be the most minute insignificant 

984
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,750
bullshit of this one was delivered with,
you know,

985
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,800
leather covered vents and a leather 
covered fusebox and a fucking Fuchsia 

986
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,760
steering wheel and it had the 
lightweight glass.

987
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:19,160
So that one's 400 grand in that one's 
40.

988
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,890
I mean that's really what it is.
That's the only muscle cars.

989
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:28,090
Same thing.
This was one of four delivered and plum 

990
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:31,301
crazy and automatic transmission on a 
Tuesday with a white roof and a cum 

991
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:32,340
stain in the back feet

992
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,670
from the factory.
I'd love those auctions where you see 

993
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:38,370
pitch to greed and people's eyes just go
in off.

994
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,920
The funny thing is when they people like
will,

995
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:44,520
they'll get in a bidding war and overpay
for something by 40 grand and still feel

996
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:47,040
like they want.
They feel like they score.

997
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,050
I'll give her lungs that motherfucker 
didn't get it.

998
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:54,410
I went to Barrett,
Jackson for the first time ever this 

999
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:54,410
year.
I had to see it in person.

1000
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:54,710
It's a shit show.
It's an,

1001
00:44:54,711 --> 00:44:56,230
it's an absolute shit show.
Yeah,

1002
00:44:56,231 --> 00:44:56,620
yeah,
yeah.

1003
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,460
It's crazy.
And you know,

1004
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,620
it's in Scottsdale and,
and,

1005
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,830
but a Barrett,
Jackson itself,

1006
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:08,820
what they don't show you on TV is that 
you can buy anything.

1007
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:11,340
They're like,
you can buy fat.

1008
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,930
They had a,
uh,

1009
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,160
a jet turbine powered fan boats.
Whoa.

1010
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,200
That you could buy like it's,
it's like the auction and I'm going 

1011
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,670
under and then like a mile of swap Midi 
Shit.

1012
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:31,070
And you could buy custom made cowboy 
boots and tempurpedic beds and you know,

1013
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,520
home furnishings and terrible art and 
watches.

1014
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:38,460
And it was a massage chairs.
Anything you can think of.

1015
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:39,600
Whoa.
It was,

1016
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:44,660
it was just such a,
like Sea of commerce dam and uh,

1017
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:50,570
there's like a lot of cars that don't 
make tv that are either amazing or very,

1018
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:54,390
very sad and in their own way.
Do you have to do to get in there?

1019
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:58,050
Do you have to there like a quotation 
thing to just walk in?

1020
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,610
No,
to set a car in there.

1021
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,300
Oh,
you just,

1022
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,430
you on their website and apply to sell a
car.

1023
00:46:02,431 --> 00:46:05,030
I think.
I don't think there's any.

1024
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,830
I think are happy to take your money and
try and sell your car.

1025
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:12,831
I don't think there's any restriction 
guy like Eric Andre from going there I 

1026
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,150
would like.
And just pinto.

1027
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,290
I don't.
I mean,

1028
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:21,291
I don't know.
I don't think anything other than 

1029
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:21,291
someone figuring out the joke before he 
did it,

1030
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:23,370
but I don't think much.
I think you could probably do it,

1031
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,280
but for the most part it's people that 
are pretty serious about cars.

1032
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,390
It was a lot of dealers.
There was a lot more dealers that seemed

1033
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:35,391
like they were selling to each other in 
terms of the actual buying and the 

1034
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:35,391
selling.
But yeah,

1035
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:37,800
I mean there's a lot of nascar jackets 
out there,

1036
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,770
lot of nascar jackets,
and then you see the,

1037
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,980
they have some of the higher end options
to which sort of resemble the pebble 

1038
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:46,470
beach ones.
Do you still have that crazy corvette?

1039
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:47,880
Sold it.
Oh,

1040
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,130
I have a crazy mustang now.
What'd you get?

1041
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,480
Oh,
that one?

1042
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

1043
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:56,370
It's on the cover of carcraft this month
and it's in speed hunters as well.

1044
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,550
It did a great article in it and speed.
Hunter's dad is a ridiculous car.

1045
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,930
It's awesome to her rutledge on your 
show and you guys were on Fox bodies.

1046
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,660
You were him called it like the worst 
piece of shit ever.

1047
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:10,650
Fuck you.
Why did you decide to soup up that car?

1048
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,320
Because car what I wanted in high 
school,

1049
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:15,840
but like it's my highest.
It's the high school,

1050
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,250
the high school reliving car.
Oh Wow.

1051
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:23,390
We'll over the top.
Imagine pulling up to high school with 

1052
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:23,550
that thing.
She'd go back in a time machine,

1053
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:28,820
bro.
I went to my actual 10 year high school 

1054
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,161
reunion in a orange Lamborghini as a 
goof and there was literally not a 

1055
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:34,320
single soul outside when I parked it up 
upfront,

1056
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:38,590
zero people's arrival.
It couldn't have been more that shit.

1057
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:44,620
Isn't that funny?
Like that's what you want a car like 

1058
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:44,620
that.

1059
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:44,620
It's like 80 percent of rival.
Yeah.

1060
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,160
Yeah.
A hundred percent right?

1061
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,490
One hundred percent up and getting out.
If they see the Lamborghini,

1062
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:53,491
there's my mustang and you see the 
Lamborghini on the way out of the 

1063
00:47:53,491 --> 00:47:53,491
reunion.
It's really lame.

1064
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:57,460
It just was not the best looking year.
No.

1065
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:02,470
Look,
I have the notch back and the notch 

1066
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:02,470
stack is better.
Mine was a police car.

1067
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:03,130
Was it?
Yeah,

1068
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:05,110
it was a highway patrol car.
Wow.

1069
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:08,710
See that's the notch back there.
And uh,

1070
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:11,130
it was cheaper to get those.
I remember you can get the five point.

1071
00:48:11,131 --> 00:48:11,770
Oh,
engine.

1072
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,660
And the point of that is the police cars
were the lightest ones.

1073
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,150
So no air conditioning,
no sunroof,

1074
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:21,010
no fog lights,
no power windows.

1075
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,150
Power door locks.
So that was the Lightest v eight powered

1076
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:27,250
Mustang ever made.
Look at my interior.

1077
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:32,380
I love crazy fabrics so much.
That interiors,

1078
00:48:32,381 --> 00:48:33,760
bad ass Cholo.

1079
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,250
Fantastic.
I actually like it.

1080
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,220
I thought it would hate that.
Now it's like a seventies.

1081
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,980
Outdoor patio furniture.
Keep that image back up there.

1082
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:45,310
I liked the um,
we're getting joe and interior today.

1083
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:47,840
I can never go like that,
but just leave that there.

1084
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,330
Like the gauges,
man.

1085
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:52,030
Everything you did there.
Porsche style steering wheel.

1086
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:55,500
I love that.
I love the shifters at hearst.

1087
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,530
Yeah,
her shifter.

1088
00:48:56,531 --> 00:49:01,531
And then the center tray in between the 
recaro seats is from a 73 Mercedes to 

1089
00:49:01,531 --> 00:49:03,220
80.
And then,

1090
00:49:03,221 --> 00:49:08,221
uh,
the pattern came from a modern fabrics 

1091
00:49:08,221 --> 00:49:08,950
and it's like an outdoor patio furniture
fabric.

1092
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:11,800
So it's uv resistant and spill 
resistant.

1093
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,870
What do those wheels Jamie Click on 
those wheels and the righthand side.

1094
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,580
What?
Where the wheels.

1095
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:16,750
The wheels?
I have a,

1096
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:19,990
it's called the hre rs one.
Oh.

1097
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:23,410
Which is a three piece forged wheel.
Uh,

1098
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:27,730
and I'm running to 95 tires at all four 
corners.

1099
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:31,000
So there are 18 by 10 and a half at all.
Four corners.

1100
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,000
They're awesome.
We must handle amazing.

1101
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:34,910
Oh,
it's sticks.

1102
00:49:34,911 --> 00:49:39,911
So it sticks like a gt three.
It turns in so hard and I'm running the 

1103
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:42,190
tires or sport cup tubes which are like 
the gt three tires.

1104
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,890
And what is this car way you think?
Thirty one.

1105
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:45,500
10.
Well,

1106
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,540
so it's pretty good.
It's got really good breaks,

1107
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:53,020
really good handling.
It's medium fast.

1108
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:55,600
It's about 350 horsepower.
So it gets quick enough.

1109
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,030
You're going to leave the engine the way
it is?

1110
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,400
Well,
it has a crate motor in it,

1111
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,040
right,
which it could use some more,

1112
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:08,570
could use a little more and so if I keep
the car long term,

1113
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:13,090
I'm going to take out that engine and 
put in the Gt 3:50

1114
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,200
if I keep the car long term.
How many horsepower is the GT?

1115
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:18,180
Three.
Five,

1116
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,070
25.
But it revs to 8,200.

1117
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:23,330
That's what it's really about.
You know,

1118
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:26,170
I heard one of those in a video.
That's a great insight.

1119
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,010
Doesn't sound anything like a Mustang.
It

1120
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,850
doesn't,
it sounds like a something,

1121
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:30,860
uh,
more Italian.

1122
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:31,490
Yeah.
Most.

1123
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:33,160
Yeah.
I was going to sound like a Ferrari or.

1124
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:36,410
Well they do a different firing order 
and they also,

1125
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:41,411
I think it's,
someone's going to hurry me if that's 

1126
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:43,931
wrong,
but the flat plain crank changes the 

1127
00:50:43,931 --> 00:50:44,660
sound gt 3:50
exhaust,

1128
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:48,230
2018 gt 3:50.
It's pretty glorious.

1129
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,960
Yeah.
Well I'm terrified that they're going to

1130
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:54,020
come out with that gt 500 and I'm going 
to fall in love.

1131
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,540
It could happen.
It could happen.

1132
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,960
It has a very uh,
yeah,

1133
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:05,000
yeah.
That sounds amazing.

1134
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,520
Nope,
I think you have one of my videos open 

1135
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:10,520
in the background,
Jamie,

1136
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,080
because I'm hearing double God dammit 
Jamie Lists.

1137
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,840
But look at that.

1138
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,670
Oh,
that sounds so good.

1139
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,680
It's not,
it's a very unlike anything else on the 

1140
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:23,680
road.
Very distinctive.

1141
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,460
So that's uh,
that's,

1142
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:27,170
that's uh,
one of the most special engines.

1143
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,000
Thirty 700 pounds.
They're all heavy.

1144
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:38,270
Why can anybody figure that out?
Because people.

1145
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,090
Lighter people want features,
right?

1146
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,150
Everybody though some people don't want 
that.

1147
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:47,330
That's why people like you and I are so 
fascinated by something like singer.

1148
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:52,370
I'm like,
you don't want to spend that kind of 

1149
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:52,490
money.
You can't have light and cheap and fast.

1150
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:55,310
You gotta you gotTa pick one.
If you want light and sheep,

1151
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:56,360
you,
it's your Miata.

1152
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,120
You know,
you can't have a.

1153
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:03,660
If they're,
if they had a 3000 pound Mustang that 

1154
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,150
had the features that people demand from
a modern car,

1155
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,480
it would be $200,000.
You'd,

1156
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,560
you'd have a Ferrari,
you know?

1157
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:15,370
Yeah.
But even for ours aren't that light 

1158
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:15,370
anymore.

1159
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:15,370
That's true.
That's true.

1160
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:15,370
Nothing is like,
well,

1161
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,310
what is the lightest thing you could 
buy?

1162
00:52:16,311 --> 00:52:20,480
Like a Porsche boxster.
There's a lotus.

1163
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:25,310
Lotus for 10 is under 3000 pounds I 
think,

1164
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:27,200
which is really,
really,

1165
00:52:27,201 --> 00:52:28,340
really,
really nice car.

1166
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,480
I drove that little one to little 
league.

1167
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,170
Yeah,
trove that a few years back.

1168
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,240
Yeah.
So you've already beat you up like that.

1169
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:37,070
Does it didn't have any horsepower 
though?

1170
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,890
It was the other one?
No,

1171
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:44,891
not the core of the.
Exceeds the really the one where it 

1172
00:52:44,891 --> 00:52:45,590
doesn't have any floor panels.
He doesn't have anything.

1173
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,230
I was like,
this is kind of interesting because it's

1174
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:51,980
like a little go cart.
It doesn't load us this thing.

1175
00:52:51,981 --> 00:52:52,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

1176
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,070
So that's what I drove.
That's the evora sport for 10.

1177
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,560
I just drove that and it's really,
really good.

1178
00:52:57,561 --> 00:52:58,850
Yeah.
Really Nice.

1179
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,830
And that's also a manual transmission?
It is,

1180
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:03,860
yeah.
It's a super charged camry engine,

1181
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,240
believe it or not.
Really?

1182
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,500
Yeah.
How many horsepower?

1183
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,960
Four hundred and 10.
Supercharged carries.

1184
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:14,380
Beautiful car.
It's really good looking and it stopped 

1185
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:14,570
that thing.
It's got a titanium exhaust.

1186
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:15,830
God,
that's so unique.

1187
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,200
You know,
in a sea of nine slash 11,

1188
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,560
it does stand out.
Why you would like that car.

1189
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:24,110
I think that that would be a good one 
for you.

1190
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:25,980
Like you need another one.
That's a

1191
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,270
pretty cartoon,
but that's the other one.

1192
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,050
That's the least.
Yeah.

1193
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:33,080
Yeah.
The elise is the one that I drove that 

1194
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,080
gray one that you just clicked on.
Jamie.

1195
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,390
I drove that.
That's a beautiful looking car,

1196
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:35,550
but it's got no balls.
No,

1197
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:39,400
but you can stun those.
Like this is crazy how slow the is.

1198
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,120
They made some.
You might have driven the smaller engine

1199
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:43,800
when they made some that were a little 
faster.

1200
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,890
Yeah.
The base one was like 180 horsepower and

1201
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,080
then they go up to,
to 60 or to 80.

1202
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,070
But there's something thrilling about 
it.

1203
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,040
Like driving a flea.
Yeah.

1204
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:57,780
So how much does that thing way think?
Twenty 500 or something.

1205
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:59,240
It's like,
yeah,

1206
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:02,820
it's nothing and it's beautiful.
They just make beautiful cars.

1207
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:06,810
Those lotuses are that.
They will be $30,000

1208
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:09,570
used cars until the end of time.
The Elise?

1209
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,800
Yeah,
absolutely.

1210
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:14,130
Bottomed out at 30 grand and you can buy
them and sell them at 30 grand all day.

1211
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Isn't it funny how cars were worth 
almost nothing and then like a 73 Rs 

1212
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,310
America.
It wasn't.

1213
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:26,220
It wasn't an rs America just at Rs.
Three RS is worth like a million dollars

1214
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,920
now.
It used to be worth $20,000

1215
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,800
just a few years ago.
Like how did that happen?

1216
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:36,950
I remember I saw those for sale and 
someone saying this is the perfect 

1217
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:37,860
Porsche.
It's not the most powerful.

1218
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,990
It's only like 225 horsepower,
something like that,

1219
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:42,930
but it's so light and so fun to drive.
And I was like,

1220
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,480
get the fuck out of here with 225 
horsepower.

1221
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:46,410
Well,
it's like you know,

1222
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:49,350
the world,
the world has become more automated,

1223
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:51,300
right?
Everything is faster,

1224
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,360
more efficient,
but less involved and less mechanical.

1225
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:58,470
And at the same time you've got a,
especially with Porsche,

1226
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:02,580
a younger audience,
a very wealthy audience,

1227
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:08,170
you know that as has really decided to 
use the older collector cars is a 

1228
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,460
currency that you can drive and 
investments and just a lot of rich 

1229
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:13,800
people out there right now.

1230
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:16,480
And they're not making any more.
Nineteen 73,

1231
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,190
nine slash 11.
Yeah.

1232
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,000
That's one of the things that people 
have a real problem with,

1233
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:22,440
singer is they're taking those cars and 
chopping them the fuck up.

1234
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:24,090
I'd taken a nine,
six,

1235
00:55:24,091 --> 00:55:28,520
four and just chopping the shit out of 
that.

1236
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:33,620
Taking 100,000
dollar car and turning it into a 

1237
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:36,231
$500,000
that if you can get on the list and get 

1238
00:55:36,231 --> 00:55:40,371
one and you take it home,
it's immediately worth $700 on the open 

1239
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:40,620
market.
I bet.

1240
00:55:40,621 --> 00:55:41,580
Right?
Because people don't want to wait.

1241
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,820
Flipper market for a singer.
It's like name your price.

1242
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,160
Name your price.
If you wanted to get a singer,

1243
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:49,620
made it.
How many years is even his waiting list?

1244
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,360
Two years.
Three years.

1245
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:53,430
So two years.
Three years for waiting list than a year

1246
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:58,431
to make the car and they're making it by
hand with carbon fiber.

1247
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:04,430
It's crazy.
I've seen the videos of people visiting 

1248
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:04,640
the factory,
putting together here.

1249
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:05,670
You should go.
I should go,

1250
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:09,260
but I'm scared.
I'll introduce you to it.

1251
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,100
I'll do it.
I'll start doing numbers in my head.

1252
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,770
It's just all this.
I mean and there's.

1253
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:16,350
And then there's a whole cut singer,
I think.

1254
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:20,670
Not to dwell on singer so much,
but they opened the door for a,

1255
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:24,010
a sub industry them that's

1256
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,950
doing $200,000,
you know,

1257
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:31,630
builds that are like halfway to singer 
for most people.

1258
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:32,710
That's probably like,
yeah,

1259
00:56:32,711 --> 00:56:34,630
that's cool.
That's really fucking excessive.

1260
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,530
Most people I bought,
you know I'm doing this safari thing,

1261
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:43,531
but I bought my 87 Carrera and its stock
and I almost didn't want to start 

1262
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:46,720
modifying it because it was just such a 
nice thing to drive around.

1263
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:52,140
It was just lovely.
Well that's recent enough where they 

1264
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,360
have like good breaks.
Yeah.

1265
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,400
And it's a super light car.
Eighties is good.

1266
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,690
I mean,
I think that the,

1267
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:00,280
what's great,
there's a,

1268
00:57:00,281 --> 00:57:03,190
there's a,
a series of shows now called Redwood.

1269
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:09,240
Yeah,
it's a car show for eighties and 

1270
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:09,240
nineties cars.
A fucking great dude.

1271
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,470
It's great because these are cars you 
can drive,

1272
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,360
you know,
they have air conditioning,

1273
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:14,640
they have reasonably,
you know,

1274
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:15,640
modern,
whatever.

1275
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,720
You could just start them up and drive 
him and do it.

1276
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:22,720
It's like old eighties benzes and,
and just just as great,

1277
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:28,050
great scene of eighties and nineties 
cars at Rad when they've got a bunch of 

1278
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,950
shows around come out and say hi.
I met a bunch of them.

1279
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:31,480
But um,
you know,

1280
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,120
people like my age,
I'm 36,

1281
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:39,121
are seeing these cars as collectible now
and it's going to usher in a new market 

1282
00:57:39,121 --> 00:57:43,680
to.
There's a lot of good investments to be 

1283
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680
made.
An eighties and nineties cars.

1284
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:46,440
Yeah.
You know what I would say.

1285
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:48,580
That's crazy.
These are good looking cars,

1286
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:50,170
dude.
There's like,

1287
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,050
this is like an 86 Acura Acura legend 
that looks mint.

1288
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,730
A buddy of mine had a,
an Acura legend just like that.

1289
00:57:57,731 --> 00:58:00,020
He loved that thing.
An 87,

1290
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:02,320
87 legend.
That's a great car.

1291
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,630
One car that I had that I wish I didn't 
get rid of.

1292
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,250
Prelude.
It's so clean.

1293
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:07,530
I had the last year.

1294
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,250
The NSX.
Oh really?

1295
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:10,290
The.
Yeah,

1296
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,120
with the headlights.
The headlights.

1297
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:16,120
You shouldn't have gotten rid of it.
Got Rid of a big dollar car right now.

1298
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:17,170
It's hot.
I don't have it.

1299
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,780
I loved it too.
That was a light ass car.

1300
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:22,650
I don't know what those things weighed.
Twenty eight,

1301
00:58:22,651 --> 00:58:23,620
28.
I'll tell you what,

1302
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:27,370
if you like that car,
that Lotus for 10 I just showed you.

1303
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,360
You would love that.
That is the new version of that car.

1304
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,090
Really?
Yup.

1305
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:33,670
I don't know if I want the new version 
though.

1306
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:36,430
I don't think I like the old version.
That's the thing.

1307
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:36,780
No,
no,

1308
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:41,790
no.
The new version feels like the old 

1309
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:43,630
version of it with like Bluetooth,
Bluetooth and your base,

1310
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:44,520
etc.
It is.

1311
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,240
Fuck.
That was a great car.

1312
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:49,450
So lIght.
They're very durable.

1313
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:50,770
You can drive them.
Yeah.

1314
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,240
People who are hot and mean.

1315
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:58,560
How did they figure it out?
so much better than the americans did 

1316
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:58,750
when it came to reliability?
Well,

1317
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:01,660
they just built a light car and then put
their accord engine in it.

1318
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:02,950
Pretty much.
Yeah,

1319
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:04,470
but I mean all oF their cars.
Oh,

1320
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:09,620
did you go through across the board,
like we were talking earlier about land 

1321
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:09,620
cruisers.
That's like god would be one of the most

1322
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,500
reliable cars.
The history of the free world.

1323
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:14,560
Like why the fuck are they so good at 
that?

1324
00:59:14,561 --> 00:59:18,070
And most companies like american 
companies during that same age,

1325
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,520
like you get a 19 nineties ford.
No,

1326
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:21,210
I know.
It's terrible.

1327
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:22,060
That's terrible

1328
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:22,720
running,
right?

1329
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:23,160
Yeah,
I know.

1330
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:26,480
But 1995 land cruiser driving through 
africa right now.

1331
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:30,680
Land cruiSers are specific or an 
interesting example specifically because

1332
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,590
I went on the press launch for land 
cruiser,

1333
00:59:32,591 --> 00:59:37,160
so I know this.
Most cars are built to a 10 year service

1334
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:42,161
life.
The land cruiser is built to a 25 year 

1335
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:45,971
service life.
The land cruisers parts are almost 100 

1336
00:59:45,971 --> 00:59:46,580
percent unique to land cruiser.
They,

1337
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:51,610
they share very few parts with anything 
else in toyota's lineup and that's why 

1338
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:51,610
you look at.
You go,

1339
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:52,760
oh,
iT's a full size suv.

1340
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:57,761
Why is this thing $90,000?
Because everything on it is industrial 

1341
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:01,610
grade shit designed to last twice as 
long as like any other car.

1342
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:03,470
Yeah,
it seems like when you drive a one,

1343
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:08,471
two tanks,
absolute absolute texts and there are 

1344
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:09,050
over engineered,
but I think in the,

1345
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:14,110
in the eighties and nineties,
I think the japanese design and 

1346
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,510
production philosophy was just so far 
beyond where we were.

1347
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,500
Yeah.
We were making shit during those years.

1348
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:25,740
Absolutely.
I mean I have an 88 mustang you just 

1349
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,601
saw.
I have an 87 porsche and I had a 1998 

1350
01:00:28,601 --> 01:00:31,670
nissan skyline gtr,
the marsha and the fucking skyline.

1351
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:35,030
Our same time,
save time period.

1352
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,860
They're spaceships compared to the hunk 
of shit that is my mustang.

1353
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:43,940
I mean those guidelines are bad ass.
Awesome.

1354
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,520
Skyline.
Yeah.

1355
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,490
Yeah.
I sold it,

1356
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:49,420
but I doubled up in six months though 
there.

1357
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,630
Think about what they did with the gtr 
when they came in.

1358
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,920
When nissan came out with the gtr,
the new,

1359
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,320
the new interest.
Onewest one.

1360
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:58,490
Dude,
I've only driven one of those twice,

1361
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,540
but one time when I drove one though,
the most remarkable thing about it was I

1362
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:06,620
was taking a turn to to hit an off ramp 
and I was like a little late.

1363
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:07,100
I was like,
oh,

1364
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:07,650
that's the law.

1365
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,130
I got to change lanes and it just went 
like this,

1366
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:11,590
cross the lanes,
zip you up,

1367
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,790
like nothing.
No lien.

1368
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:17,660
There was nothing just defied physics.
I was like,

1369
01:01:17,661 --> 01:01:19,040
this thing is crazy.
It's just,

1370
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:24,430
it's calculating how much mass is 
leaning this way and adjusting to 

1371
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:29,120
flatten everything out electronically.
So actually the new acura nsx,

1372
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:34,480
that's like the supercar you one second,
150 grand does that same thing that the 

1373
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:39,050
gtr did and oh nine,
but it does it much more seamlessly.

1374
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:44,140
So You think you did it really that 
awesome driving that just happened in 

1375
01:01:44,811 --> 01:01:45,710
the gtr.
You're like,

1376
01:01:45,711 --> 01:01:50,711
wow,
the gtr is doing all this awesome shit 

1377
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:50,711
in the nsx.
You're like,

1378
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:53,990
I'm a fucking hero because you can't 
because it's so.

1379
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,300
It's so seamless.
Like the gtr,

1380
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:57,980
it's a mechanical,
you know,

1381
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:00,560
all wheel drive system with these clutch
packs and whatever.

1382
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:02,210
So you can hear it like clunk,
clunk,

1383
01:02:02,211 --> 01:02:04,670
clunking around and like moving power 
and doing all this shit,

1384
01:02:04,671 --> 01:02:09,671
right?
The nsx is rear wheel drive gas engine 

1385
01:02:09,671 --> 01:02:11,720
and then electric motors in the front 
wheel.

1386
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,320
So it can do all kinds of funkY shit 
with the front wheels.

1387
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:18,380
The two wheels can be going completely 
different speeds from each other.

1388
01:02:18,381 --> 01:02:21,030
It's comPletely independent of what's 
happening at the back.

1389
01:02:21,031 --> 01:02:25,080
It's all this computer algorithms,
but it's magic front end,

1390
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:31,190
front end that cannot happen within the 
constraints of like normal rotational 

1391
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:33,690
physics.
Whoa dude,

1392
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:35,940
you should work for an acura.
I should sell cars.

1393
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:42,180
You got my dick hard for an nsx.
It's a good buy right now.

1394
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:47,690
People don't want them to achieve.
I don't know because they're not like 

1395
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:47,690
the old one.
Like you said,

1396
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:50,610
you want tHe old one and people wanted 
to stick and simple and it's complicated

1397
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:55,611
and.
But if people were looking for a double 

1398
01:02:55,611 --> 01:02:55,800
clutch supercar that seems to be a 
really good bargain.

1399
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:57,240
It's a great looking car.
It is.

1400
01:02:57,241 --> 01:03:00,780
I had one weekend was awesome,
awesome.

1401
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,410
And apparently the,
the power of seems very accessible,

1402
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,840
right?
Sorry,

1403
01:03:06,841 --> 01:03:08,040
I'm thirsty.
It's,

1404
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:13,270
um,
it's very forgiving and very easy to 

1405
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:13,710
drive and it makes you feel like mario 
andretti,

1406
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:18,600
hope they don't not make them anymore.
They've got to make them for a bit.

1407
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:20,700
They've committed,
but I think uh,

1408
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
you should buy one if you think you 
might like on a tinge of responsibility 

1409
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,360
when the viper went out of business and 
I never bought a viper because there's 

1410
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,060
so imposturous it's such a preposterous.

1411
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:35,630
Like I thought about getting one of 
those acrs with the wings vented hoods 

1412
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:37,890
and looked down like just for just 
because it's such a douchebag car.

1413
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:42,930
Yeah.
So if you were to list off like the 

1414
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:43,590
check boxes of things that you 
personally enjoy,

1415
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:46,430
it seems like it does actually tick most
of those boxes in there.

1416
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,350
Totally looking like a penis.
Besides that,

1417
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:52,140
it really takes the rest of the box.
It looks like godzilla is dick.

1418
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:57,170
It looks like this sort of like super 
autumn of it's very shredder,

1419
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,020
but it's so american too.
It's such a ridiculous thing to build.

1420
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:06,080
Well it's american.
What's so american about it is that 

1421
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:06,080
rather than,
you know,

1422
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:09,180
porsche developing this insane gearbox,
you know,

1423
01:04:09,181 --> 01:04:14,181
that can shift in a microsecond and,
and nissan doing this crazy fucking all 

1424
01:04:14,191 --> 01:04:19,191
wheel drive system and you know,
whoever accurate doing their torque 

1425
01:04:19,191 --> 01:04:19,191
vectoring,
electric motors,

1426
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,660
fibers,
just like more downforce,

1427
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,120
you know,
we don't know manual gearbox,

1428
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:24,330
just.

1429
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,840
Yeah,
just more downforce.

1430
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:28,080
Develop the stickiest tire.
You can find here.

1431
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:30,540
You can pop these things out and get 
even more downforce.

1432
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,550
And that's the.
That's like the whole thing.

1433
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:37,850
Yeah.
Swings just put wings on it and that'll 

1434
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:40,701
be fine,
but meanwhile they brought it to every 

1435
01:04:40,701 --> 01:04:41,120
race track and they were tracked here.
Breaking records.

1436
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:42,390
Yeah.
It's crazy.

1437
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:47,391
Yeah.
It's the most american thing ever just 

1438
01:04:47,391 --> 01:04:47,391
bought a bigger gun.
Exactly.

1439
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:51,280
The biggest 50 caliber machine gun ever.
Desert eagle.

1440
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,560
It's America.
It's big ole american dick.

1441
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:57,030
It's super America.
Yeah.

1442
01:04:57,031 --> 01:05:02,031
But then they stopped making them.
I'm sad because merca isn't necessarily 

1443
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:05,871
commercially viable.
Sometimes a come on the age of trump 

1444
01:05:05,871 --> 01:05:06,810
that they can bring it back,
bring it back.

1445
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:10,830
Vipers for everybody.
Every coal miner gets a viper,

1446
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,670
a job in a viper for every coal miner.
Right.

1447
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,490
It's the most preposterous car.
Would you agree?

1448
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:19,720
Oh,
well,

1449
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:22,840
we have Some preposterous vehicles here 
in America.

1450
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:24,390
I mean,
the fact that you can get a,

1451
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:28,420
a pickup truck version of an escalate,
it's pretty funny,

1452
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,040
you know,
do that still.

1453
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:35,740
I think they may have stopped.
I think I may have stepped on my own 

1454
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:35,740
job,
but um,

1455
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:36,100
let's see.
Preposterous.

1456
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:39,080
It's up there.
It's pretty awesome.

1457
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:44,370
Yeah.
The ford gt is pretty preposterous in a 

1458
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:44,370
very,
in a very good way.

1459
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:46,720
that's a superchArge supercar though.
It's extremely super.

1460
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,130
And that's.
is that.

1461
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:50,530
Is john [inaudible] in trouble for 
selling his?

1462
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:56,230
Don't think so.
I don't think the contract is 

1463
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:56,230
enforceable.
You don't think so?

1464
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,250
I,
I'm just going by what I've read on.

1465
01:05:57,490 --> 01:06:01,120
Tell people what the story is.
So to get one of the new ford gts,

1466
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:06,210
right?
It's what's called a homologation race 

1467
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:06,210
car.
Okay.

1468
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:10,800
So they wanted to go when the 24 hours 
of lamar in a certain class that the lmg

1469
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:15,760
t class in order to race in that class,
it has to be a street car.

1470
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:18,100
Right.
So you have to build a certain number of

1471
01:06:18,101 --> 01:06:23,101
streetcars.
you can't just build a dedicated race 

1472
01:06:23,101 --> 01:06:23,101
car that would be called the prototype 
class.

1473
01:06:23,101 --> 01:06:24,400
Okay.
So they had to build,

1474
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:28,090
I think the number is 499.
It's 400 and something for 54,

1475
01:06:28,091 --> 01:06:33,091
99,
whatever it is for decides that the 

1476
01:06:33,091 --> 01:06:34,750
demand will outstrip the supply and 
there rather than,

1477
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:40,260
you know,
highest bittering or whatever they make 

1478
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:40,260
you like apply.
So you,

1479
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:44,760
you have to be a social media star or a 
celebrity or someone you had to like 

1480
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:51,360
tell them why you should have a ford gt 
and what you were going to do with it 

1481
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,740
and how you were going to share your 
four gt with the world.

1482
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:58,741
And then they would decide that you had 
earned the right to buy their $450,000

1483
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:04,951
car.
And it came with a contract that you 

1484
01:07:04,951 --> 01:07:04,951
couldn't sell it for two years.

1485
01:07:04,951 --> 01:07:06,290
They didn't want people flipping them 
right,

1486
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:11,610
which apparently is exactly what sean's 
seen when it did seem to be so fucking 

1487
01:07:14,621 --> 01:07:15,930
rich.
Like why would,

1488
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:20,330
why would he violate the contract for a 
couple of hundred?

1489
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,400
Huge.
Really huge,

1490
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,880
very huge person or miss.
HoW huge is he?

1491
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,570
Well,
he's just enormous.

1492
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:31,100
Like with.
I bet he's probably only like six,

1493
01:07:31,101 --> 01:07:32,020
three or six.
Four,

1494
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,100
six,
four.

1495
01:07:33,101 --> 01:07:36,850
He can't fit in it.
So if he can't fit in it,

1496
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,810
that's probably why he would get rid of 
it rather than tall mr.

1497
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,930
Scene is,
but when my head hit the ceiling,

1498
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,780
that's probably exactly what he's 
probably six to at least.

1499
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:51,930
He seems like a guy who should be even 
longer and taller than he is because 

1500
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:54,580
he's so thick.
It's almost like they chopped off a foot

1501
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:57,610
of his arms and every place bought a 
giant,

1502
01:07:57,611 --> 01:07:59,860
but his risks are like fucking tree 
trunks.

1503
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:01,270
Hilarious.
Six foot 2:50.

1504
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,400
Yeah.
See he probably be close.

1505
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:05,560
It'd be close.
Six foot two or six foot.

1506
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:07,750
Six foot 250 pounds.
Oh,

1507
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:09,490
he's short of thought.
Well,

1508
01:08:09,491 --> 01:08:11,110
I don't know why he sold it,
but he did.

1509
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,270
Maybe even for him,
if it's two inches for you,

1510
01:08:13,271 --> 01:08:15,100
maybe felt squashed in there.
Look,

1511
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,260
I drove it for one day.
I don't know what it,

1512
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,840
what kind of sacrifices to buy it,
but I think he fuck like me.

1513
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:22,460
Might be a good car for you.
Good for you.

1514
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:26,120
So the seed is fixed and the pedals and 
steering wheel are adjustable.

1515
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:28,310
You can adjust the seat.
How bizarre.

1516
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,990
Yeah.
The pedals come to you.

1517
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,870
I don't think I like that.
That's what you gotta do,

1518
01:08:32,871 --> 01:08:37,871
man.
It's what you have to do because the 

1519
01:08:37,871 --> 01:08:39,230
color,
the shape of the car dictates the 

1520
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:40,730
seatback angles a bit.
Can you just make this seat slide?

1521
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,740
Put the seat on a seat?
No,

1522
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:44,180
you can't.
The car is so low.

1523
01:08:44,181 --> 01:08:47,150
You do see a seat.
Rail is like inches.

1524
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,310
Precious.
Precious inches.

1525
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:52,940
The roof is 43 inches from the ground.
that's like this.

1526
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:55,490
Whoa.
It's so low.

1527
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,520
It's that low.
It's 43 inches from the roof to roof 

1528
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:00,520
cleaning ground.
Yeah.

1529
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:03,830
Compared to all the car at one law by 
the way in the year was supposed to.

1530
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:08,920
Wow.
You park it next to a nine slash 11 and 

1531
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,190
nine slash 11 is like six inches taller 
than one of these things.

1532
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:13,590
Well that makes a really big difference 
in the 24 hours of le ma,

1533
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:16,010
you're talking 200 mile an hour straight
away.

1534
01:09:16,011 --> 01:09:17,900
Speeds.
Like that's a huge difference.

1535
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:23,320
So they've designed the car without seat
rails to get everything even further 

1536
01:09:23,511 --> 01:09:24,110
down.
You know,

1537
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:29,220
it's a dope looking car.
I saw one that was black with red 

1538
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:29,220
stripe.

1539
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,050
That was the press car was driving 
around,

1540
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:32,570
has got the same color to god.
That's a pretty car.

1541
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:34,340
it's gangster.
That's a Pretty car.

1542
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,790
Carbon fiber wheels,
which are lovely.

1543
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,250
Um,
carbon fiber wheels.

1544
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:45,251
So there's two kinds of weight in a car.
There's sprung weight and unsprung 

1545
01:09:45,251 --> 01:09:45,380
weight.
What's happening?

1546
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:50,800
So sprung weight is weight.
That is most of what you think of as the

1547
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:52,700
car,
the engine,

1548
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:57,790
the body.
AnYthing that has sprung on the 

1549
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:57,950
suspension,
unsprung weight,

1550
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,590
his weight on the car that is not sprung
on the suspension.

1551
01:10:00,591 --> 01:10:02,420
So wheels,
brake,

1552
01:10:02,421 --> 01:10:03,800
rotors,
tires,

1553
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:08,390
suspension components that aren't 
sItting on the suspension.

1554
01:10:08,391 --> 01:10:11,630
Right?
So it's like a rough calculation,

1555
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:16,810
but like roughly one pound of unsprung 
weight will translate the feeling of 

1556
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:24,550
five pounds of tongue weight.
So meaning like if you are able to pull 

1557
01:10:24,561 --> 01:10:27,320
20 pounds of unsprung weight out of your
car,

1558
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:31,610
each wheel is four pounds or five pounds
lighter than a stock.

1559
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:32,210
We'll.
Okay.

1560
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,330
So you're not about 20 pounds unsprung 
weight to your car.

1561
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:39,530
YOur car will feel like you pulled 100 
pounds out of it and it will stop,

1562
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:40,880
start,
accelerate,

1563
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:44,470
turn better commute.
Uh,

1564
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,870
a totally in all our,
it'll perform better in all areas.

1565
01:10:47,871 --> 01:10:52,871
So to go from a forged aluminum wheel,
which is 23 or 24 or 25 pounds a wheel 

1566
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:00,320
to a carbon fiber wheel,
that's like 11 pounds a wheel,

1567
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:05,910
you,
you're pulling so much unsprung weight 

1568
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:05,910
out of the car,
it'll feel like,

1569
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:07,520
you know,
swinging a baseball bat with a weight on

1570
01:11:07,521 --> 01:11:09,650
it and then just throw in that weight 
away.

1571
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,850
Wow.
Yeah.

1572
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,320
Massive,
massive,

1573
01:11:12,321 --> 01:11:13,070
massive,
massive,

1574
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,510
massive difference.
And the wheels are so expense,

1575
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:20,690
I would imagine like how many companies 
make carbon fiber wheel one wine called 

1576
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:26,340
carbon revolution and they're from 
Australia and those are the only make 

1577
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:26,340
them for the four days.

1578
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:31,010
You can buy the wheels.
They have fitments for a few different 

1579
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:34,041
cars.
Porsche gt three is one and they make 

1580
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:36,630
them for ford.
Will you do me a favor jamie and pull up

1581
01:11:36,631 --> 01:11:40,740
the photo of that black ford gt with the
red stripes?

1582
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,320
It's on my instagram.
If you have my instagram handy,

1583
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:47,190
the one I drove up,
I'm incredibly.

1584
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:52,200
The road presence is just seen and it 
makes noises that only god damn it makes

1585
01:11:55,921 --> 01:12:00,921
noises that only race cars make.
There's a specific sound like you know 

1586
01:12:00,921 --> 01:12:04,140
the pops and crackles you get from most 
of these modern cars and they dumped the

1587
01:12:04,141 --> 01:12:06,840
fuel in the exhaust and shit and it's 
cool.

1588
01:12:06,841 --> 01:12:09,880
But it's a synthetic eee sound.
It's programmed right?

1589
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:13,620
This does that.
Not programmed.

1590
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:17,250
It's just like fuel into header.
Bang.

1591
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:18,850
It's just.
Sorry.

1592
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:22,530
Scars.
And this goes for like $500,000

1593
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:27,830
for 50.
If you can get one but you can't get 

1594
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:27,930
what you can't get unless you know 
johnson and then the route.

1595
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,960
I mean the rumor is he got like over a 
million for his butt.

1596
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,460
Oh,
so somebody ordered off.

1597
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,530
Well that makes sense.
Flipped it and flipped it.

1598
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,260
And so they're suing him.
Yeah,

1599
01:12:37,261 --> 01:12:39,540
I,
I read that it was thrown out.

1600
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:42,000
They sued them for breach of contract,
for selling it,

1601
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:47,420
but he,
he claims or claimed that the contract 

1602
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:48,720
didn't say he couldn't sell it.
Oh.

1603
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,970
So it was a verbal agreement or 
something?

1604
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:55,971
I don't know.
Maybe it was one of those things they 

1605
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:56,370
just hoped nobody would call him out on 
and maybe it's unenforceable.

1606
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:56,900
You know what I mean?
How,

1607
01:12:56,910 --> 01:13:01,910
how do they sell you something and then 
enforced that you can't sell the thing 

1608
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:01,910
you bought.
You can't do that.

1609
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,750
You really,
you literally can't do that.

1610
01:13:03,751 --> 01:13:08,751
I don't think that's enforceable.
I think once the contract is signed in 

1611
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:10,170
and you take possession of this object,
that's yours to do whatever you want,

1612
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:11,670
I think it's morally.

1613
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:16,670
I compare american moTherfucker,
but for fucking hats off.

1614
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:19,260
You made a dope ass car.
That thing's amazing.

1615
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:21,810
It's extremely,
extremely crazy.

1616
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,920
it really in it,
it's,

1617
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:27,630
it's unlike anythinG else on the road 
because even even the,

1618
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:29,130
um,
the very,

1619
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:30,840
very high end super cars,
you know,

1620
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:35,841
your lamborghini aventador is that are 
400 grand and you're v12 ferrari's and 

1621
01:13:35,841 --> 01:13:39,180
all that stuff are fundamentally they're
road cars and even when you,

1622
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:44,181
they go racing with them,
they sort of take the road car and 

1623
01:13:44,181 --> 01:13:47,500
modify it for racing.
This is so clearly a race car that they 

1624
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,000
had to build some street cars,
you know,

1625
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:55,140
and I'm fucking rocking.
It looks amazing.

1626
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,110
It's got an air brake on him.
The active.

1627
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:00,060
So the go back to the rear picture.
Yeah.

1628
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:02,580
So the wing,
the whole wing that,

1629
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:07,610
that whole wing that goes across the 
back there lifts up when you hit the 

1630
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:07,610
brakes.

1631
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,390
Well it lifts.
When you start driving quick,

1632
01:14:09,391 --> 01:14:14,391
it lifts up and becomes a wing wing.
And then when you hit the brakes it 

1633
01:14:14,391 --> 01:14:15,520
flips up and becomes a,
an actual airbrake.

1634
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:18,790
And it is extremely effective,
I would imagine.

1635
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,920
What it does is it know when you break 
the car,

1636
01:14:20,921 --> 01:14:23,740
nose dives,
it completely eliminates the dive.

1637
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:26,530
So the car just squats straight down.
Wow.

1638
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,690
That's wild.
It's fucking gorgeous.

1639
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,410
Are they going to keep making them?
I don't.

1640
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:34,270
I don't think so.
Why not?

1641
01:14:34,271 --> 01:14:35,800
Ford?
I fired to guest.

1642
01:14:35,801 --> 01:14:37,420
They lose money on every single one they
make.

1643
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:41,060
If I had to guess,
kind of a bullshit word.

1644
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:42,850
We run in here.
I know trump.

1645
01:14:42,851 --> 01:14:46,810
I thought you were going to fix all this
thought that was part of your platform.

1646
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:50,650
That's what I heard.
It's going to make american great again.

1647
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:55,450
Do we?
The car economy is.

1648
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:59,380
It's such a global economy like 
american,

1649
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:01,690
like we make a bunch of the hell.
Cats are built.

1650
01:15:01,691 --> 01:15:06,691
Like in Canada.
We make bmw x five in south caroLina.

1651
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:11,230
Well,
we make up ford tundras in Texas.

1652
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:13,150
That's what toyota tundra.
Toyota tundra.

1653
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:16,810
Toyota is a make a couple different cars
here in America.

1654
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:22,660
A couple of cars in America.
I think japanese automakers probably 

1655
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:25,360
have at least as many auto workers in 
America as american car companies do.

1656
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:28,800
This is definitely the same car I was 
driving press cars.

1657
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:31,060
God,
what is great is just the.

1658
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:36,070
The buttresses like when it goes by,
you can see right through the side of 

1659
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:39,931
the car.
you can just see the air there between 

1660
01:15:39,931 --> 01:15:39,931
the tunnel and the pod.
That's so pretty.

1661
01:15:39,931 --> 01:15:44,431
Yeah.
That might be the best looking car I've 

1662
01:15:44,431 --> 01:15:44,740
ever seen.
It is so cool.

1663
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:47,620
It was so fast.
As far as like american cars,

1664
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,290
that literally might be the best looking
car I've ever seen.

1665
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,330
I think if it's my money I want.
I would buy the older gt,

1666
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:58,660
the 2005 one because I liked the manual 
transmission.

1667
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,240
Sure.
And I just think it was.

1668
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:03,070
that was just one of the best cars ever 
made.

1669
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:04,300
Do you ever drive one of those?
YeAh.

1670
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,650
What's that like?
The best?

1671
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,580
Really?
The best,

1672
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,270
best?
Best?

1673
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:08,860
Yeah.
Because this is a race car,

1674
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,510
right?
And,

1675
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:12,220
and everything that comes with it,
that one,

1676
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:16,840
it was a road car and it was let's make 
the best road car we can make.

1677
01:16:16,841 --> 01:16:19,390
And so it wasn't a particularly 
successful race car,

1678
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:24,190
but as a road car it was just glorious.
The ride and the power and the style and

1679
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:26,020
the sound and you know,
it's,

1680
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:28,240
they had to develop that car very 
quickly.

1681
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:33,270
I think the last time I was on this show
we were talking about for gts and you 

1682
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:33,660
know,
so everything's overbuilt.

1683
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:38,710
You can run like double stock horse 
power and you can run almost 280 miles 

1684
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:42,220
an hour in the fucking mile and these 
things on stock arrow and when people do

1685
01:16:42,221 --> 01:16:44,740
crAzy shit with them,
like put twin turbos in them and stuff,

1686
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,630
I should not even that crazy.
It's expensive,

1687
01:16:46,631 --> 01:16:49,210
but it's,
it's proven science at this point.

1688
01:16:49,211 --> 01:16:50,680
They're not breaking any new ground.
Yeah.

1689
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:51,710
Wow.
It's,

1690
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,980
it's actually because they're super 
supercharged from the factory.

1691
01:16:53,981 --> 01:16:58,981
Right.
So they're meant to handle forced 

1692
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,601
induction.
So the turbo system you take off the 

1693
01:17:00,601 --> 01:17:02,260
supercharger in the turbo system,
supplants it.

1694
01:17:02,261 --> 01:17:03,310
Is that the right word?
I don't know.

1695
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:06,310
It's just,
it runs more boost,

1696
01:17:06,311 --> 01:17:08,530
but it's a very,
very strong engine.

1697
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:10,070
And so they're

1698
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,740
not completely different systems.
They just,

1699
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,350
they both force air in,
just they do it in different ways.

1700
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:18,380
And when you buy one from the factory,
how many horsepower did he come with?

1701
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:20,420
Five 55.
Fifty is a lot back then.

1702
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:21,110
That's a bunch.
Yeah.

1703
01:17:21,111 --> 01:17:24,170
With no traction control.
That was the last last car.

1704
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:28,670
The viper to the same year.
Viber might've had one year,

1705
01:17:28,671 --> 01:17:30,770
but basically the last car without 
traction.

1706
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:32,450
Control,
stability control.

1707
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:33,590
Yeah.
So a lot of people would,

1708
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,570
would crash them.
Oh yeah,

1709
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:36,560
I would imagine.
Yeah.

1710
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:40,280
My gt three doesn't have shit on it.
It has.

1711
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,520
Yeah.
It has um,

1712
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:43,550
control and that kind of thing.
So no,

1713
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:48,640
it has antilock brakes.
I don't think it has traction control 

1714
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:52,470
hit really.
I think the next model did because it's 

1715
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:52,470
the rs,
huh?

1716
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:54,290
I don't know how fortunate for you if it
doesn't,

1717
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:55,400
it's a very raw car.

1718
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,550
I loved your car out of a lot of fun.
Driving your car to fun cars,

1719
01:17:58,551 --> 01:17:59,420
man.
That's great.

1720
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:04,540
I think maybe the next.
Maybe the next thing I buy my bnrs 

1721
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:05,390
they're great.
I know they're getting so expensive.

1722
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:08,510
I know,
but safe money thousand seven.

1723
01:18:08,511 --> 01:18:10,250
Year two is like,
that's the year.

1724
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:14,070
The one aFterwards they became,
they started having traction control.

1725
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:16,370
Make sure that's true.
I'm pretty sure it's true.

1726
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,520
Two thousand seven gt,
three rs.

1727
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:24,521
No traction control.
I'm pretty sure there is a period of 

1728
01:18:24,521 --> 01:18:27,760
2000 early two thousands up to an end of
two thousands where portia was using the

1729
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:32,660
engine called the metzker engine,
whIch,

1730
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:35,720
which traced its way back to the mall 
and it was a very,

1731
01:18:35,721 --> 01:18:39,140
very strong engine.
Almost say that would give me correctly.

1732
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:43,000
Let me se le mans le mans,
the movIe with steve mcqueen.

1733
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,230
Fucking hate.
That movie really stinks.

1734
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:48,380
Does it?
Steve mcqueen movies stink.

1735
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,210
Wow.
You are a crazy person.

1736
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:54,560
How dare you.
I liked the image of steve mcqueen.

1737
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:59,680
I like what he represents.
This a broody american from the 19 

1738
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:01,320
sixties.
You know,

1739
01:19:01,321 --> 01:19:03,500
like one of the last of the real men.
Yeah,

1740
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:06,320
I mean I liked steve mcqueen based on 
the photographs of him.

1741
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:11,321
I've seen his movies.
Like I thought it was interesting 

1742
01:19:11,321 --> 01:19:13,610
because it was like a snapshot of time.
Like um,

1743
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,780
what's the other one?
Oh,

1744
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,910
bullet bullet bullets.
interesting.

1745
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:19,910
It's like you're,
you're looking at a snapshot in time,

1746
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:21,770
you know,
it's just weird.

1747
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,210
San francisco,
san francisco,

1748
01:19:23,211 --> 01:19:26,000
so empty and pull it.
There was nobody alive back then.

1749
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,660
People.
There was no tech companies.

1750
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:31,450
There's very few people.
Chat.

1751
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:36,700
Traffic was nothing back then.
Men talk to somebody about what traffic 

1752
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:37,670
is like in 1960 and la when the guy just
brought that up earlier,

1753
01:19:37,671 --> 01:19:38,150
this show.

1754
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:43,390
Well,
I moved here in [inaudible] 94 and I 

1755
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:43,390
remember when I moved here it was 
nothing like this.

1756
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:45,650
really nothing.
It's gotten 100 percent worse.

1757
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:49,490
it's like just twice as many people here
it is what it feels like us,

1758
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:51,020
it's,
it's so crazy.

1759
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:55,190
Like you get on the highway on a 
saturday night just heading into la on a

1760
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:58,580
saturday night and you're stuck in 
bumper to bumper traffic for no reason.

1761
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,710
No one's dead.
There's no accident.

1762
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:02,640
It's just.
I read,

1763
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,730
I'm reading a book right now called 
traffic.

1764
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:07,010
It's about the science of traffic and 
it.

1765
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:08,250
They did a study in la

1766
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,810
and saturday,
2:00

1767
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:13,410
PM traffic is worse than any weekday day
rush hour in los.

1768
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:16,050
Everybody's out,
everyone's out doing their shit.

1769
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,390
Dude.
You know when you go to another city,

1770
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:21,360
like if you go to a big city like 
seattle and you're like,

1771
01:20:21,361 --> 01:20:23,490
you're there with them and they complain
about the traffic,

1772
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:26,730
go shut the fuck up.
Second of all,

1773
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:32,510
what I'm doing must be wrong then 
because I'm dealing with way too many 

1774
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:33,420
people.
You guys have got it right.

1775
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:35,790
This is the right amount.
You got a lot of people,

1776
01:20:35,791 --> 01:20:39,000
but enough to many people,
I get a medium sized city that's not la.

1777
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:39,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

1778
01:20:39,481 --> 01:20:41,340
And in traffic makes sense.
It goes in,

1779
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,290
it goes out.
Yeah.

1780
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:44,580
Like here,
it's just like the.

1781
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:48,740
Hence the scooter you want to get out 
before it gets all blade runner.

1782
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,780
He.
When's that gonna happen?

1783
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:52,470
Well,
You know,

1784
01:20:52,471 --> 01:20:55,940
it's like those dudes like magnus walker
lived in downtown la.

1785
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:59,700
It was dreadlocks in his garage 
warehouse district.

1786
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:01,290
Those guys like that shit.
Right?

1787
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:03,480
He likes that.
She likes being an urbanite.

1788
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,190
I'm super fucked.
I'm in venice.

1789
01:21:05,191 --> 01:21:07,620
When that tsunami comes,
I'm super fall.

1790
01:21:07,621 --> 01:21:08,790
Yeah,
you're right on the edge.

1791
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:14,100
It's not good for me not looking good.
All the cars had done will be on my 

1792
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:18,411
room.
App was the app that wants to give us 

1793
01:21:18,411 --> 01:21:20,601
access to early warning app says you 
have 60 seconds for your fucking day 

1794
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:22,890
Because that I had in Hawaii.
Well,

1795
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:23,400
yeah,
there's a,

1796
01:21:23,401 --> 01:21:26,460
there's an app now that's working in 
California,

1797
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:28,890
but it's the,
you're about to die.

1798
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,840
It's,
it's an earthquake's about to hit.

1799
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:34,560
They apparently have it depending upon 
the magnitude,

1800
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:37,110
the earthquake,
which is really scary because the higher

1801
01:21:37,111 --> 01:21:39,780
magnitude possibility the more time you 
have.

1802
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:44,880
So they really can give you up to a 
minute to know your foxville dude.

1803
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:48,690
I'm just thinking what can I.
I'm thinking about one in a minute.

1804
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,120
Nowhere.
Nowhere worth getting.

1805
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:55,260
I can get to like my closet.
Do you have stored food or anything?

1806
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:59,120
I'm embarrassed that I don't have a List
of shit I need for.

1807
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:01,140
Probably should probably get for an 
earthquake,

1808
01:22:01,141 --> 01:22:06,141
but I don't know.
You must have a whole room of shit in 

1809
01:22:06,141 --> 01:22:07,680
this fuCking policy rather than here.
But here I have meat in here,

1810
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:10,830
but I have um,
I do have commercial freezers,

1811
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:13,380
courts for ell,
for elk,

1812
01:22:13,381 --> 01:22:13,940
right?
Yeah.

1813
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,540
But um,
I have,

1814
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,280
um,
emergency rations,

1815
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:22,080
have a freeze dried food and you know,
that could last me a few months.

1816
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,370
How would you,
like,

1817
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:25,560
how would you physically get out of the 
city?

1818
01:22:26,330 --> 01:22:29,070
You would really be fucked.
You says you just start walking.

1819
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:32,430
Bicycle wheel.
The real fuck would be cars.

1820
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:33,820
Too many cars,
right?

1821
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,840
There's way too many cars for you ever 
see what happened when the hurricanes 

1822
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:38,840
were hitting Texas?

1823
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:40,620
People try to escape,
or Florida,

1824
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:41,850
like Florida,
the last one.

1825
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,000
You can't go anywhere and they just get 
stuck on the highway and you run out of 

1826
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:47,310
gas and the highwAys.
Nobody's scared and desperate.

1827
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:51,360
It's not good in hurricanes.
You see comment,

1828
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:54,270
this earthquake get 30 seconds,
you know,

1829
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,920
I think my scooter is the is what's 
going to save me?

1830
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:00,200
It's going to be.
They're going to go,

1831
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:01,490
you're going to go somewhere.
They're going to beat you.

1832
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,730
Gonna get away with a bunch of.
Yeah.

1833
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:10,860
Yeah.
They're going to hunt you down and put 

1834
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:10,860
me on a spit.
Yeah.

1835
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:13,740
They going to keep you alive so they 
could eat you longer because there's no 

1836
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:13,740
refrigeration.
Refrigeration is going to tie you up and

1837
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,120
cut off parts of you eat it in front of 
you.

1838
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:18,770
They come here and bust into this 
fucking place.

1839
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:19,870
Yeah,
I mean that's the move.

1840
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:22,500
Come here.
we'll help you both.

1841
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:23,320
This space.
Dude,

1842
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:26,680
who has a fLoat tank.
That is so awesome.

1843
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,780
Everybody should have one.
I agree.

1844
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,010
I just.
My.

1845
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:33,730
My real concern is the,
just that the mass of humans,

1846
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:38,380
just the sheer number is so insane and I
don't think it's.

1847
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:42,190
I don't think it's sustainable like this
number of people that are.

1848
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:47,640
There's never been a time ever in human 
history where we've had masses of people

1849
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:52,330
crammed into areas like we have today in
our urban areas.

1850
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:57,331
You mean modern America?
Modern Mexico city is like that jammed 

1851
01:23:57,331 --> 01:23:58,690
up.
There's quite a few places that are like

1852
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,930
the population numbers higher now than 
it's ever been recorded.

1853
01:24:01,931 --> 01:24:06,931
Human history and so the population in 
these cities is higher than it's ever 

1854
01:24:06,931 --> 01:24:06,931
been.
We've never had,

1855
01:24:06,931 --> 01:24:09,010
like matt,
we never had 20 million people in a city

1856
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:11,140
before in America like we do in la.

1857
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:16,120
Was that jamie stay through the smaller 
population than los angeles county?

1858
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:20,260
Is that all of them on the full 30 
something states?

1859
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:23,110
Almost all of them is la county.
Twenty dollars million people yet.

1860
01:24:23,111 --> 01:24:24,540
It's like 16 something,
right?

1861
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:29,700
I think of it.
This is like on the 10 to 11 million 

1862
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,810
units,
so looking at this map and it's one tiny

1863
01:24:31,811 --> 01:24:35,530
little area of California and it has 
more people in it.

1864
01:24:35,531 --> 01:24:40,531
If it was a state than almost every 
fucking state except Florida that in 

1865
01:24:40,531 --> 01:24:41,150
Texas,
Texas,

1866
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,400
New York,
Pennsylvania,

1867
01:24:42,401 --> 01:24:44,800
Ohio,
and given me Illinois,

1868
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:46,340
Illinois.
God damn.

1869
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:49,300
That is just fucking banana leaves.
So crazy.

1870
01:24:49,301 --> 01:24:54,301
I don't.
Is it where would you if you didn't 

1871
01:24:54,301 --> 01:24:54,301
live?
No,

1872
01:24:54,301 --> 01:24:54,301
if I didn't live.
No.

1873
01:24:54,301 --> 01:24:55,750
So where would you live if you didn't 
live here?

1874
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,590
I've probably like,
I like Colorado a lot.

1875
01:24:59,591 --> 01:25:01,630
Colorado's gets state.
Mountains are good.

1876
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:07,160
I like noise.
I like northern California but not san 

1877
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:07,160
francisco.

1878
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:10,790
Like farmers get fucked up.
Deal with that weird dude.

1879
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:12,620
It keeps knocking on your door.
Yeah.

1880
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,980
New woods.
Um,

1881
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:17,450
Colorado.
I think I like Utah too.

1882
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:19,660
I like Utah.
Utah's very underrated.

1883
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,730
Those people are very nice.
They think everybody thinks you tell.

1884
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,130
Go fucking mormons.
I can't do it.

1885
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:27,040
Mormons are friendly.
Some of the nicest folks ever.

1886
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,920
I spent like four months in st george 
was that.

1887
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:34,980
It's the very corner southwest corner of
Utah at the Arizona Nevada corner and 

1888
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:40,540
it's like the,
the town nearest to zion national park.

1889
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:43,950
I was doing like landscape photography 
for awhiLe that,

1890
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,750
that's gorgeous science.
Awesome.

1891
01:25:46,751 --> 01:25:49,750
It's so pretty.
And aCtually to bring it back to cars.

1892
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:52,480
um,
we had a show at nbc sports called drive

1893
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:57,530
and did a national parks.
The roads through our national parks 

1894
01:25:57,530 --> 01:25:57,850
here in America.
Our glorious,

1895
01:25:57,851 --> 01:26:00,880
glorious yellow,
yosemIte zion,

1896
01:26:00,881 --> 01:26:03,680
death valley,
bryce canyon.

1897
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:04,100
All

1898
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,200
have amazing roads going through them.
Yeah.

1899
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:11,120
And just the view that you get.
We're very lucky here.

1900
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:16,330
We've got a lot of cool shit.
And in California we got the best roads 

1901
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:16,550
in America.
Possibly.

1902
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,580
We've got soMe pretty good ones.
You know,

1903
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:23,600
that.
Just that place where everybody goes to 

1904
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:23,600
just to drive to fuck around that 
angel's crest highway.

1905
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:24,560
God,
that's pretty.

1906
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:26,390
That's where I was this morning before I
came here.

1907
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:30,350
What were you driving up there?
My focus rs was having fun,

1908
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:33,500
we adjusted the suspension and so I 
needed to shake it down.

1909
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:37,010
Those are fast little cars very fast.
I worked with mountain on mine.

1910
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:42,320
Um,
so it's making 377 wheel horsepower and 

1911
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,990
455.
We'll torque from a four cylinder and we

1912
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:49,520
have a adapt kw,
ddc adaptive suspension,

1913
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:51,680
adaptive coil overs.
That's hilarious.

1914
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:53,240
Awesome.
The cars very,

1915
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:58,241
very fast right now.
And that's a really like cartoon right 

1916
01:26:58,241 --> 01:26:58,241
now that's not so light.

1917
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:02,950
It's small but it's all wheel drive 
which adds to the weight and so it's a,

1918
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:06,140
it's not super heavy,
but it's not a,

1919
01:27:06,141 --> 01:27:08,710
it's not a featherweight porsche or 
something like that.

1920
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:10,610
And a liTtle less maybe 33,
34,

1921
01:27:10,611 --> 01:27:15,611
but it's a,
it's got a Lot of stick and porsChe at 

1922
01:27:15,611 --> 01:27:19,180
porsche.
Fuck me for the irs has this trick all 

1923
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:21,800
wheel drive system.
You can actually power oversteer.

1924
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:25,730
So it's not like when the front wheel 
slip you get power to the back.

1925
01:27:25,731 --> 01:27:28,160
Like it has a,
what they call it drift mode,

1926
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,790
which can send up to 100 percent of the 
power to the back.

1927
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:34,940
So you've been wanting you to get crazy.
You can actually,

1928
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:40,080
yeah.
Oversteer and of engineered craziness 

1929
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,060
and wow.
the new and the new m five,

1930
01:27:41,061 --> 01:27:43,370
you know,
is all wheel drive in the new amg.

1931
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:48,720
Sixty three is all wheel drive and you 
can electronically disconnect the all 

1932
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:48,720
wheel.

1933
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,790
Drive through a button in both of them.
Yeah.

1934
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:54,320
So you can get drifting as well.
Get drifting.

1935
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:55,180
Mr.
Harris.

1936
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,630
Yeah.
Wanting to get drifting.

1937
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:57,670
Whatever.
yeah.

1938
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,120
What do you think of that new cadillac?
What is it?

1939
01:28:01,121 --> 01:28:02,900
The a six.
Oh,

1940
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:05,540
was the ct six with the super cruise?
That thing?

1941
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:09,500
It's the new big cadillac that has a 
giant engine in it now.

1942
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,590
Oh,
it's a putting a 600 horsepower engine.

1943
01:28:12,591 --> 01:28:16,160
What is that thing called?
Ct six v c sat.

1944
01:28:16,161 --> 01:28:16,910
What it is.
I don't.

1945
01:28:16,911 --> 01:28:18,590
I'm going to say the wrong thing.
I haven't.

1946
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:21,460
I saw this thing.
Got me excited about cadillacs.

1947
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:24,140
Well,
there's a ctsv no,

1948
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:26,020
not that one.
it's the ccc.

1949
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:29,600
I think it's called the ctcs.
Ct six is their biggest one.

1950
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:33,650
It's the brand new.
The brand new one has a crazy v engine.

1951
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:35,450
I don't think it has.
No,

1952
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:36,680
no,
it's not for sale yet.

1953
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:40,010
IT has a twin turbo like dual overhead 
cam v eight,

1954
01:28:40,011 --> 01:28:45,011
which is like the most advanced general 
motors engine ever and it's going to be 

1955
01:28:45,011 --> 01:28:48,350
a cadillac exclusive engine,
which hasn't happened since.

1956
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:51,090
remember the north star?
That was the last time kat.

1957
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:56,091
He got their own motors.
Make it a big deal about it being 

1958
01:28:56,091 --> 01:28:56,091
cadillac exclusive for k comerica.
Go fuck yourself.

1959
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:01,370
That's sort of what cadillac hasn't had 
right is right.

1960
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:06,500
You know the cadillac,
like they actually the ctsv is the 

1961
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:10,581
lightest,
fastest car in its class that as the 

1962
01:29:10,581 --> 01:29:10,680
best steering in its class as the most 
horsepower in his class,

1963
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:15,800
so making little not sell them.
What they can't sell ctsv is they can't 

1964
01:29:15,841 --> 01:29:20,841
sell ats fees.
Like what do you mean no one's buying 

1965
01:29:20,841 --> 01:29:20,841
those?
Well,

1966
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,600
I mean I'm sure there's a few reasons,
but the,

1967
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:28,700
the infotainment system,
that queue system is really pretty 

1968
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:28,700
terrible.

1969
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:32,900
Fat dick.
A lot of people don't make it to the 

1970
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:32,900
test drive because of that.
Yeah.

1971
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,380
That,
that thing is really like a liability is

1972
01:29:34,381 --> 01:29:35,760
not good.
It's very bad.

1973
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:40,850
I've tried to like I was,
I rented an escalate and I was going 

1974
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:40,850
through all that shit to try to get to 
the navigation.

1975
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:43,980
Like what the fuck man?
The toughest bars forever.

1976
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:45,920
I'm good at this.
I can't figure it out.

1977
01:29:45,921 --> 01:29:47,250
How to get the navigation.
Where do you.

1978
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,260
Where's home?
Where's the fucking home button?

1979
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:54,650
So that that's why.
Are they switching over to car play now 

1980
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:57,610
or worse than the android or apple 
phone?

1981
01:29:57,611 --> 01:29:58,530
Yeah.
You can get those.

1982
01:29:58,531 --> 01:29:59,820
Yeah.
That's still.

1983
01:29:59,821 --> 01:30:04,821
That still doesn't get you around the 
touch buttons and stuff and that he is 

1984
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:08,810
the cta cta to fucking slam.
I mean if that actually artist's 

1985
01:30:10,441 --> 01:30:12,820
rendering on boy,
that's what.

1986
01:30:12,821 --> 01:30:13,370
It's really good.

1987
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:18,410
That's the ct six if it looks like that 
will say cadillac has a really nice 

1988
01:30:18,661 --> 01:30:23,640
history of coming out with very bold 
concept cars and then not building them.

1989
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:24,360
Oh,
come on.

1990
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:29,930
Seriously make that.
They have they build end up building 

1991
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:29,970
water down shit for every floor.
Does it to.

1992
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:35,240
Cadillac was always the car.
Like my grandfather's day made it.

1993
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:41,330
You got a fucking cat.
I can put that back up for a second 

1994
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:43,851
please.
That thing to me looks like a modern 

1995
01:30:43,851 --> 01:30:46,740
version of what I felt like a cadillac 
should be.

1996
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:49,950
Well that's not entirely different from 
a bentley flying spur.

1997
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:53,010
If you pull up a bentley flying spur 
that looks similar,

1998
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:58,190
but that again is a rendering.
That's the best look in catalogs 

1999
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:03,320
rendering like they.
I hope they make that way because that 

2000
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,020
is the best look and cadillac I've ever 
seen.

2001
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,780
It's aggressive,
I mean aggressive for american cars.

2002
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:11,040
Aggressive cells,
right chrysler 300 saved chrysler.

2003
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:16,100
And when I say best looking cadillac,
I mean best looking new cadillac.

2004
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:21,680
That's what I mean.
I don't mean like the batmobile style 

2005
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:24,800
old school catalogs because I really 
feel it's unfair to compare because the 

2006
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,040
details,
those are works of art.

2007
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,260
Yeah,
I mean like what year would that be?

2008
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:33,290
Like a 57.
Eldorado would be retail custom.

2009
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,740
Fifty seven,
you know,

2010
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:40,140
and they're like 75 feet long.
Big bodies are coming up big.

2011
01:31:40,141 --> 01:31:43,470
So the,
the slammed on bags,

2012
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:45,690
you know,
with steel wheels.

2013
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,130
Yeah.
So there's your fins.

2014
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:50,970
Look at that.
Jesus christ as a chopped roof.

2015
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:52,800
Oh my god.
That one.

2016
01:31:52,801 --> 01:31:55,740
They've really gone batmobile.
That looks like a bat.

2017
01:31:55,890 --> 01:31:56,770
Yeah.
God,

2018
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:58,440
it's beautiful though,
but fit man.

2019
01:31:58,441 --> 01:32:00,190
I wish you can't bring fins back,

2020
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:03,250
but that would be nice.
Yesterday and impact and all.

2021
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:05,260
Yeah,
that is hot.

2022
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:09,100
That's older.
That's like a 55,

2023
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,620
maybe seven.
That's a custom job.

2024
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:14,800
The bill.
But you know,

2025
01:32:14,801 --> 01:32:17,740
do you.
Would you roll big body like that?

2026
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:18,710
You have full,
big bought.

2027
01:32:18,711 --> 01:32:21,930
I mean you would take it out on sunday 
and then you'd go fuck this car and then

2028
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:26,970
you would drive something that you can 
actually drive because part of the 

2029
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:28,240
thrill of driving is the interaction 
with the road.

2030
01:32:28,241 --> 01:32:33,241
Right.
And like those cars are not interacting 

2031
01:32:33,241 --> 01:32:33,241
very well.
Know there's so much weight.

2032
01:32:33,241 --> 01:32:34,390
You're moving them around.
They're sloppy.

2033
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:38,620
Whereas like you got into like an old 73
porsche.

2034
01:32:38,621 --> 01:32:40,620
You could drive that thing.
Yes.

2035
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:44,170
Even like stock from the factory.
You could drive that thing.

2036
01:32:44,171 --> 01:32:45,350
No problem.
Yeah.

2037
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,040
The american car,
the older american cars,

2038
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:50,920
like you have no idea where that limit 
is coming.

2039
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,450
It's like I'm there,
I'm there,

2040
01:32:52,451 --> 01:32:54,850
I'm there.
The wheels falling off trees.

2041
01:32:55,490 --> 01:32:56,260
Ooh.
Yeah.

2042
01:32:56,261 --> 01:32:58,120
They're just.
There was no communication,

2043
01:32:58,121 --> 01:32:59,960
the steering wheel,
old school,

2044
01:32:59,961 --> 01:33:04,961
electric steering is like a terrible 
zero communication up and I used to be 

2045
01:33:04,961 --> 01:33:07,510
so afraid of old cars and then I started
driving old european cars knowing,

2046
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:11,290
oh,
this is how this is supposed to go.

2047
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:12,670
It's just America.
Well,

2048
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:14,350
it's a product of their environment,
right?

2049
01:33:14,351 --> 01:33:19,090
Like in the eighties,
those fucking gem guys that chomp cigars

2050
01:33:19,091 --> 01:33:23,950
and they're off the rack shitty suits.
They never left detroit and if you go to

2051
01:33:23,951 --> 01:33:27,340
detroit it's just fucking pot holes and 
it's straight lines.

2052
01:33:27,341 --> 01:33:30,280
And so of course the cars would ride 
like shit and,

2053
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:35,340
or would float around and not handle 
because there isn't a corner for 300 

2054
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:36,370
miles,
you know,

2055
01:33:36,371 --> 01:33:41,371
now you get the ctsv because these guys 
and they go to the nurburgring and 

2056
01:33:41,371 --> 01:33:41,371
tests.

2057
01:33:41,371 --> 01:33:44,080
It's a global world now.
Yeah,

2058
01:33:44,081 --> 01:33:45,670
it's a totally different.
And then detroit,

2059
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:50,940
these,
these closed minded morons built cars 

2060
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:53,971
for their own city and sold them all 
over the world with no regard to the 

2061
01:33:54,191 --> 01:33:59,080
fact that they didn't work for shit in 
Italy or anywhere with corners in it.

2062
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:01,000
You know?
That's interesting.

2063
01:34:01,001 --> 01:34:02,920
That's a good point.
And it's set up America,

2064
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:07,090
those you go drive a 57 cadillac in 
detroit and you go,

2065
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:08,890
well this makes all the sense in the 
world.

2066
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:11,680
The roads are straight.
Nineteen 57.

2067
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,980
How's that beeline coffee?
This is your coffee.

2068
01:34:14,981 --> 01:34:16,180
Yeah,
this is really good.

2069
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,100
It's good,
don't you,

2070
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:18,130
you,
you.

2071
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:20,050
Did you go to the place where they know 
it?

2072
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:22,390
I work with this company,
beeline coffee.

2073
01:34:22,391 --> 01:34:27,391
And at first they started sponsoring my 
new watch podcasts called watch and 

2074
01:34:27,391 --> 01:34:27,900
listen.
Or watch.

2075
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:29,320
Store watch.
Dark to.

2076
01:34:29,321 --> 01:34:34,321
Yeah.
The logical extension from cars to this 

2077
01:34:34,321 --> 01:34:34,321
is a delicious coffee.
And so thank you.

2078
01:34:34,321 --> 01:34:34,321
Yeah,
I got you.

2079
01:34:34,321 --> 01:34:36,490
I brought you some.
It's a light roast,

2080
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,350
medium body,
single origin.

2081
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:41,560
And that's an a lung and sohne watch.
Thank you.

2082
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:45,730
And that's the back of a long cronograph
oh,

2083
01:34:45,731 --> 01:34:46,540
that's the back.
Yeah,

2084
01:34:46,541 --> 01:34:47,500
the back.
Oh,

2085
01:34:47,501 --> 01:34:48,720
that's beautiful.
That's amazing.

2086
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,100
And that shit's all.
Anything that looks like gold.

2087
01:34:51,101 --> 01:34:52,950
That's gold.
So is that um,

2088
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:56,920
glass or sapphire crystal.
So there's a crystal and the back end.

2089
01:34:56,921 --> 01:34:57,740
The front?
Yes.

2090
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,020
Oh

2091
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:58,590
wow.
Yeah.

2092
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,270
They call that a display back.
Oh.

2093
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:03,950
So just you could show piece.
So you can admire the hardware within.

2094
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:07,850
It is crazy when you look at the detail 
involved in one of those watches,

2095
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:10,860
a lot of parallels with cars.
So many the they've,

2096
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,400
they,
they rose up in parallel.

2097
01:35:13,401 --> 01:35:15,560
I mean the obvious connections of 
timing,

2098
01:35:15,561 --> 01:35:19,370
races and stuff like that.
And wearing a machine on your wrist.

2099
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:26,620
That's called self dealing.
As I went to advertise my own watch for 

2100
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:27,110
sale.
You can do that.

2101
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:28,860
Yeah,
we'll get that.

2102
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:35,360
What's that one on the far right?
That's a panorai that lots called a 

2103
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:39,500
retro,
which is a also known as a split second 

2104
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:43,690
chronograph.
So it's actually two coronagraphs laid 

2105
01:35:43,690 --> 01:35:47,081
on top of each other.
So it would be used to measure the time 

2106
01:35:47,081 --> 01:35:48,560
differential between say two cars on a 
racetrack.

2107
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:51,410
That's the most complicated movement.

2108
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:54,950
Panoramics I think that was about 13 or 
14 grand.

2109
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:57,020
That's a beautiful watch.
Very nice watch.

2110
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:58,430
It's pretty.
That was a demo.

2111
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:00,230
I sent it back,
send it back,

2112
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:01,650
send it back.
I sent,

2113
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:06,720
I said most of them I send them back as 
opposed to giving them 10 grand a month.

2114
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:09,650
Oh,
is that how it works?

2115
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:10,520
Yeah.
The part of my,

2116
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:13,100
I have a sponsorship deal,
crown and caliber.com.

2117
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:14,490
What is it?
What is,

2118
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:16,640
what is the sponsorship deal like?
What does it do?

2119
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:18,790
Well,
I started this watch podcasts,

2120
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:21,530
so they're our title sponsor so they 
gave me a budget for a year,

2121
01:36:21,531 --> 01:36:26,531
but I can also loan out watches out of 
their stock if I so desire to try 

2122
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:28,340
something.
So it's like a chick trying on jewelry.

2123
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,810
Jewelry for men,
right?

2124
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:30,400
Yeah.
Yeah,

2125
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:31,760
it is.
Yeah.

2126
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,710
It's the only jewelry that you can kind 
of get away with.

2127
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:37,270
Pretty much that a fat diamond ring on 
total asshole.

2128
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:42,310
No,
but it makes sense if you have a watch 

2129
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:42,310
that Jonathan Ward from icon,
that was his case.

2130
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:44,850
He brought jonathan is really into old.
Weird watching.

2131
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:47,590
I follow his instagram as well.
He,

2132
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:48,470
he's into old,
weird.

2133
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:50,690
Anything fascinates me.
That guy is.

2134
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:53,030
He's the most interesting person that 
there is.

2135
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:54,680
He's very intense.
He's like,

2136
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:59,681
you like you,
you guys both just do so much stuff.

2137
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:03,860
I don't know where all the hours are in 
the day.

2138
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:07,310
Like he runs his business and he's makes
videos,

2139
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:12,520
but I also see like every weekend and 
steering he'll put up like a handbag he 

2140
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:16,541
made from scratch leather.
Like where did you find the time for 

2141
01:37:16,541 --> 01:37:16,541
that?
Yeah.

2142
01:37:16,541 --> 01:37:20,440
Youtube.
I don't know where you find the time to 

2143
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:20,840
do all this shit.
Illusion because um,

2144
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:22,760
the,
the time I spent here,

2145
01:37:22,761 --> 01:37:23,630
it's very easy.

2146
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:25,490
It's just conversation,
you know,

2147
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:26,720
it's,
it's fun.

2148
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:29,840
It's great having a guy like you get to 
talk cars.

2149
01:37:29,930 --> 01:37:30,970
I agree.
It is crying.

2150
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,020
Um,
standup comedy.

2151
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:35,330
I've done so long.
It's like a part of my life.

2152
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:36,350
Yeah,
it's normal.

2153
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:39,530
The working out stuff,
it's like if I don't do it,

2154
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:41,720
I can't do the other things.
I'll go crazy.

2155
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:44,330
I won't be balanced and I want to stay 
healthy.

2156
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:48,080
So I do that.
So it seems that you seem to churn out a

2157
01:37:48,081 --> 01:37:53,081
large volume of content and you also 
travel ufc and all that kind of stuff 

2158
01:37:53,511 --> 01:37:55,980
and it's a of content.
The unit

2159
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:57,780
you,
you told me the universe rewards,

2160
01:37:57,781 --> 01:37:59,670
hustle while it does I,
you know,

2161
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:01,860
I have that engraved on the back of the 
first rolex.

2162
01:38:01,861 --> 01:38:04,800
I bought myself a really good for you 
matches from you.

2163
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:09,860
That's dope and I sort of lived on that 
mantra for quite a long time until I 

2164
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:15,230
recently.
I actually just totally burned myself 

2165
01:38:15,230 --> 01:38:15,230
out on it a bit.
You can burn yourself out.

2166
01:38:15,230 --> 01:38:17,850
You gotta be real,
real conscious of how your body feels.

2167
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:22,900
Right.
Well that's what I like about what 

2168
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:24,921
you've been saying,
that you're doing cardio seven days a 

2169
01:38:24,921 --> 01:38:26,991
week and that's what happened.
I spent so much time working and 

2170
01:38:26,991 --> 01:38:26,991
focusing on.
I was like,

2171
01:38:26,991 --> 01:38:28,800
look,
as long as I can stand and lift my arms,

2172
01:38:28,801 --> 01:38:32,190
I'm going to keep making videos because 
this shit could all end tomorrow,

2173
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:35,970
but my body completely fell apart and so
I had to go,

2174
01:38:35,971 --> 01:38:38,700
all right,
I think it's time to take care of this.

2175
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:39,630
Well,
sTick with it.

2176
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:44,800
Here's a car analogy here because this 
is your vehicle and the difference 

2177
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:49,311
between having a 500 horsepower engine 
and a hundred and 25 horsepower diesel 

2178
01:38:49,311 --> 01:38:54,200
is literally how you take care of you.
So and if you can turn your body into a 

2179
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:59,151
race car,
you really can't unless you know 

2180
01:38:59,151 --> 01:38:59,151
obviously have disability or something's
wrong with you,

2181
01:38:59,151 --> 01:39:00,770
but for most people the issue is just 
will,

2182
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:05,040
will in their mind and discipline and 
then knowledge,

2183
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:10,080
right standing how to do it correctly.
And I've lost large amounts of weight 

2184
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:13,851
several times in the past I lost,
I've lost 50 pounds and then I lost a 

2185
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:16,380
hundred pounds and then I lost this past
two years,

2186
01:39:16,381 --> 01:39:18,270
another 50.
So like I know how to do it.

2187
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:23,450
What are you doing now differently?
But the difference with this one is I 

2188
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:27,471
wanted to do it every time I've done it 
in the past it has drastically 

2189
01:39:27,471 --> 01:39:27,810
interrupted my day to day life.

2190
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,660
It's like either you go to fat camp and 
do it or you,

2191
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:31,980
whatever,
you know,

2192
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:34,780
it takes away from something.
This one,

2193
01:39:34,781 --> 01:39:37,890
it was much more important to go,
I have a job,

2194
01:39:37,891 --> 01:39:42,891
I have a life,
I have to figure out how to make this 

2195
01:39:42,891 --> 01:39:45,501
work in within that life.
So it became a lot more hotel gyms 

2196
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,540
really doing that.
Really making sure to just do that shit.

2197
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:49,500
Oh,
when you're on the road,

2198
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:51,920
the road is really hard.
Yeah.

2199
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:54,120
It's hard with diet too.
it's very hard.

2200
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:57,150
I don'T.
I didn't change my diet that much.

2201
01:39:57,151 --> 01:40:01,950
I just started exercising a lot.
My big problem wasn't that I ate badly.

2202
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:07,330
It's that I would eat big meals spaced 
very far apart and so my body would go 

2203
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:11,781
into like storage mode,
but now I try and eat smaller meals and 

2204
01:40:11,781 --> 01:40:13,440
more of them and it seems to work much 
more efficiently.

2205
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:15,120
Well,
everybody's body is different,

2206
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:17,100
but for the most part,
one of the biggest,

2207
01:40:17,101 --> 01:40:20,910
most significant things that you can do 
is cut out most sugar.

2208
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,880
Cut out,
most refined carbohydrates.

2209
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:27,540
Red is my achilles.
Everybody I love bread out.

2210
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:29,100
Weight would fly off.
You know,

2211
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:31,710
especially when you're telling me the 
volume of exercise you're doing.

2212
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:32,970
Oh,
cut out the bread,

2213
01:40:32,971 --> 01:40:37,971
cut out the sugar,
you would lose ridiculous amounts of 

2214
01:40:37,971 --> 01:40:38,910
weight.
Know Jordan Peterson was on my podcast.

2215
01:40:38,911 --> 01:40:43,911
He was talking about autoimmune issues 
that he had and what he did was cut out 

2216
01:40:43,911 --> 01:40:45,780
everything except for meat and 
vegetables.

2217
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:47,760
That's it.
And all his problems went away.

2218
01:40:47,761 --> 01:40:48,780
Yeah,
I know I,

2219
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:51,570
I've done the atkins style cave.
Manny,

2220
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:52,850
whatever you want to call it,
you know,

2221
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:54,010
all protein and fat,

2222
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,190
cut out the vegetables and cut all the 
car.

2223
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:57,820
I like,
I,

2224
01:40:57,970 --> 01:40:59,440
it works,
I've done it.

2225
01:40:59,441 --> 01:41:01,900
I've lost weight and it just,
I,

2226
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:07,320
I couldn't stick with it because I 
fucking love bread so much and I just 

2227
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:07,990
don't want to kill myself,
you know what I mean?

2228
01:41:07,991 --> 01:41:12,991
I want to.
It's like it's like growing a show or 

2229
01:41:12,991 --> 01:41:16,591
something.
If the curve is going in the right 

2230
01:41:16,591 --> 01:41:19,531
direction and I'm okaY pushing forward,
let me just push forward.

2231
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:20,830
RiGht.
I'll get there.

2232
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:21,700
I don't,
you know,

2233
01:41:22,210 --> 01:41:27,210
so.
Well it seems like myself currently 

2234
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:29,070
going in the right direction.
Think about saying that you don't want 

2235
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:29,070
to kill yourself.
I get it.

2236
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:32,580
I love bread too and I love pasta.
I'm a big fan of lasagna and I just love

2237
01:41:32,771 --> 01:41:34,090
italian food.
I really do.

2238
01:41:34,091 --> 01:41:35,710
I love pizza.
Um,

2239
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:38,800
but I just limit to one day a week.
That's probably good.

2240
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:41,740
One day a week I allow myself to eat 
whatever the fuck I want and if I decide

2241
01:41:41,741 --> 01:41:46,741
it's wednesday night,
if wednesday night I go out to dinner 

2242
01:41:46,741 --> 01:41:46,741
and I said,
you know what man,

2243
01:41:46,741 --> 01:41:46,810
I want the fucking spaghetti and meat 
balls.

2244
01:41:46,811 --> 01:41:48,760
Let's just do this.
Then that's the night.

2245
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
That's the night I cheat.
And then the other six nights I eat 

2246
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:54,000
normal.
Yeah,

2247
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:54,590
it do it.
I respect your,

2248
01:41:54,591 --> 01:41:58,300
your stick.
It makes it feel better too when you get

2249
01:41:58,301 --> 01:41:59,510
that cheat day.
Yeah.

2250
01:41:59,590 --> 01:42:04,590
Like then it really counts.
And if I get spaghetti with meatballs 

2251
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:05,990
with grated parmesan cheese over it at 
five,

2252
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,260
fucking digging in on that on whatever,
friday night like,

2253
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:12,890
oh,
just let yourself enjoy the glory.

2254
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:16,060
It's not just a regular spaghetti and 
meatballs because it's dinner,

2255
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:17,650
which is normal,
you know,

2256
01:42:17,651 --> 01:42:18,670
on wednesday,
friday,

2257
01:42:18,671 --> 01:42:19,360
whatever.
Who cares?

2258
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:24,480
No,
it's the one day window you could eat 

2259
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:24,480
that fucking pizza.

2260
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:24,790
The cheese.
Maybe.

2261
01:42:24,791 --> 01:42:29,791
This is what I take home from this one.
Maybe I take home the cheat day 

2262
01:42:29,791 --> 01:42:30,280
philosophy from this show.
She days good.

2263
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:33,100
The other thing is your body,
if you get into that habit,

2264
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:36,190
your body won't be craving those things 
anymore because a lot of the reasons why

2265
01:42:36,191 --> 01:42:41,191
you crave it is because your gut 
bacteria that's being supported by that 

2266
01:42:41,191 --> 01:42:44,401
diet and then you sort of go into gut 
bacteria withdrawals and that makes you 

2267
01:42:44,401 --> 01:42:45,570
want more and blah blah blah.
Crazy.

2268
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:49,040
Yeah,
but you got to do is get your a biome in

2269
01:42:49,041 --> 01:42:51,940
check,
like start eating a lot of probiotics.

2270
01:42:52,010 --> 01:42:54,090
Yeah.
Like if you can stomach kimchi.

2271
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:55,660
I don't knoW if you're into that.
I like the taste.

2272
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:58,570
I mean I like korean food.
I don't know how much I can eat.

2273
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:01,150
Kimchi is a daily thing for me.
Really?

2274
01:43:01,151 --> 01:43:02,830
Yup.
Acidophilus.

2275
01:43:02,860 --> 01:43:05,610
A yogurt is good.
If you could eat yogurt,

2276
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:10,500
you have the time to.
To find these kids.

2277
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:12,910
Go to the supermarket,
takes 10 minutes.

2278
01:43:12,911 --> 01:43:14,080
He gets some foods.
I know.

2279
01:43:14,150 --> 01:43:17,260
it was amazing.
I had to run around the city.

2280
01:43:17,261 --> 01:43:22,261
this is why I'm surprised at how you.
How well you do it because running 

2281
01:43:22,261 --> 01:43:24,991
around this city,
you could have a whole day that's three 

2282
01:43:24,991 --> 01:43:29,131
activities and it takes all day to do 
those activities and you barely have 

2283
01:43:29,131 --> 01:43:32,200
time to eat in between the.
I'm just bad at bringing that stuff with

2284
01:43:32,201 --> 01:43:32,660
me,
you know,

2285
01:43:32,661 --> 01:43:34,930
I need to know he's better at carrying 
my own,

2286
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:40,140
whether it's bars or kimchi or whatever 
to bring it with me so that they don't 

2287
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:41,200
get to that.
Oh my god,

2288
01:43:41,201 --> 01:43:42,610
I'm starving.
And then murder.

2289
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:47,800
When you leave,
get me your address and I'll have some 

2290
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:47,800
on it.
Stuff sent to you.

2291
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:52,560
So cool.
Because we have some new onnit protein 

2292
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:52,760
bites,
coconut and cashews.

2293
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:57,380
No guilt or like protein for each one of
these little squares and they're fucking

2294
01:43:57,381 --> 01:43:57,770
hell.
Yeah.

2295
01:43:58,130 --> 01:43:59,780
That'll just get you to the next thing.
Yeah,

2296
01:43:59,781 --> 01:44:01,160
they're heroin.
I like that.

2297
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:02,270
Yeah.
I'll have some sense.

2298
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:04,400
Said that in like three or 400 pounds of
elk.

2299
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:09,490
Oh,
I want to tell you I killed something 

2300
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:09,490
when I went.
I went,

2301
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:09,710
I went hunting.
I went bird hunting.

2302
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:10,670
Uh,
what'd you shoot?

2303
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:12,300
I shot a quail.
Oh,

2304
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:13,580
I used the gun.
I didn't,

2305
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:15,250
you know,
I can't shoot a quail with a hard,

2306
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:20,710
um,
But they were delicious and delicious 

2307
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:20,960
food.
It was really the dogs.

2308
01:44:20,961 --> 01:44:25,280
The dogs were so impressive.
The dogs were amazing,

2309
01:44:25,281 --> 01:44:27,340
well trained,
so super well trained.

2310
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:30,800
Went to this place in south Georgia and 
uh,

2311
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:36,130
they,
they had the most brilliantly trained 

2312
01:44:36,130 --> 01:44:38,480
dogs like I've ever seen.
The dis found everything.

2313
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:42,820
I think I got like 90 birds was a lot.

2314
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:46,760
So you went on a full dick cheney full.
Yeah.

2315
01:44:46,761 --> 01:44:48,470
Without the humans.
I didn't shoot any humans.

2316
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:52,220
this photo.
Did you cook the quail?

2317
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:52,940
No,
they,

2318
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:55,610
they sent me some which I could cook at 
home.

2319
01:44:55,660 --> 01:44:56,330
Um,
but they,

2320
01:44:56,331 --> 01:44:57,440
they,
they were doing them there.

2321
01:44:57,441 --> 01:44:59,720
They were turning the quail breasts into
like nuggets,

2322
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:01,880
nuggets,
but a quail breast.

2323
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:02,930
And then,
uh,

2324
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,080
like the drumsticks banging.
Absolutely delicious.

2325
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:07,260
And what did they cook?
The,

2326
01:45:07,310 --> 01:45:08,870
the,
when you say mcnugget,

2327
01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:10,820
so they breaded that breaded and fried 
it.

2328
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,180
And it was like a whole quail breast was
like a pop it in your mouth nugget.

2329
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:16,700
It was really good.
It's a delicious meat.

2330
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:17,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

2331
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:18,530
Are,
they're crazy,

2332
01:45:18,710 --> 01:45:20,360
crazy tasty birds?
Yeah.

2333
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:25,390
But I didn't,
I was like super conflicted about the 

2334
01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:27,050
hunting portion of it and I don't know 
why I felt I,

2335
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:30,290
my dad was like,
that's like fishing was likely not,

2336
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:35,000
it's not like fishing,
but I didn't feel as guilty as I thought

2337
01:45:35,001 --> 01:45:35,660
I would.

2338
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:37,940
You know what man,
it's like,

2339
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:42,150
and this is a crazy thing to say,
but I'm gonna say it anyway,

2340
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:47,600
it's,
it's like an old relationship like to 

2341
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:48,060
like,
oh,

2342
01:45:48,061 --> 01:45:53,061
like you run into an old girlfriend on 
the street and you haven't seen her 

2343
01:45:53,061 --> 01:45:55,350
since 1989 or somewhere to see where 
this is going.

2344
01:45:55,351 --> 01:45:57,540
Okay,
the fuck it is a long time ago.

2345
01:45:57,541 --> 01:46:00,000
And you run into each other and you 
start talking to each other like,

2346
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:02,250
oh,
I remember you.

2347
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:06,540
I broke up with something.
No,

2348
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:07,860
not even that.
Just you,

2349
01:46:07,861 --> 01:46:12,861
you,
it's a relationship with a hunting an 

2350
01:46:12,861 --> 01:46:12,861
animal.

2351
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:17,880
People feel it very quickly with fishing
because fishing carries very little 

2352
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:17,880
guilt.
Some people like,

2353
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:18,690
oh,
is it hurt?

2354
01:46:18,930 --> 01:46:20,280
Is it,
is it going to get her?

2355
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:25,340
Some people get like that with fish.
Most people don't give a fuck about 

2356
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:25,340
fish.
Little kids.

2357
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:29,810
TheY laugh.
My kids laugh and it's like this 

2358
01:46:29,810 --> 01:46:31,920
flopping and die fish has a fucking hook
through its head and my seven year old 

2359
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:34,130
thinks it's awesome.
Oh my god,

2360
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:39,600
she's so happy that this thing is dying.
That's crazy.

2361
01:46:39,601 --> 01:46:41,870
But if that was a rabbit,
she had never had that reaction.

2362
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:42,410
Right,
right.

2363
01:46:42,530 --> 01:46:45,330
There's a natural thing that we have 
with,

2364
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,470
uh,
with.

2365
01:46:46,530 --> 01:46:51,530
We have a hierarchy of life.
Things that closest to us we feel more 

2366
01:46:51,530 --> 01:46:54,120
connected to.
We don't feel connected at all to bugs.

2367
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:57,780
Nobody gives a fuck about vegan slap 
mosquitoes all day long.

2368
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,520
Nobody gives a shit about that life.

2369
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:04,700
But there is a life that you care about 
when things get warm and they get too 

2370
01:47:05,371 --> 01:47:06,670
close to us.
Yeah.

2371
01:47:06,671 --> 01:47:08,250
When they,
when they get too close to malmo,

2372
01:47:08,251 --> 01:47:09,510
like people freak out.
Yeah.

2373
01:47:09,511 --> 01:47:14,511
I went on a south african safari last 
year and it was like I couldn't fathom 

2374
01:47:14,851 --> 01:47:17,640
someone going and hunting a leopard or 
something like that.

2375
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:19,470
That's a weird thing.
That's a big game.

2376
01:47:19,471 --> 01:47:20,880
Shit,
that's a very weird thing.

2377
01:47:20,881 --> 01:47:22,500
It's a very different thing.
It's not,

2378
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:23,890
it's not.
It's a,

2379
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:28,560
it's almost like what that is and I'm 
not saying it's just sadism,

2380
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:34,280
maybe a little about what that is,
is like it's an aberration off the 

2381
01:47:34,831 --> 01:47:39,831
original idea and this is the only way 
to look at it and people would get mad 

2382
01:47:39,831 --> 01:47:40,080
at me that are hunters because I'm a 
hunter and like,

2383
01:47:40,081 --> 01:47:41,010
what are you saying?
Look,

2384
01:47:41,190 --> 01:47:46,190
it's not the thing to do,
and last year doing it on just to 

2385
01:47:46,190 --> 01:47:47,610
control population,
there's no reason to do it,

2386
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:50,630
but what?

2387
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:55,700
What happened was in the past,
the only reason people hunted was from 

2388
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:56,240
me,
right?

2389
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,430
You barely could stay alive anyway,
and when you went on a hunting party,

2390
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:02,310
he didn't go for sport.
You went to go to kill things.

2391
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:07,640
When you have so much food that you 
don't need to worry about food and 

2392
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:09,030
you've already been shooting all these 
animals.

2393
01:48:09,031 --> 01:48:11,640
Then they start doing these things 
called slams.

2394
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:15,000
They call doing super slams are the 
grand slam.

2395
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:17,990
There's a doll sheep slammed as a sheep 
slam,

2396
01:48:17,991 --> 01:48:20,400
a rocky,
like a big horn sheep slammed.

2397
01:48:20,401 --> 01:48:22,270
there's like a jam burry.
No,

2398
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:22,710
no,
no.

2399
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:28,060
You.
You try to kill one representative of 

2400
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:28,620
each of the subspecies.
My god.

2401
01:48:28,621 --> 01:48:29,400
Really?
Yeah.

2402
01:48:29,401 --> 01:48:31,130
It's a big thing.
It's a big thing with these guys.

2403
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:36,150
Got poker run calm,
like the the big six are the big eight 

2404
01:48:36,150 --> 01:48:37,030
in africa.
Africa.

2405
01:48:37,031 --> 01:48:37,740
It's a big five.

2406
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:38,840
Is that what it is?
The big five,

2407
01:48:39,010 --> 01:48:42,120
the five most dangerous animals to hunt 
on foot.

2408
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:44,880
It's like cheetah lion,
hippo,

2409
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:49,980
rhino,
and whatever the fuck.

2410
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:50,760
Leopard.
Leopard.

2411
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:53,160
Yeah.
There's a bunch of these kind of slams.

2412
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,830
They haven't for turkeys,
they have a wild Turkey slam.

2413
01:48:56,040 --> 01:49:00,000
You get the gould's Turkey,
get the osceola Turkey.

2414
01:49:00,001 --> 01:49:02,130
There's a bunch of different turkeys all
over the country.

2415
01:49:02,131 --> 01:49:04,470
One Florida.
There's one in Mexico.

2416
01:49:04,471 --> 01:49:08,180
It's different Turkey point being people
start collecting.

2417
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,230
It gets.
It gets weird.

2418
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:11,130
Well,
that's the trophy,

2419
01:49:11,131 --> 01:49:11,670
right?
Yeah.

2420
01:49:11,790 --> 01:49:16,790
It's weird.
It's like it gets to this weird place 

2421
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:16,790
like you don't think they shouldn't do 
it.

2422
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:16,790
Like,
okay.

2423
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:18,090
Are you eating the Turkey?
You are.

2424
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,200
Okay.
That's cool.

2425
01:49:19,410 --> 01:49:20,490
Are you eating the deer?
Yep.

2426
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:22,170
Okay.
Well then I have no quarrel,

2427
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:26,960
but when you start going like leopard 
lion was.

2428
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:28,860
I said cheetos.
Elephant was the other one.

2429
01:49:28,861 --> 01:49:29,720
Yeah.
Yeah,

2430
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:34,730
man,
I mean the only reason why you shoot an 

2431
01:49:34,730 --> 01:49:36,651
elephant is if the elephants going on a 
rampage through our village people and 

2432
01:49:36,651 --> 01:49:37,950
you want to protect people's lives and 
I'm on team people.

2433
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:43,130
Other than that,
why the fuck else would you shoot an 

2434
01:49:43,130 --> 01:49:43,130
elephant?
I have no idea.

2435
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:48,660
I saw an elephant.
The biggest elephant I've ever seen as 

2436
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:49,160
far away from me as you were sitting 
right now.

2437
01:49:49,170 --> 01:49:54,170
My god and I almost had a harder to live
in africa on a safari see,

2438
01:49:54,971 --> 01:49:57,640
but I think those things are amazing.
It was amazing.

2439
01:49:57,641 --> 01:50:02,641
It was amazing.
But like you just know what you're 

2440
01:50:02,641 --> 01:50:05,341
doing.
The reason I was so close is because we 

2441
01:50:05,341 --> 01:50:07,060
were watching them push trees down with 
their trunks,

2442
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:11,690
like four or five inch trees just from,
oh my god.

2443
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:14,590
Like it's nothing.
You know what I mean?

2444
01:50:14,591 --> 01:50:17,080
Like you'd crash a car if you hit one of
those,

2445
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:22,110
it would crash the car and like they're 
just phone phone and they're right next 

2446
01:50:22,110 --> 01:50:24,460
to you and if they go on your jeep,
that's the end of that.

2447
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:27,070
You know what's complicated?
Someone was trying to explain this to me

2448
01:50:27,071 --> 01:50:32,071
and I should really be honest about this
guy was trying to explain to me that 

2449
01:50:32,071 --> 01:50:32,740
when we think of africa,
we think of a country,

2450
01:50:32,741 --> 01:50:37,741
it's not a country,
it's a continent and it's way bigger 

2451
01:50:37,741 --> 01:50:37,741
concepts in north America.

2452
01:50:37,741 --> 01:50:39,370
We've seen pictures of United States 
stuck in the middle of africa.

2453
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:42,250
Africa is fucking huge and he's like,
unfortunately,

2454
01:50:42,251 --> 01:50:47,251
there's places in africa where they have
over populations of elephants and they 

2455
01:50:47,251 --> 01:50:50,911
encroach on human civilization and they 
do have to hire hunters to come in and 

2456
01:50:50,911 --> 01:50:51,490
do it and kill them or they don't hire 
them.

2457
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:54,820
The hunters pay and the money goes 
straight to the village.

2458
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:59,821
The meat goes,
the village and people get very excited 

2459
01:50:59,821 --> 01:50:59,930
about people huntIng these elephants and
when,

2460
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:03,670
when I hear that seems like a sort of 
short term solution to the village right

2461
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:08,690
there.
The village doesn't give a shit about 

2462
01:51:08,690 --> 01:51:08,690
the elephants.
They want their,

2463
01:51:08,690 --> 01:51:11,950
they want to eat probably right?
They agency eat their crops but becomes 

2464
01:51:12,551 --> 01:51:13,400
a big issue,
you know,

2465
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:15,910
and they beat the fuck out of there.
You know,

2466
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:18,950
like good luck.
They only keep guiding them.

2467
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:21,550
Lfo now have no chance.

2468
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:23,320
So when someone was explaining this to 
me,

2469
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:25,540
I remember we were saying this,
I was like,

2470
01:51:25,541 --> 01:51:27,340
why the fuck would you ever want to kill
an elephant?

2471
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:29,890
We know there's not that many of them.
He's like,

2472
01:51:29,891 --> 01:51:31,660
yeah,
this is why it's complicated.

2473
01:51:31,661 --> 01:51:36,661
There's not that many of them.
In some places it's like in la there's 

2474
01:51:36,661 --> 01:51:37,490
no grizzly bears.
Right?

2475
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:42,720
But if you go to Montana,
the people that live in Montana are 

2476
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:43,030
going to start hunting these fucking 
things.

2477
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:47,950
They just declared them open for a in 
Wyoming.

2478
01:51:48,290 --> 01:51:50,240
They're not.
They don't have.

2479
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:55,260
They think they just started a hunting 
season and it's very controversial and 

2480
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:56,580
they just end date.
No,

2481
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:58,390
no,
not anymore at all.

2482
01:51:58,510 --> 01:52:01,450
Now they have a lot of them and the 
people that lIve up there,

2483
01:52:01,451 --> 01:52:06,451
especially people that have been mauled 
or know people that have been mauled to 

2484
01:52:06,451 --> 01:52:06,451
like,
hey fucking enough.

2485
01:52:06,650 --> 01:52:08,510
And now I get it.
We,

2486
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:11,440
they made a great comeback.
But you know,

2487
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:14,080
if you're in chicago,
there's zero bears.

2488
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:19,770
So if,
and this is a tiny place in comparison 

2489
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:19,770
to africa.
So when I was saying that like I thought

2490
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:21,430
that elephants were endangered,
he's like,

2491
01:52:21,431 --> 01:52:25,450
yes and no.
They're are endangered in some areas and

2492
01:52:25,451 --> 01:52:30,451
good point to fucked up point.
The most dark point about all of it is 

2493
01:52:30,451 --> 01:52:34,240
that trophy hunting is the only thing 
that keeps those animals healthy.

2494
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:39,270
This is what's fucked up.
I was talking about playing campaigns 

2495
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:40,360
about this this weekend when,
and this is what I say,

2496
01:52:40,361 --> 01:52:45,361
trophy hunting.
I'm even talking about normal hunting 

2497
01:52:45,361 --> 01:52:46,920
for meat,
like impalas or you know elan's these,

2498
01:52:47,070 --> 01:52:50,360
these big game animals that people hunt 
for because they're delicious.

2499
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:55,780
Even them in Zimbabwe.
There's a lot of areas in Zimbabwe that 

2500
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:56,720
are not high fence.

2501
01:52:56,750 --> 01:53:01,750
They're Just open enormous areas.
All the money that would come from 

2502
01:53:01,750 --> 01:53:04,520
people hunting there would sustain these
local areas,

2503
01:53:04,521 --> 01:53:09,521
sustain these lodges so it make it 
viable to keep these animals alive and 

2504
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:12,220
stop poachers.
A big bonds.

2505
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,610
The anti poaching,
right?

2506
01:53:13,611 --> 01:53:18,611
Exactly.
The only thing that funds the anti 

2507
01:53:18,611 --> 01:53:18,611
poaching.
So here's what happened.

2508
01:53:18,611 --> 01:53:19,250
The cecil,
the lion shit went down.

2509
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:24,580
Nobody wanted to go to africa anymore to
go hunting and all of these businesses 

2510
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:26,440
are going under,
so there's nothing stopping the poachers

2511
01:53:26,441 --> 01:53:28,700
so the poachers move in and kill 
everything,

2512
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:31,650
kill everything like that.
It's gone the other way.

2513
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:34,220
How many elephants were killed last year
by people?

2514
01:53:34,221 --> 01:53:39,221
something like 400 or google this 
legally killed elephants.

2515
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:43,550
The number of illegally killed 
elephants.

2516
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:45,650
$30,000
come on.

2517
01:53:45,651 --> 01:53:49,070
30,000.
Most of them are killed illegally.

2518
01:53:49,071 --> 01:53:52,100
Most of them are poached.
They have this one elephant,

2519
01:53:52,101 --> 01:53:54,740
you know that last elephant that was 
dying the mail,

2520
01:53:54,741 --> 01:53:55,740
or excuse me,
rhino,

2521
01:53:55,741 --> 01:53:57,830
rhino,
white rhino or black rhino,

2522
01:53:57,831 --> 01:53:59,120
which was in a black rhino.

2523
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:04,120
I think they have that.
That poor bastard with armed guards 

2524
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:08,081
around it.
Twenty four slash seven because they 

2525
01:54:08,081 --> 01:54:10,481
were worried someone's going to kill it 
and shoot it and chop the fucking horn 

2526
01:54:10,481 --> 01:54:13,361
off.
Like the poaching is way scarier than 

2527
01:54:13,361 --> 01:54:16,391
the hunting and the only thing that 
protects the animals from poaching is 

2528
01:54:16,391 --> 01:54:18,970
hunting.
It sounds so weird and so forth,

2529
01:54:18,971 --> 01:54:20,770
but you have to look at it honestly.
Yeah.

2530
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:22,910
They said something similar to us in 
South Africa,

2531
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:24,160
both that,
that,

2532
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:27,500
that they need the funds because the 
anti poachers,

2533
01:54:27,530 --> 01:54:28,190
you know,
they,

2534
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:29,060
they,
they're,

2535
01:54:29,061 --> 01:54:32,240
they're all over the place.
And then here's the other problem.

2536
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:35,150
When you say poachers,
these poachers,

2537
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:37,310
you know what you're really saying,
poor people.

2538
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,320
That's what you're really saying.
They're poor,

2539
01:54:39,321 --> 01:54:44,321
desperate people.
They don't know what the fuck to do and 

2540
01:54:44,321 --> 01:54:44,321
if they could chop off a rhino's horn 
and make some money,

2541
01:54:44,321 --> 01:54:44,450
they're going to do it.

2542
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:47,720
If they can shoot that animal that's not
theirs and use it for me,

2543
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:49,580
they're going to do it.
They're starving to death.

2544
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:54,850
I mean they have no options.
There's appears people in parts of 

2545
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:55,940
africa that are living in grass huts.
My buddy justin wren,

2546
01:54:55,941 --> 01:54:58,400
he,
he goes and makes wells for these people

2547
01:54:58,401 --> 01:55:03,401
in the Congo and the stories he tells 
you would just make your eyes tear up 

2548
01:55:03,401 --> 01:55:06,760
these human beings and they're living 
like this 24 hours a day for their 

2549
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:07,430
entire life.
And this is,

2550
01:55:07,431 --> 01:55:10,250
this is the norm.
So we're talking about poachers will.

2551
01:55:10,251 --> 01:55:12,440
you're talking about people that are 
fucking desperate.

2552
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:14,270
Yeah,
you can call them poachers,

2553
01:55:14,271 --> 01:55:16,580
you could dehumanize them with that 
term,

2554
01:55:16,581 --> 01:55:19,520
but they're just poor people and none of
them.

2555
01:55:19,521 --> 01:55:22,550
The movie stereotype poachers somehow 
some of them,

2556
01:55:22,580 --> 01:55:24,890
but most of them aren't.
Now here's what's even crazier.

2557
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:29,980
Most of the anti poaching agents used to
be poachers because there's nothing else

2558
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:31,630
to do.
Yeah,

2559
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:33,590
that's not surprising.
NoW they're poachers again,

2560
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:35,920
because they put their hunting people 
who they got out of jail,

2561
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:40,410
they got out of this position that can't
be [inaudible] because they can now.

2562
01:55:40,411 --> 01:55:42,590
They just got back from poachers again.
Perfect.

2563
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:44,190
This happens.
A lot of it's gone well,

2564
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:47,430
so when campaigns was explaining this to
me and when does it explain it to me?

2565
01:55:47,431 --> 01:55:47,790
I'm like,
well,

2566
01:55:47,791 --> 01:55:49,650
of course.
So they don't even know how many animals

2567
01:55:49,651 --> 01:55:51,540
are left in these areas where people 
have abandoned them.

2568
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:54,570
Ranches that were once thriving ways.
You see.

2569
01:55:54,571 --> 01:55:57,290
The thing is most of these animals,
a good percentage of it,

2570
01:55:57,291 --> 01:56:02,291
we're on the verge of extinction just 30
years ago because people were just over 

2571
01:56:02,291 --> 01:56:02,790
hunting them and poaching them and doing
whatever they want it to him.

2572
01:56:02,970 --> 01:56:07,970
Then they started putting value on them.
People would go over there to hunt them 

2573
01:56:07,970 --> 01:56:08,070
so people would keep these huge areas 
in.

2574
01:56:08,071 --> 01:56:11,610
That population boomed because they were
taking care of them because they were.

2575
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:14,900
They were A resource and,
and this is key.

2576
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:17,460
This is conflicting to people.
It's wild.

2577
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:22,520
It's very wild.
I just went to the galapagos on a 

2578
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:22,520
vacation,
which is interesting.

2579
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,570
Have you been.
It seems like you're kind of spot.

2580
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:25,770
I want to,
can't kill anything.

2581
01:56:26,740 --> 01:56:29,130
It's,
it's very,

2582
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:31,740
it's like Hawaii if there were never 
people.

2583
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:32,760
Wow.
So it's an.

2584
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:36,210
It's a completely empty Hawaii.
How big is it?

2585
01:56:36,750 --> 01:56:40,440
About the same size as Hawaii?
The big island or chain of.

2586
01:56:40,441 --> 01:56:43,350
I know it's a chain of islands.
There's probably 13 or 15 islands.

2587
01:56:43,410 --> 01:56:44,440
Whoa.
Yeah.

2588
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:48,990
None as bIg as the big island,
but most the buildings on them,

2589
01:56:49,110 --> 01:56:54,030
there are two or three like towns wIth 
like 25,000

2590
01:56:54,031 --> 01:56:56,850
people and the rest of it is nothing.
National park,

2591
01:56:56,851 --> 01:57:01,851
97 percent.
But they talk about these giant 

2592
01:57:01,851 --> 01:57:01,880
tortoises,
you know,

2593
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:06,950
and there were like potentially a half a
million of them on the islands and it 

2594
01:57:06,950 --> 01:57:10,971
went down to like one,
like they found like a fall last one and

2595
01:57:11,941 --> 01:57:16,941
they tried to breed it.
There's like three varieties of 

2596
01:57:16,941 --> 01:57:19,131
tortoises and the one of them got down 
to one and they tried to save it and 

2597
01:57:19,131 --> 01:57:19,131
they couldn't save it.

2598
01:57:19,131 --> 01:57:19,410
And now it's like,
you know,

2599
01:57:19,450 --> 01:57:23,190
embalmed fucking taxidermy on the 
galapagos islands,

2600
01:57:23,191 --> 01:57:28,191
but you know,
these giant tortoises that lived at 200 

2601
01:57:28,191 --> 01:57:28,191
but the,
um,

2602
01:57:28,191 --> 01:57:33,110
the,
all the passing ships would just like 

2603
01:57:33,110 --> 01:57:35,150
grab a few of them and they'd eat them 
on the ships and they'd completely 

2604
01:57:35,150 --> 01:57:38,721
decimated the entire population.
They're all gone and they're trying to 

2605
01:57:38,721 --> 01:57:38,721
bring them back.
I don't even know why we started here.

2606
01:57:38,721 --> 01:57:40,650
But will they take forever to grow?
Right?

2607
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:43,320
Yeah.
They have 100 years old.

2608
01:57:43,330 --> 01:57:44,650
They live 200 years.
Yeah.

2609
01:57:44,910 --> 01:57:49,910
And then the whole rest of the islands,
what's crazy about them as nothing has 

2610
01:57:49,910 --> 01:57:53,280
been hunted there in forever.
So the wild animals have no problem with

2611
01:57:53,281 --> 01:57:55,020
people.
No problem.

2612
01:57:55,290 --> 01:57:58,200
Like your face to face with sea lions 
and stuff.

2613
01:57:58,230 --> 01:58:03,230
I could be to like birds,
like what kind of wild bird would let 

2614
01:58:03,230 --> 01:58:07,611
you get within a foot of it,
but there's these giant blue footed 

2615
01:58:07,611 --> 01:58:08,490
boobies that have no problem with you.

2616
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:11,370
just being right here,
watching them like where they can have a

2617
01:58:11,371 --> 01:58:13,380
baby right there and they won't even 
fuck with you.

2618
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:17,220
Wow.
And like huge lizards and underwater.

2619
01:58:17,221 --> 01:58:20,640
The densIty of the underwater sea life 
was insane.

2620
01:58:20,641 --> 01:58:25,641
Hammerhead sharks.
I think a baby hammerhead shark is the 

2621
01:58:25,641 --> 01:58:28,110
cutest animal I've ever seen.
a baby hammerhead like this.

2622
01:58:28,210 --> 01:58:33,210
Why the why they developed their eyes 
out there on the end site that 

2623
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:37,020
presumably it's like an echo location or
or radar sonar type of thing.

2624
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:40,110
It gives you better range I think 
because they are in darker waters.

2625
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:42,010
If I had to guess,
they're

2626
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,350
really,
really cool to see in person though.

2627
01:58:44,410 --> 01:58:49,410
There's nothing like a hammerhead shark.
Isn't the galapagos where they had that 

2628
01:58:49,410 --> 01:58:50,470
thing that they were doing with judas 
goats?

2629
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:51,760
Do you know that?
Yes.

2630
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:54,010
That is it.
The goats.

2631
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:54,970
Wait.
Oh,

2632
01:58:55,120 --> 01:59:00,120
captain cook dropped off a bunch of 
goats on those islands and they did it 

2633
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:02,350
so that when they came back they'd have 
something to hunt and the goats go over.

2634
01:59:02,351 --> 01:59:05,130
Ran the island and they.
Oh yeah,

2635
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:10,170
that was a big problems.
They're eating everything and then 

2636
01:59:10,170 --> 01:59:12,660
everything in sight.
And then what did they do with the 

2637
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:12,660
judas?
The judas goes,

2638
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:13,640
had like a disease or something.
Oh no,

2639
01:59:13,641 --> 01:59:14,100
no,
no,

2640
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:14,950
no,
they,

2641
01:59:14,951 --> 01:59:19,951
they took one of them and they say they 
neutered him and then they sent him out 

2642
01:59:19,951 --> 01:59:24,541
with a radio collar on.
So he find out where all their other 

2643
01:59:24,541 --> 01:59:24,541
goats are.
They would gunned them down.

2644
01:59:24,541 --> 01:59:26,740
HelIcopters and they would keep him 
alive.

2645
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:28,260
They would go,
that's the judas goat.

2646
01:59:28,261 --> 01:59:33,261
We keep him alive.
So they've got all these goods down 

2647
01:59:33,261 --> 01:59:33,261
here,
will move,

2648
01:59:33,261 --> 01:59:33,261
kill all,
make,

2649
01:59:33,261 --> 01:59:33,970
makes,
move rooms.

2650
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:39,240
And he would go and make some new 
friends and then they would locate that 

2651
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:40,810
new path because otherwise it's very 
difficult to locate packs that goats,

2652
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:43,020
if you're really going to put a dent in 
the population,

2653
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:44,850
they wanted to wipe them all out.
Yeah,

2654
01:59:44,860 --> 01:59:47,040
there was they,
they killed like 75,000

2655
01:59:47,060 --> 01:59:48,760
goats.
It was a crazy number of goats,

2656
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:52,510
but they were completely overruNning the
whole the whole thing.

2657
01:59:52,750 --> 01:59:53,620
Well,
yeah,

2658
01:59:53,790 --> 01:59:56,590
train sharpshooters from we're sending 
helicopters.

2659
01:59:56,640 --> 02:00:00,250
Scoured goats once found the goatS would
be shot from the air,

2660
02:00:00,251 --> 02:00:02,320
either in the head of the heart to 
ensure a quick death,

2661
02:00:02,350 --> 02:00:06,010
whatever,
using the stop lying.

2662
02:00:06,030 --> 02:00:09,610
They never caught him in the arm.
Yes shot in the face.

2663
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:11,740
They shot him everywhere.
They could there in a helicopter.

2664
02:00:11,741 --> 02:00:16,741
You not even a steady.
Go back to that place so I can keep 

2665
02:00:16,741 --> 02:00:18,661
reading.
Let me you know they're not even in a 

2666
02:00:18,661 --> 02:00:18,661
steady place where they can steadily 
shoot.

2667
02:00:18,661 --> 02:00:19,500
You don't have a good rest from fucking 
hell.

2668
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:23,770
They had mini guns.
Gun in those fuckers down.

2669
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:28,800
Why lie like that in the heart or in the
head to ensure clicked around using high

2670
02:00:30,851 --> 02:00:35,851
powered weapons and military precision.
Stop with your military precision who 

2671
02:00:35,851 --> 02:00:37,150
wrote this?
Many people,

2672
02:00:37,151 --> 02:00:42,151
including the plans orchestrators,
had Misgivings about such a large scale 

2673
02:00:42,151 --> 02:00:45,361
slaughter of goats.
Whoever the decision was made that the 

2674
02:00:45,361 --> 02:00:47,491
galapagos ecosystem under the threat and
under threat found nowhere else on earth

2675
02:00:47,711 --> 02:00:49,540
was valuable enough to justify their 
actions.

2676
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:51,100
Yeah,
there are invasive species.

2677
02:00:51,101 --> 02:00:53,790
History was written by the winners.
It's just.

2678
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:59,180
It's funny.
It's funny that they're essentially 

2679
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,850
preparing for people who are animal 
rights activists writing this.

2680
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,540
That's why they're writing,
you know,

2681
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:04,510
they're shooting them with such 
precision.

2682
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:06,450
It's actually very funny because you 
know,

2683
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:09,460
to the galapagos is ridiculously 
restrictive.

2684
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:14,520
You cannot set foot on a beach like 
there without being like without a 

2685
02:01:15,911 --> 02:01:19,810
naturalist with you the whole time and 
you can't be more than like 50 feet from

2686
02:01:19,811 --> 02:01:21,790
the naturalistic ever.
HOw'd you guys do it?

2687
02:01:21,791 --> 02:01:25,300
Did you hire someone to organized a 
thing?

2688
02:01:25,301 --> 02:01:28,840
It was a smallish yacht with like 30 
people on it.

2689
02:01:28,870 --> 02:01:33,870
I heard they check your shoes to make 
seeds and you rinse off the bottom of 

2690
02:01:33,870 --> 02:01:36,960
your shoes and then they hand sanitize 
you when you get back on the boats.

2691
02:01:36,970 --> 02:01:41,970
They said they've had real issues with 
people that have tramped on on plants 

2692
02:01:41,970 --> 02:01:42,980
and then come to the galapagos.
Now those plants grow there.

2693
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:43,400
Yeah.
Well,

2694
02:01:43,401 --> 02:01:47,390
there's one island that has,
I was expecting tropical,

2695
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:49,730
right,
because hawaii's kind of tropical,

2696
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,530
none of them plants fucking native.

2697
02:01:51,870 --> 02:01:56,870
the ne like none of them.
All the jungle plants were brought 

2698
02:01:56,870 --> 02:02:01,211
there.
Like the galapagos has one island that 

2699
02:02:01,211 --> 02:02:04,571
has jungle on it and all of the rest of 
them are like volcanic rock and cactuses

2700
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:06,860
and shrubs.
Yeah.

2701
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:09,350
NoT what I expected.
And I was like,

2702
02:02:09,351 --> 02:02:12,500
how come this island has a jungle on it?
And the rest of them they said,

2703
02:02:12,501 --> 02:02:14,060
oh,
all these plants are not native.

2704
02:02:14,061 --> 02:02:16,130
They were all brought here.
And like the 17 hundreds.

2705
02:02:17,050 --> 02:02:18,090
Yeah.
Wow.

2706
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:21,020
Yeah.
So the plants that were brought there,

2707
02:02:21,021 --> 02:02:22,100
like those plants.
Whoa.

2708
02:02:22,101 --> 02:02:23,540
Look at that shit.
But I don't.

2709
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:25,580
I'm not sure what that is.
I never saw that.

2710
02:02:25,581 --> 02:02:27,950
But it's awesome.
That looks like an artist's rendering to

2711
02:02:27,951 --> 02:02:32,951
me.
We're looking at this crazy tree that 

2712
02:02:32,951 --> 02:02:32,951
looks like it's right out of the lord of
the rings.

2713
02:02:32,951 --> 02:02:34,610
Dragon's blood tree is what it's called.
That's an awesome name for that.

2714
02:02:34,770 --> 02:02:37,370
Want that shit in my yard.
And we got a big building here.

2715
02:02:37,371 --> 02:02:40,100
Can we get one of those?
Need a dragon blood tree in my life.

2716
02:02:40,101 --> 02:02:43,940
Look at that thing that looks like 
avatar island that floats.

2717
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:47,830
Remember that one that floated.
But uh,

2718
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:49,590
it's the greatest looking tree I've ever
seen.

2719
02:02:49,610 --> 02:02:51,800
It was very cool tree.
It's a weird economy,

2720
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:54,170
but the same naturalists that were like,
you know,

2721
02:02:54,410 --> 02:02:59,410
preserve everything are giddy when they 
talk about shooting goats from a 

2722
02:02:59,410 --> 02:02:59,540
helicopter.
Yeah.

2723
02:02:59,541 --> 02:03:00,260
Well they,
they,

2724
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:02,300
they look at the goats is what they 
really are.

2725
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:05,540
They're an invasive species.
I mean there life lifeforms and the,

2726
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:10,630
it's not their fault that they're there,
but like I was trying to explain to my 

2727
02:03:10,630 --> 02:03:13,661
friend.
I have a buddy of mine who's a thinking 

2728
02:03:13,661 --> 02:03:13,661
about hunting.
He eats meat and he's like,

2729
02:03:13,661 --> 02:03:16,820
if I,
if I'm not going to kill my own meat,

2730
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:19,810
like why should I,
why should I have the right to eat meats

2731
02:03:19,820 --> 02:03:21,110
and this weird moral thing?

2732
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:22,880
And he's like,
I'm thinking about being vegan,

2733
02:03:22,881 --> 02:03:24,590
but I know it's not the right move for 
my health.

2734
02:03:24,591 --> 02:03:25,970
I'm like,
we should try it.

2735
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:27,410
See if it's the right move for your 
health.

2736
02:03:27,411 --> 02:03:30,260
It might work good for your body,
but if you want to shoot something,

2737
02:03:30,710 --> 02:03:34,220
the thing to shoot would be wild pigs 
because they have three,

2738
02:03:34,221 --> 02:03:36,110
four litters a year.
Each one of them,

2739
02:03:36,111 --> 02:03:37,370
they get at four,
five,

2740
02:03:37,371 --> 02:03:42,371
even six babies and they fuck like crazy
and they eat everything and then they 

2741
02:03:42,371 --> 02:03:45,170
might be four or 500 pounds.
Then they can get big kill one of them,

2742
02:03:45,171 --> 02:03:46,730
one of those a year.
You're golden mean,

2743
02:03:46,890 --> 02:03:48,900
but they get fucking.
The point is they they,

2744
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:51,980
they get destructive and there's nothing
that kills them.

2745
02:03:52,010 --> 02:03:54,830
Where do you find these wild pigs?
Everywhere.

2746
02:03:54,831 --> 02:03:56,990
They're all over the country now.
I don't hunt joe.

2747
02:03:56,991 --> 02:03:57,730
Where's?
It's not even.

2748
02:03:58,190 --> 02:04:03,190
It's not even a hunting issue.
It's people live in san jose or have a 

2749
02:04:03,190 --> 02:04:04,610
problem with wild pigs going through 
your backyard and fucking theM up.

2750
02:04:04,611 --> 02:04:09,611
Yeah.
It's a real issue because because no 

2751
02:04:09,611 --> 02:04:09,611
one's paid attention to them.
People are getting their highway,

2752
02:04:09,611 --> 02:04:11,540
getting going to school,
stopping at starbucks,

2753
02:04:11,541 --> 02:04:13,200
doing the normal shit while this is 
happening.

2754
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:16,820
They're out there In the bush,
earn it that fucking,

2755
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:22,030
and they're making babies and there's a 
shit ton of placement all over from 

2756
02:04:23,031 --> 02:04:28,031
bakersfield on up.
Northern California filled with wild 

2757
02:04:28,031 --> 02:04:28,580
pigs.
Are they tasting to that?

2758
02:04:29,070 --> 02:04:34,070
Are they taste like they taste like 
domestic pigs currently exist in 56 of 

2759
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:36,230
the state's 58 counties.
Wow.

2760
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:37,410
Yeah.
Where's that?

2761
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:39,690
What state is that?
California,

2762
02:04:40,050 --> 02:04:45,050
California.
Fifty six of the state's 58 counties of 

2763
02:04:45,050 --> 02:04:45,050
wild pigs.
Okay,

2764
02:04:45,050 --> 02:04:45,450
so when you say everywhere,
you're not fucking around.

2765
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:47,700
No,
they are a biological plague.

2766
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:52,880
They're completely invasive species and 
they're designed to live in places with 

2767
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:55,260
wolves and lions and I mean that's what 
their origins are.

2768
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:56,310
What do they taste?
Good.

2769
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:58,190
Phenomenal.
Really better.

2770
02:04:58,200 --> 02:04:59,730
Like domestic pork.
Great.

2771
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:00,900
Yeah.
Especially when you cook them,

2772
02:05:00,901 --> 02:05:05,901
right?
Like you take a ham and you like slow 

2773
02:05:05,901 --> 02:05:05,901
smoker.
Yeah.

2774
02:05:05,901 --> 02:05:06,750
Brian,
it made me for a few days.

2775
02:05:06,751 --> 02:05:08,820
First dude,
I'm telling you,

2776
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:12,520
god damn delicious.
Not surprisingly delicious plAgue.

2777
02:05:13,770 --> 02:05:15,000
They're everywhere and they eat 
everything.

2778
02:05:15,001 --> 02:05:17,940
Ground nesting birds like fucking 
anything on the ground.

2779
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:19,740
They just,
they're just all the time.

2780
02:05:19,741 --> 02:05:22,520
We're fucking up people'S lawns,
digging in people.

2781
02:05:22,550 --> 02:05:24,990
Anybody who just want to be ready,
you just,

2782
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:30,460
someone's paid,
they have habit things be locked and 

2783
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:30,630
loaded in your yard and will in Texas 
they just shoot them.

2784
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:32,370
I mean,
theY did get into helicopters.

2785
02:05:32,371 --> 02:05:35,330
They have the helicopters.
Yeah,

2786
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:40,670
I was,
I was at a thing and a guy was telling 

2787
02:05:40,670 --> 02:05:40,670
me about shooting pigs from a 
helicopter.

2788
02:05:40,670 --> 02:05:41,970
There you go.
A pork lIps now is what you want to look

2789
02:05:41,971 --> 02:05:44,670
up a guy named.
it's not a porno.

2790
02:05:44,750 --> 02:05:45,220
No,
no.

2791
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:46,590
Should it be?
Probably is too.

2792
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:49,870
But It's a guy named pig man.
Uh,

2793
02:05:50,190 --> 02:05:54,300
who I'm buddies with this guy a text or 
text each other.

2794
02:05:54,330 --> 02:05:59,330
I know him.
You and peg texts me and I text him 

2795
02:05:59,330 --> 02:05:59,330
back.
I was like,

2796
02:05:59,330 --> 02:05:59,330
okay,
it's crazy.

2797
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:01,200
He's a good dude.
But anyway,

2798
02:06:01,201 --> 02:06:03,030
he um,
he's,

2799
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:05,940
his whole thing is eradicating these 
wild pigs.

2800
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:11,320
They did them with 10 new gen or they're
shooting machine guns out of fucking 

2801
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:13,920
helicopter and they killed 200 and 
something of them in one day.

2802
02:06:13,950 --> 02:06:16,440
30 feral hogs.
And now in 37 states,

2803
02:06:16,441 --> 02:06:18,720
look at this.
While this is a point $5,

2804
02:06:18,721 --> 02:06:21,900
billion in crop damage yearly.
I mean,

2805
02:06:21,901 --> 02:06:24,840
I liked the,
I like the anti pig propaganda film.

2806
02:06:24,870 --> 02:06:28,290
This was 6 million hogs in Texas alone.

2807
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:31,410
Do you know how crazy that is?
And again,

2808
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:35,640
delicious.
they've got a bunch of brucellosis and a

2809
02:06:35,641 --> 02:06:39,960
bunch of different terrible diseases.
So fuck ted nugent.

2810
02:06:40,530 --> 02:06:41,370
Well,
how dare you,

2811
02:06:41,610 --> 02:06:45,210
ted.
Ted nugent sucks.

2812
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:48,540
Well he's definitely got issues.
Yes.

2813
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:54,770
So they're up there with machine guns 
gunning down these wild pigs out of 

2814
02:06:55,441 --> 02:06:59,940
helicopters and parties.
Like They shouldn't be able to do this,

2815
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:04,170
but party is like they have to do this 
because if they don't do this then these

2816
02:07:04,171 --> 02:07:05,850
things keep breeding and there's more of
a.

2817
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:10,910
They don't eradicate the numbers.
What's to stop these things from just 

2818
02:07:10,910 --> 02:07:13,020
spreading across the entire country and 
becoming a real problem?

2819
02:07:13,021 --> 02:07:14,100
well,
there already are a real problem.

2820
02:07:14,101 --> 02:07:19,101
So what do you do?
Which part of you goes that looks kind 

2821
02:07:19,101 --> 02:07:19,101
of fun.
It looks the were very fun.

2822
02:07:19,290 --> 02:07:21,010
If it wasn't a life form,
it looks.

2823
02:07:21,020 --> 02:07:21,530
Yeah,
I would.

2824
02:07:21,630 --> 02:07:23,790
I would want to do that with like 
targets.

2825
02:07:23,791 --> 02:07:26,400
Like do they,
can they do that and put one nba tarGets

2826
02:07:26,401 --> 02:07:27,840
out there?
Fun.

2827
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:31,470
You'd you'd want to do it with,
but the thing is like you see a mama and

2828
02:07:31,471 --> 02:07:36,471
her babies and I mean it's the whole 
thing is it's kind of fucked up because 

2829
02:07:39,190 --> 02:07:41,230
there's not a whole lot of other ways to
do this.

2830
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:46,260
Here's the thing,
it's like you got to locate them on 

2831
02:07:46,260 --> 02:07:46,260
these enormous ranches,
so what are you going to do?

2832
02:07:46,260 --> 02:07:49,340
You're going to have people go out there
with a,

2833
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:54,360
you know,
hunting camps and slowly make their way 

2834
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:56,821
through the bushes or in that they would
might kill 250 of them in a month or 

2835
02:07:57,011 --> 02:08:00,670
these guys get $250 an argument.
The efficiency of this process.

2836
02:08:00,671 --> 02:08:03,370
This is extremely efficient.
It is an epidemic.

2837
02:08:03,371 --> 02:08:06,040
Don't mean What they're saying is 
accurate.

2838
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:11,070
You seeiNg all these pigs,
I mean look at the populations that 

2839
02:08:11,070 --> 02:08:14,431
these guys are gunning down and this is 
just a fraction of what exists is the 

2840
02:08:14,431 --> 02:08:14,431
shot right there.

2841
02:08:14,431 --> 02:08:16,150
That was like right out of the 
godfather,

2842
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:19,000
the pig hanging from a helicopter.
The helicopter.

2843
02:08:19,420 --> 02:08:21,150
Look at that.
Oh me,

2844
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:24,870
that freeze frame on ted nugent's face 
was an extra creepy coming.

2845
02:08:26,540 --> 02:08:30,100
Wait on a real show.
Oh yeah,

2846
02:08:30,101 --> 02:08:32,190
yeah.
this was a goof.

2847
02:08:32,250 --> 02:08:33,730
I know.
Real real.

2848
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:37,390
Oh my God.
Poor calypso pork lips.

2849
02:08:37,391 --> 02:08:42,391
His episodes on pigmenTs show by so.
But you see as a peRson who loves 

2850
02:08:44,141 --> 02:08:48,010
animals and he also eats meat.
I understand conflict.

2851
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:51,220
You know I love animals.
I love wild animals.

2852
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:52,840
I love pets.
I love them,

2853
02:08:52,841 --> 02:08:57,841
but I also eat meat and they do too.
There's a weird relationship going on 

2854
02:08:57,841 --> 02:09:00,490
with people and animals,
but that to me in modern world is one of

2855
02:09:00,491 --> 02:09:05,491
the weirder aspects.
Flying around a helicopter gunning down 

2856
02:09:05,491 --> 02:09:10,230
feral pigs that destroy cop crops caused
billions of dollars in damage and are 

2857
02:09:10,230 --> 02:09:11,530
spreading across the entire country.

2858
02:09:11,530 --> 02:09:14,620
What else do you do know?
It just seems so unfair,

2859
02:09:17,070 --> 02:09:18,460
tara.
One hundred percent unfair,

2860
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:23,640
but the question is,
is it unfair if you're jogging through 

2861
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:23,640
the woods and a bear,
he you.

2862
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:27,090
is that unfair?
that seems unfair to probably also 

2863
02:09:27,090 --> 02:09:27,090
unfair.
I mean,

2864
02:09:27,090 --> 02:09:29,941
you barely levels of unfair,
barely able to just sustain a nice pace 

2865
02:09:29,941 --> 02:09:30,730
and go jogging.
If yOu've got to rustle up there,

2866
02:09:30,850 --> 02:09:33,020
just trying to drop a few lbs.
Sit man,

2867
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:36,060
I didn't want to get eaten this grizzly.
Fucking nowhere.

2868
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:37,370
I don't know man.
We got to.

2869
02:09:37,371 --> 02:09:39,010
We have weirD relationships with 
animals.

2870
02:09:39,011 --> 02:09:40,160
You know,
I know you eat meat.

2871
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:45,360
I do.
Obviously I don't feel too guilty about 

2872
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:49,351
it either.
I don't eat meat from the grocery store 

2873
02:09:49,351 --> 02:09:49,351
and I don't feel too guilty about it.
I'm sorry to say.

2874
02:09:49,351 --> 02:09:52,020
Well I'm.
Yeah,

2875
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:54,450
that's fuckIng life.
What do you,

2876
02:09:54,510 --> 02:09:56,110
do you feel bad about factory farming?

2877
02:09:56,980 --> 02:10:01,660
I try to buy good quality meat from good
quality places and.

2878
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:03,760
But that's the,
that's about,

2879
02:10:04,090 --> 02:10:07,840
I don't know.
I like farm raised fish and you know,

2880
02:10:07,841 --> 02:10:10,180
I don't know.
Try and buy good shit if I can.

2881
02:10:10,181 --> 02:10:12,950
I prefer to eat high quality things,
you know,

2882
02:10:14,050 --> 02:10:16,480
but I don't know.
She talked about cars more.

2883
02:10:16,570 --> 02:10:17,650
Yep.
Do we want to.

2884
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:19,030
Do you want to end?
Yeah.

2885
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:20,500
What else is,
what else are you seeing?

2886
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:22,130
And if we just had.
We just got.

2887
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:26,440
We stumbled into a,
an area of dead animals and this is your

2888
02:10:26,441 --> 02:10:27,310
show.
So that's what,

2889
02:10:27,311 --> 02:10:29,620
that's what's going to happen.
I didn't mean to bring it there,

2890
02:10:29,660 --> 02:10:31,210
but this,
this is when I get to talk to you.

2891
02:10:31,211 --> 02:10:33,830
So what are you going to do a.
So it happens.

2892
02:10:34,420 --> 02:10:36,370
Um,
I'll tell you what I'm interested in,

2893
02:10:36,380 --> 02:10:38,210
man.
I'm interested in that new corvette.

2894
02:10:38,211 --> 02:10:42,380
Zr one going to drive it next week on 
monday and tuesday at road atlanta.

2895
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:44,840
That thing looks ridiculous.
Seven hundred and 50 horsepower.

2896
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:45,980
See,
that's what I'm talking about.

2897
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:51,340
When are they going to stop?
I think thousand horsepower and a in a 

2898
02:10:51,340 --> 02:10:52,760
regular car that people can buy in 
China.

2899
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:53,720
Yes.
Yeah.

2900
02:10:53,721 --> 02:10:55,970
You know what,
we'll probably do it first actually.

2901
02:10:56,060 --> 02:10:57,620
Um,
in terms of like a quote,

2902
02:10:57,621 --> 02:11:02,240
regular car with a thousand horsepower 
would probably be electric,

2903
02:11:02,270 --> 02:11:04,640
like an electric car because it's so 
easy to make that power,

2904
02:11:04,660 --> 02:11:06,620
to look at that.
It's aggressive.

2905
02:11:06,710 --> 02:11:08,480
Holy shit.
That's aggressive.

2906
02:11:08,570 --> 02:11:10,400
And you see they had to put this 
monster,

2907
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:13,670
a power bulge in the hood there.
Center.

2908
02:11:14,050 --> 02:11:15,410
Um,
so,

2909
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:20,440
you know,
this corvette zero six was out before 

2910
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:20,440
and it was very fast,
650 horsepower,

2911
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:25,630
but it had this issue where it was heat 
soaking a wherein like it was you lose 

2912
02:11:25,731 --> 02:11:28,820
power because the supercharger would 
develop so much heat,

2913
02:11:29,120 --> 02:11:34,120
um,
and it was a small supercharger to fit 

2914
02:11:34,120 --> 02:11:38,261
under the low hood because every,
the low hood is sort of a thing for 

2915
02:11:38,261 --> 02:11:42,521
corvette and the way to make more power 
while also creating less heat is to use 

2916
02:11:43,641 --> 02:11:48,641
a bigger supercharger and spin it slower
as opposed to a smaller one that spun 

2917
02:11:48,981 --> 02:11:49,580
faster.

2918
02:11:50,090 --> 02:11:52,490
So they had to put a bigger one,
which also,

2919
02:11:52,491 --> 02:11:54,750
which raises the hood.
So you fuck with,

2920
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:57,440
you don't know yet a even drIven,
it was going to say your,

2921
02:11:57,590 --> 02:11:59,000
your vantage point,
your viewpoint.

2922
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:00,010
I don't know,
I,

2923
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:05,040
I,
I'll report back you put that couple of 

2924
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:05,040
weeks,
but I think it's definitely a big,

2925
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:08,180
a big old cow hood.
I have driven,

2926
02:12:08,190 --> 02:12:10,790
um,
there's a company called callaway.

2927
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,140
You've heard of them?
Yes.

2928
02:12:12,180 --> 02:12:16,760
They modify the wing back to that image 
that you just had.

2929
02:12:17,390 --> 02:12:22,390
The uh,
the aero package is certainly 

2930
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:22,390
aggressive.
Look at that thing.

2931
02:12:22,390 --> 02:12:22,640
Yeah,
it's a beast.

2932
02:12:22,641 --> 02:12:24,350
Yeah.
That looks so good.

2933
02:12:24,710 --> 02:12:26,270
So I've.
I have driven,

2934
02:12:26,460 --> 02:12:31,460
have a corvette of this generation that 
has an engine like this and I can see 

2935
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:35,600
that drove something called the callaway
arrow wagon.

2936
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:39,320
They actually turned a corvette into 
like a shooting brake,

2937
02:12:39,380 --> 02:12:40,100
like a wagon.

2938
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:41,840
Oh god.
It's not that bad.

2939
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:45,500
It's pretty cool.
But it had 775 horsepower and it was one

2940
02:12:45,501 --> 02:12:47,900
of the scariest cars I've ever driven 
that side profile,

2941
02:12:47,901 --> 02:12:49,580
that look,
you can get it as a convertible.

2942
02:12:49,610 --> 02:12:50,880
Wow.
That's amazing.

2943
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:53,660
Zero one is a convertible.
They do anything to extra.

2944
02:12:53,661 --> 02:12:55,430
Stiffen it up.
They actually,

2945
02:12:55,431 --> 02:13:00,431
the reason they do this is they say that
the roof itself is not a contributor 

2946
02:13:01,010 --> 02:13:06,010
towards the chassis rigidity,
so they can sell the car as a coupe or 

2947
02:13:06,010 --> 02:13:07,190
convertible without any loss of 
rigidity.

2948
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:11,750
That's what they say thing drives like.
Honestly,

2949
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:14,360
I think you're a douche if you buy a car
one convertible.

2950
02:13:14,510 --> 02:13:15,620
Wow.
How dare you.

2951
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:20,720
Because you're just thinking about 
binding by the coop and take the roof 

2952
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:23,201
off.
You can buy the coop and take the hard 

2953
02:13:23,201 --> 02:13:23,201
roof rafters.
That's not the same.

2954
02:13:23,201 --> 02:13:24,050
It's not the same.
It is because you don't like a douche.

2955
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:27,100
Convertibles for douchebags,
the fa,

2956
02:13:27,130 --> 02:13:32,010
the top performing corvette engine track
package

2957
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:37,010
with an aero kit in a convertible.
Go back to that picture of the red 

2958
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:37,350
convertible again,
jamie,

2959
02:13:37,490 --> 02:13:40,470
the people who suck.
How dare you.

2960
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:43,890
Who you son of a bItch.
what are you doing with the top down and

2961
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:47,200
outgoing,
amazing wing look and like a planning.

2962
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:50,180
Can you break down what's your verdict?
Convertible,

2963
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:51,650
convertible,
tsl.

2964
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:56,690
Music and letting people know.
in this instance were you driving with 

2965
02:13:57,260 --> 02:13:59,190
was with you.
You just by yourself.

2966
02:13:59,191 --> 02:14:00,490
Just you and me.
By yourself.

2967
02:14:00,491 --> 02:14:02,760
It's not to the no convertible.
If you're a girl.

2968
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:04,290
Oh,
okay.

2969
02:14:04,291 --> 02:14:05,900
For us to know convertible.
Yeah.

2970
02:14:05,930 --> 02:14:10,930
We look desperate out there by herself 
in a convertible and the convertible is 

2971
02:14:10,930 --> 02:14:11,970
weird.
That's a good point.

2972
02:14:12,150 --> 02:14:14,020
A guy and a girl.
That's a very good point.

2973
02:14:14,030 --> 02:14:18,290
So in the convertible is still weird.
It's still weird for you in 2018.

2974
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:23,900
Well not there,
but any convertible to guys in any 

2975
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:24,300
convertible.
It's weird.

2976
02:14:24,370 --> 02:14:25,760
So what do you losers doing?

2977
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:31,830
Real men don't put the top down by 
yourself.

2978
02:14:31,831 --> 02:14:34,210
Yes.
You can tell somebody.

2979
02:14:34,430 --> 02:14:35,820
I'm just driving around.
You know,

2980
02:14:35,821 --> 02:14:37,470
you can tell someone's a real bad 
driver.

2981
02:14:37,710 --> 02:14:40,530
That's a really surefire way to tell 
someone's a terrible driver.

2982
02:14:40,540 --> 02:14:44,760
If they've got a convertible and it's 
like a and they put the windows down,

2983
02:14:44,761 --> 02:14:46,680
but the front windows go down in a 
little back.

2984
02:14:46,681 --> 02:14:51,681
Windows stay up lIke a three series bmw 
where they don't notice those little 

2985
02:14:51,681 --> 02:14:53,790
rear windows are just still up by 
themselves.

2986
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,740
That's how you can tell someone's a bad 
driver.

2987
02:14:55,770 --> 02:14:57,210
Never checks their blind spots.
Well,

2988
02:14:57,211 --> 02:15:02,211
even when you drive it in a convertible 
with the windows up like stop for is 

2989
02:15:02,211 --> 02:15:02,211
even worse.
Two guys in the back too.

2990
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:05,040
Oh,
that's in venice.

2991
02:15:05,041 --> 02:15:10,041
I see that.
I see all the convertible mustangs 

2992
02:15:10,041 --> 02:15:10,041
loaded up.
When I see that,

2993
02:15:10,041 --> 02:15:14,421
I always look at those four guys and 
like one of those guys dead weight 

2994
02:15:14,421 --> 02:15:14,421
guaranteed.

2995
02:15:14,421 --> 02:15:15,490
One of those guys that paIn in the ass.
Three of them hating the other.

2996
02:15:15,620 --> 02:15:20,620
Yeah.
One of those guys always short on how 

2997
02:15:20,620 --> 02:15:20,910
much he puts in for the tab.
It's funny,

2998
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:25,940
one of those guys,
and you never pay every two weeks when 

2999
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:29,220
I'm doing better.
I'll pay man.

3000
02:15:29,310 --> 02:15:31,830
Fuck you.
That looks so good though.

3001
02:15:31,831 --> 02:15:34,170
Pull that picture up again.
It's really good.

3002
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,290
That looks amazing.
Red with black that,

3003
02:15:38,330 --> 02:15:41,760
that [inaudible] convertible debt.
It's fucking amazing dude.

3004
02:15:41,761 --> 02:15:46,761
And it's apparently faster around 
Virginia international raceway than the 

3005
02:15:46,761 --> 02:15:50,361
ford gt,
which we just looked at and the ford gt 

3006
02:15:50,361 --> 02:15:50,361
is like a race car,
race car.

3007
02:15:50,361 --> 02:15:52,680
this thing as like a big trunk and you 
know,

3008
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:54,900
it's a,
for all intents and purposes,

3009
02:15:54,901 --> 02:15:56,640
it's pretty normal car.
That's awesome.

3010
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:58,040
I like how it's not,
you know,

3011
02:15:58,050 --> 02:16:03,050
it's not,
there's not a lot of sacrifice going on 

3012
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:03,050
with driving one of those,
you know,

3013
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:03,050
you,
you get in it,

3014
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:07,780
you drive it and it's got a big trunk 
and freezing them comfortable and easy 

3015
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:12,231
to live with.
But It's interesting that this is like 

3016
02:16:12,231 --> 02:16:12,231
this game of like,
okay,

3017
02:16:12,231 --> 02:16:16,911
let's look at watches.
There's no real improvement in 

3018
02:16:16,911 --> 02:16:16,911
performance.
Right?

3019
02:16:16,911 --> 02:16:21,020
I mean they're beautiful and.
But I mean the performance difference 

3020
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:21,270
between now and 10 years ago is not 
clear.

3021
02:16:21,470 --> 02:16:24,330
Yeah.
And a mechanical watch to know.

3022
02:16:24,331 --> 02:16:29,331
I mean it's such,
there's artistry and there's 

3023
02:16:29,331 --> 02:16:29,890
technological complication.
I mean it's,

3024
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:33,930
there's complication for the sake of 
complications.

3025
02:16:33,931 --> 02:16:37,780
So they'll have watches like to use the 
car example,

3026
02:16:38,650 --> 02:16:41,350
imagine a car.
Okay.

3027
02:16:41,410 --> 02:16:44,170
And from the outside it looks roughly 
like a normal car,

3028
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:45,580
right?
For four wheels,

3029
02:16:45,740 --> 02:16:47,140
don't the driver's seat,
right?

3030
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:52,660
It has one engine and it has for 
transmissions coming off of that engine,

3031
02:16:53,470 --> 02:16:57,220
all of which come back together to make 
it the car.

3032
02:16:57,310 --> 02:17:01,480
One wheel drive,
[inaudible] right.

3033
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:06,660
Imagine that applied to a watch.
So it'll be like one main movement that 

3034
02:17:07,541 --> 02:17:12,541
goes out into four gear trains and then 
comes back into just an hour and a 

3035
02:17:12,731 --> 02:17:17,731
minute hand.
well why would you sync up for gear 

3036
02:17:17,731 --> 02:17:18,310
trains when you could do the same thing 
with one?

3037
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:19,270
And it's like,
well,

3038
02:17:19,271 --> 02:17:22,060
because we can,
it would be like building a car with two

3039
02:17:22,061 --> 02:17:24,040
engines.
Like that's not smart,

3040
02:17:24,370 --> 02:17:29,370
but you do it.
Just be like god built the fucking car 

3041
02:17:29,370 --> 02:17:29,370
with two engine less.

3042
02:17:29,370 --> 02:17:29,800
You're talking about like the nsx 
engine,

3043
02:17:29,801 --> 02:17:32,470
we have the front engine electric.
Exactly,

3044
02:17:32,471 --> 02:17:37,471
exactly.
But I think what I'm getting at is that 

3045
02:17:37,471 --> 02:17:41,100
with computers and with cars,
those are the one thing that you expect 

3046
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:41,560
and improvement every year.
Yeah,

3047
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:44,170
just that nobody's going to accept the 
old way.

3048
02:17:44,310 --> 02:17:47,860
You can't just build unless your singer 
and you make something custom.

3049
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:51,790
Well that's that the singer is what that
example was,

3050
02:17:51,791 --> 02:17:56,410
what the mechanical watch kind of 
industry is,

3051
02:17:56,440 --> 02:17:57,060
you know,
they,

3052
02:17:57,061 --> 02:18:02,061
they position it as a luxury item from a
time gone by sort of thing,

3053
02:18:02,801 --> 02:18:07,801
you know.
Whereas actually if you want to talk 

3054
02:18:07,801 --> 02:18:09,391
about innovation,
this right here is a grand seiko which 

3055
02:18:09,391 --> 02:18:10,840
has a movement called a spring drive 
movement in it.

3056
02:18:11,170 --> 02:18:16,170
And it is one of the most advanced and 
unique mechanical movements available in

3057
02:18:16,571 --> 02:18:18,370
a watch today.
So this is a seiko.

3058
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:20,060
It's a grand seiko,
which is.

3059
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:22,060
So the difference is,
uh,

3060
02:18:22,150 --> 02:18:24,640
it's like,
think about a lexis.

3061
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:28,510
Think about alexis.
A seiko is a lexus,

3062
02:18:28,511 --> 02:18:30,850
not a toyota.
This is a lexus.

3063
02:18:30,851 --> 02:18:35,851
Lfa.
A grand seiko is built in a different 

3064
02:18:35,851 --> 02:18:38,560
factory from the regular seikos.
It's built by hand,

3065
02:18:38,561 --> 02:18:40,780
completely by hand,
all hand finished,

3066
02:18:40,781 --> 02:18:44,380
hand polished.
It's built of exotic materials.

3067
02:18:44,410 --> 02:18:47,570
It has a cool movement.
Do you should sell watches,

3068
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:49,150
watch podcasts,
watching,

3069
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:50,860
listening.
It's on youtube,

3070
02:18:51,670 --> 02:18:54,400
but yeah,
I mean I have what is called the display

3071
02:18:54,401 --> 02:18:57,820
back on this.
You can see the movement in the back and

3072
02:18:57,821 --> 02:19:02,821
how high the level of finishes and 
you've got sapphire and titanium and um,

3073
02:19:04,990 --> 02:19:08,380
so the spring drive movement is without 
getting crazy,

3074
02:19:08,381 --> 02:19:09,640
crazy nerdy about it.
Is,

3075
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:12,910
is actually a true innovation in 
mechanical watchmaking.

3076
02:19:13,090 --> 02:19:18,090
So run the chronograph is on the front.
The top button not here to watch the 

3077
02:19:18,090 --> 02:19:19,900
sweep of the coronagraph hand.

3078
02:19:19,930 --> 02:19:23,980
The big secondhand.
you get a perfectly smooth sweep.

3079
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:27,530
The smoothest possible sweep that there 
be.

3080
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:28,880
It is smooth.
It is,

3081
02:19:29,750 --> 02:19:30,530
it is,
it is.

3082
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:33,460
How much is the website?
This worth around?

3083
02:19:33,470 --> 02:19:35,690
10,000.
Amazing.

3084
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:37,190
Yeah.
God.

3085
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:42,610
But it's just watch $300.
Well that's no g shocks are the shit 

3086
02:19:42,831 --> 02:19:44,050
dude.
300 bucks.

3087
02:19:44,110 --> 02:19:46,880
G shocks are awesome as far as that of a
light.

3088
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:47,930
No,
but it hasn't been,

3089
02:19:48,110 --> 02:19:49,980
but it's polished so that it can see in 
the dark.

3090
02:19:50,010 --> 02:19:51,050
The date.
Motherfucker.

3091
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:52,710
Look dude,
geez.

3092
02:19:52,711 --> 02:19:56,180
Shocks are dope.
A g shock is a watch guys.

3093
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:58,880
Tool watch,
like highly functional,

3094
02:19:58,881 --> 02:20:02,360
durable.
I'm a g shock is a total watch.

3095
02:20:02,361 --> 02:20:07,361
Guys watch.
You can get gi shocks that are like 

3096
02:20:07,361 --> 02:20:07,361
$5,000.
You know what?

3097
02:20:07,361 --> 02:20:07,361
Yeah,
they have dude.

3098
02:20:07,361 --> 02:20:08,700
Jamie,
look up a $5,000

3099
02:20:09,710 --> 02:20:11,510
here.
Hold that up.

3100
02:20:11,570 --> 02:20:14,330
That's shawn martin.
Wards own design.

3101
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:17,270
It's cool.
I thiNk it's based on the duesberg.

3102
02:20:17,300 --> 02:20:19,160
Yeah.
Duesenberg gauge cLuster.

3103
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:24,280
The watch is called the doozy and it's 
got a complication on it called a jump.

3104
02:20:24,441 --> 02:20:26,960
Our complicaTion,
so the.

3105
02:20:26,990 --> 02:20:31,990
It's a basically just the black face 
almost looks like a bathroom scale and 

3106
02:20:31,990 --> 02:20:35,921
it's got two windows.
Ours on top minutes on the bottom and 

3107
02:20:35,921 --> 02:20:39,671
the minutes sweep by slowly.
Whereas the hours do not sweet by slowly

3108
02:20:40,581 --> 02:20:44,810
at 59 and 59 seconds.
The hours click over write fast.

3109
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:49,520
So it's a jump power as opposed to a 
slow moving our.

3110
02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:52,910
Now he designed the look or did he 
design the internals?

3111
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:55,520
He designed the look,
the face,

3112
02:20:55,610 --> 02:21:00,610
the complications and he worked with a 
swiss watchmaker to design an actual 

3113
02:21:01,521 --> 02:21:06,170
unique movement to use for this watch.
He designed the case and that's crazy.

3114
02:21:06,230 --> 02:21:11,230
It is awesome.
And that watch is 12 grand and he's 

3115
02:21:11,230 --> 02:21:11,230
making 50 of them.
I believe it.

3116
02:21:11,230 --> 02:21:16,031
Yeah.
He tried to use the face in that vantaa 

3117
02:21:16,031 --> 02:21:16,031
black shit.

3118
02:21:16,031 --> 02:21:17,750
What does that.
Vanna black is the darkest.

3119
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:20,360
The blackest black that has ever 
existed.

3120
02:21:20,380 --> 02:21:21,800
Oh,
I saw they painted a building with.

3121
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:24,530
It looks like it looks like a negative 
space.

3122
02:21:24,531 --> 02:21:25,910
Dude.
Get a picture of vanna black.

3123
02:21:25,911 --> 02:21:29,960
It doesn't look real and it's the most 
black that,

3124
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:30,920
that,
that.

3125
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:35,690
That's something painted in atlanta.
Black so black that it absorbs all light

3126
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:40,780
and you can't even wait to see anything.
Can you paint a car in that you could 

3127
02:21:40,780 --> 02:21:41,990
accept in the environmentally?
It's not.

3128
02:21:41,991 --> 02:21:43,510
It's not a good thing.
Hey,

3129
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:48,520
fuck the penguins or whoever's gonna die
apparently to makes black g wagon,

3130
02:21:49,790 --> 02:21:51,140
bro.
Fuck bro.

3131
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:55,310
I need my g wagon ventilation in the 
event of black friend.

3132
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:59,030
The black has the vantage has vantaa 
black in.

3133
02:21:59,031 --> 02:22:01,670
Of course it does.
You'll see it's $95,000.

3134
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:05,390
And the vantaa black is just the black 
background.

3135
02:22:05,570 --> 02:22:07,250
When you said $95,000.

3136
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:10,910
My balls made my balls go like this.
They went,

3137
02:22:11,420 --> 02:22:16,420
bro.
They got watches that are a million 

3138
02:22:16,420 --> 02:22:16,420
dollars.
What does a million dollars?

3139
02:22:16,420 --> 02:22:16,850
You can buy a million dollar watches 
right now.

3140
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:18,910
300 bucks.
G shock do it.

3141
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:21,880
There's a watch called the jacob a 
stratta mia.

3142
02:22:22,090 --> 02:22:26,610
That is like wearing like a sapphire 
fishbowl on your fucking hand.

3143
02:22:27,150 --> 02:22:29,760
I swear.
it's the craziest shit you've ever seen.

3144
02:22:29,761 --> 02:22:33,690
So rIdiculous.
It's like liberace.

3145
02:22:33,691 --> 02:22:38,580
The oil sheet.
That jamie top right picture there.

3146
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:41,490
See this as a gold case?
That's a sapphire case.

3147
02:22:42,090 --> 02:22:47,090
The whole thing.
So what if you bump into something and 

3148
02:22:47,090 --> 02:22:48,000
shattered her hand?
That's so stupid.

3149
02:22:48,001 --> 02:22:49,620
You are in a glass,
not glass.

3150
02:22:49,621 --> 02:22:54,180
it's sapphire cinderella mother.
The whole case is milled from a block of

3151
02:22:54,181 --> 02:22:57,630
sapphire case can go fuck itself.
Seriously.

3152
02:22:57,720 --> 02:23:01,080
It's a million dollars.
You deserve.

3153
02:23:01,890 --> 02:23:04,970
You deserve that thing to break.
That's crazy looking.

3154
02:23:05,010 --> 02:23:05,940
It's hilarious,
right?

3155
02:23:05,941 --> 02:23:06,960
That's a million dollar watch.

3156
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:08,650
Yeah,
earth is the earth.

3157
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:12,600
The or the planets are spinning around,
spinning around and you can find a video

3158
02:23:12,601 --> 02:23:13,770
of it thing.
It's nuts.

3159
02:23:13,830 --> 02:23:15,240
Look at the stars.
Oh,

3160
02:23:15,241 --> 02:23:17,430
it's kinda like a role of you drove your
rolls royce.

3161
02:23:17,490 --> 02:23:19,080
It would match our wash.
You'd be like,

3162
02:23:19,081 --> 02:23:19,640
what?
What?

3163
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:24,680
You could coordinate this guy with your 
starfield ceiling to dan is a small 

3164
02:23:24,900 --> 02:23:29,900
earth that's crazy and it literally has 
the continents and silver and then some 

3165
02:23:30,211 --> 02:23:33,270
blue star thing.
What Is the water made out of?

3166
02:23:33,271 --> 02:23:38,271
You think scott would be like,
I'm gonna die of something.

3167
02:23:39,661 --> 02:23:43,500
But then there's a diamond,
a son on the other side of my god,

3168
02:23:43,501 --> 02:23:47,250
there's a ball diamond ball that spins.
Some of them have different,

3169
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:48,050
different,
uh,

3170
02:23:48,140 --> 02:23:50,490
stuff on them too.
That's just $1.

3171
02:23:50,491 --> 02:23:52,550
You have to be to be sporting a million 
dollar water.

3172
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:53,560
That one's got out and checked.

3173
02:23:53,570 --> 02:23:58,570
The town's got a central.
Let me check the time on my million 

3174
02:23:58,570 --> 02:23:59,430
dollar mother fucking watch.
It's crazy,

3175
02:23:59,431 --> 02:24:00,390
right?
That's crazy.

3176
02:24:00,391 --> 02:24:05,391
Yeah.
There's some rich people doing some 

3177
02:24:05,391 --> 02:24:07,491
really,
really weird rich people things right 

3178
02:24:07,491 --> 02:24:07,491
now.
That seems preposterous.

3179
02:24:07,491 --> 02:24:08,610
That thing with all the diamonds on the 
baguette diamonds,

3180
02:24:08,910 --> 02:24:10,800
that's like some steam,
punk,

3181
02:24:10,830 --> 02:24:13,470
futuristic,
but like,

3182
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:14,850
it's,
it's weird.

3183
02:24:14,851 --> 02:24:18,060
It's even more so than you know,
cars.

3184
02:24:18,061 --> 02:24:19,530
It's like because a car,
it's like,

3185
02:24:19,531 --> 02:24:20,760
okay,
you got a thousand dollar car,

3186
02:24:20,761 --> 02:24:22,540
kept $10,000,
car $100,000

3187
02:24:22,541 --> 02:24:26,400
car,
but when you zoom in really close,

3188
02:24:26,490 --> 02:24:27,970
that's the computer version because 
that's not,

3189
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:28,950
oh,
it's cgi,

3190
02:24:28,951 --> 02:24:32,400
but that is pretty much what you get to 
see the astrological signs there.

3191
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:37,520
Oh my god.
What is that red made out of that amber 

3192
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:37,950
or something?
Oh,

3193
02:24:37,951 --> 02:24:39,990
probably ruby.
The sons of ruby.

3194
02:24:40,060 --> 02:24:45,060
It's probably ruby.
The sun's probably a yellow diamond 

3195
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:48,300
motherfucker.
That is incredible.

3196
02:24:49,140 --> 02:24:50,580
I don't get it,
but I get it.

3197
02:24:50,770 --> 02:24:55,770
I mean,
you must be able to appreciate that 

3198
02:24:55,770 --> 02:24:57,450
someone is making a machine that fits in
a little fish bowl on your wrist.

3199
02:24:57,690 --> 02:25:02,320
Look at that dragon and look.
I mean look on top of the crazy artistry

3200
02:25:02,340 --> 02:25:05,190
of this and the ridiculous price and the
jewels and all that stuff.

3201
02:25:05,460 --> 02:25:08,790
The mathematics of that machine work 
that is not.

3202
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:13,140
That's not just like that for nothing.
that does like moon phase.

3203
02:25:13,350 --> 02:25:16,320
You know the what sign astrological sign
is.

3204
02:25:16,321 --> 02:25:20,340
There is an actual function.
look at that one with the dragon in it.

3205
02:25:20,580 --> 02:25:25,580
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Don't say something that come out of a 

3206
02:25:25,580 --> 02:25:25,580
little kid's gumball machine.
So crazy.

3207
02:25:25,580 --> 02:25:26,290
Right?
Go scroll up.

3208
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:28,360
That's amazing.
Look and scroll up.

3209
02:25:28,420 --> 02:25:31,270
The other images though that they had 
those three watches together.

3210
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:34,690
Do you ever look how good those things 
look?

3211
02:25:34,691 --> 02:25:39,691
I mean that is.
That is a crazy thing to have on your 

3212
02:25:39,691 --> 02:25:39,691
arm.

3213
02:25:39,691 --> 02:25:39,691
It's so crazy,
right?

3214
02:25:39,691 --> 02:25:42,760
That that's a million dollars and if you
see someone wearing one in person,

3215
02:25:42,761 --> 02:25:44,260
it's big.
It's,

3216
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:47,510
it's like,
it's like the size of that back.

3217
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:50,020
Any lid,
a coffee mug and your hands.

3218
02:25:51,370 --> 02:25:55,840
It's so big.
They're actually.

3219
02:25:55,841 --> 02:26:00,841
I mean you'd be shocked at what people 
are doing with certain with machinery 

3220
02:26:01,481 --> 02:26:03,790
and wanton mechanical watchmaker would 
be received.

3221
02:26:03,820 --> 02:26:06,550
It's like the fight against friction is 
the whole thing,

3222
02:26:06,551 --> 02:26:11,551
right?
you've got this tiny little spring and 

3223
02:26:11,551 --> 02:26:11,551
you need to get as much power out of it 
as possible.

3224
02:26:11,551 --> 02:26:16,111
So they engineered these like micro 
grams of friction out of this stuff.

3225
02:26:16,301 --> 02:26:21,301
So they.
They are work star trek and a whoa,

3226
02:26:23,351 --> 02:26:24,470
that's pretty.
Yeah,

3227
02:26:24,670 --> 02:26:29,670
I think that is the lid liquids closed.
It looks like a star trek communicator 

3228
02:26:29,670 --> 02:26:34,020
now.
How much does something like that go 

3229
02:26:34,020 --> 02:26:34,020
for?
Probably 50 or 60.

3230
02:26:34,020 --> 02:26:34,020
Oh,
sorry,

3231
02:26:34,020 --> 02:26:34,180
I was going to get higher.

3232
02:26:34,210 --> 02:26:39,210
I was going to get 75.
I think you can get different versions 

3233
02:26:39,210 --> 02:26:39,210
of it that are.
Don't hold me to the price.

3234
02:26:39,210 --> 02:26:43,681
It's expensive,
but whAt do you think it cost jamie 

3235
02:26:43,681 --> 02:26:43,730
tayga?
Yeah,

3236
02:26:43,800 --> 02:26:45,940
that's what I was saying.
70th five.

3237
02:26:45,970 --> 02:26:47,850
That's top.
The top article should have it.

3238
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:49,600
The hoa dinky article usually has a 
price.

3239
02:26:49,630 --> 02:26:51,280
If you scroll dowN to the bottom of that
article,

3240
02:26:51,340 --> 02:26:52,960
it should have it.
That's it.

3241
02:26:52,961 --> 02:26:57,961
Closed right there.
So you can read the time when it's 

3242
02:26:57,961 --> 02:26:58,210
closed on that watch.
It's eight.

3243
02:26:58,630 --> 02:27:01,840
A 27?
Yeah.

3244
02:27:02,260 --> 02:27:03,670
And what does it look like when it's 
closed?

3245
02:27:03,850 --> 02:27:04,630
Go,
go up.

3246
02:27:04,660 --> 02:27:05,940
That's close.
That's closed.

3247
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:11,250
Yeah.
And then that's another version of 

3248
02:27:11,250 --> 02:27:13,150
different tops.
The clear top or the the or the metallic

3249
02:27:13,151 --> 02:27:16,000
one and then there's a carbon back and 
that's a pretty watch.

3250
02:27:16,001 --> 02:27:17,320
Yeah,
it's pretty looking.

3251
02:27:17,380 --> 02:27:20,320
If you scroll all the way down,
it should say the price.

3252
02:27:20,350 --> 02:27:22,700
No,
68,000.

3253
02:27:23,230 --> 02:27:24,850
There you go.
Fucking expensive.

3254
02:27:25,360 --> 02:27:27,430
It's.
There's some wild stuff.

3255
02:27:27,431 --> 02:27:32,431
There's a company called h y t that is,
that makes watches that have a liquid 

3256
02:27:32,431 --> 02:27:36,871
that moves around and it tells you the 
time based on like almost like a 

3257
02:27:36,871 --> 02:27:37,810
thermometer.
The liquid goes up to this level.

3258
02:27:38,380 --> 02:27:40,480
There's a watched by a company called 
devin,

3259
02:27:40,540 --> 02:27:44,860
d e v o n that's a belt driven watch 
where you have like a series of conveyor

3260
02:27:44,861 --> 02:27:46,230
belts on your wrist.
Yeah,

3261
02:27:46,260 --> 02:27:48,190
there's the h yet.
So the green,

3262
02:27:48,850 --> 02:27:51,910
the green liquid goes around the dial.

3263
02:27:55,260 --> 02:27:59,350
It's like a nuclear ooze that like flows
through the dial.

3264
02:27:59,510 --> 02:28:00,620
Yeah,
it,

3265
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:03,310
it changes depending upon the time.
Yeah,

3266
02:28:03,490 --> 02:28:04,150
yeah.
Yeah.

3267
02:28:04,151 --> 02:28:05,440
So that,
that goo,

3268
02:28:05,441 --> 02:28:10,441
like it flows.
Go back to the one with the green goop 

3269
02:28:10,441 --> 02:28:13,210
on the top left there.
So fills up around the dial.

3270
02:28:13,211 --> 02:28:15,850
And then is when it goes all the way 
around.

3271
02:28:15,851 --> 02:28:17,500
Is it a minute?
Ain't no,

3272
02:28:17,501 --> 02:28:20,150
it's an hour.
It's awesome.

3273
02:28:20,151 --> 02:28:21,100
Right?
That's amazing.

3274
02:28:21,170 --> 02:28:24,110
Look down and that's how you know where 
it is in the outline and then it had,

3275
02:28:24,130 --> 02:28:26,550
it had a typical hour hand.
yeah.

3276
02:28:26,580 --> 02:28:30,060
And then this one,
it flows around the skull to food.

3277
02:28:30,260 --> 02:28:32,900
You actually have something like that 
cost 100 grand or something.

3278
02:28:33,370 --> 02:28:35,420
Actual rose is actually sponsored by 
them.

3279
02:28:35,590 --> 02:28:36,920
Believe it or not.
It works,

3280
02:28:36,921 --> 02:28:38,180
right?
It's on brand for him.

3281
02:28:38,210 --> 02:28:41,180
I think this is about a hundred grand.
So when you say sponsored,

3282
02:28:41,181 --> 02:28:44,110
like what do they do to get axle to 
where you just were?

3283
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:44,960
Yeah,
he wears one.

3284
02:28:44,961 --> 02:28:49,961
Yeah.
I follow these dumb watch spotter 

3285
02:28:49,961 --> 02:28:50,390
instagram accounts and they sell for 
upwards of 50,000.

3286
02:28:50,391 --> 02:28:52,310
So I think,
I think it's more than that.

3287
02:28:53,990 --> 02:28:54,970
$50.
Seventy five.

3288
02:28:55,400 --> 02:28:56,420
They're expensive,
man.

3289
02:28:56,520 --> 02:29:00,820
It's David Cross selling watches.
Two hundred and $85,000

3290
02:29:01,010 --> 02:29:03,980
to eight slash three particular ultra 
light.

3291
02:29:03,981 --> 02:29:06,080
High end model.
Which one's that one?

3292
02:29:06,470 --> 02:29:07,240
But it's,
there's,

3293
02:29:07,360 --> 02:29:09,260
you know,
there's some materials in this stuff.

3294
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:13,960
They use crazy forged carbon.
There was um,

3295
02:29:14,360 --> 02:29:16,770
95 grand used for a skull one.
Yep.

3296
02:29:16,850 --> 02:29:17,690
Ooh,
let me see that.

3297
02:29:18,410 --> 02:29:19,730
that's pretty.
Yeah,

3298
02:29:20,040 --> 02:29:21,380
they're real crazy.
I mean it's,

3299
02:29:21,410 --> 02:29:23,330
you can Get lost in this stuff.
I mean the,

3300
02:29:23,340 --> 02:29:28,340
the machinery of it and the materials.
do you think the liquid is that goes 

3301
02:29:28,340 --> 02:29:28,460
around that fuck?
I don't know.

3302
02:29:28,461 --> 02:29:30,630
They may have a different picture with a
different liquid,

3303
02:29:30,631 --> 02:29:32,720
so that's how the minutes go.
Yeah,

3304
02:29:32,810 --> 02:29:34,910
and then there was an hour is so crazy.

3305
02:29:35,740 --> 02:29:38,430
Press that.
Let's see if this works.

3306
02:29:39,710 --> 02:29:41,690
Here's the liquors.
The liquid going.

3307
02:29:43,220 --> 02:29:46,820
So cool.
That is fucking dope.

3308
02:29:48,130 --> 02:29:50,360
I love the fact that people are so 
creative.

3309
02:29:50,750 --> 02:29:54,950
They can figure out how to do things 
like this on something like a watch.

3310
02:29:54,980 --> 02:29:57,590
So you look at the blue,
the red googling around the skull.

3311
02:29:58,730 --> 02:30:00,770
Isn't that awesome?
Oh my god.

3312
02:30:01,550 --> 02:30:03,430
I'm in love with it.
It's so cool.

3313
02:30:03,431 --> 02:30:08,431
it's amazing.
I'm in love with this and then look at 

3314
02:30:08,431 --> 02:30:09,230
it goes back,
but it goes back quick.

3315
02:30:09,231 --> 02:30:12,240
It goes back quick and resets.
Oh yeah.

3316
02:30:12,810 --> 02:30:15,710
Fill up when it goes back.
Oh you got to be kidding.

3317
02:30:17,020 --> 02:30:19,010
Oh my god.
There's some really next level,

3318
02:30:19,011 --> 02:30:23,450
like there's bellows and pumps and it's 
like pumping liquid around dude.

3319
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:25,040
Right?
I had no idea.

3320
02:30:25,080 --> 02:30:30,080
Yeah,
I had no idea people were doing this to 

3321
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:32,171
other people are doing crazy things that
is fucking like on a more.

3322
02:30:32,420 --> 02:30:33,740
So that's really crazy.
He'S like,

3323
02:30:33,741 --> 02:30:36,680
so I have a watch that is called the 
perpetual calendar.

3324
02:30:36,681 --> 02:30:39,080
Which is like a traditional complicated 
watch,

3325
02:30:39,081 --> 02:30:42,680
so it does day of the week,
date of the month,

3326
02:30:43,070 --> 02:30:45,650
month of the year,
four digit year,

3327
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:48,530
moon phase,
power reserve.

3328
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:51,680
Okay.
And the time obviously.

3329
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:55,420
And it has all of those functions and 
you,

3330
02:30:55,421 --> 02:30:57,800
if you keep the watch running,
you know it's a mechanical,

3331
02:30:57,801 --> 02:31:00,350
you gotta keep it wound up.
if you keep it wound and running,

3332
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:05,680
it will be accurate for all of those 
things without needing any adjustment 

3333
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:09,020
for about 300 years.
Like leap years.

3334
02:31:09,050 --> 02:31:10,910
How many days are in the month that 
you're in?

3335
02:31:10,911 --> 02:31:12,530
Like all of that shit.
Yeah.

3336
02:31:12,531 --> 02:31:15,110
I iwc propecia,
big pilot,

3337
02:31:15,111 --> 02:31:16,310
perpetual calendar.

3338
02:31:18,550 --> 02:31:23,550
I'd like a watch that looks like that.
Like a classic looking either the big 

3339
02:31:23,550 --> 02:31:25,890
pilot perpetual calendar.
I liked their watches.

3340
02:31:25,891 --> 02:31:30,891
Iwc,
they make beautiful watches that are 

3341
02:31:30,891 --> 02:31:33,780
like that right there.
To me that's like a perfect look and 

3342
02:31:33,780 --> 02:31:33,780
walk.
I like normal location.

3343
02:31:33,780 --> 02:31:36,340
Big pilot.
Uh yeah,

3344
02:31:36,470 --> 02:31:39,540
like one.
Is it orange?

3345
02:31:39,541 --> 02:31:41,310
Hands down.
That's it.

3346
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:43,860
But go down one on the left,
bottom left or yeah,

3347
02:31:43,861 --> 02:31:45,750
that's the one.
Wow.

3348
02:31:45,780 --> 02:31:47,660
So it does.
It's got a lot going on.

3349
02:31:48,210 --> 02:31:51,690
That's the one I have that's a beautiful
wife and it's big.

3350
02:31:51,691 --> 02:31:53,880
It's big and chunky and heavy,
but you see it scott,

3351
02:31:53,910 --> 02:31:56,700
four digit year and then the month at 
the,

3352
02:31:56,760 --> 02:32:00,150
at the 6:00
Mark Day of the week and the second hand

3353
02:32:00,151 --> 02:32:05,151
at 9:00
and then the date and the power reserve 

3354
02:32:05,151 --> 02:32:09,201
at the 3:00
and if you keep that running that'll 

3355
02:32:09,201 --> 02:32:09,870
give you june,
third,

3356
02:32:10,050 --> 02:32:13,640
2018 friday,
you know,

3357
02:32:13,740 --> 02:32:14,370
whatever.

3358
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:18,450
Automatically it knows all the math.
Hundreds of years.

3359
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:19,560
Wow.
Crazy.

3360
02:32:19,561 --> 02:32:20,880
Right.
All you have to do is keep it running,

3361
02:32:20,910 --> 02:32:25,910
just keep it running so you have to just
put it in a perpetual watch machine 

3362
02:32:25,910 --> 02:32:27,420
where it or where it.
Fortunately I like wearing it and it has

3363
02:32:27,421 --> 02:32:32,421
an eight day power reserve,
so if I wear it one day out of every 

3364
02:32:32,421 --> 02:32:32,421
eight days,
it's great.

3365
02:32:32,421 --> 02:32:33,810
Oh,
so it has a battery assist?

3366
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:34,200
No,
no.

3367
02:32:34,201 --> 02:32:36,510
The sprinG.
We'll keep going for eighT days.

3368
02:32:36,511 --> 02:32:37,020
Yeah,
yeah.

3369
02:32:37,021 --> 02:32:42,021
Eight days.
And then you see in the the inneR gauge 

3370
02:32:42,021 --> 02:32:44,370
at the 3:00
position it says days seven,

3371
02:32:44,371 --> 02:32:44,790
six,
five,

3372
02:32:44,791 --> 02:32:45,180
four,
three,

3373
02:32:45,181 --> 02:32:45,720
two,
one.

3374
02:32:46,410 --> 02:32:48,330
This one's dead.
It's an emptY gauge,

3375
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:53,360
but normally it stays up by the des in 
days when it's full and it shows you how

3376
02:32:53,641 --> 02:32:54,600
much is left.
This one,

3377
02:32:54,601 --> 02:32:56,550
this watch has a.
Has a fuel gauge as well.

3378
02:32:57,270 --> 02:32:58,710
This is mechanical.
Yes.

3379
02:32:58,711 --> 02:33:01,050
He looked right down here at the 7:00
position.

3380
02:33:01,051 --> 02:33:04,410
That watch has a fuel gauge as well.
Very helpful.

3381
02:33:04,411 --> 02:33:09,411
It's crazy.
My favorite feature and mechanical 

3382
02:33:09,411 --> 02:33:09,411
watches.
The fuel gauge,

3383
02:33:09,411 --> 02:33:11,040
is that an actual fuel icon?
It looks like.

3384
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:12,170
Kind of.
Yeah,

3385
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:13,380
it does.
Kinda look like.

3386
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:15,330
wow.
Wow.

3387
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:17,340
That's dope.
So watches.

3388
02:33:17,670 --> 02:33:20,790
I have a podcast about all this called 
watch and listen with.

3389
02:33:21,050 --> 02:33:23,670
I do it with a watchmaker who like to 
take shit apart.

3390
02:33:23,671 --> 02:33:24,750
Cameron weiss,
he's the man.

3391
02:33:24,870 --> 02:33:29,870
Watches are connected to like extreme 
materialism and a lot of people's eyes 

3392
02:33:29,870 --> 02:33:29,870
like they don't.
Totally.

3393
02:33:29,870 --> 02:33:31,130
Yeah.
It's one of those thinGs like,

3394
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:32,950
oh god,
you're in The watches.

3395
02:33:32,960 --> 02:33:34,860
Like he must be a do.
Totally.

3396
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:40,000
It's a faiR argument because watches are
so are used as trophies and flashy shit 

3397
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:40,890
and.
But they're also cool.

3398
02:33:40,950 --> 02:33:41,940
They're all so cool.
Yeah.

3399
02:33:41,941 --> 02:33:45,930
it's like that is true.
I feel with cars.

3400
02:33:46,650 --> 02:33:47,040
I mean,
look,

3401
02:33:47,041 --> 02:33:52,041
if you is every person who buys a 
ferrari,

3402
02:33:52,951 --> 02:33:57,951
la ferrari,
is every one of those people a whole a 

3403
02:33:57,951 --> 02:33:57,951
douche?
No,

3404
02:33:57,951 --> 02:33:59,820
some are and some are represented.
The ultimate enthusiasts.

3405
02:33:59,850 --> 02:34:03,810
Seventy five might be fifth now it might
be 50.

3406
02:34:03,870 --> 02:34:08,870
It could be know there's,
there's enthusiastic and there's dishes 

3407
02:34:08,870 --> 02:34:08,870
in everything,
in everything.

3408
02:34:09,110 --> 02:34:14,110
And the thing is those,
there's a reason why those things are 

3409
02:34:14,110 --> 02:34:14,110
highly coveted because they're fucking 
amazing.

3410
02:34:14,110 --> 02:34:15,360
Yeah.
You know that watch,

3411
02:34:15,420 --> 02:34:17,910
I don't want a million dollar watch,
but that watches the shit.

3412
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:17,980
I

3413
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:20,170
would never wear it if I had to do it.
If you're in beverly hills,

3414
02:34:20,171 --> 02:34:25,171
go in the store.
The jacobs store in beverly hills 

3415
02:34:25,171 --> 02:34:26,620
frisked through the fucking tsa thing on
here,

3416
02:34:26,621 --> 02:34:27,440
right?
Yeah.

3417
02:34:27,490 --> 02:34:30,360
I'm sure they must be really worried 
about people walking into that store and

3418
02:34:30,361 --> 02:34:35,361
you got to get buzzed in and do you 
really fuck you dude.

3419
02:34:37,631 --> 02:34:41,660
You could smash and grab like $6,000,000
in appraising.

3420
02:34:41,740 --> 02:34:45,160
Somebody just did that recently in 
england.

3421
02:34:45,161 --> 02:34:48,730
they smashed and grabbed a watch store 
with machetes.

3422
02:34:49,540 --> 02:34:54,540
Yeah,
because you know there's this thiNg in 

3423
02:34:54,540 --> 02:34:54,540
england going on right now.
I don't know if you know it,

3424
02:34:54,540 --> 02:34:58,330
but they have london haS for the first 
time ever passed the United States,

3425
02:34:58,390 --> 02:35:03,390
uh,
passed a New York city rather for the 

3426
02:35:03,390 --> 02:35:03,390
most murders.
Really?

3427
02:35:03,390 --> 02:35:08,060
Yeah.
Ever since he was a stabbing each other 

3428
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:08,060
and stabbing each other.
So the london mayor,

3429
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:12,780
mayor of london on twitter wrote a tweet
that has been getting him tortured 

3430
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:15,670
online saying there is no reason to have
a knife.

3431
02:35:15,950 --> 02:35:18,760
If I saw that knife,
you will be pr.

3432
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:19,990
We catch you,
you,

3433
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:22,220
you regular guy.
Regular guy.

3434
02:35:22,630 --> 02:35:24,580
I open packages.
I carry a knife.

3435
02:35:24,700 --> 02:35:26,620
I want to cut a piece of rope.
I have a knife on me.

3436
02:35:26,621 --> 02:35:27,040
He said,
okay.

3437
02:35:27,041 --> 02:35:28,090
Not anymore.
No.

3438
02:35:28,091 --> 02:35:33,091
In london,
this guy saying if you have a knife and 

3439
02:35:33,091 --> 02:35:35,281
you're caught with one,
you'll be prosecuted to the fullest 

3440
02:35:35,281 --> 02:35:37,981
eXtent of the law.
And of course United States were going 

3441
02:35:37,981 --> 02:35:37,981
crazY over here.
Like,

3442
02:35:37,981 --> 02:35:38,200
oh.
So I thought it was a gun problem.

3443
02:35:38,270 --> 02:35:40,240
That was a fucking gun problem.
You got a band?

3444
02:35:40,270 --> 02:35:41,200
Nice.
What's next?

3445
02:35:41,710 --> 02:35:43,880
Fucking scissors you can do.
What are you going?

3446
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:46,060
Where's this going to end?
Yeah,

3447
02:35:46,470 --> 02:35:51,470
I do have to think that.
I think we have a little bit of a gun 

3448
02:35:51,470 --> 02:35:51,730
problem.
We definitely have an issue problem.

3449
02:35:51,731 --> 02:35:56,731
We definitely have something going on,
but this smash and grab these 

3450
02:35:56,731 --> 02:35:56,731
motherfuckers use machetes.

3451
02:35:56,731 --> 02:35:58,570
That's gangster gangster knew nobody had
a gun.

3452
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:02,590
He tried to use a machete and dudes 
behind the counter of shotguns.

3453
02:36:02,950 --> 02:36:05,170
Real problem.
It was a homemade machete,

3454
02:36:05,410 --> 02:36:07,600
a homemade machete.
Well,

3455
02:36:09,050 --> 02:36:14,050
how do they know It's homemade?
Because they caught the guy that says 

3456
02:36:14,050 --> 02:36:16,750
I'll made caught up in my house right 
here.

3457
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:20,680
Good for good for you.
I guess he didn't get away.

3458
02:36:20,830 --> 02:36:22,420
No good attempt.
Yeah.

3459
02:36:22,421 --> 02:36:24,010
But it's again,
watches,

3460
02:36:24,190 --> 02:36:27,970
like when you think about something 
small like jewelry and watches,

3461
02:36:27,971 --> 02:36:32,971
something that's this little on 
something you fit in your hand can be 

3462
02:36:32,971 --> 02:36:34,210
worth a million dollars.
It's only things in life where something

3463
02:36:34,211 --> 02:36:36,550
that fits in your hand is worth a 
million dollars.

3464
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:39,580
Yeah.
And there's also a lot of the mainstream

3465
02:36:39,610 --> 02:36:43,210
brands like rolex and whatever,
there's a lot of um,

3466
02:36:43,730 --> 02:36:47,680
a false prop up of the value.
They intentionally,

3467
02:36:47,681 --> 02:36:52,681
you know,
they don't build as many submariners as 

3468
02:36:52,681 --> 02:36:53,500
they could because they want to drive 
the market up demand up and it keeps the

3469
02:36:53,501 --> 02:36:57,310
used values high and there's this,
there's an entire ecosystem,

3470
02:36:57,430 --> 02:37:02,430
you know,
based on new and used watch values and 

3471
02:37:02,430 --> 02:37:03,480
yeah,
well I think the craziest value thing in

3472
02:37:03,490 --> 02:37:08,490
anything of like high end things that 
people love is diamonds because they're 

3473
02:37:08,490 --> 02:37:09,040
not even really that rare anymore.

3474
02:37:09,070 --> 02:37:14,070
It didn't.
I just read you can make them in the 

3475
02:37:14,070 --> 02:37:14,070
microwave now.
It's not a thing.

3476
02:37:14,070 --> 02:37:14,070
I'm like,
I read an article,

3477
02:37:14,070 --> 02:37:14,190
they figured out how to make diamonds 
and I'm like,

3478
02:37:15,460 --> 02:37:20,460
how do they do that?
The same way they can make them in a 

3479
02:37:20,460 --> 02:37:21,080
lap.
Someone figured out a process carbon and

3480
02:37:21,150 --> 02:37:22,040
keep,
you know,

3481
02:37:22,041 --> 02:37:24,140
when they make them in a lab,
it's really interesting.

3482
02:37:24,410 --> 02:37:27,530
I don't think they can make really big 
ones in a lab yet.

3483
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:29,870
I think they're gonna only make like one
or two carrots.

3484
02:37:30,550 --> 02:37:35,550
I might be wrong.
I would definitely be down with getting 

3485
02:37:35,550 --> 02:37:35,550
cremated and being turned into a 
diamond.

3486
02:37:35,550 --> 02:37:40,020
Here it goes.
Scientists figured out a way to make 

3487
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:40,020
diamonds and a microphone and it could 
change the diamond industry.

3488
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:41,540
Oh shit.
It's over bitches.

3489
02:37:41,541 --> 02:37:43,400
April ninth just happened.
oh yeah.

3490
02:37:43,430 --> 02:37:46,250
I read this article and I just noticed 
now it's business insider.

3491
02:37:46,400 --> 02:37:47,990
I don't trust them.
Look at this.

3492
02:37:48,350 --> 02:37:50,840
Yeah.
Placing a tiny fragment of a diamond,

3493
02:37:50,841 --> 02:37:54,830
a carbon seat in the microwave with 
varying amounts of carbon heavy gas.

3494
02:37:55,070 --> 02:38:00,070
The result is a synthetic ethical 
diamond with the exact same structure 

3495
02:38:00,070 --> 02:38:04,451
and chemical compositions.
That diamond that came from the ground 

3496
02:38:04,451 --> 02:38:05,210
works so weLl.
Experts reportedly need machines to tell

3497
02:38:05,211 --> 02:38:10,211
the lab grown gems apart from the 
natural ones estimated by 2026.

3498
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:14,660
The number of lab made diamonds will 
skyrocket to 20 million carats.

3499
02:38:14,690 --> 02:38:17,900
So then here's the thinG,
anyone who owns a naTuRal diamond,

3500
02:38:18,460 --> 02:38:21,510
that diamond is now in the toilet or you
think so will be like,

3501
02:38:21,530 --> 02:38:22,850
this is natural.
The shit came from.

3502
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:24,380
What if they can't tell the difference 
though?

3503
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:28,040
You go to a machine like this,
motherfucker's got a machine who's got a

3504
02:38:28,041 --> 02:38:30,110
machine would want to know.
They would want to know.

3505
02:38:30,111 --> 02:38:32,720
I need to know is it machine certified 
that it came out of the ground?

3506
02:38:33,740 --> 02:38:35,220
I don't know.
Is this blood diamonds?

3507
02:38:35,250 --> 02:38:40,250
I only want blood diamonds.
I got engaged a few months ago and I 

3508
02:38:40,250 --> 02:38:44,240
should.
Thank you and I got a great deal from 

3509
02:38:44,240 --> 02:38:45,110
somebody who I nicknamed.
Blood diamond is not a blood diamond,

3510
02:38:45,111 --> 02:38:50,111
I assure you,
but I just love calling him blood and he

3511
02:38:50,550 --> 02:38:52,700
gets very upset.
Can you just fucking stop it?

3512
02:38:52,701 --> 02:38:56,180
I don't want to wear this thing around 
blood diamond.

3513
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:58,640
Yeah.
Well that's the thing too.

3514
02:38:58,641 --> 02:39:00,980
It's like they've got that business on 
lock down.

3515
02:39:00,981 --> 02:39:03,950
Do you want to prove your love and your 
commitment to the relationship?

3516
02:39:03,951 --> 02:39:05,060
Well,
you need to buy one of these.

3517
02:39:05,270 --> 02:39:08,390
You can't buy out a fucking a car.
Nope.

3518
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:11,360
You can't buy her an engagement car.
I tried to do that.

3519
02:39:11,361 --> 02:39:16,361
Actually.
I was going to propose with an 

3520
02:39:16,361 --> 02:39:16,361
engagement jeep wagon here.
That's a good move.

3521
02:39:16,361 --> 02:39:20,680
It was until they get mad at you and 
you're the one that they want the 

3522
02:39:20,680 --> 02:39:20,680
diamond show their friends.

3523
02:39:20,790 --> 02:39:23,660
Matt stepped up asap.
That clarity.

3524
02:39:24,730 --> 02:39:26,100
It's amazing.
He's tapped that.

3525
02:39:27,220 --> 02:39:29,660
Did mike step up?
Mike didn't step up.

3526
02:39:30,140 --> 02:39:32,120
Matt stepped up,
mike did step up.

3527
02:39:32,730 --> 02:39:33,810
Mike's like,
fuck dude.

3528
02:39:33,930 --> 02:39:36,180
Fucking dorm.
Dual thieves throw.

3529
02:39:36,410 --> 02:39:37,690
No thought,
really worked up,

3530
02:39:38,270 --> 02:39:39,590
bro.
Just need a cz.

3531
02:39:39,620 --> 02:39:41,690
If a girl found out that you had a fake 
diamond,

3532
02:39:43,570 --> 02:39:46,190
that was the thing that happened to an 
aunt of mine.

3533
02:39:46,630 --> 02:39:47,990
she found out she found her.
Diane was fake.

3534
02:39:48,470 --> 02:39:51,560
She was getting divorced and she went to
bring her ring in.

3535
02:39:51,590 --> 02:39:56,590
She found out it was fake.
Don trump gave someone fake diamond 

3536
02:39:56,590 --> 02:39:57,650
cufflinks.
Who was that?

3537
02:39:57,651 --> 02:40:00,050
Somebody.
Someone in business.

3538
02:40:00,051 --> 02:40:05,051
He gave him a pair of diamond cufflinks 
and he went and looked and they were 

3539
02:40:05,051 --> 02:40:05,051
fucking ccs.
If that's the case,

3540
02:40:05,051 --> 02:40:06,470
if he did that to you,
that guy's ready to fuck you.

3541
02:40:06,770 --> 02:40:08,940
He's.
He's about to go down.

3542
02:40:10,770 --> 02:40:12,860
Mueller,
mueller,

3543
02:40:13,420 --> 02:40:16,130
steam,
and right now fucking fake diamonds.

3544
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:17,670
You don't respect me,
mr.

3545
02:40:17,700 --> 02:40:18,490
To trump.
Well,

3546
02:40:18,540 --> 02:40:21,170
I don't respect you.
Jump is fake.

3547
02:40:21,270 --> 02:40:23,580
Diamond cufflinks for years.
Oh my god.

3548
02:40:23,581 --> 02:40:26,160
He's hilarious.
He's hilarious.

3549
02:40:26,310 --> 02:40:28,560
Do they shrink his hands for those 
pictures on purpose?

3550
02:40:29,490 --> 02:40:32,070
Because his hands aren't little.
Everybody was caused his hands.

3551
02:40:32,071 --> 02:40:34,020
Little.
There's something he does with his hands

3552
02:40:34,021 --> 02:40:39,021
that make them look a little.
It's like he does a lot of stuff like 

3553
02:40:39,021 --> 02:40:41,400
this is like he brings a little in 
proportion to his head,

3554
02:40:41,401 --> 02:40:45,350
which is gigantic and getting bigger.
Apparently poor.

3555
02:40:45,510 --> 02:40:46,850
He's,
he's going down now.

3556
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:48,320
When they raided his,
uh,

3557
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:50,960
his attorney's offices,
here's the thing that to,

3558
02:40:51,060 --> 02:40:53,100
in order to get all that stuff pass 
through,

3559
02:40:53,130 --> 02:40:55,320
republicans have to agree to that.
Yeah.

3560
02:40:55,350 --> 02:41:00,350
Like there'S like in order to like 
actual republicans and people that 

3561
02:41:00,350 --> 02:41:01,880
should be.
His supporters had to be a part of that.

3562
02:41:02,220 --> 02:41:07,220
Everyone that's signed,
it was an appointee of his 

3563
02:41:07,220 --> 02:41:07,220
administration.

3564
02:41:07,220 --> 02:41:09,180
He's in trouble.
If they're rating your lawyers office,

3565
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:12,660
you are so fucked.
And if it all goes down that he winds up

3566
02:41:12,661 --> 02:41:14,370
getting in trouble.
Not even for Russia,

3567
02:41:14,371 --> 02:41:16,470
but for paying off a chick that he had 
sex with.

3568
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:19,830
Imagine it's a porn chick that takes 
this whole thing down.

3569
02:41:20,190 --> 02:41:21,060
Listen man,
I need.

3570
02:41:21,090 --> 02:41:26,090
Oh justin martindale and apology.
He was saying that she's the monica 

3571
02:41:26,090 --> 02:41:26,090
lewinsky for,
for this administration.

3572
02:41:26,130 --> 02:41:27,510
Oh,
come on.

3573
02:41:27,570 --> 02:41:29,550
No way.
He's going to brush this off.

3574
02:41:29,551 --> 02:41:31,980
It's going to be nothing.
Nobody cares because everybody knows,

3575
02:41:32,070 --> 02:41:33,600
they know we did it,
so it's not.

3576
02:41:33,601 --> 02:41:35,850
It's not even a question of whether he 
did it right,

3577
02:41:36,210 --> 02:41:38,580
but it's a matter of whether or not it's
legal.

3578
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:39,540
The camp.
Yeah.

3579
02:41:39,541 --> 02:41:41,840
It's a campaign finance violation 
lawyer.

3580
02:41:41,960 --> 02:41:44,570
So yeah,
that that's a campaign finance pen.

3581
02:41:44,571 --> 02:41:49,571
Then admitting to knowing about the 
payout is like obstruct admitting to 

3582
02:41:49,571 --> 02:41:49,571
obstruction.

3583
02:41:49,571 --> 02:41:53,990
It's like a whole other.
When he talked about it in that 

3584
02:41:53,990 --> 02:41:54,030
interview,
when someone caught him getting onto his

3585
02:41:54,031 --> 02:41:57,510
plane and he acknowledged the lawsuits.
Whoops.

3586
02:41:58,310 --> 02:41:59,760
Just he fucks up,
man.

3587
02:42:00,140 --> 02:42:03,930
He doesn't know how to shut the fuck up.
Not only that,

3588
02:42:03,931 --> 02:42:08,931
his whole life has been about not 
shutting the fuck up about saying 

3589
02:42:08,931 --> 02:42:11,691
whatever you want.
like that's his instincts and all of a 

3590
02:42:11,691 --> 02:42:11,691
sudden you put them in this position 
yet.

3591
02:42:11,691 --> 02:42:16,560
What's that?
I want you to be a totally different 

3592
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:16,560
thing.
Now I want you to be presidential.

3593
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:17,430
Yeah.
You've always trying to pick fights with

3594
02:42:17,431 --> 02:42:20,520
joe biden on twitter.
You're not going to change a 70 year old

3595
02:42:20,521 --> 02:42:23,430
billionaire.
You're not going to change that guy.

3596
02:42:23,431 --> 02:42:26,450
He's been told yes a thousand times a 
day floods.

3597
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:28,430
Forty years.
Do you think's gonna happen with them?

3598
02:42:28,900 --> 02:42:33,900
oh,
do you think they're going to kick them 

3599
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:33,900
out?

3600
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:33,900
Like what do you think?
Yeah,

3601
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:33,900
I don't.
I think it's not going to.

3602
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:38,830
I think it's,
I just don't see how he can make it 

3603
02:42:38,830 --> 02:42:38,830
through for years.
I don't know.

3604
02:42:38,830 --> 02:42:39,330
It's only thing one year.
Yeah,

3605
02:42:39,550 --> 02:42:42,720
it's very bad.
it's very bad.

3606
02:42:42,750 --> 02:42:47,750
While we've been going on,
Paul Ryan has announced that he's going 

3607
02:42:47,750 --> 02:42:47,750
to not seek reelection.
Oh,

3608
02:42:47,750 --> 02:42:49,530
thank god.
Paul.

3609
02:42:49,531 --> 02:42:51,420
Ryan's probably sees the writing on the 
wall.

3610
02:42:51,450 --> 02:42:52,670
Yeah.
What does that guy do?

3611
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:55,470
And apparently he had some kind of 
realistic challenger,

3612
02:42:55,560 --> 02:43:00,560
a democrat that has been really ramping 
up their campaign and he does not want 

3613
02:43:00,751 --> 02:43:03,090
to stick around to see how that's going 
to go.

3614
02:43:03,150 --> 02:43:06,360
Really does want to lose.
he doesn't want to get humiliated,

3615
02:43:06,410 --> 02:43:07,230
you know?
Wow.

3616
02:43:07,231 --> 02:43:08,070
That's what it is.
You think?

3617
02:43:08,071 --> 02:43:10,310
Or maybe he's just tired of losing it.
No way.

3618
02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:14,140
Maybe needs to get paid for all those 
fucking bribes.

3619
02:43:14,170 --> 02:43:16,990
Like now it's time saw today that uh,
the former speaker,

3620
02:43:16,991 --> 02:43:20,290
john banner is now on the board of a 
major,

3621
02:43:20,350 --> 02:43:24,260
major marijuana legalization.
Shit.

3622
02:43:24,440 --> 02:43:29,440
Got to get that paper.
How do you feel about this legalization 

3623
02:43:29,440 --> 02:43:29,440
situation?
I haTe it.

3624
02:43:29,440 --> 02:43:30,340
I hate it.
They should lock people up,

3625
02:43:31,130 --> 02:43:33,310
lock them up.
They're gettiNg high lock them up,

3626
02:43:33,340 --> 02:43:38,200
but compared to prop 2:15
compared to jet Seventeen to 18,

3627
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:41,500
what do you think about it?
Well,

3628
02:43:41,501 --> 02:43:44,140
the 30 percent sales taX,
which was inevitable,

3629
02:43:44,141 --> 02:43:47,200
but this is what I like about that.
It's still reasonable.

3630
02:43:47,320 --> 02:43:51,160
You can get high on a very small amount 
of money for a long period of time.

3631
02:43:51,850 --> 02:43:53,770
I don't think we should be complaining 
about that too.

3632
02:43:53,771 --> 02:43:58,771
I think we could show that there's a 
real benefit to legalization that 

3633
02:43:58,771 --> 02:43:58,771
benefits communities,
benefit schools,

3634
02:43:58,771 --> 02:44:00,010
firemen,
police officers,

3635
02:44:00,011 --> 02:44:02,320
whoever can get that money.
I think that's where the money should be

3636
02:44:02,321 --> 02:44:07,321
allocated and I think you could get 
billions of dollars for the state just 

3637
02:44:07,321 --> 02:44:09,310
doing that and I think that is a real 
positive aspect of legalization.

3638
02:44:09,310 --> 02:44:14,310
That might be the one thing that's going
to be the straw that breaks the camel's 

3639
02:44:14,310 --> 02:44:17,281
back across the country.
When people realize that you can make 

3640
02:44:17,281 --> 02:44:19,831
real money and that real money could be 
beneficial to things that communities 

3641
02:44:19,831 --> 02:44:21,310
need.
Plus you starve out illegal drug selling

3642
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:26,520
illegal drugs.
Sellings with the real problem has 

3643
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:26,520
always been when you make something 
illegal,

3644
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:28,000
only criminals are going to sell it.
Then you have criminal mentality.

3645
02:44:28,150 --> 02:44:33,150
You have people that have guns and gangs
and those are the people that were 

3646
02:44:33,150 --> 02:44:33,370
scared of not businesses.
Yeah.

3647
02:44:33,371 --> 02:44:35,740
If we were scared of businesses,
we'd be trying to close liquor stores.

3648
02:44:35,741 --> 02:44:38,070
Nobody gives a shit about wineries.
You know we're not.

3649
02:44:38,110 --> 02:44:39,910
Those are drugstores.
Have a winery,

3650
02:44:39,911 --> 02:44:44,911
is a drug dealer.
Are they liStened to you talking about 

3651
02:44:44,911 --> 02:44:48,660
about wine?
You just sell delicious trucks and for 

3652
02:44:48,660 --> 02:44:48,660
I'm 100 percent.
I love wine.

3653
02:44:48,660 --> 02:44:49,870
That's not my point.
My point is selling.

3654
02:44:49,910 --> 02:44:54,910
One thing should be legal.
Things should be legal and when 

3655
02:44:54,910 --> 02:44:57,721
marijuana is legal,
tax the fucking shit out of it and give 

3656
02:44:57,721 --> 02:44:57,730
that money back to the community and 
everybody benefits.

3657
02:44:57,850 --> 02:45:01,030
People like you and I who were 
responsible grown adults,

3658
02:45:01,180 --> 02:45:06,180
prepare taxes and are good people and 
we'd like to get high occasionally that 

3659
02:45:06,180 --> 02:45:10,230
we should be able to buy it with no 
worry about being locked in a fucking 

3660
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:10,990
cage and that money should go to 
schools.

3661
02:45:10,991 --> 02:45:15,991
That money should go to fix the streets.
That money should go to cops and 

3662
02:45:15,991 --> 02:45:18,631
firemen.
That's what it should go do it that 

3663
02:45:18,631 --> 02:45:18,631
makes that we know where it's being 
allocated.

3664
02:45:18,631 --> 02:45:19,120
yeah.
I have no idea.

3665
02:45:19,180 --> 02:45:20,410
No idea.
I would hope it's.

3666
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:26,280
here it goes.
I'm joining the board of anchorage 

3667
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:26,280
holdings holdings acreage.
Sorry,

3668
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:27,910
because my thinking on cannabis has 
evolved.

3669
02:45:28,010 --> 02:45:33,010
That's my man got high.
I was anti and then I got some of his 

3670
02:45:33,410 --> 02:45:36,970
good shit right here.
I'm convinced dea scheduling the drug is

3671
02:45:36,971 --> 02:45:41,971
needed so that we could do research,
help our veterans and reverse the opiod 

3672
02:45:41,971 --> 02:45:44,680
epidemic ravaging our communities.
Yes,

3673
02:45:44,770 --> 02:45:46,390
I agree man.
I would add to that.

3674
02:45:46,690 --> 02:45:49,360
Get high.
I'd say so we can get hot.

3675
02:45:49,630 --> 02:45:51,180
Put everyone out of jail.
Is there.

3676
02:45:51,310 --> 02:45:54,730
Is there evidence showing a weed reduces
opioid use?

3677
02:45:54,760 --> 02:45:55,360
It is,
right?

3678
02:45:55,720 --> 02:46:00,720
Um,
well it really depends upon how it's 

3679
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:03,511
used.
It can benefit some people with some 

3680
02:46:03,511 --> 02:46:04,330
kind of paint.
I don'T think it's realistic to say that

3681
02:46:04,331 --> 02:46:09,331
some people that are in horrible,
horrible pain would get the same 

3682
02:46:09,331 --> 02:46:10,640
reaction for marijuana to get for 
opiates.

3683
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:13,340
People with really bad burns,
for instance,

3684
02:46:13,341 --> 02:46:17,390
were there 24 slash seven addicted,
not for medical reasons.

3685
02:46:17,391 --> 02:46:20,240
I'm talking about if you're become 
addicted to,

3686
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:21,190
oh,
you know,

3687
02:46:21,410 --> 02:46:23,180
oxies,
there's better drugs,

3688
02:46:23,370 --> 02:46:24,650
there's better drugs that get you off.

3689
02:46:25,080 --> 02:46:27,200
Um,
there's quite a few that can help you.

3690
02:46:27,230 --> 02:46:32,230
Probably the most powerful in the most 
efficient is a ibogaine because no one 

3691
02:46:33,740 --> 02:46:34,950
like,
but no,

3692
02:46:34,970 --> 02:46:35,270
no,
no.

3693
02:46:35,271 --> 02:46:40,271
I began as non iowasca I was,
it is a hallucinogenic that is from 

3694
02:46:40,271 --> 02:46:44,740
south America is dimethyltryptamine.
Ibogaine is from the boga tree and it's 

3695
02:46:44,740 --> 02:46:48,490
a from breaking open the head that 
there's a book called breaking.

3696
02:46:49,490 --> 02:46:54,490
I'm sure he did,
but ibogaine is like a roof and it's 

3697
02:46:54,490 --> 02:46:56,150
something I haven't experienced.
I'm just talking out of what I've read.

3698
02:46:56,510 --> 02:47:01,510
Essentially a ruthlessly introspective 
24 hour trip that rewires the way your 

3699
02:47:03,141 --> 02:47:07,730
brain views addiction and has a high 
level of effectiveness.

3700
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:12,760
Interesting in rehabilitating people 
like just killing the desire to do 

3701
02:47:12,760 --> 02:47:14,150
opiates.
Are they doing that in America?

3702
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:15,730
Mexico,
go to Mexico.

3703
02:47:15,750 --> 02:47:17,600
Can't go to America.
It's illegal in America.

3704
02:47:17,601 --> 02:47:22,601
Of course.
Is it like a sweat lodge sherman type 

3705
02:47:22,601 --> 02:47:22,601
thing or is it a hospital?

3706
02:47:22,601 --> 02:47:24,620
Subsequent hospital type situations.
There's a.

3707
02:47:24,650 --> 02:47:27,470
My buddy ed clay runs a a,
I think he still does,

3708
02:47:27,780 --> 02:47:32,780
runs a clinic down in Mexico and he 
started it because of his experiences 

3709
02:47:32,780 --> 02:47:32,930
with pills.
He got hurt,

3710
02:47:33,230 --> 02:47:35,690
got on paIn pills and had a real hard 
time with them.

3711
02:47:35,990 --> 02:47:38,600
Went to get on ibogaine to get off the 
pain pills.

3712
02:47:38,750 --> 02:47:40,700
It worked like a charm and he was like,
holy shit,

3713
02:47:40,701 --> 02:47:45,701
I need to let people know about this.
You can get your life back and it's not 

3714
02:47:45,701 --> 02:47:47,270
something you get addicted to.
It's apparently something that hard time

3715
02:47:47,271 --> 02:47:48,310
doing it again.
Yeah.

3716
02:47:48,350 --> 02:47:49,310
Yeah.
It's like it's rough.

3717
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:50,650
Yeah.
It's like you go,

3718
02:47:50,651 --> 02:47:51,560
okay.
That was enough.

3719
02:47:52,010 --> 02:47:53,780
Like dmt.
Exactly.

3720
02:47:53,781 --> 02:47:58,781
It's one of those ones was enough.
He did it once in college and that was 

3721
02:47:58,781 --> 02:47:59,220
sufficient.
You,

3722
02:47:59,221 --> 02:48:01,190
you can get a lot out of one.
Yeah.

3723
02:48:01,420 --> 02:48:05,060
I went.
I had a plaid plaid fucking world flying

3724
02:48:05,061 --> 02:48:05,420
around.

3725
02:48:05,420 --> 02:48:07,820
It was.
It was full out of body nuts.

3726
02:48:07,900 --> 02:48:09,200
Oh yeah.
It's pretty nuts.

3727
02:48:09,230 --> 02:48:14,230
Yeah.
I think the difference in ibogaine 

3728
02:48:14,230 --> 02:48:16,601
versus dmt,
dmt is ego dissolving and very 

3729
02:48:16,601 --> 02:48:19,250
hallucinogenic and you see these amazing
visualizations.

3730
02:48:19,960 --> 02:48:21,710
I began,
seems to not have that,

3731
02:48:21,860 --> 02:48:25,940
but instead be like deeply like to the 
cellular level,

3732
02:48:25,970 --> 02:48:30,970
introspective and just an end.
there's some sort of a physical action 

3733
02:48:30,970 --> 02:48:35,801
that happens in the way your brain,
the way your brain looks at addiction 

3734
02:48:36,770 --> 02:48:40,940
changes pretty radically through it or 
it just happens.

3735
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:46,000
You should probably.
I think all of those things should be 

3736
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,311
done in places where people are going to
feel safe and where people have done it 

3737
02:48:48,311 --> 02:48:51,170
before and where people have experience 
with people that have done it before and

3738
02:48:51,530 --> 02:48:54,890
having a real center that has,
you know,

3739
02:48:54,950 --> 02:48:57,620
real professionals and medical health 
staff,

3740
02:48:57,840 --> 02:49:02,840
that's,
that's what you want and the only thing 

3741
02:49:02,840 --> 02:49:05,441
that's keeping that from happening in 
America and keeping millions and 

3742
02:49:05,441 --> 02:49:06,020
millions of people from getting off 
pills,

3743
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:08,340
companies,
drug companies,

3744
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:13,400
drug companies,
lobbying to keep all these very helpful 

3745
02:49:13,400 --> 02:49:16,611
things illegal and we're slowly but 
surely going to work them out and the 

3746
02:49:16,611 --> 02:49:16,611
way we're going to work the mouse 
through money.

3747
02:49:16,611 --> 02:49:19,440
That's why I like the fact that 
marijuana has a 30 percent tax.

3748
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:21,450
Make it 50.
I don't give a fuck.

3749
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:23,610
What's a joint?
How much does it joining?

3750
02:49:23,710 --> 02:49:27,210
A joint can get you high all day.
think about what a drink is.

3751
02:49:27,490 --> 02:49:28,410
Drink.
You go to bar,

3752
02:49:28,411 --> 02:49:29,820
you get a drink.
How much does a drink cost?

3753
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:34,020
$8.
$8 worth of weed will fuck you up.

3754
02:49:34,560 --> 02:49:36,100
many days.
Men,

3755
02:49:36,120 --> 02:49:37,140
I don't know,
about many days,

3756
02:49:37,141 --> 02:49:38,880
two days,
maybe one day.

3757
02:49:39,660 --> 02:49:41,040
How much does the job you?
Half a day.

3758
02:49:41,880 --> 02:49:45,120
If you're buying a $12.
Twenty five bucks.

3759
02:49:45,150 --> 02:49:47,850
This is 25 bucks.
This fat cigar.

3760
02:49:47,880 --> 02:49:50,580
This is odd father.
That will put you on pluto.

3761
02:49:50,910 --> 02:49:55,910
You'll be over there with david bowie.
It was $25 last month and now it's $33 a

3762
02:49:57,781 --> 02:50:00,660
shot of macallan.
Those well over 25 probably at any bar.

3763
02:50:00,740 --> 02:50:01,900
That's it is.
He's right.

3764
02:50:02,260 --> 02:50:03,030
All right,
fine.

3765
02:50:03,360 --> 02:50:06,000
Fine.
My taxes on my weed or good fine.

3766
02:50:06,030 --> 02:50:11,030
thank you.
I 10 years I've been buying legal weed 

3767
02:50:11,030 --> 02:50:13,941
and all of a sudden I want to buy 
illegal weed because the taxes and you 

3768
02:50:13,941 --> 02:50:14,800
just talked me guilted me even back into
legal weed.

3769
02:50:14,830 --> 02:50:16,950
I'm happy to pay it and I think that 
it's.

3770
02:50:17,170 --> 02:50:17,600
I,
you know,

3771
02:50:17,610 --> 02:50:20,240
I,
I understand you.

3772
02:50:20,280 --> 02:50:21,060
I get it,
I get it,

3773
02:50:21,300 --> 02:50:24,210
but what I'm saying money.
No you're not,

3774
02:50:24,211 --> 02:50:27,000
but some people would.
But I'm saying the money if it goes to a

3775
02:50:27,001 --> 02:50:32,001
good cause,
if we really can change the way people 

3776
02:50:32,001 --> 02:50:32,730
perceive drugs because it's not.
There's not a war on drugs.

3777
02:50:32,731 --> 02:50:37,731
That is a lie.
There's drugs everywhere they're 

3778
02:50:37,731 --> 02:50:37,920
prescribed.
You can get them into the drug store,

3779
02:50:37,980 --> 02:50:40,530
you can get them at a liquor store,
you can get drugs.

3780
02:50:40,531 --> 02:50:42,840
There's a lot of drugs.
It's just certain drugs,

3781
02:50:43,170 --> 02:50:45,090
the ones that they can't,
you know,

3782
02:50:45,170 --> 02:50:46,680
corporatize as easily.

3783
02:50:46,680 --> 02:50:50,290
So the way to get it in is not through 
the corporations influence,

3784
02:50:50,291 --> 02:50:53,850
but through the influences,
the consumer of the consumer to consumer

3785
02:50:53,851 --> 02:50:58,851
paying exorbitant amount of taxes on 
these things willingly is going to 

3786
02:50:58,851 --> 02:50:59,190
change the opinion.
You know,

3787
02:50:59,340 --> 02:51:00,510
I like weed.
Being legal.

3788
02:51:00,570 --> 02:51:02,910
I'll pay the fucking tax.
I will.

3789
02:51:02,970 --> 02:51:04,290
There we go.
I was just curious.

3790
02:51:04,291 --> 02:51:06,540
I mean,
I look selfishly,

3791
02:51:06,810 --> 02:51:11,810
totally selfishly my own benefit.
I as a guy who jumped through the hoops 

3792
02:51:13,201 --> 02:51:18,201
and got a $40 medical card,
was happy to have it be called medicine 

3793
02:51:18,570 --> 02:51:21,930
and get it and have it legally and not 
pay taxes on it.

3794
02:51:22,290 --> 02:51:26,460
Now it seems like it's the same except 
I'm paying the tax on it.

3795
02:51:26,490 --> 02:51:31,490
It is the same,
but it's progress because the money's 

3796
02:51:31,490 --> 02:51:31,490
going into community.
I hope.

3797
02:51:31,490 --> 02:51:32,310
I hope if it is,
let's find out where it goes.

3798
02:51:32,530 --> 02:51:33,480
Let's say a guest.

3799
02:51:34,290 --> 02:51:39,290
I hope it goes towards law enforcement.
I hope it's divvied up between law 

3800
02:51:39,631 --> 02:51:41,520
enforcement and education.
How about that?

3801
02:51:41,910 --> 02:51:45,750
Let's hope it goes to education,
but something tells me it's not.

3802
02:51:45,840 --> 02:51:47,250
I just feel like it's going to be so 
much money.

3803
02:51:47,251 --> 02:51:49,430
Like Colorado had a gift tax money back 
to us.

3804
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:52,560
Oh,
do they really have to get a refund back

3805
02:51:52,561 --> 02:51:54,110
because there's so much money being made
by wheat.

3806
02:51:54,130 --> 02:51:56,160
That's like Alaska.
It's like the oil pipeline.

3807
02:51:56,190 --> 02:51:58,870
Exactly.
You haven't vegetative state taxes,

3808
02:51:59,490 --> 02:52:01,710
boss.
I don't know if they have negative state

3809
02:52:01,711 --> 02:52:03,820
taxes,
but I know they gave people refunds.

3810
02:52:03,830 --> 02:52:05,980
The gave people money because they made 
so

3811
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:07,870
much money on taxes.
That's awesome.

3812
02:52:07,871 --> 02:52:09,340
Fucking amazing.
That's awesome.

3813
02:52:09,341 --> 02:52:14,050
And if that happens in California,
keep my fucking 30 percent sales tax.

3814
02:52:14,080 --> 02:52:17,650
Real estate went up 14 percent since 
marijuana was legalized.

3815
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:19,690
Instead of going down,
a lot of people thought,

3816
02:52:19,691 --> 02:52:23,390
well they'll no to move out.
There's pothead.

3817
02:52:23,420 --> 02:52:25,090
It's going to be on the streets.
Nope.

3818
02:52:25,250 --> 02:52:29,170
a friend of mine wants to open a like a 
cannabis club and there's only.

3819
02:52:29,400 --> 02:52:32,140
There's a small area in the green zone 
where you can do that.

3820
02:52:32,141 --> 02:52:32,770
And I'm like,
great.

3821
02:52:32,771 --> 02:52:33,970
Here's your map of the green zone.
I go,

3822
02:52:33,980 --> 02:52:35,980
okay.
What's for sale in the green zone?

3823
02:52:36,310 --> 02:52:38,400
Nothing.
Not a single building.

3824
02:52:38,410 --> 02:52:40,720
A place where you can get high,
like publicly.

3825
02:52:41,080 --> 02:52:43,360
Yeah.
It would be like a cigar bar.

3826
02:52:43,390 --> 02:52:44,430
Yes.
Um,

3827
02:52:44,460 --> 02:52:47,950
the,
there's a lot of rules a lot and there's

3828
02:52:47,951 --> 02:52:52,951
a very restrictive of Where you can put 
it anD you absolutely under no 

3829
02:52:52,951 --> 02:52:55,660
circumstances can have a drop of alcohol
anywhere on the premises.

3830
02:52:56,180 --> 02:52:58,480
Interesting.
So if somebody comes in with a beer,

3831
02:52:58,481 --> 02:53:01,120
you're fucked.
You can't take you gotta kick them out.

3832
02:53:01,150 --> 02:53:02,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

3833
02:53:02,830 --> 02:53:05,230
Um,
but if they're in west hollywood,

3834
02:53:05,350 --> 02:53:10,350
you,
there will be places where you can go 

3835
02:53:10,350 --> 02:53:10,350
and smoke on premises.
Yeah.

3836
02:53:10,350 --> 02:53:10,420
That's going to be weird,
huh?

3837
02:53:10,680 --> 02:53:12,370
Yeah.
Go get high with a bunch of strangers.

3838
02:53:12,850 --> 02:53:15,820
It makes sense in amsterdam because it's
a walking city.

3839
02:53:15,980 --> 02:53:19,750
Then you can use your coffee shop tour,
you know,

3840
02:53:19,751 --> 02:53:21,550
to walk around the city And ground 
coffee,

3841
02:53:21,551 --> 02:53:22,950
shop to coffee shop and sight.
See.

3842
02:53:22,951 --> 02:53:24,460
And it's really nice.
Sober up.

3843
02:53:24,490 --> 02:53:29,490
But in la,
what are your driving from coffee shop 

3844
02:53:29,490 --> 02:53:29,680
to fucking come on.
Nobody walks here.

3845
02:53:29,681 --> 02:53:30,970
What are you goIng to do?
A drive car,

3846
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:36,000
it's going to be like that.
See what the railroad of good fellows 

3847
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:36,000
with the helicopters flying overhead and
he's freaking out.

3848
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:40,770
I remade that scene frame for frame and 
it got kicked off youtube because you 

3849
02:53:40,770 --> 02:53:44,131
have to use the real music and I got 
trademark infringement but I did it 

3850
02:53:44,131 --> 02:53:45,460
frame for frame with the helicopters.
You mean you did it?

3851
02:53:45,970 --> 02:53:50,500
I remade that helicopter chase you with 
me and it into for a car review.

3852
02:53:50,501 --> 02:53:55,501
I was reviewing the cadillac and I did 
the fucking thing right through the bag 

3853
02:53:55,501 --> 02:53:55,990
in and when I'm looking helicopters and 
we did the.

3854
02:53:56,020 --> 02:53:58,960
What was the problem?
You um,

3855
02:53:59,660 --> 02:54:00,820
what does that music?
Yeah,

3856
02:54:00,821 --> 02:54:02,200
the actual music.
Yeah,

3857
02:54:02,210 --> 02:54:03,640
yeah,
yeah.

3858
02:54:03,641 --> 02:54:06,970
You have to use the actual music.
Otherwise it's not rolling stones.

3859
02:54:06,971 --> 02:54:07,330
What is it?

3860
02:54:09,750 --> 02:54:11,950
It's not layla.
Layla.

3861
02:54:12,070 --> 02:54:16,450
No fucking hell.
That's whatever it is.

3862
02:54:16,451 --> 02:54:18,250
You have to use the exact music and it 
didn't work.

3863
02:54:18,370 --> 02:54:20,610
And then that got kicked off of youtube 
too bad.

3864
02:54:20,790 --> 02:54:22,330
Spends a lot of time in that.
Well,

3865
02:54:22,331 --> 02:54:27,331
they're really good at spotting 
copyright music now or anything copy 

3866
02:54:27,331 --> 02:54:27,570
written.
I thought I could get away,

3867
02:54:27,620 --> 02:54:32,620
get around it.
If I didn't monetize the video but it 

3868
02:54:32,620 --> 02:54:32,620
didn't,
you know,

3869
02:54:32,620 --> 02:54:34,870
when we get fucked,
whenever we put up a video of any nature

3870
02:54:34,871 --> 02:54:39,871
thing,
like oh a bear killing something or 

3871
02:54:39,871 --> 02:54:42,871
something like that.
All those were all bought by someone 

3872
02:54:42,871 --> 02:54:43,120
almost like patent trolls.
People put them up,

3873
02:54:43,121 --> 02:54:48,121
they just take it down and you have to 
offer him money to like stock footage 

3874
02:54:48,121 --> 02:54:48,610
companies or something.
Yeah,

3875
02:54:48,910 --> 02:54:53,910
yeah.
All that stuff gets yanked dowN off of 

3876
02:54:53,910 --> 02:54:53,910
facebook.
Yeah.

3877
02:54:53,910 --> 02:54:55,210
Youtube and facebook.
ThoSe are the two places that stuff gets

3878
02:54:55,310 --> 02:55:00,310
facebook.
Like I don't put videos on facebook 

3879
02:55:00,310 --> 02:55:00,310
anymore because it just gets stolen 
immediately.

3880
02:55:00,310 --> 02:55:03,110
And also their revenue is.
What do you mean by get.

3881
02:55:03,860 --> 02:55:04,070
It's

3882
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:07,430
very easy for someone to rip your video 
off of,

3883
02:55:07,730 --> 02:55:12,730
you know,
put it somewhere else on facebook and 

3884
02:55:12,730 --> 02:55:14,450
whatever versus if they re upload it 
somewhere else on youtube,

3885
02:55:14,451 --> 02:55:16,640
the software algorithm will generally 
catch it.

3886
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:17,670
Oh,
I know.

3887
02:55:17,720 --> 02:55:22,720
So the software algorithm and facebook 
is not as effective and they don't 

3888
02:55:22,720 --> 02:55:22,720
really give a shit.
They don't care.

3889
02:55:22,720 --> 02:55:26,801
Yeah.
They're too busy selling your 

3890
02:55:26,801 --> 02:55:26,801
information.
So look in Russia.

3891
02:55:26,801 --> 02:55:27,630
Totally.
Jamie was watching the video of dr.

3892
02:55:27,880 --> 02:55:28,820
Soccer berg.
How did it go?

3893
02:55:29,570 --> 02:55:31,000
He should know the answer.
Yeah,

3894
02:55:32,700 --> 02:55:35,110
he had to go again today.
Uh,

3895
02:55:35,440 --> 02:55:37,540
I was watching right before you got here
in this.

3896
02:55:37,810 --> 02:55:39,430
I don't know where she was from,
but she was saying like,

3897
02:55:39,431 --> 02:55:42,280
you're the ceo of this company and you 
should know some of these answers.

3898
02:55:42,281 --> 02:55:43,580
And she was like,
listing all the shitty.

3899
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:45,850
Didn't know it was like,
this is ridiculous.

3900
02:55:45,851 --> 02:55:47,620
And then I afterwards,
now they've shown,

3901
02:55:47,860 --> 02:55:50,650
which I guess it's part of now,
public information has notes.

3902
02:55:50,860 --> 02:55:55,860
Oh no,
that he had like as references that he 

3903
02:55:55,860 --> 02:55:55,860
was looking at.
I've only seen one picture of it.

3904
02:55:55,860 --> 02:56:00,450
Just very weird stuff that like,
seems blatantly obvious that he should 

3905
02:56:00,450 --> 02:56:01,350
know or should say that's different from
what we've.

3906
02:56:01,540 --> 02:56:03,810
Maybe we think we should think they 
should be able to.

3907
02:56:04,680 --> 02:56:07,500
I get the impression that this company 
grew so fast,

3908
02:56:07,700 --> 02:56:09,960
they don't even know what the fuck is 
going on in now.

3909
02:56:09,961 --> 02:56:11,640
Will those.
The other thing he was talking about,

3910
02:56:11,641 --> 02:56:14,490
their influence on possible.
Are we going to continue?

3911
02:56:14,790 --> 02:56:15,950
We'll continue.
Don't worry about it.

3912
02:56:16,680 --> 02:56:21,680
He was talking about his influence on 
all these different upcoming elections 

3913
02:56:21,680 --> 02:56:25,521
that were coming up and about how they 
wanted to make sure that there was no 

3914
02:56:25,521 --> 02:56:27,240
bots that were influencing these 
elections and then I stopped and thought

3915
02:56:27,241 --> 02:56:28,590
about it and I'm like,
oh my god.

3916
02:56:28,770 --> 02:56:32,610
In that moment of him saying that,
I realized like what pressure he must be

3917
02:56:32,611 --> 02:56:37,611
under,
what pressure that company is under 

3918
02:56:37,611 --> 02:56:39,351
there.
They went from being a thing where 

3919
02:56:39,351 --> 02:56:39,351
people could share pictures like of,
hey,

3920
02:56:39,351 --> 02:56:40,710
this is us on our summer vacation and 
like,

3921
02:56:40,711 --> 02:56:41,360
hey,
you know,

3922
02:56:41,370 --> 02:56:43,590
fucking we're going to go to the pub on 
friday.

3923
02:56:43,740 --> 02:56:45,690
That's what facebook kind of was,
right?

3924
02:56:45,900 --> 02:56:48,420
People would talk about certain things 
in the news.

3925
02:56:48,570 --> 02:56:50,120
They would have opinions.
You put up something,

3926
02:56:50,130 --> 02:56:52,530
a bunch of people comment on it.
That's what it was.

3927
02:56:53,610 --> 02:56:58,610
Now with this last election and with him
testifying in front of congress,

3928
02:56:59,550 --> 02:57:04,550
what I'm seeing is facebook being like 
one of the most important sources of 

3929
02:57:05,250 --> 02:57:10,250
influence in the world today and it's 
not really being completely managed out.

3930
02:57:15,410 --> 02:57:17,560
I still feel like the russians,
the russians.

3931
02:57:17,620 --> 02:57:22,620
Yeah.
Maybe there's a little bit like google 

3932
02:57:22,620 --> 02:57:22,780
needs to be looked into going on with my
mic.

3933
02:57:23,110 --> 02:57:25,420
So google also probably like they have a
data,

3934
02:57:26,080 --> 02:57:27,550
I think someone was just looking into 
this,

3935
02:57:27,551 --> 02:57:29,600
you know,
people downloaded their facebook profile

3936
02:57:29,601 --> 02:57:31,510
and they're like,
my files one gigabyte.

3937
02:57:31,511 --> 02:57:32,770
Well,
how much data is in here?

3938
02:57:33,160 --> 02:57:35,670
People found out a way to download 
theirs and find their information.

3939
02:57:35,671 --> 02:57:37,240
And what,
what does facebook know about me?

3940
02:57:37,690 --> 02:57:41,410
Apparently there's also one that google 
has on everyone and it's much larger

3941
02:57:41,740 --> 02:57:46,740
to the music.
I'm not shocked,

3942
02:57:49,090 --> 02:57:50,440
you know,
I wouldn't be,

3943
02:57:50,920 --> 02:57:53,710
I wouldn't be nervous if it wasn't for 
that.

3944
02:57:54,340 --> 02:57:57,310
That memo thing,
um,

3945
02:57:57,311 --> 02:57:59,590
really changed my mind about a lot of 
things.

3946
02:57:59,591 --> 02:58:02,280
Not because,
you know,

3947
02:58:02,281 --> 02:58:04,980
it's a subject that's near and dear to 
my heart,

3948
02:58:04,981 --> 02:58:07,670
but because the way they were handling 
it was not,

3949
02:58:07,680 --> 02:58:10,230
there were,
weren't being honest.

3950
02:58:10,290 --> 02:58:15,290
They were,
they weren't being honest about the 

3951
02:58:15,290 --> 02:58:16,461
science.
They weren't being honest about the 

3952
02:58:16,461 --> 02:58:17,961
reaction.
They weren't even the way they were 

3953
02:58:17,961 --> 02:58:19,851
describing it.
We're talking about the james damore 

3954
02:58:19,851 --> 02:58:19,851
google memo.
Oh,

3955
02:58:19,851 --> 02:58:19,851
I don't know.
Oh,

3956
02:58:19,851 --> 02:58:24,310
it was at the seXism thing was that was 
the the what he was talking about women 

3957
02:58:24,310 --> 02:58:29,301
in tech explain why women would prefer 
to not like why some women are not 

3958
02:58:29,701 --> 02:58:32,760
influenced by the way google handled it 
was very,

3959
02:58:33,350 --> 02:58:36,090
very nervous because they weren't being 
honest about the information.

3960
02:58:36,270 --> 02:58:41,270
They weren't beIng honest about the 
results that weren't being honest about 

3961
02:58:41,270 --> 02:58:43,641
what was in his.
They were saying he was reinforcing 

3962
02:58:43,641 --> 02:58:44,280
harmful gender stereotypes.
That's not what he was doing.

3963
02:58:44,570 --> 02:58:49,570
What he was talking about,
the science of the difference in the 

3964
02:58:49,570 --> 02:58:51,801
psychology between men and women and why
women would gravitate towards different 

3965
02:58:51,801 --> 02:58:52,740
careers and maybe that's why more women 
aren't in tech.

3966
02:58:52,930 --> 02:58:55,140
Maybe there's ways to get women in tech 
will.

3967
02:58:55,141 --> 02:58:56,670
You've taken that angle before,
right?

3968
02:58:56,671 --> 02:58:58,740
with women and fighting and women in 
sports,

3969
02:58:58,741 --> 02:58:59,240
right?
Yeah.

3970
02:58:59,430 --> 02:59:01,890
There's some women that are not going to
want to be into those things.

3971
02:59:01,891 --> 02:59:06,891
There's something going on that are 
going to be wherever they are in 

3972
02:59:06,891 --> 02:59:07,020
comParison to men.
It's less likely that a woman's going to

3973
02:59:07,021 --> 02:59:12,021
be into fighting than a man.
I don't think that's extraordinary to 

3974
02:59:12,021 --> 02:59:12,300
say,
but a lot of women are into it.

3975
02:59:12,510 --> 02:59:17,510
It doesn't mean that it's impossible,
but it's just we're looking at human 

3976
02:59:17,510 --> 02:59:21,261
beings like if you're an outlier and 
you're a woman who really loves to 

3977
02:59:21,261 --> 02:59:21,261
fight,
there's nothing wrong with that.

3978
02:59:21,261 --> 02:59:22,290
I'm not saying there's anything wrong 
with that,

3979
02:59:22,291 --> 02:59:25,620
but I'm saying it's much more rare that 
a woman who wants to,

3980
02:59:25,640 --> 02:59:27,960
you know,
do become a nurse or do something that's

3981
02:59:27,961 --> 02:59:31,020
traditionally a female,
a care giver,

3982
02:59:31,021 --> 02:59:33,000
sort of a position which is really 
common.

3983
02:59:33,120 --> 02:59:38,120
And I read it.
Did the letter memo indicate like this 

3984
02:59:38,120 --> 02:59:41,720
that science says women were less 
predisposed to becoming programmers or 

3985
02:59:41,720 --> 02:59:42,210
something like that?
No,

3986
02:59:42,330 --> 02:59:45,060
no.
It just was talking about gender.

3987
02:59:45,110 --> 02:59:50,110
I'm like,
choices and choices people make and why 

3988
02:59:50,110 --> 02:59:51,190
they make them based on personality 
traits and how,

3989
02:59:51,300 --> 02:59:54,390
why things are more common.
Certain things are more common in males.

3990
02:59:54,480 --> 02:59:59,480
Certain things are more common in women 
and that this would indicate why there 

3991
02:59:59,480 --> 03:00:02,871
were less women that were involved in 
tech and it wasn't some systemic sort 

3992
03:00:02,871 --> 03:00:03,010
of,
um,

3993
03:00:03,210 --> 03:00:07,230
discrimination campaign put on by men,
you know.

3994
03:00:07,470 --> 03:00:12,470
But my point was,
we're talking about them having all the 

3995
03:00:12,470 --> 03:00:13,170
information that you have,
like google and facebook,

3996
03:00:13,440 --> 03:00:14,970
how much inflammation they hit on you.

3997
03:00:15,300 --> 03:00:18,990
It would make me less nervous if I 
didn't know about that,

3998
03:00:19,080 --> 03:00:21,030
how they handle that google memo thing 
because I'm like,

3999
03:00:21,031 --> 03:00:24,240
well you guys aren't being honest about 
what this is what the guy wrote.

4000
03:00:24,280 --> 03:00:29,280
You're paying the guy out to be a 
villain and you think if you fire him 

4001
03:00:29,280 --> 03:00:30,090
and drown this,
that this story goes out.

4002
03:00:30,091 --> 03:00:35,091
And then you guys get to look like 
social justice warriors and then you 

4003
03:00:35,091 --> 03:00:37,890
don't take the heat from the what,
you know it was an objective analysis of

4004
03:00:37,891 --> 03:00:38,820
this issue.
WeLl,

4005
03:00:38,821 --> 03:00:39,600
I don't.
I'm not sure.

4006
03:00:39,601 --> 03:00:43,260
Mark zuckerberg has a lot of incentive 
to be totally honest in this chase.

4007
03:00:43,800 --> 03:00:48,800
Either he's totally honest and he's 
malicious or he's totally honest and 

4008
03:00:48,800 --> 03:00:50,610
he's almost comically ignorant about 
certain things.

4009
03:00:50,940 --> 03:00:51,680
Yeah.
What he's saying,

4010
03:00:51,780 --> 03:00:56,780
he's.
I think he's almost got to say he 

4011
03:00:56,780 --> 03:00:56,780
doesn't know,
but the problem is that they improve.

4012
03:00:56,780 --> 03:01:01,320
He knows.
He should know though is I feel like 

4013
03:01:01,320 --> 03:01:01,320
also

4014
03:01:01,320 --> 03:01:04,980
part of the thing he should know now,
him saying he doesn't know what if they 

4015
03:01:04,980 --> 03:01:09,541
can pull up an email,
wouldn't mean what if they have access 

4016
03:01:09,541 --> 03:01:09,541
to all of his emails and it shows that 
he knows.

4017
03:01:09,670 --> 03:01:14,670
They did.
I was talking to yesterday about it and 

4018
03:01:14,670 --> 03:01:14,670
we were like worried about the facebook 
recording thing.

4019
03:01:14,670 --> 03:01:18,661
Is anybody gonna bring that up and it 
was brought up and he said that they 

4020
03:01:18,661 --> 03:01:18,661
don't record audio.

4021
03:01:18,680 --> 03:01:19,840
Facebook doesn't.
Right.

4022
03:01:19,880 --> 03:01:21,370
You were talking about it with google 
weren't.

4023
03:01:21,380 --> 03:01:24,710
You were talking about it with google 
that if you talk,

4024
03:01:24,740 --> 03:01:27,440
if you were talking in a room about a 
certain subject,

4025
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:29,090
have you ever had that happen?
Right.

4026
03:01:29,091 --> 03:01:30,690
That's the apple home pod.
You've.

4027
03:01:30,860 --> 03:01:32,660
You've had,
you've been talking about something in a

4028
03:01:32,661 --> 03:01:35,330
room and then had pop up ads pop up,
right?

4029
03:01:35,530 --> 03:01:36,390
No,
I have it.

4030
03:01:36,800 --> 03:01:37,100
No,
no,

4031
03:01:37,101 --> 03:01:38,060
no.
I believe it though.

4032
03:01:38,240 --> 03:01:39,090
It happens.
You had it.

4033
03:01:39,350 --> 03:01:41,290
It happened to me before.
Not.

4034
03:01:41,560 --> 03:01:46,560
I don't know how.
I couldn't tell you what were the 

4035
03:01:46,560 --> 03:01:46,760
signals went,
but I've definitely had strain.

4036
03:01:46,790 --> 03:01:51,790
It could be a coincidence,
but I've had strange ads pop up that 

4037
03:01:51,790 --> 03:01:51,790
are.

4038
03:01:51,790 --> 03:01:55,620
I read that,
that I don't know if it's accurate 

4039
03:01:55,620 --> 03:01:58,141
though.
When I was reading that there people 

4040
03:01:58,141 --> 03:01:59,581
have tried to prove and it could be 
people on facebook side just to give 

4041
03:01:59,581 --> 03:02:02,161
them propaganda that that's almost 
nearly impossible to do right now just 

4042
03:02:02,161 --> 03:02:04,060
because of the technology would take to 
record your audio,

4043
03:02:04,061 --> 03:02:07,900
have it scanned by something and then 
deliver an ad to you based off of that.

4044
03:02:07,901 --> 03:02:08,160
And amanda.

4045
03:02:08,450 --> 03:02:09,860
Yeah,
it's entirely possible.

4046
03:02:09,861 --> 03:02:14,861
I could have looked at something similar
at a recent time when it was just far 

4047
03:02:14,931 --> 03:02:17,060
enough away for me to not make an exact 
connection.

4048
03:02:17,061 --> 03:02:22,061
I don't want to quit.
It represents those that you recognize 

4049
03:02:22,061 --> 03:02:24,791
that that is potentially in the future.
Like for things like alexa and things 

4050
03:02:24,791 --> 03:02:29,741
like home pod and the devices that are 
designed to listen to your voice or 

4051
03:02:30,460 --> 03:02:32,810
that's the whole point of them.
You know,

4052
03:02:33,600 --> 03:02:36,140
all this good.
I don't know dude.

4053
03:02:36,141 --> 03:02:38,180
I get a lot of.
I get a lot of shit done.

4054
03:02:39,060 --> 03:02:41,630
I'm real productive.
You know I can,

4055
03:02:41,660 --> 03:02:43,550
I can.
I have things that are,

4056
03:02:43,551 --> 03:02:47,510
would Be very difficult to find that can
be delivered,

4057
03:02:47,690 --> 03:02:48,980
bro.
I had,

4058
03:02:49,240 --> 03:02:50,090
I have a,
I have a,

4059
03:02:50,210 --> 03:02:54,710
I have a 2001 mercedes sl 500.
So my traffic car.

4060
03:02:54,930 --> 03:02:57,980
Ah,
perfect for traffic and nice big clarion

4061
03:02:58,010 --> 03:02:59,780
system is great.

4062
03:03:00,080 --> 03:03:03,860
I love my traffic car and you know,
it's got the old school,

4063
03:03:03,861 --> 03:03:08,861
removable hard top.
So I needed to get the stand to put the 

4064
03:03:08,861 --> 03:03:08,861
hard top on when it took it off.
Right.

4065
03:03:09,410 --> 03:03:14,410
Amazon 12 hours.
I had a stand for a 2011 mercy delivered

4066
03:03:15,651 --> 03:03:16,980
to my house.
Wow.

4067
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:19,310
That level of convenience.
Yeah.

4068
03:03:19,490 --> 03:03:21,380
I'll give up a little privacy little 
bit.

4069
03:03:21,440 --> 03:03:22,820
Little bit.
Fine.

4070
03:03:23,190 --> 03:03:24,200
I'll give,
I'll give it up.

4071
03:03:24,230 --> 03:03:25,940
You can have it.
That's what's gonna get us.

4072
03:03:26,150 --> 03:03:27,980
That's what's going to get us to turn us
into machines.

4073
03:03:28,070 --> 03:03:30,040
Just give up a little bit here a little 
bit here.

4074
03:03:31,490 --> 03:03:35,180
I don't want to give up all of it.
Like I'm definitely opposed to the drive

4075
03:03:35,181 --> 03:03:36,980
vehicle tracking,
you know,

4076
03:03:36,981 --> 03:03:37,790
like,
like,

4077
03:03:37,791 --> 03:03:39,200
uh,
about having a car that,

4078
03:03:39,280 --> 03:03:41,750
that knows where you've been and tell 
somebody about it.

4079
03:03:41,890 --> 03:03:44,270
Um,
which a certain company does do that,

4080
03:03:44,390 --> 03:03:48,940
what will companies this will tesla's 
know where you been well done,

4081
03:03:48,960 --> 03:03:53,960
don't they all by virtue of their gps,
but tesla's are wirelessly connected to 

4082
03:03:53,960 --> 03:03:56,510
tesla.
So the reason.

4083
03:03:56,590 --> 03:03:58,220
So part of the reason tesla

4084
03:03:58,230 --> 03:04:03,230
semi autonomous system works as well as 
it does and part of the reason tesla is 

4085
03:04:03,920 --> 03:04:08,920
doing what they're doing as a company is
your car's all tesla's on the road are 

4086
03:04:08,920 --> 03:04:11,220
collecting mapping data for tesla,
you know,

4087
03:04:11,240 --> 03:04:13,550
in real time.
So they can,

4088
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:19,000
you know,
be ethical with that data or they 

4089
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:20,771
cannot.
And odds are they don't give a shit 

4090
03:04:20,771 --> 03:04:22,331
where you're going other than to help 
them figure out where to put the next 

4091
03:04:22,331 --> 03:04:25,840
superchargers and and whatnot.
And in general you have to assume that 

4092
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:29,560
to improve your experience.
But if you extrapolate this 50 years 

4093
03:04:29,560 --> 03:04:31,310
down the road and some of our privacy's 
get worn away,

4094
03:04:31,580 --> 03:04:34,080
you could end up with a car that were,
you know,

4095
03:04:34,100 --> 03:04:39,100
where it's very easy to subpoena the 
records of your tesla and find out 

4096
03:04:39,100 --> 03:04:41,690
exactly where you went.
So a test that would be the worst car if

4097
03:04:41,691 --> 03:04:42,890
you were like a bank robber.

4098
03:04:42,920 --> 03:04:46,730
Fuck ya know,
if you need a hundred miles analog,

4099
03:04:47,020 --> 03:04:48,230
analog,
big fuel tank.

4100
03:04:48,231 --> 03:04:51,020
Think transporter one.
Jason statham.

4101
03:04:51,880 --> 03:04:53,840
That's what you want.
big fuel cell.

4102
03:04:54,290 --> 03:04:56,510
Black.
Late model car.

4103
03:04:56,540 --> 03:05:00,130
What's that in invisible black again.
Vanna black.

4104
03:05:00,140 --> 03:05:02,740
Phantom.
Black car?

4105
03:05:03,170 --> 03:05:05,490
No,
no one right now.

4106
03:05:05,600 --> 03:05:08,030
We haven't painted anything like big in 
it yet.

4107
03:05:08,240 --> 03:05:11,510
It's not yet motherfuck I have venta car
on the way.

4108
03:05:11,660 --> 03:05:16,660
There's some weird environmental shit 
with vanna black because John John Ward 

4109
03:05:16,660 --> 03:05:18,710
was telling me that there is one note 
that is velvet.

4110
03:05:18,740 --> 03:05:21,260
My frIend velvet.
That's fucking velvet.

4111
03:05:21,610 --> 03:05:22,500
You?
Yep.

4112
03:05:22,510 --> 03:05:23,620
That's real.
Yup.

4113
03:05:23,890 --> 03:05:25,710
Oh wait a minute.
That's not.

4114
03:05:25,730 --> 03:05:28,130
That says vanna black,
but that's not vantive black.

4115
03:05:28,160 --> 03:05:30,530
That is a velvet car.
That.

4116
03:05:31,640 --> 03:05:32,190
Wait a minute,
this,

4117
03:05:32,410 --> 03:05:35,450
this rolls royce is not to,
but it's not vanna black.

4118
03:05:36,110 --> 03:05:37,140
Zippo.
Impossible.

4119
03:05:37,150 --> 03:05:38,690
It says it is there.
I'm telling you,

4120
03:05:38,691 --> 03:05:40,250
they haven't painted a car in vantaa 
black.

4121
03:05:40,251 --> 03:05:43,880
So either that's fake or it's the velvet
shit they're doing now.

4122
03:05:44,560 --> 03:05:46,590
That's a computer.
Yeah.

4123
03:05:46,720 --> 03:05:51,720
Would what it would look like.
now what is it made out of that allows 

4124
03:05:51,891 --> 03:05:54,230
it to get to this level of darkness?
You know?

4125
03:05:54,231 --> 03:05:57,500
I don't know.
It is just damn crazy.

4126
03:05:57,640 --> 03:06:01,840
Looks dope job.
Please don't put your make up.

4127
03:06:03,230 --> 03:06:05,930
We can't be frIends anymore.
You can do that.

4128
03:06:05,990 --> 03:06:08,600
I saw justin bieber wants driving around
in a,

4129
03:06:08,601 --> 03:06:10,790
a leopard print audi.
Oh,

4130
03:06:10,910 --> 03:06:12,000
he's got to do what?
He's got to do.

4131
03:06:12,620 --> 03:06:17,620
Fewer.
Twenty three years old and drownIng and 

4132
03:06:17,620 --> 03:06:17,620
pussy.
You'd probably do.

4133
03:06:17,620 --> 03:06:17,620
This is think this was years ago.
It was probably 19.

4134
03:06:17,620 --> 03:06:18,800
He's probably trying to keep them away 
from him.

4135
03:06:18,801 --> 03:06:20,870
It was probably one of the grossest the 
car possible.

4136
03:06:20,871 --> 03:06:21,890
Just to say,
look,

4137
03:06:22,640 --> 03:06:27,290
stay away from my dick to cover.
Who of your crazy guest has rolled up to

4138
03:06:27,291 --> 03:06:29,700
your studio and the dopest car.
Do you.

4139
03:06:29,750 --> 03:06:30,920
Does anything come to mind?

4140
03:06:32,520 --> 03:06:34,960
To bill's area and roll up and that six 
by six.

4141
03:06:35,010 --> 03:06:40,010
Got you.
I wasn't cool is so gross.

4142
03:06:41,710 --> 03:06:46,710
That's disgusting.
I didn't even really believe me because 

4143
03:06:46,710 --> 03:06:47,590
I knew we had a uh,
a,

4144
03:06:47,800 --> 03:06:52,060
a chrome fisker,
fisker karma wasn't.

4145
03:06:52,061 --> 03:06:52,630
Um.
Yeah.

4146
03:06:52,631 --> 03:06:55,780
And they just released that thing I 
heard they did though.

4147
03:06:56,280 --> 03:06:59,590
Company bought all the assets and 
they've started blowing up and trying to

4148
03:06:59,591 --> 03:07:04,020
get water when the ones that I asked for
one for review,

4149
03:07:04,370 --> 03:07:05,990
they say hold.
Lightly declined.

4150
03:07:06,020 --> 03:07:06,750
Yeah.
I wonder why.

4151
03:07:06,820 --> 03:07:07,500
Yeah,
yeah.

4152
03:07:07,501 --> 03:07:10,560
You got a big mouth going to drive 
through a puddle ones.

4153
03:07:13,520 --> 03:07:14,700
Yeah.
Electric cars,

4154
03:07:14,701 --> 03:07:15,930
man.
There's a bright future.

4155
03:07:15,960 --> 03:07:20,960
It's just a.
I don't want to jump in yet and I don't 

4156
03:07:20,960 --> 03:07:20,960
want anything driving for me.
True.

4157
03:07:20,960 --> 03:07:22,170
Have you,
have you driven electric carver?

4158
03:07:22,200 --> 03:07:23,160
Yeah,
I've driven a tesla.

4159
03:07:23,161 --> 03:07:24,120
They're nice.
They're nice.

4160
03:07:24,121 --> 03:07:24,960
Yeah.
It's weird.

4161
03:07:24,961 --> 03:07:26,130
It feels weird.
It does,

4162
03:07:26,131 --> 03:07:29,100
but in an urban environment,
you can see why it's a nice experience.

4163
03:07:29,101 --> 03:07:31,400
When I drive An electric car,
there's the fisker.

4164
03:07:31,740 --> 03:07:34,320
When I drive an electric car and I get 
where I'm going,

4165
03:07:34,530 --> 03:07:39,360
I am noticeably more relaxed than when 
I'm driving a gas car,

4166
03:07:39,361 --> 03:07:41,340
especially if I'm driving like allowed 
sportscar.

4167
03:07:41,580 --> 03:07:42,090
Right,
right,

4168
03:07:42,091 --> 03:07:42,450
right.
Yeah.

4169
03:07:42,510 --> 03:07:47,510
The goal,
those vibrations and stuff go through 

4170
03:07:47,510 --> 03:07:50,970
your body and kind of like stick with 
you versus the serenity of that silence.

4171
03:07:51,600 --> 03:07:55,890
Just the 250 mile range.
It annoys the shit out of me.

4172
03:07:55,891 --> 03:07:56,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

4173
03:07:56,251 --> 03:07:56,850
No,
it's.

4174
03:07:56,880 --> 03:08:01,880
They need infrastructure like they're 
considering how many teslas are in los 

4175
03:08:01,880 --> 03:08:01,880
angeles.

4176
03:08:01,880 --> 03:08:04,980
There's an embarrassingly small number 
of superchargers in the city.

4177
03:08:05,100 --> 03:08:10,100
There's not a lot of places to charge 
the tesla outside of your home and they 

4178
03:08:10,100 --> 03:08:15,020
really need to do the infrastructure and
they need to come up with a faster 

4179
03:08:15,020 --> 03:08:18,480
charging solution.
Which porsche it seems may have done.

4180
03:08:19,140 --> 03:08:22,320
Porsche has a new electric car coming 
out called the mission e,

4181
03:08:22,830 --> 03:08:27,830
which is a tesla fighting thing and they
supposedly have a fast charging system 

4182
03:08:28,770 --> 03:08:32,460
that can do like an 80 percent charge in
10 minutes or something.

4183
03:08:32,740 --> 03:08:34,220
Yeah.
Well,

4184
03:08:34,300 --> 03:08:37,290
so you know,
that's crazy.

4185
03:08:37,350 --> 03:08:39,600
Ten minutes is pretty close.
Ten minutes is fast.

4186
03:08:39,690 --> 03:08:42,870
If you get three right,
you have three to five.

4187
03:08:43,370 --> 03:08:45,160
10 is fine.
10 works.

4188
03:08:45,620 --> 03:08:50,620
Ten's good.
And a competitor is good because you 

4189
03:08:50,620 --> 03:08:50,640
know tesla's,
you can't charge them for free anymore.

4190
03:08:51,270 --> 03:08:53,790
You don't know the model.
Three's and the new ones,

4191
03:08:53,791 --> 03:08:56,210
they don't come with free charging and 
he's motherfuckers.

4192
03:08:56,220 --> 03:08:59,020
That's how they get you.
$5 rocks first one's free.

4193
03:08:59,890 --> 03:09:01,140
Yup.
Yup.

4194
03:09:01,320 --> 03:09:03,660
No more free juice.
Wow.

4195
03:09:03,690 --> 03:09:08,690
How long was it free for a few years.
At 2013 the model s came out and four 

4196
03:09:09,061 --> 03:09:14,061
years or so.
So what happens when you pull into the 

4197
03:09:14,061 --> 03:09:16,490
airport and you go to one of them 
electric spots per credit card or you 

4198
03:09:16,490 --> 03:09:20,571
have a rfid fob or something?
Fuck these motherfuckers gotta pay to 

4199
03:09:21,301 --> 03:09:26,301
play my friend.
Why can't they figure out how with all 

4200
03:09:26,301 --> 03:09:26,850
the sun in la to have a solar powered 
car?

4201
03:09:27,090 --> 03:09:28,410
Uh,
you just,

4202
03:09:29,010 --> 03:09:33,220
it's just not possible with photovoltaic
cells to generate enough much.

4203
03:09:33,280 --> 03:09:37,020
Dude.
it takes so much juice to move a 4,000

4204
03:09:37,021 --> 03:09:42,021
pound car down the road.
So much more than turning on a light or 

4205
03:09:42,021 --> 03:09:45,540
playing a radio.
Like that mass movement.

4206
03:09:45,990 --> 03:09:50,990
It takes so much energy.
Fisker had something on the roof that 

4207
03:09:50,990 --> 03:09:51,870
powers the radio,
right?

4208
03:09:51,900 --> 03:09:55,860
Yeah.
I know there are a couple of company.

4209
03:09:57,280 --> 03:10:02,280
FiSker was one.
Someone else did a photo voltaic roof 

4210
03:10:02,280 --> 03:10:02,800
where it,
it likes circulates the climate,

4211
03:10:02,830 --> 03:10:07,830
the air when it's really hot out or it 
can pre turn on certain things and shit 

4212
03:10:08,561 --> 03:10:09,210
like that.
Yeah.

4213
03:10:09,211 --> 03:10:14,211
Yeah.
But it's not enough to run or charge a 

4214
03:10:14,211 --> 03:10:16,621
car.
What if that's gonna change in the 

4215
03:10:16,621 --> 03:10:18,271
future?
I'm sure they don't have solar panels 

4216
03:10:18,271 --> 03:10:19,030
really.
Have they come that far yet?

4217
03:10:19,060 --> 03:10:21,610
We'll test a solar as a roof tile.
I've seen this.

4218
03:10:21,680 --> 03:10:22,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

4219
03:10:22,390 --> 03:10:24,320
Tesla roof tile.
Yeah.

4220
03:10:24,550 --> 03:10:29,550
They're trying to do a tesla solar tile 
that goes on your roof that then will 

4221
03:10:29,550 --> 03:10:32,950
feed into the tesla battery pack that 
hangs on your wall.

4222
03:10:33,230 --> 03:10:38,230
You know,
and then you can be a autonomous 

4223
03:10:38,230 --> 03:10:38,230
basIcally sorta.
But you're still in the grid.

4224
03:10:38,230 --> 03:10:39,880
Yes.
And you give money back to the,

4225
03:10:39,890 --> 03:10:41,150
the,
the reason why they do that they want,

4226
03:10:41,230 --> 03:10:42,940
they don't want you being completely off
the grid.

4227
03:10:42,940 --> 03:10:45,100
They don't want the grid that died.
You know,

4228
03:10:45,160 --> 03:10:48,970
people are really worried about that.
Well I'm building a building right now,

4229
03:10:49,090 --> 03:10:51,730
so get this la,
you know I'm a democrat,

4230
03:10:51,731 --> 03:10:54,130
but la will make you want to hang 
yourself building shit.

4231
03:10:54,970 --> 03:10:58,690
So I have to prep my building for solar 
panels,

4232
03:10:58,870 --> 03:11:03,870
whether I put them on or not.
If I put them on their $92,000

4233
03:11:05,170 --> 03:11:08,440
to cover the roof and solar panels and I
will pay.

4234
03:11:08,710 --> 03:11:13,710
They pay themselves off in seven years.
So I generate swelled thousand dollars 

4235
03:11:14,471 --> 03:11:19,471
or so,
a year in power and then after that I'm 

4236
03:11:19,471 --> 03:11:23,041
fully,
fully positive and the city will pay me 

4237
03:11:23,041 --> 03:11:26,290
every year and they pay themselves off 
in seven years and the life span of them

4238
03:11:26,291 --> 03:11:31,291
is 20 years.
So I could potentially have many years 

4239
03:11:31,291 --> 03:11:31,450
of free power.
Wow.

4240
03:11:31,510 --> 03:11:32,680
Yeah.
So you're,

4241
03:11:33,580 --> 03:11:38,580
you're building.
I'm building a collector car storage 

4242
03:11:38,580 --> 03:11:38,580
facility.
Here's where I plug it.

4243
03:11:38,580 --> 03:11:39,550
It's called west side collector car 
storage.

4244
03:11:39,790 --> 03:11:42,280
It's going to be in playa vista,
California,

4245
03:11:42,281 --> 03:11:45,040
which is the sweet new part of la.
Beautiful area.

4246
03:11:45,070 --> 03:11:50,070
Yeah.
Do you know where the clippers practice 

4247
03:11:50,070 --> 03:11:50,070
facility is?
You seeing that?

4248
03:11:50,070 --> 03:11:50,470
It's right next to the fox hills mall,
right by lax,

4249
03:11:50,500 --> 03:11:52,510
venice.
It's conveniently located.

4250
03:11:52,900 --> 03:11:57,900
Um,
and I'm going to have storage for 150 

4251
03:11:57,900 --> 03:11:59,020
cars.
It's going to be secure climate control,

4252
03:11:59,050 --> 03:12:00,430
the whole,
the whole deal.

4253
03:12:00,610 --> 03:12:05,610
So this is,
you're doing it as an investment or as 

4254
03:12:05,610 --> 03:12:05,610
a,
as a business.

4255
03:12:05,610 --> 03:12:06,160
He has a business ground up.
It's great for customers is not,

4256
03:12:06,161 --> 03:12:11,161
you know,
it's not for me and we're building a 

4257
03:12:11,161 --> 03:12:11,161
cool studio there like this,
like you've got.

4258
03:12:11,161 --> 03:12:14,791
instead of my shanti little studio,
now I'm going to do a podcast and the 

4259
03:12:14,791 --> 03:12:17,530
podcast studio is going to be elevated,
so we have car stackers,

4260
03:12:17,560 --> 03:12:22,300
so I've 24 high stackers and the studio 
is elevated.

4261
03:12:22,300 --> 03:12:25,080
And when just look out over the stacked 
cars.

4262
03:12:25,090 --> 03:12:27,880
yeah,
that's going to be killer,

4263
03:12:28,510 --> 03:12:32,860
but I have to comply with a lot of 
California environmental craziness.

4264
03:12:33,160 --> 03:12:36,430
I have to put a fire hydrant in this 
like for the city,

4265
03:12:36,460 --> 03:12:39,420
like I have to do it for the city to get
a building permit.

4266
03:12:39,600 --> 03:12:43,300
Well it kind of makes sense if you're 
fucking cars catch on fire.

4267
03:12:43,301 --> 03:12:45,730
You got a lot of gasoline in that one 
spot.

4268
03:12:45,731 --> 03:12:46,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

4269
03:12:46,250 --> 03:12:49,750
The fire system that we have to build is
incredible,

4270
03:12:49,780 --> 03:12:50,860
I would imagine.
Yeah.

4271
03:12:50,861 --> 03:12:54,110
And we have to have auxiliary pumps.
It flows 3,500

4272
03:12:54,111 --> 03:12:57,500
gallons a minute in every car.
So the stacks,

4273
03:12:57,830 --> 03:13:02,030
every car on a stack has two nozzles at 
it front and back,

4274
03:13:02,190 --> 03:13:05,360
while every car has its own set of 
nozzles.

4275
03:13:05,390 --> 03:13:08,210
Wow.
So if a fire starts over here,

4276
03:13:08,211 --> 03:13:10,200
it's completely contained over here and 
I.

4277
03:13:10,220 --> 03:13:12,590
The idea that they kick on automatically
when.

4278
03:13:12,950 --> 03:13:14,360
Oh wow.
That's incredible.

4279
03:13:14,640 --> 03:13:17,780
That's a really neat,
but I'm four years into this now,

4280
03:13:18,710 --> 03:13:21,560
so broken ground yet hopefully next 
week.

4281
03:13:21,590 --> 03:13:24,350
Wow.
Permits just got.

4282
03:13:24,351 --> 03:13:25,790
Just got approved.
Wow,

4283
03:13:25,820 --> 03:13:26,870
that's dope.
Dude.

4284
03:13:26,900 --> 03:13:28,220
Come back on when it's done.
Oh,

4285
03:13:28,250 --> 03:13:29,440
that'd be great.
CoMe back on wednesday.

4286
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:31,330
So people.
No,

4287
03:13:31,430 --> 03:13:31,870
thank you.
Um,

4288
03:13:31,940 --> 03:13:34,040
we've been doing this for like three 
hours And a half.

4289
03:13:34,041 --> 03:13:37,730
Is there anything else that.
is there any other shit going on?

4290
03:13:37,850 --> 03:13:39,110
No,
I'm just happy to see you.

4291
03:13:39,140 --> 03:13:44,140
I'm happy to see you.
I'm sorry I didn't get to come to your 

4292
03:13:44,140 --> 03:13:45,731
new year's show because they've made it 
a tradition two years in a row all over 

4293
03:13:45,731 --> 03:13:45,731
this place.
I know.

4294
03:13:45,731 --> 03:13:48,550
I liked your new special to the one that
where it was crop tight.

4295
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:49,670
Yeah.

4296
03:13:49,671 --> 03:13:52,040
I liked that very much.
Doing that with my next went to.

4297
03:13:52,041 --> 03:13:53,750
I'm trying to make it like you're 
sitting in the audience.

4298
03:13:53,780 --> 03:13:56,510
That's great idea behind it.
And I liked chappelle's tiny one.

4299
03:13:56,511 --> 03:13:57,950
He did in the belly roll.
Yeah.

4300
03:13:58,070 --> 03:14:03,070
I was at gotham comedy club when he 
first told that iceberg slim story when 

4301
03:14:03,070 --> 03:14:05,820
he came back from africa,
I was friends with christmas lee.

4302
03:14:05,821 --> 03:14:06,590
And he's like,
