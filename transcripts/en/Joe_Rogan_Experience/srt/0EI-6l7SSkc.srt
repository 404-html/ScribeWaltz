1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,900
I wish I knew like foreign languages,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,250
so I can say something like,

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,701
you know,

4
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:05,960
ball,

5
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,200
swamp tsunamis.

6
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,430
But I don't know what that means.

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,350
So I might be saying something stupid.

8
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,020
Hello everybody in English,

9
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,690
this episode of the podcast
brought to you by Squarespace,

10
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,960
which we were talking about
before the podcast even began.

11
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,600
So we're not bullshitting you
when we tell you it's awesome.

12
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,171
Powerful.

13
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:24,440
Nick Usif used the Squarespace.

14
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,230
Uh,

15
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,800
Brian's made at least 20 or 30 websites,

16
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:29,280
right?

17
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,113
If you had to guess.

18
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:30,930
Yeah,

19
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,380
yeah,

20
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,010
probably.

21
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,020
It's super easy to do.

22
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,620
It used to be a huge pain in the
ass if you wanted to get a website,

23
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,520
unless you were super lucky and knew some
guy who was awesome and it was easy to

24
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:42,031
deal with.

25
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:42,541
Like me,

26
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,620
I have found an awesome guy.

27
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,641
But if you,

28
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:45,090
uh,

29
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,923
my friend Menthol,

30
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,040
but if,

31
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,620
if you don't find that you're fucked,

32
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,221
you know,

33
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:52,500
you've got to try to
learn coding yourself.

34
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,580
Good luck.

35
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,140
Good luck.

36
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,311
It's difficult.

37
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,144
And it's also,

38
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,160
it used to be really
difficult to mash things up.

39
00:00:59,161 --> 00:00:59,960
Like for,

40
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,360
uh,

41
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,171
one browser.

42
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:01,891
It would look great,

43
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:03,270
but then you'd see it in safari.

44
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,250
It would look all wonky or you know,

45
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,870
it worked good with a windows,

46
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,940
but it wouldn't work with
a Mac or whatever it was.

47
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,400
There was always issues
with compatibility,

48
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:13,380
like iPhone compatibility.

49
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:14,610
A lot of times that would be squirrelly.

50
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,810
Squarespace,

51
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,090
they have it set up where your website,

52
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:19,680
we'll work on everything.

53
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,880
It'll work on an android phone and I'll
work on an iPad and a work on one of

54
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:24,480
those,

55
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,900
those tablets of unknown origin that you,

56
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:28,440
uh,

57
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,230
run various operating systems on.

58
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,290
It's just fucking works.

59
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:31,951
Works awesome.

60
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:33,180
We could set up an online store,

61
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:34,380
super easy to do.

62
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,810
Just point and click,

63
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:37,830
drag and drop.

64
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,851
They have 24,

65
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:39,720
seven support.

66
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,710
It's simple,

67
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,341
easy,

68
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:44,730
beautiful designs and it
looks completely professional.

69
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,050
Like look at this website.

70
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,210
He slapping together a website right now,

71
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,630
a use of website and
he can do it like that.

72
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:52,464
Just pee.

73
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,493
I mean it's,

74
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,620
it comes out like,

75
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,480
like you hired somebody,

76
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:00,570
like you spend a lot of money and
you could bang them out quick.

77
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,770
They just got it wired.

78
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:02,700
They figured it out.

79
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,210
Like there's no need to to
go anywhere else anymore.

80
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,380
You can make your own shit,

81
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,330
especially if you are even remotely,

82
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:10,650
creatively inclined,

83
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:13,650
but you were just
technologically ignorant.

84
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,843
You know,

85
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,170
if,

86
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,140
if that was the case,

87
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:17,460
this is super easy to use.

88
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,860
Squarespace has a logo creator.

89
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,120
You can create a clean,

90
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:26,121
simple logo design for yourself in
minutes for a free trial and 10% off your

91
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:27,474
first purchase.

92
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,830
Go to squarespace.com and entering
the code word Joe Squarespace.

93
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,440
A better web starts with your website.

94
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,730
That's what they make you say.

95
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,423
That's their part.

96
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,360
It's really easy.

97
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:39,601
It's,

98
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,250
it's so drag and drop.

99
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:42,990
Like if you want a map like sick,

100
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:45,570
if you have a store and
you went to Google map,

101
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,410
I love them.

102
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,550
I'm going to eventually get right there.

103
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,473
That one great.

104
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,380
If I get some time,

105
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:50,490
I want to make my own website.

106
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,330
That's fun.

107
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,740
I made mine in like four hours,

108
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,740
but the one you just
made is better than mine.

109
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:57,830
Um,

110
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,130
we're also brought to you by ting.

111
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,110
I got my new tank phone hear
Ting is which the official,

112
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,010
I got the galaxy s five.

113
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,150
Cool.

114
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,420
Yeah,

115
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,070
just kind of,

116
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,450
I'm a phone Ho.

117
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,284
Uh,

118
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,990
he's my little phone or device.

119
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,183
Um,

120
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,170
it's dope little phone.

121
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,560
I like the fact that it's waterproof.

122
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,460
That's pretty slick.

123
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,301
That's the thing.

124
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,520
And they're all becoming waterproof
to make so much more sense.

125
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,011
Yeah.

126
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:20,100
He dropped his phone in water,

127
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:20,460
dude.

128
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,000
Wow.

129
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,570
Yeah.

130
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,330
And it's just like what
gets out of the water?

131
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:26,250
What bitch water resistant.

132
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,350
Some of them are actually waterproof,

133
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,350
I believe there's a Sony
that's actually waterproof,

134
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
which is pretty fantastic.

135
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,940
A ting is a website or things,

136
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,350
a mobile service company
that uses a sprint.

137
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,310
What they do is you buy your
phone from them and then they,

138
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,930
they handle all the rest,

139
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:47,310
all goes to a sprint backbone.

140
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:51,290
But you do it by their rules and
their rules are just a lot fair,

141
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,370
a lot easier for people to digest.

142
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,120
You know,

143
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,500
I think everybody enjoys paying
for things that are worth it.

144
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,190
You know,

145
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,110
it's nice when you go to a good restaurant
and he'd get a nice meal and you pay

146
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:04,381
for it.

147
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:05,340
You feel good about it.

148
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:06,420
It was a good experience.

149
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:06,630
I cut.

150
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,500
That was great.

151
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:08,334
You leave there,

152
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,260
whatever you spent was totally worth it.

153
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,930
It's always a shitty
feeling when you know,

154
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:14,400
even if you enjoy something,

155
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:17,430
if you feel like you've got fucked
over or you feel like it's too much,

156
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:18,510
I feel like it's not fair.

157
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,670
And for the longest time
the weigh cell phone,

158
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,270
uh,

159
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,540
companies have done business
has irked a lot of people.

160
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,970
One of the things being that
you pay for your minutes,

161
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,020
like you know,

162
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:30,270
you have like this thing like 120 minutes,

163
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,980
but if you don't use
that hundred 20 minutes,

164
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,300
you don't get any money back.

165
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,460
Like that money's just gone.

166
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,440
Like all the time is out in the ether.

167
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,760
And Ting was like,

168
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,520
well why do you have to pay
for Shit you're not using?

169
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,503
How about this?

170
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,400
How about we work out a really simple
way to do it where most people would save

171
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:50,070
money and we just do it by the minute.

172
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,240
Like whatever you use,

173
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,110
that's what you pay for.

174
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:53,400
And if you don't use that much,

175
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,210
you pay less.

176
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,080
And if you want to save money,

177
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:56,190
use your fucking phone less.

178
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:56,881
And they like,

179
00:04:56,881 --> 00:05:01,110
you could really do that and ting figured
out how to do it and I think that all

180
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:02,310
cell phone companies in the future,

181
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:03,510
I'm probably going to follow that model.

182
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,550
I think it's going to be one of those
things like remember he used to pay for

183
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:06,384
roaming,

184
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,550
he'd get in your phone
and you drive 20 minutes,

185
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:09,600
are you getting your car rather?

186
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:09,960
And you've had,

187
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,000
you have your phone on you at
20 minutes outside of the city,

188
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:12,834
you'd be roaming.

189
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,090
So it costs you like some
ridiculous amount of money.

190
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,313
Where'd all that go?

191
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,790
All that shit went away.

192
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,090
It had to go away because companies like
tin come along and they come up with a

193
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:21,924
better way to do it.

194
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,243
And um,

195
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,070
that's what I feel.

196
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,940
I think the minute,

197
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,700
the whole minute thing is going to go
away soon because I was just thinking,

198
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,240
know how many minutes I,

199
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:32,020
a month I use on my cell phone talking,

200
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,120
I barely talk on my phone.

201
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:35,860
I can take these a minute a month.

202
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,660
I bet 10 minutes a month.

203
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,380
No doubt.

204
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,980
I Bet I I use 10 minutes a month that
they charge for data now the same way they

205
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:43,000
used to charge for a minutes.

206
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,973
Yeah.

207
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,100
As minutes or like nothing.

208
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,311
Yeah,

209
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:45,491
man,

210
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:45,701
it's hard.

211
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:46,534
Nothing anymore.

212
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,590
I still don't totally understand.

213
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:48,820
And why

214
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,950
data is expensive.

215
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,720
It's confusing to me.

216
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,540
Like I get storing it
would be expensive and I,

217
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,080
boy,

218
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,950
I don't understand it.

219
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,431
I mean,

220
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,560
is it electricity?

221
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:00,861
I mean,

222
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,730
what does being used?

223
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:02,570
There's bandwidth,

224
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:02,960
right?

225
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,410
Yeah.

226
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,090
But what exactly is bandwidth?

227
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,310
Like this is how stupid I am stupid.

228
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:09,980
I am on something that I
rely on on a daily basis.

229
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,500
I don't know Jack Shit about
how the Internet works.

230
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:12,831
Yeah.

231
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,850
You're pretty much paying to use
computers to transfer data to you.

232
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,160
So it's using computers.

233
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,400
It's way over priced and
it should be definitely,

234
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:23,801
well,

235
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:24,470
the computer,

236
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,610
I don't know about all that
because imagine if you had
to reset it up yourself.

237
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,361
Hey,

238
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:30,194
you know

239
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,150
they quit,

240
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:31,510
right?

241
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,880
Everybody quit time to
make a new internet.

242
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,853
Yeah.

243
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,280
How much would it cost?

244
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,233
How Wa,

245
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,580
how could you ever come up
with four g on your own?

246
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,000
Not We,

247
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,970
we need these fuckers.

248
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,760
I Dunno how

249
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,880
it would be smoke signal.

250
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,630
That's the next step.

251
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,690
I'm like there's no internet.

252
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,790
I guess I'm yelling and starting fires.

253
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,230
Yelling louder shouldn't be.

254
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:53,430
We should be so happy.

255
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,670
People out there that are way smarter
than us to figure that fucking thing out.

256
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,110
We should be so happy.

257
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,410
You know we would have never
figured out the Internet.

258
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,730
There's some like that that just the
evidence that the Internet is real.

259
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,780
That is one of the best evidence is that
there are people that are just so far

260
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:12,330
beyond how fucking smart
you think smart is.

261
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,930
It's like remember when you were like
five or six years old you had like a lot

262
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,240
of times you had like this one kid in
the neighborhood that maybe it was like a

263
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,021
little bit bigger,

264
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:25,110
a little bit stronger than the other
kids and when you would play with them on

265
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:25,651
the field,

266
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:26,970
like you'd get like bummed out.

267
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:31,971
Like you get knocked over and shit like
remember what you thought that was like

268
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:33,480
that was a strong little kid.

269
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,920
But if you were there right now,

270
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,311
you'd be like,

271
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:35,761
get out of here.

272
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:38,100
You little fuck fuck
knocking in everybody,

273
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,453
you know.

274
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,973
You know what I mean?

275
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,460
I,

276
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,650
it was a more secured that he had
freckles or something like that.

277
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:43,830
Yeah.

278
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,161
He'd be like,

279
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:44,994
get out he fucking

280
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,750
Weirdo.

281
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,620
Don't be mean to me.

282
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:47,970
I'm a grown ass man.

283
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,850
But that's what I feel like,

284
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,730
like technologically and,

285
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,470
and just the mental capacity of a
super genius and comparison to me.

286
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,690
I feel like if a,

287
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,010
I'm that little kid and like if I tried
to figure out how the fuck they figured

288
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:05,551
out the Internet,

289
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,151
I just be like,

290
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:06,700
oh,

291
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,960
brain isn't worked out good.

292
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,520
I can't talk to you.

293
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,480
You're freaking me out,

294
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:11,314
man.

295
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:11,711
You know,

296
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:12,041
if you,

297
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,370
if you went into one of those dudes
offices and they had those crazy like

298
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,570
goodwill hunting shit on the wall and
he's doing those equations that fucking

299
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:20,860
nobody understands,

300
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,551
you know,

301
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:23,080
that they'll work on for years.

302
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,250
You know,

303
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,900
even the professor didn't like,

304
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:26,590
how did you,

305
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,940
what does fuck yeah.

306
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,260
I remember like in goodwill hunting,

307
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:30,094
the fucking dumb,

308
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,960
the janitor fixes the problem.

309
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,960
They leave it open to the
janitor can work on the problem.

310
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,213
Really?

311
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:36,611
Yeah.

312
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:37,720
What if he just erased it?

313
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,130
What if he's just crazy?

314
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,001
He's not.

315
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:41,200
Why you had channeled her bitch,

316
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,310
this is a stupid story.

317
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,820
Here's a super genius janitor.

318
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,210
Get the fuck Outta here.

319
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,231
The Fuck Outta here.

320
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:48,190
You're smarter than anybody.

321
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:50,590
You can figure out these equations
and nobody else can and you're also

322
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:51,330
beautiful,

323
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,163
right?

324
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,220
What are the odds and charming

325
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,580
anyway,

326
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,340
rogan.ting.com go get a phone.

327
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,233
They're awesome.

328
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,340
They have all the best android phones.

329
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,270
Uh,

330
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:03,751
and I said,

331
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,111
like I said,

332
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,840
this one I got that's a
waterproof is the galaxy s five

333
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,540
that's going to make the drought worse.

334
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,580
The galaxy s five [inaudible] in
the shower for like two hours.

335
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,800
I didn't even think about that.

336
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,220
Not worrying about like the pool and shit.

337
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah.

338
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,241
Yeah.

339
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:22,370
I mean I remember when
they were dipping phones,

340
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,230
there was like a company
that would dip them,

341
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,710
like dip your iPhone and then they would
send it back to you and essentially be

342
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:28,544
waterproof.

343
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,790
Is that what they,

344
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,940
that's probably what they did with Das.

345
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:32,650
They probably just dipped him maybe,

346
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,330
but did that work?

347
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:33,881
Probably work.

348
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:34,121
Yeah,

349
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:34,780
that's what I'm saying.

350
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,613
Did that work?

351
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,010
What?

352
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,000
Does anybody know what that worked?

353
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,500
I think for water resistance,

354
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,850
the it has to work.

355
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:41,530
It's not just dipping it.

356
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:41,741
I mean,

357
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:45,550
you could drop your phone in a toilet
like all of us have and it's still work,

358
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,001
you know?

359
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,080
So the dipping it,

360
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,240
I mean even if it's 99% accurate,

361
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:50,140
it's still probably going to,

362
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,033
you know,

363
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,983
work enough.

364
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,200
Yeah.

365
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,381
Yeah.

366
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:55,870
I bet the fine print
is like 20 pages long,

367
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:56,110
right?

368
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,900
It's gotta be under four minutes
and all these other guys.

369
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,240
Yeah.

370
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,511
Yeah.

371
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:02,900
It's probably got to be like under
30 meters or something like that.

372
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,800
Probably have like a,

373
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,740
like what's like a good waterproof depth
for a watch because they have squirrely

374
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,650
little rules.

375
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,410
So they'll say water
resistant up to 30 million.

376
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,050
Well listen,

377
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,580
bitch,

378
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,780
waterproof or not.

379
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,000
I guess it's like water pressure.

380
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:17,834
Is that what it is?

381
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,993
That shit's legit.

382
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,470
I mean it,

383
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:21,621
it,

384
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:21,951
it hurts.

385
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:23,810
Your ears probably would
fuck with your phone too.

386
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,683
It makes sense.

387
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,280
Anyway,

388
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,840
rogan.ting.com go there and save
25 bucks off a new tank phone.

389
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,700
He'd dirty savages.

390
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,680
And last but not least,

391
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:35,180
we're brought to you by on at.com.

392
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:35,601
It's O,

393
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,260
n n,

394
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,480
I t ana is what you would call it,

395
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,310
a human optimization website.

396
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,610
We sell strength and
conditioning equipment.

397
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:48,500
We sell delicious snacks and
foods like the warrior bar,

398
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,340
which is this,

399
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,630
somebody actually brought this up.

400
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,310
I think this is a,

401
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:53,180
an important point.

402
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,650
Somebody brought this up to me on Twitter.

403
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,920
There's no added nitrates in,

404
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:58,754
um,

405
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,110
in these buffalo bars,

406
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:05,111
but there's naturally occurring nitrates
that occur in sea salt and celery.

407
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:07,761
So,

408
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:07,941
uh,

409
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:09,560
that's something to consider.

410
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,640
And also like,

411
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,650
I don't know whether or not,

412
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,540
like I was saying on this,

413
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,110
uh,

414
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,180
this ad before when I
would read it before,

415
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,910
one of the points is
that it has no nitrates.

416
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,320
And I don't know exactly if nitrates are
actually bad for you in natural form.

417
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,560
I don't know if they're bad for you and
sea salt form or bathroom salary or if

418
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:27,861
it's just,

419
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:28,690
uh,

420
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,331
an amount thing.

421
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:31,970
And I think that's a good
question for a doctor,

422
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:32,301
Rhonda,

423
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:33,134
Patrick,

424
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,741
and she's,

425
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:33,980
uh,

426
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,880
she's going to be coming back.

427
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:35,860
We're exchanging email,

428
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,930
so hopefully I can get an answer
for from her on this kind of stuff.

429
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,850
When it comes to health and anything,

430
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:45,790
like anything that's
controversial diets and you know,

431
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,200
and supplementation and
things along those lines,

432
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,150
I can't stress enough.

433
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,100
If you've got any questions
about that kind of shit,

434
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:54,580
you got to Google it and
you to read both sides.

435
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,080
It's not comfortable to do.

436
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:56,980
It's annoying.

437
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,981
Like say if you,

438
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:00,820
you think that like taking vitamin
D is good for you and you're like,

439
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:01,041
wow,

440
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:01,420
I look,

441
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:01,931
let me go see,

442
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:02,081
oh,

443
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,850
there's a bunch of papers to
say vitamin D is good for him.

444
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,661
He got to read.

445
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:05,980
Vitamin D is Bad for you.

446
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,850
You got to read his vitamin D bad
for you and read that to read,

447
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:09,910
read whatever papers,

448
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:10,930
whatever studies they have.

449
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,100
If you don't,

450
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,210
you're kind of guessing.

451
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,190
Or if you know someone
like Rhonda Patrick,

452
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:15,910
you can ask her.

453
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,900
That's why she's awesome.

454
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,120
Isn't nitrates what make you have boners?

455
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,111
No,

456
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:21,160
that's nitric oxide.

457
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:21,371
Boy.

458
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,510
I'm glad you're not a fucking doctor.

459
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,100
You gave him some shit
that makes beef Jerky,

460
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,934
dude.

461
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,800
No wonder his dick didn't
get our vitamin D bad.

462
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,350
Free.

463
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,510
No.

464
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:32,860
Dot.

465
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,790
Vitamin D excellent.

466
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,700
It's the thing that most people are
deficient in apparently according to

467
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,920
numerous studies.

468
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:40,150
They say that most people,

469
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,240
like 70% of the population
does not get enough vitamin D.

470
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,100
When I just had,

471
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,891
I had my physical,

472
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:46,330
that's the only thing
that was wrong with me.

473
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,040
Everybody do it.

474
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,970
It's super common.

475
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,110
We're not getting enough sun.

476
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,030
People were supposed to be
on the sun all the time,

477
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:52,810
you know,

478
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,740
we're scared.

479
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:54,730
Everyone's scared of camp.

480
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,090
I don't want to get the
kid outside dairy too.

481
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:58,390
Right.

482
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,410
You get it a lot from dairy.

483
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,010
Doesn't dare give you cancer.

484
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,430
No,

485
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,551
no.

486
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:04,210
Vitamin D.

487
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:04,571
Yes.

488
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:05,530
You get it from milk,

489
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,250
so I'm probably very deficient
and the cows are you really?

490
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,090
Yeah,

491
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,923
I'm getting there.

492
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,130
You should get your blood work done,

493
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:12,490
man.

494
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:12,701
Gay.

495
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:13,540
You should check it out.

496
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,070
If anybody's ever interested in
really getting healthy and fit,

497
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,930
getting your diet checked out,

498
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:20,380
getting,

499
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,681
you know,

500
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:21,760
getting your blood work done,

501
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,830
finding out where your
nutritional levels are.

502
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:24,281
Eat like a,

503
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,270
you normally would eat.

504
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,350
Don't try to trick them.

505
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,570
He like you would normally,

506
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,410
oh old about Kale,

507
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:30,244
bro.

508
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,050
I'm all about organic celery.

509
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,610
But get your,

510
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:33,911
you know,

511
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:37,390
go to a reputable place and get your
blood work done and find out where your

512
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,740
nutrients are lacking.

513
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:39,730
It's really important.

514
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,730
A lot of times you think you have a
good diet and you're just being naive.

515
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,410
Start looking at your diet and you go,

516
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,651
oh,

517
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:45,820
I eat a lot of shit.

518
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,900
I never thought I had it.

519
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,300
Good die while you're one up.

520
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,890
They went up on a delusional.

521
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:51,580
Folks,

522
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,290
I'll have one for four days and I go,

523
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,930
now I deserve to eat a whole
pot or something terrible.

524
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,490
There you go.

525
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,323
See a lot of wooden bed.

526
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,000
Um,

527
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,320
so the warrior bars,

528
00:13:59,380 --> 00:13:59,770
uh,

529
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,820
what we were talking about,

530
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:02,170
so take that into consideration.

531
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:03,320
But they do have a,

532
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,810
are 140 calories,

533
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,920
a four grams of fat and too
uncertain with 14 grams of protein,

534
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:09,754
which is a lot.

535
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,290
Yeah,

536
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,200
that's really healthy.

537
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,621
And it's,

538
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:11,980
um,

539
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,510
it's just natural,

540
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:13,750
uh,

541
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,600
buffalo with cranberries and,

542
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:16,811
uh,

543
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:17,071
this,

544
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:18,910
this ancient recipe that,

545
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:19,150
uh,

546
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,560
look the code of people,

547
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,810
the Lakota a native Americans used
to preserve their buffalo with.

548
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,720
It's delicious.

549
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,570
It tastes good and it's really guilt free.

550
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,380
Um,

551
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,670
as far as like nitrates,

552
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:32,050
it's salary and salt.

553
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,770
It's a v.

554
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,750
All very good question and I'm
going to have to look into that.

555
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,360
I had substance use it.

556
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,930
I would say don't be a pussy.

557
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,640
Don't worry about salary and salt.

558
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,070
[inaudible] worried about salary,

559
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:43,990
fucking sea salt and salary.

560
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:46,450
If those are the two things that are
going to take you out in this game,

561
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,870
how weak is your defense son?

562
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,310
How weak?

563
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,393
Um,

564
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,150
we sell a lot of shit on it that we find,

565
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:55,500
uh,

566
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,960
you can find other places.

567
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,470
Uh,

568
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,260
but what we tried to do is just get the,

569
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:01,010
the best versions of it available,

570
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,971
like hemp force,

571
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:02,840
protein powders.

572
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:03,110
Uh,

573
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,600
an important one when it comes to that.

574
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,910
You can get hemp protein
from other places,

575
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:10,310
but a lot of times it's super gritty.

576
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,270
Uh,

577
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,100
it's not that easy to digest,

578
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:14,480
to assist a different texture.

579
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:15,770
It feels different when you drink it.

580
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:16,430
Uh,

581
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,610
it's just because it's not the highest
quality of the stuff that we buy.

582
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,541
Cost more money,

583
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,930
but it's higher in protein and it's,

584
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,130
it's easy to digest.

585
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,340
It's super powdery.

586
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,240
It's really interesting the difference
between the hemp force protein powder

587
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:29,470
and,

588
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,660
uh,

589
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,750
I've used some powders from some other
companies that use the cheaper shits,

590
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:33,770
like just more cores,

591
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,910
more fiber in it.

592
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,931
And it's a,

593
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:36,231
you know,

594
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:38,540
it's like you've tasted in your
mouth and you're drinking grit.

595
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:39,571
Uh,

596
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,000
but as far as like the,

597
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:42,590
your body's ability to digest it,

598
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,080
I think it's the easiest
form of protein to digest.

599
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,720
My body has zero problems.

600
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,590
I can,

601
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,590
I can drink a hemp force protein shake
with coconut water and work out in like

602
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,040
an hour.

603
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,701
That's never,

604
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:56,534
I can't do,

605
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,990
there's nothing else I can eat or I
can work out in an hour and it can be

606
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:03,470
comfortable about it because
the stuff just digest so easily.

607
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,850
Like I love way.

608
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:05,840
I'd love like those,

609
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:06,674
um,

610
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,530
muscle milk's,

611
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,690
those are fucking delicious.

612
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,583
Those tastes good.

613
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,610
But my body does not react
that well to that stuff.

614
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,150
Like,

615
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,910
you know,

616
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,600
what was the difference you notice
between muscle milk and the hemp then?

617
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,660
No farts.

618
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,200
Okay,

619
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,040
let's be real big.

620
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:20,760
Will make you sick.

621
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,690
Let's get crazy.

622
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,710
I would fart like crazy when
I would drink the way pre,

623
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:25,950
remember Tate's farts.

624
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,060
There's still legendary.

625
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,840
It's all weight.

626
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,673
They smell.

627
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,390
It's all whey protein men.

628
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:30,840
Um,

629
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,471
but I like it.

630
00:16:31,471 --> 00:16:31,690
I like it.

631
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,231
Whey protein.

632
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:33,130
I'm not saying it's bad,

633
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:34,960
but as far as digestibility,

634
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:35,940
oh,

635
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,740
hemp force is my favorite
shit of all time.

636
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,090
Whether I was selling or not,

637
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:42,130
I would tell you that
it's fucking fantastic.

638
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,240
Um,

639
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,960
so that's it.

640
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,140
Go to [inaudible] dot com o n
n I t used the Codeword Rogan,

641
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:50,340
and you can save 10% off any
and all supplements and a,

642
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,790
what are the economy dates
you've got coming up,

643
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,110
Brian?

644
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,320
Uh,

645
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,880
this weekend we're going to be in Tampa,

646
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:54,600
Florida,

647
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,050
Meagan,

648
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:55,411
Sam,

649
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:56,120
Tripoli.

650
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,610
Uh,

651
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,121
Friday.

652
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:57,811
It's Tampa.

653
00:16:57,811 --> 00:16:58,351
Saturday,

654
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,370
it's Jacksonville,

655
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:02,100
and then Sunday is a Orlando.

656
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,680
And you can go to Jess squad.

657
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:03,841
Dot.

658
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:06,320
TV for tools or for Laura

659
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,870
and ring penicillins.

660
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,030
But those are the,

661
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,863
that's like Lord,

662
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,720
that's like up higher,

663
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:12,961
right?

664
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:13,990
Like those are okay.

665
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,060
You're the craziest.

666
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,010
The craziest of the ones up high.

667
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,173
Really?

668
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,380
Orlando's in the middle.

669
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,483
Yeah.

670
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,660
Orlando is a good spot.

671
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,833
Yeah.

672
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:23,760
You know what?

673
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,050
But South Florida is fun too,

674
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:25,680
man.

675
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,513
They're fun.

676
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,380
I enjoy doing shows down there.

677
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,333
People are crazy.

678
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,750
It's a totally different world.

679
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,180
It's a completely different
world than the rest of America.

680
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,230
It really is.

681
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,620
Yeah.

682
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,260
South Florida's wild and all the bad ways.

683
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:37,861
Like Florida,

684
00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:38,191
man.

685
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,720
You follow that Florida
man Twitter account?

686
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,333
Yeah.

687
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,680
I mean there's just no denying.

688
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:45,520
I mean I would,

689
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,400
I would like to have
someone like Sam Harris,

690
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,370
some like really rational guy break down

691
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,430
why Florida actually has no more crime.

692
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,670
It's just that for whatever
reason people focus on Florida.

693
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,590
But I don't know if
that's entirely accurate.

694
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,140
The sheer numbers of idiocy that
you get this just a numbers,

695
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,650
a moron to come out of Florida.

696
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,840
It's almost hard to believe,

697
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:07,000
right?

698
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,350
Watched almost every single episode
of Cops and Florida is always the best

699
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,223
episodes.

700
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,831
That's a great show.

701
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:14,220
By the way.

702
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,040
They should do it as long as they,

703
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,200
they,

704
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,510
they,

705
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:21,510
they re edited all the old episodes of
cops and like made an HD and edit them

706
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:23,310
real fast and quick now.

707
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,960
So it's called cops reloaded.

708
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,710
It's,

709
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,543
Oh,

710
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,700
I wonder how much they
could do just on Florida.

711
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,330
Oh,

712
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,750
because it picked out from every other,

713
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,190
if you could just have camera's running
24 hours a day and hire some editors,

714
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,950
just keep the cameras on.

715
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,360
You would never go wrong.

716
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,380
I mean Wacky Shit happens in Florida
all like if you were a vice cop in Miami

717
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,070
and you had a camera on your car,

718
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,503
like how much?

719
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,010
We don't need to do commercials anymore.

720
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,310
We're here.

721
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,040
Um,

722
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,873
we don't need the music.

723
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,540
Fuck it.

724
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:54,990
Um,

725
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,500
but if you are a vice cop and you were
in Miami and they just put a camera on

726
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,070
your head,

727
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,960
how much wacky shit
would you see every year?

728
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,160
Probably be madness.

729
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:02,431
Oh,

730
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:02,731
every,

731
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:05,700
I mean it would be every other
day there'd be something amazing,

732
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,593
crazy.

733
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,920
Like everyone should just have a GoPro
on their head and just be traveling.

734
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:11,930
And I do

735
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,201
know,

736
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:17,000
and a lot of states they said that's
lowered the instances of police harassment

737
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,430
or police brutality substantially.

738
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,570
And I know,

739
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,460
I believe Los Angeles has some,

740
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,510
some sort of program,

741
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,840
at least on some of the officers
where they put these cameras on them.

742
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,411
You know,

743
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:30,860
we're starting to see so much
video of cops beating people up,

744
00:19:30,861 --> 00:19:31,101
man.

745
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:32,340
It's really disturbed.

746
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,110
It is.

747
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,070
It's so disturbing.

748
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:38,720
Like that one cop that beat that
lady up on the side of the freeway,

749
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,810
it was seen that one.

750
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:40,821
Fuck,

751
00:19:40,821 --> 00:19:41,810
Holy Shit.

752
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:45,980
She might've been mentally challenged and
she was acting like she was walking in

753
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:46,820
the on the freeway.

754
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,430
I don't know what her deal was.

755
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,031
I don't know.

756
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:52,820
But if that is the only way
that he can control her,

757
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:54,080
she shouldn't be a cop.

758
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,970
Like you can't just fucking waylay
somebody in the face over and over again

759
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:01,160
while you're holding on to their
neck on the side of the highway.

760
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,030
You just can't do that.

761
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,133
That's,

762
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,790
that's not defensive.

763
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,420
You're not like,

764
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,130
you're not saving them from themselves.

765
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:08,300
You're not saving anybody from the,

766
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:09,170
you're assaulting them.

767
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,040
You know,

768
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,870
like you should be able
to contain that woman.

769
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:13,640
A woman wasn't as striking him at all.

770
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,590
If you had any,

771
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,041
you know,

772
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,810
knowledge of Jujitsu whatsoever,

773
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:18,830
you would just contain her.

774
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:20,120
It'd be really easy to do.

775
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:20,511
I mean,

776
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,720
you might get hit with some
clawing at you and shit,

777
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,880
but you could hold her in place and
nobody has to get hurt if you're a cop.

778
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,740
It's not like that
woman was attacking him.

779
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,011
You know,

780
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:32,180
if that one was attacking him,

781
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:35,220
like say if that woman had a bat or a
knife or something and she's coming at him

782
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,830
and he took her down and
punch her in the face,

783
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:37,820
I'm all for that.

784
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:38,660
That's a Dane.

785
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,800
That might as well be an animal.

786
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:41,750
A person that's attacking
you with a weapon.

787
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,010
Might as well be an animal.

788
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,620
That's how I feel like if would you
kick a dog that tried to bite you?

789
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,610
Fuck yeah.

790
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,910
A with a knife that's coming at you.

791
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:50,320
It doesn't matter if
it's a man or a woman.

792
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,020
They're getting punched in
their fucking face for real.

793
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,410
Right.

794
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,400
It Ha you have to.

795
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,100
Otherwise you're a dead man Brian.

796
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,620
Yes.

797
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,930
Is running an option cause
I'd like to just run away.

798
00:20:59,820 --> 00:20:59,990
Yeah,

799
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,240
you could run faster.

800
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:01,991
Definitely do.

801
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:02,201
Okay,

802
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:02,411
cool.

803
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:03,244
I'll do that.

804
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,330
Side to side.

805
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,620
If you've got a good Juke,

806
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,440
but at the end of the day,

807
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:09,550
like if you're a cop,

808
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,070
you can't just beat somebody up like that.

809
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,390
You just can't do that.

810
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:13,811
Like,

811
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:16,000
that lady's not hitting you like you,

812
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,481
like she's,

813
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:18,550
which wouldn't listen
like what's going on?

814
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:22,870
Like there's no way she could've been
doing anything that's that justified

815
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,280
getting a fuck beat out of her life.

816
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,130
Isn't there like some police force that's
now putting Gopros on all the cops?

817
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,400
Like they,

818
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,200
their whole forest.

819
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,140
You have to have like a GoPro
camera on your person now.

820
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,003
We should probably Google.

821
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,953
He keeps saying,

822
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,721
I just heard it.

823
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:36,831
The,

824
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:37,470
it'd be great.

825
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:37,920
Yeah,

826
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,180
that makes so much more sense.

827
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,710
I don't know.

828
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,300
And would,

829
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,260
would it would,

830
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,400
it should be something that broadcasts.

831
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,340
Yeah,

832
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:45,870
that'd be cool.

833
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,380
Yeah,

834
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,990
because subscribed to that would
be the best cops by the way.

835
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,400
Ever,

836
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,233
ever.

837
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,361
You go home.

838
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:53,790
I want to see what's going
on in my hometown cops.

839
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:57,530
You could just stream
it Compton really low.

840
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,411
It's pretty bad.

841
00:21:58,411 --> 00:22:00,480
Cops use go pros to film traffic.

842
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:00,900
Stop.

843
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,111
Oh,

844
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:01,944
this is different.

845
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,310
I think it was Florida actually,

846
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:06,450
that now that I think about it.

847
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,284
That was doing it.

848
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,910
Florida police camera.

849
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,040
Look at this.

850
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,180
Uh,

851
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,630
copies is a Gopro to film a
traffic stop of a lieutenant cop.

852
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,081
Uh,

853
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:16,700
Miami police officer,

854
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,980
he made a routine traffic stop.

855
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,310
He discovered that it's
a man of superior rank,

856
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,740
like a cop that superior ranked him.

857
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,040
They start fighting and he got suspended.

858
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,431
Yeah,

859
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,120
I saw that.

860
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,430
And the lieutenant is merely reassigned,

861
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,850
huh?

862
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,001
Yeah,

863
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:34,260
he filmed the whole thing too.

864
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,410
And this,

865
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,880
the hierarchy,

866
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,190
like that's like a weird thing to
rank thing for police officers.

867
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,020
Like that's some military shit.

868
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,120
Like the whole rank thing like that.

869
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,500
He had to like,

870
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,550
you know,

871
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,620
give in to a superior officer.

872
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,560
Like that's what the issue is.

873
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,720
A superior rank.

874
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,460
How weird is that?

875
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,480
Like a guide

876
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,740
general or the person ran a red light,

877
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,760
like let's calm down.

878
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,641
I mean,

879
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:03,160
I guess

880
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,120
cops should be able to get
better positions as they
get better at their job and

881
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:12,121
they should get more prestige as they
get more experience and knowledge officer

882
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:15,400
went out to California now required
to wear video cameras while on,

883
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,850
see it's right in the middle and it says,

884
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:20,370
just like full on Gopro that
just records every time.

885
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,340
One year use

886
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,101
of force of drops,

887
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:25,270
60% complaints have dropped 88%.

888
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:25,540
Wow.

889
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,740
Holy Shit.

890
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,840
Holy Shit.

891
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,620
Wow.

892
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,640
That's accountability,

893
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:31,081
man.

894
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:31,750
Yeah,

895
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,980
it's all about accountability.

896
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:34,150
That's exactly what that is.

897
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,043
You know,

898
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,530
it's not that,

899
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:41,530
that's being a cop is a tricky decision
to be the guy who decides how things get

900
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:44,170
handled and times of stress.

901
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:45,160
And that's your job.

902
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,220
You do that every day.

903
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,181
You come in,

904
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:48,140
people are screaming,

905
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:49,130
wives and husbands,

906
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:50,930
are you worried you're going to get shot?

907
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,820
Like they're always worried
they're going to get shot.

908
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,890
Like domestic violence cases especially,

909
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,621
he imagined,

910
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:57,260
I have anything to do
with these crazy people,

911
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,880
but the neighbors' lights are all on,

912
00:23:58,881 --> 00:23:59,990
it's five o'clock in the morning,

913
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,160
people are screaming,

914
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:02,900
they're throwing shit and you know,

915
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:03,131
you're,

916
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:06,410
you hear the guy say I'm gonna fucking
kill you and you're outside and you're a

917
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:07,790
cop and you're like,

918
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,110
Jesus Christ here.

919
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:10,490
We got like that's your job.

920
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,120
That's cool.

921
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,260
That's a crazy job.

922
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,570
It's hard for anybody,

923
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:19,520
I think to expect that people that go
through that job on a daily basis or

924
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:23,810
perfect or they should be held to the
same standards as everybody else as far as

925
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:26,790
like their ability to tolerate
bullshit cause they get,

926
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,670
they see too much.

927
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,750
Yeah,

928
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,800
that's a crazy job.

929
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:31,971
It's crazy job.

930
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:36,080
And so you know when people
look at pro police brutality,

931
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,820
you got to look at the cops too.

932
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:39,590
Like what are these
guys being subjected to?

933
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:45,070
It's not just that these cops are
lashing out and attacking people.

934
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:49,070
It's like what's making
them ramp up their,

935
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,970
their violence.

936
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:51,170
So they just inherently violent.

937
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,360
That's a real convenient
way to look at it,

938
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,630
to just decide they're just inherently
violent and that they're assholes and

939
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:58,520
bullies and that's why they
became cops in the first place.

940
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,590
And that might be correct for some,

941
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,970
but you also got to take
into consideration what
they're seeing on a daily

942
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:05,420
basis.

943
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,210
Their fucking job is to deal with the
worst situations that people have to see

944
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:10,990
every day,

945
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:11,720
every day.

946
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,553
Bullets,

947
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,700
car accidents,

948
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,990
motorcycle wreck,

949
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,920
violence,

950
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,670
murder,

951
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,460
suicide.

952
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:17,611
Yeah,

953
00:25:17,611 --> 00:25:18,990
the worst parts of humanity.

954
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:20,430
All the worst liars,

955
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:21,061
liars,

956
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:21,781
thieves,

957
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:22,680
rapists,

958
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,873
all day.

959
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,860
It's got to be overwhelming.

960
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,960
And then for them to be,

961
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,530
you know,

962
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,530
in a situation with a person
and the person is like,

963
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:32,670
y'all don't have to listen to you.

964
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,361
Oh you don't,

965
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:34,194
you fucking pitch.

966
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,660
He's like,

967
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,370
they're so wound up,

968
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,260
they're always at like eight.

969
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,131
You know,

970
00:25:41,131 --> 00:25:46,131
if you live in that world and you're
constantly like dodging this and evading

971
00:25:46,321 --> 00:25:51,321
that and capturing this guy and pulling
that guy off the street and fuck man,

972
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,171
what,

973
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:55,740
it's why it surprises me when when
you see cops that are so young,

974
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,930
when there's like a 21 year old,

975
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,610
22 year old cop and you're like,

976
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,520
that guy is going to be able
to handle all this stress.

977
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,410
Like the domestic violence thing.

978
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:05,700
Like he'd show up to a house,

979
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,640
husband and wife are arguing and it's
like that kids probably had sex twice and

980
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,290
he's supposed to like
know what to do during a,

981
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,121
yeah.

982
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:19,100
I wonder if they have people that they
specifically assigned to those kinds of

983
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:20,870
cases that are like good at that shit.

984
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:21,411
Okay.

985
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:22,040
Yeah.

986
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,851
Does that make sense?

987
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:23,360
But I would,

988
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,130
that's like an Al Pachino role and heat.

989
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,891
No,

990
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:27,101
I'm in,

991
00:26:27,101 --> 00:26:27,934
can I talk to you?

992
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:28,820
You know,

993
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,050
get,

994
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,390
get the guy to the window
and put the gun down.

995
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,200
Norman.

996
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,990
You know there's a lot of cops here.

997
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,110
You know,

998
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,460
it'd be like the guy who likes
slowly talk to you off the ledge.

999
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,650
I bet in real life cop world though,

1000
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:43,530
it's like what is it is a murder.

1001
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:44,670
There's no specialists.

1002
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,061
Like,

1003
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:45,331
dude,

1004
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:46,560
I don't even do robbery.

1005
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,970
I'm not doing robbery.

1006
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,601
I'm over here.

1007
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:49,860
I'm doing violent crime.

1008
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,370
Yeah.

1009
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,390
Not Nothing petty.

1010
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,410
I know they're cops.

1011
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,244
They show up where this,

1012
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:53,881
you know,

1013
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:55,500
there's like vice departments,

1014
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:55,861
right?

1015
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:57,930
And they have like different departments,

1016
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,950
but for the most part they
all deal with bullshit.

1017
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,661
That's what they do.

1018
00:27:02,661 --> 00:27:04,090
Hold closer to the crime,

1019
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,470
just get there and deal with it.

1020
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,630
Deal with nonsense all day,

1021
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,100
deal with the worst of us.

1022
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,570
And every time they talk to
people that people are lying.

1023
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,520
Like most of the time,

1024
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,710
most of the time people
were talking to cops.

1025
00:27:17,711 --> 00:27:18,544
They're lying.

1026
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:18,911
Yeah.

1027
00:27:18,911 --> 00:27:23,260
I don't think I've ever talked to a cop
when it hasn't been like I'm on the end

1028
00:27:23,261 --> 00:27:24,580
of getting in trouble and I'm like,

1029
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:25,414
how do I get out of it?

1030
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,790
I've never just been like,

1031
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:28,420
hey officer,

1032
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,721
nice,

1033
00:27:28,721 --> 00:27:29,650
nice to see it today.

1034
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,880
I've never done that.

1035
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,770
That's funny.

1036
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:31,891
Yeah.

1037
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:34,200
There's a lot of people's
interaction with cops on the street,

1038
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:34,590
man.

1039
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,550
That's a lot of people's,

1040
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:36,330
uh,

1041
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:36,991
if you think about it,

1042
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:40,230
remember that video that kid was taking
a video of the woman was beaten him up

1043
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,160
and uh,

1044
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,731
she was,

1045
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:42,060
uh,

1046
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,320
she was screaming,

1047
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:43,781
you know,

1048
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:45,210
at him and he was like,

1049
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,260
stop hitting me please.

1050
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:46,381
Dot.

1051
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,990
And it's all he was doing and she was
saying that she was going to say that he

1052
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:50,160
sexually assaulted her.

1053
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:50,710
Yeah.

1054
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,090
Remember they,

1055
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,280
the other one that we showed that,

1056
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,971
that uh,

1057
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,450
that the old women's
stealing the guys stuff,

1058
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,300
they've,

1059
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,220
that reddit guys at reddit found her
name and her Facebook and from when it

1060
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,530
started going to her page,

1061
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,890
and it's ridiculous because he's like,

1062
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,320
it looks like she's just a normal woman
that just happened to be like stealing

1063
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:09,930
shit.

1064
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,670
What do you know what?

1065
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,860
That's a weird thing about people's looks.

1066
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,730
There's like some sweetie pie look
and people that are killer Ted Bundy.

1067
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,021
Perfect example.

1068
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:18,680
Yeah,

1069
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,513
yeah.

1070
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,541
I've met like,

1071
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:21,260
uh,

1072
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,000
there's a lot of MMA guys like that too.

1073
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,190
Like you would never know Jujitsu guys.

1074
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,540
There's a lot of Jujitsu guys.

1075
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:27,590
Like you would never know.

1076
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:28,161
You look at them,

1077
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:30,350
they just look like normal
dudes and they would,

1078
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,700
they could kill people and it's just
like there's something about their head

1079
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,310
like they ha it's not just
their physical abilities,

1080
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:38,144
it's like their head,

1081
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,200
they have like little,

1082
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,520
little something extra,

1083
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,550
a little piece of wood,

1084
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,423
but they look like,

1085
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:42,951
you know,

1086
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:43,730
oop.

1087
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,460
You know,

1088
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,740
it's like all American boy,

1089
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,710
I'm click a total normal
sweet faced fella,

1090
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,820
you know,

1091
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,620
meanwhile they're just stone cold killers.

1092
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,350
Some old lady could be a dirty murderer.

1093
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,340
Know you're looking at her on the
beach and she's like someone's grammy.

1094
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,170
Like where's your grandparents?

1095
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,180
Oh they're over there by that tent.

1096
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:02,481
Oh,

1097
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:03,380
hi grammy.

1098
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,520
And that's her.

1099
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,030
Meanwhile she's a dirty stinky
thief stealing someone's tent,

1100
00:29:08,031 --> 00:29:08,864
packing it up.

1101
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,550
And then she's done it before obviously.

1102
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:11,870
Cause then that guy came up to her.

1103
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,460
She wasn't surprised,

1104
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:13,970
you know,

1105
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,090
she was like playing it
off like what this is ours.

1106
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,740
I'm pretty sure this is ours.

1107
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,570
This is our stuff.

1108
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,290
Fucking,

1109
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:22,760
I mean,

1110
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,331
you know,

1111
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:23,661
it had been,

1112
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,800
it was a complicated tent.

1113
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:27,850
They got like fucking posts and Shit and
they're folded everything up and put it

1114
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:30,670
in bags and stuff and
it's all dirty broads.

1115
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:33,630
Just stealing shit

1116
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,720
probably has gotten away with
that for the last 15 years.

1117
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,320
Yeah.

1118
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,400
After you hit a certain age,

1119
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,170
no one suspects you right.

1120
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,030
That's an innocent old person's not going

1121
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,480
to steal anything.

1122
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,081
Well,

1123
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:47,110
people become dose and
they don't even know why.

1124
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:52,090
Like I had a girl that I was dating when
when I was in high school that had a

1125
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:54,040
bit of an issue at one point in time.

1126
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,690
And she was a very good person.

1127
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,280
She went a bad person at all.

1128
00:29:57,281 --> 00:30:00,370
She's not like a bad kid from a bad home,

1129
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,450
but she wanted something and she didn't
have the money and she just took it,

1130
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,710
you know?

1131
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,820
And it was just this thing where like
she did it a couple of times and she got

1132
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,631
in trouble for it.

1133
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:12,250
She didn't get arrested
but she got caught.

1134
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:13,450
She would give the stuff back.

1135
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,291
I don't remember.

1136
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,110
It wasn't,

1137
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,830
wasn't anything monumental,

1138
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,090
but it was enough where she was trying
to understand why she was doing this.

1139
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,240
Like I can't,

1140
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,150
I almost can't stop.

1141
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,220
Like I go in the store and
there's something I want
and I know no one's looking.

1142
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,590
I figured out a way to
get it and I'm like that.

1143
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,463
That's crazy.

1144
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,460
Like that stealing.

1145
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,360
But she is,

1146
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,360
it was like when they say Kleptomania
like for some folks it really is an issue.

1147
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:45,130
Like they really can get obsessed with
this idea of stealing something and they

1148
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:45,641
can't help.

1149
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:45,830
It

1150
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,370
shall ideas.

1151
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:50,310
He has to do it all the
allegedly all the time at the,

1152
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,250
I like the airport would just be like,

1153
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,730
he would just be stuffing hamburgers
in his pockets and you're just like,

1154
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:58,210
what the fuck are you
worried about this Brian?

1155
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,820
Or he'll just go and get to one of
those little stands where they have like

1156
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:05,540
drinks and popcorn and stuff and he's
just putting stuff in his pockets like

1157
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:06,351
right in the open,

1158
00:31:06,351 --> 00:31:09,530
like not because it's about the thrill.

1159
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,340
It's not even like,

1160
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,360
oh I need this thing.

1161
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,560
Is it like the adrenaline?

1162
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:13,490
Can I get away with it?

1163
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:13,790
Let's

1164
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,581
say this about Joey,

1165
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,790
that was a long time ago
and he's a different guy.

1166
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,920
No role at all anymore,

1167
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,191
right?

1168
00:31:19,191 --> 00:31:19,671
I don't know.

1169
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:19,881
You know,

1170
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:21,500
the girl was 17 at the time.

1171
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,220
Um,

1172
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,053
and like I said,

1173
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,400
she's not a bad person by any
stretch of the imagination.

1174
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,330
She's very nice.

1175
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,040
She's very smart too.

1176
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,400
She just had a thing and that
thing was she wanted to steal shit.

1177
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,890
And I don't think,

1178
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,310
you know,

1179
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,390
it could be a combination.

1180
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,253
First of all,

1181
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,220
when you're 17,

1182
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:38,750
you're essentially insane,

1183
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,680
you know,

1184
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,041
I mean,

1185
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:43,280
you really are not sure what's going
on for the last couple of years.

1186
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:46,700
Your body's been overwhelmed
with hormones and you're like,

1187
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:47,780
what is that?

1188
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:47,991
Like,

1189
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:50,660
why do I feel so different than I did,

1190
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,051
you know,

1191
00:31:51,051 --> 00:31:52,340
just two or three years ago.

1192
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:54,710
And you're obsessed with girls,

1193
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:55,100
right?

1194
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,840
And girls are obsessed with boys and so
you've just start fooling around having

1195
00:31:59,841 --> 00:32:04,841
sex and it becomes like your whole life
becomes obsessive when you're young and

1196
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,670
you're about to become an adult and
you're going to have to take care of

1197
00:32:07,671 --> 00:32:07,970
yourself.

1198
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,301
And you're like,

1199
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:08,900
what?

1200
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,520
Nobody taught me shit.

1201
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:15,550
I just want to fuck all the dumb 17 I'm
almost 18 then I got to fend for myself,

1202
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,211
you know,

1203
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:21,590
and then graduations out and you take
your deep breath and you try to figure it

1204
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:21,831
out.

1205
00:32:21,831 --> 00:32:22,461
Like wow,

1206
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:23,294
what next?

1207
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,440
They're all crazy.

1208
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,910
Everyone that age is crazy.

1209
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:30,590
So some of them steal clothes and some
of them sniff paint and some of them,

1210
00:32:30,591 --> 00:32:31,041
you know,

1211
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:33,290
whatever become cops that beat people.

1212
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,310
That's a little harder than you can't be
more than 17 how old do you have to be

1213
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:38,144
to be a cop?

1214
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,380
Alright.

1215
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:39,800
I think,

1216
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,160
I think

1217
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,890
ACP 14 if you can join the military,

1218
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:43,460
yeah,

1219
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,970
she'll be 40 she'll be 40
year old dudes are yoked.

1220
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,170
They're like hiring and
Burbank cops right now.

1221
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,170
There's signs everywhere
that says now hiring.

1222
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:53,030
I'm sure it's probably a tough job.

1223
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,050
It's probably tough to get
people to do because uh,

1224
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,720
you know,

1225
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,080
I don't think most of us
have the perspective to
understand what they have to go

1226
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:00,740
through.

1227
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,490
So I think a lot of people also treat
cops would like to stains kind of cool to

1228
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:05,750
treat cops with disdain,

1229
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,730
but that's all well and good.

1230
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:08,780
But if the shit hit the fan,

1231
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:10,430
you'd be fucking happy they were cops.

1232
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,210
Oh yeah,

1233
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:11,420
yeah.

1234
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:11,901
I remember that.

1235
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:12,980
North Hollywood shootout.

1236
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,060
Remember that shit?

1237
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,451
Oh yeah.

1238
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,320
With the autumn,

1239
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,970
fully automatic weapons.

1240
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,863
Do you remember that Brian?

1241
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,333
Like video game,

1242
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,671
dude,

1243
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:24,410
we were on a news radio was on the set
of news radio and I forget who told us it

1244
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:24,861
was happening,

1245
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:28,310
but we all gathered up in this break
room to watch this and we were watching

1246
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:29,240
this on a TV,

1247
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,710
someone's office or something.

1248
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:31,720
I remember where we were watching.

1249
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,151
We were like,

1250
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:34,640
this is fucking crazy.

1251
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,800
Like we were all holding
our hands in our heads.

1252
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:36,981
Like,

1253
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,150
what are we looking at?

1254
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,340
This dude's arm to the tits.

1255
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,270
He's got a,

1256
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,110
you showing it,

1257
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,970
pull it up on the screen
so we can see it too.

1258
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,250
This dude is armed to the tits.

1259
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,700
He's got bulletproof everything on.

1260
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,820
They got a van stuffed with bullets and
Ammo and rifles and shit and he's just

1261
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:56,990
fucking cops up.

1262
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,160
This is a different guy,

1263
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:01,551
Brian,

1264
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:02,384
isn't it?

1265
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,600
The North Hollywood
shootout is what you want.

1266
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:06,111
Is this it?

1267
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:06,301
Yeah.

1268
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:07,270
It says North Hollywood shit.

1269
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,390
Oh this is the end.

1270
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:08,810
There's,

1271
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:09,950
that's where they just shot him.

1272
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,520
This is the end when there was some there
some videos before of him like fully

1273
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:20,951
armed up giant machine guns and shit
shooting at cops and the cops had pistols.

1274
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,850
Bullets are bouncing off of him.

1275
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,330
Yeah.

1276
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,430
I mean the cops had like standard,

1277
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,091
you know,

1278
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:31,010
officer issue pistols and this fucking
guy had like the craziest rifles.

1279
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:35,930
Money can buy machine guns and shit and
just these two dudes have all these cops

1280
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:36,764
at bay.

1281
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,560
This is the same one where
they were trying to rob a bank,

1282
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:40,010
right?

1283
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:40,491
That's that one.

1284
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:40,700
Yeah.

1285
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,533
Yup.

1286
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,553
Yeah.

1287
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,570
But see if it was a for cops,

1288
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,673
then what?

1289
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,860
Those guys do that again next week and
they do it again the week after and then

1290
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:49,580
who stops him?

1291
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,413
Who stops him?

1292
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:50,780
Yeah.

1293
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,390
We would not be able to
start to go in house to have,

1294
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,811
I'd like,

1295
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:56,270
I have an iPhone I can
throw at you or do you do?

1296
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,210
If someone's that crazy that they're
willing to do something like that,

1297
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,370
who knows where that guy's limits are?

1298
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,240
That guy could easily just go door to
door and gun people down and how many

1299
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:06,074
funny recess.

1300
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,710
Yeah.

1301
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,251
That are willing.

1302
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:08,900
Imagine if it was a hundred of those guys.

1303
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,470
Yes,

1304
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:09,921
exactly.

1305
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:10,670
Out in the street.

1306
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,503
Exactly.

1307
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,950
That's what you've got
to really worry about.

1308
00:35:12,951 --> 00:35:16,520
We got really worried about is people
that don't think you need a military or

1309
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:18,110
don't think you need law enforcement.

1310
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,640
You're really kind of underestimating the
evil that human beings are capable of.

1311
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:26,540
We've just been in a nice place here
in America for a few hundred years.

1312
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:27,681
Pretty sweet.

1313
00:35:27,681 --> 00:35:29,180
As far as world history goes,

1314
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,010
like it's invading violence.

1315
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,911
Pretty sweet.

1316
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:33,440
Like one of the best spots ever.

1317
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,130
Like a solid 200 plus
years have nobody coming

1318
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,400
over here and fucking us up
like a few little baby attacks,

1319
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,060
but nothing in comparison to anything
that any other empire had to go through

1320
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,210
over like you know the course of its,

1321
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,640
it's rain now.

1322
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,330
If you think about how
many like human beings,

1323
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,930
how many different countries they are
in this country and then that we have

1324
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:58,260
military bases and like a
hundred plus of those countries.

1325
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,500
You know those numbers are crazy.

1326
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:04,980
That's just stopping and thinking
about how many of us there are is nuts,

1327
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,800
but if there wasn't a military and so
crazy fucks like those north Hollywood

1328
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:14,280
guys gathered up together and
decided to start taking shit over,

1329
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,420
what would you do?

1330
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,040
People are capable of that.

1331
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:17,820
That's,

1332
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,350
it's a very unfortunate,

1333
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:23,250
but it's a realistic aspect
I could to realistic subject.

1334
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,540
It needs to be breached.

1335
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,120
It's very unfortunate that people
are capable of things like that,

1336
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:32,121
but they are and to not plan on it and
to not be prepared in case it happens.

1337
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,060
There's a lot of civilizations that
don't exist anymore because of that.

1338
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:37,281
Yeah.

1339
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:37,610
You,

1340
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,470
you get used to the safety you have.

1341
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,020
Then you go to like you know,

1342
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,620
a third world country and you're like,

1343
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:42,831
oh,

1344
00:36:42,831 --> 00:36:44,390
things aren't as together over there.

1345
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,140
And there's like groups of people who are
fighting other groups within like that

1346
00:36:48,141 --> 00:36:52,250
could never happen here unless they
got on the phone going at each other

1347
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,500
unless they got over here.

1348
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,270
See anything can happen here.

1349
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:56,260
Once it happens here,

1350
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:56,820
you know,

1351
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,211
how,

1352
00:36:57,211 --> 00:36:57,390
how,

1353
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,680
how quickly would they be
able to tighten it down?

1354
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,221
I don't know.

1355
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:01,090
I would hope quickly,

1356
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,380
I would hope quickly.

1357
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,310
But like when,

1358
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,620
when people look at things like

1359
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:07,781
when you,

1360
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:11,410
when you look at things
like the bad aspects of,

1361
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:12,244
um,

1362
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:17,380
of the military or the bad aspects
of war and the bad aspects of police

1363
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:18,011
enforcement,

1364
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:18,850
law enforcement,

1365
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,080
the bad aspects of,

1366
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,381
you know,

1367
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:25,381
people being horrible and police
brutality in those situations.

1368
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,370
I think we,

1369
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:32,530
people are tending to go in only
one direction with the idea.

1370
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,920
Like they're only looking at the
violence that these cops are doing to

1371
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:36,670
civilians.

1372
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,900
The not looking at like,

1373
00:37:37,901 --> 00:37:39,940
what are we asking these people to do?

1374
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,800
What are we asking these normal people
to do for $40,000 a year and how much of

1375
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:48,970
an assurance do we have that these people
are of sound character or they can get

1376
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:49,930
through that Gig.

1377
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:50,411
Yeah.

1378
00:37:50,411 --> 00:37:52,150
I know there's some screening processes,

1379
00:37:52,151 --> 00:37:56,830
but how thorough is it really and how
much do we really know about the impact of

1380
00:37:56,831 --> 00:37:58,000
day to day violence,

1381
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:00,460
day to day bullshit that these
people have to deal with?

1382
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,200
It sounds like the craziest job ever.

1383
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,330
Imagine if you had to be a vice cop.

1384
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,260
No,

1385
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,640
but I would think that I
would want that go pro on me.

1386
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,460
I had all the time,

1387
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:08,900
so yeah.

1388
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,201
Yeah,

1389
00:38:09,201 --> 00:38:10,034
I think that would,

1390
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,190
I think that's the most important
thing for cops nowadays.

1391
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:14,110
I think they need that,

1392
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,630
I think.

1393
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:19,400
I think that would be a perfect way to
police the police and have helped the

1394
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:20,660
cops at the same time.

1395
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,030
Imagine starting in a bad neighborhood to,

1396
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:24,440
I'd want to start in the suburbs.

1397
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,900
I want to go to watts.

1398
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:27,261
I'm like,

1399
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:31,070
just let me do a couple of traffic stops
before I'm like involved in a shootout.

1400
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,740
Right.

1401
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,120
There was a guy that I
used to do taekwondo with.

1402
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,010
He got

1403
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,880
reassigned.

1404
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,510
He wanted to get reassigned
to a more urban area and I go,

1405
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:41,490
why do you want to do that?

1406
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,670
It's like there's more action.

1407
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:43,931
I was like,

1408
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:45,040
more action.

1409
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,970
Wow,

1410
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,480
whoa.

1411
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,540
I would want to start off like small
town like where there's two cops for the

1412
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:50,410
whole city,

1413
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:50,830
you know?

1414
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,221
Yeah.

1415
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:51,460
No,

1416
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,090
this dude,

1417
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,040
this dude wanted to be with
the shit was going down.

1418
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,140
He genuinely enjoyed it.

1419
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,371
He,

1420
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:57,721
there was a,

1421
00:38:57,721 --> 00:38:58,150
he's a,

1422
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,260
he's an odd duck.

1423
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,520
He was like a,

1424
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:07,020
it's weird sorta hard ass cop guy who uh,

1425
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,410
who liked to fight,

1426
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,580
but he was really nice guy.

1427
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:10,271
Like as a cop.

1428
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:11,104
He's really nice.

1429
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,130
Did they have like a
good sense for justice?

1430
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:14,470
He wasn't like a power guy.

1431
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,130
He was,

1432
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:15,963
it was weird.

1433
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,230
He was a sweet guy,

1434
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:21,400
but it seemed like he would like look
forward to someone doing something that he

1435
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,240
could correct him on.

1436
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,321
You know,

1437
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:24,370
like if you didn't,

1438
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:25,930
if you didn't do anything wrong,

1439
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:27,160
he was like a super nice guy.

1440
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:30,100
But it was weird being friends with
this dude while it was like a young

1441
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:30,641
teenager.

1442
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:31,900
Cause I always like thought of cops.

1443
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:32,111
It's like,

1444
00:39:32,111 --> 00:39:32,471
Oh shit,

1445
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,304
I'm gonna get arrested.

1446
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,060
You know,

1447
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,490
think of all the people that I
knew that were dirt bags like,

1448
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:36,821
ah,

1449
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:37,601
I gotta get Outta here.

1450
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:38,434
There's a cop,

1451
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:38,801
you know?

1452
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:40,120
But he was,

1453
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:40,954
um,

1454
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,070
he was older than me,

1455
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,580
but it was,

1456
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,960
it was a weird sort of
a relationship because,

1457
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:47,410
um,

1458
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,101
he was older than me,

1459
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:49,600
but I was better at martial arts in him.

1460
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,040
So I beat his ass.

1461
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,770
But he was a cop and then he'd arrest you.

1462
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,690
Well you didn't arrest me,

1463
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,050
but you know,

1464
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:57,700
I would like,

1465
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,690
I would even take it easy on them
sometime in sparring because it was a cop

1466
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,370
because I would just think like,

1467
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,610
I do not want this dude
like developing a grudge,

1468
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:07,310
you know?

1469
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,143
Yeah.

1470
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,820
Cause people could develop a grudge,

1471
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,953
you know?

1472
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,010
And especially like the
Ma like sparring sessions,

1473
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,460
there's,

1474
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,370
there's like sparring sessions for
striking and then sparring sessions for

1475
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:21,310
grappling sparring sessions
for grappling are way safer.

1476
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,570
So you can go really,

1477
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:23,890
really go at it hard,

1478
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,300
but sparring sessions for,

1479
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,350
for striking,

1480
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,530
they're really dangerous because if
people get knocked out all the time,

1481
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:32,770
so this is like a certain
amount of respect that you
have to give each other and

1482
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:34,210
you have to not hit each other that hard.

1483
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,040
And some guys just don't play by that.

1484
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:36,874
Some guys would just,

1485
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,950
it all goes out the window and
start winging shots at you.

1486
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:39,551
And next thing you know,

1487
00:40:39,551 --> 00:40:40,660
you're in a melee.

1488
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,550
Like it happens all the time.

1489
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,930
We're a sparring session,

1490
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:45,280
turns into an all out fight.

1491
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,450
It happens all the time.

1492
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,460
So he don't want to do that with a cop,

1493
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:49,643
you know?

1494
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,420
And it's especially a cop
that it knows how to fight.

1495
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:54,970
Pretty good to see the John Jones thing.

1496
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,211
Yeah,

1497
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:55,801
it was crazy,

1498
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:56,634
man.

1499
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,580
Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier had gotten
this huge scrap at a press conference.

1500
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,663
It was Rick Delaws,

1501
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,591
John Jones,

1502
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:02,740
uh,

1503
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,120
gotten dangle crummy aids face,

1504
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,120
put his forehead on
Daniel Cormier forehead.

1505
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,160
Daniel called me,

1506
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,690
had grabbed John Jones by the neck and
pushed him away and John dropped his

1507
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:11,111
belt.

1508
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:13,780
And then it was just bodies colliding.

1509
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,860
Wow.

1510
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,330
And John,

1511
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,280
immediately I cast,

1512
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:18,701
you know,

1513
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:18,971
there's a,

1514
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:20,170
it's a wild scramble,

1515
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,870
but John was on top and John was like,

1516
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:23,980
I took you down so quick.

1517
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,870
Within seven seconds
you were on your back.

1518
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:26,380
And they're like,

1519
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,041
oh no.

1520
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:28,000
Like the shit talking,

1521
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:30,640
just escalate it to a
totally different level.

1522
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,290
And John Jones put out a video that said,

1523
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:33,710
uh,

1524
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,041
you,

1525
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:34,671
you suck.

1526
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:35,630
You're so weak.

1527
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,880
When I got ahold of you felt so weak.

1528
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:38,991
Like it's really,

1529
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:40,400
and then he deleted the video,

1530
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,720
which is really interesting.

1531
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:41,861
See,

1532
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:42,694
this is what happened.

1533
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:44,710
Uh,

1534
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,620
poor guy in the middle.

1535
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,101
Yeah.

1536
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:47,190
That guy there.

1537
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,620
This is just a collide.

1538
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,370
Oh my God.

1539
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,720
Pile of bodies.

1540
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,860
Dan is on vacation.

1541
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:52,694
He wasn't even there.

1542
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,310
Yeah.

1543
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,330
This can't happen.

1544
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,470
I can't do that.

1545
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,540
This is real bad for the sport.

1546
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,770
It's real bad.

1547
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:03,050
It's real bad for public perception.

1548
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,531
It's a,

1549
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:06,080
a weapon to be used against MMA.

1550
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,873
You know,

1551
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,990
it's unfortunate,

1552
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,080
which you've got to have
everybody should have is uh,

1553
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,180
a no contact policy
unless guys agree to hug,

1554
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,471
you know,

1555
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,800
you agree to shake hands and hug.

1556
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,450
You should have a no contact policy and
anybody clearly violates that no contact

1557
00:42:23,451 --> 00:42:24,560
policy gets fined.

1558
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,610
You know that some guys can deal with
it that getting in each other's face.

1559
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:30,200
But when you have a situation like this,

1560
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,030
you know,

1561
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,400
you got to have to have a no
contact policy with those guys.

1562
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,361
The weigh ins,

1563
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:38,270
they're always doing the foreheads stuff
and I get it in people's face that's

1564
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:39,104
like know man.

1565
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,730
I think it's ridiculous.

1566
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,511
It's ridiculous.

1567
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:42,830
And some of it's gamesmanship,

1568
00:42:42,831 --> 00:42:44,870
but it's just so bad for
the image of the sport.

1569
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,610
Is that starting to happen more often?

1570
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,060
No,

1571
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,893
it's pretty rare.

1572
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,441
It's pretty rare.

1573
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,150
But that's a big high profile fight.

1574
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,420
I mean like Rhonda Rousey and me should,

1575
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,350
they got head to head and each
of those phases and it was,

1576
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,393
it was pretty hot,

1577
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,053
I saw were there.

1578
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:01,603
But um,

1579
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,230
they were professional about it.

1580
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,340
They didn't do anything about it.

1581
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:05,780
These guys were not professional.

1582
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,040
Like it was like immediate.

1583
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:08,091
Yeah,

1584
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:09,080
you can't do that.

1585
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,183
You know,

1586
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,800
he can't grab each other and fucking slap,

1587
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,251
you know?

1588
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:13,911
And if you say,

1589
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:14,271
Hey,

1590
00:43:14,271 --> 00:43:15,590
I don't want to head but you man,

1591
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,071
you know,

1592
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:16,430
or,

1593
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,050
but nobody wants to give ground,

1594
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,220
you know,

1595
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,053
they just,

1596
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,291
they don't,

1597
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:21,531
you know,

1598
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:24,720
they don't want anybody getting any
psychological advantage and so they're

1599
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:25,100
there.

1600
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,110
They have to show each
other like they'll fuck,

1601
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,250
I'll fucking fight you right here.

1602
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,773
And then you know,

1603
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,310
that's when shit like this happens.

1604
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,930
It's like they just have to treat it.

1605
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:33,920
You got,

1606
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,580
this is a,

1607
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,360
like the importance of that
not happening is huge to huge.

1608
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,243
There's a,

1609
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:43,940
it's just such a negative
connotation attached to what that is.

1610
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,350
That's just violence.

1611
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,820
The difference between that
kind of violence and the
violence of a sport is the

1612
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:53,990
violence of a sport is everyone's
agreeing to this scenario.

1613
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,450
You're agreeing to train
for x amount of weeks.

1614
00:43:56,451 --> 00:43:58,250
You're going to fight
for x amount of rounds.

1615
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,360
You're going to fight this guy.

1616
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:00,410
He weighs what you weigh.

1617
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:01,280
Everybody prepares,

1618
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:03,050
you meet at this day and you compete.

1619
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,330
And it's a very dangerous
form of competition.

1620
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:05,691
And yes,

1621
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:07,430
it is fighting as a competition,

1622
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,580
but it's not violence the
same way that that is.

1623
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,080
That's a street fight.

1624
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:12,740
That's okay.

1625
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,330
That's a world champion.

1626
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:19,040
Mixed martial arts fighter and an Olympic
wrestler and there's street fighting.

1627
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,480
That's bad for everybody.

1628
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:21,770
That's bad for wrestling.

1629
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:23,060
That's bad for MMA.

1630
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:24,470
That's bad for sports.

1631
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,450
It's fun for people to watch,

1632
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:27,230
you know.

1633
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,063
Oh yeah,

1634
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:28,430
you know,

1635
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,001
was part of me.

1636
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:29,510
I have two,

1637
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,500
two ways of looking at it.

1638
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,700
Part of is like that's bad for the sport,

1639
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:35,070
but pardon me is like how
do I feel about it though?

1640
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,330
Does it bum me out?

1641
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,040
No,

1642
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,431
no.

1643
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:39,510
It doesn't make me upset.

1644
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:40,410
I'm not upset.

1645
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,840
I'm looking forward to watching
this fight even more now.

1646
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:43,441
Look,

1647
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:43,771
I would,

1648
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:45,450
I have liked it to non happen.

1649
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,470
Absolutely.

1650
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,071
Absolutely.

1651
00:44:47,071 --> 00:44:48,800
I wish that they were very
professional about this.

1652
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:49,750
They don't need to do that.

1653
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:51,630
That fight is going to be
amazing no matter what happens.

1654
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,830
But since it did happen
and I got to see it,

1655
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:55,081
I'm like,

1656
00:44:55,081 --> 00:44:55,980
Whoa,

1657
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,840
I'm not going to pretend
that that's not fun.

1658
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:58,341
You know,

1659
00:44:58,341 --> 00:45:01,890
I'm not going to pretend that that didn't
make everybody way more excited about

1660
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:04,110
that fight cause it fucking for sure did.

1661
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:04,681
Yeah,

1662
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:05,490
it's not good.

1663
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,510
It's not good to do,

1664
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,520
but it was fun to watch and more people
are going to be excited about the fight.

1665
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:12,661
I mean there's,

1666
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:14,080
that's the catch 22 that's,

1667
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,100
there's no real black or white about this,

1668
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:17,581
you know,

1669
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,560
as a representative of the sport.

1670
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,710
I absolutely wish it didn't happen as a,

1671
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:25,830
a person who cares a lot about the
future of the sport and the public's

1672
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:26,431
perception,

1673
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:28,770
which I think is already a little skewed.

1674
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:32,730
I think there's a lot of
people that aren't fans that
like to look at the people

1675
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:33,450
that fight in him MMA.

1676
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:34,530
It's just barbarians.

1677
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:35,250
But there's a,

1678
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,430
there was a lot of Nice guys that fight
in the UFC and there are some of the

1679
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,110
nicest athletes you'll ever meet.

1680
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,213
That's a fact.

1681
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,240
So pardon me.

1682
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,910
He gets bummed out when
I see shit like that,

1683
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:46,410
but part of me is like,

1684
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:46,621
look,

1685
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:48,690
they're going to fight eventually anyway.

1686
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,110
A little here.

1687
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:52,710
Being passionate,

1688
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:53,544
a little taste,

1689
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:55,230
get a little taste.

1690
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,030
I Dunno.

1691
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,530
It's going to be a wild ass fight though.

1692
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,393
When is that fight?

1693
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,600
That's a good question.

1694
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:00,883
Um,

1695
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:01,933
it's uh,

1696
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,430
I think it's September 27th in Vegas.

1697
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,640
Is that it or is the weekend of the 27th,

1698
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:08,990
uh,

1699
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:11,150
either way it's on like donkey Kong.

1700
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:12,383
No,

1701
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:13,790
it's going to be exciting,

1702
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,310
but it's unfortunate man.

1703
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:17,850
It's unfortunate.

1704
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,800
So as far as now they
didn't get in any trouble.

1705
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:20,310
I Dunno.

1706
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,750
I mean is on vacation.

1707
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,800
I mean I read that that there is that
they were going to get in trouble.

1708
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,830
There's some thing in that contract,

1709
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:30,480
you know that you can't do that shit.

1710
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:31,383
No

1711
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,920
thing that says there'll be consequences.

1712
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,503
That's the statement.

1713
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,620
The official statement.

1714
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,270
There will be consequences.

1715
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:41,930
It's almost scary or that was,

1716
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:44,121
yeah,

1717
00:46:44,121 --> 00:46:45,000
that sounds very little.

1718
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,010
Contact you.

1719
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:46,881
It's very vampire.

1720
00:46:46,881 --> 00:46:50,110
Like it'd be consequences to actions.

1721
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,640
You don't get any of the headphones
to wear during the fights.

1722
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:53,870
Have you been watching the strain?

1723
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,700
You've been watching the strain

1724
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,060
del Toro show on Fx.

1725
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,500
It's fucking great man.

1726
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,890
It's great.

1727
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:02,110
I'm just waiting now.

1728
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,940
But wait until these five or six there.

1729
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:04,271
Yeah,

1730
00:47:04,271 --> 00:47:05,470
there's four out now.

1731
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,810
This is the fourth one
just aired on Sunday.

1732
00:47:07,811 --> 00:47:08,760
It's fucking fun.

1733
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,050
Cause the billboard with
the thing going into the,

1734
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,920
I was like,

1735
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,430
I'm in,

1736
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:13,450
I don't even know what this says,

1737
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:15,190
but I'm absolutely doing this.

1738
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,370
I read the

1739
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,800
book and I don't remember
the worms from the book.

1740
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:19,850
Maybe I just don't remember.

1741
00:47:19,851 --> 00:47:22,340
Maybe I have to go back and read it again.

1742
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,450
I didn't remember that part.

1743
00:47:23,451 --> 00:47:25,940
But I remember the book being really
entertaining for like three quarters away

1744
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,670
through like really fun
in the beginning too.

1745
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:29,591
It's a story.

1746
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:29,771
It's a,

1747
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:33,010
it's an interesting story and
they don't a great job at the,

1748
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:33,161
uh,

1749
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:33,941
the miniseries.

1750
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:35,050
It's really good man.

1751
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,320
It's like really ropes you in.

1752
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:37,154
It's fun.

1753
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:38,020
And he tried.

1754
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,580
I just gave up on the leftovers.

1755
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:44,050
I love horror movies and shows
like we need more of that shit.

1756
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:45,010
Like more,

1757
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,480
more Zombie Shit.

1758
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,550
More uh,

1759
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:48,041
you know,

1760
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:49,240
more vampire shit.

1761
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,103
It's fun.

1762
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,051
Harm or harm.

1763
00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:53,230
Movies have taken a big dive.

1764
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,690
I don't know if you go
back to like the 1950s,

1765
00:47:55,691 --> 00:47:59,080
look at those black and white movies at
which super popular back then there was

1766
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:00,370
so many horror movies,

1767
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:01,263
man,

1768
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,490
the creature from the black lagoon,

1769
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:04,683
remember those.

1770
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,240
But now I like now there the demand is
so much more for like there to be a real

1771
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:09,991
story and said,

1772
00:48:09,991 --> 00:48:14,130
I like this monster attacks avail and
then a hot girl gets her clothes ripped

1773
00:48:14,131 --> 00:48:15,120
off and you see your tits.

1774
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:15,330
You're like,

1775
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:17,430
that was an amazing dude.

1776
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:22,431
We should do a mystery science theater
type thing where we watched creature from

1777
00:48:22,561 --> 00:48:23,394
the black of good.

1778
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,481
It is.

1779
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:25,440
So first of all,

1780
00:48:25,441 --> 00:48:27,150
it's so obvious during a swimming pool.

1781
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,900
He's not a fucking lagoon at all.

1782
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,240
It was like some back lot swimming pool.

1783
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,460
They put cement there.

1784
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:35,723
That's weird.

1785
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:36,940
The fucking,

1786
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,300
the creature was pretty dope for the time.

1787
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,050
It was like just a really
cool scuba diving outfit.

1788
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:43,943
Essentially.

1789
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,333
This,

1790
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,170
this weird freaky lizard
like scuba diving outfit.

1791
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,110
They put this,

1792
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:53,640
this guy in and he would swim in the
swimming pool at capture that girl.

1793
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,400
It's so bad.

1794
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:58,560
It's so bad that it's awesome.

1795
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:00,120
Like it's so bad.

1796
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:01,800
It's exciting when you watch it.

1797
00:49:01,801 --> 00:49:02,634
Here it is

1798
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:08,290
out of the mom and this
300 million years ago,

1799
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:13,200
depths,

1800
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,200
Avanti known water comes up creature
to confound science and terrorize the

1801
00:49:22,581 --> 00:49:23,414
world.

1802
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,790
This is awesome.

1803
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,350
This is awesome.

1804
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,230
Grab this guy by the head.

1805
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:38,590
It was the worst acting
job anybody's ever done.

1806
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:39,483
Ever.

1807
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,330
Look at this.

1808
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,170
Shocking

1809
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,910
perfected three dimension.

1810
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,140
Ou was three d.

1811
00:49:46,141 --> 00:49:47,610
I didn't even know it was three days.

1812
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:51,270
It was one of those where you got your
glasses in the Sunday paper and they

1813
00:49:51,271 --> 00:49:52,440
would play it on the TV.

1814
00:49:52,441 --> 00:49:53,100
Remember that?

1815
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:53,401
Wow.

1816
00:49:53,401 --> 00:49:53,940
No,

1817
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,631
that's cool.

1818
00:49:54,631 --> 00:49:54,730
You'll

1819
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:55,390
find out.

1820
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:56,560
I do remember that.

1821
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,000
The bridge between
vision from the land down

1822
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:02,270
changed in many of you

1823
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:04,933
here.

1824
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,840
Even the music here we
have a clue to an answer.

1825
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:09,933
Richard Cow.

1826
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,410
Remley.

1827
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,380
I'm venturing underwater
in the camp of Mit.

1828
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,343
I'm on

1829
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,960
lovely Julia or beauty,

1830
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:18,420
a law man,

1831
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:19,540
a dawn of time.

1832
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,260
Fucking penny.

1833
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,123
Who was tying that?

1834
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,140
I couldn't burn to them.

1835
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,550
The most amazing under one
roof brain has ever known.

1836
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,020
Wow.

1837
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:34,670
This is incredible.

1838
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:35,800
I look at it,

1839
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,740
that's so obvious.

1840
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:37,610
It's a pool.

1841
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:40,850
This is not a ripple in that water.

1842
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,310
Look at it for men dead so far.

1843
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,230
Staying until we get or until
somebody else gets killed

1844
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:55,930
is dives in the water with her

1845
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,100
deep,

1846
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,640
deep,

1847
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,473
deep,

1848
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,220
and do the waters of his domain.

1849
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,240
This is hilarious.

1850
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:05,470
He's just going to drown this chick.

1851
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:06,700
I know she wasn't dead already.

1852
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,391
What's he doing?

1853
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,250
Is he making out with her?

1854
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:13,310
Does she keep her from drowning Rick
cave or does she have a scuba outfit?

1855
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,100
Amazing.

1856
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,510
In three dimension,

1857
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:20,260
quick job from the black lagoon.

1858
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,440
They should do it and remake it.

1859
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:22,161
This one guy,

1860
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:23,990
just some monster and a creek.

1861
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,730
Scratch all these rapes and then,

1862
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:26,181
yeah,

1863
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:27,470
you could come up with a better story.

1864
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:27,771
Right?

1865
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:28,231
You just say,

1866
00:51:28,231 --> 00:51:29,990
it was like some genetic experiment that,

1867
00:51:29,991 --> 00:51:30,101
oh,

1868
00:51:30,101 --> 00:51:34,790
it's taped some dude who's really
rich and Florida from cocaine.

1869
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,500
He hired a bunch of scientists,

1870
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,190
right.

1871
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,720
To try to make lizard soldiers.

1872
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:39,981
Right.

1873
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:40,190
This,

1874
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:41,600
that could totally be a story.

1875
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:45,290
They could do that creature from
the black and to be in Miami,

1876
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,100
fucking people up in Miami because
you need the hot girls to kill.

1877
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:49,650
Yeah.

1878
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:50,810
We're always swimming around.

1879
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:51,351
Well,

1880
00:51:51,351 --> 00:51:51,530
you'll,

1881
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:53,210
it needs at least them to run.

1882
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:54,980
You don't have to kill him.

1883
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,873
Yeah.

1884
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,620
Very slow motion if they're
run titties or balancing,

1885
00:51:59,621 --> 00:52:01,040
whether being chased by a lizard man.

1886
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:05,040
That's what you could count on with all
those Jason Movies where you're like in

1887
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:09,030
the first scene he's going to be walking
through some camp and there's going to

1888
00:52:09,031 --> 00:52:12,750
be a bunch of girls going like nothing's
going to happen cause she's take off

1889
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:13,441
clothes.

1890
00:52:13,441 --> 00:52:14,420
It's very hot.

1891
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:17,880
Yeah,

1892
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,740
let's make out for warmth.

1893
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:20,031
Yeah,

1894
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:20,660
that does.

1895
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,190
Shondra is kind of,

1896
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,660
that genre is kind of gone away a bit.

1897
00:52:26,661 --> 00:52:27,260
Right.

1898
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,093
It,

1899
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,840
I mean those were big movies.

1900
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,380
Oh I know.

1901
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,340
Halloween,

1902
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,830
Friday the 13th all those movies.

1903
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:35,030
Those are big movies man.

1904
00:52:35,031 --> 00:52:37,580
Like you get fired up
Friday 30th Freddy Krueger.

1905
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,570
Even when they were bad,

1906
00:52:38,571 --> 00:52:39,130
they were good.

1907
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:39,963
Yeah.

1908
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:40,940
There was,

1909
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:45,130
if you could ensure that a couple of girls
would be having a pillow fight and it

1910
00:52:45,131 --> 00:52:47,660
tit would pop out and
the ax murderer shows up.

1911
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:48,543
Yeah.

1912
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,660
You're talking about that for two months
with your friends if you're a teenager.

1913
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:52,280
Yeah.

1914
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,840
Especially if it's like Jason Cause he's,

1915
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,430
he's on dead or whatever it is.

1916
00:52:55,431 --> 00:52:56,420
Nobody knows what he is.

1917
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:57,051
Yeah.

1918
00:52:57,051 --> 00:53:00,320
He was killed and then came back
so they fucking run them over.

1919
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:01,154
They shoot him,

1920
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,950
rises and somehow or another
finds a way to get you

1921
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,310
and it didn't even matter back.

1922
00:53:05,311 --> 00:53:05,451
Then.

1923
00:53:05,451 --> 00:53:05,701
They're like,

1924
00:53:05,701 --> 00:53:05,911
well,

1925
00:53:05,911 --> 00:53:08,970
we have to explain to the
viewers how he came back to like,

1926
00:53:08,971 --> 00:53:12,870
well that's what does like four pairs
of tits or for immediately there forget.

1927
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,750
Then it just goes on a
rampage for two hours.

1928
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,460
It was a different world back then.

1929
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,290
Scream movies were good.

1930
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:20,370
I thought the scream.

1931
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,240
Yeah,

1932
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,073
those were good.

1933
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,010
Those are fun.

1934
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,120
It took a lot from those,

1935
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:26,280
that old school of horror slasher

1936
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,113
film thing.

1937
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,390
What bums me out is the
lack of monster movies.

1938
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,530
That's a bums me out.

1939
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:33,300
Like whenever a good
monster movie comes out,

1940
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:34,590
I get like super excited.

1941
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:34,961
I,

1942
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:35,850
this is going to be fun,

1943
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,500
but there's so few.

1944
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,670
So few like Godzilla is our right,

1945
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,091
you know,

1946
00:53:42,091 --> 00:53:42,924
it was fun.

1947
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,230
It was.

1948
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:44,550
It was really well done.

1949
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:46,320
Like the gods ill itself is amazing,

1950
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,230
but there,

1951
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,930
this is just one motherfucker.

1952
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,170
The main dude who
survives more close calls,

1953
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:55,980
this goddamn movie than anybody
in the history of monster movies.

1954
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:56,431
I mean,

1955
00:53:56,431 --> 00:53:57,410
it's so ridiculous.

1956
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:58,620
Like everywhere he is,

1957
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:01,530
everybody dies and he
escapes and everybody dies
and he escapes and everybody

1958
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:01,860
does it.

1959
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,611
He's like,

1960
00:54:02,611 --> 00:54:03,540
fuck man.

1961
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:05,610
You know that by the
time the movie's over,

1962
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:06,600
by the end of the movie,

1963
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:09,570
like you used up all your
get out of jail free cards,

1964
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:09,870
dude,

1965
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:10,650
like yeah,

1966
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,030
you just officially ridiculous.

1967
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:14,440
Like he's the guy that
lands in between the pause,

1968
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,870
the tail slams,

1969
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:19,261
and it's like,

1970
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:19,951
Oh God,

1971
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:20,910
I was like four feet away.

1972
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,540
Thank God.

1973
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,620
Exactly.

1974
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,050
I mean it's just,

1975
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,010
there's so many cut the shit scenes,

1976
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,550
but what they can do now as
far as the special effects,

1977
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,601
it makes it worth,

1978
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:34,320
it makes it worth seeing because
even if the story is goofy as Shit,

1979
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,020
the monsters are insane.

1980
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:37,451
Like,

1981
00:54:37,451 --> 00:54:37,550
good,

1982
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:37,961
wait God,

1983
00:54:37,961 --> 00:54:39,120
Zillow looks now.

1984
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:41,710
Holy Fuck didn't did you.

1985
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:42,910
You watched it and didn't like it.

1986
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:43,440
It was that you,

1987
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,040
I never saw it.

1988
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:44,671
Or Ari,

1989
00:54:44,671 --> 00:54:45,391
Ari was like,

1990
00:54:45,391 --> 00:54:45,840
yeah,

1991
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,680
he hated it.

1992
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:47,281
Of course he did.

1993
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:47,530
He's like,

1994
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:47,850
ah,

1995
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:48,151
totally.

1996
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,200
Don't watch that movie ever,

1997
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:49,921
like what's wrong?

1998
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:52,020
And he just had all these
problems with the storyline.

1999
00:54:52,021 --> 00:54:52,351
I'm like,

2000
00:54:52,351 --> 00:54:53,160
Ra,

2001
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:58,160
it's a giant lizard destroying
Japan or whatever it might be.

2002
00:54:58,891 --> 00:54:59,710
A God.

2003
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:00,420
Yeah.

2004
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,081
They always do that.

2005
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:02,570
And he's movies in my pit.

2006
00:55:02,571 --> 00:55:04,110
God dumped them.

2007
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,233
Yeah,

2008
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,870
they might be gods.

2009
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,710
What was the one with the giant
robot warrior ones that came out?

2010
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:11,041
Oh,

2011
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:11,880
transformers.

2012
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:12,211
No,

2013
00:55:12,211 --> 00:55:12,391
no,

2014
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:13,260
it was um,

2015
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:14,343
oh,

2016
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:16,540
I liked that one.

2017
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:19,940
She really giant robots going at it.

2018
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,870
It was like watching a video game.

2019
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,400
It was cool.

2020
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,241
That part was cool.

2021
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:24,551
But the,

2022
00:55:24,551 --> 00:55:24,940
the uh,

2023
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,160
the,

2024
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:30,160
the human parts were portable and it
really felt like I was watching someone

2025
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:35,391
like took a comic book and just didn't
do any rewrites it all and just slapped

2026
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:36,810
it together.

2027
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:37,980
It was very comic book live,

2028
00:55:37,981 --> 00:55:38,371
which is,

2029
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:39,030
you know,

2030
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,710
I think in some cases is fine,

2031
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,060
but the comic books that they're doing,

2032
00:55:42,061 --> 00:55:43,050
not comic book movies,

2033
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:44,130
they do so well.

2034
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,020
Like captain America,

2035
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:46,951
you know,

2036
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:47,970
it's silly story,

2037
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,290
but it's a good,

2038
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,940
they do a really good job.

2039
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,770
Like they make these
movies are fun to watch.

2040
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:53,850
They do a great job.

2041
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:59,040
So like if you go back to like really
clunky sort of like stuff like that,

2042
00:55:59,041 --> 00:55:59,610
like the,

2043
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,600
the Pacific thing,

2044
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,011
it just,

2045
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:01,410
it's just,

2046
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:02,550
it was too clunky for me.

2047
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:03,623
Does that make sense?

2048
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,021
Yeah.

2049
00:56:04,021 --> 00:56:06,180
Store like storywise yeah.

2050
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:06,451
Yeah.

2051
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:07,284
That I didn't even,

2052
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:07,690
I was like,

2053
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:09,810
I want to go watch a movie
and turned my brain off.

2054
00:56:09,811 --> 00:56:10,141
And I'm like,

2055
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:11,130
what better thing to watch?

2056
00:56:11,131 --> 00:56:14,310
Like 200 foot tall robots
destroy each other.

2057
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,040
But there was a seam in this like guy
and a grower in love with each other or

2058
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:17,611
something.

2059
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:18,001
And I was like,

2060
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:19,170
what am I watching here?

2061
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:19,741
What kind of,

2062
00:56:19,741 --> 00:56:19,861
yeah.

2063
00:56:19,861 --> 00:56:20,520
That's where you're like,

2064
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:20,641
oh,

2065
00:56:20,641 --> 00:56:22,760
bathroom time or cigarette or something.

2066
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,490
What is this robot

2067
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:25,323
fight thing?

2068
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,253
What are you guys doing?

2069
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:26,861
What's happening here?

2070
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:27,694
Where's the monsters?

2071
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,030
Yeah,

2072
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:28,661
show me some monsters,

2073
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:29,494
bitch.

2074
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,270
I hated the acting.

2075
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:31,391
I,

2076
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:32,320
I was,

2077
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,520
I couldn't even watch it.

2078
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,121
Yeah,

2079
00:56:34,121 --> 00:56:34,931
but seems like they,

2080
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:36,580
it was a choice though.

2081
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,590
It seemed very comic book like right.

2082
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,453
Didn't it?

2083
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,280
Almost like they were
going for like a certain,

2084
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:43,383
a certain feel.

2085
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:43,751
Yeah.

2086
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:47,200
How did that like comic book
video game feel exactly like,

2087
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:48,700
I don't even remember who was in it.

2088
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,770
Not The human beings that were in it.

2089
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,221
Yeah.

2090
00:56:52,221 --> 00:56:54,800
I remember I got really mad when I finally
watched that movie because everyone

2091
00:56:54,801 --> 00:56:55,670
told me it was good.

2092
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,560
That fucking Tom Cruise movies.

2093
00:56:57,561 --> 00:56:58,370
Good.

2094
00:56:58,370 --> 00:56:59,450
The the latest one.

2095
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:00,620
Yeah,

2096
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:01,453
the edge of tomorrow.

2097
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:02,743
What's that one about?

2098
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:03,950
It's a science fiction movie.

2099
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:04,761
It's really good,

2100
00:57:04,761 --> 00:57:05,150
man.

2101
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:05,983
It's really good.

2102
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:10,310
I mean I said it's really good and a
bunch of people criticized me online.

2103
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:11,863
How dare you.

2104
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:14,690
But I think that those
people you to movie sucks.

2105
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:15,290
Listen man,

2106
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:16,520
it's just my taste.

2107
00:57:16,521 --> 00:57:16,971
Okay.

2108
00:57:16,971 --> 00:57:18,050
You can't say it sucks.

2109
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:18,830
I liked,

2110
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:19,760
we liked different things,

2111
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,041
but uh,

2112
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,120
I understand if you think
the movie sucks to you,

2113
00:57:23,121 --> 00:57:25,270
but to me I thought it was excellent it,

2114
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:26,810
and if it wasn't Tom Cruise,

2115
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:30,050
I think if it was some other dude
that didn't carry a lot of baggage,

2116
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,720
I think it'd probably been
braided a lot higher than it was.

2117
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,090
I think one of the reasons
why people are like,

2118
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:35,391
Oh,

2119
00:57:35,391 --> 00:57:36,260
the movie wasn't that good.

2120
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,690
I really think it's because
it's a Tom cruise movie.

2121
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,730
I think like Tom Cruise is moving movies.

2122
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:42,770
People think they're good,

2123
00:57:42,771 --> 00:57:43,401
they're pretty good.

2124
00:57:43,401 --> 00:57:44,234
That's pretty good.

2125
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:47,150
But if it was like another
actor in the same role,

2126
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:47,871
like they wouldn't,

2127
00:57:47,871 --> 00:57:49,610
it wouldn't be judged
the same way I think.

2128
00:57:49,611 --> 00:57:51,500
I think people just think
that guy is so wacky.

2129
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,011
Yeah.

2130
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:53,320
It's reputation proceeds.

2131
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,950
Anything else they can do from now on?

2132
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:55,461
He,

2133
00:57:55,461 --> 00:57:55,821
but he's,

2134
00:57:55,821 --> 00:57:56,690
he's so,

2135
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:58,423
so good.

2136
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,230
It's like he's really good actor.

2137
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,480
He's fucking really good in this movie.

2138
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:04,250
Like you buy it like a,

2139
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:05,330
I don't want to give away the plot,

2140
00:58:05,331 --> 00:58:05,801
but it's a,

2141
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:09,500
it's a pretty ridiculous
plot and he sells it.

2142
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,200
Like the idea behind it is
pretty crazy and he sells it.

2143
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:13,483
It people moving.

2144
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,420
People forget like there's a reason he
became the biggest movie star in the

2145
00:58:17,421 --> 00:58:18,230
world.

2146
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,890
Yeah.

2147
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:19,430
It's cute.

2148
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:20,263
It's got a cute face.

2149
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:20,840
Yeah.

2150
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,080
It's,

2151
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,010
he's talented.

2152
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:24,410
He's talented as fuck.

2153
00:58:24,411 --> 00:58:25,490
Just happens to be insane.

2154
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:26,443
Yeah.

2155
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:29,510
I think that everybody who's
really good at that Gig is insane.

2156
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:34,130
I think that's an insane person's
hobby or insane person's profession.

2157
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:34,730
Yeah,

2158
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:35,391
they're really good ones.

2159
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,310
I mean you can contain your insanity,

2160
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:38,953
but

2161
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:43,840
that's like the difficult trick it seems
for celebrities now is to not let it

2162
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:45,550
out crazy.

2163
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,381
Cause there's so many.

2164
00:58:46,381 --> 00:58:47,380
Then you could just like,

2165
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,520
oh I'm going to tweet something.

2166
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:49,354
And people were like,

2167
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:49,661
dude,

2168
00:58:49,661 --> 00:58:52,580
you know Sheil a buff is out of his mouth.

2169
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:55,840
Did you read all those tweets?

2170
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:56,621
And it was,

2171
00:58:56,621 --> 00:58:57,550
that's all been there.

2172
00:58:58,370 --> 00:58:59,260
We just didn't know.

2173
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,430
Like imagine if there were social
media and the fifties that did things.

2174
00:59:03,431 --> 00:59:06,620
Humphrey Bogart railing against.

2175
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:07,973
Yeah.

2176
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,580
Cary grant's like homophobic.

2177
00:59:09,581 --> 00:59:11,180
I didn't know all the,

2178
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,130
the racist shit that would be sad.

2179
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,770
All the Duis that would be publicized,

2180
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,190
the all the domestic and be like,

2181
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:20,290
who knows what those people
were in two back then.

2182
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,100
What is that guy's name

2183
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,960
from the early 19 hundreds?

2184
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:25,160
Fatty Arbuckle.

2185
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:25,400
Yeah.

2186
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,540
Remember that whole story?

2187
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,120
No Fatty Arbuckle apparently.

2188
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:29,750
Um,

2189
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:34,160
they put up a bottle or a glass up
a woman's vagina and it killed her.

2190
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:36,660
Whoa.

2191
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,320
Yeah.

2192
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:37,651
Yeah.

2193
00:59:37,651 --> 00:59:38,050
Something.

2194
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:38,440
Ha,

2195
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,273
let me,

2196
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,283
let me pull it up.

2197
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,393
Fatty.

2198
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:42,511
And he was,

2199
00:59:42,511 --> 00:59:43,020
uh,

2200
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,060
he was acquitted but
he never worked again.

2201
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,410
Wow.

2202
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:47,150
What's that James?

2203
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:47,850
Up on the screen.

2204
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:48,683
Right.

2205
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:50,250
Fatty Arbuckle.

2206
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:56,210
His name is Roscoe Roscoe Arbuckle.

2207
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,070
Yeah.

2208
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:58,903
Um,

2209
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,520
he uh,

2210
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,140
yeah,

2211
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,180
the woman died four days later.

2212
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,310
She fallen ill at a party and she died.

2213
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:12,923
Whoa.

2214
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:14,960
He was accused by,

2215
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:15,770
um,

2216
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:20,770
this woman's a acquaintance
of accidentally killing
the woman and after the

2217
01:00:21,471 --> 01:00:22,460
first two trials,

2218
01:00:22,461 --> 01:00:24,200
which resulted in hung juries,

2219
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:29,570
Arbuckle was acquitted in the third trial
and received a formal written apology

2220
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:30,404
from the jury.

2221
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,360
Despite Arbuckle's acquittal,

2222
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:34,850
the scandal has most overshadow,

2223
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,860
mostly overshadowed his legacy as a
pioneering comedian falling the trials,

2224
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,160
his films where banned and
he was publicly ostracized,

2225
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:46,100
although the ban and his films
was lifted within a year.

2226
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:49,070
Our buckle only works
sparingly through the 1920s.

2227
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:53,900
He later worked as a film director
under the alias William Goodrich.

2228
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,300
He was finally able to return to acting,

2229
01:00:56,301 --> 01:00:59,270
making two short real comedies
in 1932 for Warner brothers.

2230
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:02,840
He died and they sleep of a
heart attack at the age of 46.

2231
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:04,663
Whoa.

2232
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:06,620
Reportedly on the same day,

2233
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,900
sign a contract with Warner
brothers to make a feature film.

2234
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,131
That's scary.

2235
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:10,964
Shit.

2236
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:13,790
It doesn't say here what he did,

2237
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:17,390
like it doesn't get into
graphic detail about it.

2238
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,293
Okay.

2239
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:21,090
Just said she had fallen ill.

2240
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:23,453
I don't know.

2241
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:24,231
Yeah.

2242
01:01:24,231 --> 01:01:25,010
I wonder if they,

2243
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:26,690
how old is that story?

2244
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:27,651
Um,

2245
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:30,290
it's from 1921.

2246
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:31,570
Yeah,

2247
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:32,403
I guess I don't,

2248
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,580
I doubt they printed
stuff like that back then.

2249
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,453
Yeah.

2250
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,680
Like anything that alluded
to sexual whatever,

2251
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:39,401
it's like,

2252
01:01:39,401 --> 01:01:39,580
no,

2253
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,420
she was ill,

2254
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,550
but they wouldn't even
use the word pregnant.

2255
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,350
They'd be like expecting,

2256
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,530
and they're saying that
he wasn't that big,

2257
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,261
but what,

2258
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:52,990
what the charge was that he had killed
her with his weight while savagely raping

2259
01:01:52,991 --> 01:01:53,171
her.

2260
01:01:53,171 --> 01:01:58,171
It says that the newspapers of the day
reveled in the glory rumor details.

2261
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,070
Juries found little evidence that
Arbuckle wasn't any way connected with her

2262
01:02:03,071 --> 01:02:03,904
death.

2263
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:05,693
Hmm.

2264
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:08,651
Yeah.

2265
01:02:08,651 --> 01:02:12,430
Imagine how many more of those stories
about those like old legends that were

2266
01:02:12,431 --> 01:02:14,890
like considered pristine stars.

2267
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:17,170
And if there was a TMZ back then.

2268
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:18,441
Yeah,

2269
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:18,891
there's two,

2270
01:02:18,891 --> 01:02:20,790
there's a couple of different versions.

2271
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:21,250
Like his,

2272
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:21,560
they,

2273
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,890
this one website has,

2274
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:23,640
um,

2275
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,820
one person's version and
then the fatty Arbuckle vars,

2276
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,100
they're two different versions
of what exactly happened.

2277
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,340
You know Boyan on my friend.

2278
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:34,643
That's fucked.

2279
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:35,991
Yeah.

2280
01:02:35,991 --> 01:02:37,490
How did we get on the
subject of Fatty Arbuckle?

2281
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:38,991
Oh,

2282
01:02:38,991 --> 01:02:41,150
it's because Tom Cruise
is considered crazy.

2283
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,490
Like they probably were a bunch of crazy.

2284
01:02:43,491 --> 01:02:44,840
There's always been crazy celebrity.

2285
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:47,180
That's why it was crazy.

2286
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:47,930
Everything.

2287
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:48,890
People are crazy.

2288
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:52,400
It's just that people done a really good
job of hiding their crazy until they

2289
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,330
shut their doors.

2290
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:54,651
They would get home.

2291
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:57,050
Can I take care of it
by shut that door and

2292
01:02:59,160 --> 01:02:59,993
put up a

2293
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:03,750
ball gag in place.

2294
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:05,803
Yeah.

2295
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,833
Yeah.

2296
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:07,780
Go down there

2297
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:08,613
basement.

2298
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:10,570
Fucking chain themselves up.

2299
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:12,460
Yeah.

2300
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,360
People are crazy.

2301
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,433
We're starting to see it.

2302
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:15,783
It's coming out more.

2303
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,670
It's going to be great when
people want to go back to privacy,

2304
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:22,160
when they want to cherish their privacy,

2305
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:23,983
it's not going to happen.

2306
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:26,240
He'd have to go somewhere
like the big island of Hawaii.

2307
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:27,583
No Internet.

2308
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,120
There's no internet.

2309
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:29,391
No.

2310
01:03:29,391 --> 01:03:29,960
I mean you could,

2311
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,310
you would live there with no internet.

2312
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:31,940
Oh,

2313
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:32,201
okay.

2314
01:03:32,201 --> 01:03:33,510
And there is Internet in the big islands.

2315
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:34,010
Great.

2316
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,080
But if you really want to,

2317
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:36,681
first of all,

2318
01:03:36,681 --> 01:03:38,420
think about the fact that
there's Internet on the big,

2319
01:03:38,421 --> 01:03:39,380
I don't fucking Hawaii,

2320
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:42,950
it takes five hours to
get there on a plane.

2321
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:43,311
Right?

2322
01:03:43,311 --> 01:03:48,311
You fly through the air for five hours
and someone laid fiber across the ocean

2323
01:03:49,341 --> 01:03:50,090
floor.

2324
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:51,260
That is that length.

2325
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,310
I mean that's how it works,

2326
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:53,030
right?

2327
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:53,790
I think so.

2328
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:54,680
I have no idea.

2329
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:55,813
Isn't that how it works?

2330
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,470
Like there has to be a direct line.

2331
01:03:57,471 --> 01:03:59,090
Some under water lines.

2332
01:03:59,091 --> 01:04:00,890
There's underwater line son.

2333
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,300
How exactly,

2334
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:04,140
how did they do that?

2335
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:05,120
The Pacific Ocean.

2336
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:08,810
So they just like were tossing this in
there and let's help like a shark doesn't

2337
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:09,590
non,

2338
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:10,220
okay,

2339
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:10,730
I'm gonna,

2340
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:11,421
I'm gonna Google.

2341
01:04:11,421 --> 01:04:13,430
How do they get Internet in Hawaii

2342
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:17,900
called AOL?

2343
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:18,141
Dude,

2344
01:04:18,141 --> 01:04:18,401
it's one.

2345
01:04:18,401 --> 01:04:20,810
It's one of the first
things that people ask.

2346
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:22,671
Let's see what they say.

2347
01:04:22,671 --> 01:04:23,081
How does it,

2348
01:04:23,081 --> 01:04:23,780
why yet?

2349
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,260
Internet,

2350
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,310
Yahoo Answers.

2351
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:30,790
The unit is provided via a 10,000 miles
sub marine and terrestrial fiber optic

2352
01:04:32,961 --> 01:04:35,150
cable connecting the state.

2353
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:36,650
Six major islands,

2354
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:39,770
which is owned and operated
by Pacific light net.

2355
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,053
Wow.

2356
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,230
10,000 miles,

2357
01:04:42,231 --> 01:04:43,064
dude.

2358
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,050
So there are like cables
connecting all the continence.

2359
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:48,663
Yup.

2360
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,533
That's how,

2361
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:50,231
yeah,

2362
01:04:50,231 --> 01:04:51,240
that's crazy.

2363
01:04:51,241 --> 01:04:53,350
And if you think about that,

2364
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,600
like what part of that?

2365
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,430
Most people don't know like that,

2366
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,690
that part we don't know.

2367
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,160
Like most people aren't
like wait a minute.

2368
01:05:00,161 --> 01:05:02,410
It's all a why there's wires everywhere.

2369
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,420
People don't think of that.

2370
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:05,321
You don't think of that?

2371
01:05:05,321 --> 01:05:08,470
Like you don't think there's like a wire
that goes across the ocean to England

2372
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,830
and that's how he's doing the inner
signals flying through the air.

2373
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,400
The people building railroads
were like this is impressive.

2374
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,020
We link this city,

2375
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,830
that one with all this steel.

2376
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:19,510
Right.

2377
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:23,020
And now it's like there's a cable where
I can just like pick up a thing and send

2378
01:05:23,021 --> 01:05:23,500
a thing.

2379
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:23,711
Yeah.

2380
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,990
And just type of thing and watch a video.

2381
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:26,321
Yeah.

2382
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:26,741
Screw you.

2383
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:28,300
Train two weeks.

2384
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:31,630
That is why he gets really squirrely
when people start talking about like,

2385
01:05:31,631 --> 01:05:32,464
um,

2386
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,500
when you start talking about like videos
that you can and can't watch and other

2387
01:05:35,501 --> 01:05:37,870
countries like why can't I
watch this in South Africa?

2388
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:38,050
Like,

2389
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,570
why can't how come this
is is because the pipe,

2390
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:42,580
like they don't have
agreement with various pipes.

2391
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,433
Yeah.

2392
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,040
I mean that must be it.

2393
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:45,470
Right?

2394
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:48,530
Music licensing also mostly
and things like that.

2395
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:48,911
Yeah.

2396
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:50,790
Music licensing and I'm sure all

2397
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:54,250
so like that there are certain places
like they don't want to waste their

2398
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:56,980
bandwidth on a product that's
not available in your country.

2399
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,160
I'm surprised terrorist is,

2400
01:05:58,161 --> 01:05:59,510
I haven't gotten after these lines.

2401
01:05:59,511 --> 01:05:59,780
Yeah.

2402
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:00,613
That seems like

2403
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,380
why are you giving them great ideas,

2404
01:06:03,381 --> 01:06:03,950
bro?

2405
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:04,820
Just gave it away.

2406
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,560
Oh my God.

2407
01:06:06,561 --> 01:06:08,360
You're so bad for America.

2408
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,230
Allocate is building a
submarine to go down anymore.

2409
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,041
It's Isis.

2410
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:14,360
You got to keep up on your bad guys.

2411
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:15,271
I didn't,

2412
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:16,790
they change it from Isis again.

2413
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:17,720
I do not know.

2414
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:18,021
Well,

2415
01:06:18,021 --> 01:06:18,621
if they were smart,

2416
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:19,940
they would since I know about it.

2417
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:20,471
Right.

2418
01:06:20,471 --> 01:06:21,304
Yeah.

2419
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:23,810
I would say once I know
about your organization,

2420
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,010
it's no longer secret.

2421
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,093
You know,

2422
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:28,000
I need to,

2423
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,540
I mean,

2424
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:33,540
I made a mistake on the last episode I
was on when I saw the video of a Israeli,

2425
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:34,751
uh,

2426
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:36,610
hitting a Powerade stining and kid.

2427
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:37,990
Remember that when I was
talking about the Gig,

2428
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,940
I guess there's just a lot of videos that
they're just saying they're Israelian

2429
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,833
and they're not,

2430
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,410
they're just trying like there's people,

2431
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:44,990
yeah.

2432
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:45,350
That,

2433
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:46,490
that was a real video,

2434
01:06:46,491 --> 01:06:46,971
but it was,

2435
01:06:46,971 --> 01:06:47,390
um,

2436
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:48,110
two other,

2437
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:48,500
uh,

2438
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,311
Arab kids.

2439
01:06:49,311 --> 01:06:49,660
Yeah.

2440
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:52,340
It wasn't Israeli and so all these people,

2441
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,170
angry Jews got on my case.

2442
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,063
Well,

2443
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:56,630
we're sorry,

2444
01:06:56,631 --> 01:06:57,900
angry you.

2445
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,083
He's

2446
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:00,921
angry juice.

2447
01:07:00,921 --> 01:07:01,754
Sweeties

2448
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,123
but uh,

2449
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,840
I think there's some sort
of a cease fire right now.

2450
01:07:04,841 --> 01:07:05,140
Right.

2451
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:05,973
It's not the idea

2452
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:08,010
that's

2453
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:09,170
unless it's already ended

2454
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:09,900
magic.

2455
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,190
We were going to war with Mexico.

2456
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:12,623
Better not,

2457
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,030
but think about it like that's
essentially what's going on.

2458
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,140
Like if where,

2459
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:19,380
where you look at where Israel
is and you look at Gaza,

2460
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:22,380
if that we were going to war with Mexico,

2461
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,620
that would be what it would be like,

2462
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:28,320
like us going back and forth and rockets
from Mexico flying into San Antonio and

2463
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:28,561
we're like,

2464
01:07:28,561 --> 01:07:29,490
what the fuck?

2465
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,000
Right.

2466
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,661
That's real.

2467
01:07:30,661 --> 01:07:32,250
Like that's really what it would be like.

2468
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:32,851
Yeah.

2469
01:07:32,851 --> 01:07:37,080
Like they would like destroy a seven 11
and El Paso and then we would just like

2470
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:40,470
bomb all of Mexico City for
like three straight days.

2471
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,850
But that's why the people in Israel,

2472
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:46,090
one of the things about people in Israel
is those motherfuckers love to party.

2473
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:47,260
Yeah.

2474
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:48,093
I had a friend,

2475
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,360
it was a kickboxing instructor.

2476
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:53,980
I went over his house once for dinner
and a dude is playing the bongos and his

2477
01:07:53,981 --> 01:07:54,341
wife,

2478
01:07:54,341 --> 01:07:55,160
his dancing,

2479
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,280
his kids were dancing and
they were all cooking.

2480
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:57,731
And I was like,

2481
01:07:57,731 --> 01:07:57,851
wow,

2482
01:07:57,851 --> 01:07:58,684
this is crazy.

2483
01:07:59,080 --> 01:07:59,890
And uh,

2484
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:00,701
he's like a,

2485
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:01,181
this is,

2486
01:08:01,181 --> 01:08:02,770
you know how we do it in Israel?

2487
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:03,680
He goes,

2488
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,540
you never know.

2489
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:05,560
One day you die,

2490
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:06,161
you know.

2491
01:08:06,161 --> 01:08:08,020
So today when we lie party,

2492
01:08:08,021 --> 01:08:08,321
party,

2493
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:11,470
party and it was like playing
the Bongo drums and all happy,

2494
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:12,131
I was like,

2495
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:12,910
wow,

2496
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:15,650
that's a perspective you
only get when you've,

2497
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:17,780
you've been involved in that,

2498
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,790
that sort of hellish existence.

2499
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:20,511
Like he,

2500
01:08:20,511 --> 01:08:23,660
I believe he was in the
military for the Israeli army.

2501
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,510
I think it's mandatory
actually for everyone.

2502
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:27,201
But,

2503
01:08:27,201 --> 01:08:27,650
uh,

2504
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:27,921
you know,

2505
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:28,754
and he was a,

2506
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:31,160
he's an interesting guy,

2507
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,610
but always like big smile
on his face and very happy.

2508
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,500
And that was his explanation.

2509
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:37,071
I go,

2510
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:37,251
well,

2511
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:37,470
you know,

2512
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:40,970
how come you guys are always so happy
when I meet someone who's that like

2513
01:08:40,971 --> 01:08:41,804
exuberant?

2514
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,310
That was his explanation.

2515
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:44,443
You never know.

2516
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:44,781
You know,

2517
01:08:44,781 --> 01:08:45,590
you're over there.

2518
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,450
It's just like death,

2519
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:48,560
like bombings.

2520
01:08:48,561 --> 01:08:50,570
Something always terrible.

2521
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:51,350
You never know.

2522
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:52,183
Everyone could die.

2523
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:53,720
So she'll see Heidi.

2524
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:57,680
Patty had different life
with like Israelis and
Palestinians are cause it's like

2525
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,170
there's no way the Palestinians
are partying like that.

2526
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:01,731
That's a good point.

2527
01:09:01,731 --> 01:09:03,200
I think they'd party twice as hard.

2528
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,040
Let's look.

2529
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,710
We're really living
under like at any moment.

2530
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:07,753
Yeah.

2531
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:09,890
Yeah.

2532
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,270
That's a dark situation,

2533
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:12,000
man.

2534
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,770
It really is.

2535
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:13,670
It's very dark.

2536
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:14,930
Like I asked my parents,

2537
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:15,680
they're from Lebanon,

2538
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,513
my parents,

2539
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,990
it's like they grew up in,

2540
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:18,980
around all that.

2541
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:19,370
You know,

2542
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:20,450
they were like Christian,

2543
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:20,841
you know,

2544
01:09:20,841 --> 01:09:21,260
so they,

2545
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:22,160
they just got out of there.

2546
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:22,401
They're like,

2547
01:09:22,401 --> 01:09:23,330
we need to get out of here.

2548
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,430
But every time I'd ask them about it,

2549
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:26,210
they would just like,

2550
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:26,421
I'm like,

2551
01:09:26,421 --> 01:09:29,000
what do you think about what's
going on in Israel and Gaza now?

2552
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:29,511
All this stuff.

2553
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:30,890
And they just look at me like,

2554
01:09:30,891 --> 01:09:31,770
what do you mean and mean?

2555
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,690
What do you think's going to happen?

2556
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:33,523
And they're like,

2557
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:36,440
the same thing that's always going to
happen is they're going to keep fighting

2558
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:37,910
and it's never going to end.

2559
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,020
But they just look at it like
it's not even worth talking about.

2560
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,140
I said,

2561
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:44,311
yeah,

2562
01:09:44,311 --> 01:09:46,040
it's really like dark
and you're just like,

2563
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:46,933
good Lord.

2564
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:52,850
Like they just got so used to it like
growing up that like war is a thing.

2565
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:57,740
Like I went to Lebanon when I was 13 I
took a v like go back to the homeland

2566
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:58,603
kind of thing.

2567
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,030
And like you're in the southern
parts of the country and,

2568
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:04,880
and I'd never seen anything like
this growing up in the suburbs of La.

2569
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:08,720
But like you're sitting in a village
and then there's like a guy tending like

2570
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:09,231
cattle,

2571
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:10,220
there's like goats.

2572
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:15,610
And then five minutes later a tank
just drives through a dirt road in the

2573
01:10:15,861 --> 01:10:16,694
village.

2574
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:18,710
No one bats an eye,

2575
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:19,670
no one.

2576
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:20,720
But meanwhile I'm like,

2577
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:21,801
you know,

2578
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:22,551
just pointing.

2579
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,360
I'm like that's it.

2580
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,200
Tank.

2581
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:25,101
And they're like,

2582
01:10:25,101 --> 01:10:26,120
yeah that happens like two,

2583
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:26,954
three times a day.

2584
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,300
Like Israeli tanks and Lebanese tanks
and there's soldiers with fully automatic

2585
01:10:32,301 --> 01:10:37,040
weapons walking through towns and
that's just like a normal part of life.

2586
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:40,470
Well have you ever done a gig
that's unlike a military town?

2587
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:41,363
No.

2588
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:42,600
Whenever you do a,

2589
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,370
anytime a you're on the road,

2590
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:49,110
like if you're near Camp Pendleton or
Fort Bragg or any of these like military

2591
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:49,561
basis.

2592
01:10:49,561 --> 01:10:52,500
Like if you have a gig anywhere nearby,

2593
01:10:52,501 --> 01:10:53,760
then you hang out there for a day,

2594
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:55,380
you're going to see like military trucks,

2595
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:56,431
you're going to see,

2596
01:10:56,431 --> 01:10:57,030
you know,

2597
01:10:57,030 --> 01:11:00,450
Cam owed up jeeps and Humvees
and all these different troops,

2598
01:11:00,451 --> 01:11:02,730
like constantly moving back
and forth left and right.

2599
01:11:02,731 --> 01:11:03,780
Like if you're close to that,

2600
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:05,040
you see it all the time.

2601
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:05,550
Yeah,

2602
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:06,330
it's weird.

2603
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:06,811
It's weird.

2604
01:11:06,811 --> 01:11:07,644
If you're not used to it,

2605
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:07,981
you're like,

2606
01:11:07,981 --> 01:11:08,580
wait a minute,

2607
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:09,810
that's a killing machine.

2608
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,340
That's what a tank is.

2609
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:11,810
Oh,

2610
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:12,491
it's good for it to do.

2611
01:11:12,491 --> 01:11:14,700
It was doing was looking for trouble.

2612
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:17,640
I mean to like find if
there is any trouble.

2613
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:20,570
Could you imagine if you saw that tank
and then all of a sudden fucking alarms

2614
01:11:20,571 --> 01:11:23,990
start going off in the shit starts
flying and you're sitting there like real

2615
01:11:23,991 --> 01:11:24,950
close this tank.

2616
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,240
Well that's getting shot at.

2617
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,710
That happened when we were like,

2618
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:28,341
we're slow.

2619
01:11:28,341 --> 01:11:30,260
We went to sleep in
the village that night.

2620
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:35,510
The night before we went back up to
the city in Beirut and like my younger

2621
01:11:35,511 --> 01:11:40,040
brother and I just heard these distant
like noises and we like ask my mom like

2622
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:40,721
what are those noise?

2623
01:11:40,721 --> 01:11:41,554
And she does not a worry.

2624
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,680
It's nothing to worry about it.

2625
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:44,480
Then the next day we were like,

2626
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,010
so what were those noises like?

2627
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:46,761
You wouldn't tell us.

2628
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:47,391
And she's like,

2629
01:11:47,391 --> 01:11:52,391
those were bombs going off
like five miles away from us.

2630
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:54,623
Yeah.

2631
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:59,890
So it was like terrorists bombing
each other five miles away from us.

2632
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:03,943
Yo.

2633
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,880
And you're that 13 year
old kid and you're like,

2634
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:11,690
I like grew up in a suburb of La.

2635
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:13,100
It's just,

2636
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,660
it couldn't be safer.

2637
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:20,350
Like six cops will pull you over for
smoking a cigarette and five miles away.

2638
01:12:20,391 --> 01:12:22,640
It's like people are
destroying each other.

2639
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,480
Wow.

2640
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:23,891
Israel,

2641
01:12:23,891 --> 01:12:26,210
it really helped like shaped
my perspective of what it,

2642
01:12:26,211 --> 01:12:28,700
what it's like to live in
America and grow up in America.

2643
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:33,560
Cause I that could have been me like I
kind of like live there and maybe who

2644
01:12:33,561 --> 01:12:35,270
knows if I would've gotten to age 30,

2645
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,081
31,

2646
01:12:36,081 --> 01:12:36,730
32 and then,

2647
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:37,563
yeah,

2648
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:38,860
that's absolutely true.

2649
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,200
We're all stupid.

2650
01:12:41,201 --> 01:12:41,560
Lucky.

2651
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,250
Oh yeah.

2652
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:45,340
That we landed on this spot
because you get a landed anywhere.

2653
01:12:45,341 --> 01:12:46,720
You could be in the
Congo right now and go,

2654
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:49,750
oh well how do I get out of this

2655
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:53,380
Bola like under the armpit?

2656
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:53,771
Yeah.

2657
01:12:53,771 --> 01:12:55,600
They get ready to hit the big like uh,

2658
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:59,410
like thick boobos or what they
call like the bubonic plague.

2659
01:12:59,411 --> 01:13:01,300
That's where that term comes
from to get these giant,

2660
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,570
oh it's like blood or something like that.

2661
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:04,421
Yeah.

2662
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:04,691
Your,

2663
01:13:04,691 --> 01:13:05,081
your,

2664
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:07,920
your lymph nodes are
your feet swell up with,

2665
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:12,190
there's some people have
read that are immune to it.

2666
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:12,980
Me,

2667
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:15,730
that'd be like me and everything bro.

2668
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:16,250
Hemp powder,

2669
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:16,570
Bro.

2670
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:17,560
You can't fuck with me bro.

2671
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:23,350
Tribal guys that like it goes through
so much that like dupont and play good

2672
01:13:23,351 --> 01:13:23,561
ball,

2673
01:13:23,561 --> 01:13:24,360
all these things they like,

2674
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,470
they get it and then nothing happens.

2675
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:27,493
Wow.

2676
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:28,221
That's cool.

2677
01:13:28,221 --> 01:13:29,054
Genetics.

2678
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:30,710
But you have to be a travel guy,

2679
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:31,870
right?

2680
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:32,070
Oh,

2681
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:32,903
we have to.

2682
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:35,930
It's probably just get a
little bit of Ebola every day,

2683
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:36,650
you know,

2684
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:38,180
and develop an immunity to it.

2685
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,050
No,

2686
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:40,520
I think it's a hemorrhagic virus,

2687
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:40,820
right?

2688
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:41,631
Isn't it one of those?

2689
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,464
Um,

2690
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:44,120
I think it's one of those
ones that makes you bleed.

2691
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,010
Um,

2692
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:48,350
is it the same one that
like liquefies or insights?

2693
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,030
Something bad like that.

2694
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:50,840
That's what I heard.

2695
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,570
Liquified not good and
they just sent some,

2696
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:56,180
they just sent someone to America,

2697
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:56,690
right?

2698
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:58,160
To people to Atlanta.

2699
01:13:59,090 --> 01:13:59,361
Yeah.

2700
01:13:59,361 --> 01:14:01,010
It's a hemorrhagic fever.

2701
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:04,460
It's a human disease
caused by the Ebola virus.

2702
01:14:04,461 --> 01:14:09,080
Symptoms typically start two to three
weeks after two days to three weeks after

2703
01:14:09,081 --> 01:14:10,940
contracting the virus with a fever,

2704
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:11,501
throat,

2705
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:12,730
muscle pains and headaches.

2706
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,050
Typically nausea,

2707
01:14:14,051 --> 01:14:15,160
vomiting and diarrhea.

2708
01:14:15,161 --> 01:14:18,880
Follow along with the decreased
functioning of the liver and kidneys.

2709
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:20,021
At this point,

2710
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:22,450
some people begin to
have bleeding problems.

2711
01:14:22,451 --> 01:14:25,810
The virus may be acquired upon contact
with blood or bodily fluids of an

2712
01:14:25,811 --> 01:14:26,950
infected animal,

2713
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,960
commonly monkeys or fruit bats.

2714
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:33,180
So somebody fucked a bat or a
monkey and that's how we got it,

2715
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:37,210
but most likely so he got super
crazy and fucked a monkey or a bat.

2716
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,030
It's unnaturally
transmitted through the air.

2717
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:44,020
Fruit bats are believed to carry and
spread the virus without being effected.

2718
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,033
Hmm.

2719
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,450
Once human infection occurs,

2720
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:48,790
the disease may spread
between people as well.

2721
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:53,791
Male survivors may be able to transmit
the disease via seaman for nearly two

2722
01:14:54,341 --> 01:14:55,174
months.

2723
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:56,080
Wow.

2724
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,580
In order to make the diagnosis.

2725
01:14:57,581 --> 01:15:01,300
Typically other disease with
similar symptoms such as malaria,

2726
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:02,403
cholera,

2727
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:06,760
and other viral hemorrhagic
fevers are first excluded.

2728
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,493
Wow.

2729
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:09,400
This is deep shit,

2730
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:10,234
man.

2731
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:11,740
No special,

2732
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:13,570
no specific treatment for the disease.

2733
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:17,440
[inaudible] efforts to help persons who
are in fact include giving them either

2734
01:15:17,441 --> 01:15:19,270
oral rehydration therapy,

2735
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:21,220
slightly sweet and salt,

2736
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,180
slightly water to a slightly salty
water to drink or intravenous fluids.

2737
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:27,940
The disease has a high mortality rate,

2738
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:32,230
often killing between 50 and
90% of those infected whoa,

2739
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,753
whoa.

2740
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:38,620
It was first identified in Sudan and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

2741
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:44,700
the disease typically occurs in outbreaks
in tropical regions of the Subsaharan

2742
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:44,831
Africa.

2743
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:45,730
It's always Africa.

2744
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:48,460
It's always Africa.

2745
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,740
That's where whatever gets us
is going to get out of Africa.

2746
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:52,300
You know,

2747
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:52,561
when I,

2748
01:15:52,561 --> 01:15:52,761
uh,

2749
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:54,010
I did that Scifi show,

2750
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:58,150
that was the scariest part was the dealing
with the infectious diseases by far

2751
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:00,190
what asked people about diseases,

2752
01:16:00,191 --> 01:16:01,810
like what we really have to worry about.

2753
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,600
The scariest thing they were
saying wasn't terrorism.

2754
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:09,810
It was just a disease that morphs just
something that becomes like super potent

2755
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:11,320
and kills a ton of people.

2756
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:16,000
Something like they had that Spanish flu
that it killed a bunch of people in the

2757
01:16:16,001 --> 01:16:16,960
early 19 hundreds.

2758
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:17,570
Yeah.

2759
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:18,970
The 1920s or whatever.

2760
01:16:18,971 --> 01:16:19,330
Yeah.

2761
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:22,120
And apparently it started
on the military base Q,

2762
01:16:22,121 --> 01:16:23,020
the conspiracy theories.

2763
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:24,423
But um,

2764
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:25,211
the,

2765
01:16:25,211 --> 01:16:25,820
um,

2766
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:26,150
the,

2767
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:26,610
the,

2768
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:29,890
the thing that was really deadly about
it was that it would go after young

2769
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:30,730
healthy men,

2770
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:31,751
that it would,

2771
01:16:31,751 --> 01:16:33,150
people with strong immune systems.

2772
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,540
It would shut down their immune system.

2773
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:35,390
It would like,

2774
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,850
it would kill them quick,

2775
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:38,650
which is like really strange.

2776
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:42,520
You know that it like it was almost
designed to take out healthy people.

2777
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:43,261
Yeah.

2778
01:16:43,261 --> 01:16:44,430
Cause normally a flu is,

2779
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,860
it's like children and old people.

2780
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:47,590
Yeah.

2781
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:47,771
Yeah.

2782
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:49,630
Babies and old people
have to worry about it,

2783
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:52,070
but most young people survive.

2784
01:16:52,071 --> 01:16:52,904
But that's,

2785
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,000
you know,

2786
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
it's a creepy thought that at any time
something could happen and some virus

2787
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:03,580
could morph and turn it into some new
thing that we don't know how to deal with.

2788
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:04,021
Yeah.

2789
01:17:04,021 --> 01:17:06,300
And someone's sneezing
on you at an airport.

2790
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:06,690
Yeah.

2791
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:09,060
Wipe out 5% of human civilization

2792
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,330
about this Ebola,

2793
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,460
90% of the people die.

2794
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:14,181
Okay.

2795
01:17:14,181 --> 01:17:15,200
If that's the high number.

2796
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,640
What if everyone got Ebola?

2797
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,140
Just think of that.

2798
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,490
If one person get Ebola,

2799
01:17:19,491 --> 01:17:21,740
what's to say that everyone
can't get Ebola while,

2800
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:23,960
because there were specific
protocols in place.

2801
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,400
Stop that from yes,

2802
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:26,630
most likely.

2803
01:17:26,631 --> 01:17:29,030
I'm just being crazy.

2804
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:29,893
Most likely.

2805
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,730
Most people are not going to get Ebola,

2806
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,660
but if they did,

2807
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,550
what we're saying is at least halfway die.

2808
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:35,420
Yeah.

2809
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:35,900
That's,

2810
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,880
that's some catastrophic shit.

2811
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:40,520
It's like with the way the
world is interconnected,

2812
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:43,580
it's like that could like
Tsa doesn't check for Ebola,

2813
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:47,540
like it could get through an
airport and the next thing you know,

2814
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:49,350
oh well listen to what that just said,

2815
01:17:49,351 --> 01:17:50,184
that it doesn't,

2816
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,210
it doesn't necessarily,

2817
01:17:51,211 --> 01:17:52,800
the symptoms don't show up that quickly.

2818
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:56,310
Two days to three weeks.

2819
01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:58,800
Three weeks is a long time.

2820
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:00,670
You contract a virus and then you,

2821
01:18:00,671 --> 01:18:05,120
you have that virus for three weeks
and you don't know if you travel a lot.

2822
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:07,710
Travel and licking your hand
and touching things everywhere.

2823
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:09,330
High five and people.

2824
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:11,310
Yeah,

2825
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:11,701
you could.

2826
01:18:11,701 --> 01:18:13,740
You could spread that shit for sure.

2827
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,020
Coughing on a subway,

2828
01:18:15,021 --> 01:18:17,420
like there's so many small,

2829
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,280
you think about it,

2830
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,760
it's on their hand and
gives you a hand job.

2831
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:21,823
Right?

2832
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:23,480
That's how you got Ebola.

2833
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:23,781
You're like,

2834
01:18:23,781 --> 01:18:24,650
God damn,

2835
01:18:24,651 --> 01:18:26,420
really the hottest shit.

2836
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:29,420
Her eyes were really red.

2837
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:30,620
She was probably just high,

2838
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:33,770
but now I feel like temperature,

2839
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:35,541
she was so hot.

2840
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:36,620
She gave me a temperature.

2841
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:39,410
I think she gave me something and
I just got to planned parenthood.

2842
01:18:39,411 --> 01:18:40,244
They'll figure it.

2843
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:41,741
Planned parenthood.

2844
01:18:41,741 --> 01:18:43,160
So what do I have for Ebola?

2845
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,330
And you be getting a and
jobs from African Jag,

2846
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:49,491
African.

2847
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:50,630
She looks like you have,

2848
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:51,890
we need you to leave immediately.

2849
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:52,783
That's what you have.

2850
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:53,320
Yeah.

2851
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,210
So this the woman,

2852
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,670
the second patient,

2853
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:58,210
uh,

2854
01:18:58,210 --> 01:18:58,421
you know,

2855
01:18:58,421 --> 01:18:59,620
there was two patients that,

2856
01:18:59,621 --> 01:19:00,454
uh,

2857
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:05,410
that flew into America apparently weak
but improving the second American Ebola

2858
01:19:05,411 --> 01:19:09,910
patient to arrive in the u us soil was
wheeled into an Atlanta hospital Tuesday

2859
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:11,680
by workers in biohazard suits.

2860
01:19:11,681 --> 01:19:12,640
You should see the picture,

2861
01:19:12,641 --> 01:19:12,881
man.

2862
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:13,780
It's freaky.

2863
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:18,400
The picture is them wheeling
her into its dark dude.

2864
01:19:18,401 --> 01:19:19,270
Pull that picture up.

2865
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:20,530
Pull this picture up.

2866
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:27,710
There was somebody that they had to a
video where they showed him this like news

2867
01:19:27,711 --> 01:19:31,640
guy that was hiding in a Bush taking
video or photos of this and he wasn't

2868
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:32,474
wearing a suit though.

2869
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:33,020
And it was just like,

2870
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:33,261
oh,

2871
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:36,380
he's like feet away from this
person not wearing a suit.

2872
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:37,670
This is how it happens.

2873
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:38,630
This is dumb.

2874
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:39,430
Oh yeah.

2875
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:44,430
That would be like a plot in like the
old episode of the incredible hulk.

2876
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:47,050
Right.

2877
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:49,120
That would be out of the
guy gets the super disease.

2878
01:19:49,121 --> 01:19:49,750
Yeah.

2879
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:50,980
I'm just trying to do my job,

2880
01:19:50,981 --> 01:19:51,281
man.

2881
01:19:51,281 --> 01:19:52,114
I'm a reporter.

2882
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:53,583
Look at that.

2883
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:56,740
It's so weird looking at them taking that,

2884
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:00,610
that Gurney and pushing
it in this space suits.

2885
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,170
That's madness.

2886
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,430
Ge Ti Hu.

2887
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:04,600
That's so scary.

2888
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:06,610
Ooo,

2889
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,473
that's so,

2890
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,740
I wonder if it's like 90% though if it,

2891
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:14,160
if it happened in developed nations
with like hospitals and shit.

2892
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,840
I don't know man.

2893
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:18,570
Cause in tribes like an African show,

2894
01:20:18,571 --> 01:20:19,680
when people get it they're like,

2895
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:21,300
oh the diseases back.

2896
01:20:21,301 --> 01:20:21,991
Like what did we do?

2897
01:20:21,991 --> 01:20:22,561
Like we'll just,

2898
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:22,950
you know,

2899
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:26,610
start a fire and like chant to the
gods and like hope that it goes away.

2900
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:32,240
More than 1400 Ebola cases have been
confirmed in the worst known outbreak of

2901
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:35,550
the disease and more than
800 people have died.

2902
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:38,850
Most of these cases have been
the countries of Guinnea,

2903
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:40,260
Guinea,

2904
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,180
Liberia and Sierra Leone,

2905
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:48,950
experimental drug or anything else about
the infections ultimately leads to an a

2906
01:20:48,951 --> 01:20:49,221
bowl,

2907
01:20:49,221 --> 01:20:49,701
a cure.

2908
01:20:49,701 --> 01:20:50,540
That would be incredible.

2909
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:53,270
This doctor saying this is dark shit dude.

2910
01:20:53,271 --> 01:20:56,150
I didn't know that this was the
worst outbreak of Ebola ever.

2911
01:20:57,710 --> 01:20:58,543
Did you know that?

2912
01:20:58,790 --> 01:20:59,623
No.

2913
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:00,733
Yeah.

2914
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:02,800
Wow.

2915
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,580
Those in countries like that too.

2916
01:21:04,581 --> 01:21:04,971
They're like,

2917
01:21:04,971 --> 01:21:05,181
well,

2918
01:21:05,181 --> 01:21:05,690
what?

2919
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:06,710
What next?

2920
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:07,791
I know,

2921
01:21:07,791 --> 01:21:08,180
right?

2922
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:09,590
Like what could be worse?

2923
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:14,510
Both aid workers received doses of it
experimentally bullet drug derived in part

2924
01:21:14,511 --> 01:21:19,511
from tobacco plants and never before
tested on humans before they left Liberia.

2925
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:23,390
Brantley got an additional dose at Emory.

2926
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:25,243
Wow,

2927
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:29,503
man,

2928
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,730
that's scary shit.

2929
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:32,081
Yeah,

2930
01:21:32,081 --> 01:21:32,890
it's pretty crazy.

2931
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:33,071
You know,

2932
01:21:33,071 --> 01:21:34,930
whenever there's a movie like that,

2933
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:39,931
a world war Z or any of those movies
like it's always the same beginning and

2934
01:21:40,691 --> 01:21:43,060
it's the beginning just like this,

2935
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:45,760
like you're reading a
story and you're like,

2936
01:21:45,761 --> 01:21:47,800
do you think this is really this,

2937
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:48,790
this sounds really bad,

2938
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:49,990
and then one of us would be like,

2939
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:50,501
Nah,

2940
01:21:50,501 --> 01:21:51,334
it's nothing.

2941
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,210
It's nothing to worry about.

2942
01:21:52,211 --> 01:21:53,080
They got on the control.

2943
01:21:53,081 --> 01:21:53,800
That's what they do.

2944
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:54,850
These guys are great ad.

2945
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:57,180
That's why it is a CDC guys.

2946
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:57,810
Anyway,

2947
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:02,130
I'm headed to the airport to get on a
flight and he's the guy who lands and he's

2948
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:04,410
itchy and it's fucking eyes are bleeding.

2949
01:22:04,411 --> 01:22:05,370
What's going on man?

2950
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:06,180
Nothing.

2951
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:06,691
I'll be fine.

2952
01:22:06,691 --> 01:22:08,610
I got to go home and hug
my wife and children.

2953
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:10,650
You really should take a look at you.

2954
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:10,951
No,

2955
01:22:10,951 --> 01:22:11,221
no,

2956
01:22:11,221 --> 01:22:11,461
no,

2957
01:22:11,461 --> 01:22:11,701
no,

2958
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:11,911
no.

2959
01:22:11,911 --> 01:22:12,720
I'm fine.

2960
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:13,650
I'm fine.

2961
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,513
Thank you.

2962
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,430
Now I've got to go to this sporting event.

2963
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:22,110
I've got front row tickets to the Lakers
game and I'm not going to miss it.

2964
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:27,070
And he goes there and the Lakers win
and you see him high five and everybody

2965
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:27,913
sweating.

2966
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:29,560
Yeah,

2967
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,280
he's doing blown the bathroom.

2968
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:32,123
I feel like shit.

2969
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:36,150
She does a couple of bumps and he's
high five and everybody sharing needles

2970
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,420
just spreading.

2971
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:40,590
You've never done heroin,

2972
01:22:40,591 --> 01:22:42,920
but I'll try it today bro.

2973
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:43,980
Yo Lo,

2974
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:46,540
he's doing heroin.

2975
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:47,510
Joe Lowe.

2976
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:49,263
Yeah,

2977
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:50,523
man.

2978
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:51,370
It could happen.

2979
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,150
There's a lot of selfish
fucking people to oh yeah.

2980
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,270
This is a lot of people that,

2981
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:55,840
you know,

2982
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,710
I could get HIV.

2983
01:22:56,711 --> 01:22:57,700
They don't tell people.

2984
01:22:57,730 --> 01:22:58,511
That's a big one,

2985
01:22:58,511 --> 01:22:58,750
man.

2986
01:22:58,750 --> 01:22:59,583
That's a big one.

2987
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:00,580
John Holmes.

2988
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:01,201
Yeah,

2989
01:23:01,201 --> 01:23:02,034
I did it.

2990
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:02,501
Yeah.

2991
01:23:02,501 --> 01:23:02,801
This is,

2992
01:23:02,801 --> 01:23:04,360
I mean that's um,

2993
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:06,190
that's,

2994
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,950
it's a weird thing like you think like
if someone caught the Zombie disease and

2995
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:13,951
they knew they had the Zama disease but
they knew that it didn't show up for a

2996
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:14,111
couple of weeks,

2997
01:23:14,111 --> 01:23:15,790
but they get transmitted to people,

2998
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:17,650
would they still fuck I say they would.

2999
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:18,110
Yeah,

3000
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:18,943
they probably would

3001
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:19,860
be on my side.

3002
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:20,690
I want you to be honest.

3003
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:22,770
I don't want to be the only
one with a Zombie disease.

3004
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:27,490
A dude was drinking or seedy hotel room
when he ordered up a stripper and he

3005
01:23:27,491 --> 01:23:28,660
knew he had the Zombie disease.

3006
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:29,860
I could totally see the

3007
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:33,160
zombies eaves fucking spread.

3008
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,210
That's all you'd have to do,

3009
01:23:34,211 --> 01:23:34,391
right?

3010
01:23:34,391 --> 01:23:34,900
Yeah.

3011
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,440
They find a way to rationalize.

3012
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:36,731
Well,

3013
01:23:36,731 --> 01:23:37,900
everyone's going to get it anyway.

3014
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:38,740
Exactly.

3015
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:41,350
And she asked me if I had
chlamydia or gonorrhea.

3016
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,910
I said I didn't lie.

3017
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:43,361
I said,

3018
01:23:43,361 --> 01:23:44,194
I didn't have that.

3019
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:45,960
Have,

3020
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:46,771
can you get a broad?

3021
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:47,860
The sooner you accept that,

3022
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:48,610
yeah.

3023
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:49,001
Quicker.

3024
01:23:49,001 --> 01:23:50,710
You get some of the suites we push it.

3025
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:51,261
Yeah.

3026
01:23:51,261 --> 01:23:52,094
No one ever asked,

3027
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:53,600
you don't have this Zombie disease.

3028
01:23:53,601 --> 01:23:54,140
Do,

3029
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:55,840
what are you even talking about?

3030
01:23:55,850 --> 01:23:56,810
That's crazy.

3031
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,340
So what disease are you fucking see?

3032
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:00,203
Fucking news.

3033
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,200
Why would I have come on.

3034
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:04,373
Yeah.

3035
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:05,551
Yeah.

3036
01:24:05,551 --> 01:24:07,020
There could be something dark man.

3037
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,990
There could be some really crazy AVN.

3038
01:24:09,991 --> 01:24:12,930
Swine monkey flew the comes along,

3039
01:24:12,931 --> 01:24:14,130
but they just don't see common.

3040
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,833
Especially these,

3041
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:17,610
these hammer Rogerick ones.

3042
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:18,540
Ooh,

3043
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:19,560
those are terrified.

3044
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,280
Yeah.

3045
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:23,130
We should take these two people that
they flew to Atlanta and just like drop

3046
01:24:23,131 --> 01:24:26,730
them off in North Korea and you just
watch them walk around and you need to

3047
01:24:26,731 --> 01:24:27,480
study them.

3048
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,170
Find out whether or not
the drugs work on them.

3049
01:24:29,171 --> 01:24:30,004
Dummy.

3050
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:33,400
It seems like find out like
how to fix these people.

3051
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,640
Like when they put a lot
of money into these things,

3052
01:24:36,641 --> 01:24:37,840
like these kinds of projects,

3053
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:39,820
like they have a new drugs,

3054
01:24:39,821 --> 01:24:41,980
the trying to test if it works,

3055
01:24:41,981 --> 01:24:45,040
the amount of money that they
can make from it is giant.

3056
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,750
So they're probably working really
hard on developing some sort of a cure.

3057
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:50,780
And if they they,

3058
01:24:50,781 --> 01:24:51,790
they had enough hope in it.

3059
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:53,140
They injected people with,

3060
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,460
it's a good sign.

3061
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:54,791
You know,

3062
01:24:54,791 --> 01:24:56,320
it doesn't mean it's
going to be effective,

3063
01:24:56,321 --> 01:24:59,470
but it means they probably have done a
lot of work with it already and they're

3064
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:00,970
pretty sure it does something good.

3065
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:02,770
They're not just taking wild guesses.

3066
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:04,990
Let's just inject him with the
first thing that comes to mind.

3067
01:25:04,991 --> 01:25:05,650
Tobacco.

3068
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:05,960
Okay,

3069
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:06,430
let's do it.

3070
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:06,791
Fuck it.

3071
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:07,624
Tobacco,

3072
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:08,410
you know there,

3073
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:12,820
there's must be some sort of a reason
drugmakers stock falls after big pop.

3074
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:16,463
Hmm.

3075
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:19,670
Why is it knowing ball vaccine,

3076
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:21,470
there is no cure for Ebola.

3077
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:23,240
Do this is the beginning of
Gone Gundam horror movie.

3078
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:25,650
Is it people that have it
don't have credit cards?

3079
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:30,120
Like why would create a vaccine
or a or a drug for people I like,

3080
01:25:30,121 --> 01:25:31,450
we can pay you in goats.

3081
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:34,620
It's true.

3082
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:36,120
Here's this an Adobe hut.

3083
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:37,700
Could you imagine if we found out,

3084
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,460
and I'm sure someone will
suggest it's black helicopters,

3085
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:46,100
but someone will suggest that the reason
why this Ebola outbreak has happened

3086
01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:49,960
was because someone poisoned
a bunch of people with a bola.

3087
01:25:49,961 --> 01:25:50,900
It's been shown,

3088
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:55,580
they injected a bola in the drinking
water of this tribe so that they could

3089
01:25:55,581 --> 01:25:56,120
spread,

3090
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,280
the aid workers would bring
it back home with them

3091
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:03,950
and then next thing you know this
pharmaceutical drug companies making of

3092
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:04,660
dollars.

3093
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,493
Yeah,

3094
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:06,080
right.

3095
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,280
Someone's going to suggest that,

3096
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:09,970
but it could just be a bola motherfucker.

3097
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:10,760
All right.

3098
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,240
Yeah,

3099
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:11,771
could be.

3100
01:26:11,771 --> 01:26:12,800
It could just be nature.

3101
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:14,120
People escaped.

3102
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:15,170
They weren't supposed to.

3103
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:16,280
They quarantine people.

3104
01:26:16,281 --> 01:26:17,150
People got out.

3105
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:18,080
It spread.

3106
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:18,950
Lots of people die.

3107
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:22,100
They could just be that too
and it's most likely just that,

3108
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:23,450
but it's scary.

3109
01:26:24,190 --> 01:26:25,040
It's scary as fuck.

3110
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:28,250
It just shows you how easy it is
for that shit to actually spread.

3111
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:31,940
Like everything doesn't have to be a
conspiracy to be totally terrifying.

3112
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:35,510
Just a disease like this is
fucking totally terrifying.

3113
01:26:35,511 --> 01:26:38,690
It doesn't have to be manufactured by
the government like everybody has this

3114
01:26:38,691 --> 01:26:39,051
idea.

3115
01:26:39,051 --> 01:26:40,130
When one of these things happens,

3116
01:26:40,131 --> 01:26:41,980
like one of the first things
that you start reading about,

3117
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,000
it's like these government instituted
programs with a design viruses that could

3118
01:26:49,461 --> 01:26:53,120
not be fought off dark smokey room,

3119
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:55,250
hello world population.

3120
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,350
They want to lower the world population.

3121
01:26:57,351 --> 01:26:59,150
To 500,000 worldwide.

3122
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,470
How do you think they're going to do that?

3123
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:02,060
Oh,

3124
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:02,620
okay.

3125
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:02,850
Yeah.

3126
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:03,080
You're like,

3127
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:03,621
I don't know,

3128
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:06,620
but why to pocket billions of dollars.

3129
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:07,970
They will own everything.

3130
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:10,610
500,000 hookers and them

3131
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:13,323
nation.

3132
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:15,800
That's been 500,000 people.

3133
01:27:15,801 --> 01:27:16,634
It's not a lot.

3134
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:17,691
That's what the,

3135
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:17,920
uh,

3136
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,720
isn't that what the Georgia Guidestones
doesn't that say something like that?

3137
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:23,180
So I was like 500 million worldwide,

3138
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:24,081
you know,

3139
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:25,310
the Georgia Guidestones.

3140
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,323
What does that,

3141
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:31,420
the Georgia Guidestones are these really
tall pieces of stone that were carved

3142
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:37,181
in several different languages with
guides for how to run a civilization.

3143
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:38,960
Whoa,

3144
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:39,590
I remember that.

3145
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:40,100
Yeah.

3146
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:40,670
Whoa,

3147
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:41,660
this a here,

3148
01:27:41,730 --> 01:27:43,640
I'll pull it up cause
it's pretty interesting.

3149
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:47,390
The Georgia Guidestones
like the guy who made him,

3150
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,490
I'm not sure who that is,

3151
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:50,750
but he,

3152
01:27:50,751 --> 01:27:51,584
uh,

3153
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:56,650
he actually had some good
guides as far as like how to,

3154
01:27:56,751 --> 01:27:57,584
uh,

3155
01:27:57,710 --> 01:27:58,543
how to,

3156
01:27:58,550 --> 01:28:00,050
how to manage a civilization.

3157
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:00,470
Not,

3158
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:01,303
you know,

3159
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:02,570
they're not perfect,

3160
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:05,150
but they're kind of interesting.

3161
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:07,190
Um,

3162
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:12,250
here maintain humanity under 500 million
in perpetual balance with nature.

3163
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:16,340
That's one to guide reproduction wisely.

3164
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:20,300
Improving fitness and
diversity guide reproduction.

3165
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:21,163
Meaning,

3166
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:24,070
that's like engine engineering,

3167
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:24,890
reproduction.

3168
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:26,330
I mean like a eugenics.

3169
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:27,463
Yeah.

3170
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:28,670
What they're doing is like,

3171
01:28:28,671 --> 01:28:31,850
you could say that this is some
sort of an evil plot and it may be,

3172
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:35,420
but it also might be that they're just
trying to look at it in what you would

3173
01:28:35,421 --> 01:28:37,640
consider it cold and calculated manner.

3174
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:41,300
But if you looked at it in
Nicole and calculating manner,

3175
01:28:41,301 --> 01:28:43,100
I'm not telling you that
anybody should do this,

3176
01:28:43,101 --> 01:28:44,030
but if you did,

3177
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:49,370
you would want to take the smartest
females and breed them with the smartest

3178
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:51,770
males and the ones who
had the most good habits,

3179
01:28:51,771 --> 01:28:53,210
the months who their most fit.

3180
01:28:53,450 --> 01:28:57,350
You would want them to be the ones that
would be raising children more often.

3181
01:28:57,890 --> 01:28:58,340
You know,

3182
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:00,950
it's just like what you would
do if you were raising dogs.

3183
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:02,150
That's an interesting one.

3184
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:02,810
Yeah.

3185
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:04,160
Obama is a Muslim.

3186
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:06,740
Is that on the Georgia
Guidestones it is now.

3187
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:08,330
So he spray painted it.

3188
01:29:08,331 --> 01:29:09,290
That's so rude.

3189
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:10,930
What else does it say here?

3190
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:11,350
Um,

3191
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:14,860
unite humanity with a living new language.

3192
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,330
Whoa.

3193
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,310
That's interesting.

3194
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:18,850
Huh?

3195
01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:19,780
That's interesting.

3196
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:25,130
It doesn't say like emojis a living

3197
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:26,410
new language.

3198
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:27,251
That's interesting.

3199
01:29:27,251 --> 01:29:29,650
Like I'm a language for
all of humanity that would,

3200
01:29:29,651 --> 01:29:32,560
that would really help for sure.

3201
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:33,131
Rule,

3202
01:29:33,131 --> 01:29:33,761
passion,

3203
01:29:33,761 --> 01:29:34,360
faith,

3204
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,960
tradition and all things
with tempered reason.

3205
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:39,583
I'm cry.

3206
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,320
That's just common sense,

3207
01:29:41,321 --> 01:29:41,830
right?

3208
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:45,340
Protect people and nations
with fair laws and just courts.

3209
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:46,773
That's Kinda Duh.

3210
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:47,410
Yeah.

3211
01:29:47,410 --> 01:29:48,190
Right.

3212
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:53,190
Let all nations rule internally resolving
external disputes in a world court.

3213
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:54,633
Okay.

3214
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:57,550
Avoid petty laws and useless officials.

3215
01:29:57,610 --> 01:29:58,750
Fuck yes.

3216
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,960
Balance personal rights
with social duties.

3217
01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:03,400
Absolutely.

3218
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,050
Prize truth,

3219
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:05,740
beauty.

3220
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:10,720
Love seeking harmony with
the infinite and 10 B,

3221
01:30:10,721 --> 01:30:12,640
not a cancer on the earth.

3222
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:14,440
Leave Room for nature.

3223
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:16,360
Leave Room for nature.

3224
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:18,790
The only thing that's repeated
twice in the entire thing.

3225
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:20,963
Hello.

3226
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:22,180
It's not bad idea.

3227
01:30:22,181 --> 01:30:22,840
I mean,

3228
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:23,290
listen,

3229
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:24,340
you're gonna need a lot more than that.

3230
01:30:24,341 --> 01:30:24,431
It's,

3231
01:30:24,431 --> 01:30:25,630
you're on a run a fucking world.

3232
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:27,490
But they're not bad.

3233
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:29,230
There's only a couple of
them that are kind of goofy.

3234
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:32,680
There's nothing in there about how to
lay fiber optic cables across the fucking

3235
01:30:32,681 --> 01:30:33,514
Oh yeah.

3236
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:34,400
Help us out here.

3237
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,530
Georgia stone thing.

3238
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:37,750
Where's the Georgia stem thing at?

3239
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:39,560
It's good.

3240
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,090
It's Georgia,

3241
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:40,923
I would assume.

3242
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:41,900
So.

3243
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:42,733
Let's find out,

3244
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:44,600
uh,

3245
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,560
Elbert County,

3246
01:30:45,561 --> 01:30:46,394
Georgia,

3247
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:46,791
uh,

3248
01:30:46,791 --> 01:30:47,570
message.

3249
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:52,220
Clearly conveying a set of 10 guidelines
as inscribed on the structure in eight

3250
01:30:52,221 --> 01:30:55,880
modern languages and he's shorter
message is inscribed at the top of the

3251
01:30:55,881 --> 01:30:57,890
structure in for ancient languages.

3252
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,360
Babylonian,

3253
01:30:59,361 --> 01:30:59,931
classical,

3254
01:30:59,931 --> 01:31:00,410
Greek,

3255
01:31:00,410 --> 01:31:02,840
Sanskrit and Egyptian hieroglyphs.

3256
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:03,680
Wow.

3257
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:06,530
The structure is sometimes
referred to as American Stonehenge.

3258
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:10,400
Monument is 19 feet three inches tall,

3259
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:15,580
made from six granite slabs
weighing 237,746 pounds.

3260
01:31:15,831 --> 01:31:16,640
Why am I reading this?

3261
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:17,473
Nobody cares.

3262
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,940
Calves telling lies at
the top of the five slabs,

3263
01:31:19,941 --> 01:31:24,080
which are astronomically aligned
and additional stone tablet,

3264
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:27,200
which is set on the ground short
distance to the west of the structure,

3265
01:31:27,201 --> 01:31:30,230
provide some notes in the history
and the purpose of the Guidestones.

3266
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:36,270
June of 1979 and unknown person or
persons under the pseudonym RC Christian

3267
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:40,850
hired Elberton granite finishing
company to build a structure.

3268
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:42,910
Wow.

3269
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:47,910
In 2008 the stones were defaced with
polyurethane paint death to the new world

3270
01:31:48,851 --> 01:31:49,061
order,

3271
01:31:49,061 --> 01:31:50,260
like all that shit that we saw.

3272
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:52,950
Wired magazine called the defacement,

3273
01:31:52,951 --> 01:31:55,920
the first serious act of vandalism
in the Guidestones history.

3274
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:57,870
I wonder if they cleaned that up.

3275
01:31:59,570 --> 01:31:59,830
Did they?

3276
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:00,000
Can

3277
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,880
they clean that shit up?

3278
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:01,610
Scrape it?

3279
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:02,440
Yeah.

3280
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,480
I mean you could still slightly see it,

3281
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:04,990
but,

3282
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:05,201
oh,

3283
01:32:05,201 --> 01:32:06,040
that's so annoying.

3284
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:06,993
It's annoying.

3285
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,320
Death to the new world order.

3286
01:32:08,321 --> 01:32:09,460
Jesus Christ.

3287
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:11,020
Some fucking kids.

3288
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:12,910
Kids are crazy people.

3289
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:14,770
Death to the new world order.

3290
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:15,903
You know?

3291
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:16,871
Imagine if they said,

3292
01:32:16,871 --> 01:32:17,704
okay listen man,

3293
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:20,980
we're going to give you a button
that kills the new world order.

3294
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:22,210
Okay,

3295
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:23,920
but before you hit that button,

3296
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:26,310
can you at least identify
who you're killing?

3297
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:27,290
Yeah,

3298
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:28,440
I mean it's death.

3299
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:29,141
The new world order.

3300
01:32:29,141 --> 01:32:30,250
What's the new world order?

3301
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:33,490
Is it the banks or is it the politicians?

3302
01:32:33,491 --> 01:32:34,300
Is it everybody?

3303
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:34,451
Yeah,

3304
01:32:34,451 --> 01:32:35,350
it's really vague.

3305
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:35,801
Right,

3306
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:36,850
and if you killed them,

3307
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:38,410
what happens to everything?

3308
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:41,140
Because if you go totally
deaths in new world order,

3309
01:32:41,141 --> 01:32:41,974
what are you going to,

3310
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:43,360
are you going to run the banks?

3311
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,530
Who's gonna run the back?

3312
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:45,640
Is there a bank now?

3313
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,290
Like how do I get credit?

3314
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:48,820
What it,

3315
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:50,020
how do I use my credit card?

3316
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:50,501
Yeah.

3317
01:32:50,501 --> 01:32:52,720
You can't just like hit the
button and then be like,

3318
01:32:52,721 --> 01:32:55,260
I'm going to go get something to eat
now because like your credit card won't

3319
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:57,340
work like it's over.

3320
01:32:57,430 --> 01:32:58,330
It's over dude.

3321
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:59,261
You gotta be careful.

3322
01:32:59,261 --> 01:33:03,130
You can't death to the new world order
maybe enslaved them and force them to

3323
01:33:03,131 --> 01:33:05,980
work for us and slave the new world
order of forced him to work for us to fix

3324
01:33:05,981 --> 01:33:06,970
this problem that they created.

3325
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:07,661
Okay.

3326
01:33:07,661 --> 01:33:08,494
I'll be with you.

3327
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:09,830
Get Down with you on the end.

3328
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:14,320
You can't get to the new world or at
least can I just tell us how this thing is

3329
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:14,950
running,

3330
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:15,340
you know?

3331
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,330
Right before he killed him,

3332
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:22,050
I'd start with like accountability for
the new world or like explain yourselves.

3333
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:23,120
Yeah,

3334
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:23,420
we meet.

3335
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:26,530
Why would you ride down on the
Georgia Guidestones silly fuck.

3336
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:28,180
The Georgia Guidestones are fascinating.

3337
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:29,430
I think it's interesting to me.

3338
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:32,710
I don't know who the dude is
or unknown dudes or dudettes.

3339
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:33,431
Yeah.

3340
01:33:33,431 --> 01:33:36,220
Especially since they commissioned
like a place to do it.

3341
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:36,680
Yeah.

3342
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,980
I like to don't tell anyone we were here.

3343
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,240
Well you can rock it that way.

3344
01:33:40,241 --> 01:33:41,500
In 1979 though,

3345
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:42,310
you know,

3346
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:45,520
1979 like no DNA.

3347
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:46,770
There was no credit cards.

3348
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:47,620
There was no nothing.

3349
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,720
A paper receipt with a carbon coffee.

3350
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:50,290
Yeah.

3351
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:50,801
Gave you that was,

3352
01:33:50,801 --> 01:33:51,760
that was the only record.

3353
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,361
Yeah.

3354
01:33:52,361 --> 01:33:56,740
People used to buy groceries
with checks all the time.

3355
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:59,920
You would like see women at the cash
register and you know they would be

3356
01:33:59,921 --> 01:34:00,251
reading.

3357
01:34:00,251 --> 01:34:00,500
Okay.

3358
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,280
Was that they would pay with a check.

3359
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:04,930
Like that was super common.

3360
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:08,650
Now it's rare when I see someone paying
with a check I get kind of excited.

3361
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:09,340
Really?

3362
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:09,641
Yeah.

3363
01:34:09,641 --> 01:34:10,900
Like it's like a legacy thing.

3364
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:11,710
Like whoa.

3365
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:11,810
Yeah,

3366
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:12,970
I can see that much longer.

3367
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:15,110
It's kind of cool to,

3368
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,690
it's always old people.

3369
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:17,583
Yeah.

3370
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:18,011
Oh yeah.

3371
01:34:18,011 --> 01:34:19,540
Or you know there's some housewives,

3372
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:20,620
you know,

3373
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:21,311
sometimes people,

3374
01:34:21,311 --> 01:34:23,380
they like to balance
their checkbook like that.

3375
01:34:23,381 --> 01:34:26,410
That's how they make sure that they
keep an accurate assessment of what's in

3376
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:27,244
there.

3377
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:29,180
But now you can bounce a check
book like looking at you,

3378
01:34:29,181 --> 01:34:30,430
you look it up online,

3379
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:31,121
not balanced it,

3380
01:34:31,121 --> 01:34:33,340
but at least be aware you
could do it pretty easily.

3381
01:34:33,341 --> 01:34:34,420
Find out what your balances.

3382
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:37,180
The craziest thing is
you can send a check on,

3383
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:41,920
you can take a picture of a check and
send it over the Internet at deposit it

3384
01:34:41,921 --> 01:34:42,880
and using the phone.

3385
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:46,850
Well how about all these businesses now
that have these phone apps that you,

3386
01:34:46,851 --> 01:34:48,340
you put a thing on your phone,

3387
01:34:48,341 --> 01:34:52,330
you just swipe a credit card and you can
pay for a credit card with your phone.

3388
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:53,110
Yeah,

3389
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:53,291
they,

3390
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:56,410
a lot of businesses have those things
now I square it was like the big one,

3391
01:34:56,411 --> 01:34:56,650
right?

3392
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:57,220
Yeah.

3393
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:59,120
That that changes like merge on the,

3394
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:00,171
you can go,

3395
01:35:00,171 --> 01:35:02,060
oh I know except credit
cards and my iPhone.

3396
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:03,410
Do you have one of those?

3397
01:35:03,411 --> 01:35:04,910
Cause you have an LLC right?

3398
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:05,721
For desk squad.

3399
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:07,190
So you have one of those
you put on your phone?

3400
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:09,270
Yeah,

3401
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:11,730
I have one for like shows and
Shit when you sell tee shirt.

3402
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:13,340
I've never had really done that dude.

3403
01:35:13,341 --> 01:35:14,270
Why are you not doing that?

3404
01:35:14,271 --> 01:35:15,200
That sounds perfect.

3405
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:16,100
Yeah,

3406
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:17,270
that sounds cool as fuck.

3407
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:18,020
You know,

3408
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:20,910
so independent I cam home business.

3409
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:21,361
Yeah.

3410
01:35:21,361 --> 01:35:22,790
This I would wait,

3411
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:23,990
are you saying there's a problem?

3412
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:26,450
Do you not do it because
there's like some issue now.

3413
01:35:26,451 --> 01:35:28,130
I just did it just uh,

3414
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:28,993
you know,

3415
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,680
if you're selling a $10 poster,

3416
01:35:30,681 --> 01:35:31,910
you usually people who have $10,

3417
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:32,181
you know,

3418
01:35:32,181 --> 01:35:32,760
so it's,

3419
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:35,880
it's not necessary but I,

3420
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:36,783
if

3421
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:38,953
I

3422
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:43,460
brought we fucking next subject,

3423
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:45,423
next Trump.

3424
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:47,121
But no,

3425
01:35:47,121 --> 01:35:47,870
it works good.

3426
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:50,990
I mean my weed dealer sells it easy bro.

3427
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:53,750
Him under the bus to speed week.

3428
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,580
You throw him under the bus.

3429
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:56,421
No,

3430
01:35:56,421 --> 01:35:56,871
it's cool.

3431
01:35:56,871 --> 01:35:57,640
I'd like every,

3432
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:57,931
you know,

3433
01:35:57,931 --> 01:36:00,580
like a lot of small
businesses like smaller,

3434
01:36:00,581 --> 01:36:03,890
like mom and pop stores use that now
instead of having the big credit card

3435
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:06,770
machine that they just have like an
iPad sitting there that you just sign.

3436
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:07,791
Yeah,

3437
01:36:07,791 --> 01:36:08,600
it makes sense.

3438
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:11,630
I went to a coffee place recently that a,

3439
01:36:11,631 --> 01:36:15,350
you swipe your credit card and
then you write on the screen.

3440
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:15,820
Right.

3441
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:16,040
You know,

3442
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:16,350
you're right.

3443
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:17,090
You're saying the screen.

3444
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:22,090
What's really crazy is that like there's
like these little tablets and it's all

3445
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:25,520
this really complicated screen,

3446
01:36:25,521 --> 01:36:27,320
high definition touch screen,

3447
01:36:27,321 --> 01:36:28,250
super accurate,

3448
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:31,160
but you're still like doing
this thing with your fucking,

3449
01:36:31,190 --> 01:36:32,390
you're putting your mark.

3450
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:34,790
That's how you prove it's you.

3451
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:36,230
That's so goofy,

3452
01:36:36,530 --> 01:36:37,210
goofy.

3453
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:41,030
It's just weird that that's still the
way we do it and it doesn't even matter

3454
01:36:41,031 --> 01:36:41,511
anymore.

3455
01:36:41,511 --> 01:36:42,321
Like you don't,

3456
01:36:42,321 --> 01:36:43,820
there's no need to go through that.

3457
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:45,350
I did once.

3458
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:47,920
I was cause I was looking at
one of these signs and things.

3459
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:49,310
I'm like this no way it matters.

3460
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:54,370
And I wrote in the signature box matter
stolen card and I hit submit and I

3461
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:56,374
totally,

3462
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:57,920
yeah,

3463
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:02,420
it's just they want to get a record
of you making a mark on that paper.

3464
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,890
You're making a mark on that screen.

3465
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:05,630
What do you think will happen?

3466
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:06,380
Because there's,

3467
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:10,250
they're going to stop teaching cursive
in school and they're already starting to

3468
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:10,760
thank God.

3469
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:12,500
What's going to happen with signatures?

3470
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:14,540
That's good question.

3471
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:16,160
That's a very good question.

3472
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:16,281
Well,

3473
01:37:16,281 --> 01:37:16,851
what are we going to,

3474
01:37:16,851 --> 01:37:18,740
how are we going to sign things?

3475
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:22,100
Like if you never learn cursive,

3476
01:37:22,101 --> 01:37:24,050
what are we going to all have like codes.

3477
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:27,890
Do you think that the idea of signing
things is ridiculous and isn't it kind of

3478
01:37:27,891 --> 01:37:28,490
ridiculous?

3479
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:31,130
The idea of signing things like you shed

3480
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:36,800
the idea that you're
bound to an agreement,

3481
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:40,160
these wavy lines that you put on paper.

3482
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:44,720
There's certain things that I
think like business dealings,

3483
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:48,170
like say if you and I decided
to build a house together,

3484
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:52,100
like nick and Joe go into construction
business and we decided to build and we

3485
01:37:52,101 --> 01:37:54,980
have a business and the
businesses 50 50 and you,

3486
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:58,950
we pay for the same amount for this
and that and we get the same amount of

3487
01:37:58,951 --> 01:38:00,630
profit and you got that all worked out.

3488
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,700
That kind of makes sense to do that.

3489
01:38:02,701 --> 01:38:07,350
But there's a lot of things that you
signed for like cable agreements,

3490
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:08,191
you know,

3491
01:38:08,191 --> 01:38:12,390
or cell phone contracts or
there's literally entanglements,

3492
01:38:12,391 --> 01:38:13,560
business entanglements.

3493
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:16,530
There's a contract to get a cell phone.

3494
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:19,710
Have I have to have a
contract like what is this?

3495
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:20,190
When I'm,

3496
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:21,300
what am I agreeing to?

3497
01:38:21,370 --> 01:38:22,500
I'm agreeing to what is,

3498
01:38:22,501 --> 01:38:23,520
this is ridiculous.

3499
01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:25,000
There's a whole documentary,

3500
01:38:25,001 --> 01:38:30,001
I watched a Netflix about
terms and conditions and
all the things that you sign

3501
01:38:30,761 --> 01:38:32,120
away the second you.

3502
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:32,980
Yeah.

3503
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:34,270
Who fucking reads that shit?

3504
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:34,811
Nobody.

3505
01:38:34,811 --> 01:38:38,620
And that's why they get away with
putting all kinds of insane shit.

3506
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:39,970
And what's the documentary called?

3507
01:38:40,030 --> 01:38:41,610
It's called like we're fucked or

3508
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:45,070
really terrible.

3509
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:47,860
I think it's called like
terms and conditions,

3510
01:38:47,861 --> 01:38:48,431
terms and sending.

3511
01:38:48,431 --> 01:38:48,731
It's on,

3512
01:38:48,731 --> 01:38:50,940
it's on Netflix and it's,

3513
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:54,160
it's pretty interesting that they go
through all the different companies and

3514
01:38:54,161 --> 01:38:54,670
like,

3515
01:38:54,670 --> 01:38:55,503
uh,

3516
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:56,380
which ones like,

3517
01:38:56,381 --> 01:39:00,490
well we'll sell your personal information
because you've agreed that the second

3518
01:39:00,491 --> 01:39:05,170
you hit click yes on iTunes or like you
agreed to apples the second you turn on

3519
01:39:05,171 --> 01:39:06,460
your iPhone or something like that,

3520
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:09,130
they can store your information,

3521
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:11,620
they can sell it if the
government needs it.

3522
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:13,120
They used to be like,

3523
01:39:13,121 --> 01:39:14,710
we will not give out your information.

3524
01:39:14,711 --> 01:39:16,780
And then they've changed
the clause to like,

3525
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:17,320
you know,

3526
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:18,560
unless like it,

3527
01:39:18,561 --> 01:39:19,420
it'll be words like,

3528
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:24,630
unless certain things come up the fuck
does that mean he just be anything less

3529
01:39:25,241 --> 01:39:26,074
certain things.

3530
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:30,310
They're so vague about it
unless like shit goes down,

3531
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:30,611
you're like,

3532
01:39:30,611 --> 01:39:31,600
you can't say that.

3533
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:32,260
It's just,

3534
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:32,740
what is that?

3535
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:34,090
That South Park Episode,

3536
01:39:34,091 --> 01:39:37,930
Human Sin and pad where it's all about
Apple's terminus and conditions ends up

3537
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:41,050
having like you signed this guy's ass

3538
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:48,460
south park's the best.

3539
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,140
That's so great.

3540
01:39:50,690 --> 01:39:50,890
Yeah,

3541
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:51,860
and nobody reads it.

3542
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:52,883
I would like,

3543
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:56,000
I would love to know what the actual
numbers of people who read the terms and

3544
01:39:56,001 --> 01:39:57,350
conditions before they click on it.

3545
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:01,220
It's going to be half a percent if that.

3546
01:40:01,221 --> 01:40:02,054
Right.

3547
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:03,740
That means so much.

3548
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:08,660
That means half a percent is
one person out of 200 right?

3549
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:09,583
Isn't that what it means?

3550
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:10,400
I think,

3551
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,000
well,

3552
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:11,241
yeah,

3553
01:40:11,241 --> 01:40:11,660
right?

3554
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:12,110
Yeah.

3555
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:12,590
Yeah.

3556
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:12,771
Yeah.

3557
01:40:12,771 --> 01:40:17,200
1% would be one out of 100 so half a
percent is 1% of 200 does that make sense?

3558
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:18,930
So I don't,

3559
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:19,970
I don't believe that.

3560
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:21,260
Does he think it's even less?

3561
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:22,903
Yeah.

3562
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:24,200
I think it's probably

3563
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:27,500
not even,

3564
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:32,500
not 1% but like one 10th of 1% I bet
it's one out of a thousand that's what I

3565
01:40:33,651 --> 01:40:34,484
bet.

3566
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:34,911
Yeah,

3567
01:40:34,911 --> 01:40:35,840
that makes more sense.

3568
01:40:36,650 --> 01:40:39,860
One out of a thousand actually
reads the whole thing and he goes,

3569
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:40,340
well,

3570
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:41,600
I want to click on this.

3571
01:40:41,630 --> 01:40:42,463
Let me see.

3572
01:40:42,590 --> 01:40:42,891
Yeah,

3573
01:40:42,891 --> 01:40:46,840
it sounds reading glasses as fucking God
damn liberal president we have here and

3574
01:40:46,841 --> 01:40:48,310
trying to calm me and asmark countries.

3575
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:48,900
Yeah.

3576
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:49,100
Yeah.

3577
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:50,030
That guy will read it

3578
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:51,270
and they tell that

3579
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:53,980
they tell you in

3580
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:58,270
the documentary if you spent all the
time reading every time like a new terms

3581
01:40:58,271 --> 01:41:01,730
and conditions comes up for
all the different things
that make you sign when it

3582
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:06,070
[inaudible] it would take like years of
your life you have to take like days off

3583
01:41:06,071 --> 01:41:08,440
of work to be like dude I
just sign up for Netflix,

3584
01:41:08,441 --> 01:41:10,270
Spotify and I got a new iPhone.

3585
01:41:10,271 --> 01:41:14,770
So like I can't come into work today
because I have to read like 860 pages of

3586
01:41:14,771 --> 01:41:15,670
legal jargon.

3587
01:41:16,110 --> 01:41:16,441
Yeah.

3588
01:41:16,441 --> 01:41:18,300
It should be at a certain point in time.

3589
01:41:18,301 --> 01:41:21,870
It should be that your method of delivery
is so woefully ineffective that it's

3590
01:41:21,871 --> 01:41:22,620
illegal.

3591
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:24,510
Like a terms and conditions on that scale.

3592
01:41:24,511 --> 01:41:29,511
If I could prove that my
theory was correct and then
it's like one half of 1% or

3593
01:41:29,701 --> 01:41:33,180
one 10th of 1% rather that
that actually read that thing,

3594
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:34,313
they'll should be illegal.

3595
01:41:34,510 --> 01:41:34,670
Yeah.

3596
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:36,810
Cause you're making people sign
things and they're just not reading,

3597
01:41:36,811 --> 01:41:37,111
you know,

3598
01:41:37,111 --> 01:41:37,921
they're not reading it.

3599
01:41:37,921 --> 01:41:38,754
Yeah.

3600
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:39,720
You're like misleading.

3601
01:41:39,721 --> 01:41:41,730
You're intentionally
making it more difficult.

3602
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:46,940
They make everything so rock solid in
their favor and even things that like just

3603
01:41:47,581 --> 01:41:48,810
shouldn't be that way.

3604
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:54,140
There's certain agreements like when
you find out that anytime you cancel,

3605
01:41:55,051 --> 01:41:55,884
anytime you,

3606
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:56,370
you know,

3607
01:41:56,370 --> 01:41:57,540
you want to change this,

3608
01:41:57,541 --> 01:41:58,770
you're subject to fees,

3609
01:41:58,771 --> 01:42:01,800
you're subject to that and you'll
let you find out things about your

3610
01:42:01,801 --> 01:42:02,431
information,

3611
01:42:02,431 --> 01:42:03,120
your history,

3612
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:05,160
they're selling your phone
number or your email.

3613
01:42:05,161 --> 01:42:09,480
And there's so many things that happen
to people when you sign those little

3614
01:42:09,481 --> 01:42:10,314
things away.

3615
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:12,810
But we do it recklessly.

3616
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:13,710
Yeah.

3617
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:14,790
I don't ever think about it.

3618
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,341
Have you ever had a,

3619
01:42:16,341 --> 01:42:17,970
an app that you click the yes.

3620
01:42:17,971 --> 01:42:19,410
On then it started making tweaks for you?

3621
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:19,991
Yeah,

3622
01:42:19,991 --> 01:42:20,530
there's there,

3623
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:21,730
especially on Android,

3624
01:42:21,731 --> 01:42:26,110
there's a lot of sketchy things that
like a year installing so they can also

3625
01:42:26,111 --> 01:42:27,440
track you like any,

3626
01:42:27,450 --> 01:42:27,670
they,

3627
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:29,410
whoever made this app and track you.

3628
01:42:29,450 --> 01:42:30,130
It's weird.

3629
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:30,640
Yeah.

3630
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:31,660
I had a guy,

3631
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:32,320
um,

3632
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,610
he made some app,

3633
01:42:34,010 --> 01:42:34,490
uh,

3634
01:42:34,490 --> 01:42:39,490
that tweeted for me something about
like a how do a prize for an Ipad,

3635
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:40,720
you know,

3636
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,020
and a,

3637
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:41,741
and someone said,

3638
01:42:41,741 --> 01:42:41,990
dude,

3639
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:43,030
you hawk an iPad.

3640
01:42:43,031 --> 01:42:43,331
And I was like,

3641
01:42:43,331 --> 01:42:43,880
what are you talking about?

3642
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:44,681
And then I went to my thing,

3643
01:42:44,681 --> 01:42:44,891
I was like,

3644
01:42:44,891 --> 01:42:46,180
what the fuck is this?

3645
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:48,340
And then I found out where
it was from this guy,

3646
01:42:48,430 --> 01:42:52,750
I guess I had like retweeted
something from a website.

3647
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:55,240
Like sometimes when you retweet something,

3648
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:59,350
like if you go to a website and you
click on it a story or something that you

3649
01:42:59,351 --> 01:43:00,880
think is interesting and you,

3650
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:04,750
there's like a tweet button but if you
tweet it like sometimes you were agreeing

3651
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:08,980
to allow them to have access
to your Twitter account or
at least used to be that

3652
01:43:08,981 --> 01:43:09,450
way.

3653
01:43:09,450 --> 01:43:09,661
Well,

3654
01:43:09,661 --> 01:43:10,441
a lot of those websites,

3655
01:43:10,441 --> 01:43:11,040
that's how you,

3656
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:14,370
they steal your credit or your a password
asa because you go in and order to

3657
01:43:14,371 --> 01:43:18,060
complete like tweet this story and this
is like you need to log in and what it's

3658
01:43:18,061 --> 01:43:18,331
doing,

3659
01:43:18,331 --> 01:43:22,500
it's actually stealing your password
and logging you in at the same time.

3660
01:43:22,501 --> 01:43:24,240
So it looks like everything's going right.

3661
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:27,720
And then that's how a lot of
people will get fished for there.

3662
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:28,713
Yeah,

3663
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,100
I could only imagine,

3664
01:43:30,490 --> 01:43:31,323
but uh,

3665
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,390
there's dude's somehow or another,

3666
01:43:32,391 --> 01:43:34,390
it had like an APP
installed on my Twitter.

3667
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:35,470
It was like,

3668
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:36,040
you know those,

3669
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:37,900
those things that are
attached to your Twitter,

3670
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:38,201
you know,

3671
01:43:38,201 --> 01:43:40,840
there's like Evernote and you can tweet
with Evernote and there's a bunch of

3672
01:43:40,841 --> 01:43:41,674
different ones.

3673
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:43,970
This guy had like this
installed on my computer.

3674
01:43:43,971 --> 01:43:44,171
I was like,

3675
01:43:44,171 --> 01:43:45,004
what the fuck?

3676
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:46,120
So I go to his website,

3677
01:43:46,121 --> 01:43:46,781
his website is like,

3678
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:47,380
um,

3679
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:52,070
you know it his Twitter page or like
a hundred thousand fucking friends or

3680
01:43:52,071 --> 01:43:52,581
whatever it is.

3681
01:43:52,581 --> 01:43:53,414
Followers.

3682
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:54,950
Like how's he doing that?

3683
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,590
Like just scams all around.

3684
01:43:58,370 --> 01:43:59,700
You automatically add them?

3685
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:00,270
Probably,

3686
01:44:00,270 --> 01:44:00,670
yeah,

3687
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:04,190
I do a search to find out what like
what kind of traffic is websites getting

3688
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:07,370
ridiculous traffic cause this is
all this weasel work going on,

3689
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:08,180
you know,

3690
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:11,630
sneaky people that forced you into
clicking on things are tricky and the

3691
01:44:11,631 --> 01:44:12,370
clicking on things,

3692
01:44:12,370 --> 01:44:12,951
next thing you know,

3693
01:44:12,951 --> 01:44:16,580
they're tweeting about iPad
giveaways from your account.

3694
01:44:16,581 --> 01:44:16,881
You're like,

3695
01:44:16,881 --> 01:44:17,714
what?

3696
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:19,670
And then you find out that that's legal.

3697
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:20,271
Yeah.

3698
01:44:20,271 --> 01:44:20,631
You,

3699
01:44:20,631 --> 01:44:20,911
you,

3700
01:44:20,911 --> 01:44:24,050
you actually clicked on a thing
that says you're allowed to do that.

3701
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:26,641
Yeah.

3702
01:44:26,641 --> 01:44:27,474
It's bizarre.

3703
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:32,400
Like if after watching that documentary
made me want to like just not sign up

3704
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:33,930
for a lot of websites when I'm like,

3705
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:35,100
do I really want that?

3706
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:36,181
Do I need that?

3707
01:44:36,181 --> 01:44:38,010
Because I'm not going to read
the terms and conditions.

3708
01:44:38,170 --> 01:44:38,860
Yeah.

3709
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:41,890
Hello Brian Denning sentenced
to 15 months in prison.

3710
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:43,360
Who is that?

3711
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:44,193
Ooh,

3712
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:45,723
remember Brian?

3713
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:47,621
Yeah,

3714
01:44:47,621 --> 01:44:48,970
Brian Dunning was the guy.

3715
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:54,030
I had him on my podcast and we had a very
contentious discussion I sad to hear.

3716
01:44:56,710 --> 01:44:57,970
And He um,

3717
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:00,311
he had a,

3718
01:45:00,311 --> 01:45:01,144
um,

3719
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:02,740
an issue with,

3720
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:04,150
believe it was Amazon,

3721
01:45:04,151 --> 01:45:04,984
right?

3722
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:06,023
Bang.

3723
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:06,450
Yeah.

3724
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:08,290
And he had created some sort of an APP.

3725
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:10,440
And if you use the APP it,

3726
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:13,240
it puts a cookie on your,

3727
01:45:13,241 --> 01:45:14,074
uh,

3728
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:15,180
on your,

3729
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:15,791
on your computer.

3730
01:45:15,791 --> 01:45:16,630
Like if you use it,

3731
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:18,550
it puts a cookie on your computer.

3732
01:45:18,551 --> 01:45:22,720
And then anytime you go to Ebay
and make a purchase or do business,

3733
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:24,340
he would get like a kickback.

3734
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:29,020
And the way he described the way
described it is very different.

3735
01:45:29,021 --> 01:45:30,310
So I don't know who's
right or who's wrong,

3736
01:45:30,610 --> 01:45:35,610
but what they're accusing him
of is you plant something on,

3737
01:45:35,801 --> 01:45:36,720
you're like a plant,

3738
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:37,150
a cookie.

3739
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:40,060
And then even if you don't go
to Ebay through his website,

3740
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:41,200
it appears that you did.

3741
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:46,300
So they have like these ebay affiliates
where say like if nick use of.com if I

3742
01:45:46,301 --> 01:45:48,970
went through that and then went
to Ebay and purchase something,

3743
01:45:49,090 --> 01:45:51,070
you would get like a little
tiny piece of the action.

3744
01:45:51,071 --> 01:45:52,420
And over time that counts.

3745
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:53,380
That counts for a lot.

3746
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:56,110
And because these apps were
popular account for a lot,

3747
01:45:56,111 --> 01:45:57,010
and he made a lot of money,

3748
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:58,330
5 million.

3749
01:45:58,540 --> 01:45:59,130
Whoa.

3750
01:45:59,130 --> 01:45:59,320
Yeah.

3751
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:01,570
He made $5 million off
the APP and then they,

3752
01:46:01,571 --> 01:46:02,040
uh,

3753
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:04,720
they shut it down and arrested him.

3754
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,450
And when we had them on the podcast,

3755
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:09,430
I do not think he's a bad guy,

3756
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:11,470
but there's something wrong
with the way he thinks.

3757
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:14,890
And what would I say
that I say that with all,

3758
01:46:15,610 --> 01:46:17,590
all respect and dignity,

3759
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:19,113
um,

3760
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:21,670
communicating about a fellow human being,

3761
01:46:21,671 --> 01:46:22,750
like I don't hate that guy.

3762
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:23,771
He's silly.

3763
01:46:23,771 --> 01:46:25,570
And he said a bunch of
crazy shit about me.

3764
01:46:26,110 --> 01:46:26,560
Um,

3765
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,420
but I think he's,

3766
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:31,070
I think there's something wrong
with the way he thinks I'm thinking.

3767
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:33,580
And I even communicated with
him about that in private.

3768
01:46:33,581 --> 01:46:37,000
We had like a little email conversation
and he actually asked me about

3769
01:46:37,001 --> 01:46:41,320
psychedelic drugs and he's curious
about the mind expanding aspects.

3770
01:46:41,321 --> 01:46:42,280
And we had a,

3771
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:44,920
we had a pretty intense
conversation about it.

3772
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:46,090
Um,

3773
01:46:46,090 --> 01:46:47,470
because I think,

3774
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:48,020
and I,

3775
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:48,701
and I told him that,

3776
01:46:48,701 --> 01:46:49,590
I said with due respect,

3777
01:46:49,591 --> 01:46:51,120
I think there's something
wrong with the way you think.

3778
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:51,420
Like,

3779
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:52,201
I don't know what it is,

3780
01:46:52,201 --> 01:46:53,550
but I think it's like a mental illness.

3781
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:54,661
His,

3782
01:46:54,661 --> 01:46:58,200
his versions of reality and
reality itself are so twisted.

3783
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:03,380
Like there was a video that we watched
of tower seven from September 11th

3784
01:47:03,391 --> 01:47:08,391
falling and he was trying to convince us
that it doesn't collapse into its base.

3785
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:12,690
He was trying to convince us that
only three quarters of the tower,

3786
01:47:12,691 --> 01:47:14,220
the three quarters of the
tower is still standing.

3787
01:47:14,221 --> 01:47:16,350
It was only the top
quarter or whatever it was.

3788
01:47:16,351 --> 01:47:17,850
He had some weird numbers
in his head and I'm like,

3789
01:47:17,851 --> 01:47:22,620
what are you talking about that that
thing gives out and falls into a pile.

3790
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:26,520
Like the reason why it's so high is
because that's how much shit there is.

3791
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:27,830
The whole thing's gone.

3792
01:47:28,010 --> 01:47:29,440
Like the building disintegrate.

3793
01:47:29,450 --> 01:47:30,310
It's not a cartoon.

3794
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:31,650
I'll just vanishes.

3795
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:31,950
Yeah,

3796
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:32,670
it's all on top.

3797
01:47:32,670 --> 01:47:32,851
Yeah,

3798
01:47:32,851 --> 01:47:33,301
exactly.

3799
01:47:33,301 --> 01:47:34,320
It's on for rent signs,

3800
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:35,580
stack of Shit.

3801
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:38,550
The reason why the stack is so high is
because there was a lot of shit above it.

3802
01:47:38,551 --> 01:47:40,800
It felt like this is retarded like this,

3803
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:44,400
but he wouldn't let it go and what I was
looking at him when he wouldn't let it

3804
01:47:44,401 --> 01:47:44,551
go.

3805
01:47:44,551 --> 01:47:44,850
It's like,

3806
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:44,971
oh,

3807
01:47:44,971 --> 01:47:46,410
there's something wrong in there.

3808
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:47,370
Like there's a,

3809
01:47:47,370 --> 01:47:48,570
there's a missing thing.

3810
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:50,790
And then when he started
talking about his life,

3811
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:53,610
it made way more sense
because he was raised a very,

3812
01:47:53,611 --> 01:47:55,770
very conservative Mormon,

3813
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:57,120
like his whole life.

3814
01:47:57,121 --> 01:47:59,760
He was very religious and he's,

3815
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:05,210
he's developed his mind developed under
this fundamentalist thinking that is

3816
01:48:05,821 --> 01:48:07,470
super damaging to people.

3817
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:12,120
And that sounds like an ignorant bigot
and an anti religious thing for me to

3818
01:48:12,121 --> 01:48:12,660
say.

3819
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:14,760
But just listen to this for a second.

3820
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:20,480
I have friends that grew up Mormon and
they to this day tell me that they're

3821
01:48:20,791 --> 01:48:21,680
really gullible.

3822
01:48:21,730 --> 01:48:22,650
They worry about it.

3823
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:23,873
They don't,

3824
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:28,980
they don't know whether or not someone
is trying to pull a fast one on them.

3825
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:34,100
They don't know whether or not like a
yoga guru or a cult member could rope them

3826
01:48:35,731 --> 01:48:38,850
in and suck them into things by
telling them that they found a seat.

3827
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:41,910
Like they have this weird need
to believe irrational things.

3828
01:48:41,911 --> 01:48:43,470
And this is when this
woman who tells me herself,

3829
01:48:43,471 --> 01:48:44,400
it disturbs her.

3830
01:48:44,820 --> 01:48:45,211
She's like,

3831
01:48:45,211 --> 01:48:46,500
I don't know what it is,

3832
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:48,950
but I have this weird like I'm,

3833
01:48:48,951 --> 01:48:50,910
I'm susceptible to trickery.

3834
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:51,571
And I was like,

3835
01:48:51,571 --> 01:48:52,261
whoa.

3836
01:48:52,261 --> 01:48:54,940
I thought it was a weird admission
and she was just talking.

3837
01:48:54,941 --> 01:48:55,291
She was like,

3838
01:48:55,291 --> 01:48:58,080
as I've gotten older and she's not dumb,

3839
01:48:58,200 --> 01:48:58,531
she's like,

3840
01:48:58,531 --> 01:49:00,810
as I've gotten older and I've
talked to my other friends,

3841
01:49:00,811 --> 01:49:01,081
I'm like,

3842
01:49:01,081 --> 01:49:02,940
well what is it about me and she's like,

3843
01:49:02,941 --> 01:49:07,941
because all my life I thought
that God had my back all my life.

3844
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,470
I thought that God has
everything covered in.

3845
01:49:10,471 --> 01:49:12,960
Everything's going to be fine
until over and over again.

3846
01:49:12,961 --> 01:49:13,441
Fucked up.

3847
01:49:13,441 --> 01:49:15,240
Things would happen to her
and she was forced to go wait,

3848
01:49:15,241 --> 01:49:16,350
what's going on here?

3849
01:49:16,670 --> 01:49:19,510
And then she would see the
ridiculous hypocrisy of the church.

3850
01:49:19,510 --> 01:49:23,010
She looked into the religion deeper
than got to be like your forties and is

3851
01:49:23,011 --> 01:49:24,030
looking at her life going,

3852
01:49:24,031 --> 01:49:25,590
fuck yeah,

3853
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:27,930
like what is this and why am I,

3854
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:28,793
why am I,

3855
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:30,420
that guy is like that.

3856
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:34,920
He grew up super religious when you
grew up super religious like that,

3857
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,290
especially if you don't
have open minded parents,

3858
01:49:37,291 --> 01:49:40,860
like there's a way I think that you could
grow up with a sense of spirituality

3859
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:45,030
and still be very open minded and
maybe scientifically inclined.

3860
01:49:45,031 --> 01:49:47,000
But the reason why this
guy is like such a,

3861
01:49:47,870 --> 01:49:51,880
these like going after things
like debunking things showing,

3862
01:49:51,881 --> 01:49:52,360
Huh,

3863
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:53,770
this is all nonsense.

3864
01:49:53,771 --> 01:49:54,610
Ladies and gentlemen,

3865
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:56,680
I give you ever seen
his video on fracking?

3866
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:58,450
Yeah.

3867
01:49:58,450 --> 01:49:59,283
Yeah.

3868
01:49:59,350 --> 01:50:04,350
That's the perfect example of there's
like a no nonsense voice that people use

3869
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:06,640
and it's like there's a tone.

3870
01:50:06,641 --> 01:50:11,200
This is like a very condescending
way of communicating their ideas.

3871
01:50:11,530 --> 01:50:13,510
It's the no nonsense guy.

3872
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:18,640
And there's a lot of things that are
misunderstood about hydraulic fracturing,

3873
01:50:18,850 --> 01:50:20,560
otherwise known as fracking.

3874
01:50:21,090 --> 01:50:22,330
You ever seen him pull that video up?

3875
01:50:22,331 --> 01:50:25,810
Cause this was back in the
day when I first saw it.

3876
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:27,400
What did you believe that fracking was?

3877
01:50:27,401 --> 01:50:28,210
Real?

3878
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:28,740
What do you mean?

3879
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:29,140
I mean,

3880
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:29,651
I'm tracking,

3881
01:50:29,651 --> 01:50:29,970
I'm sorry.

3882
01:50:29,970 --> 01:50:30,803
Nevermind.

3883
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:32,580
I believe they wouldn't though.

3884
01:50:32,730 --> 01:50:33,700
Fracking is totally real.

3885
01:50:33,701 --> 01:50:35,110
They make a lot of money off of fracking.

3886
01:50:35,111 --> 01:50:35,944
Son,

3887
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:36,731
what did you,

3888
01:50:36,731 --> 01:50:36,880
uh,

3889
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:37,750
what were you talking about?

3890
01:50:38,430 --> 01:50:41,140
This little things in the cameras?

3891
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:43,000
I was thinking of that things in the Cam.

3892
01:50:43,001 --> 01:50:44,140
Remember like the lines,

3893
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:46,090
oh you talking about like the,

3894
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:46,983
the rods.

3895
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:48,431
Oh yeah,

3896
01:50:48,431 --> 01:50:48,641
yeah.

3897
01:50:48,641 --> 01:50:49,750
No that's totally different.

3898
01:50:49,751 --> 01:50:50,584
That guy's mad at me.

3899
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:52,210
That rod guy,

3900
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:53,043
the right guy.

3901
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,390
They've clowned him on that.

3902
01:50:55,391 --> 01:50:56,590
A monster quest show.

3903
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:57,781
Do you know,

3904
01:50:57,781 --> 01:50:57,881
uh,

3905
01:50:57,881 --> 01:50:59,330
with the rods are there the,

3906
01:51:00,910 --> 01:51:04,960
there's a visual artifact that comes
when bugs fly across the screen,

3907
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:06,700
but bugs move really fast.

3908
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:08,350
And if you don't have a
super high speed camera,

3909
01:51:08,351 --> 01:51:09,520
I can't capture the bug.

3910
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:13,480
So it elongates the shape of the bug
because it's this little tiny thing moving

3911
01:51:13,481 --> 01:51:17,830
quickly and it looks like a translucent
tube that's moving through the air and

3912
01:51:17,831 --> 01:51:21,580
it's just a video artifact of video
cameras trying to capture high speed bugs.

3913
01:51:21,710 --> 01:51:23,580
And this guy made all these
documentaries about this,

3914
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,210
these things flying in the air man.

3915
01:51:25,390 --> 01:51:26,620
And you could only see him on camera.

3916
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,000
They moved too fast with the human eye,

3917
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:29,170
which doesn't make any sense.

3918
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:30,970
Cause if I can see them on the camera,

3919
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:31,833
like the video,

3920
01:51:31,870 --> 01:51:33,310
that's not too fast for the human eye.

3921
01:51:33,410 --> 01:51:33,650
Yeah.

3922
01:51:33,650 --> 01:51:33,941
Okay.

3923
01:51:33,941 --> 01:51:35,290
I'm seeing the video of it.

3924
01:51:35,310 --> 01:51:39,390
It's like this is actually slower
than the human eye can perceive you.

3925
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:40,870
The human eye sees shit.

3926
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:41,141
You know?

3927
01:51:41,141 --> 01:51:41,381
Like Hey,

3928
01:51:41,381 --> 01:51:42,214
what does that fucking him?

3929
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:43,073
Some shit flying flat.

3930
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:44,290
You would see it.

3931
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:45,460
This is so stupid.

3932
01:51:45,461 --> 01:51:46,510
Like if you could see to the video,

3933
01:51:46,511 --> 01:51:47,560
you would see it in real life.

3934
01:51:47,980 --> 01:51:48,880
It's so dumb.

3935
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:52,150
And he tried to run with a
conspiracy that he made documentary.

3936
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:54,340
Me and Eddie Bravo got stoned.

3937
01:51:54,341 --> 01:51:55,750
It's fucking watched it and were like,

3938
01:51:55,751 --> 01:51:56,081
dude,

3939
01:51:56,081 --> 01:51:56,500
there's,

3940
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:57,700
what do you think these rods are?

3941
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:02,170
We're so high were so ridiculous.

3942
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:02,680
We're go,

3943
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:03,700
we're using the arm man.

3944
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:05,320
It's crazy that you can't see them.

3945
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:05,861
I'm like,

3946
01:52:05,861 --> 01:52:07,000
that doesn't even make any sense,

3947
01:52:07,001 --> 01:52:07,510
man.

3948
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:08,530
It doesn't even make any sense.

3949
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:09,850
So you think they're everywhere.

3950
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:10,691
They're everywhere.

3951
01:52:10,691 --> 01:52:11,590
They're just moving so fast.

3952
01:52:11,591 --> 01:52:12,424
We can't see them.

3953
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:13,751
They're like,

3954
01:52:13,751 --> 01:52:14,561
that's so crazy.

3955
01:52:14,561 --> 01:52:16,060
Maybe we should put up a new us.

3956
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:17,440
We should put up a net
and try to catch him.

3957
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:17,680
Yo,

3958
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:18,341
there's so fast.

3959
01:52:18,341 --> 01:52:18,971
They see the net,

3960
01:52:18,971 --> 01:52:19,804
they're gone.

3961
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:20,471
You're right,

3962
01:52:20,471 --> 01:52:20,831
you're right.

3963
01:52:20,831 --> 01:52:21,664
You're right.

3964
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:22,331
Otherwise,

3965
01:52:22,331 --> 01:52:24,340
like they would slam into planes and shit.

3966
01:52:24,341 --> 01:52:25,630
They get killing them off of planes.

3967
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:26,141
Here it is.

3968
01:52:26,141 --> 01:52:28,630
Listen to Brian talk about
hydraulic fracturing.

3969
01:52:29,690 --> 01:52:34,010
Then sand is mixed with the water and
gets distributed throughout the cracks to

3970
01:52:34,011 --> 01:52:34,850
prop them open.

3971
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:39,650
The water is then pumped back out and
now the gas can freely float to the

3972
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:40,493
borehole.

3973
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:45,500
The controversy comes mainly from the
fact that about one half of one of the

3974
01:52:45,501 --> 01:52:46,250
fluid

3975
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,620
consists of lubricants and surfactants.

3976
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:53,210
We needed to get the controversy comes
to the fact that people can't drink their

3977
01:52:53,211 --> 01:52:53,961
water anymore.

3978
01:52:53,961 --> 01:52:54,794
Man.

3979
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:57,310
This hydraulic fracturing like this,

3980
01:52:57,380 --> 01:53:01,160
that's one of those things that you bring
up in a conversation on podcasts and

3981
01:53:01,161 --> 01:53:02,900
people go fucking bananas.

3982
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:04,640
It's a global warming type issue.

3983
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:05,110
Really?

3984
01:53:05,110 --> 01:53:05,201
Yeah.

3985
01:53:05,201 --> 01:53:05,870
You know,

3986
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:06,710
global warming.

3987
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:09,470
If you believe in global warming or if
you don't believe in global warming,

3988
01:53:09,471 --> 01:53:12,650
you're gonna piss somebody off and then
getting get heated tweets about it.

3989
01:53:12,651 --> 01:53:14,720
People get fucking
furious because it's an,

3990
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:20,420
it's an ideology argument and
people that abortion support,

3991
01:53:20,690 --> 01:53:21,290
yes.

3992
01:53:21,290 --> 01:53:24,260
People that support hydraulic
fracturing support business.

3993
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:24,860
No.

3994
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:27,020
You don't understand nick
use if you fucking Hippie,

3995
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:28,640
you understand business.

3996
01:53:28,670 --> 01:53:29,270
Okay.

3997
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:33,530
The way business gets done is it's
cheaper to get that oil out than it is to

3998
01:53:33,531 --> 01:53:36,620
rely on foreign oil
and endanger Americans.

3999
01:53:36,710 --> 01:53:38,240
Like it's that sort of attitude.

4000
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:38,870
It's like,

4001
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:41,390
and then there's the people that
are like environmentally conscious.

4002
01:53:41,391 --> 01:53:41,511
Go,

4003
01:53:41,511 --> 01:53:41,601
Whoa,

4004
01:53:41,601 --> 01:53:41,721
Whoa,

4005
01:53:41,721 --> 01:53:41,931
whoa,

4006
01:53:41,931 --> 01:53:42,081
Whoa,

4007
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:42,291
whoa.

4008
01:53:42,291 --> 01:53:43,124
What's happening?

4009
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:44,990
Like how much water is getting polluted?

4010
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:46,190
Like how many wells are there?

4011
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:47,640
There's millions who,

4012
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:48,140
hold on,

4013
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:48,740
wait a minute,

4014
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:50,690
you guys have a million fracking wells?

4015
01:53:50,691 --> 01:53:53,150
There's a million and it's
causing earthquakes too.

4016
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:53,720
Well,

4017
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:53,901
Whoa,

4018
01:53:53,901 --> 01:53:54,140
Whoa,

4019
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:54,381
Whoa,

4020
01:53:54,381 --> 01:53:54,621
whoa,

4021
01:53:54,621 --> 01:53:54,861
Whoa,

4022
01:53:54,861 --> 01:53:55,071
whoa.

4023
01:53:55,071 --> 01:53:55,460
You can't,

4024
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:55,790
well,

4025
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:56,990
what we need now,

4026
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:58,100
it's not hippies.

4027
01:53:58,101 --> 01:54:00,080
What we need now now oil,

4028
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:01,220
patriotism,

4029
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:03,523
oil.

4030
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:05,840
I'm not pro or con fracking,

4031
01:54:05,841 --> 01:54:06,560
these gentlemen.

4032
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:10,940
I'm not opposed to putting a fence around
a certain area of like South Dakota

4033
01:54:10,941 --> 01:54:15,350
where nobody goes and fracking the shit
out of that bitch and not having to go

4034
01:54:15,351 --> 01:54:17,030
to war for fall foreign oil.

4035
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:19,010
I'm not totally opposed to that.

4036
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:21,860
My problem is I don't
think it's controlled.

4037
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:22,450
I don't,

4038
01:54:22,450 --> 01:54:23,450
and when you talk about like,

4039
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:23,930
all right,

4040
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:26,120
let's guess how many
fracking wells are there?

4041
01:54:26,121 --> 01:54:26,640
Let's take it.

4042
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:27,470
Take a wild guess.

4043
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:30,260
They've been fracking in Ohio lately
and now we have all these earthquakes.

4044
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:31,260
Yeah.

4045
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:32,093
Proven.

4046
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:32,810
Proven.

4047
01:54:32,810 --> 01:54:34,370
That's so scary.

4048
01:54:34,580 --> 01:54:34,911
Okay.

4049
01:54:34,911 --> 01:54:38,660
How many fracking wells
in the u s a thousand.

4050
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:39,740
That's so cute.

4051
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:41,540
That's a really low number.

4052
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:41,841
Oh,

4053
01:54:41,841 --> 01:54:43,000
that's so close.

4054
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:44,890
Low to look.

4055
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:46,100
You're handsome bastard,

4056
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:47,001
but that,

4057
01:54:47,001 --> 01:54:47,331
no,

4058
01:54:47,331 --> 01:54:48,410
I'm saying it's so low.

4059
01:54:48,411 --> 01:54:49,220
It's ridiculous.

4060
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:50,550
I bet it's more than a billion,

4061
01:54:51,110 --> 01:54:51,943
I would say.

4062
01:54:53,870 --> 01:54:54,320
Yeah,

4063
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:55,153
I think so.

4064
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:57,380
I would say yeah,

4065
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:59,720
5,000 to 10,000 that's it.

4066
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:00,111
Okay.

4067
01:55:00,111 --> 01:55:03,950
You guys say in the thousands would you
say I said I said around a thousand you

4068
01:55:03,951 --> 01:55:05,960
said five thousand ten
thousand I said a million.

4069
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:08,623
I bet you guys were right.

4070
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:10,033
Okay.

4071
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:12,860
2013 to two two,

4072
01:55:12,861 --> 01:55:13,041
two,

4073
01:55:13,041 --> 01:55:14,090
two.

4074
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:14,983
What's the numbers?

4075
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:20,040
So numbers over 1.1 million active
oil and gas wells in the u s whoa.

4076
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:23,280
Wow.

4077
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:23,511
All right.

4078
01:55:23,511 --> 01:55:24,500
How many of them are fractured?

4079
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:29,400
Many people ask us how many wells
have been hydraulically fracture?

4080
01:55:29,401 --> 01:55:30,234
The United States?

4081
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:31,850
It's an excellent question,

4082
01:55:31,851 --> 01:55:33,470
but not one that's easily answered.

4083
01:55:33,471 --> 01:55:38,471
Most states don't release the data
on well stimulation activities.

4084
01:55:39,021 --> 01:55:39,471
Also,

4085
01:55:39,471 --> 01:55:42,890
since the data are released
by state regulatory agencies,

4086
01:55:42,891 --> 01:55:47,880
it is necessary to obtain data from each
state that has oil and gas data to even

4087
01:55:47,881 --> 01:55:49,170
begin the conversation.

4088
01:55:49,171 --> 01:55:53,790
We finally had a chance to complete
the task and have able to be,

4089
01:55:53,810 --> 01:55:54,510
uh,

4090
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:56,340
able to aggregate the following totals.

4091
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:56,731
Wow.

4092
01:55:56,731 --> 01:55:57,570
This is pretty nuts,

4093
01:55:57,571 --> 01:55:58,404
man.

4094
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:01,020
There's a lot of fucking Wellsboro.

4095
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:02,310
There's over a million.

4096
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:04,590
Whoa.

4097
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:05,453
That's crazy.

4098
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:05,970
Ooh,

4099
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:06,810
that's scary,

4100
01:56:08,190 --> 01:56:08,700
man.

4101
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:13,140
How is that a better idea than investing
in like solar paneling and like

4102
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:14,640
alternate sources?

4103
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:15,360
I Dunno.

4104
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,250
There's a bunch of different
kinds of wells though.

4105
01:56:17,251 --> 01:56:18,810
So let me just clarify that.

4106
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:20,731
There's,

4107
01:56:20,731 --> 01:56:21,330
um,

4108
01:56:21,330 --> 01:56:22,380
directional.

4109
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:23,460
There's a bunch of different types,

4110
01:56:23,461 --> 01:56:24,121
directional,

4111
01:56:24,121 --> 01:56:24,954
horizontal,

4112
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:26,790
either direction or horizontal.

4113
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:27,683
Vertical,

4114
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:29,220
hydraulically fractured,

4115
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:30,240
not fractured,

4116
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:33,030
unknown or shale formation.

4117
01:56:33,810 --> 01:56:35,700
So all of these,

4118
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:36,810
all of these,

4119
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:37,710
it's a million,

4120
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:40,830
but it says hydraulically fractured.

4121
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:42,480
It says one 30.

4122
01:56:42,990 --> 01:56:47,990
But does that mean is only 130 fracking
wells as east state releases data

4123
01:56:48,181 --> 01:56:48,811
differently?

4124
01:56:48,811 --> 01:56:52,680
It wasn't always possible to get
consistent data on fracking wells.

4125
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:55,860
These wells are known to be
hydraulically flat fractured,

4126
01:56:55,861 --> 01:56:58,620
but the slant of the well is unknown.

4127
01:56:59,070 --> 01:56:59,550
Oh,

4128
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:00,383
I see.

4129
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:01,253
Okay.

4130
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:04,140
They have a bunch of different
ways that they get the wall,

4131
01:57:04,170 --> 01:57:04,921
the water out,

4132
01:57:04,921 --> 01:57:07,020
or get the oil out.

4133
01:57:07,470 --> 01:57:08,850
This is fascinating shit,

4134
01:57:08,851 --> 01:57:09,480
man.

4135
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:10,320
They go down,

4136
01:57:10,321 --> 01:57:11,430
then they take turns.

4137
01:57:11,850 --> 01:57:12,211
They're like,

4138
01:57:12,211 --> 01:57:15,990
they'll go down and then take left turns
or they'll go like horizontally or the

4139
01:57:15,991 --> 01:57:17,370
good and angle into the earth,

4140
01:57:17,371 --> 01:57:18,390
depending on where the,

4141
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:20,580
where the rock is and where the oil is.

4142
01:57:20,581 --> 01:57:21,630
They're trying to suck out.

4143
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:22,643
Wow.

4144
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:24,990
That's how crazy fucking thing man.

4145
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:26,580
Hydraulically fractured.

4146
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:27,001
Okay.

4147
01:57:27,001 --> 01:57:27,834
Here it is.

4148
01:57:27,970 --> 01:57:31,920
[inaudible] wells that have
been hydraulically fractured
might appear in any of

4149
01:57:31,921 --> 01:57:35,850
the eight categories with the
obvious exception of not fractured.

4150
01:57:35,851 --> 01:57:40,851
So that's the only one that doesn't
have a hydraulically fractured wells

4151
01:57:41,490 --> 01:57:42,360
included in it.

4152
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:48,150
So a categories that are very likely
to be fractured include horizontal,

4153
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:52,170
hydraulically fractured and
unknown shale formation.

4154
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:55,440
The total of which is 32,000 wells.

4155
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,930
That's most likely to be fractured.

4156
01:57:57,931 --> 01:57:58,764
So they don't know,

4157
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:00,930
but at least 32,000 however,

4158
01:58:00,931 --> 01:58:05,931
the number doesn't include any wells
from Texas or Colorado where we know

4159
01:58:06,361 --> 01:58:10,170
thousands of wells have been
drilled into major shell formation,

4160
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:11,190
shale formations.

4161
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:15,540
But the data for which had to be placed
into categories that were more vague.

4162
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:18,390
So there's different states have
different like regulatory bodies,

4163
01:58:18,391 --> 01:58:23,140
I guess the states that are better
to to fucking rape the earth and

4164
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:27,990
they probably are better off
hiding the information to,

4165
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:29,520
so it seems like,

4166
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:30,330
um,

4167
01:58:30,330 --> 01:58:35,250
what they're saying is like 32,000 plus
hydraulically fractured ones that they

4168
01:58:35,251 --> 01:58:38,850
could locate that they'd know are
most likely hydraulically fractured.

4169
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:41,770
But then there's a bunch of
the other ones that could,

4170
01:58:42,730 --> 01:58:44,440
and the ones that aren't fractured,

4171
01:58:44,441 --> 01:58:49,360
there's only 7,477 of
them out of the 1,136,000.

4172
01:58:50,190 --> 01:58:52,500
What's crazy is that
they create earthquakes.

4173
01:58:53,670 --> 01:58:54,270
Yeah,

4174
01:58:54,270 --> 01:58:54,961
it's fucked.

4175
01:58:54,961 --> 01:58:55,800
And then it's still like,

4176
01:58:55,801 --> 01:58:56,071
Nah,

4177
01:58:56,071 --> 01:58:56,904
it's worth it.

4178
01:58:57,090 --> 01:58:57,923
It's worth it.

4179
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,240
It's worth it if you
keep your family warm.

4180
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:01,253
Yeah.

4181
01:59:01,770 --> 01:59:02,730
It's for American America.

4182
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,800
Save America.

4183
01:59:04,801 --> 01:59:08,930
Save America's going to be a puddle of
Goo Stinky puddle of Goo and dead elk

4184
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:12,660
choking bison with their
fucking lego though.

4185
01:59:12,661 --> 01:59:15,020
When hair gagging blood out,

4186
01:59:15,021 --> 01:59:17,270
they have a new Ebola
that comes only from oil.

4187
01:59:17,330 --> 01:59:18,163
Right?

4188
01:59:19,790 --> 01:59:20,300
Yeah.

4189
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:21,050
I don't know man.

4190
01:59:21,050 --> 01:59:23,390
I just wish there's a
better way to power shit.

4191
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:24,410
I wonder if there would,

4192
01:59:24,770 --> 01:59:27,080
like if there was no oil,

4193
01:59:27,110 --> 01:59:28,790
let's say the oil didn't exist,

4194
01:59:28,910 --> 01:59:30,800
how far do you think
civilization would have gone?

4195
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:35,510
Because there's no doubt
that the combustion engine
and making machines and the

4196
01:59:35,511 --> 01:59:39,530
trucks and engines and that's the
reason why we became what we are today.

4197
01:59:39,531 --> 01:59:44,531
There's this fucking chaotic mass
super organism that we are right.

4198
01:59:45,170 --> 01:59:46,370
So if there was no oil,

4199
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:50,330
if that wasn't an an element on earth
and the only kid to have like plant based

4200
01:59:50,331 --> 01:59:51,164
oils like

4201
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:54,620
sunflower oil or some shit.

4202
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:55,160
Yeah,

4203
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:55,970
hemp oil,

4204
01:59:55,970 --> 01:59:56,230
you know,

4205
01:59:56,230 --> 01:59:57,860
which they used for lamps and stuff.

4206
01:59:57,861 --> 02:00:00,800
They use like different kinds of oils
for lamps but no oil in the ground.

4207
02:00:01,010 --> 02:00:02,180
How far would things have gotten?

4208
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:06,030
I Dunno cause how long
would it have taken?

4209
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:08,300
This is the part of the
conversation with Brian checks out.

4210
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:10,893
Um,

4211
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:16,630
who knows like cause how long would it
have been before you'd found an alternate

4212
02:00:16,631 --> 02:00:16,841
way?

4213
02:00:16,841 --> 02:00:18,010
Like the electric car,

4214
02:00:18,011 --> 02:00:19,180
like how long did that take?

4215
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:19,691
Forever.

4216
02:00:19,691 --> 02:00:20,350
But you need it.

4217
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:22,840
You need combustion engines
to make all those things.

4218
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:24,550
See what making an electric car,

4219
02:00:24,820 --> 02:00:25,300
there's,

4220
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:30,300
you need an engine to take the parts to
get the parts to the car manufacturer to

4221
02:00:30,401 --> 02:00:31,420
deliver the stuff.

4222
02:00:31,450 --> 02:00:33,370
Like those are all being
delivered with trucks,

4223
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:34,210
right?

4224
02:00:34,210 --> 02:00:37,570
Like this idea that like you get
electric car and your Karma free.

4225
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:38,740
This is nonsense.

4226
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:39,281
What does that,

4227
02:00:39,281 --> 02:00:40,300
that technology would,

4228
02:00:40,301 --> 02:00:42,750
it had been created for the manufacturing.

4229
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:44,620
Everything would had to
been run electrically.

4230
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:45,360
Exactly.

4231
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,390
But how long would it have taken?

4232
02:00:46,391 --> 02:00:47,500
Forever to discover.

4233
02:00:47,501 --> 02:00:48,100
Yeah,

4234
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:48,820
forever.

4235
02:00:48,820 --> 02:00:49,431
Without the,

4236
02:00:49,431 --> 02:00:53,200
the motor to take the
parts to put it together.

4237
02:00:53,201 --> 02:00:55,310
Like you had to pick up the
tire somewhere and driving.

4238
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:57,550
Those aren't electric trucks,

4239
02:00:58,470 --> 02:00:58,960
you know,

4240
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:00,370
it would have been like wagons.

4241
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:01,840
That was so many years.

4242
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:05,210
Oxen would have had oxen
pulling your fucking tires.

4243
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:10,190
And then how are they going to figure
out a way to power up these machines?

4244
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:12,140
What's the going to
fire up the electricity?

4245
02:01:12,141 --> 02:01:15,920
They're gonna use that dam and the
dam fires up the electricity for these

4246
02:01:15,921 --> 02:01:18,970
machines and these machines
build this engine and,

4247
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:22,160
and is there enough electricity to
charge batteries and where are you guys

4248
02:01:22,161 --> 02:01:23,000
getting the batteries?

4249
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,840
Where are you getting the
minerals that go into batteries?

4250
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:26,000
You've got to go to Afghanistan,

4251
02:01:26,001 --> 02:01:26,241
man.

4252
02:01:26,241 --> 02:01:26,490
Yeah,

4253
02:01:26,490 --> 02:01:27,680
you got a drill for them.

4254
02:01:27,710 --> 02:01:29,000
How are you going to get to Afghanistan?

4255
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:30,150
The oxen can't swim.

4256
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:33,560
You gotta take a fucking raft,

4257
02:01:34,090 --> 02:01:36,080
fill it up with minerals from Afghanistan.

4258
02:01:36,081 --> 02:01:37,700
If floaty back to America,

4259
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,170
build your stupid electric.

4260
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:45,140
The battery would have been invented in
like 1973 it would have taken that long.

4261
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:46,700
This is what Obama meant when he was like,

4262
02:01:46,701 --> 02:01:49,040
when you started a smart
built small business,

4263
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:50,143
you didn't build that.

4264
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:51,643
That's what he meant.

4265
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:53,060
The infrastructure.

4266
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:55,700
You cannot have an electric
car without the infrastructure.

4267
02:01:55,820 --> 02:01:56,330
Right.

4268
02:01:56,330 --> 02:01:59,420
They created batteries back
in the Egyptian days though.

4269
02:01:59,600 --> 02:01:59,961
Yeah.

4270
02:01:59,961 --> 02:02:00,531
So they might,

4271
02:02:00,531 --> 02:02:01,364
might have been,

4272
02:02:02,150 --> 02:02:03,770
I think they could have
probably done something.

4273
02:02:03,771 --> 02:02:04,400
It would have been,

4274
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:05,930
well those batteries were dog shit.

4275
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:06,793
By the way.

4276
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:08,450
Everybody's like,

4277
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:09,620
iPhone batteries are amazing.

4278
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:10,820
They weren't even iPhone one.

4279
02:02:10,830 --> 02:02:11,780
They weren't even close.

4280
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:12,621
They were stupid.

4281
02:02:12,621 --> 02:02:13,580
They wouldn't even Duracell.

4282
02:02:14,030 --> 02:02:16,040
Those bitches could even power a light.

4283
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:18,440
Like you couldn't like I have like the,

4284
02:02:18,450 --> 02:02:18,951
the light,

4285
02:02:18,951 --> 02:02:20,300
the power is your cell phone.

4286
02:02:20,650 --> 02:02:20,841
You're like,

4287
02:02:20,841 --> 02:02:23,150
I went out to close my chicken
coop last night and uh,

4288
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:25,100
when I use my phone as a flashlight,

4289
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:26,390
the new iPhone has a,

4290
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:27,140
an uh,

4291
02:02:27,140 --> 02:02:28,960
like builtin flashlight thing.

4292
02:02:28,970 --> 02:02:29,600
Yeah.

4293
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:31,910
You slide this thing up
and he hit that and boom,

4294
02:02:31,911 --> 02:02:32,744
you've got a flashlight.

4295
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:33,920
It takes two seconds.

4296
02:02:33,921 --> 02:02:34,530
It's built in.

4297
02:02:34,530 --> 02:02:35,810
It's such a slick thing.

4298
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:37,333
You know,

4299
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:38,841
God's side.

4300
02:02:38,841 --> 02:02:39,561
That wouldn't work.

4301
02:02:39,561 --> 02:02:40,161
That it's stupid.

4302
02:02:40,161 --> 02:02:41,000
Egyptian battery,

4303
02:02:41,001 --> 02:02:42,270
big goof ass thing.

4304
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:43,520
Got a carrier on this pot.

4305
02:02:44,330 --> 02:02:45,320
Copper core.

4306
02:02:47,390 --> 02:02:47,781
Yes.

4307
02:02:47,781 --> 02:02:48,620
He made a big one.

4308
02:02:48,621 --> 02:02:49,850
Like the size of a,

4309
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:50,840
you know,

4310
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:51,673
like a pyramid.

4311
02:02:51,910 --> 02:02:54,620
You stepped pyramid was
all battery the whole time.

4312
02:02:54,650 --> 02:02:55,191
Do you imagine that?

4313
02:02:55,191 --> 02:02:57,830
That's what it was
soothing to our battery.

4314
02:02:57,831 --> 02:02:59,800
We'll be up for her whole pyramids.

4315
02:02:59,810 --> 02:03:02,990
A post that was like one of the
crazy conspiracy theory hypothesis.

4316
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:04,640
The pyramid was a giant,

4317
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:06,140
some sort of a power plant.

4318
02:03:06,230 --> 02:03:06,680
Really?

4319
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:06,951
Yeah,

4320
02:03:06,951 --> 02:03:07,131
yeah,

4321
02:03:07,131 --> 02:03:08,180
yeah of course.

4322
02:03:08,190 --> 02:03:09,023
Believe it.

4323
02:03:09,230 --> 02:03:10,730
If you can think it up,

4324
02:03:10,790 --> 02:03:15,790
somebody has like probably written blog
entries about it doesn't matter how

4325
02:03:16,341 --> 02:03:17,480
cookie the idea is.

4326
02:03:17,780 --> 02:03:19,460
If you could think up a Kooky idea,

4327
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:21,350
somebody has written some shit about it.

4328
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:25,310
I was thinking of bugs the
other day because there was
a praying mantis that was

4329
02:03:25,311 --> 02:03:29,600
on my porch that just hung out the
whole whole day and he has these huge

4330
02:03:29,601 --> 02:03:30,530
antennas and I was like,

4331
02:03:30,531 --> 02:03:34,400
isn't it weird that we don't really focus
like these bugs have like antennas on

4332
02:03:34,401 --> 02:03:36,020
them like in the future,

4333
02:03:36,021 --> 02:03:39,410
like we're going to find out that these
are like aliens that are communicating

4334
02:03:39,411 --> 02:03:40,790
with each other through some,

4335
02:03:40,791 --> 02:03:41,990
well they might as well be aliens.

4336
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:44,510
We just don't give a shit about
him cause they're a little,

4337
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:45,403
yeah,

4338
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:46,840
we can just kick them out of the way.

4339
02:03:46,890 --> 02:03:47,900
Little drones,

4340
02:03:47,950 --> 02:03:49,400
you know their drones for aliens.

4341
02:03:49,401 --> 02:03:51,440
There's like these little what they are.

4342
02:03:51,441 --> 02:03:54,980
It's a weird little life form that shares
the world with us that has no morals,

4343
02:03:55,010 --> 02:03:55,843
no ethics.

4344
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:58,820
So ruthless coldhearted
emotionless killers.

4345
02:03:59,090 --> 02:04:00,490
And they have a hard skeleton.

4346
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:01,820
They don't need each other's touch.

4347
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:02,390
Yeah.

4348
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:07,390
They have this very bizarre military
organization as far as they have a queen,

4349
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:08,300
you know,

4350
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:08,840
they have,

4351
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:09,420
they have a,

4352
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:10,720
the worker bees and they're,

4353
02:04:10,730 --> 02:04:13,310
they're building shelter
and protecting the hive.

4354
02:04:13,311 --> 02:04:14,870
And they're weird man.

4355
02:04:15,020 --> 02:04:17,300
We just don't think of him as being
so weird cause they're little.

4356
02:04:17,301 --> 02:04:18,950
And we could just wait for him like that.

4357
02:04:19,370 --> 02:04:20,600
But if a bear this big,

4358
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:21,853
oh I know.

4359
02:04:22,730 --> 02:04:23,150
Yeah.

4360
02:04:23,150 --> 02:04:24,080
But a lot of them it's like,

4361
02:04:24,081 --> 02:04:24,320
whoa.

4362
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:25,880
Like if they all of a sudden became big,

4363
02:04:25,881 --> 02:04:26,750
we're like fuck.

4364
02:04:26,751 --> 02:04:27,200
And then we're like,

4365
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:27,651
oh cool.

4366
02:04:27,651 --> 02:04:28,730
They only live for four days.

4367
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:29,803
Thank God.

4368
02:04:30,490 --> 02:04:31,550
Neutralized soon.

4369
02:04:31,670 --> 02:04:31,851
Yeah.

4370
02:04:31,851 --> 02:04:32,870
But there's so many of them.

4371
02:04:33,310 --> 02:04:33,830
Yeah.

4372
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:35,630
Before we start killing
them off with cell phones,

4373
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:37,950
cell and pesticides.

4374
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,140
Apparently the third one
that's whacked them out.

4375
02:04:40,170 --> 02:04:41,280
I remember when you were a kid,

4376
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:42,180
bees were everywhere.

4377
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:43,950
How often do you see being,

4378
02:04:44,070 --> 02:04:46,140
have you seen bees every day at my house?

4379
02:04:46,250 --> 02:04:46,380
You,

4380
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:48,540
but do you see bees like you saw
on beans when you were a kid?

4381
02:04:48,570 --> 02:04:48,810
Well,

4382
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:51,240
I haven't tended be like
bees nests everywhere.

4383
02:04:51,820 --> 02:04:52,190
You do?

4384
02:04:52,190 --> 02:04:52,540
Yeah.

4385
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:52,810
Really?

4386
02:04:52,810 --> 02:04:53,600
Wow.

4387
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:54,200
Sucks.

4388
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:58,110
Maybe you got a sweet
spot for bees and wasps.

4389
02:04:58,480 --> 02:04:58,680
I see.

4390
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:00,570
Populations are pretty
down though aren't thing.

4391
02:05:00,590 --> 02:05:01,201
Wasn't that like a,

4392
02:05:01,201 --> 02:05:02,370
it's a major concern.

4393
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:04,650
Let's say dropping bee populations.

4394
02:05:04,890 --> 02:05:05,850
Let's play another game.

4395
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:09,330
I say bee populations are down by 40%.

4396
02:05:09,690 --> 02:05:10,231
40.

4397
02:05:10,231 --> 02:05:11,064
Wow.

4398
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:14,970
I would say 25,

4399
02:05:14,971 --> 02:05:16,860
20% to 25%.

4400
02:05:16,861 --> 02:05:17,191
What'd He say,

4401
02:05:17,191 --> 02:05:17,650
Ryan?

4402
02:05:17,650 --> 02:05:18,420
Uh,

4403
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:19,230
I say it's up.

4404
02:05:19,230 --> 02:05:19,651
I say,

4405
02:05:19,651 --> 02:05:21,060
I think it's a big conspiracy.

4406
02:05:21,061 --> 02:05:24,360
I think these are more ever because
it all around Brian's house.

4407
02:05:24,930 --> 02:05:28,560
We have a bee problem
lead to stop these bees.

4408
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:29,070
Okay.

4409
02:05:29,070 --> 02:05:29,970
30%.

4410
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:31,020
Um,

4411
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:32,070
it's even crazier.

4412
02:05:32,180 --> 02:05:32,910
Um,

4413
02:05:32,910 --> 02:05:37,910
30% in the U s beekeepers experience
losses of 40 or 50% or more.

4414
02:05:38,190 --> 02:05:39,023
Wow.

4415
02:05:39,170 --> 02:05:39,420
Well,

4416
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:39,630
yeah,

4417
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:44,400
just says commercial B operations
prepared to transport their hives to the

4418
02:05:44,401 --> 02:05:46,140
country's largest pollinator event.

4419
02:05:46,141 --> 02:05:49,710
The fertile is fertilizing
of California's almond trees.

4420
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:50,101
Oh,

4421
02:05:50,101 --> 02:05:50,940
that's interesting.

4422
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:52,200
So they,

4423
02:05:52,201 --> 02:05:52,470
um,

4424
02:05:52,470 --> 02:05:54,540
I guess they hire people to go do that.

4425
02:05:54,570 --> 02:05:58,110
They bring bees and
the bees a populate or,

4426
02:05:58,150 --> 02:05:58,410
uh,

4427
02:05:58,410 --> 02:06:00,390
bees pollinate these plants.

4428
02:06:00,391 --> 02:06:01,260
That's pretty cool.

4429
02:06:01,650 --> 02:06:02,160
Wow.

4430
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:05,250
Spread out across 800,000 acres.

4431
02:06:05,251 --> 02:06:10,251
California's almond orchards typically
require 1.6 million domesticated bee

4432
02:06:11,041 --> 02:06:15,060
colonies to pollinate the flowering
trees and produce what has become the

4433
02:06:15,061 --> 02:06:17,760
state's largest overseas
agricultural export.

4434
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:22,530
I did not know that almonds
are largest overseas export.

4435
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:23,513
And why is that?

4436
02:06:23,610 --> 02:06:26,040
Because weeds illegal bitch,

4437
02:06:27,110 --> 02:06:30,870
if we was legal t you don't think that
people in like Portugal would be dying to

4438
02:06:30,871 --> 02:06:33,270
get ahold of some Goddamn California weed.

4439
02:06:34,340 --> 02:06:34,950
Um,

4440
02:06:34,950 --> 02:06:38,820
but given widespread be losses to
so called colony collapse disorder.

4441
02:06:38,821 --> 02:06:39,301
This winter,

4442
02:06:39,301 --> 02:06:43,170
California's almond growers were able
to pollinate their crop only through an

4443
02:06:43,171 --> 02:06:48,030
intense nationwide push to cobble together
the necessary number of healthy bee

4444
02:06:48,031 --> 02:06:48,864
colonies.

4445
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:49,891
Wow.

4446
02:06:49,891 --> 02:06:51,090
Nationwide push.

4447
02:06:51,091 --> 02:06:52,020
That's crazy.

4448
02:06:52,710 --> 02:06:57,270
That's how they grow almonds
at the top saying it's amazing.

4449
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:58,500
So cool.

4450
02:06:58,830 --> 02:07:02,280
I love when I find out something like
this where I had no idea that they,

4451
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:03,780
I didn't know that I thought bees,

4452
02:07:03,781 --> 02:07:04,061
they may,

4453
02:07:04,061 --> 02:07:05,310
they just made honey and you know,

4454
02:07:05,311 --> 02:07:06,121
they're pollinated shit,

4455
02:07:06,121 --> 02:07:08,430
but I didn't know that they
needed him to grow almonds.

4456
02:07:08,431 --> 02:07:08,850
Yeah,

4457
02:07:08,850 --> 02:07:10,500
they're domesticated.

4458
02:07:10,530 --> 02:07:11,370
That's crazy,

4459
02:07:11,371 --> 02:07:11,600
man.

4460
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:13,080
I thought they only did one thing.

4461
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:15,120
They make two delicious items.

4462
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:16,620
Almonds.

4463
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:17,041
Yeah.

4464
02:07:17,041 --> 02:07:18,150
If it wasn't around,

4465
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:19,530
that's amazing.

4466
02:07:19,740 --> 02:07:24,740
But that these colonies were down and
that in order to pollinate all of their

4467
02:07:25,291 --> 02:07:25,681
plants,

4468
02:07:25,681 --> 02:07:26,280
they need to,

4469
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:27,810
they needed to bring in other bees.

4470
02:07:27,810 --> 02:07:30,210
There's not like another possibility.

4471
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:30,631
They're like,

4472
02:07:30,631 --> 02:07:30,751
no,

4473
02:07:30,751 --> 02:07:30,871
no,

4474
02:07:30,871 --> 02:07:31,021
no,

4475
02:07:31,021 --> 02:07:31,170
no,

4476
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:31,351
no.

4477
02:07:31,351 --> 02:07:32,210
We need bees.

4478
02:07:32,490 --> 02:07:33,960
But isn't there another method?

4479
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:34,530
Let's,

4480
02:07:34,530 --> 02:07:36,130
let's put our heads together and no,

4481
02:07:36,131 --> 02:07:36,261
no,

4482
02:07:36,261 --> 02:07:36,401
no,

4483
02:07:36,401 --> 02:07:36,521
no,

4484
02:07:36,521 --> 02:07:36,671
no,

4485
02:07:36,671 --> 02:07:36,791
no,

4486
02:07:36,791 --> 02:07:36,911
no,

4487
02:07:36,911 --> 02:07:37,061
no,

4488
02:07:37,061 --> 02:07:37,170
no.

4489
02:07:37,170 --> 02:07:37,430
Let's go.

4490
02:07:37,430 --> 02:07:38,263
Not going to grow.

4491
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:39,141
You need bees are,

4492
02:07:39,141 --> 02:07:39,701
it's not going to grow.

4493
02:07:39,701 --> 02:07:43,210
That really puts into light
how important bees are.

4494
02:07:43,270 --> 02:07:45,880
Something like that that
really makes you realize like,

4495
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:46,773
oh,

4496
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:49,060
like if it's not for bs,

4497
02:07:49,061 --> 02:07:49,360
there's,

4498
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:50,680
there's not a lot of shit.

4499
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:53,290
Like you need those little cunty bugs.

4500
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:54,183
Yeah.

4501
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:56,051
That's bizarre,

4502
02:07:56,051 --> 02:07:56,740
man.

4503
02:07:56,740 --> 02:07:58,750
And there's this image on,

4504
02:07:58,751 --> 02:07:59,584
um,

4505
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:00,071
the,

4506
02:08:00,071 --> 02:08:00,370
uh,

4507
02:08:00,370 --> 02:08:00,700
this,

4508
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:00,821
uh,

4509
02:08:00,821 --> 02:08:04,660
Yale site where I'm reading the story
and there's this dude who's dressed up in

4510
02:08:04,661 --> 02:08:08,620
this beekeeper's outfit and he's like
handling these bees and moving them around

4511
02:08:08,621 --> 02:08:09,011
in these,

4512
02:08:09,011 --> 02:08:09,844
uh,

4513
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:10,571
in these,

4514
02:08:10,571 --> 02:08:10,750
uh,

4515
02:08:10,750 --> 02:08:11,950
California farms,

4516
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:13,510
these a onion crops.

4517
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:15,280
And you're looking at and be like,

4518
02:08:15,490 --> 02:08:18,880
how was that much different than
the Ebola guy would have it?

4519
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:19,601
I mean,

4520
02:08:19,601 --> 02:08:19,871
he's,

4521
02:08:19,871 --> 02:08:23,290
he's got a fucking crazy suit as well,

4522
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:28,120
and that is fully suited up for
an invasion of attacking monsters.

4523
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:29,493
You know,

4524
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:32,080
what does that Brian's 20
Hinchcliffe dressed up as a B.

4525
02:08:32,090 --> 02:08:32,923
He is

4526
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:35,810
the greatest movie of all time.

4527
02:08:38,590 --> 02:08:38,920
What's,

4528
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:40,160
what do wasps do?

4529
02:08:40,161 --> 02:08:41,750
Anything positive you fuck up?

4530
02:08:41,790 --> 02:08:42,623
Bees?

4531
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:46,940
WASPS would say the ones that can keep
stinging you as where it'd be like,

4532
02:08:46,941 --> 02:08:47,300
it's like,

4533
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:47,780
wow.

4534
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:48,920
It's like a kamikaze mission.

4535
02:08:48,950 --> 02:08:49,880
It's like one and done

4536
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:51,400
wasps.

4537
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:51,731
Yeah.

4538
02:08:51,731 --> 02:08:52,720
Have you ever seen that video?

4539
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:55,180
The Japanese Hornets killing the beehive?

4540
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:55,950
No.

4541
02:08:55,950 --> 02:08:56,771
Ooh,

4542
02:08:56,771 --> 02:08:58,240
it's the weirdest video ever,

4543
02:08:58,241 --> 02:08:58,571
man.

4544
02:08:58,571 --> 02:08:59,530
Because it's this.

4545
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:01,000
If we put it on,

4546
02:09:01,030 --> 02:09:02,800
it'll probably get us
kicked off of Youtube.

4547
02:09:02,801 --> 02:09:03,071
Right?

4548
02:09:03,071 --> 02:09:03,904
Is that how it works?

4549
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:04,740
That's one really.

4550
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:05,650
It's one of those ones,

4551
02:09:05,930 --> 02:09:07,270
these nature documentaries,

4552
02:09:07,271 --> 02:09:07,631
man,

4553
02:09:07,631 --> 02:09:10,360
they'd go after you and have
you pulled from youtube what?

4554
02:09:10,450 --> 02:09:10,721
Yeah.

4555
02:09:10,721 --> 02:09:11,770
Nature documentaries.

4556
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:12,663
People own them.

4557
02:09:12,670 --> 02:09:13,100
You know,

4558
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:17,650
that probably cost a grip of money to
film high speed video footage of some

4559
02:09:17,651 --> 02:09:18,490
Japanese Hornets.

4560
02:09:18,491 --> 02:09:19,600
Fucking up some honey bees.

4561
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:21,610
But just do me a favor.

4562
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:24,060
Go just Google Japanese Hornets.

4563
02:09:24,061 --> 02:09:26,470
Fuck up honeybees and check
it out because it's amazing.

4564
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:27,760
They're monsters.

4565
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:29,140
They're the cut their heads off.

4566
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:32,230
They just cut the honeybees
heads off and like,

4567
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:37,320
I think it was like 30 bees killed 30,000
bees or 30 hornets killed 30,000 bees,

4568
02:09:38,770 --> 02:09:39,730
something nutty like that.

4569
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:41,230
It's like darn near 11 war,

4570
02:09:41,890 --> 02:09:42,611
but it's not a war.

4571
02:09:42,611 --> 02:09:45,430
It's like you with a hatchet
and a room full of babies.

4572
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:47,850
It's like there's no,

4573
02:09:47,851 --> 02:09:48,910
no one's fighting back.

4574
02:09:48,911 --> 02:09:49,151
I mean,

4575
02:09:49,151 --> 02:09:49,984
they can't do anything.

4576
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:51,490
They just chopped their heads off

4577
02:09:53,050 --> 02:09:55,150
or something along those lines.

4578
02:09:55,151 --> 02:09:55,570
Right?

4579
02:09:55,570 --> 02:09:58,180
Like the only way they can kill
them is they have to overheat them.

4580
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:01,300
So they do is they all swarm
on top on the hold the,

4581
02:10:01,301 --> 02:10:02,820
the Hornet down and they,

4582
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:04,390
they keep buzzing.

4583
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:07,510
They buzz on them and raise his
internal temperature until he dies.

4584
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:08,800
Holy Shit.

4585
02:10:08,890 --> 02:10:09,520
Yeah.

4586
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:10,630
That's the only way they can kill him.

4587
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:11,561
They can't kill him.

4588
02:10:11,561 --> 02:10:13,000
I stadium doesn't work.

4589
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:14,770
I can't get through their fucking armor.

4590
02:10:15,950 --> 02:10:18,040
So they just turn the
heat up until they die.

4591
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:19,300
They smother him,

4592
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:20,680
they fucking torture them.

4593
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:21,933
It's the only way to do it.

4594
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:22,773
What else would you do?

4595
02:10:23,170 --> 02:10:24,160
Just trying to eat your babies.

4596
02:10:24,370 --> 02:10:25,203
Chop their heads off.

4597
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:26,413
Fuck.

4598
02:10:27,170 --> 02:10:27,290
It's

4599
02:10:27,290 --> 02:10:28,250
crazy that he's like,

4600
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:32,330
invasions are happening with
living a such a small level.

4601
02:10:32,331 --> 02:10:35,630
You think bees are dumb be just flying
around making honey and meanwhile they're

4602
02:10:35,631 --> 02:10:35,751
like,

4603
02:10:35,751 --> 02:10:36,584
here's the plan.

4604
02:10:36,670 --> 02:10:37,400
All right,

4605
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:41,060
we're going in and we're going to heat
the fucking place up until everyone dies.

4606
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:41,691
Well the the,

4607
02:10:41,691 --> 02:10:41,931
no,

4608
02:10:41,931 --> 02:10:42,141
the,

4609
02:10:42,141 --> 02:10:43,670
the bees do that to the hornets,

4610
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:44,440
but

4611
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:45,010
the do,

4612
02:10:45,010 --> 02:10:46,540
what they do is say one horn,

4613
02:10:46,541 --> 02:10:49,900
it will be a scout Hornet and the scout
Horner will show up and when the scout

4614
02:10:49,901 --> 02:10:50,591
horn it shows up.

4615
02:10:50,591 --> 02:10:51,970
That's when the bee swarm it,

4616
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:55,510
the bee swarm it and hold it down and
try to kill it because if they don't kill

4617
02:10:55,511 --> 02:10:55,631
it,

4618
02:10:55,631 --> 02:10:56,620
if it gets back to the horn,

4619
02:10:56,630 --> 02:10:57,191
snazzy goes,

4620
02:10:57,191 --> 02:10:57,911
Yo,

4621
02:10:57,911 --> 02:10:59,080
I found Sam B.

4622
02:10:59,860 --> 02:11:01,120
That's when shit gets crazy.

4623
02:11:01,150 --> 02:11:03,340
That's when they fly back
and fuck everybody up.

4624
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:04,660
That's insane.

4625
02:11:04,690 --> 02:11:04,841
Yeah.

4626
02:11:04,841 --> 02:11:05,800
That world,

4627
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:07,450
the Hornet B,

4628
02:11:07,570 --> 02:11:07,811
you know,

4629
02:11:07,811 --> 02:11:09,790
I think of them as sort of
the same sort of category.

4630
02:11:09,791 --> 02:11:10,900
These flying bugs.

4631
02:11:10,901 --> 02:11:14,290
It's staying like that world
is unbelievably ruthless.

4632
02:11:14,350 --> 02:11:15,183
Yeah.

4633
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:17,080
The fact that first of all,

4634
02:11:17,081 --> 02:11:19,710
the fact that there's their
stingers kill them too,

4635
02:11:20,100 --> 02:11:20,350
right?

4636
02:11:20,350 --> 02:11:22,480
Like when they extinct
a person or something,

4637
02:11:22,481 --> 02:11:23,770
it pulls out of their body.

4638
02:11:23,771 --> 02:11:27,010
Like it's this giant sword that
pulls out their body and they die.

4639
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:30,580
That happens when they have sex
that happens when they sting.

4640
02:11:31,030 --> 02:11:31,361
Yeah.

4641
02:11:31,361 --> 02:11:33,580
They only live to be like a week old.

4642
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:36,520
Like if they're lucky
and if they sting you,

4643
02:11:36,521 --> 02:11:37,354
they die.

4644
02:11:37,540 --> 02:11:38,950
And then on top of that,

4645
02:11:38,951 --> 02:11:41,290
like the female can stink all the time.

4646
02:11:41,291 --> 02:11:42,124
Like the Queen,

4647
02:11:42,340 --> 02:11:44,260
she doesn't have to worry
about her Barb coming out.

4648
02:11:44,290 --> 02:11:46,060
She can just staying all day long.

4649
02:11:46,061 --> 02:11:46,480
It was,

4650
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:49,690
but all she does is
seek out other females.

4651
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:55,080
So she walks around the hive and smells
each individual little honeycomb in

4652
02:11:56,261 --> 02:11:59,590
those little combs where the bees grow
up in whatever that's on a honeycomb.

4653
02:11:59,591 --> 02:11:59,891
What is it?

4654
02:11:59,891 --> 02:12:00,310
Uh,

4655
02:12:00,310 --> 02:12:01,143
one of those things,

4656
02:12:01,650 --> 02:12:02,483
I'm not a comb.

4657
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:03,280
Whatever it is,

4658
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:06,820
whatever those little
pods larva are growing.

4659
02:12:07,330 --> 02:12:08,980
If she finds that it's a female,

4660
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:10,173
she uses her,

4661
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:12,580
her fucking Stinger and stabs the baby.

4662
02:12:12,940 --> 02:12:13,600
What?

4663
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:14,080
Yup.

4664
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:14,913
That's what it's for.

4665
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:17,980
No other women,

4666
02:12:18,010 --> 02:12:18,843
no other women.

4667
02:12:19,030 --> 02:12:19,511
Other women.

4668
02:12:19,511 --> 02:12:20,350
There can be only one.

4669
02:12:20,351 --> 02:12:21,190
She's Highlander.

4670
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:22,090
Damn.

4671
02:12:22,090 --> 02:12:22,570
Yeah.

4672
02:12:22,570 --> 02:12:26,910
She walks around and stabs all the
females because it fucks all the dudes to

4673
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:27,490
death.

4674
02:12:27,490 --> 02:12:27,820
Yup.

4675
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:28,720
Fucks him to death.

4676
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,090
She's as as gangster as fuck.

4677
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:32,770
That's a gangster pitch.

4678
02:12:33,730 --> 02:12:34,450
Wow.

4679
02:12:34,450 --> 02:12:36,760
That might be the most gangster
bitch of the animal kingdom.

4680
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:38,610
Right?

4681
02:12:38,610 --> 02:12:43,610
I mean powerful sword on her pussy because
how many other like praying mantis or

4682
02:12:44,070 --> 02:12:45,150
black widows I guess.

4683
02:12:45,151 --> 02:12:45,390
Right.

4684
02:12:45,390 --> 02:12:46,020
Okay.

4685
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:46,853
Here's the mail.

4686
02:12:47,130 --> 02:12:48,120
Who would win in a fight?

4687
02:12:48,121 --> 02:12:50,520
A praying mantis or a wasp praying mantis.

4688
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:51,450
Okay.

4689
02:12:51,450 --> 02:12:52,260
Um,

4690
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:54,540
I'm going to go with the
wasp wasp versus praying man.

4691
02:12:54,590 --> 02:12:55,640
I'd say praying man.

4692
02:12:55,641 --> 02:12:59,920
A female praying man has decapitates
her like fucks the dude and then yeah,

4693
02:13:00,070 --> 02:13:01,250
those guys are bitches.

4694
02:13:01,730 --> 02:13:03,770
I don't know the man is versus wasp.

4695
02:13:03,830 --> 02:13:04,160
Okay.

4696
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:05,900
There's probably reach a rent.

4697
02:13:05,901 --> 02:13:07,070
Like if the wasp was like,

4698
02:13:07,071 --> 02:13:08,360
I'm going to stab you in the back.

4699
02:13:08,361 --> 02:13:09,111
That praying man,

4700
02:13:09,111 --> 02:13:10,040
that's probably couldn't get it.

4701
02:13:10,070 --> 02:13:10,640
Yeah,

4702
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:11,510
but maybe the,

4703
02:13:11,511 --> 02:13:16,511
they have like hard skeletons that
they can't be pierced by bees.

4704
02:13:16,850 --> 02:13:18,070
I'm going to go praying mantis.

4705
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:19,473
Interesting.

4706
02:13:20,010 --> 02:13:21,050
Is that your bird?

4707
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:21,470
Yeah,

4708
02:13:21,470 --> 02:13:22,590
I'm watching this pregnant.

4709
02:13:23,580 --> 02:13:24,091
Okay.

4710
02:13:24,091 --> 02:13:27,960
The amazing thing is if only the wasp
knew how vulnerable the plane praying

4711
02:13:27,961 --> 02:13:28,800
Mantis is,

4712
02:13:29,650 --> 02:13:31,770
could in numbers easily sting at to death,

4713
02:13:31,771 --> 02:13:32,431
but it doesn't.

4714
02:13:32,431 --> 02:13:35,220
The answer lies in the camouflage
strategy of the Mantis.

4715
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:38,970
And now the wasp usually visualizes
the mantis among the foliage.

4716
02:13:39,330 --> 02:13:42,000
The mantis is not seen
as a threat to the wasp.

4717
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:47,730
Large female praying mantis almost ready
to produce her egg case needs one last

4718
02:13:47,731 --> 02:13:48,564
meal.

4719
02:13:49,170 --> 02:13:50,550
It's a European wasp.

4720
02:13:50,551 --> 02:13:54,600
It says the bullies of the
insect world insect mimicry.

4721
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:55,080
They oh,

4722
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:55,913
okay.

4723
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:56,780
So guests,

4724
02:13:56,780 --> 02:13:56,980
uh,

4725
02:13:56,980 --> 02:13:57,571
that's the answer.

4726
02:13:57,571 --> 02:13:59,670
They're fucking praying names.

4727
02:13:59,671 --> 02:14:01,490
That giant Hornet versus a praying man.

4728
02:14:01,491 --> 02:14:02,920
It's the whoa dude.

4729
02:14:02,921 --> 02:14:06,330
This praying Mantis
fucked this wasp up quick.

4730
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:08,220
The Wasp is walking around.

4731
02:14:08,221 --> 02:14:08,610
It's too,

4732
02:14:08,610 --> 02:14:09,360
it's pretty dope.

4733
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:11,400
I wish we could show it and
not get pulled off of youtube.

4734
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:14,100
Whatever happens to those
when we get pulled over those.

4735
02:14:14,100 --> 02:14:14,400
Jamey,

4736
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:15,233
do we get back on?

4737
02:14:16,170 --> 02:14:17,003
Yes and no?

4738
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:17,881
Yes and no.

4739
02:14:17,881 --> 02:14:18,960
This is worth watching,

4740
02:14:18,961 --> 02:14:19,794
dude.

4741
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:20,873
Look at this one.

4742
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:22,081
Yeah,

4743
02:14:22,081 --> 02:14:22,914
that's the one I'm watching.

4744
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:23,953
Praying masters.

4745
02:14:24,790 --> 02:14:25,880
I think we could make,

4746
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:30,840
well I'm praying mantises are gangster.

4747
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:32,310
They fuck wasps.

4748
02:14:32,870 --> 02:14:34,320
The wasp don't have a chance.

4749
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:36,150
He just holds them and starts eating them.

4750
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:36,541
That's,

4751
02:14:36,541 --> 02:14:37,261
it's really crazy.

4752
02:14:37,261 --> 02:14:38,190
They're so strong.

4753
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:40,050
They just eat the wasps back.

4754
02:14:40,770 --> 02:14:41,930
Just hang on and them.

4755
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:43,291
Yeah.

4756
02:14:43,291 --> 02:14:44,520
That's a fucking vicious,

4757
02:14:44,521 --> 02:14:45,360
vicious animal.

4758
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:47,550
The world of those,

4759
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:50,580
those creatures is just so evil and alien.

4760
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:53,190
We just don't think about
it cause they're so small.

4761
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:53,870
Yeah.

4762
02:14:53,870 --> 02:14:54,581
Their level.

4763
02:14:54,581 --> 02:14:56,350
It's like ruthless people.

4764
02:14:56,380 --> 02:14:57,131
Like not people,

4765
02:14:57,131 --> 02:14:58,210
but the other animals are like,

4766
02:14:58,470 --> 02:14:59,920
they run scared.

4767
02:15:00,310 --> 02:15:04,750
But for us it's like a pair of vans
can just take them both out at once.

4768
02:15:05,140 --> 02:15:05,531
Yeah.

4769
02:15:05,531 --> 02:15:09,550
They're these other bees or
swimming or a flying round.

4770
02:15:09,551 --> 02:15:10,161
This praying man.

4771
02:15:10,161 --> 02:15:11,550
It's not sure how to save their friend,

4772
02:15:11,551 --> 02:15:16,120
but they don't know what to do while
this wasp is getting eaten alive,

4773
02:15:16,540 --> 02:15:17,800
eating the back of his head.

4774
02:15:18,220 --> 02:15:19,060
It's horrific,

4775
02:15:19,061 --> 02:15:19,894
man.

4776
02:15:19,990 --> 02:15:21,820
He's just holding onto
it and just eating it.

4777
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:23,530
We just,

4778
02:15:23,530 --> 02:15:23,951
we're,

4779
02:15:23,951 --> 02:15:27,640
we're looking at it in this tiny scale
so it doesn't seem that horrific.

4780
02:15:27,910 --> 02:15:31,180
But if a praying mantis
is a size of a Giraffe,

4781
02:15:32,530 --> 02:15:33,363
you know,

4782
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:38,840
and we saw it chase after a hippo and
jacket and it was fucking up this hippo in

4783
02:15:39,191 --> 02:15:42,040
front of all the other hippos and there
wasn't a God damn thing they could do

4784
02:15:42,041 --> 02:15:42,371
about it.

4785
02:15:42,371 --> 02:15:46,510
They just had to sit there and just deal
with the fact had this huge mechanized

4786
02:15:46,511 --> 02:15:47,440
looking beach

4787
02:15:50,050 --> 02:15:51,710
taking chunks out of the hippos head

4788
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:54,240
and they're like,

4789
02:15:54,240 --> 02:15:54,841
oh fuck.

4790
02:15:54,841 --> 02:15:56,430
Do we go over there and save him?

4791
02:15:56,431 --> 02:15:57,480
What do we do?

4792
02:15:57,800 --> 02:16:02,800
That's why I like size is in the animal
kingdom is so relevant because when you

4793
02:16:03,081 --> 02:16:04,040
get really low,

4794
02:16:04,041 --> 02:16:04,521
wow,

4795
02:16:04,521 --> 02:16:06,560
there's a pre masters Jack that be,

4796
02:16:08,150 --> 02:16:08,600
they don't

4797
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:09,530
play games,

4798
02:16:09,531 --> 02:16:09,950
man.

4799
02:16:09,950 --> 02:16:10,970
They don't play games.

4800
02:16:11,270 --> 02:16:12,350
They're so strong.

4801
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,900
They just hold onto the
beach and start eating them.

4802
02:16:15,820 --> 02:16:16,910
Is that his death rattle?

4803
02:16:17,090 --> 02:16:17,241
Yeah.

4804
02:16:17,241 --> 02:16:18,500
He's just trying to fly away.

4805
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:20,600
He's trying to fly away.

4806
02:16:20,750 --> 02:16:22,700
Look how much stronger those things are.

4807
02:16:22,970 --> 02:16:24,740
That's like he plants his leg,

4808
02:16:24,770 --> 02:16:26,570
John Jones versus Bobby Lee.

4809
02:16:27,200 --> 02:16:28,033
That's what,

4810
02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:29,320
that's what that's like.

4811
02:16:29,670 --> 02:16:30,190
That's,

4812
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:31,780
that's what kind of a battle that is.

4813
02:16:32,020 --> 02:16:32,711
Just holds them.

4814
02:16:32,711 --> 02:16:33,431
It doesn't matter what he does.

4815
02:16:33,431 --> 02:16:34,330
You're not going anywhere.

4816
02:16:35,060 --> 02:16:35,893
Wow.

4817
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:38,940
And this a praying mantis
is a mother fucker,

4818
02:16:38,941 --> 02:16:39,774
man.

4819
02:16:41,140 --> 02:16:44,030
Just hold on home and starts eating the,

4820
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:44,761
yeah,

4821
02:16:44,761 --> 02:16:45,720
that's a weird world.

4822
02:16:45,721 --> 02:16:46,381
It's just tiny,

4823
02:16:46,381 --> 02:16:46,651
tiny,

4824
02:16:46,651 --> 02:16:47,031
tiny seed.

4825
02:16:47,031 --> 02:16:47,864
We don't freak,

4826
02:16:48,330 --> 02:16:49,170
but if it was big,

4827
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:51,090
it would be way more ruthless
than what we're seeing.

4828
02:16:51,091 --> 02:16:52,620
Like even amongst mammals,

4829
02:16:52,650 --> 02:16:53,880
like Predator mammals,

4830
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:56,430
when we see like a lion
take out a gazelle,

4831
02:16:56,431 --> 02:17:00,420
like I guess that's not as creepy
to me because they're mammals.

4832
02:17:01,910 --> 02:17:02,743
Yeah.

4833
02:17:02,750 --> 02:17:06,680
If I saw a giant praying
mantis take out a gazelle,

4834
02:17:06,681 --> 02:17:07,850
I'd be way more freaked out.

4835
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,540
The way they look at it looks more alien.

4836
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:12,903
Yeah,

4837
02:17:13,230 --> 02:17:14,063
they're weird.

4838
02:17:14,180 --> 02:17:18,290
Bugged out eyes and they're crazy arms
and their antenna that gets some kind of

4839
02:17:18,291 --> 02:17:19,640
weird internet.

4840
02:17:19,730 --> 02:17:20,241
All of it,

4841
02:17:20,241 --> 02:17:21,074
man.

4842
02:17:21,320 --> 02:17:24,910
If a praying mantis didn't
exist and you got to see this,

4843
02:17:24,911 --> 02:17:25,281
you'd be like,

4844
02:17:25,281 --> 02:17:25,580
oh,

4845
02:17:25,580 --> 02:17:28,700
what if this was a character in a movie?

4846
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:30,600
Like what planet is this on?

4847
02:17:30,680 --> 02:17:31,250
Yeah.

4848
02:17:31,250 --> 02:17:32,840
That easily could be.

4849
02:17:32,870 --> 02:17:33,740
If it was large,

4850
02:17:33,770 --> 02:17:37,160
it could be an alien in a
movie like the movie alien.

4851
02:17:37,161 --> 02:17:38,260
If that thing was chasing you,

4852
02:17:38,300 --> 02:17:39,410
that'd be just as scary.

4853
02:17:39,470 --> 02:17:39,980
Oh yeah.

4854
02:17:39,980 --> 02:17:42,050
Big giant ass fucking crab arms.

4855
02:17:42,051 --> 02:17:46,190
It's going to clamp a hold their pride
designed after the praying mantis.

4856
02:17:46,420 --> 02:17:47,750
I've some animal like that.

4857
02:17:47,900 --> 02:17:48,201
Yeah,

4858
02:17:48,201 --> 02:17:52,250
I bet there's probably definitely some
influence those cause if you think about

4859
02:17:52,251 --> 02:17:53,120
like bugs,

4860
02:17:53,450 --> 02:17:56,450
bugs are just like what those
aliens were like the alien.

4861
02:17:56,450 --> 02:17:58,400
They were like this emotionless,

4862
02:17:58,401 --> 02:17:59,960
ruthless thing.

4863
02:17:59,961 --> 02:18:03,050
They just like started of popped out of
the darkness and clamped a hold of you

4864
02:18:03,051 --> 02:18:06,570
and fucking shot a tongue and
your brains sucked your brain.

4865
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:08,930
How is that any different than
when we just saw that thing?

4866
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:10,710
Yeah.

4867
02:18:10,710 --> 02:18:14,520
You don't see any humanity because the
eyes don't look the same that Matt like

4868
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:16,940
you can't like identify with it.

4869
02:18:16,941 --> 02:18:21,941
You're like this is a foreign species
and this giant is coming at me to rip my

4870
02:18:22,131 --> 02:18:23,090
heart out of my chest.

4871
02:18:23,850 --> 02:18:24,470
Yeah.

4872
02:18:24,470 --> 02:18:25,850
That's kind of exactly what it is.

4873
02:18:25,851 --> 02:18:29,630
Like the difference between when
we see like a cat eat a gazelle,

4874
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:31,760
you know when you see a cat,

4875
02:18:31,790 --> 02:18:32,031
wow.

4876
02:18:32,031 --> 02:18:34,550
What is this madness versus hummingbird?

4877
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:35,061
No.

4878
02:18:35,061 --> 02:18:35,894
Why?

4879
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:38,933
Okay.

4880
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:39,971
What happens?

4881
02:18:39,971 --> 02:18:40,840
There's just three of them.

4882
02:18:40,860 --> 02:18:43,210
Well praying mantises
kill hummingbirds dude.

4883
02:18:43,780 --> 02:18:44,350
Really?

4884
02:18:44,350 --> 02:18:44,651
Yeah.

4885
02:18:44,651 --> 02:18:46,240
So hummingbirds are scared of him.

4886
02:18:46,780 --> 02:18:47,321
There's a,

4887
02:18:47,321 --> 02:18:50,890
there's a video of a hummingbird
with a praying man is in his mouth.

4888
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:52,600
It's really fucked.

4889
02:18:53,830 --> 02:18:56,170
Or a praying mantis with a
hummingbird in his mouth.

4890
02:18:56,250 --> 02:18:56,740
Looks site.

4891
02:18:56,740 --> 02:18:59,020
They jacked him there are super small.

4892
02:18:59,021 --> 02:19:00,010
So they attacked him.

4893
02:19:00,011 --> 02:19:04,980
Where did they attack him or hearings
and those things are fucking aliens to

4894
02:19:04,981 --> 02:19:06,130
awesome hummingbirds.

4895
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:06,431
Yeah,

4896
02:19:06,431 --> 02:19:07,360
they're beautiful.

4897
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:08,740
Where's he jack them?

4898
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:08,981
You know,

4899
02:19:08,981 --> 02:19:11,920
the smallest hummingbird
is the size of a dime.

4900
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:13,300
Really?

4901
02:19:13,300 --> 02:19:13,481
Yeah.

4902
02:19:13,481 --> 02:19:14,314
I saw one.

4903
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:15,970
I went to,

4904
02:19:15,970 --> 02:19:17,740
I did a dissection.

4905
02:19:18,210 --> 02:19:19,330
Ah Shit.

4906
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:20,081
Oh Dude.

4907
02:19:20,081 --> 02:19:21,730
The gas wins.

4908
02:19:21,790 --> 02:19:22,780
Holy Cow.

4909
02:19:25,270 --> 02:19:25,931
Look at this.

4910
02:19:25,931 --> 02:19:29,720
It's waiting and the hummingbird gets
close and when the hummingbird goes

4911
02:19:29,721 --> 02:19:30,470
through the food,

4912
02:19:30,470 --> 02:19:31,640
it attacks a hummingbird.

4913
02:19:31,641 --> 02:19:32,171
Watch this.

4914
02:19:32,171 --> 02:19:32,790
This is crazy,

4915
02:19:32,790 --> 02:19:33,430
dad.

4916
02:19:33,430 --> 02:19:34,263
I'll get this

4917
02:19:36,580 --> 02:19:37,450
swap.

4918
02:19:37,750 --> 02:19:38,370
Ah,

4919
02:19:38,370 --> 02:19:39,400
look at his bank.

4920
02:19:39,450 --> 02:19:40,330
Took him down.

4921
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:41,680
It was a suicide bomber.

4922
02:19:41,950 --> 02:19:42,940
That's crazy.

4923
02:19:42,941 --> 02:19:45,120
That's crazy.

4924
02:19:45,430 --> 02:19:45,840
Yeah.

4925
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:46,300
That's what,

4926
02:19:46,300 --> 02:19:46,961
that's how scary.

4927
02:19:46,961 --> 02:19:47,530
Those things are.

4928
02:19:47,530 --> 02:19:48,520
Things bigger than him.

4929
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:49,390
Okay.

4930
02:19:49,390 --> 02:19:50,980
Fuck funny.

4931
02:19:50,981 --> 02:19:51,251
Praying.

4932
02:19:51,251 --> 02:19:53,170
Mantises they did it
more threatening name.

4933
02:19:53,350 --> 02:19:54,050
Yeah.

4934
02:19:54,050 --> 02:19:54,883
Right.

4935
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:57,120
Cause it stands weird.

4936
02:19:57,190 --> 02:19:58,870
It's also killed hummingbirds.

4937
02:19:59,110 --> 02:20:00,970
Well it's the prey is p.

4938
02:20:00,971 --> 02:20:01,690
R.

4939
02:20:01,690 --> 02:20:01,690
E.

4940
02:20:01,690 --> 02:20:01,691
Y.

4941
02:20:01,691 --> 02:20:03,400
It's not like praying mantis.

4942
02:20:03,460 --> 02:20:04,420
I think it is a why.

4943
02:20:04,421 --> 02:20:04,780
Right?

4944
02:20:04,780 --> 02:20:06,880
Is it because they did
the way that they yeah.

4945
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:07,150
Yeah.

4946
02:20:07,150 --> 02:20:07,331
Oh,

4947
02:20:07,331 --> 02:20:08,520
it is the way they stand.

4948
02:20:08,521 --> 02:20:08,920
Yeah.

4949
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:10,300
I always thought it was praying.

4950
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:11,010
Yeah,

4951
02:20:11,010 --> 02:20:11,690
because of what I mean.

4952
02:20:11,690 --> 02:20:12,523
Yeah.

4953
02:20:13,240 --> 02:20:13,451
Yeah.

4954
02:20:13,451 --> 02:20:15,700
It would suck if they spelled
it pray and they were just,

4955
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:18,513
no,

4956
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:19,420
no.

4957
02:20:19,420 --> 02:20:21,070
The only tag a fucking snake.

4958
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:22,000
Oh my God.

4959
02:20:22,001 --> 02:20:22,360
No,

4960
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:23,193
no way.

4961
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:24,513
Snake.

4962
02:20:26,670 --> 02:20:26,851
Yeah.

4963
02:20:26,851 --> 02:20:27,990
If we get kicked off of Youtube,

4964
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:30,120
fuck fucking planet.

4965
02:20:30,700 --> 02:20:31,940
I'm tired of this shit.

4966
02:20:32,030 --> 02:20:33,720
[inaudible] has also led a,

4967
02:20:33,730 --> 02:20:35,460
the the dude's to Bethlehem.

4968
02:20:35,461 --> 02:20:36,000
I remember.

4969
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,700
If I remember you making shit up now.

4970
02:20:38,701 --> 02:20:39,560
I think that's a real,

4971
02:20:40,300 --> 02:20:41,040
a praying mantis.

4972
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:42,040
Jackson's snake,

4973
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:44,760
a corn snake about 10 inches in length.

4974
02:20:44,850 --> 02:20:46,530
That's about what size my Dixon.

4975
02:20:47,930 --> 02:20:50,100
We'll just keep on
pushing it back and forth.

4976
02:20:50,610 --> 02:20:51,990
Confused a little.

4977
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:55,190
Are you trying to trick the algorithm?

4978
02:20:55,350 --> 02:20:56,183
I ain't going to work.

4979
02:20:56,500 --> 02:20:57,710
Fucking negative bitch.

4980
02:20:57,730 --> 02:20:57,871
Yeah.

4981
02:20:57,871 --> 02:20:58,704
Put it negative.

4982
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:01,010
What did we just see?

4983
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:01,610
Whoa.

4984
02:21:01,610 --> 02:21:02,870
You turn that back to regular.

4985
02:21:03,470 --> 02:21:05,330
I need to see what his approach was.

4986
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:05,920
Well,

4987
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:07,840
he's upside down by demanding it.

4988
02:21:07,970 --> 02:21:09,080
That's insane.

4989
02:21:09,081 --> 02:21:13,430
He's upside down and he reached
down and snatched a snake.

4990
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,100
They're so evil fro critical.

4991
02:21:16,730 --> 02:21:21,190
This snake isn't capable of free itself
from the grip of this 16 inch from that

4992
02:21:21,191 --> 02:21:21,620
office.

4993
02:21:21,620 --> 02:21:22,700
That's amazing.

4994
02:21:22,701 --> 02:21:25,780
Danger of being eaten
alive by being insect.

4995
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:29,930
That's amazing.

4996
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:33,800
It's just eating it upside down.

4997
02:21:35,070 --> 02:21:36,650
Look at that poor snake too.

4998
02:21:36,651 --> 02:21:37,071
He's like,

4999
02:21:37,071 --> 02:21:37,880
what the fuck?

5000
02:21:37,880 --> 02:21:38,720
Nobody eats me.

5001
02:21:39,650 --> 02:21:40,251
I'm a snake,

5002
02:21:40,251 --> 02:21:40,670
man.

5003
02:21:40,670 --> 02:21:40,791
Yeah,

5004
02:21:40,791 --> 02:21:42,230
you're supposed to be using your leaf.

5005
02:21:42,231 --> 02:21:43,064
I thought

5006
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:47,740
it's amazing how much
stronger insects are green.

5007
02:21:47,780 --> 02:21:50,360
Mathis loses its oh you pussy corn.

5008
02:21:50,361 --> 02:21:51,350
Snake escapes.

5009
02:21:51,770 --> 02:21:52,910
No Jiu Jitsu.

5010
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:54,010
Bad position.

5011
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:56,860
We didn't hear as a praying mantis.

5012
02:21:56,870 --> 02:21:58,250
Go like go tell your friends.

5013
02:21:58,251 --> 02:21:58,550
Yeah,

5014
02:21:58,550 --> 02:21:59,480
I'm letting you live.

5015
02:21:59,590 --> 02:22:00,280
Yeah,

5016
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:01,290
you have no friends.

5017
02:22:01,490 --> 02:22:02,323
I'm in town,

5018
02:22:02,610 --> 02:22:04,040
man is versus tarantula.

5019
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:08,420
I don't want us praying mantises and
monitor showing off at this point.

5020
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:09,940
I was like praying man.

5021
02:22:09,941 --> 02:22:11,590
His first versus teenage boy.

5022
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:11,901
They're like,

5023
02:22:11,901 --> 02:22:14,090
well no putting minutes versus

5024
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:17,540
very praying mantis versus kitten.

5025
02:22:17,541 --> 02:22:18,374
I bet that's out there.

5026
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:19,750
Oh that would be great.

5027
02:22:20,180 --> 02:22:21,050
I bet it's out there.

5028
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:21,770
Is it out there?

5029
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:22,280
Yeah.

5030
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:23,870
Shit versus,

5031
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:24,290
yeah,

5032
02:22:24,290 --> 02:22:25,123
I gotta wash that.

5033
02:22:25,470 --> 02:22:26,400
How's that possible?

5034
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:27,473
That's nuts.

5035
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:30,300
So the idea is that it's hands are out.

5036
02:22:30,301 --> 02:22:31,021
Like it's praying.

5037
02:22:31,021 --> 02:22:31,640
Like it's like,

5038
02:22:31,640 --> 02:22:32,473
oh,

5039
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:36,500
look at this praying mantis versus
Tarantula Jack to tranche law.

5040
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:37,380
It's saying,

5041
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:38,850
please come fuck with me.

5042
02:22:39,290 --> 02:22:40,590
Holding onto the transla.

5043
02:22:40,830 --> 02:22:43,020
I think once it gets those clamps on you,

5044
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:44,430
all those bugs are fucked.

5045
02:22:44,670 --> 02:22:45,810
They can't do shit about it.

5046
02:22:45,811 --> 02:22:46,950
Once you get those clamps.

5047
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:49,021
That's weird,

5048
02:22:49,021 --> 02:22:49,854
man.

5049
02:22:51,710 --> 02:22:52,543
Wow.

5050
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:54,600
Is that cat one bad night?

5051
02:22:54,810 --> 02:22:55,643
Catlin.

5052
02:22:55,710 --> 02:22:56,543
Really?

5053
02:22:57,780 --> 02:22:59,660
This is crazy how strong the thing is.

5054
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:00,390
Look,

5055
02:23:00,390 --> 02:23:01,440
it just holds on.

5056
02:23:01,470 --> 02:23:01,711
Look,

5057
02:23:01,711 --> 02:23:05,190
it just hooked that fucking praying
mantises head or that a tarantula.

5058
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:07,340
His head and the channel just like,

5059
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:08,281
let me go bitch.

5060
02:23:08,281 --> 02:23:08,550
He's like,

5061
02:23:08,550 --> 02:23:09,330
nope,

5062
02:23:09,330 --> 02:23:10,440
there's so much stronger.

5063
02:23:10,441 --> 02:23:10,591
Look,

5064
02:23:10,591 --> 02:23:11,424
it's just eating it.

5065
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:13,050
Biting its legs and Shit.

5066
02:23:13,110 --> 02:23:14,280
They're praying for mercy.

5067
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:14,851
Oh,

5068
02:23:14,851 --> 02:23:16,500
but turn around so it turns it around.

5069
02:23:16,501 --> 02:23:17,334
Whoa.

5070
02:23:17,460 --> 02:23:18,540
Oh,

5071
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:20,490
you got jack son over.

5072
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:21,533
He's jacked.

5073
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:21,781
Look,

5074
02:23:21,781 --> 02:23:22,710
he's upside down.

5075
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:24,000
Writhing in pain.

5076
02:23:24,330 --> 02:23:24,930
Oh,

5077
02:23:24,930 --> 02:23:25,711
is that the end?

5078
02:23:25,711 --> 02:23:26,070
Yeah.

5079
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:26,903
What the fuck?

5080
02:23:27,090 --> 02:23:29,940
Who shut the video of
their guy's an asshole.

5081
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:30,990
That board at that point.

5082
02:23:30,991 --> 02:23:31,824
That's like the hut.

5083
02:23:33,170 --> 02:23:33,871
Is this a part?

5084
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:35,460
One of a 10 part trailer?

5085
02:23:35,461 --> 02:23:36,294
Yeah.

5086
02:23:36,390 --> 02:23:37,320
Two hours later.

5087
02:23:38,010 --> 02:23:39,630
Grampian versus turning Japanese.

5088
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:40,621
You know what?

5089
02:23:40,621 --> 02:23:42,030
What Japanese bug fight stuff.

5090
02:23:42,031 --> 02:23:44,970
Can you look up what the
praying Mantis is afraid of?

5091
02:23:45,160 --> 02:23:45,810
Who Prep?

5092
02:23:45,810 --> 02:23:46,643
Pull up the praying.

5093
02:23:46,820 --> 02:23:48,240
Praying mantis versus kitten.

5094
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:49,470
This is awesome.

5095
02:23:49,660 --> 02:23:49,800
No,

5096
02:23:49,800 --> 02:23:49,901
no,

5097
02:23:49,901 --> 02:23:50,041
no.

5098
02:23:50,041 --> 02:23:50,521
Don't worry.

5099
02:23:50,521 --> 02:23:50,911
Don't worry.

5100
02:23:50,911 --> 02:23:51,241
Kittens.

5101
02:23:51,241 --> 02:23:51,840
Fine.

5102
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:52,520
I got it.

5103
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:53,820
It's wild to see man.

5104
02:23:53,821 --> 02:23:54,960
It's wild to see you.

5105
02:23:54,961 --> 02:23:56,360
See how gangster a praying man.

5106
02:23:56,361 --> 02:23:57,194
It's really is.

5107
02:23:58,750 --> 02:24:00,340
That's how you see how gangster they are.

5108
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:01,753
Put that.

5109
02:24:01,830 --> 02:24:02,031

5110
02:24:02,031 --> 02:24:02,141

5111
02:24:02,141 --> 02:24:02,261
no.

5112
02:24:02,261 --> 02:24:02,560
This,

5113
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:03,393
this one.

5114
02:24:03,430 --> 02:24:03,971
This one here.

5115
02:24:03,971 --> 02:24:05,530
Praying mantis boxing.

5116
02:24:05,531 --> 02:24:06,940
Praying mantis versus kitten.

5117
02:24:07,750 --> 02:24:08,081
Sorry.

5118
02:24:08,081 --> 02:24:08,770
This one.

5119
02:24:08,770 --> 02:24:09,520
Boxing.

5120
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:09,881
Yeah.

5121
02:24:09,881 --> 02:24:10,631
You got to see this.

5122
02:24:10,631 --> 02:24:11,710
This is so ridiculous.

5123
02:24:11,711 --> 02:24:12,760
Like they're going to war.

5124
02:24:13,030 --> 02:24:16,270
The kitten and the pragmatics are
fucking throwing down to the death.

5125
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:16,931
Yeah.

5126
02:24:16,931 --> 02:24:17,950
This is a look at this.

5127
02:24:18,430 --> 02:24:19,930
This is fucking praying mantis.

5128
02:24:20,650 --> 02:24:21,880
He's not scared of Shit.

5129
02:24:21,881 --> 02:24:23,020
That kitten fucks him up.

5130
02:24:23,050 --> 02:24:23,291
Bitch.

5131
02:24:23,291 --> 02:24:24,124
What bitch?

5132
02:24:24,740 --> 02:24:25,220
Swat.

5133
02:24:25,220 --> 02:24:25,890
Swat.

5134
02:24:25,890 --> 02:24:27,280
But look at him and he's still up.

5135
02:24:27,320 --> 02:24:28,630
Still swinging at the kittens.

5136
02:24:28,990 --> 02:24:30,350
The kitten doesn't know when to bite him.

5137
02:24:31,630 --> 02:24:32,441
He's scared to bite him.

5138
02:24:32,441 --> 02:24:33,274
Look at them.

5139
02:24:34,370 --> 02:24:35,120
Fuck him up.

5140
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:35,691
No pop,

5141
02:24:35,691 --> 02:24:35,931
pop,

5142
02:24:35,931 --> 02:24:36,141
pop,

5143
02:24:36,141 --> 02:24:36,974
pop.

5144
02:24:37,950 --> 02:24:39,480
Look how tough a praying man this is.

5145
02:24:39,481 --> 02:24:42,330
It takes a blow to the head by
something way bigger than it.

5146
02:24:44,390 --> 02:24:46,400
Who is that guy speaking?

5147
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:47,273
Mood.

5148
02:24:49,050 --> 02:24:49,381
Okay.

5149
02:24:49,381 --> 02:24:50,280
Don't do that Brian.

5150
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:52,020
You ruined the performance.

5151
02:24:53,330 --> 02:24:56,400
This cat's doing a great job
praying masters all fucked up.

5152
02:24:56,490 --> 02:24:57,450
Just standing eight count.

5153
02:24:57,720 --> 02:25:00,030
Oh it goes right back to boom body slam.

5154
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:00,953
We can jump.

5155
02:25:01,950 --> 02:25:02,790
That wasn't a jump.

5156
02:25:02,791 --> 02:25:03,780
That cat bit him in the head.

5157
02:25:04,990 --> 02:25:05,560
Okay,

5158
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:05,871
look at him.

5159
02:25:05,871 --> 02:25:07,180
He's still fighting back though.

5160
02:25:07,720 --> 02:25:08,201
It's crazy.

5161
02:25:08,201 --> 02:25:11,740
And the cat is obviously scared of
him a little bit because he's so fast.

5162
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:12,401
Oh,

5163
02:25:12,401 --> 02:25:13,234
another bike.

5164
02:25:13,720 --> 02:25:14,800
You're fucked up son.

5165
02:25:14,801 --> 02:25:16,360
I didn't know they had
like wings like that.

5166
02:25:16,390 --> 02:25:17,020
Yeah,

5167
02:25:17,020 --> 02:25:17,853
look at that thing.

5168
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:20,680
What a creepy ass alien bug.

5169
02:25:21,220 --> 02:25:21,990
1000000th.

5170
02:25:21,990 --> 02:25:22,980
The size of that cat.

5171
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:24,190
It's still fighting back.

5172
02:25:25,990 --> 02:25:26,830
Oh Shit.

5173
02:25:26,950 --> 02:25:31,390
How many praying men and body
wastes and body body weight.

5174
02:25:31,750 --> 02:25:32,421
How many praying man,

5175
02:25:32,421 --> 02:25:32,711
this is,

5176
02:25:32,711 --> 02:25:34,000
does it take to equal that cat?

5177
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:38,020
My Cat's about 10 pounds.

5178
02:25:38,220 --> 02:25:38,830
Yeah.

5179
02:25:38,830 --> 02:25:41,620
Praying Mantis is about two ounces.

5180
02:25:41,860 --> 02:25:43,720
So 16 ounces is a pound.

5181
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:44,801
Yeah,

5182
02:25:44,801 --> 02:25:45,790
that's a lot bigger

5183
02:25:47,810 --> 02:25:49,010
cause the mathematics

5184
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:50,630
it did.

5185
02:25:50,630 --> 02:25:51,490
He's just jacked it.

5186
02:25:51,491 --> 02:25:52,390
It's down now.

5187
02:25:52,570 --> 02:25:53,680
He must've been it in the head.

5188
02:25:54,370 --> 02:25:54,791
Now he's like,

5189
02:25:54,791 --> 02:25:55,110
what?

5190
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:55,590
Bitch?

5191
02:25:55,590 --> 02:25:56,560
It's on his back again,

5192
02:25:57,400 --> 02:25:57,920
bitch,

5193
02:25:57,920 --> 02:25:58,753
bitch,

5194
02:25:59,630 --> 02:26:00,390
bitch,

5195
02:26:00,390 --> 02:26:00,700
bitch.

5196
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:02,470
That's why you and your head bitch pop.

5197
02:26:03,090 --> 02:26:05,170
The praying Mantis is
still trying to fight back

5198
02:26:06,900 --> 02:26:10,290
the camera to widen out and there's just
like a circle of like Filipino dudes

5199
02:26:10,291 --> 02:26:11,640
like betting money on the whole thing.

5200
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:12,220
Yeah,

5201
02:26:12,220 --> 02:26:13,810
probably right.

5202
02:26:14,890 --> 02:26:16,060
That's a good thing to bet on.

5203
02:26:16,210 --> 02:26:18,370
Like how long a praying
mantis last with a cat?

5204
02:26:18,470 --> 02:26:18,830
Yeah.

5205
02:26:18,830 --> 02:26:20,680
I had no idea until this podcast.

5206
02:26:20,681 --> 02:26:22,030
How gangster praying mantises where

5207
02:26:22,150 --> 02:26:25,690
I know I want to know like
taking my know who who,

5208
02:26:25,810 --> 02:26:28,810
who preys on the praying mantis
like who's their predator?

5209
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:30,790
Like their direct predator.

5210
02:26:30,791 --> 02:26:31,601
That's a good question.

5211
02:26:31,601 --> 02:26:33,160
Predator to the praying mantis.

5212
02:26:33,290 --> 02:26:33,580
I,

5213
02:26:33,580 --> 02:26:36,520
here's a mouse versus a
fucking praying mantis.

5214
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:41,740
That's gotta be some kind of bird
that's like tougher than hummingbird.

5215
02:26:42,100 --> 02:26:42,920
Hmm.

5216
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:43,460
Yeah.

5217
02:26:43,460 --> 02:26:45,770
What are the enemies of a praying mantis?

5218
02:26:45,970 --> 02:26:46,230
Okay,

5219
02:26:46,230 --> 02:26:46,920
let's find out.

5220
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:48,110
Can I check this out real quick?

5221
02:26:48,290 --> 02:26:50,360
Cause I don't want to say too
much of this video because it's,

5222
02:26:50,450 --> 02:26:51,283
they look,

5223
02:26:53,870 --> 02:26:54,171
oh,

5224
02:26:54,171 --> 02:26:55,370
we jacked a mouse.

5225
02:26:55,820 --> 02:26:56,870
That's incredible.

5226
02:26:57,440 --> 02:26:58,490
Fucking crazy.

5227
02:26:59,240 --> 02:26:59,720
God.

5228
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:01,130
Show that again dude.

5229
02:27:01,220 --> 02:27:02,060
Shut that again.

5230
02:27:02,480 --> 02:27:03,410
I don't care if they pull us off.

5231
02:27:03,420 --> 02:27:03,870
You

5232
02:27:03,870 --> 02:27:04,700
see this,

5233
02:27:04,700 --> 02:27:05,530
look at this,

5234
02:27:05,530 --> 02:27:06,363
this mouse.

5235
02:27:07,430 --> 02:27:08,263
It doesn't move.

5236
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:14,593
Wow.

5237
02:27:17,710 --> 02:27:18,543
Oh,

5238
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:22,900
the mouse soon draws its last breath.

5239
02:27:23,620 --> 02:27:24,430
It's an odd site

5240
02:27:24,430 --> 02:27:26,670
to watch an insect devouring a memo.

5241
02:27:27,780 --> 02:27:28,540
Yes.

5242
02:27:28,540 --> 02:27:28,860
Yeah,

5243
02:27:28,860 --> 02:27:29,693
it is.

5244
02:27:30,330 --> 02:27:33,030
That's the most gangster
insect in the insect world,

5245
02:27:33,210 --> 02:27:33,780
period.

5246
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:34,613
It's gotta be,

5247
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:35,251
it's gotta be,

5248
02:27:35,251 --> 02:27:35,401
I mean,

5249
02:27:35,401 --> 02:27:36,360
it doesn't have any venom.

5250
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:38,310
It's doing all this shit with no venom.

5251
02:27:38,670 --> 02:27:38,911
Yeah.

5252
02:27:38,911 --> 02:27:41,040
It's got like those big praying man,

5253
02:27:41,041 --> 02:27:42,040
his hands or whatever.

5254
02:27:42,110 --> 02:27:45,200
It's essentially just doing
Jujitsu and eating it.

5255
02:27:45,350 --> 02:27:46,100
Yeah.

5256
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:47,960
He just does Jujitsu and
then just starts eating.

5257
02:27:48,320 --> 02:27:50,750
He holds them in side control
and just eat the shit out of him.

5258
02:27:51,530 --> 02:27:52,320
Wow.

5259
02:27:52,320 --> 02:27:52,920
Hey,

5260
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:55,650
it's weird because the
one that was on my patio,

5261
02:27:55,740 --> 02:27:59,430
it was right next to where I was
sitting the whole day and wing it.

5262
02:27:59,431 --> 02:27:59,881
You know,

5263
02:27:59,881 --> 02:28:00,810
it just stared at me.

5264
02:28:00,811 --> 02:28:04,230
His head would like look like when
like my girlfriend came outside,

5265
02:28:04,330 --> 02:28:06,900
it would look over at my girlfriend
and then looked back at me,

5266
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:08,730
but like I would walk next to it.

5267
02:28:08,731 --> 02:28:09,720
It never flew away.

5268
02:28:09,721 --> 02:28:10,810
Never move.

5269
02:28:10,811 --> 02:28:11,160
Yeah.

5270
02:28:11,160 --> 02:28:11,993
Yeah.

5271
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:12,900
The only thing I've,

5272
02:28:12,900 --> 02:28:13,230
uh,

5273
02:28:13,230 --> 02:28:15,810
the dog started like it's
trying to sniff it and it,

5274
02:28:15,811 --> 02:28:16,740
and it kind of looked down.

5275
02:28:16,780 --> 02:28:17,910
I like get away from me.

5276
02:28:18,060 --> 02:28:19,170
It was probably one or two.

5277
02:28:20,550 --> 02:28:21,920
It's probably looking at you in the

5278
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,750
fucking stupid later.

5279
02:28:23,751 --> 02:28:25,940
It's like boxing an oak
tree or something like that.

5280
02:28:25,941 --> 02:28:26,774
Like working out.

5281
02:28:27,110 --> 02:28:27,531
It was like,

5282
02:28:27,531 --> 02:28:28,730
I think he's vulnerable.

5283
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:29,120
He just,

5284
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:30,200
I feel like I could get them,

5285
02:28:30,201 --> 02:28:32,180
but just not quite big enough.

5286
02:28:33,670 --> 02:28:34,040
Yeah.

5287
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:34,873
Come on man.

5288
02:28:34,990 --> 02:28:36,430
They're getting into modeling at that.

5289
02:28:36,650 --> 02:28:37,483
They're modeling,

5290
02:28:39,380 --> 02:28:41,000
they're breaking into entertainment.

5291
02:28:41,610 --> 02:28:42,443
That's dance.

5292
02:28:43,550 --> 02:28:44,630
Progressive Dance.

5293
02:28:44,930 --> 02:28:45,351
That's it.

5294
02:28:45,351 --> 02:28:46,280
Put that picture up again,

5295
02:28:46,281 --> 02:28:46,730
man.

5296
02:28:46,730 --> 02:28:49,610
The next thing that we'll look
at the body on that thing.

5297
02:28:49,611 --> 02:28:50,870
It's so weird.

5298
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:56,180
What a strange animal and how horrific
would that be if that thing was like

5299
02:28:56,181 --> 02:28:59,030
horse sized and just chasing after you.

5300
02:28:59,540 --> 02:29:01,580
That's it going like now what bitch?

5301
02:29:01,581 --> 02:29:02,960
Like the something on the ground.

5302
02:29:03,350 --> 02:29:04,340
Fucking mouse.

5303
02:29:04,430 --> 02:29:06,500
Do you imagine the physical
strength to one of those things?

5304
02:29:06,501 --> 02:29:07,670
It was like the size of a horse.

5305
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:08,450
Oh yeah,

5306
02:29:08,450 --> 02:29:09,283
dude.

5307
02:29:09,610 --> 02:29:09,801
It would,

5308
02:29:09,801 --> 02:29:12,510
they'd be tearing apart
cars when I was like,

5309
02:29:12,530 --> 02:29:13,400
I'm going to hide my car.

5310
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:14,070
No,

5311
02:29:14,070 --> 02:29:15,530
they just rent the car open.

5312
02:29:15,531 --> 02:29:15,860
Easy.

5313
02:29:15,860 --> 02:29:16,820
That's the one that was yours.

5314
02:29:17,420 --> 02:29:18,253
Look at a man.

5315
02:29:18,570 --> 02:29:18,890
Evil.

5316
02:29:18,890 --> 02:29:20,660
Fucking crazy.

5317
02:29:20,990 --> 02:29:22,610
We're just so lucky that they're little.

5318
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:24,860
They're like the bugs
from starship troopers,

5319
02:29:24,861 --> 02:29:25,694
right?

5320
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:26,001
Yeah,

5321
02:29:26,001 --> 02:29:26,520
kind of.

5322
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:31,110
That's like the best analogy
or the best look like him.

5323
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:33,200
They had it in model like directly after.

5324
02:29:33,230 --> 02:29:33,831
Oh yeah,

5325
02:29:33,831 --> 02:29:34,371
for sure.

5326
02:29:34,371 --> 02:29:35,204
Right.

5327
02:29:35,450 --> 02:29:37,580
The starship trooper
bugs are fucking awesome.

5328
02:29:38,390 --> 02:29:39,500
That was a silly movie.

5329
02:29:39,501 --> 02:29:43,940
But what are you doing Brando before
and after he role in Godfather.

5330
02:29:43,941 --> 02:29:45,260
Before makeup and after makeup.

5331
02:29:45,440 --> 02:29:46,273
Oh really?

5332
02:29:47,030 --> 02:29:47,863
Wow.

5333
02:29:48,050 --> 02:29:49,130
That's amazing.

5334
02:29:49,220 --> 02:29:49,341
Oh,

5335
02:29:49,341 --> 02:29:50,360
so they made him look older.

5336
02:29:50,361 --> 02:29:51,380
I didn't know they did that.

5337
02:29:51,410 --> 02:29:52,071
He almost looked like it.

5338
02:29:52,071 --> 02:29:53,000
Like a George Clooney.

5339
02:29:53,001 --> 02:29:54,470
Brad Pitt Combo right here.

5340
02:29:54,500 --> 02:29:54,591
Oh,

5341
02:29:54,591 --> 02:29:56,060
he was a handsome man when he was young.

5342
02:29:56,990 --> 02:29:57,350
What?

5343
02:29:57,350 --> 02:30:00,350
What does that have anything to do
with what we were talking about?

5344
02:30:01,640 --> 02:30:02,331
God Damn.

5345
02:30:02,331 --> 02:30:03,680
Conversation killing.

5346
02:30:04,970 --> 02:30:09,650
They were talking about a green bug that
destroyed that starship troopers movie

5347
02:30:10,280 --> 02:30:12,080
was a what that would,

5348
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:16,730
that's very realistic in terms of
like if there was an invasion by bugs,

5349
02:30:16,790 --> 02:30:18,050
we would be getting killed.

5350
02:30:18,140 --> 02:30:18,973
Oh yeah.

5351
02:30:19,070 --> 02:30:20,240
If there was bugs like that.

5352
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:24,380
Do we even have like what kind of guns
would it take to shoot down at giant

5353
02:30:24,381 --> 02:30:25,041
praying mantis?

5354
02:30:25,041 --> 02:30:27,440
You'd have to have some
fucking serious fire power,

5355
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:28,970
like a regular rifle.

5356
02:30:28,971 --> 02:30:29,870
It's not going to do it.

5357
02:30:30,350 --> 02:30:32,930
I'll give you shot a shotgun
and a praying mantis.

5358
02:30:33,140 --> 02:30:34,570
The shit would probably work a sheriff,

5359
02:30:34,610 --> 02:30:36,650
but probably I wonder if they were like,

5360
02:30:36,770 --> 02:30:38,240
they're armors and like paneling.

5361
02:30:39,620 --> 02:30:40,453
I don't know if it's like a,

5362
02:30:40,460 --> 02:30:42,740
like an Armadillo is just
like straight through,

5363
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:44,140
but they seem like they have like,

5364
02:30:44,141 --> 02:30:46,790
like Batman has like
panels and move around.

5365
02:30:47,150 --> 02:30:50,870
It seems like that's what they are
like why bet they grow shit back to,

5366
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:55,550
I bet they're like lobsters and a lot of
other bugs when they snap off a wing or

5367
02:30:55,551 --> 02:30:56,121
something like that.

5368
02:30:56,121 --> 02:30:57,170
They just grow it back.

5369
02:30:57,980 --> 02:30:58,813
You took this photo?

5370
02:30:59,810 --> 02:31:00,081
Oh yeah.

5371
02:31:00,081 --> 02:31:02,390
That was the praying mantises in my yard.

5372
02:31:02,391 --> 02:31:03,560
Here's is like Brown.

5373
02:31:03,620 --> 02:31:05,060
That one was like on vacation.

5374
02:31:05,090 --> 02:31:05,940
Well I think he was.

5375
02:31:06,490 --> 02:31:11,490
I think he was being camouflage
or they can change color?

5376
02:31:11,750 --> 02:31:12,583
I'd think so.

5377
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:13,310
Really?

5378
02:31:13,310 --> 02:31:14,091
I didn't know that.

5379
02:31:14,091 --> 02:31:14,661
I think so.

5380
02:31:14,661 --> 02:31:14,991
Okay.

5381
02:31:14,991 --> 02:31:16,160
Can mantas camouflage.

5382
02:31:16,161 --> 02:31:16,994
Let's see.

5383
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:20,273
That'd be cool.

5384
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:21,330
Yup,

5385
02:31:21,330 --> 02:31:22,163
they can.

5386
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:23,180
Wow.

5387
02:31:23,180 --> 02:31:24,050
No idea.

5388
02:31:24,290 --> 02:31:24,800
Yup.

5389
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:26,300
Defense and camouflage.

5390
02:31:26,420 --> 02:31:26,721
Yeah,

5391
02:31:26,721 --> 02:31:27,980
so that's what that thing was doing.

5392
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:31,160
That's what the thing
was doing in my yard.

5393
02:31:31,161 --> 02:31:31,821
If you look at it,

5394
02:31:31,821 --> 02:31:33,050
it's on that stone ball,

5395
02:31:33,051 --> 02:31:37,100
which is the top of a fountain and it's
it blended in to the exact same color.

5396
02:31:37,180 --> 02:31:37,751
Wow.

5397
02:31:37,751 --> 02:31:38,920
That is so cool.

5398
02:31:39,130 --> 02:31:39,963
Yup.

5399
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:41,633
Pretty Weird.

5400
02:31:42,210 --> 02:31:45,450
Praying mantis can camouflage
perfectly into environment of sticks,

5401
02:31:45,451 --> 02:31:45,901
barks,

5402
02:31:45,901 --> 02:31:47,070
leaves and flowers.

5403
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,320
The mantas is almost four inches long,

5404
02:31:49,370 --> 02:31:49,580
blah,

5405
02:31:49,580 --> 02:31:49,771
blah,

5406
02:31:49,771 --> 02:31:50,041
blah,

5407
02:31:50,041 --> 02:31:50,221
blah,

5408
02:31:50,221 --> 02:31:50,461
blah,

5409
02:31:50,461 --> 02:31:50,611
blah,

5410
02:31:50,611 --> 02:31:51,321
blah.

5411
02:31:51,321 --> 02:31:51,620
Mom,

5412
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:56,620
the most evil looking one would be a
red one if it camouflage on the like,

5413
02:31:57,020 --> 02:31:57,291
you know,

5414
02:31:57,291 --> 02:31:58,124
something red.

5415
02:31:58,690 --> 02:32:00,140
It can be crazy eyes.

5416
02:32:00,250 --> 02:32:01,210
They can be green,

5417
02:32:01,211 --> 02:32:01,810
Brown,

5418
02:32:01,810 --> 02:32:04,450
or a combination of colors
to match their environment.

5419
02:32:05,050 --> 02:32:10,000
It will mold every few weeks and then
can take on the colors of its natural

5420
02:32:10,001 --> 02:32:10,840
surroundings.

5421
02:32:10,900 --> 02:32:11,733
Wow.

5422
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:16,120
A praying mantis might even mimic
the charred remains of sticks.

5423
02:32:16,121 --> 02:32:18,520
Weeds or grass after a fire.

5424
02:32:18,830 --> 02:32:19,663
Ooh.

5425
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:20,670
Oh,

5426
02:32:20,670 --> 02:32:21,451
got it.

5427
02:32:21,451 --> 02:32:22,284
Started

5428
02:32:25,350 --> 02:32:28,400
swaying repetitively from side
to side as a common California

5429
02:32:28,460 --> 02:32:28,910
behavior.

5430
02:32:28,910 --> 02:32:32,720
The praying mantis might be used to
mimic the swing movement of vegetation in

5431
02:32:32,721 --> 02:32:33,554
the wind.

5432
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:35,160
Wow.

5433
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:36,480
Where was that?

5434
02:32:36,480 --> 02:32:37,950
This is a video you posted about.

5435
02:32:38,330 --> 02:32:39,560
Oh yeah.

5436
02:32:39,561 --> 02:32:42,110
That was his gangster praying
mantis at the comments.

5437
02:32:47,910 --> 02:32:48,271
Wait a minute.

5438
02:32:48,271 --> 02:32:48,830
What's this?

5439
02:32:48,830 --> 02:32:48,910
Oh,

5440
02:32:48,910 --> 02:32:49,743
this is that.

5441
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:53,100
The parasite Geicos a Zombie praying man.

5442
02:32:53,101 --> 02:32:55,980
It's revealing a huge parasite
living inside of it was,

5443
02:32:56,070 --> 02:32:56,671
oh no,

5444
02:32:56,671 --> 02:32:56,821
no,

5445
02:32:56,821 --> 02:32:56,911
no.

5446
02:32:56,911 --> 02:32:58,080
This is not what I'm talking about.

5447
02:32:58,081 --> 02:32:59,250
I thought this was something else.

5448
02:33:01,720 --> 02:33:01,871
Oh,

5449
02:33:01,871 --> 02:33:02,231
that's right.

5450
02:33:02,231 --> 02:33:04,270
He killed it and there's
something inside of it

5451
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:07,390
that parasite just coming out of it.

5452
02:33:08,410 --> 02:33:09,243
Whoa.

5453
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:10,870
Like a snake inside of it.

5454
02:33:12,290 --> 02:33:12,801
Yeah.

5455
02:33:12,801 --> 02:33:14,090
That's essentially like that movie.

5456
02:33:14,091 --> 02:33:15,350
The strain back then.

5457
02:33:15,351 --> 02:33:16,880
I'm so we could see that
whole thing pop out.

5458
02:33:20,050 --> 02:33:21,640
Oh Jesus Christ.

5459
02:33:21,641 --> 02:33:22,660
That's so weird.

5460
02:33:23,890 --> 02:33:25,450
Welcome to the world of bugs.

5461
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:26,981
This is,

5462
02:33:26,981 --> 02:33:28,300
this episode is Nicu.

5463
02:33:28,301 --> 02:33:29,350
Sif is hilarious.

5464
02:33:29,351 --> 02:33:33,580
And the world of bugs look at
that thing also by my name album.

5465
02:33:33,640 --> 02:33:33,911
Yeah.

5466
02:33:33,911 --> 02:33:37,290
Also buys come album and don't think
about this black dick coming out.

5467
02:33:37,291 --> 02:33:38,200
Oh my God.

5468
02:33:38,380 --> 02:33:38,951
Dead praying,

5469
02:33:38,951 --> 02:33:39,784
man.

5470
02:33:40,390 --> 02:33:41,223
Wow.

5471
02:33:42,790 --> 02:33:44,260
So when the body died,

5472
02:33:44,950 --> 02:33:47,710
the parasite left it weaseled out.

5473
02:33:48,250 --> 02:33:48,851
Wow.

5474
02:33:48,851 --> 02:33:49,990
That is so fucked.

5475
02:33:49,991 --> 02:33:51,220
Look how big that thing is,

5476
02:33:51,221 --> 02:33:52,054
man.

5477
02:33:52,310 --> 02:33:52,521
It's like,

5478
02:33:52,521 --> 02:33:53,710
it just keeps going.

5479
02:33:53,930 --> 02:33:55,120
What doesn't know what to do either.

5480
02:33:55,121 --> 02:33:55,331
Yeah.

5481
02:33:55,331 --> 02:33:56,164
It's so big.

5482
02:33:56,980 --> 02:33:58,720
Oh my God.

5483
02:33:58,750 --> 02:34:00,280
It's the entire body of the thing.

5484
02:34:00,310 --> 02:34:01,420
That's incredible.

5485
02:34:01,450 --> 02:34:01,960
And it doesn't,

5486
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:04,750
the Mantis didn't look like
it was like fat or anything.

5487
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:06,250
And that spray that's on the ground,

5488
02:34:06,251 --> 02:34:06,911
that's the poison.

5489
02:34:06,911 --> 02:34:07,211
Right?

5490
02:34:07,211 --> 02:34:07,530
So it's,

5491
02:34:07,530 --> 02:34:09,100
it's a rolling around in the poison.

5492
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:10,300
It's still going.

5493
02:34:10,980 --> 02:34:12,850
That is so that parasite controlled the,

5494
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,270
the like,

5495
02:34:14,350 --> 02:34:15,071
like a Zombie.

5496
02:34:15,071 --> 02:34:16,050
He controlled the,

5497
02:34:16,051 --> 02:34:16,884
uh,

5498
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:17,823
the Mantas.

5499
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:18,581
Well,

5500
02:34:18,581 --> 02:34:20,170
there's an aquatic worm.

5501
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:25,500
I don't know if that's the same one
that it gets inside of a grasshopper and

5502
02:34:25,751 --> 02:34:27,310
when it's about to be born,

5503
02:34:27,490 --> 02:34:29,080
when it reaches the right size,

5504
02:34:29,110 --> 02:34:32,170
it actually takes over the mind to the
grasshopper and gets the grasshopper to

5505
02:34:32,171 --> 02:34:33,040
commit suicide.

5506
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:36,020
So it hot wires.

5507
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:37,571
Look at that thing,

5508
02:34:37,571 --> 02:34:38,110
man.

5509
02:34:38,110 --> 02:34:39,070
It looks like a snake.

5510
02:34:39,250 --> 02:34:40,540
Totally looks like a snake.

5511
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:43,353
I would

5512
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:44,253
not swallow that.

5513
02:34:44,370 --> 02:34:45,203
Yeah,

5514
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:46,870
you would for like a lot of money though,

5515
02:34:46,871 --> 02:34:47,140
right?

5516
02:34:47,140 --> 02:34:47,650
How much,

5517
02:34:47,650 --> 02:34:48,483
how much you do,

5518
02:34:48,620 --> 02:34:52,270
you have to get to how big
it would grow inside of you.

5519
02:34:52,280 --> 02:34:53,620
I look at human size of it.

5520
02:34:53,621 --> 02:34:55,180
When the guy grabbed it and touched it,

5521
02:34:55,870 --> 02:34:58,200
that is some alien invasion shin

5522
02:34:58,200 --> 02:34:59,120
type shit there.

5523
02:34:59,121 --> 02:34:59,990
That's what that is.

5524
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:02,700
And what if there's a
parasite living in that Paris?

5525
02:35:02,701 --> 02:35:05,150
That dude do

5526
02:35:06,670 --> 02:35:07,503
crazy.

5527
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:08,451
Right?

5528
02:35:08,451 --> 02:35:08,980
I'm wonder.

5529
02:35:08,980 --> 02:35:09,570
That's good.

5530
02:35:09,570 --> 02:35:10,540
Like there's parasites.

5531
02:35:10,541 --> 02:35:11,690
I did that live in humans.

5532
02:35:11,830 --> 02:35:12,320
Oh yeah.

5533
02:35:12,320 --> 02:35:13,850
It just grown your intestines.

5534
02:35:14,390 --> 02:35:15,223
Yeah.

5535
02:35:15,270 --> 02:35:16,103
That's bizarre.

5536
02:35:16,130 --> 02:35:16,963
From live Sushi.

5537
02:35:16,970 --> 02:35:17,241
Yeah.

5538
02:35:17,241 --> 02:35:19,370
People get it from fresh water Sushi.

5539
02:35:19,460 --> 02:35:23,120
They say that you shouldn't really
be chewing down too much salmon.

5540
02:35:23,210 --> 02:35:24,110
Salmon Sushi.

5541
02:35:24,111 --> 02:35:25,160
That's where you catch it.

5542
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:27,650
Like freshwater stuff
that lives in fresh water.

5543
02:35:28,370 --> 02:35:29,030
Yeah.

5544
02:35:29,030 --> 02:35:29,721
Fuck man.

5545
02:35:29,721 --> 02:35:30,560
Check this out.

5546
02:35:30,561 --> 02:35:31,394
This is creepy.

5547
02:35:31,770 --> 02:35:32,603
Uh,

5548
02:35:33,860 --> 02:35:34,693
what the fuck?

5549
02:35:35,810 --> 02:35:37,130
Look at their eyes.

5550
02:35:37,131 --> 02:35:38,960
It looks like like digital.

5551
02:35:39,020 --> 02:35:41,000
That's the last thing that mouse saw.

5552
02:35:41,870 --> 02:35:43,040
Jesus Christ.

5553
02:35:43,041 --> 02:35:44,030
What an evil bug.

5554
02:35:44,031 --> 02:35:45,280
A praying mantises.

5555
02:35:46,930 --> 02:35:47,671
Hi Guys.

5556
02:35:47,671 --> 02:35:50,210
It's kind of thing was
clamping down on your face.

5557
02:35:50,270 --> 02:35:51,590
The size of a giraffe.

5558
02:35:52,380 --> 02:35:53,150
This guys,

5559
02:35:53,150 --> 02:35:53,661
it's funny.

5560
02:35:53,661 --> 02:35:55,430
It looks like a lot of models.

5561
02:35:56,030 --> 02:35:56,780
How dare you,

5562
02:35:56,780 --> 02:36:00,290
like when it was Molly really does
a lot of models look like aliens?

5563
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:02,930
Is that an eyeball third eye?

5564
02:36:02,980 --> 02:36:03,440
Yeah.

5565
02:36:03,440 --> 02:36:05,470
Is that what it is or
is it just like a good,

5566
02:36:05,540 --> 02:36:06,890
it's even spiritual.

5567
02:36:07,230 --> 02:36:08,130
It's totally spiritual.

5568
02:36:08,131 --> 02:36:11,180
I'm 40 to 10 it's like
gold plated in tennis.

5569
02:36:11,210 --> 02:36:12,050
They're dope as fuck.

5570
02:36:12,051 --> 02:36:12,884
Yo look at that.

5571
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:13,940
That is pretty cool.

5572
02:36:13,941 --> 02:36:14,510
It's like,

5573
02:36:14,510 --> 02:36:15,370
it's like braided.

5574
02:36:15,380 --> 02:36:16,213
It's Persian.

5575
02:36:20,210 --> 02:36:21,860
Don't tell Mazda body that joke

5576
02:36:24,290 --> 02:36:24,531
bro.

5577
02:36:24,531 --> 02:36:25,460
That's so racist.

5578
02:36:25,580 --> 02:36:26,140
Yeah.

5579
02:36:26,140 --> 02:36:27,310
What does it have to be Persian?

5580
02:36:27,500 --> 02:36:29,960
Going to be Mexican
because go to studio city.

5581
02:36:30,140 --> 02:36:32,300
That's why I go walk around there.

5582
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:34,780
They didn't even look real.

5583
02:36:35,540 --> 02:36:36,330
Yeah.

5584
02:36:36,330 --> 02:36:38,150
When you see them on a large scale,

5585
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:40,190
you get a sense of what it really is.

5586
02:36:40,550 --> 02:36:41,570
When you see those fuckers.

5587
02:36:41,660 --> 02:36:43,110
It's not trying to kill a frog.

5588
02:36:43,130 --> 02:36:43,220
No,

5589
02:36:43,220 --> 02:36:44,780
it's just hanging out
on top of it for hog.

5590
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:45,710
Wow.

5591
02:36:45,710 --> 02:36:46,340
They're like buddies.

5592
02:36:46,340 --> 02:36:47,540
It's like I need a ride.

5593
02:36:48,470 --> 02:36:49,303
Wow.

5594
02:36:50,060 --> 02:36:51,200
Those things are amazing.

5595
02:36:51,201 --> 02:36:53,930
A lot of pictures of frogs
and them being friends.

5596
02:36:54,350 --> 02:36:58,580
That is a gangster bug but I kind of
liked it to translate jacked it cause that

5597
02:36:58,581 --> 02:37:03,581
was a battle to the death and torrential
one tranche will reverse position and

5598
02:37:04,581 --> 02:37:05,970
sunk those teeth in it.

5599
02:37:07,310 --> 02:37:11,540
I wonder if in nature though who
would have won cause it's camouflaged.

5600
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:12,140
Hmm.

5601
02:37:12,140 --> 02:37:12,680
You know what I mean?

5602
02:37:12,680 --> 02:37:13,910
Cause that was in the kitchen.

5603
02:37:13,970 --> 02:37:14,250
Yeah.

5604
02:37:14,250 --> 02:37:18,080
Looks like they said that fight up
right before they turn on the camera.

5605
02:37:18,090 --> 02:37:19,820
They broke one of the man as his legs.

5606
02:37:19,821 --> 02:37:20,031
I'm like,

5607
02:37:20,031 --> 02:37:20,211
all right,

5608
02:37:20,211 --> 02:37:20,780
go.

5609
02:37:20,780 --> 02:37:20,991
Yeah.

5610
02:37:20,991 --> 02:37:25,090
I wonder if the praying mantis would go
after something as big as a trench a lot

5611
02:37:25,100 --> 02:37:25,880
in the wild.

5612
02:37:25,880 --> 02:37:26,690
Yeah.

5613
02:37:26,690 --> 02:37:29,510
It seems like they're just so evil to go
after anything that's in front of them.

5614
02:37:29,900 --> 02:37:31,520
The fucking things are attacking birds.

5615
02:37:31,730 --> 02:37:35,330
I know in mice and mice and
they win and a fucking cat.

5616
02:37:35,610 --> 02:37:36,680
That's just crazy.

5617
02:37:36,980 --> 02:37:37,191
Yeah.

5618
02:37:37,191 --> 02:37:38,090
They don't give a fuck.

5619
02:37:38,150 --> 02:37:42,770
They go off to cats like every animal
has an another animal they run from.

5620
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:43,400
Would they go,

5621
02:37:43,400 --> 02:37:44,031
oh shit.

5622
02:37:44,031 --> 02:37:44,361
All right,

5623
02:37:44,361 --> 02:37:45,194
I'm out of here.

5624
02:37:45,320 --> 02:37:45,620
Yeah.

5625
02:37:45,620 --> 02:37:46,610
We own this area,

5626
02:37:46,790 --> 02:37:47,211
that praying,

5627
02:37:47,211 --> 02:37:47,431
man,

5628
02:37:47,431 --> 02:37:48,530
his didn't even try to fly away.

5629
02:37:48,531 --> 02:37:49,310
It has wings,

5630
02:37:49,310 --> 02:37:49,610
right?

5631
02:37:49,610 --> 02:37:51,440
They have wings and he's like,

5632
02:37:51,470 --> 02:37:52,180
Nah,

5633
02:37:52,180 --> 02:37:53,880
I'll just fucking take my chance.

5634
02:37:53,940 --> 02:37:54,920
He took it out.

5635
02:37:56,640 --> 02:37:57,473
Can

5636
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:00,080
get some

5637
02:38:02,870 --> 02:38:04,500
fucking stupid nose

5638
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:09,500
praying mantises sidewalk.

5639
02:38:10,730 --> 02:38:11,563
It's like,

5640
02:38:11,720 --> 02:38:12,381
seriously.

5641
02:38:12,381 --> 02:38:14,060
That's like you finding a house.

5642
02:38:14,670 --> 02:38:17,690
It's like you fighting
like a giant elephant,

5643
02:38:18,430 --> 02:38:20,120
like a semi truck.

5644
02:38:21,260 --> 02:38:23,550
You're smaller than you,

5645
02:38:23,551 --> 02:38:23,881
you.

5646
02:38:23,881 --> 02:38:26,540
You're bigger in comparison.

5647
02:38:26,930 --> 02:38:28,010
Then you would be,

5648
02:38:28,290 --> 02:38:29,360
if you were fighting an elephant,

5649
02:38:29,361 --> 02:38:30,770
then that thing is to that cat.

5650
02:38:31,140 --> 02:38:34,040
What does this wait till
you see you in the Mantas?

5651
02:38:34,970 --> 02:38:35,661
Oh yeah.

5652
02:38:35,661 --> 02:38:39,140
He's like tucked away
in there like a flower.

5653
02:38:39,980 --> 02:38:40,813
What an evil.

5654
02:38:41,660 --> 02:38:43,880
He's pretending to be a flower.

5655
02:38:43,940 --> 02:38:44,810
Close quarters.

5656
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:46,633
Some of the safe.

5657
02:38:46,700 --> 02:38:51,700
What a creepy ass fucking bug he looks
exactly like the color of the flower.

5658
02:38:53,181 --> 02:38:58,070
Totally blended in and to hide is
something beautiful to look at that that's

5659
02:38:58,071 --> 02:39:02,930
what they say about the dads and
credible and look at this fly like,

5660
02:39:02,931 --> 02:39:03,261
oh,

5661
02:39:03,261 --> 02:39:03,651
you know,

5662
02:39:03,651 --> 02:39:04,440
just hanging out.

5663
02:39:04,440 --> 02:39:04,940
Nothing.

5664
02:39:04,940 --> 02:39:05,773
Bitch.

5665
02:39:06,620 --> 02:39:07,670
Look how quick it did that.

5666
02:39:07,671 --> 02:39:08,570
You can't even see it.

5667
02:39:10,700 --> 02:39:10,941
Oh,

5668
02:39:10,941 --> 02:39:12,230
and just eat your face.

5669
02:39:12,410 --> 02:39:13,243
Eat Him alive.

5670
02:39:14,090 --> 02:39:15,230
Wow,

5671
02:39:15,710 --> 02:39:15,981
dude.

5672
02:39:15,981 --> 02:39:18,140
Back that shit up so we could
wash that one more time.

5673
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:21,060
What a bizarre animal.

5674
02:39:21,080 --> 02:39:23,930
Let's say for sure where
the plant ends and begins.

5675
02:39:23,931 --> 02:39:24,764
Second starts.

5676
02:39:25,730 --> 02:39:28,370
You really can't tell this elaborate,

5677
02:39:28,490 --> 02:39:29,000
brilliant.

5678
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:32,260
The menace to hunt at its leisure account.

5679
02:39:32,360 --> 02:39:32,901
Brilliant.

5680
02:39:32,901 --> 02:39:33,141
It is.

5681
02:39:33,141 --> 02:39:33,950
It looks so much,

5682
02:39:33,950 --> 02:39:34,191
I mean,

5683
02:39:34,191 --> 02:39:35,150
even the highlights,

5684
02:39:35,420 --> 02:39:37,190
the pink highlights like a flower.

5685
02:39:39,650 --> 02:39:40,483
Oh,

5686
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:42,320
fast.

5687
02:39:42,330 --> 02:39:42,830
Fast.

5688
02:39:42,830 --> 02:39:44,450
You can't see shit.

5689
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:46,580
Oh my God.

5690
02:39:46,660 --> 02:39:47,493
Pretty.

5691
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:48,560
It's beautiful.

5692
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:51,560
That's like the most beautiful image.

5693
02:39:51,660 --> 02:39:52,220
Yeah.

5694
02:39:52,220 --> 02:39:54,020
The most beautiful video of something.

5695
02:39:54,021 --> 02:39:55,280
Killing something ever.

5696
02:39:55,640 --> 02:39:57,890
I know the colors,

5697
02:39:57,891 --> 02:39:59,300
like the white with the blue.

5698
02:39:59,360 --> 02:40:00,171
Oh my God.

5699
02:40:00,171 --> 02:40:01,100
Look at that one.

5700
02:40:01,790 --> 02:40:03,200
That's incredible.

5701
02:40:03,560 --> 02:40:04,970
That is incredible.

5702
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:06,193
Wow.

5703
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:09,830
It's like we're looking at
this image from the and board.

5704
02:40:10,760 --> 02:40:11,061
Yeah,

5705
02:40:11,061 --> 02:40:11,651
it's gorgeous.

5706
02:40:11,651 --> 02:40:14,820
It takes shape as like one
of the most beautiful images.

5707
02:40:14,850 --> 02:40:15,450
Yeah.

5708
02:40:15,450 --> 02:40:17,040
Like who doesn't like a flower?

5709
02:40:17,340 --> 02:40:18,810
And they did it perfect.

5710
02:40:19,290 --> 02:40:19,690
Like with,

5711
02:40:19,690 --> 02:40:21,360
with perfect highlights.

5712
02:40:21,570 --> 02:40:26,070
Like I would have never thought about you
if you showed me a photo of that and I

5713
02:40:26,071 --> 02:40:28,620
didn't watch the video of never thought
there's a praying mantis in there.

5714
02:40:28,621 --> 02:40:29,880
I would've bet you a lot of money.

5715
02:40:30,260 --> 02:40:31,093
Oh yeah.

5716
02:40:31,210 --> 02:40:32,030
This is it.

5717
02:40:32,030 --> 02:40:32,461
Pray Man.

5718
02:40:32,461 --> 02:40:33,540
Minutes in that none.

5719
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:34,321
Zero.

5720
02:40:34,321 --> 02:40:35,010
That's a flower.

5721
02:40:35,010 --> 02:40:36,150
You fucking idiot.

5722
02:40:36,151 --> 02:40:37,590
You need to know what a mess looks like.

5723
02:40:37,591 --> 02:40:38,424
Come on on a bet.

5724
02:40:38,720 --> 02:40:40,170
Where would it fit in that flower?

5725
02:40:41,310 --> 02:40:42,210
Don't be retarded.

5726
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:43,290
You really think you can look that?

5727
02:40:43,320 --> 02:40:43,560
No,

5728
02:40:43,560 --> 02:40:44,820
it looked exactly like it.

5729
02:40:44,910 --> 02:40:45,541
You know what that means?

5730
02:40:45,541 --> 02:40:46,830
If they were the size of humans,

5731
02:40:46,831 --> 02:40:50,790
they'd be like taking like the shape of
like cheeseburgers and like all kinds of

5732
02:40:50,791 --> 02:40:51,151
stuff.

5733
02:40:51,151 --> 02:40:53,160
Or would it look like the
guys from Duck Dynasty?

5734
02:40:53,220 --> 02:40:54,360
They'd be wearing Camo.

5735
02:40:54,460 --> 02:40:55,293
Right?

5736
02:40:55,730 --> 02:40:56,850
Look at that rock in here.

5737
02:40:57,650 --> 02:40:59,320
That love that.

5738
02:40:59,340 --> 02:41:00,720
It's so weird.

5739
02:41:01,350 --> 02:41:03,720
That's so weird that that's a real thing.

5740
02:41:03,780 --> 02:41:04,231
I can't,

5741
02:41:04,231 --> 02:41:05,310
people do that.

5742
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:07,140
We were lucky people can't do that.

5743
02:41:07,141 --> 02:41:08,310
They would be eating people.

5744
02:41:08,311 --> 02:41:10,380
The way they manage is eating flies,

5745
02:41:10,710 --> 02:41:10,990
you know,

5746
02:41:10,990 --> 02:41:12,900
just can't camouflage.

5747
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:13,141
Yeah.

5748
02:41:13,141 --> 02:41:14,070
And that would not be good.

5749
02:41:14,071 --> 02:41:14,910
People would be hiding.

5750
02:41:15,290 --> 02:41:16,350
That's true in your bushes.

5751
02:41:16,540 --> 02:41:18,710
This like six people
in here that were like,

5752
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:22,260
people will be blown over
like the character on x.

5753
02:41:22,270 --> 02:41:23,510
Men w mystique.

5754
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:23,830
Yeah.

5755
02:41:23,830 --> 02:41:24,480
Mystique.

5756
02:41:24,480 --> 02:41:25,540
How come they have a new mistake?

5757
02:41:25,541 --> 02:41:27,600
And they didn't even bring
that up by the way they,

5758
02:41:27,660 --> 02:41:28,630
how'd they go from her bra?

5759
02:41:28,740 --> 02:41:31,530
Rebecca Romaine Stamos age.

5760
02:41:31,560 --> 02:41:32,393
She got too old.

5761
02:41:32,430 --> 02:41:32,551
Oh,

5762
02:41:32,551 --> 02:41:33,384
cause it's like,

5763
02:41:33,930 --> 02:41:34,470
yeah.

5764
02:41:34,470 --> 02:41:34,910
Yeah.

5765
02:41:34,910 --> 02:41:35,491
It doesn't matter.

5766
02:41:35,491 --> 02:41:36,330
It's a different person.

5767
02:41:36,540 --> 02:41:37,740
Don't they have CGI?

5768
02:41:37,860 --> 02:41:39,390
They can turn one guy.

5769
02:41:39,420 --> 02:41:39,900
You know,

5770
02:41:39,900 --> 02:41:43,470
they could turn people into the Hawk and
you tell me you can't CGI that check to

5771
02:41:43,471 --> 02:41:44,970
look exactly like Rebecca Romaine.

5772
02:41:44,970 --> 02:41:45,870
Stamos right.

5773
02:41:46,020 --> 02:41:46,853
Come on in son.

5774
02:41:46,890 --> 02:41:48,270
That evil fucking thing.

5775
02:41:48,570 --> 02:41:49,830
What's it eating their ice cream.

5776
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:51,611
I want work.

5777
02:41:51,611 --> 02:41:52,280
That is,

5778
02:41:52,280 --> 02:41:54,750
it looks like some sort of
a bowling pin off a grenade.

5779
02:41:55,700 --> 02:41:56,610
Seen a Turkey leg.

5780
02:41:58,220 --> 02:41:59,053
He's got the rent a farm.

5781
02:41:59,900 --> 02:42:00,733
That's fair.

5782
02:42:01,130 --> 02:42:01,963
That's fair.

5783
02:42:02,820 --> 02:42:05,940
I think the bug world is the
creepiest world and all of nature.

5784
02:42:06,010 --> 02:42:06,450
Yeah.

5785
02:42:06,450 --> 02:42:07,920
Second only to the fish world.

5786
02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:09,350
Right.

5787
02:42:09,350 --> 02:42:09,990
But visual,

5788
02:42:09,990 --> 02:42:10,823
it's pretty creepy.

5789
02:42:10,830 --> 02:42:13,800
Bugs will look so creepy
and they're able to like,

5790
02:42:13,830 --> 02:42:15,740
they have multiple hands tentacles,

5791
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:16,500
all these things.

5792
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:17,333
Yeah.

5793
02:42:17,670 --> 02:42:18,510
And fish cause you know,

5794
02:42:18,511 --> 02:42:18,781
you're like,

5795
02:42:18,781 --> 02:42:19,210
well it's out.

5796
02:42:19,210 --> 02:42:20,041
If it's out of the water,

5797
02:42:20,041 --> 02:42:20,551
it's over.

5798
02:42:20,551 --> 02:42:22,380
Put a bug can just get in your bed,

5799
02:42:22,550 --> 02:42:23,580
sneaking in your house.

5800
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:25,110
What's the world's largest bug?

5801
02:42:25,800 --> 02:42:26,640
Here's a good question.

5802
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:28,200
What would you have if you had to guess,

5803
02:42:28,500 --> 02:42:30,390
would you say the world's
largest bug is the iPhone.

5804
02:42:30,460 --> 02:42:31,050
Okay.

5805
02:42:31,050 --> 02:42:35,350
Why are you fucking baby
world's largest bug?

5806
02:42:38,130 --> 02:42:38,250
Well,

5807
02:42:38,250 --> 02:42:42,130
probably like some kind of cockroaches
beetle beetle or some kind of something.

5808
02:42:42,140 --> 02:42:43,130
That half life thing.

5809
02:42:43,190 --> 02:42:43,981
Oh my God.

5810
02:42:43,981 --> 02:42:45,290
It's a hit or miss.

5811
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:45,760
It's,

5812
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:46,490
it's this.

5813
02:42:46,490 --> 02:42:47,750
Oh my God.

5814
02:42:47,800 --> 02:42:48,650
You look like a pill bug.

5815
02:42:49,430 --> 02:42:50,780
It's so big.

5816
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:51,201
It's,

5817
02:42:51,201 --> 02:42:53,180
this is a gross animal.

5818
02:42:53,300 --> 02:42:53,961
Woke up.

5819
02:42:53,961 --> 02:42:57,680
The world's biggest insect
is so huge and eats carrots.

5820
02:42:58,220 --> 02:42:59,053
What?

5821
02:42:59,060 --> 02:42:59,811
It's so huge.

5822
02:42:59,811 --> 02:43:00,501
It eats carrots.

5823
02:43:00,501 --> 02:43:01,334
Look at this thing.

5824
02:43:02,730 --> 02:43:03,563
Whoa.

5825
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:06,593
That's like,

5826
02:43:06,690 --> 02:43:07,411
exactly.

5827
02:43:07,411 --> 02:43:08,220
That's a great,

5828
02:43:08,220 --> 02:43:09,300
great sound.

5829
02:43:10,020 --> 02:43:10,720
That's real.

5830
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:11,553
Wow.

5831
02:43:11,590 --> 02:43:12,580
It's a giant

5832
02:43:12,850 --> 02:43:13,261
wait.

5833
02:43:13,261 --> 02:43:13,811
A w.

5834
02:43:13,811 --> 02:43:16,590
E.

5835
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:16,590
T.

5836
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:16,590
A.

5837
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:18,640
M m came across the cricket like creature,

5838
02:43:18,641 --> 02:43:20,800
which has a wingspan of seven inches.

5839
02:43:21,130 --> 02:43:26,130
After two days of searching on a tiny
island lake barrier island in New Zealand,

5840
02:43:26,710 --> 02:43:28,180
it only lives there.

5841
02:43:28,930 --> 02:43:33,930
It was a wiped off the mainland by rats
accidentally introduced by Europeans.

5842
02:43:34,570 --> 02:43:35,560
Pull that picture up again,

5843
02:43:35,561 --> 02:43:36,394
man.

5844
02:43:36,580 --> 02:43:37,413
Here's another one.

5845
02:43:37,570 --> 02:43:41,530
Is that a big grasshopper
rice that things gross grass.

5846
02:43:42,010 --> 02:43:46,320
It's like a crab or lobster or
something which are related by the way.

5847
02:43:46,350 --> 02:43:46,480
Yeah.

5848
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:48,460
I was thinking it was going
to be something like this,

5849
02:43:49,060 --> 02:43:50,620
which was like a pill bug.

5850
02:43:50,650 --> 02:43:52,570
I thought that's pretty big too.

5851
02:43:52,820 --> 02:43:53,410
Yeah.

5852
02:43:53,410 --> 02:43:55,390
That's a Madagascar hissing cockroaches,

5853
02:43:55,391 --> 02:43:56,224
isn't it?

5854
02:43:56,520 --> 02:43:57,280
Um,

5855
02:43:57,280 --> 02:43:58,330
I think that's what that is.

5856
02:43:58,331 --> 02:43:59,200
They get pretty big.

5857
02:43:59,620 --> 02:44:00,460
Didn't meet one of them.

5858
02:44:01,990 --> 02:44:02,980
I ate one of those.

5859
02:44:04,420 --> 02:44:05,140
Hold up bad.

5860
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:05,231
Hey,

5861
02:44:05,231 --> 02:44:06,810
this is what I thought
it was like one of these,

5862
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:07,330
Oh yeah,

5863
02:44:07,330 --> 02:44:10,660
those creepy things like
cephalopods or something like that.

5864
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:13,030
Those are called like land otters.

5865
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:13,780
Yeah.

5866
02:44:13,780 --> 02:44:15,310
Those things have been around for a long

5867
02:44:17,300 --> 02:44:18,133
arenas.

5868
02:44:19,130 --> 02:44:19,710
They hate,

5869
02:44:19,710 --> 02:44:21,460
it's stoner varieties.

5870
02:44:21,461 --> 02:44:23,820
The technical name for
those things and say,

5871
02:44:24,020 --> 02:44:24,853
and that image

5872
02:44:26,770 --> 02:44:28,510
I lost of Pod,

5873
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:29,680
loss of Pod,

5874
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:30,753
lots of pod.

5875
02:44:30,900 --> 02:44:33,490
I remember that I pod pod I suppose.

5876
02:44:33,540 --> 02:44:33,731
Yeah,

5877
02:44:33,731 --> 02:44:34,564
that's it.

5878
02:44:34,780 --> 02:44:35,740
Jesus Christ.

5879
02:44:36,700 --> 02:44:37,391
It's a lobster.

5880
02:44:37,391 --> 02:44:41,740
It's like a land lobster
that's bigger obviously.

5881
02:44:41,790 --> 02:44:42,160
Yeah.

5882
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:43,330
So that's must be the biggest,

5883
02:44:43,470 --> 02:44:46,860
but that that has like more than isn't
eight legs are more considered like an

5884
02:44:48,510 --> 02:44:49,800
insect is six.

5885
02:44:50,210 --> 02:44:50,601
Yeah.

5886
02:44:50,601 --> 02:44:51,230
I Dunno.

5887
02:44:51,230 --> 02:44:52,460
Is that how it works in sac?

5888
02:44:52,461 --> 02:44:53,390
Sac being six.

5889
02:44:53,391 --> 02:44:53,990
Yeah,

5890
02:44:53,990 --> 02:44:54,823
that makes sense.

5891
02:44:55,100 --> 02:44:55,490
Right?

5892
02:44:55,490 --> 02:44:57,140
Like Arachnid is spider

5893
02:44:59,590 --> 02:45:00,260
right away?

5894
02:45:00,260 --> 02:45:01,610
This is Nikki stuff's new CD.

5895
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:02,300
Oh,

5896
02:45:02,300 --> 02:45:02,760
what is it?

5897
02:45:02,760 --> 02:45:03,061
Oh yeah.

5898
02:45:03,061 --> 02:45:04,440
I forgot about my own album.

5899
02:45:04,441 --> 02:45:06,270
It's got a little dot stop.

5900
02:45:06,280 --> 02:45:07,830
Dot Downing this oh

5901
02:45:09,550 --> 02:45:09,940
Morgan.

5902
02:45:09,940 --> 02:45:11,460
It really stopped.

5903
02:45:11,461 --> 02:45:12,570
Not only at ladies and gentlemen,

5904
02:45:12,571 --> 02:45:13,680
I tunes and all things,

5905
02:45:13,681 --> 02:45:15,690
comedy.com please purchase it.

5906
02:45:15,691 --> 02:45:17,460
It's my first album and
I'm very proud of it.

5907
02:45:17,630 --> 02:45:20,320
[inaudible] old school
comedy store veteran.

5908
02:45:21,240 --> 02:45:21,550
Dude,

5909
02:45:21,550 --> 02:45:22,330
you go back.

5910
02:45:22,330 --> 02:45:23,290
I know you from,

5911
02:45:23,700 --> 02:45:24,191
when did I meet?

5912
02:45:24,191 --> 02:45:25,410
You probably met you in

5913
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:30,050
parking lot of the comedy store in 2002,

5914
02:45:30,050 --> 02:45:30,960
three and you were a,

5915
02:45:30,961 --> 02:45:31,910
you wish to work there.

5916
02:45:31,940 --> 02:45:32,360
Oh yeah.

5917
02:45:32,360 --> 02:45:34,040
He did the whole stint like Ari,

5918
02:45:34,041 --> 02:45:34,780
like a lot of guys.

5919
02:45:34,780 --> 02:45:35,210
So yeah,

5920
02:45:35,210 --> 02:45:37,070
that's how I met Ari Dunkin.

5921
02:45:37,190 --> 02:45:38,001
I worked the phones.

5922
02:45:38,001 --> 02:45:38,990
He was the talent coordinator.

5923
02:45:40,100 --> 02:45:41,360
Dunkin did the full stint.

5924
02:45:41,450 --> 02:45:43,700
I know that's a good stint for comics.

5925
02:45:43,850 --> 02:45:46,250
That's the one place
where comic can get a job.

5926
02:45:46,430 --> 02:45:47,270
Like doing comedy,

5927
02:45:47,271 --> 02:45:50,510
being surrounded by degenerates on a
constant basis and eventually become a

5928
02:45:50,511 --> 02:45:53,240
professional comedian to
have his own comedy CD.

5929
02:45:53,270 --> 02:45:53,961
Exactly.

5930
02:45:53,961 --> 02:45:54,470
Yeah.

5931
02:45:54,470 --> 02:45:55,580
I love those stories,

5932
02:45:55,581 --> 02:45:56,030
man.

5933
02:45:56,030 --> 02:45:58,300
I love watching guys come up in,

5934
02:45:58,310 --> 02:45:59,180
in La.

5935
02:45:59,230 --> 02:45:59,750
Um,

5936
02:45:59,750 --> 02:46:02,270
that was one of the few places
where you'd see guys come up.

5937
02:46:02,600 --> 02:46:04,490
Joey Diaz is starting to
do the comedy store again.

5938
02:46:04,550 --> 02:46:05,383
I love that.

5939
02:46:06,020 --> 02:46:08,020
That's strange dilemma that,

5940
02:46:08,030 --> 02:46:08,660
uh,

5941
02:46:08,660 --> 02:46:10,130
since Tommy has

5942
02:46:10,130 --> 02:46:15,130
decided to part ways with the comedy
serve on to the next stage of a existence.

5943
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:19,430
Suicide did a great ice
house chronicles Friday,

5944
02:46:19,431 --> 02:46:20,264
by word,

5945
02:46:20,540 --> 02:46:21,760
I mean Tammy [inaudible],

5946
02:46:21,980 --> 02:46:22,850
Hannibal Buress.

5947
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:25,760
I mean everybody came in because
everyone wanted to talk about it.

5948
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:26,653
Yeah.

5949
02:46:26,870 --> 02:46:28,850
Everybody wanted to talk about
how ridiculous Tommy was.

5950
02:46:30,650 --> 02:46:31,060
Yeah,

5951
02:46:31,060 --> 02:46:32,710
it's great episode.

5952
02:46:33,010 --> 02:46:33,720
Hey man,

5953
02:46:33,720 --> 02:46:34,600
he defend them.

5954
02:46:35,290 --> 02:46:35,591
You know,

5955
02:46:35,591 --> 02:46:40,090
everyone kind of had somewhat
defended him as being,

5956
02:46:40,091 --> 02:46:40,391
you know,

5957
02:46:40,391 --> 02:46:43,930
like this mysterious person and it's
probably going to be the end of that part

5958
02:46:43,931 --> 02:46:45,340
of the grocery store where it's like,

5959
02:46:45,580 --> 02:46:45,911
Ooh,

5960
02:46:45,911 --> 02:46:47,140
it's haunted and Oh,

5961
02:46:47,141 --> 02:46:47,974
Mitzi.

5962
02:46:48,100 --> 02:46:48,371
But,

5963
02:46:48,371 --> 02:46:48,700
uh,

5964
02:46:48,700 --> 02:46:49,390
uh,

5965
02:46:49,390 --> 02:46:50,223
I think,

5966
02:46:50,250 --> 02:46:50,621
you know,

5967
02:46:50,621 --> 02:46:50,770
I,

5968
02:46:50,770 --> 02:46:55,540
I showed a couple of the videos that I've
made and I think that kind of silence

5969
02:46:55,541 --> 02:46:55,841
everyone,

5970
02:46:55,841 --> 02:46:55,991
like,

5971
02:46:55,991 --> 02:46:56,201
yeah,

5972
02:46:56,201 --> 02:46:57,034
he was crazy.

5973
02:46:58,330 --> 02:46:58,720
Well,

5974
02:46:58,720 --> 02:46:59,553
don't you

5975
02:46:59,890 --> 02:47:04,890
deal though to take that job and to
try to keep up the legacy of that famed

5976
02:47:06,221 --> 02:47:07,900
institution of insanity.

5977
02:47:08,110 --> 02:47:09,310
You gotta be a little crazy.

5978
02:47:09,460 --> 02:47:10,900
Nobody else wants that job.

5979
02:47:10,930 --> 02:47:12,460
Nobody else would have done that job.

5980
02:47:12,610 --> 02:47:16,000
They would have turned it into
some sort of a corporate whatever,

5981
02:47:16,001 --> 02:47:16,241
you know,

5982
02:47:16,241 --> 02:47:17,051
fill in the blank.

5983
02:47:17,051 --> 02:47:17,920
Sugar Shack.

5984
02:47:18,070 --> 02:47:18,730
Chuckle hut.

5985
02:47:18,730 --> 02:47:19,121
Yeah,

5986
02:47:19,121 --> 02:47:19,900
exactly.

5987
02:47:19,900 --> 02:47:20,401
I mean it,

5988
02:47:20,401 --> 02:47:24,160
it could have easily been something
that it isn't what it is is a very,

5989
02:47:24,161 --> 02:47:27,340
very bizarre place as
far as comedy clubs go.

5990
02:47:27,550 --> 02:47:31,840
One of the most bizarre places of all
time and one of the most historical comedy

5991
02:47:31,841 --> 02:47:33,700
clubs ever in the world.

5992
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:34,360
Oh yeah,

5993
02:47:34,360 --> 02:47:34,651
that's fine.

5994
02:47:34,651 --> 02:47:35,950
The Art of standup comedy,

5995
02:47:36,580 --> 02:47:39,730
how many historical comedy
clubs rival the comedy store?

5996
02:47:40,120 --> 02:47:42,490
Very few because it's
in the same location.

5997
02:47:42,790 --> 02:47:42,971
You know,

5998
02:47:42,971 --> 02:47:44,590
you have like a few other ones.

5999
02:47:44,591 --> 02:47:45,401
Like the Ice House,

6000
02:47:45,401 --> 02:47:46,234
it's older,

6001
02:47:46,390 --> 02:47:47,380
you have um,

6002
02:47:47,620 --> 02:47:48,670
comedy magic club,

6003
02:47:48,671 --> 02:47:49,241
which is older,

6004
02:47:49,241 --> 02:47:50,080
the laugh factory,

6005
02:47:50,081 --> 02:47:51,670
which has a lot of
historical significance.

6006
02:47:51,670 --> 02:47:53,950
But laugh factory is not the same.

6007
02:47:54,250 --> 02:47:55,990
The laugh factory is not just,

6008
02:47:56,050 --> 02:47:56,890
it's a good club.

6009
02:47:56,891 --> 02:47:57,880
It's a great club to work at.

6010
02:47:57,881 --> 02:47:58,870
But as far as like,

6011
02:47:59,440 --> 02:48:01,660
like a place where when
you're there you're like,

6012
02:48:01,661 --> 02:48:02,530
Holy Shit,

6013
02:48:02,531 --> 02:48:04,060
I'm not that goddamn comedy show.

6014
02:48:04,180 --> 02:48:04,630
You know,

6015
02:48:04,630 --> 02:48:09,630
that was the Mecca because the store like
pre produced comics with the ice house

6016
02:48:09,971 --> 02:48:11,980
and the other ones just
have had them come through.

6017
02:48:12,080 --> 02:48:12,591
Exactly.

6018
02:48:12,591 --> 02:48:13,180
Yeah.

6019
02:48:13,180 --> 02:48:13,361
Yeah.

6020
02:48:13,361 --> 02:48:13,840
The stores,

6021
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:16,930
the one of the only places that
produced comics all because of Mitzi.

6022
02:48:17,260 --> 02:48:17,770
Yeah.

6023
02:48:17,770 --> 02:48:18,830
You know that lady,

6024
02:48:19,390 --> 02:48:20,860
she helped a lot of Comedians,

6025
02:48:20,861 --> 02:48:21,694
me included.

6026
02:48:22,300 --> 02:48:22,600
Yeah.

6027
02:48:22,600 --> 02:48:24,220
She helped a lot of comedians.

6028
02:48:24,350 --> 02:48:28,220
I think if they just keep the open
mics as strong as it is there.

6029
02:48:28,221 --> 02:48:30,590
I mean like Sundays and Mondays there,

6030
02:48:30,640 --> 02:48:31,010
uh,

6031
02:48:31,010 --> 02:48:31,410
you know,

6032
02:48:31,410 --> 02:48:33,800
they have a really good open
Mike Program Killed Tony.

6033
02:48:33,801 --> 02:48:34,880
On top of that is,

6034
02:48:34,881 --> 02:48:35,210
you know,

6035
02:48:35,210 --> 02:48:36,043
really good for them.

6036
02:48:36,320 --> 02:48:40,400
I think that you'll still be able to make
new comics there and it was still be a

6037
02:48:40,401 --> 02:48:42,950
good place for hiring Starbucks employees,

6038
02:48:42,980 --> 02:48:45,410
letting them kind of
graduate through the system.

6039
02:48:45,590 --> 02:48:46,010
Yeah.

6040
02:48:46,010 --> 02:48:46,670
And now that,

6041
02:48:46,670 --> 02:48:47,031
you know,

6042
02:48:47,031 --> 02:48:50,810
you remove some of the crazy aspect as
far as like the real negative crazy.

6043
02:48:51,250 --> 02:48:56,250
There was just too much ego and madness
and just too much intolerable madness is

6044
02:48:57,010 --> 02:48:57,210
here.

6045
02:48:57,210 --> 02:48:58,370
The best way to describe it.

6046
02:48:58,371 --> 02:49:00,560
Like you're not dealing
with rational people.

6047
02:49:00,561 --> 02:49:03,860
You're dealing with someone
who's intolerably crazy
and it's not that the whole

6048
02:49:03,861 --> 02:49:06,380
intolerable crew is removed.

6049
02:49:06,680 --> 02:49:09,270
There's still some in co
intolerable behind the scenes folks,

6050
02:49:10,050 --> 02:49:11,010
but it's way better now.

6051
02:49:11,070 --> 02:49:12,330
It's at least gotten 50% better.

6052
02:49:12,450 --> 02:49:15,780
And that other group you never see ever,

6053
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:16,740
ever,

6054
02:49:16,740 --> 02:49:17,610
ever there.

6055
02:49:17,670 --> 02:49:18,300
So it's,

6056
02:49:18,300 --> 02:49:19,050
it doesn't matter.

6057
02:49:19,050 --> 02:49:19,650
Yeah.

6058
02:49:19,650 --> 02:49:22,670
And you could also go on line to see what
we're in when they're out of town and

6059
02:49:22,671 --> 02:49:26,280
it's got to that stage that's
makes you seem like a stalker.

6060
02:49:26,710 --> 02:49:27,071
You know,

6061
02:49:27,071 --> 02:49:28,240
I love the Improv man.

6062
02:49:28,500 --> 02:49:33,250
I did one thing to change my act quite
a bit is when I left the store and I

6063
02:49:33,251 --> 02:49:34,240
started doing the Improv,

6064
02:49:34,870 --> 02:49:37,480
I found audiences that aren't heckling,

6065
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:39,310
they're not like constantly heckling.

6066
02:49:39,340 --> 02:49:40,780
They have actually have crowd control.

6067
02:49:41,500 --> 02:49:41,921
And then I,

6068
02:49:41,921 --> 02:49:43,990
and then I also noticed that
they have two shows a night.

6069
02:49:43,991 --> 02:49:45,490
They'll do an eight o'clock
show on 10 o'clock show,

6070
02:49:45,491 --> 02:49:48,400
which is way better for like
the audience's attention span.

6071
02:49:48,820 --> 02:49:50,580
And it made me realize like the con,

6072
02:49:50,630 --> 02:49:54,100
the comedy store's like lifting
weights with like a weight vest on,

6073
02:49:54,101 --> 02:49:54,940
running up a hill.

6074
02:49:55,210 --> 02:49:57,160
You know when you get to that place,

6075
02:49:57,161 --> 02:50:00,610
the great thing about that is you go
anywhere else and you're fucking golden.

6076
02:50:00,670 --> 02:50:01,210
Yeah.

6077
02:50:01,210 --> 02:50:05,590
The regular audiences will be so much
easier than the audiences that you deal

6078
02:50:05,591 --> 02:50:06,640
with on a weekly basis.

6079
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:07,290
The store,

6080
02:50:07,290 --> 02:50:07,800
Oh yeah.

6081
02:50:07,800 --> 02:50:10,440
Growing up like after 12 comics,

6082
02:50:10,860 --> 02:50:14,400
five six of them are just
like crushing crowds drunk.

6083
02:50:14,401 --> 02:50:15,870
They'd been there for three hours

6084
02:50:16,030 --> 02:50:19,540
and if anything topical happens
by the time you get up on stage,

6085
02:50:19,541 --> 02:50:21,580
it's been discussed 50 fucking times.

6086
02:50:22,060 --> 02:50:23,190
There was a onetime,

6087
02:50:23,260 --> 02:50:26,560
when Ari was working
there and the Chinese,

6088
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:31,510
a fighter pilot crashed with an American
fighter jet and the guy's name was Wong

6089
02:50:31,511 --> 02:50:32,344
way.

6090
02:50:32,440 --> 02:50:33,340
That was his name.

6091
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:35,170
W.

6092
02:50:35,170 --> 02:50:35,170
O.

6093
02:50:35,170 --> 02:50:35,170
N.

6094
02:50:35,170 --> 02:50:35,170
G.

6095
02:50:35,170 --> 02:50:35,560
Weei.

6096
02:50:35,560 --> 02:50:36,910
Everybody do a joke on it.

6097
02:50:36,911 --> 02:50:38,470
Nobody saw anybody else's sat.

6098
02:50:38,471 --> 02:50:40,390
But everybody came in and did a walk.

6099
02:50:40,470 --> 02:50:43,120
One way is this real life long way,

6100
02:50:43,121 --> 02:50:46,450
do you know the guy's name was Wong
Way and at a certain point in time the

6101
02:50:46,451 --> 02:50:46,871
audience is like,

6102
02:50:46,871 --> 02:50:47,980
are we being trolled?

6103
02:50:47,981 --> 02:50:49,370
Is this like an inside joke.

6104
02:50:49,910 --> 02:50:53,010
They not know that everybody before
them has done a long way joke.

6105
02:50:53,070 --> 02:50:53,903
Right.

6106
02:50:54,210 --> 02:50:58,440
Even Crowdwork sometimes if you go up
like where are you from and someone else

6107
02:50:58,441 --> 02:51:00,210
will answer like ice from Lancaster.

6108
02:51:00,270 --> 02:51:00,750
Yeah.

6109
02:51:00,750 --> 02:51:04,020
Fuck did you know cause
he's been asked 10 times.

6110
02:51:04,610 --> 02:51:07,980
I love the fact that this happened
because it seems like a lot of comics are

6111
02:51:07,981 --> 02:51:10,620
coming back to this place that didn't
really want it when it come to it.

6112
02:51:10,630 --> 02:51:10,951
By the way,

6113
02:51:10,951 --> 02:51:11,730
Tosh,

6114
02:51:11,730 --> 02:51:13,770
when did apologize for shaking your hand?

6115
02:51:13,830 --> 02:51:15,860
Weird last time you saw him Daniel.

6116
02:51:15,950 --> 02:51:16,783
Yeah,

6117
02:51:17,020 --> 02:51:17,551
but it was cool.

6118
02:51:17,551 --> 02:51:18,840
It like seeing tosh and seeing,

6119
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:19,560
yeah,

6120
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:19,861
he said,

6121
02:51:19,861 --> 02:51:20,910
he said tell Rogan,

6122
02:51:20,911 --> 02:51:22,710
I'm sorry but how I shook your hand.

6123
02:51:24,510 --> 02:51:25,680
He's an interesting guy.

6124
02:51:25,740 --> 02:51:26,490
He's a great guy.

6125
02:51:26,490 --> 02:51:27,460
He seemed very,

6126
02:51:27,461 --> 02:51:28,294
he loved that dude.

6127
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:29,230
He was,

6128
02:51:29,230 --> 02:51:31,760
he didn't shake my hand weird
at all what he's talking about.

6129
02:51:31,770 --> 02:51:34,770
He told me to say that to
comics are super sensitive

6130
02:51:34,830 --> 02:51:35,590
man.

6131
02:51:35,590 --> 02:51:36,780
Comics of super sensitive.

6132
02:51:36,781 --> 02:51:40,410
There's weird shit that'll stick in a
comics head and then they'll bring it up.

6133
02:51:40,411 --> 02:51:40,651
Like,

6134
02:51:40,651 --> 02:51:40,891
you know,

6135
02:51:40,891 --> 02:51:43,980
there was this time where I said this
thing and I probably shouldn't have said

6136
02:51:43,981 --> 02:51:45,750
any like what are you talking about?

6137
02:51:45,751 --> 02:51:47,310
Like I don't even know
what the fuck you said.

6138
02:51:47,510 --> 02:51:47,771
Yeah.

6139
02:51:47,771 --> 02:51:47,981
I called,

6140
02:51:47,981 --> 02:51:50,130
I made a joke about something
and I really didn't mean it.

6141
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:50,940
I'm like,

6142
02:51:50,940 --> 02:51:52,260
I don't remember it at all.

6143
02:51:52,261 --> 02:51:53,510
So it's like you're,

6144
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:56,940
you're carrying onto that like holding
onto like something they said that you

6145
02:51:56,941 --> 02:51:59,820
might misconstrue as
a slight or is a joke,

6146
02:51:59,821 --> 02:52:00,571
they might not take it.

6147
02:52:00,571 --> 02:52:03,510
Well some comics are like super sensitive.

6148
02:52:03,770 --> 02:52:04,460
Oh yeah.

6149
02:52:04,460 --> 02:52:05,260
Cause you saw,

6150
02:52:05,260 --> 02:52:06,011
you want to be like,

6151
02:52:06,011 --> 02:52:06,310
you know,

6152
02:52:06,310 --> 02:52:10,420
liked and respected and you're just like
always worried about saying the wrong

6153
02:52:10,421 --> 02:52:12,760
thing because no one knows who
you are yet and you're just like,

6154
02:52:12,780 --> 02:52:15,250
I want to make friends make
a good first impression.

6155
02:52:15,460 --> 02:52:15,810
But again,

6156
02:52:15,810 --> 02:52:16,643
like Daniel Tosh,

6157
02:52:16,810 --> 02:52:17,201
he shouldn't.

6158
02:52:17,201 --> 02:52:18,034
Oh yeah.

6159
02:52:18,250 --> 02:52:20,380
That's a weird multimillionaire.

6160
02:52:20,410 --> 02:52:21,010
I know.

6161
02:52:21,010 --> 02:52:21,670
Awesome.

6162
02:52:21,670 --> 02:52:22,540
Beautiful Man.

6163
02:52:23,110 --> 02:52:23,943
He's a good dude.

6164
02:52:24,040 --> 02:52:25,150
He's fun to be around too.

6165
02:52:25,240 --> 02:52:26,210
He's hilarious too.

6166
02:52:26,260 --> 02:52:27,250
He's like candor.

6167
02:52:27,460 --> 02:52:30,070
When you talked to him about
like other comedians and shit?

6168
02:52:30,071 --> 02:52:33,190
Like he was ragging on this one comedian
that he's had difficulties with and it

6169
02:52:33,191 --> 02:52:34,780
was God damned hilarious.

6170
02:52:35,170 --> 02:52:37,060
Brian Callen and I were crying laughing.

6171
02:52:37,061 --> 02:52:37,960
It was really funny.

6172
02:52:38,230 --> 02:52:38,950
That's funny.

6173
02:52:38,950 --> 02:52:39,940
It's very interesting.

6174
02:52:40,270 --> 02:52:41,290
But the um,

6175
02:52:41,320 --> 02:52:41,621
you know,

6176
02:52:41,621 --> 02:52:42,940
the Improv has guys like that.

6177
02:52:42,970 --> 02:52:43,840
They're there all the time.

6178
02:52:44,170 --> 02:52:46,600
I wonder if guys like they'll start
showing up at the store now too.

6179
02:52:46,670 --> 02:52:46,881
Yeah.

6180
02:52:46,881 --> 02:52:50,690
David spade was there yesterday
or did he stand up again?

6181
02:52:50,830 --> 02:52:51,420
I guess that was,

6182
02:52:51,420 --> 02:52:52,010
yeah.

6183
02:52:52,010 --> 02:52:52,843
How was it?

6184
02:52:53,150 --> 02:52:53,601
It was all right.

6185
02:52:53,601 --> 02:52:54,980
He was working on a couple of new bits.

6186
02:52:54,981 --> 02:52:55,071
Yeah.

6187
02:52:55,071 --> 02:52:56,270
Like notes up there with them.

6188
02:52:56,271 --> 02:52:56,860
So,

6189
02:52:56,860 --> 02:52:57,410
but the kid,

6190
02:52:57,410 --> 02:53:00,620
some funny stuff about like
going skiing for the first time.

6191
02:53:00,621 --> 02:53:04,790
He had like a story on that and all the
names of all the slopes were like these

6192
02:53:04,791 --> 02:53:07,740
like horrifying like evil names.

6193
02:53:07,741 --> 02:53:09,580
You're like Hitler's
abortion was the one of them.

6194
02:53:09,620 --> 02:53:10,221
Just stuff like that.

6195
02:53:10,221 --> 02:53:11,180
It was really funny.

6196
02:53:11,690 --> 02:53:14,090
But you could tell he was like
developing it and it's like,

6197
02:53:14,570 --> 02:53:17,660
it's interesting to see him when
I would lie to stand up live.

6198
02:53:17,910 --> 02:53:18,001
Well,

6199
02:53:18,001 --> 02:53:22,110
he probably like took some time
off doing a lot of TV and shit.

6200
02:53:22,111 --> 02:53:23,340
And then while those guys,

6201
02:53:23,341 --> 02:53:24,300
they lose their chops,

6202
02:53:24,301 --> 02:53:24,750
man,

6203
02:53:24,750 --> 02:53:25,260
they don't,

6204
02:53:25,260 --> 02:53:29,310
they have like a hard struggle
to try to get back getting back,

6205
02:53:29,670 --> 02:53:32,700
nor McDonald's been there if he
had arms becoming their love him.

6206
02:53:32,840 --> 02:53:33,673
I love him wrong.

6207
02:53:34,070 --> 02:53:34,430
Yeah.

6208
02:53:34,430 --> 02:53:35,330
If he comes up,

6209
02:53:35,331 --> 02:53:37,400
kidnap him and drag him to this podcast,

6210
02:53:39,350 --> 02:53:40,041
I'd love to do it.

6211
02:53:40,041 --> 02:53:40,874
But I wouldn't

6212
02:53:42,740 --> 02:53:44,350
say he's like,

6213
02:53:45,230 --> 02:53:45,620
he's a,

6214
02:53:45,620 --> 02:53:46,940
he's a character man.

6215
02:53:47,060 --> 02:53:47,900
He's a character.

6216
02:53:47,901 --> 02:53:49,730
We were on a plane with him once and uh,

6217
02:53:49,940 --> 02:53:51,020
all the way on the plane,

6218
02:53:51,200 --> 02:53:52,700
he's talking about how he quit smoking,

6219
02:53:53,330 --> 02:53:54,100
quit smoking gun.

6220
02:53:54,100 --> 02:53:57,710
I know he's like talking lands
immediately goes and buys cigarettes.

6221
02:53:58,070 --> 02:53:59,300
Brian let me buy him a cigarette.

6222
02:54:00,590 --> 02:54:04,040
He immediately ran and got a pack
of cigarettes and he was outside.

6223
02:54:04,050 --> 02:54:04,670
I sound,

6224
02:54:04,670 --> 02:54:05,630
I guess I'm smoking again.

6225
02:54:06,310 --> 02:54:07,610
It's so funny.

6226
02:54:08,990 --> 02:54:11,180
But the funniest guys are like that man.

6227
02:54:11,181 --> 02:54:12,140
They're just nutty,

6228
02:54:13,100 --> 02:54:13,730
nutty.

6229
02:54:13,730 --> 02:54:14,563
You know,

6230
02:54:14,900 --> 02:54:15,261
that's,

6231
02:54:15,261 --> 02:54:16,094
um,

6232
02:54:16,130 --> 02:54:17,330
that comes with the territory,

6233
02:54:17,331 --> 02:54:17,870
right?

6234
02:54:17,870 --> 02:54:21,170
So have you been asked a million times
if you'll go back to the comedy store now

6235
02:54:21,171 --> 02:54:21,850
that

6236
02:54:21,850 --> 02:54:22,900
at least 10.

6237
02:54:23,250 --> 02:54:23,680
All right.

6238
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:24,401
Not a million,

6239
02:54:24,401 --> 02:54:27,550
but at least 10 when do Friday
killed our Monday killed.

6240
02:54:27,610 --> 02:54:30,260
Tony's not was something happening,

6241
02:54:30,790 --> 02:54:31,623
but uh,

6242
02:54:31,630 --> 02:54:32,463
I'm happy.

6243
02:54:32,470 --> 02:54:33,360
I'm happy that uh,

6244
02:54:33,370 --> 02:54:34,750
the place we'll get more normal.

6245
02:54:34,920 --> 02:54:35,350
Yeah,

6246
02:54:35,350 --> 02:54:36,183
that's for sure.

6247
02:54:36,550 --> 02:54:38,410
And this would be more relaxed.

6248
02:54:38,411 --> 02:54:40,810
There's just too much insanity
there with that guy running shit.

6249
02:54:40,840 --> 02:54:41,410
Absolutely.

6250
02:54:41,410 --> 02:54:42,243
He was,

6251
02:54:42,310 --> 02:54:43,143
you know,

6252
02:54:43,360 --> 02:54:44,260
I don't hate the guy,

6253
02:54:44,440 --> 02:54:49,300
but there's just certain
levels of intolerable bullshit
where you're just like,

6254
02:54:49,301 --> 02:54:50,134
okay,

6255
02:54:52,260 --> 02:54:53,081
you're too crazy.

6256
02:54:53,081 --> 02:54:55,480
You were on this matter.

6257
02:54:55,760 --> 02:54:56,593
Hi.

6258
02:54:56,630 --> 02:54:56,931
Well,

6259
02:54:56,931 --> 02:54:57,560
you know,

6260
02:54:57,560 --> 02:55:00,500
but clip my more town to than anyone here.

6261
02:55:01,310 --> 02:55:02,143
Yeah.

6262
02:55:02,250 --> 02:55:04,850
Let's tell person in this building.

6263
02:55:04,970 --> 02:55:05,803
Yeah.

6264
02:55:05,840 --> 02:55:06,673
God.

6265
02:55:08,030 --> 02:55:09,710
Power and moneys behind me.

6266
02:55:09,720 --> 02:55:10,331
That's your hats.

6267
02:55:10,331 --> 02:55:11,780
And the building likes me.

6268
02:55:12,900 --> 02:55:13,733
No.

6269
02:55:16,230 --> 02:55:17,063
So happy.

6270
02:55:17,320 --> 02:55:18,153
Yeah.

6271
02:55:19,270 --> 02:55:20,470
Someone was saying like,

6272
02:55:20,500 --> 02:55:23,830
it would have been great if the way
they fired him was a Blake bringing them

6273
02:55:23,831 --> 02:55:25,270
into an office and they go like,

6274
02:55:26,140 --> 02:55:26,321
well,

6275
02:55:26,321 --> 02:55:27,131
it's not just that,

6276
02:55:27,131 --> 02:55:27,964
Tommy,

6277
02:55:28,240 --> 02:55:29,080
let's start with that.

6278
02:55:29,081 --> 02:55:30,060
And then they fire him.

6279
02:55:31,730 --> 02:55:32,200
Then he goes,

6280
02:55:32,200 --> 02:55:32,561
no,

6281
02:55:32,561 --> 02:55:33,281
it's not that.

6282
02:55:33,281 --> 02:55:35,740
It is just that this time you're done.

6283
02:55:35,860 --> 02:55:36,401
How much?

6284
02:55:36,401 --> 02:55:36,720
Um,

6285
02:55:36,720 --> 02:55:36,840

6289
02:55:41,080 --> 02:55:45,370
but I'm going to Chicago
with Ari the end of August.

6290
02:55:45,400 --> 02:55:46,233
Oh Shit.

6291
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:47,230

6292
02:55:47,260 --> 02:55:48,093

6293
02:55:48,110 --> 02:55:48,670
Zane.

6294
02:55:48,670 --> 02:55:49,540
He's downtown.

6295
02:55:50,020 --> 02:55:50,800
That's a good spot.

6296
02:55:50,800 --> 02:55:51,220
Yeah.

6297
02:55:51,220 --> 02:55:52,053
We're doing one night,

6298
02:55:52,750 --> 02:55:54,250
I'm going to hang out in the
city for a couple of days.

6299
02:55:54,280 --> 02:55:55,090
Beautiful.

6300
02:55:55,090 --> 02:55:56,530
I opened for Bobby still,

6301
02:55:56,590 --> 02:55:57,423
which is good.

6302
02:55:58,560 --> 02:55:59,200
Bobby flay.

6303
02:55:59,200 --> 02:55:59,661
Bobby Lee.

6304
02:55:59,661 --> 02:56:00,160
Yeah.

6305
02:56:00,160 --> 02:56:00,581
Beautiful.

6306
02:56:00,581 --> 02:56:00,731
Good.

6307
02:56:00,731 --> 02:56:02,020
Davinia he's a good dude.

6308
02:56:02,440 --> 02:56:02,651
Yeah,

6309
02:56:02,651 --> 02:56:03,490
he really is.

6310
02:56:03,940 --> 02:56:06,430
He's one of those guys that like is,

6311
02:56:06,880 --> 02:56:08,110
he's good to younger people.

6312
02:56:08,140 --> 02:56:08,860
You know,

6313
02:56:08,860 --> 02:56:10,120
a lot of guys like get,

6314
02:56:10,240 --> 02:56:12,490
get to the top or wherever
and then they're just like,

6315
02:56:12,491 --> 02:56:16,570
they did quit stand up or they don't
have any time for newer guys and stuff,

6316
02:56:16,571 --> 02:56:18,100
but he's always been super cool.

6317
02:56:18,770 --> 02:56:19,161
Yeah.

6318
02:56:19,161 --> 02:56:21,980
He got shit on a little
bit when he was coming up,

6319
02:56:21,981 --> 02:56:22,311
you know?

6320
02:56:22,311 --> 02:56:23,510
So I think because of that,

6321
02:56:23,511 --> 02:56:23,721
you know,

6322
02:56:23,721 --> 02:56:25,760
he had a bunch of issues
with guys that were,

6323
02:56:26,080 --> 02:56:30,980
that he was working with that just either
didn't pay him or fucked with them or,

6324
02:56:30,981 --> 02:56:31,550
so he's,

6325
02:56:31,550 --> 02:56:34,490
he's super nice to people
that are coming up now.

6326
02:56:35,180 --> 02:56:35,391
Yeah,

6327
02:56:35,391 --> 02:56:36,224
it's pretty great.

6328
02:56:36,230 --> 02:56:40,670
He takes care of comics and like he gives
like even like way new comics that are

6329
02:56:40,671 --> 02:56:40,821
like,

6330
02:56:40,821 --> 02:56:43,300
oh I'd like to like open free on
a local thing and he'll likely,

6331
02:56:43,330 --> 02:56:43,551
you know,

6332
02:56:43,551 --> 02:56:45,650
let them have a few minutes
just cause he knows,

6333
02:56:45,680 --> 02:56:46,070
you know,

6334
02:56:46,070 --> 02:56:47,090
he remembers what that was like.

6335
02:56:47,091 --> 02:56:51,020
Like doing an an not an open
mic of any kind and they'll,

6336
02:56:51,050 --> 02:56:52,280
this is going to be 80 people.

6337
02:56:52,281 --> 02:56:53,960
There are like 200 they're like,

6338
02:56:54,290 --> 02:56:55,123
you know,

6339
02:56:55,800 --> 02:56:56,510
and he's like,

6340
02:56:56,510 --> 02:56:57,980
cause it'll be like a something local.

6341
02:56:57,981 --> 02:56:58,281
And he's like,

6342
02:56:58,281 --> 02:56:58,371
yeah,

6343
02:56:58,371 --> 02:56:59,600
if I can come down to five minutes.

6344
02:56:59,610 --> 02:56:59,970
Yeah.

6345
02:56:59,970 --> 02:57:02,580
Camaraderie between comics
is one of the coolest things.

6346
02:57:02,760 --> 02:57:03,240
Yeah.

6347
02:57:03,240 --> 02:57:04,810
It's one of the coolest
things because it's a,

6348
02:57:04,811 --> 02:57:08,880
it's one of the things about the store
as well as a store because everybody,

6349
02:57:08,881 --> 02:57:12,880
we're all hung out there like really
foster that sort of camaraderie.

6350
02:57:13,190 --> 02:57:16,170
There was so much fun just in
that back parking lot area.

6351
02:57:16,171 --> 02:57:20,490
Just the hilarious conversations that
we've had back there that was just a,

6352
02:57:20,491 --> 02:57:22,890
it was a mad mad club
or we run out of time,

6353
02:57:23,040 --> 02:57:23,873
three minutes left,

6354
02:57:24,240 --> 02:57:25,590
three minutes and we turn into a pumpkin.

6355
02:57:25,591 --> 02:57:30,591
So everybody go by Nicu says
use of new CD and it is,

6356
02:57:30,751 --> 02:57:31,411
what is it called?

6357
02:57:31,411 --> 02:57:35,340
Why stop not owning this
stopped not owning this.

6358
02:57:35,610 --> 02:57:37,080
And is it available on iTunes?

6359
02:57:37,170 --> 02:57:39,180
It is on iTunes and all things.

6360
02:57:39,181 --> 02:57:42,450
comedy.com for those
of you who hate iTunes,

6361
02:57:42,451 --> 02:57:46,470
I also get more money if you buy it and
all things comedy.com but if you're an

6362
02:57:46,471 --> 02:57:46,981
iTunes guy,

6363
02:57:46,981 --> 02:57:47,701
totally go there.

6364
02:57:47,701 --> 02:57:49,650
It's on their rate it and review it.

6365
02:57:49,651 --> 02:57:50,461
I think that helps.

6366
02:57:50,461 --> 02:57:51,070
Right?

6367
02:57:51,070 --> 02:57:51,550
Yes,

6368
02:57:51,550 --> 02:57:52,460
that'll definitely help.

6369
02:57:52,490 --> 02:57:53,323
And this will help too.

6370
02:57:53,450 --> 02:57:54,390

02:58:06,180 --> 02:58:08,070

6382
02:58:08,820 --> 02:58:09,031

This is fun.

6386
02:58:10,890 --> 02:58:11,790
We got to do it more often.

6387
02:58:11,791 --> 02:58:12,240

6390

We learned so much about praying man
and almost like picture frat again.

6391
02:58:16,440 --> 02:58:18,590
I didn't know anything about
this was fun and it was actually,

6392
02:58:18,591 --> 02:58:20,070
it was sort of like work in some way.

6393
02:58:20,850 --> 02:58:22,140
I think we hijack the system.

6394
02:58:22,420 --> 02:58:23,700
Make use of ladies and gentlemen,

6395
02:58:23,850 --> 02:58:24,211
