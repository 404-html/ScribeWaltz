1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:03,370
I,

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,470
I've used it a sign.

4
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:05,161
I found myself,

5
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:06,210
his him from time to time,

6
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,640
just for the fuck of it and hangs it.

7
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,430
Feel good.

8
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,263
Hangover,

9
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,050
hangover.

10
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,750
You feel like a vampire
vampire is looked like right?

11
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:13,021
They look at,

12
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:14,910
they're hung over like
when the sun comes out of

13
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,600
fucking,

14
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,740
what a weird idea is that sometimes
you can have vampires that fall all the

15
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:26,430
vampire rules until real recently
people got so fucking arrogant.

16
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:27,120
They were like,

17
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,280
well,

18
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,461
no,

19
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:27,541
no,

20
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:27,721
no.

21
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:32,721
Now Vampires are actually your friend and
they only eat deer and they don't burn

22
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:33,750
when it's sunny out.

23
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,700
They just glisten and they
don't want to be glistening.

24
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,080
They sparkle Joe.

25
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:37,950
They don't listen.

26
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:42,450
They sparkle just vampires all of a sudden
became cool and you could fuck them.

27
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,710
Oh yeah dude.

28
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,120
Well that's Andrew Rice's fault.

29
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:45,361
Right?

30
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,510
And rise or phone.

31
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,520
Oh my God.

32
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,260
The fucking interview with a vampire.

33
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:49,900
No,

34
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,060
I don't think so man.

35
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:53,230
Because even before
interview with the Vampire,

36
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,140
Dracula was very sexual.

37
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,810
Dracula was a hypnotic.

38
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,230
Yeah,

39
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,500
he was a very sexual and like
a lot of the older movies,

40
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,551
you know,

41
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:03,330
there was a few of them.

42
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,081
The Gary Oldman.

43
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:04,831
What came first?

44
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,540
Gary Oldman or Anne Rice?

45
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,291
Probably in rice.

46
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:07,890
Right.

47
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,510
I don't want to Gary Oldman Dracula.

48
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,290
I think Anne Rice,

49
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,071
I'm always positive.

50
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:11,331
Actually.

51
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:13,290
I don't know the fucking Old Dracula,

52
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,190
I think the,

53
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:16,020
the Brahm Stoker Dracula.

54
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:16,651
Oh,

55
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:20,970
that was a long traps and the castle
didn't he have like there was a room you

56
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:24,100
went into and there are
all these female vampires.

57
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,020
Runyon hot.

58
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,103
Is that a call?

59
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,510
Yeah,

60
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,310
and like they were seductive
and they would like,

61
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:29,821
you know,

62
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:31,260
they were powerful Dracula.

63
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,810
That's the good point of what
everyone's hating on Dracula.

64
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:35,700
It's got these hard pitches
that want to suck blood.

65
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,060
They're ready to throw it out.

66
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,290
That's so funny.

67
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,200
Just gets a bone him.

68
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,110
He never bound them in
front of you buddy though.

69
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:41,550
It was just,

70
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,580
I guess once you start drinking people's
blood that's like way cooler than

71
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,423
bowling and checks.

72
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,270
He just completely give up on bowling.

73
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,140
I mean in the world of vampires,

74
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:52,710
it's that is boning the best
track live though of all time?

75
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,671
Unquestionably.

76
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,510
It was Gary Oldman.

77
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,860
Did you see that one?

78
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,760
I don't.

79
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,780
Bram stoker I sold.

80
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,160
It's so good that Kiana
Reeves can't fuck it up.

81
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,680
I got it like I don't know
cause I haven't seen it,

82
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,890
but I'll tell you my favorite fucking
vampire or the way I do like Keanu Reeves.

83
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,910
It's just as cheap joke.

84
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,950
I like calories.

85
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:10,943
It's true.

86
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,990
I love you can't,

87
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,481
Oh God,

88
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:14,010
I love you didn't pay
attention to my joke.

89
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:15,150
You just waiting to see
what you going to say.

90
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,253
I'll tell you why.

91
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,030
Here's where my mind started wandering
is you said the greatest vampire and then

92
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:24,421
I thought,

93
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:24,621
no,

94
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:24,721
no,

95
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,554
no.

96
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,930
The greatest vampire of all time.

97
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,120
The spookiest vampire about time.

98
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:31,620
It's fucking Nosferatu.

99
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,161
Oh,

100
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:32,731
the original.

101
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:33,240
Yeah,

102
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,810
you're right.

103
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,740
Fuck that thing.

104
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,341
We'll also,

105
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:37,530
that was like really original.

106
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,191
I mean,

107
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,900
and think about that guy did that.

108
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:40,321
It was like,

109
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,870
what else is a silent movie now?

110
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,260
Man,

111
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,440
that thing was a scary son of a bitch,

112
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:46,730
whatever.

113
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,280
That was like,

114
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,280
that's what a vampires like
the long fingers kind of
Goblin fucking creepy thing

115
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,890
pops out of the shadows.

116
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,700
That onsite dude,

117
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,441
keep talking.

118
00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,274
I love it.

119
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,213
Sorry my,

120
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,420
my yapping too much.

121
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:01,631
Oh,

122
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:02,200
I love it.

123
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,351
Oh,

124
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:02,861
you do?

125
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,390
Really?

126
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:03,821
Yeah,

127
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:04,241
man.

128
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:05,074
Last fed out to.

129
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,561
Yeah,

130
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:05,861
man,

131
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:06,820
that guy is fucking scary.

132
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:07,181
But you know,

133
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:11,680
the Salem's lot vampires are pretty
fucking spooky to 1922 brother,

134
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,630
1922 and I'm looking at
the images of it right now.

135
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,301
Oh my God.

136
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,040
It's fucking incredible.

137
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,260
Yeah.

138
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,170
It was legitimately frightening.

139
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,730
Legitimately frightening.

140
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,260
And it was in the fucking
early 19 hundreds dude.

141
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,080
Rentable.

142
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,050
And they find fucking coffin still too.

143
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,381
You know,

144
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:33,250
they found coffins out there are people
have hammered stakes into the Oh yeah.

145
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,001
Well there's probably,

146
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,670
I'm sure people that were fucking
assholes and they just wanted to make sure

147
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:37,960
that it really never came back.

148
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,600
But this motherfucker was creepy.

149
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,141
You're right,

150
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:41,680
man.

151
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:41,921
You know,

152
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,500
he might be the scariest whenever.

153
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,650
Yeah.

154
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,440
Especially when you consider
it was 90 fucking years ago.

155
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,041
Yeah.

156
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:48,371
Man,

157
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,210
that was fucking spit.

158
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:49,331
Well,

159
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,920
I mean now it's based on the real thing.

160
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,010
Whatever is wandering around out
in the fucking woods of Germany.

161
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:55,060
That's what was out there.

162
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,300
What a crazy people.

163
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,991
Do you remember?

164
00:03:58,991 --> 00:03:59,824
Uh,

165
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,281
it was,

166
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:00,580
uh,

167
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,200
it was based on a real man.

168
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:02,291
The,

169
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:02,891
Oh my God,

170
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:03,011
look,

171
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:04,210
there's fucking photo of it,

172
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,044
dude.

173
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,110
It's a really good goddamn image.

174
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,270
I didn't really fucking scary looking.

175
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:10,541
Yeah,

176
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,860
that's a scary vampire.

177
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,060
1922,

178
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,400
because if you go watch like King Kong,

179
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,600
King Kong is not really scary.

180
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,460
And that's a little from like the 30s.

181
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,000
Nope.

182
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,940
Not Scary at all.

183
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:20,740
And it's scary.

184
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,830
It can con can not fuck with Nosferatu.

185
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:25,721
No,

186
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:26,051
not,

187
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:26,530
I mean,

188
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,780
I guess if I had to pick
who I wanted to run from,

189
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:30,610
it's going to be a
fucking Nosferatu though.

190
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,541
But I weird.

191
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,940
Is it that they just hijacked
the whole vampire thing?

192
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,270
Vampires used to be the worst shit that
could ever happen to and now he's a

193
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,104
hunky guy.

194
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:38,321
Well,

195
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,330
I'll tell you why they
fucking did that shit,

196
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:41,164
bro in it.

197
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,520
Yeah.

198
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,000
You got to sell it to teenagers.

199
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,811
It's women,

200
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:44,520
men,

201
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,353
lot of women.

202
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,000
Well,

203
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,950
people that want the want romance,

204
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,800
right?

205
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,090
The,

206
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,241
uh,

207
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,740
the thing about the twilight books,

208
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,350
uh,

209
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,920
so I've been told by Mrs Rogan,

210
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,100
uh,

211
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,310
is that the very romantic,

212
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,540
unrealistically romantic because he's a
vampire and it's like he's got all the

213
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,980
super power and everything like that.

214
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,030
It's like he,

215
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:05,240
like he's giving it all up,

216
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:06,340
but just to be with her,

217
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,200
you know what I mean?

218
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,430
And it's this weird sort of like,

219
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,280
he,

220
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,270
he needs her so much and
women love that shit.

221
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,060
It's just a natural sort
of a thing for though.

222
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,630
So like when you see women that would be
waiting in line to go to those movies,

223
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,170
that just,

224
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,060
it just hits a chord that we don't,

225
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,200
we don't have,

226
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,460
we don't know that court,

227
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,860
but the Chica wrote that
shit knows their cord.

228
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,120
So she nailed it.

229
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,010
She talking about the quarter love,

230
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,250
I'm talking about the court
of affection and admiration.

231
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:38,080
Like I think all women want to be,

232
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,640
you know,

233
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,270
the w don't want to be worshiped,

234
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,170
you know,

235
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,840
they think that that's like the most
romantic thing for a guy who would do

236
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:44,674
anything for you.

237
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,260
So he would do anything for that girl in,

238
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,600
in,

239
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,490
in those books.

240
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,800
He would do anything for,

241
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,561
I mean he,

242
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:51,790
he didn't even want to bite her.

243
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,624
He wanted to,

244
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,270
he wanted to protect her from
everybody who was in love with her.

245
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,780
Meanwhile,

246
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,950
he was like a thousand years
old and she's in high school.

247
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,740
Like it's really fucking creepy
if you stop and think about it.

248
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,170
He's a thousand years old
or whatever the fuck it is.

249
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,870
I tell them she's in high school,

250
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:06,380
man,

251
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:06,591
you are.

252
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,980
You're fucking crazy kind of
conversations you're having with her.

253
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,750
Jesus Christ.

254
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:12,471
I mean,

255
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:17,180
it'd be hard enough if you were 30 you
were 30 and you're dating a girl in high

256
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:17,421
school,

257
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:17,750
you'd be like,

258
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,590
I got to kill myself.

259
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,453
I can't take it.

260
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,780
I can't talk to her.

261
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,300
She's fucking just shows.

262
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,250
All she wants to talk about is
Instagram thousand year old per se.

263
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,840
Fucking creeper ups.

264
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,510
He's a total creeper.

265
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,890
She could be as great Greg.

266
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,440
It's not like he just was
frozen for all those years.

267
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,400
Like captain America.

268
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,270
No,

269
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,470
this asshole's been alive the whole time
and pretend that he's in high school.

270
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,660
It might be one of the dumbest ideas ever.

271
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,840
It's not fair.

272
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:44,270
He's got magical powers.

273
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,110
He can fly.

274
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,530
He's flying a fucking high
school kid through the trees.

275
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:48,410
Jesus Christ.

276
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,430
Did they fuck?

277
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,601
Yes.

278
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:51,220
Eventually.

279
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,560
Yeah.

280
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,510
Later in the boiler spoiler.

281
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,403
Yes.

282
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,303
Allegedly.

283
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,540
How about that?

284
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:56,790
I Dunno.

285
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,931
It was.

286
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,590
It already happened.

287
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,400
It might have already happened.

288
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,780
I only saw like two of them.

289
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,980
I think there's been three of them.

290
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,090
Put it in her asshole.

291
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,550
I don't think they had
partial lot to do that.

292
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,160
It's a sin even for vampires.

293
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,913
Vampires.

294
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,753
No,

295
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,773
no,

296
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,643
no.

297
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,430
Females.

298
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:14,930
That project,

299
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,763
we'll cut the shape.

300
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,933
Just stop it.

301
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,040
They don't even shit anymore,

302
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,450
so it probably drives up nice,

303
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,810
don't shit.

304
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:24,650
When you're eating blood,

305
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,700
they probably barely have to urinate.

306
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,780
You probably get the
exact amount you need.

307
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,613
You don't know that.

308
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,840
I would imagine you would get
the exact amount you need now,

309
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,770
man of vampires.

310
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,870
Asshole is swollen.

311
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,830
Brogan.

312
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,330
A scene where you walked down into a New
York City subway and you saw some crazy

313
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:42,550
looking vampire dude.

314
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:43,880
You shitting blood,

315
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,990
which is blood squirting out of
his chunky cottage cheese blood.

316
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,400
That's what a vampire looks like.

317
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,003
Tunnel,

318
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,970
subway tunnel,

319
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:56,810
just shitting blood,

320
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,220
looking at you and thinking
about sucking your blood next.

321
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,170
It's weird like that's that.

322
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:04,070
That's as far as they go.

323
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:05,210
Like vampires suck your blood.

324
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:06,140
That's the worst thing they do,

325
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:09,350
but there's never been like a supernatural
creature that won't be like mouth

326
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:10,184
fucks you.

327
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,661
You know what I mean?

328
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:11,931
Some,

329
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:13,040
we talked about that before.

330
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,350
As ridiculous as it is.

331
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:17,510
I think we actually did
talk about this before.

332
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,340
It must be on my fucking mind,

333
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:19,600
man.

334
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,540
There's no fucking bat or
some creepy for rapes people.

335
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,860
There was mouth rape and dudes,

336
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,970
I don't use that word,

337
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,630
but it they're a fucking arm.

338
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,180
Horrifying,

339
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,320
horrifying being.

340
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:31,280
It doesn't have to be a vampire.

341
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:32,660
He could just be some bug,

342
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,530
some insect or something that came out
of the earth and that's how it does it.

343
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:37,364
It just fucking,

344
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,470
it made her,

345
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,850
it leaves off of the,

346
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,190
it lives off of like people gagging.

347
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,050
It absorbs the

348
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,260
gagging.

349
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,780
It gets power for the trick.

350
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:53,270
The twitching of your body when you're
trying to throw up gag pyre pipe is

351
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,620
clogged by fat cock.

352
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,460
You can't even throw up.

353
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,280
You're trying to throw up and he's just
holding the back of your head with Scaly

354
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,113
Paul.

355
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,200
That's what they came to do.

356
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:05,220
They just came to get head.

357
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,110
They have a really tough dicks.

358
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:10,350
Like you really cannot
even pierce the skin.

359
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,030
You can bite it as hard as you want.

360
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,460
It doesn't matter when
alien's face fuck you.

361
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,531
They just did.

362
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:16,380
It just goes in.

363
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,840
You accept it and it,

364
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:20,430
it just fucks your throat
when you try to throw up.

365
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,420
But he can't get past the fat alien
cock that's stretching your insides out,

366
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,380
pumping oxygen.

367
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,131
And by the way,

368
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,690
it's keeping you alive in you alive.

369
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,040
Why you suck at Scott's.

370
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,360
It changes your whole,

371
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,390
it blows your lungs out and
actually eats them and uh,

372
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,560
converts it to a type of glue that keeps
the cock attached to your body to keep

373
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:43,231
you alive.

374
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:44,970
Cause now you no longer have lungs.

375
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,480
You get all your oxygen through his cock.

376
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,450
Oh my God.

377
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:55,171
Could you imagine?

378
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:55,890
That would be the word.

379
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,090
And in some people would say,

380
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:57,690
you know what,

381
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,590
I don't care.

382
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,660
I love aliens anyway.

383
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,570
There's still awesome her teaching us.

384
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,310
Listen,

385
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,210
if for him might be really awesome,

386
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,930
maybe he loves the fact that he's
getting the oxygen to that cock.

387
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,220
You stay alive.

388
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,170
Your body where there's a
way you can't really move.

389
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:14,940
Your arms are flailing
and you like him paled,

390
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,970
you just look like a skeleton with a
fucking Dildo in its mouth and every year

391
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:22,080
it just goes deeper in your body,

392
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,520
keeps that keeps growing.

393
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,700
Eventually it turns into you,

394
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,510
you just turn it in like a
cactus like cactus Dick thing.

395
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,150
If you look at Sugar Bob Shish Kebab,

396
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,000
Dick Kebab every year the the,

397
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:33,490
the,

398
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,170
the Dick slowly grows inside your
body and starts cracking open.

399
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,780
Oregon's and pushing ribs to this side,

400
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,040
popping and snapping them as it
eventually goes through your body.

401
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,260
But it does it so slowly
that you never actually die,

402
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,460
especially since the,

403
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:47,581
uh,

404
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,290
the deck is providing with oxygen,

405
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,730
but then when it gets to the hat,

406
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,510
to the end,

407
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,600
the deck pops out of your asshole
and you deflate like a balloon.

408
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,141
And that,

409
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:58,310
and that sound is that
sound is known as funking.

410
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,440
Like it's like the sound
of a man's final farm.

411
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:02,430
There's no words sound.

412
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:04,160
It's like a pinky.

413
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:17,440
Okay.
