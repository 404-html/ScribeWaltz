1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,900
Four,
three,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,790
two,
one,

3
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:10,330
ladies and Gentlemen,
Michael Shermer and heavens on earth.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,950
The scientific search for the afterlife,
immortality and Utopia.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,170
Did you find anything?
No,

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,120
sorry.
Nothing.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,240
Well,
I found interesting journeys that people

8
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:25,810
use to try to get there from both the 
religious perspective and the scientific

9
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:27,430
perspective.
Um,

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,390
so I do deal with the monotheisms 
versions of the afterlife and heaven,

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,380
you know,
Judaism,

12
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:33,214
Christianity and Islam.
But the core of the book is the radical 

13
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:38,460
life extension is crayons,
transhumanist,

14
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,380
the Extropians,
the mind up loaders,

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,160
the people that take all the supplements
and all of the whole range there.

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,430
I find that incredibly interesting.
They call it an afterlife or atheists.

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,140
It is,
right?

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,010
Yeah.
I mean when,

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,200
when you think about some of the people 
that are really like over the top hope,

20
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,850
did you go to that 20,
45 thing in New York a few years back?

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,133
There was a futurist convention with all
these people that for whatever reason 

22
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:05,060
they have this arbitrary date of 20,
45 years.

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,600
It's been getting pushed back.
This is when the singularity come,

24
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,390
he's going to cut,
was 20 slash 30,

25
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:12,070
then 20,
40 now 45.

26
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,490
Um,
Kurzweil Kurzweil big.

27
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,220
He's like the Grand Poobah.
He is no download it.

28
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,363
And when he gets on stage now he's not 
Predator naturally dynamic like a 

29
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:26,770
preacher,
but he starts talking about,

30
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:28,720
you know,
we're gonna get to live forever.

31
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,060
You're going to have your mind uploaded.
And people are just like,

32
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,090
oh my God,
we are the generation that's going to do

33
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:35,410
it.
This is the first time.

34
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,221
And the mom,
you know,

35
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,320
I used to be religious in my youth and I
thought,

36
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,630
man,
this is like being back in church again.

37
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,090
She stopped being religious.
Uh,

38
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:45,580
I started in high school and stopped in 
graduate school,

39
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:46,630
so it was much seven.

40
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,010
You started being religious in high 
school,

41
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,030
so it wasn't something that your family 
introduced.

42
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,360
My parents were pretty secular.
They,

43
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,950
they weren't antireligious at what?
That wasn't a thing then,

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,190
but this is 1971 when I was in high 
school and the,

45
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:01,024
and the sort of nascent born again 
movement was starting and there was no 

46
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:05,440
religious affiliation.
It was just like,

47
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:06,940
it's me and Jesus,
that's it.

48
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,300
It's just you and the Lord.
There's a lot of these,

49
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:12,430
um,
very charismatic hip,

50
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,323
young preachers that are doing sort of a
thing like that where they don't even 

51
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:17,524
have their own church to like rent time 
and the church and they have these 

52
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,993
meetings where it's not,
it's just nondenominational and they 

53
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,680
just talk about God and yet they get a 
lot of people fired up.

54
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,000
Yep.
And you know,

55
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:31,370
they,
they,

56
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,320
the place I went to this place called 
the barn in Locker Santa where I grew up

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,220
in,
you know,

58
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:40,000
they played guitar and sang to a sex 
cult.

59
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,020
It was kind of only starts banging.
I was hoping for something like that.

60
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:44,854
But no,
no,

61
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,093
no.
That,

62
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,093
that,
that is one of the problems with the 

63
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:50,740
utopia that 19th century utopian 
experiments,

64
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:52,120
they always turned into this,
you know,

65
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:53,840
free sex for the leader.
Well,

66
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:54,674
it always seems like whenever there's a 
man that's in a position where people 

67
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:59,890
start worshiping,
you know,

68
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,350
and then they start hanging on his every
word.

69
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:03,330
He's like,
start you gotta.

70
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,920
Start fucking some of these people.
Well,

71
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:08,280
I do,
I covered Jim Jones and uh,

72
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,960
you know,
the way I phrase it is that no one joins

73
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:11,794
a cult.
They join a group that they think is 

74
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:14,314
going to do good,
save the world can help me improve my 

75
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,710
life,
improve the lives of others.

76
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,933
And there's pictures online.
You can see if Jim Jones with Jerry 

77
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,270
Brown,
governor Jerry Brown first round and you

78
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:24,730
know,
they were man in the soup kitchens.

79
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,563
He was very liberal,
open to African Americans being part of 

80
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,950
the church in San Francisco.
They're gays women.

81
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,001
Uh,
you know,

82
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:31,834
it was a really cutting edge,
pioneering thing at the time it seemed 

83
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:34,481
like,
yeah,

84
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,530
that,
that's a cool thing.

85
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,450
I'm going to join this group.
Not that me,

86
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,284
but you know,
the people that did this in the fifties 

87
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:43,060
and sixties when he was coming up and 
then into the seventies and then,

88
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,200
then,
yeah,

89
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,810
he started having sex and drugs and then
the,

90
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:47,644
you know,
the feds started kind of poking around 

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,780
taxes and that's when they went to South
America speaking,

92
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,610
which I think this week is the spike 
special.

93
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:57,140
It's now the paramount network on Waco.
Waco,

94
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,960
this isn't that right now.
I think it's like a started Sunday.

95
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:02,561
Yeah.
Yeah.

96
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:06,220
I think it's a six part series or 
something along those lines.

97
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,250
See,
that's an interesting.

98
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,290
Uh,
I'm,

99
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,820
I'm absolutely convinced most of these 
guys believe what they say now.

100
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,663
Maybe,
maybe they're bullshitters at the start 

101
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,040
or they only partially believe,
but they,

102
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,983
they repeat the rhetoric.
Their followers give them positive 

103
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,230
reinforcement.
They come to believe it.

104
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,370
And uh,
you know,

105
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,950
David Koresh,
he was right down the barrel.

106
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:24,784
He totally believed,
willing to die for his beliefs and he 

107
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,260
also was having sex with everybody.

108
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,680
I mean,
it's so common.

109
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,323
It's almost cliche.
And his ex girlfriend grew up in one of 

110
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:39,400
these sort of religious cults and it was
the same deal.

111
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,360
The head guy was having sex with all the
women and you know,

112
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:44,194
he would have sex with different 
people's wives and everybody had a lead 

113
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,390
them.
Yeah.

114
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,840
Say there was a fundamentalist Mormons.
Um,

115
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,530
what's his name that's in jail now?
Jeff.

116
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,443
Jeffrey.
Jeff,

117
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,320
Jeff,
Jeff,

118
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,821
Jeff,
Jeffrey,

119
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:56,920
Jeff,
Steve Jeffries.

120
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,930
It is.
I'm thinking of Jim Jefferies,

121
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,830
my friend,
the comedian.

122
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,261
But anyway,
yeah,

123
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:02,801
that's,
you know,

124
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:05,420
that's how it gets corrupted.
I don't know if you've ever read John.

125
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,260
I'm John Crack hours book under the 
banner of Heaven.

126
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,123
This is the guy that,
that mountain climber that did a into 

127
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,130
thin air and,
and uh,

128
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,610
and the,
um,

129
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,880
the one about the Alaskan kid.
Anyway,

130
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:18,550
he wrote this book called under the 
banner of the kid who died.

131
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,463
Yes.
When they made that movie about moving 

132
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,930
into the wild.
Yeah.

133
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:26,050
So he did into the wild into thin air.
Krakauer's a great writer.

134
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:26,884
So this book,
he starts to investigate the murder of 

135
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,400
this,
um,

136
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,310
polygamous family in Utah,
just as a journalist.

137
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,380
He's going to do a story for the New 
Yorker or something.

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,513
And then he realized it just takes them 
down the path of this incredible world 

139
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:42,100
of polygamy,
which still goes on now legally it's not

140
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:42,934
illegal,
but they marry one and then the others 

141
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:48,070
are so called sister wives and they're 
just there and they live on these,

142
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:51,430
in these border towns along the border 
between Colorado and Utah,

143
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,950
like Colorado city.
You know,

144
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,850
I've been to some of these places.
It's like a,

145
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,820
it's like a twilight zone episode.
You go into this town gas station,

146
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,361
whatever.
It's like,

147
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,980
oh,
it feels kind of weird here.

148
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,263
And uh,
so krakauer discovered this whole world 

149
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:04,520
of,
you know,

150
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,180
going all the way back to the founding 
of the religion.

151
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,760
And um,
uh,

152
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,790
what's the name Joseph Smith and you 
know,

153
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,130
he gets this revelation from God that,
uh,

154
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,900
well basically he's banging the woman 
down the street,

155
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:18,734
he's married.
And so he gets this revelation from God 

156
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:23,780
and crack era has this scenario in the 
book where he,

157
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,550
he tells his wife,
now,

158
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,384
honey,
I've been talking to God and you're not 

159
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:29,300
going to believe this,
but he says,

160
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,680
I have to marry this,
you know,

161
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,770
so,
and so down the street.

162
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:32,900
And she's like,
Oh yeah,

163
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,810
well I have to start seeing other guys.
No,

164
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:37,644
no.
God was very specific about this just 

165
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:41,510
for the guys.
And uh,

166
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:43,820
and how do I know you talked about.
Well,

167
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:44,840
my buddies,
they were there.

168
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:45,674
They heard it also.
And this is the first page of the book 

169
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:49,430
of Mormon is an affidavit.

170
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,293
These are the people that heard the 
revelation that they all signed it and 

171
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:54,321
it's like,
okay,

172
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:55,154
so this is how it starts.
When Joseph Smith started it all off in 

173
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:57,900
18,
20,

174
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,690
he was only 14.
Yeah,

175
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,430
so 14 year old is not a liar.
I just learned that a lie.

176
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,500
It's not even like that.
They're bad people.

177
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,350
When you're 14 years old,
you are a developing entity.

178
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,260
You know your frontal lobes are not 
fully formed.

179
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:14,780
You don't really know what you're 
practicing sentences,

180
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,530
you know what you're doing,
trying to exert your influence,

181
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:23,531
and this guy was just very creative.
He was and he got chased out of Palmyra.

182
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:24,614
New York is where he started and then he
moved to Missouri when basically he was 

183
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,064
in trouble with the law and and other 
issues and then he got in trouble there 

184
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:35,870
and he was killed and it usually,
this ends a cult when the leader dies.

185
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,590
Now there's a,
there's a,

186
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,970
there's a critical period if you get a 
new dynamic leader to take over.

187
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:41,804
Like in the case of scientology,
David miscavige took over after l Ron 

188
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,730
Hubbard passed over to the other side 
and he managed to keep it going.

189
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,593
Same thing with Brigham Young.
It was bringing young that turned this 

190
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:52,634
little cult into a a world religion and 
they just went further west to Utah to 

191
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:58,490
get away from federal authorities.
Now,

192
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:01,760
how much of a hit is scientology taking 
from that?

193
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:04,150
Leah Remini?
I don't.

194
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,970
I've not seen any data like a 
memberships and they're all secret about

195
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:08,391
that.
Anyway.

196
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:10,220
It's proprietary data,
so who knows?

197
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,310
I can't imagine they could survive.
Well,

198
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,144
they could survive because they have 
tons of money through real estate 

199
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:16,784
investments,
but I can't imagine their numbers or 

200
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,440
could be doing anything but drinking.
Yeah.

201
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,820
Between the Lawrence Wright book than 
the Hbo Documentary Feature.

202
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,340
The crispy and your dialogue with 
Aaliyah was incredible and cheese.

203
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:34,310
Just to hero amongst secular.
Is that fight against colts?

204
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,190
That's really.
That's really the best way to do it.

205
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,730
Not top down laws against cults unless 
they're doing something,

206
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,930
he'll obviously illegal,
but just bottom up members speaking.

207
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,320
I had David Miscavige has dad on as 
well.

208
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,420
That was,
that was sad.

209
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
That was sad because I felt like I was 
talking to a guy who felt like he wasted

210
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:56,100
his life and lost

211
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,020
his son.
Right.

212
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,870
And he brought his son into scientology.
The whole thing was.

213
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,050
That was really disturbing.
Yep.

214
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,553
Just A.
It's just very strange that the United 

215
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,650
States government is allowing those 
people to be tax exempt.

216
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,870
I mean,
with all the evidence that's available,

217
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,883
you just go and look at what they're 
proposing and what they believe and the 

218
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:22,490
fetus and the frozens entities,
they're dropped into the volcano.

219
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:24,340
All the crazy shell.
The story about there,

220
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,300
this is what really worried me about the
irs.

221
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,470
I mean,
I've always thought,

222
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:30,900
you know,
I don't fear it hell or the devil,

223
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:32,230
but I figured the irs,
you know,

224
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,750
I take.
I'm pretty careful about that,

225
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,823
but they're the only major organization 
I've ever seen that beat the irs and 

226
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:40,170
they did it through a thousands of 
lawsuits.

227
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:41,004
I think they sued him like 3,500 times 
or something and every single member 

228
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:47,550
that they could get to do it to them as 
well.

229
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,580
They were getting all their members to 
suicide.

230
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,300
They were suing.
That was the story.

231
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:52,830
Isn't that how it worked?
Yeah.

232
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,290
And eventually the irs has said,
okay,

233
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,530
if I get your tea,
your tech.

234
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,473
But I mean if they're letting the 
Mormons do it and why wouldn't they let 

235
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,160
the scientists do and I really don't 
think any religion.

236
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,140
It's ridiculous.
I agree.

237
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,230
I mean in 2018 with what we know about 
reality,

238
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,370
the fact that we let some old voodoo 
superstitious nonsense,

239
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,423
right?
Not have to pay taxes and exert extreme 

240
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,710
power politically,
socially,

241
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,810
economically.
It's crazy.

242
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,831
Well,
so.

243
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,420
And they like preachers get it.
They could,

244
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,293
they can live in a house tax free,
then have to pay property tax on the 

245
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,810
home that they own,
you know?

246
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,120
So there's a lot of these side benefits 
also that you don't normally hear about.

247
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:32,963
So gross.
So the freedom from religion foundation 

248
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,580
and some of these other organizations.
Acu trying to combat some of this,

249
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,770
but,
but legally,

250
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,633
how do you distinguish that from say a 
nonprofit like doctors without borders 

251
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:46,650
or one of these other groups?
That Clinton Foundation?

252
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,193
Yeah.
There was some statistic recently and 

253
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:55,410
the Clinton Foundation,
how much money and not in 2014.

254
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:58,410
They actually donated to Cherry.
Oh Christ.

255
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,950
It was like six percent.
Something like extremely low.

256
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,780
The rest of it with payroll and.
Yeah,

257
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:05,340
mostly expenses.
Private.

258
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,670
They're scams.
All these things are scams.

259
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,900
Yeah.
It's just,

260
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,093
yeah,
it might be good to just clean house 

261
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:12,684
and,
and just.

262
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,110
No one gets a nonprofit or tax free 
status.

263
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,270
Yeah.
Unless you're just.

264
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,560
Well,
I don't know.

265
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,413
I mean I feel like there was room in the
world for compassionate charities that 

266
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,740
are actual charities that are really 
legitimate.

267
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,693
There's room in the world for them and I
think that they should have tax exempt 

268
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:30,174
status,
but I think we should be really 

269
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,680
stringent.
Right.

270
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,500
You know about what we accept.
Yeah.

271
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:35,334
Well the Supreme Court then they have a 
pr problem is where do you draw the 

272
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,450
line?
Do you know?

273
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:40,320
Because somebody says,
well,

274
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:43,740
I have a goofy belief that the Jane's 
have some weird beliefs or something,

275
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:44,570
but you know,
but,

276
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,403
but they're man in the soup kitchens,
they're helping the poor and there's no 

277
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:47,994
corruption.
So what's the difference between them 

278
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:51,300
and the scientologists who say,
Hey,

279
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,433
you know,
we have our own religious beliefs that 

280
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,100
to

281
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,250
use sound goofy,
but you know,

282
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,460
to us they're true.
What's the difference?

283
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,403
Well,
the Mormons are fascinating to me 

284
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:03,840
because they do seem goofy when you look
at the idea that Joseph Smith,

285
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,703
who was a 14 year old found golden 
tablets that contained a loss work of 

286
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:11,790
Jesus and only he could read them 
because he had a magic seer stone.

287
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,940
And then when the,
the local townspeople came to see,

288
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:15,930
well,
where are these stones?

289
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,793
Oh,
the angels came and took them away 

290
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:20,700
because we did not believe like it's so 
preposterous.

291
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,390
But Mormons are really nice people.
Totally Nice.

292
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,000
They are the best cult.
They're the sweetest,

293
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:29,190
nicest place.
I think they've made the transition from

294
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:33,090
coal to religion to a religious sect.
And most,

295
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,650
most Christians no longer consider them 
a cult.

296
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:37,540
Some evangelicals do because they're 
pretty far out,

297
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,070
but most mainstream Christian say,
yeah,

298
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:40,811
yeah,
they're Christians.

299
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:41,644
I mean,
they accept Jesus as their savior and 

300
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,250
that technically that gets you in the 
club.

301
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,810
They start to let all that Joseph Smith 
stuff go.

302
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,703
Yeah.
Because they're the way they treat 

303
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,220
people's fantastic.
I mean,

304
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:53,510
yeah,
I'm not a big fan of them going to these

305
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:56,470
poor countries and proselytizing and you
know,

306
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,600
getting these vulnerable people to 
become part,

307
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,613
but I think the way they deal with 
community and the way they deal with 

308
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:04,590
each other,
it's like a very.

309
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,020
It's a very warm and friendly and family
environment and most of the Mormons that

310
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:09,854
I've met that are practicing have been 
very nice people and they're serious 

311
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:16,940
about their tithing and the 10 percent.
I mean they have strict rules about this

312
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:19,140
like capital gains that it's equivalent 
capital.

313
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,110
So if you sell your house and make a 
profit,

314
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:22,490
you got to give 10 percent of that to 
church,

315
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,350
not just your income,
your paycheck,

316
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,090
and they.
They're pretty,

317
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,260
pretty strict about that.

318
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,030
And the money,
as far as I know,

319
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,020
mostly goes for good causes that really 
does help poor people,

320
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,940
things like that.
So in your book,

321
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,450
did you go over near death experiences?
I have a chapter on that.

322
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,040
What do you think is going on?
Like when people like the ones that have

323
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,293
fascinated me or people in the hospital 
bed that see their body from above and 

324
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,500
you're dealing with a bunch of chemicals
that are released in the body,

325
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:52,334
right?
There's morphine and all sorts of 

326
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:54,404
different things,
psychedelic chemicals and all the 

327
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,140
different things that are happening 
while your brain is,

328
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,080
is basically on the edge of death,

329
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,103
right?
So it's important to remember that 

330
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,590
they're near death experiences.
You're not actually dead.

331
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,453
So there's,
there's a luminal transitional stage 

332
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:14,430
there where you're sliding into some 
other state of consciousness,

333
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,653
altered state of consciousness.
And we know that if you inject or you 

334
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,240
take hallucinogens,
you know those are molech.

335
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:26,310
Those are molecules that operate on a 
lock and key mechanism with the synapses

336
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:29,620
in your brain and your neurons.
So if they,

337
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,540
these external drugs work in this 
molecular lock and key mechanism,

338
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:38,370
there must be natural chemicals similar 
molecularly to that in the brain already

339
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,353
just in smaller doses.
So one theory about near death 

340
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:42,444
experiences is that a,
is that this is a way of transitioning 

341
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:46,254
from living dead without feeling anxious
and falling apart and upset and 

342
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:53,270
depressed or whatever.
Just kind of a smooth feel good,

343
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,453
you know,
better than a morphine drip kind of way 

344
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:57,170
of making the transition.

345
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,510
And uh,
but we know for example,

346
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:00,344
that this,
a scientist named Dr James wintery 

347
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:06,050
worked for the United States air force 
working with pilots,

348
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:06,884
accelerating them in a centrifuge and 
they would black out this part of their 

349
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:10,460
training,
you know,

350
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,510
two g,
three G,

351
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,660
four g boom out you go at some point,
like 10 g's.

352
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,280
And most of them have these little 
dream.

353
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:20,510
Let states that he called them,
which are kind of like a.

354
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,970
I saw a tunnel of white light at the end
of the tunnel.

355
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:23,804
I felt myself floating out of the seat 
and having these sort of weird 

356
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:29,090
experiences and we know exactly what 
that is.

357
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:29,924
You know,
the blood is being compressed to the 

358
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:33,260
center of the body,
including the center of the brain.

359
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,150
The last thing to go is your brainstem,
of course,

360
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,013
keep you alive.
So the Cortex is shutting down from the 

361
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:38,690
outside in.

362
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,630
That would create this kind of tunneling
effect on the back of your skull,

363
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:44,090
where your visual Cortex is that create 
some of that,

364
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,640
uh,
open brain surgeries.

365
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:47,474
These are on epileptic patients where 
they cut them open and they poke around 

366
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:53,270
to see where the seizures are starting.
Um,

367
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,260
and,
and so they could,

368
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,570
you know,
zap those neurons instead of some big,

369
00:15:56,571 --> 00:16:00,170
crude a attack and anyway,
so while they're doing that,

370
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:01,004
they get permission from the patient to 
wake them up while they're under a and 

371
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,770
the brain is open and they tap around 
with electrodes.

372
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,900
So this is one way to map the brain is 
doing.

373
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,060
If so,
what do you report when I tap here?

374
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:11,923
Oh,
I just had a vision of my 10th birthday 

375
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:14,510
or whatever.
And it's like,

376
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:15,470
okay,
that's where that,

377
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,870
that stored right there.
Well,

378
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:19,680
there's another spot right on the,
um,

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,833
the temporal lobes just above your ears 
where you can tap it and the person 

380
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:24,321
says,
Oh,

381
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:25,370
I'm floating out of my body.

382
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,203
I'm up by the ceiling now.
And you tap it a little to the left on 

383
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:30,490
my left leg is up,
my right leg is that night.

384
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,363
My left arm is floating in.
My right arm is floating way up here 

385
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,260
now.
Now I'm coming back down just by,

386
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,230
you know,
with a Rheostat,

387
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,083
just controlling how much electricity is
going into the neurons in that one 

388
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:41,684
particular spot.
So we know for sure that the near death 

389
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:45,614
experiences are in the brain and the 
experiences that the people report are 

390
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,350
real.
They have experienced,

391
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,720
um,
but we know it's neurologically based.

392
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,170
Now the counter argument is yes,
of course you have to have your brain to

393
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:58,004
have experiences,
but it's kind of a like a doors of 

394
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:04,190
perception opening into this other realm
that these chemicals allow you to do.

395
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,260
It's like it was,
by the way,

396
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:09,020
I've been talking with Graham Hancock 
about Alaska.

397
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,060
He's invited me to come join him and 
Arrhythmia in Costa Rica to try this,

398
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,860
you know,
I've never tried this and I'm tempted to

399
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:17,150
go do this to say,
okay,

400
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:18,920
let's,
I'm going to write about these things.

401
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:21,110
I should experience it.
And,

402
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:23,270
but there's a debate amongst people who 
do this,

403
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,310
that you know,
it.

404
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,163
Is it strictly just in your head and 
you're not actually going anywhere or 

405
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,030
does it open some door to some other 
dimension?

406
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:32,880
Okay.
That's Kinda the.

407
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,770
And um,
and so the near death experience,

408
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:38,750
believers counter that will,
yes,

409
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:39,584
it's in your brain,
but it still is taking you somewhere 

410
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:43,440
else.
The problem is,

411
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,200
is that how you tell the difference 
between.

412
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,093
I had a personal experience that the 
only way you can share it as if you 

413
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:49,514
actually go through it yourself for a 
scientific community that studies as 

414
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,243
well.
There has to be some way to test it 

415
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:57,120
somehow or tell the difference between 
that.

416
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,060
So for example,
the limitations of the scientific method

417
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:00,894
does because we are dealing with 
consciousness and you're dealing with 

418
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,840
memories and dreams and ideas.
Like you can't measure those either.

419
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,823
That's right.
So,

420
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,320
uh,
I quote go to other sources.

421
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,191
Okay.
So first of all,

422
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,024
I discussed the most famous example is 
even Alexander's a trip to have and he 

423
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,494
wrote a book called proof of Heaven.
Now this is a harvard trained 

424
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,164
neurologist.
He knows more about the brain than I do 

425
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,833
and so he knows all the research I'm 
talking to you about and there's a lot 

426
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:25,044
more.
So.

427
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,140
But for him it was so powerful and okay,
what's it like?

428
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,440
So he talks about in his book he was in 
a coma,

429
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,730
in a hospital.
Okay.

430
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:37,731
So he takes this trip and the colors 
were unbelievably intense and rich and I

431
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:42,861
felt just deep personal love for the 
people I saw in oneness with the cosmos.

432
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,010
And it goes on and on about this.
So then I quote from Oliver Sacks,

433
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:47,844
his memoir when the talks about in the 
sixties when he was dropping acid and 

434
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:54,300
you know,
the colors were incredibly intense and I

435
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,134
had this incredible feeling of love and 
connected and I quote from Sam Harris's 

436
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,270
the opening pages of waking up.
You know,

437
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:01,104
I took ecstasy and I'm sitting there on 
the couch with my buddy and all of a 

438
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:05,540
sudden I feel this intense love for my 
friends.

439
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,773
In other words,
you know,

440
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,390
the narratives are indistinguishable to 
an outsider.

441
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,733
So how do you know that you're actually 
going to heaven or you're just having a 

442
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:14,270
fantastic trip?
Well,

443
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,110
it's entirely possible.
It's both.

444
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,750
Well,
so how do we know?

445
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,003
We don't know that.
I think the real problem is people 

446
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:23,300
saying that they know.
Right?

447
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,320
Right.
Saying that I know that I was in another

448
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:26,154
dimension.

449
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,853
I mean,
it's entirely possible that your 

450
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:33,810
consciousness is capable of going 
through these chemical doorways that are

451
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:38,811
created by these molecules and that it 
experiences some frequency on the,

452
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,420
on the dial.
Like if there's a radio dial,

453
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,950
maybe we're at 95 point five,
but you can get to 97 if you take,

454
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,230
you know,
x amount of milligrams of diamonds,

455
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,750
tryptamine and then you go to this new 
place.

456
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,703
You know,
this still physically here and Elvis 

457
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,330
Huxley's book the doors of perception.
Yes.

458
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,400
Which supposedly is where the door has 
got their name,

459
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:02,910
but somebody told me that that's a meme.
That's not true,

460
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:03,744
but I don't know.
Anyway,

461
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,130
but that's the idea.
Yeah,

462
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,680
sounds good.
So,

463
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:12,681
but really what you're getting at is a 
super core problem of what is truth,

464
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,603
how do you know that it was so mystical 
experiences are by definition personal 

465
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,580
and you can't corroborate them through 
some external scientific method.

466
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,670
So I mean science is based on the,
on the,

467
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,540
on the act that we can falsify a claim,
we can test it somehow and that it's not

468
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,374
just me pointing to something and say,
I think that's true because I 

469
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:35,530
experienced that,
you know.

470
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,490
So I wrote a column in scientific 
American about this called.

471
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:40,720
What is truth is I started off with a 
lie.

472
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,280
The truth for me is that dark 
chocolate's better than milk chocolate.

473
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,213
Then maybe you say no,
milk chocolate's better than dark 

474
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,763
chocolate and then you know,
there's no way we're going to resolve 

475
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:51,510
that because the truth is that that's 
just preference.

476
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,403
That's just,
that's an internal state or I say the 

477
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:55,440
other example I use is,
you know,

478
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:57,610
the stairway to heaven is the greatest 
rock song of all time.

479
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:58,211
Then you go,
no,

480
00:20:58,211 --> 00:20:59,960
no,
freebird is better than stairway to.

481
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,490
Okay.

482
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,900
You can't resolve these things.
Right.

483
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:06,430
So you slide there from into things like
these personal experiences we have.

484
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,880
So you know,
so what I think Graham is hoping if I go

485
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:12,940
to rhythmia and try Iowaska and I say,
wow,

486
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:13,774
I report this fantastic experience I had
was literally I'll have this and then 

487
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:18,214
it'll be,
we'll did I Michael Shermer go to this 

488
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:20,824
other dimension and now I really kind of
as a skeptic need to renounce my pure 

489
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:27,040
materialistic,
monistic a belief in,

490
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:27,520
in,
in,

491
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,800
in admit there's a dualistic.
That's another side.

492
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:30,634
There's the spirit side or something and
I'm not at all sure I could do that 

493
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,580
because how would I get out of my own 
head and say,

494
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:39,520
I know for sure that I went to this 
other place because I wouldn't know

495
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,530
you.
Most certainly don't know you,

496
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,383
you,
you know that the experience was a real 

497
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:48,070
experience in terms of the fact that you
had it like you,

498
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,380
you felt the things.
I haven't done Iowasca,

499
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:52,214
but I've done the active ingredient and 
Iowasca many times it's 

500
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:57,300
dimethyltryptamine and it's more potent 
in the form that I've done in it.

501
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,910
It's a shorter,
lasting,

502
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:03,911
much more potent experience and it's 
undeniably phenomenal.

503
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,730
Really.
It is very crazy.

504
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,623
It's impossible to describe.
I would throw some words around and do 

505
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:12,670
my best,
but it won't work.

506
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,860
Right.
The trip itself,

507
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,023
what's really bizarre,
there's a lot of really bizarre aspects 

508
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:19,354
of it,
but one of the things is really bizarre 

509
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,823
is the feeling that you've been there 
before him and the speculation and 

510
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,860
Terence Mckenna talked about this pretty
in depth.

511
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,143
One of the,
one of the speculations is that when 

512
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:33,510
you're in rem sleep,
you're experiencing some form of dime,

513
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:38,020
Ethel tryptamine in that your brain,
your liver,

514
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:38,230
your.

515
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,230
They know for a fact that it's produced 
by your liver and your lungs,

516
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,933
and now they know the used to be 
anecdotal evidence that was produced by 

517
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:46,024
the pineal gland,
which is of course the third eye in 

518
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:50,740
reptiles and certain reptiles that 
actually has a retina.

519
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,793
We didn't literally is in the center of 
your head where the eastern mysticism 

520
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:55,684
third it exists right now.
They know that in rats because of the 

521
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:03,190
cottonwood research foundation,
which is something that Dr Richard,

522
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,143
Rick Strassman,
who was the guy who wrote the book dmt 

523
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:07,940
the spirit molecule,
right?

524
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,853
He was the guy who got the first 
federally approved tests done on 

525
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:16,510
dimethyltryptamine clinic trials and uh,
it's an amazing book,

526
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:17,800
really,
really fascinating.

527
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,693
And he was a part of this cotton we'd 
Research Foundation and they've now 

528
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:26,980
proven that in live rats,
the pineal gland produces dmt.

529
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,050
Obviously that doesn't produce an in 
people,

530
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:30,430
but it's,
it's very hopeful to.

531
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:31,600
Do you have other mammals.

532
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,760
Yeah.
And again,

533
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:33,594
if,
if the molecular lock and key mechanism 

534
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:38,040
is set up in the brain already for this 
external drug to work,

535
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,200
there must be something like that 
already.

536
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,920
That's in the brain that evolved for 
some reason.

537
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,090
Are you aware of the correlation between
this and Moses

538
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,160
is burning Bush?
Oh,

539
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,780
I've heard ideas about that.
Yeah.

540
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:54,290
Jerusalem scholars believed now that the
burning Bush may very well have been the

541
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:57,170
occasional Bush.
Bush is a tree.

542
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:00,700
It's rich and dimethyltryptamine so that
this is.

543
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,550
Well,
it's sort.

544
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,290
He's tripping,
but I think we're getting.

545
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,250
We have to realize when we're 
translating things from the Bible,

546
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,380
when you're translating from ancient 
Hebrew,

547
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:14,381
which is incredibly unusual language,
where letters also double as numbers and

548
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:16,484
like the letter a is also the number one
and there's a numerical value to words 

549
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,374
and it's a very weird language to 
translate to Latin and Greek into 

550
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:26,804
English,
so when we're hearing that Moses 

551
00:24:28,581 --> 00:24:29,414
experienced a burning Bush and that this
burning Bush was God and God gave him 

552
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:35,210
these commandments on how to live your 
life.

553
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,823
It's entirely possible that Moses was 
tripping on dmt and that this burning 

554
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,083
Bush,
that what we're getting is an 

555
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:47,861
interpretation of somehow they had a dmt
experience from smoking this Bush,

556
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:49,880
right?

557
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,713
Smoking some aspects of it.
They figured out how to extract it or 

558
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:54,230
how to,
you know,

559
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,660
isolated and they had a 
dimethyltryptamine experience.

560
00:24:57,661 --> 00:24:59,390
I love that.
Which pretty much makes sense.

561
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,070
That totally makes sense.
I mean we get,

562
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,383
we get articles submitted all the time.
It skeptic magazine of people that 

563
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,510
attempt to make natural explanations for
biblical phenomena,

564
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,000
you know,
the Red Sea party because it was a giant

565
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:11,834
earthquake or you know,
the meteor strike cause the skies to 

566
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:16,250
turn red and that's what,
you know,

567
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,440
that the plagues of frogs,
you know,

568
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:19,700
that kind of thing.
Okay.

569
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:20,534
I like,
although we published one in which the 

570
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:25,610
argument was that Jesus was never,
he never died.

571
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:30,611
He was in a deep coma on the cross and 
that one of his followers had stabbed,

572
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,470
you know,
when he got stabbed in the side with the

573
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:37,020
wound that it actually had some chemical
that put them in this coma and then they

574
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,360
sort of a Dan Brown thing.

575
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,780
They whisked him off and put them in the
cave and then,

576
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,703
and then,
and then stole him and he ended up in 

577
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:44,830
France or India or something like that.
Okay.

578
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,570
Maybe you know,
I published it because I thought,

579
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:48,860
yeah,
there might be something to that.

580
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:50,750
And,
and I like those kinds of explanations.

581
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:51,584
On the other hand,
if you go into sorta your Joseph 

582
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,380
Campbell,
Jordan Peterson role of thinking,

583
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:58,214
well,
maybe these stories or doing something 

584
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:02,960
else entirely,
none of this stuff actually happened the

585
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:03,794
way it's described.
The stories are there to convey some 

586
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:10,460
moral homily or some message about how 
we should behave or act and that kind of

587
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:11,900
thing.
So I'm always conflicted about,

588
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,753
you know,
do I really want a natural explanation 

589
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:15,710
for this?
Do we need to go that path?

590
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,080
Or maybe the stories they didn't 
actually happened.

591
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,063
Moses has never really existed or the 
people never lived in the desert for 40 

592
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:25,940
years because there's no archeological 
evidence that this ever happened.

593
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,700
Maybe it didn't happen.
Maybe it's a story that represents,

594
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,871
you know,
destruction,

595
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:31,210
redemption,
starting over,

596
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,540
something like that.
Yeah,

597
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:33,410
more likely.
Right?

598
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,270
Um,
are you aware at all of,

599
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:36,104
uh,
any of the translations from the Dead 

600
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,550
Sea Scrolls?
I haven't followed that too.

601
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,530
There's a fascinating book to 
fascinating books that were written by a

602
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:43,980
guy named

603
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,900
John Marco Allegro and John Mark Allegra
was a scholar who was hired to be one of

604
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:49,734
the people to decipher the Dead Sea 
Scrolls and he deciphered them for over 

605
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:53,904
14 years and wrote a book called the 
sacred mushroom and the cross and his 

606
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,124
interpretation was that the entire 
Christian religion was a massive 

607
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:06,420
misunderstanding and what it really was 
that the original,

608
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,280
the original religion was based on was 
the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms

609
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,263
and fertility cults and all of these 
ancient parables were really just ways 

610
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:23,400
that they could retain the knowledge 
while hiding it from the Romans.

611
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,150
So they did it in the store stories and 
parables,

612
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:32,270
and he even traces back the word Christ 
to an ancient Sumeria word,

613
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,300
which means a mushroom covered in God's 
semen.

614
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,170
Yeah.
This is what.

615
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:38,550
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

616
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:39,384
Book has actually bought out by the 
Catholic Church and then reprinted 

617
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,660
recently by a guy named Irvin and he did
it like a five or six years ago,

618
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:50,340
maybe more.

619
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,020
He.
He reprints so you can buy it now,

620
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:52,854
but I have two copies of it that were 
original prints that I bought from a 

621
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:56,154
long time ago,
but they bought it out and send it out 

622
00:27:59,010 --> 00:27:59,811
to get rid of it.
Yes,

623
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:00,644
to get rid of it.
And then John Marco Allegro wrote a 

624
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:06,180
second book called the Dead Sea Scrolls 
and the Christian myth,

625
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,250
after they bought out his first book,
right?

626
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,084
So he has two books that are available 
that are basically supporting this 

627
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:11,904
theory,
but the idea was that rain would come 

628
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:18,831
down and the people at the time,
we have to consider the fact that infant

629
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:19,704
mortality was incredibly high back then.
People died all the time and fertility 

630
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:23,904
was very unknown.
No one really understood why people got 

631
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:29,160
pregnant or how they got pregnant or 
what kept people from getting pregnant.

632
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,353
And so people were constantly concerned 
with the possibility of them going 

633
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:37,290
extinct and they really were concerned 
with villages getting wiped out,

634
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:38,490
their family getting wiped out.

635
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,323
So they were very concerned with 
fertility and they thought that when it 

636
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,554
rained,
these mushrooms that came out of the 

637
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:46,230
ground,
they came out of nowhere.

638
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,910
Like you know how quick a mushroom 
grows.

639
00:28:47,911 --> 00:28:49,290
It's not like a plant.
Right?

640
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,930
So if there's a spore,
which by the way,

641
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,853
their spores everywhere,
there's my sealyham that's underneath 

642
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:56,274
the earth and everywhere you go,
there's the potential for the growth of 

643
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:00,054
these mushrooms.
So the rain comes down and then almost 

644
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:05,730
instantaneously these mushrooms blossom 
up out of the ground,

645
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,170
right?
You eat these mushrooms,

646
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:09,420
you have intense psychedelic 
experiences.

647
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,300
You gather them up,
you hide it from the Romans,

648
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:13,134
you hide it from everybody.
Don't want people to know that this is 

649
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:15,954
your portal to God.
And so they had all these stories that 

650
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,374
they hit.
Now I don't know if he's right and I'm 

651
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:25,320
not a religious scholar,
nor am I an expert in ancient languages,

652
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,730
but it's incredibly compelling.

653
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,720
It's really fascinating stuff.
Interesting.

654
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,530
Yeah.
He was a legit rock solid scholar,

655
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,221
right?
You know,

656
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:33,300
he was,
by the way,

657
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:34,134
he was also an ordained minister and the
only one that was on the Dead Sea 

658
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,473
Scrolls deciphering group that was 
agnostic because through his study of 

659
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,574
religion,
once he became an ordained minister and 

660
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:51,370
then became a scholar through a study of
religion,

661
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:52,151
he realized like,
oh,

662
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:54,400
these are all like ancient weird 
stories,

663
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,533
and they're all incredibly similar and 
as you go back and time you find the 

664
00:29:58,781 --> 00:29:59,614
similarities.
And coon Bron is where they found the 

665
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,120
Dead Sea Scrolls is the oldest version 
of the Bible.

666
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:07,330
The only one that's written in in,
I think it's the only one that's written

667
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:08,580
in Aramaic,
right?

668
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,513
They.
They actually had to do DNA tests 

669
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,153
because the,
the Qumran scrolls were written on 

670
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,920
animal skins,
so they had to do dna tests on the skins

671
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:18,340
left.

672
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,510
So the one they could match up the 
pieces to the right animal.

673
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,390
Yeah.
So they had a match up the pieces of the

674
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,970
scroll when they were trying to piece it
all together,

675
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:31,240
like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle took them 
forever to do.

676
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,403
Right.
I do remember a controversy from a few 

677
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,910
years ago of the the Dead Sea Scrolls 
Committee,

678
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:41,590
whoever controls them were not very 
forthcoming about what they were finding

679
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:44,800
and letting go and letting outsiders 
look at the originals.

680
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,673
Yeah,
there's some wacky stuff in there 

681
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:47,230
apparently.
Yeah.

682
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:48,130
And also,
you know,

683
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,083
intellectual groups like that,
they tend to circle the wagons were the 

684
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:51,904
elite special experts and you can't look
at these things and I think there's 

685
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:55,474
that,
but I think there's also like if you're 

686
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,840
gonna go by the way Christianity set up 
those stories are,

687
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,810
this is what everything is based on as 
many Moses,

688
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,703
Joseph,
all these different characters that 

689
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,070
those stories are completely different.

690
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,420
Apparently in the Dead Sea Scrolls and 
there's a lot of wacky stuff.

691
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:15,254
Yes.
Right.

692
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,370
Things coming from the sky,
like alien type stuff,

693
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:19,950
right.
Weird Shit and right.

694
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,430
People were probably tripping their 
balls off.

695
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,650
You're probably.
I mean that's what I think.

696
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:28,651
It's entirely possible that the Zico 
story about the thing in this guy,

697
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,230
and of course the ecologists think well 
that they were seeing a Ufo but other.

698
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:34,661
No,
no.

699
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:35,494
They were tripping and I was much more 
likely that we know for fact that 

700
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:39,544
psychedelic mushrooms existed back then.
It is the easiest thing in the world to 

701
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,580
see a mushroom pick it up and eat it.
Right.

702
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:45,414
So when people did it all the time,
they experimented with food all the 

703
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:48,424
time.
There were no books to look up to see 

704
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:52,540
which are the good ones to eat according
to completely make sense.

705
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,350
Completely makes sense.
Yeah.

706
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,390
And there's also in a lot of really 
ancient religious art,

707
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,420
there's tremendous mushroom iconic 
photographs of these paintings.

708
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,140
Uh,
there's a tremendous,

709
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,740
tremendous amount of mushroom imagery,
ancient Christian art.

710
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,720
In fact,
the actual halo,

711
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,843
the halo used to be different.
The Halo that we see now is like a hula 

712
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:16,870
hoop around guys heads,
right?

713
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,230
But the old Hailu used to look like the 
bottom of a mushroom cap.

714
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
Oh really?
Have you ever seen,

715
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,130
you know,
see if you can find those images.

716
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,113
I wrote an article a long time ago 
called Santa Claus wasn't mushroom 

717
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,070
because Sam,
the,

718
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,913
the Amany to miscarry a mushroom,
that this is all based on looks like 

719
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:35,224
Santa Claus.
It's a white and red mushroom and a lot 

720
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:40,070
of people and it has a microrisal 
relationship with

721
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,080
the coniferous tree,
so that's the.

722
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,970
That's the mushroom.
The ammunition was scary,

723
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:45,200
but if you scroll down,
Jamie,

724
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:47,960
there's an image of see like there's all
those elves.

725
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,900
Look at the old.
Look at the.

726
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,380
Scroll up to that.
Elves up those elves.

727
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,700
Yeah,
that was.

728
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,683
It was all Christmas.
Like ancient Christmas images were 

729
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:00,344
connected to that mushroom.
Now scroll down to those images of the 

730
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,300
halo.
A look at the old halo.

731
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,150
The Halo looks like the bottom of a 
mushroom cap.

732
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,043
It does kind of.
So the idea was those aren't like 

733
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,010
markings or letters or numbers.
It's hard to tell.

734
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,873
Just lines.
Yeah.

735
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,860
There's a bunch of those though.
There's a ton of those images of ancient

736
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,473
religious figures with that circle 
behind them with all those lines that 

737
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:26,480
look exactly like the underside of a 
mushroom county,

738
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,463
and the idea was that these enlightened 
people were under the influence of 

739
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:31,370
mushrooms.

740
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,490
That's why they had the halo on voice to
designate like,

741
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,680
oh,
this is the guy who was on mushrooms.

742
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,080
We've taught us all this stuff.
I like that.

743
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,093
I like that idea better than Ufo.
We know it's a real thing running and 

744
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
nobody can look.
If you think you're brave,

745
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,710
go eat five dried grams of psilocybin 
mushrooms.

746
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,100
Good luck.
You can't tell me they don't work.

747
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,610
They work on everybody.
They don't.

748
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,563
They don't work whether or not you 
believe or not believe they just work 

749
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,123
right?
So there's an easy way to see if you 

750
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:03,140
just took them and you go,
oh,

751
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,370
I see why these people thought this.
Right?

752
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,273
Well,
my favorite biblical scholar to read is 

753
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:09,650
Bart Erhman,
dino barter mill.

754
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,390
He Does A.
Well,

755
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:12,224
he started off as a,
as a Bible scholar because he was a 

756
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:16,400
believer.
He went to the Moody Bible College.

757
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:18,740
He was going to be a preacher and 
evangelical in the whole thing.

758
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,020
And then he went to,
I think it was Princeton theological and

759
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:23,270
he found out how the book was really 
written.

760
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,330
It's awakened.
It was,

761
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,540
you know,
it's an edited volume with lots and lots

762
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:29,000
of people coming in later and modifying 
this and,

763
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,153
and,
and debunking some previous Old 

764
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:36,080
Testament in a story or whatever.
And then he ended up being an atheist or

765
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,700
agnostic or something,
whatever he is,

766
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:38,534
he not believe.
So this is sort of the atheist favorite 

767
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,840
biblical scholar because he doesn't come
at it with a religious belief,

768
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:45,674
but he,
he's got a bunch of teaching company 

769
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:47,504
courses where he deconstruct how Jesus,
how Jesus became the Messiah or God or 

770
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:52,940
whatever.
And you know,

771
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:53,774
the Old Testament,
the new testament with these books mean 

772
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,690
and it's a bit like a,
you know,

773
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,800
again,
Jordan Peterson,

774
00:34:57,801 --> 00:34:58,634
you know,
I'm going to talk for two hours about 

775
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,810
genesis one one,
how can you talk for so long?

776
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,420
Just a single chapter in a book,
you know,

777
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:06,254
and well there's,
there's a lot of historical 

778
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:10,820
interpretation.
So I do know art historians will look at

779
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:13,490
those Halos or the thing in the sky that
the Ufo,

780
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,691
the UFO.
No,

781
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:15,524
no.
Actually at that time that artists were 

782
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,570
putting those things in the sky for this
other reason.

783
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,141
Like,
okay,

784
00:35:21,141 --> 00:35:21,974
I didn't know that,
so it's good to have some historical 

785
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,080
background to the text or the.
Again,

786
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:28,760
I don't read Hebrew,
Greek,

787
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:29,594
Aramaic or Latin,
and so I'm trusting the King James 

788
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,410
Bible,
which I really shouldn't,

789
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,273
so I rely on people like Bart who can 
read it in the oldest version we have 

790
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,100
and

791
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,350
know that word actually means this.
Oh,

792
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:42,600
okay.
I would be.

793
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,110
I mean if,
if you could get into a time machine and

794
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:50,880
go to any time in history and just see 
what it was like how people behaved.

795
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,753
Yeah.
I'd be real tempted to go to ancient 

796
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:53,844
Egypt,
but I'd also really be tempted to go to 

797
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,800
around the time of Christ.
I mean,

798
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:01,500
I don't necessarily even know if Christ 
was a real human,

799
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,770
but I would love to see what life was 
like back then.

800
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,030
Bart Bart thinks he probably did exist 
and obviously not the Messiah,

801
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,873
not the supernatural step,
but that somebody like that or by that 

802
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:13,170
name.
Yeshua was not that unusual name.

803
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,670
Probably did a lot of the stuff he did.
This is itinerant preacher and so on,

804
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,750
so I'm on board with that.
I'm not part of the group.

805
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:21,450
The atheists say he never even existed,
completely made up story.

806
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,050
I don't think so.
Uh,

807
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,063
and I actually,
in the heavens and earth I conclude 

808
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,933
probably erroneously are in the minority
position that when he said the kingdom 

809
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:35,680
is within or in more famous passage that
I'm there,

810
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,653
my disciples standing here now will not 
die before they see the son of man 

811
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:42,750
return and these kinds of things in the 
gospels.

812
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:47,160
I think his message was,
there is no place that you're going to,

813
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,650
when you,
after you died that heaven is here,

814
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,050
this is it.
We have to make the most of it.

815
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,303
And it's,
it's a message that you would give to 

816
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,270
people that are suppressed,
oppressed by the Romans.

817
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,390
So I call this the oppression redemption
myth.

818
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:00,890
You know,
that,

819
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:01,723
that it's a story of a,
of like the native American ghost dance 

820
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:05,910
in 1890.
You know,

821
00:37:05,911 --> 00:37:06,744
when they're like an oppressed people,
they're about to be wiped out in a 

822
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:10,260
messiah.

823
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,900
Comes and says,
you know,

824
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,290
it's all going to be great.
You know,

825
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,900
we're going to change everything.
The buffalo are coming back.

826
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,973
If you wear this sweater,
it'll be impervious to white man's 

827
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:23,400
bullets and it was a very Christ like a 
story.

828
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,310
Uh,
and,

829
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,770
and when you start looking at it,
you see,

830
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:26,080
oh,
this,

831
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,760
this story that comes up a lot in 
history among oppressed peoples as a way

832
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:30,594
of saying we got to circle the wagons 
and take care of our own against these 

833
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:36,350
oppressors and make a better life here.
Yeah.

834
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:37,184
It just makes sense that there'd be so 
many parallels and you think about 

835
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:43,140
history and how many people were in pr,
oppressed and how often these narratives

836
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:43,974
repeated themselves over and over again 
when people got into power and then 

837
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:49,230
invaded others.
And yeah,

838
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:50,490
it's brutal history.
I was just,

839
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:53,670
I'm just reading a Neil Ferguson's new 
book,

840
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,830
the tower and the square.

841
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,663
It's about that,
the tension throughout all of human 

842
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:02,250
history,
civilization between hierarchical,

843
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:03,084
top down power structures and horizontal
network power structures and that 

844
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:11,100
they're always intention,
but mostly throughout history.

845
00:38:11,101 --> 00:38:12,880
It's the top down power,
whoever's.

846
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,620
And so his is one chapter opens with 
that scene from the good,

847
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:17,640
the bad and the ugly.
When,

848
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:18,843
um,
when Eli Wallach and cleanness twitter 

849
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:24,540
facing off each other in the cemetery 
and uh,

850
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:27,360
and cleanness which shoots the other guy
that really the bad guy.

851
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,643
And then Eli Wallach tries to shoot his 
gun and it's empty and so cleanness 

852
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,953
would walk over to him and he says,
there are two kinds of men in this 

853
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,390
world.
Those who have loaded revolvers.

854
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,060
And those who dig your going to dig.

855
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,460
Ferguson uses this star to say basically
that's the history of civilization.

856
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,850
Somebody who's got the loaded gun and 
everyone else is going to dig.

857
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,840
It's amazing that we made it this far.
I mean we live in such.

858
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,620
I mean I know that there's troubles 
today and I know we have issues in our,

859
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,500
in our own society and forget about 
other parts of the world,

860
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:01,750
which there's horrific things happening 
right now,

861
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,010
but in comparison to just a few thousand
years ago,

862
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,560
you would not want to live back there.
It'd be fun to go to visit.

863
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:09,394
If you come back.
I would want to go into a giant 

864
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:12,034
bulletproof hamster bubble,
like one of those roller and just like 

865
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,080
maybe where they couldn't see you.
I just want to be there.

866
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,110
They can't see me.
Just.

867
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,123
I would love to observe and see what.
Because we have all these like I'm 

868
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:25,910
watching this show Vikings,
right?

869
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,940
And Oh man,
it pissed me off.

870
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,833
Episode two,
this guy puts his feet up on the table 

871
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:33,430
and he's got rubber bottom soles of his 
shoe.

872
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:34,264
My Cue motherfuckers.
He has a heel that's clearly made in a 

873
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:42,070
factory and there's like this textured 
plastic bottom to his shoe.

874
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,230
I'm like,
how did no one catch this?

875
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:45,064
You guys have this amazing wardrobe and 
all these ships and I'll take a picture 

876
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:51,250
of it now.
I'll put it up on my instagram later was

877
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,810
so dumb.
It made me angry,

878
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:57,160
but I'm watching this and I'm like,
how do we know this was how they talked?

879
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,500
How do we know this is what they did?
How do we.

880
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,483
This is some weird interpretation of 
some historical events really are to 

881
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:07,780
interpret and of course thoughts don't 
fossilize.

882
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,790
So I started early in the book about,
you know,

883
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,643
who were the first people to figure out 
we're going to die and become aware of 

884
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:16,440
our own mortality in a way that,
well,

885
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,330
maybe I can conceive of being somewhere 
else.

886
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,260
I don't actually die.
So we,

887
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,990
we know,
uh,

888
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,823
you know,
an elephant's grieve and mammals grieve 

889
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:26,800
and Cetaceans,
dolphins,

890
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:27,760
whales,
and so on.

891
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,040
And chimps,
they,

892
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:29,874
you know,
they feel these mothers are just 

893
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,060
depressed and suicidal when they're 
infants die.

894
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,790
But that's different from conceiving of 
like,

895
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:37,624
well,
I know I'm going to die because I see 

896
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:43,330
people around me that I could conceive 
of maybe some other place to go.

897
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,553
So I start off with something of a 
paradox that if I asked you to imagine 

898
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:48,484
yourself dead,
you can't do it because to imagine 

899
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:51,580
anything,
you have to be alive.

900
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,953
So it's not going to be like falling 
asleep and waking up the next morning 

901
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:56,314
because you have dreams or whatever.
It's going to be more like general 

902
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,740
anesthesia where it's,
you know,

903
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:00,520
10,
nine,

904
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,211
eight,
boom,

905
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,180
boom lights out and you.
But you just never wake up.

906
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,510
So.
And we,

907
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:09,970
we talk about things like,
well there's nothing after death but,

908
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,520
but even the word no thing implies 
there's a thing or you know,

909
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:15,250
you're going to this place,
this another,

910
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,960
there's nothing,
no thing or nowhere.

911
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,490
It implies that there is aware that 
you're not going to,

912
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,340
but there's not even aware that you're 
not going to.

913
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:25,630
And it's like,
you know,

914
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:27,790
with Lawrence Krauss and some of these 
cosmologists,

915
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:30,370
you know,
what was there before the big bang.

916
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:32,110
So when you say,
well imagine the universe,

917
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,310
stars,
planets or galaxies,

918
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,370
no light,
but there's not even any space or time.

919
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,830
And at some point you just don't have 
the words,

920
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,990
Stephen's say what it is we're trying to
talk about.

921
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,480
There's,
there's nothing before the big bang.

922
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:46,340
You can't even ask actually talk about 
it.

923
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,180
Well don't they think now though,
that it's in,

924
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,640
it's entirely possible that the big bang
is like a cycle.

925
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,543
Yeah.
Well I think it's something like that I 

926
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:59,951
think spans and contracts infinitely 
forever that that's a preferable.

927
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,570
Well again,
we have to come up with some way to talk

928
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:03,404
about it.
So we also have this weird biological 

929
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:06,643
idea based on our own limitations that 
there's a birth and a death of 

930
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:10,790
everything,
right?

931
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,653
So actually have a chapter devoted to 
Deepak Chopra and the eastern wisdom 

932
00:42:13,941 --> 00:42:18,920
traditions were kind of buddies now.
And yeah,

933
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:19,754
I went to his center down in Carlsbad 
and spend some time there and I think 

934
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:23,930
he's all right.
He's a good guy.

935
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:25,160
Yeah.
Now he's totally a good guy.

936
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,000
I mean,
he,

937
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,510
he's been.
And at times in the past,

938
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,220
either misleading or misled.
Yes.

939
00:42:33,221 --> 00:42:34,810
Sometimes that's right.
Um,

940
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:35,743
you know,
some of his recommendations for dietary 

941
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:37,994
things or whatever perhaps.
But I know for sure because I've gotten 

942
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:42,890
to know him pretty well,
that he totally believes this stuff.

943
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,300
He says,
uh,

944
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:47,830
it sounds like woo as I used to call it 
a,

945
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,733
but a lot of it,
if you interpret it from a kind of a 

946
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:51,350
Buddhist,
western,

947
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:54,960
Buddhist position know when he says,
uh,

948
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,833
you know,
consciousness is the ground of all 

949
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:59,690
being.
It's the ontological primitive.

950
00:42:59,691 --> 00:43:04,560
These things that sound nonsensical.
But if you think about it sort of a,

951
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,810
from a simple perspective,
the entire universe is in your brain and

952
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:12,230
when you cease to exist,
the university says to exist for you,

953
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,453
but you're in your brain.
I call it the week consciousness 

954
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:18,350
principle.
It's sort of true by definition.

955
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,480
Now he goes a little bit further and 
says,

956
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:21,314
you know,
that consciousness is everything and 

957
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:27,170
that we bring into existence material 
stuff by thinking about her observing it

958
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,004
or whatever.
And here's some quantum physics 

959
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:31,040
experiments that are really spooky.
And it's like,

960
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:31,750
okay,
time out.

961
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,070
You know,
quantum physics is weird and spooky.

962
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:36,800
Consciousness is weird and spooky.
That doesn't mean they're connected.

963
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,050
He thinks they are.
So it's a debatable point.

964
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:40,140
Okay.
Uh,

965
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,870
but still,
um,

966
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,913
the,
the experience of going in and so I did 

967
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:46,634
the meditation thing and all the 
massages and the teas and the food and 

968
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:50,870
all that stuff.
And it's,

969
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,790
it's this beach side resort in Carl's 
bed.

970
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,160
You can't help but feeling better.
Like,

971
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,270
yeah,
this stuff works.

972
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,730
Whereas Carlsbad,
it's down by Encinitas.

973
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:01,940
North of San Diego has a beautiful area.
Totally beautiful.

974
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:03,150
Yeah.
He's Kinda deep box.

975
00:44:03,151 --> 00:44:06,590
Not done yet,
he's got a good thing going and not just

976
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:07,161
the bucket,
you know,

977
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:10,610
there's other people like Sam Harris at 
Bob Wright has a new book out called why

978
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:13,430
Buddhism is true and okay,
so it works.

979
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,070
So we're back to does it work?
What do you mean by does it work?

980
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,670
Not just for me,
I had an experience and I felt better.

981
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,590
We've got to do better than that for 
science.

982
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:22,424
So what Deepak and a brighter talking 
about is that is that the Western 

983
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,060
version of Buddhism may actually work 
medically.

984
00:44:29,061 --> 00:44:31,720
It may lower stress hormones in your 
body,

985
00:44:31,721 --> 00:44:32,160
but a lower

986
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,993
blood pressure.
These kinds of things that are 

987
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:34,884
measurable because that's what we want 
to know from a western scientific 

988
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:38,730
perspective.
Not just do I feel better,

989
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:42,480
but 67 percent of the people who did 
this particular treatment,

990
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,420
they got better by these measurable 
criteria.

991
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:46,500
Okay.
That's.

992
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,190
That seems fair enough to me.
I'm open to that now.

993
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:55,050
This idea that there's nothing or no 
thing that we can't even.

994
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,913
We can't even wrap our head around 
nothing because we would think of a 

995
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:02,850
thing that there's no thing,
but there's never a thing.

996
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,773
Right,
right.

997
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,880
But how do we or why?
Why don't we just say we don't know.

998
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:10,523
Why don't we speculate on the 
possibility of consciousness being some 

999
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:20,301
sort of ethereal thing or something that
exists outside of the Bible?

1000
00:45:21,211 --> 00:45:22,650
We don't know.
We really don't.

1001
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:23,510
That's what I say.
I,

1002
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:24,344
I conclude and you know,
I don't know if there's an afterlife or 

1003
00:45:27,151 --> 00:45:29,100
not at very end of the book.

1004
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,933
We can come back to this later.
I just say it doesn't really matter 

1005
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:34,080
whether there's an afterlife or not 
because we don't live in the afterlife.

1006
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:34,943
We live in this one,
so this is the time you got to do 

1007
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:37,494
whatever you gotta do.
I call this elvis error a lob is lv 

1008
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:42,990
singer.
Woody Allen's character in Annie Hall.

1009
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,133
I remember the scene early in the movie 
where he has a flashback as a young boy 

1010
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,500
and his.
He's in the psychiatrist office with his

1011
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:50,940
mom and you know,
what's the problem?

1012
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:52,860
He won't do his homework.
You don't do your homework.

1013
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,570
Why don't you do your homework,
Alvin?

1014
00:45:54,571 --> 00:45:58,310
He says the universe is expanding and he
says the universe is expanding,

1015
00:45:58,311 --> 00:45:59,940
goes to the universe,
is everything there is,

1016
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:02,190
and if it's expanding one day it's all 
gonna blow apart,

1017
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,890
so nothing really matters.
I'm not going to do my homework,

1018
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,080
and his father yells at him,
what is the universe?

1019
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,820
Got To do this.
We live in Brooklyn.

1020
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,280
Brooklyn is not expanding,
so that's my sort of take home message.

1021
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,760
We don't live in the afterlife or before
the universe or after the.

1022
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,240
None of that matters.
I mean it's interesting to talk about,

1023
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,790
but we live in this life so this is what
really counts.

1024
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,770
They're fascinating things to 
contemplate,

1025
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,100
but ultimately you really,
for practicality sake,

1026
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,350
you really should be paying attention to
life.

1027
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,520
Totally.
I mean,

1028
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:34,310
this is what I tell deep buck all the 
time when he says he bought,

1029
00:46:34,311 --> 00:46:35,144
you know Michael,
this table is actually made of atoms 

1030
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:39,120
that are mostly empty space and the 
quantum physicists,

1031
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,580
but according to Sean Carroll,
that's not correct over there,

1032
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:42,391
right?
Yeah.

1033
00:46:42,391 --> 00:46:45,420
He explained that this idea of empty 
space.

1034
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:46,260
He's like,
no,

1035
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,094
that's just a poor way of describing it.
I would defer to him and let him 

1036
00:46:50,761 --> 00:46:51,594
describe it.

1037
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,650
He also described the superpositions 
particles,

1038
00:46:55,651 --> 00:46:56,484
subatomic particles being in super 
position where they're in a state of 

1039
00:46:58,651 --> 00:46:59,484
moving and not moving at the same time.
He explained that in a way that 

1040
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:05,250
completely fucked my head up too.
I'm like,

1041
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:07,410
well,
I thought I had figured out sort of.

1042
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:08,680
I thought,
I know.

1043
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,810
I didn't think I had to figure it out,
but I thought I had a definition that at

1044
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:14,550
least was like,
okay,

1045
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:16,590
well it's this even though I don't 
understand,

1046
00:47:16,591 --> 00:47:17,101
and he's like,
no,

1047
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:18,540
it's not even that.
Okay.

1048
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,453
So yeah,
so I refer to be pleased if you're 

1049
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:23,190
interested,
go to this Sean Carroll podcast,

1050
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:24,403
as I understand it anyway,
that it doesn't really matter because 

1051
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:28,170
the atoms are jiggling in a way that 
this is solid.

1052
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:29,980
You could tell it solid and this is the 
level

1053
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,140
we live at.
So many drops on your head.

1054
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:32,951
You're,
you're in trouble.

1055
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:33,581
That's right.
Yeah.

1056
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:35,710
So again,
we don't live in a quantum world.

1057
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:38,110
We live in a macro world where this kind
of stuff does matter.

1058
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:38,944
Okay.
So,

1059
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,140
um,
you know,

1060
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:40,993
to,
for Deepak the whole Western way of 

1061
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:45,320
thinking scientifically,
there's a beginning and an end time is a

1062
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:48,850
linear thing that we could measure and 
there's birth and death,

1063
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,130
all that is the wrong way to think about
it.

1064
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,800
That the Buddhist way is that it's just 
all consciousness.

1065
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:54,634
And when you die,
you returned to the conscious state you 

1066
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:57,610
were before you were in before you were 
born.

1067
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,893
So,
so the physical body is just an 

1068
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:03,100
instantiation of this conscious thing,
whatever this is.

1069
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:04,210
And,
and,

1070
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:04,760
okay,
I,

1071
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,593
you know,
I don't know,

1072
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,460
uh,
you know,

1073
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,920
I'd be surprised,
but I'll be pleasantly surprised.

1074
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,850
I'll tell you that if it turns out,
know close my eyes for the last time and

1075
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:13,631
I wake up and,
you know,

1076
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:14,740
there's deep pockets,
you know,

1077
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,860
whoever my friends,
Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould and all

1078
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,150
the greats,
Asimov are there.

1079
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:20,950
Everybody's there.
Hitches there,

1080
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:21,521
you know,
it's like,

1081
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:22,690
oh boy,
okay,

1082
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,010
this isn't,
this isn't hell.

1083
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,480
Uh,
if that's true,

1084
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:26,710
you know,
I'm not against any of this.

1085
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,573
Just like I'm not against Ray Kurzweil 
in these guys figuring out that we can 

1086
00:48:30,731 --> 00:48:32,830
live 200 years or 300 years.
Great.

1087
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,050
If you can do it,
you know,

1088
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:35,680
but let's just,
you know,

1089
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,330
so when they say to me,
Sherman,

1090
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,164
don't you want to live to be $500,
it's like just get me to 80 without 

1091
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,780
prostate cancer.
Give me the 90 without Alzheimer's,

1092
00:48:43,781 --> 00:48:45,700
you know,
100 to 100.

1093
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:47,840
So I'm not on a morphine drip in a bed,
you know,

1094
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,070
just quality of life incrementally year 
by year.

1095
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,550
And if it turns out you solve these 
problems and we lived $150,

1096
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,503
$200,
then we have a bunch of other problems 

1097
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:57,820
we don't even know about yet.
Okay.

1098
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,470
Well I think there's some beauty in 
temporary things that we,

1099
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:07,150
for whatever reason we're,
we're avoiding that concept.

1100
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,013
We were terrified of things ending and 
there's beauty and things being 

1101
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:12,710
temporary,
right?

1102
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,010
You don't want to go to see a movie 
that's 100 hours long.

1103
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,290
That's a movie's a great movement is 90 
minutes you're in your app,

1104
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:21,100
maybe two hours.
If it's three hours,

1105
00:49:21,101 --> 00:49:21,934
if it's blade runner or something,
something crazy like Christopher 

1106
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,380
hitchens in my book is I love his 
analogy.

1107
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:27,214
First of all,
you're at the party and death taps you 

1108
00:49:28,571 --> 00:49:29,404
on the shoulder says you have to leave 
and worse the party is going to go on 

1109
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,670
without you and they're going to all 
have fun.

1110
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:34,504
It's like,
oh no,

1111
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,170
but if the Christian version of of,
of Heaven and Hell is real,

1112
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,393
you're tap on their shoulder at the 
party until you can never leave the 

1113
00:49:41,441 --> 00:49:42,160
party.
It's like,

1114
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,450
oh,
that's even worse.

1115
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,610
I don't want to.
I don't want to do anything forever.

1116
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,773
Right,
and imagine the classical version of 

1117
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:50,163
what heaven is like a guy with a harp 
and there's a bunch of babies with 

1118
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:57,190
wings,
like what are even that aside,

1119
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,760
this way?
Hitch called it a celestial North Korea.

1120
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,653
You have a dictator that knows all of 
your thoughts and everything you're 

1121
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:05,240
going to do.
It's like,

1122
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,140
wait a minute that that does not sound 
like fun to me.

1123
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,540
That seems to me to be the inevitable 
future though.

1124
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:11,374
That's one of the things that I'm really
nervous about the dystopian version of 

1125
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,593
technological interference in our lives.
I'm an entirely convinced that we're 

1126
00:50:20,381 --> 00:50:23,320
going to,
in inside of 100 years,

1127
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,423
live in a world where all of your 
thoughts really are documented and 

1128
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:28,090
there's

1129
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,830
there's they have access to them the 
same way.

1130
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:35,790
No one in their wildest dreams conceived
to photographs for hundred years ago.

1131
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,993
In 400 years from now,
we're going to have the ability to 

1132
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:39,704
record record thoughts and ideas and 
they're going to be able to read the 

1133
00:50:42,111 --> 00:50:42,944
contents of each other's minds.
That could be well maybe that maybe we 

1134
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:47,894
need some regulation there for that 
maybe or maybe we just have to accept 

1135
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:51,494
the fact that most of what goes wrong in
the world goes wrong because people can 

1136
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,490
think the secret,
sneaky,

1137
00:50:58,491 --> 00:51:02,650
fucked up thoughts and when those no 
longer exist anymore,

1138
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,680
maybe it will clean out human behavior.
There was an at our limits episode about

1139
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:07,514
that in the 19 fifties.
It might've been the other one pilot 

1140
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,793
tell twilight zone where this guy all of
a sudden is able to read the minds of 

1141
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:20,030
other people and he's at work and he's 
listening to all these conversations and

1142
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:21,530
you know,
all this fun stuff.

1143
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:24,560
But then this one guy who's really dark,
like he's gonna,

1144
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:29,680
he's gonna come in and blow everybody 
away and sort of climax is where he,

1145
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:30,614
you know,
he comes in and tells the boss and 

1146
00:51:31,361 --> 00:51:32,620
everybody in it and they,
you know,

1147
00:51:32,621 --> 00:51:34,720
they go in there and it turns out the 
guy says,

1148
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:36,110
well,
I was never going to do that.

1149
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,970
I was just angry and I was just thinking
that,

1150
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:40,580
you know,
so that's like a minority report thing,

1151
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:42,080
you know,
you could have these thoughts.

1152
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:46,130
We know from research that this is David
buses research on.

1153
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,010
He wrote a book on murders,
the murder next door it's called.

1154
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,430
And so he did the research on asking 
subjects.

1155
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,520
Have you ever thought about killing 
somebody you didn't like?

1156
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,123
It turns out like 80 percent of guys and
67 percent of women have had homicidal 

1157
00:52:00,861 --> 00:52:01,880
fantasies in their life.

1158
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:06,260
Now 90 nine point nine percent of us 
never act on her homicidal fantasies,

1159
00:52:06,261 --> 00:52:07,094
but we get mad at us if we can imagine 
and he's got the narrative accounts 

1160
00:52:09,261 --> 00:52:12,560
because he also asked him,
tell me what you would do and Oh my God,

1161
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:13,394
they're just incredible to read.
Like I would break every bone in his 

1162
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:16,604
body and then I would pull out his 
fingernails and then I would just say 

1163
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:20,810
they go onto your.
You're like,

1164
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:24,080
Holy Shit,
but it's just fantasy.

1165
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,820
Fantasy.
Yeah.

1166
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,653
Some people have suicidal fantasies.
It's people that have fantasies of 

1167
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:30,630
jumping off of a giant building.
Right.

1168
00:52:30,631 --> 00:52:32,870
You what I mean,
but most don't act on it.

1169
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:33,704
Most don't act on it and there's people 
that just have these thoughts and they 

1170
00:52:36,471 --> 00:52:38,260
think I'm.
They look at the edge and they go,

1171
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:40,700
I could just jump off right now and and 
this whole thing,

1172
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:43,610
but I won't and shouldn't be punished 
them.

1173
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,810
No,
of course not.

1174
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,820
The minority report scenario,
it's like,

1175
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:47,654
okay,
we found out that this guy's thinking 

1176
00:52:48,771 --> 00:52:51,710
about robbing the bank,
so he had a fantasy about it.

1177
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:53,690
He's going to do it.
I've thought about doing that.

1178
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,610
You have,
not really,

1179
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,833
but just really fleet and I was like,
what would I do if I had to rob this 

1180
00:52:59,301 --> 00:52:59,781
bank?
I mean,

1181
00:52:59,781 --> 00:53:02,180
I've never actually considered robbing a
bank,

1182
00:53:02,181 --> 00:53:03,230
but I thought,
okay,

1183
00:53:03,231 --> 00:53:05,390
I'm at the bank.
What am I just decided to pull out a gun

1184
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:07,310
and everybody gets the floor.
Where's the,

1185
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,530
where's the cameras?
Where's the security guard?

1186
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,930
You know,
like you've seen so many movies.

1187
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:13,880
It's a if you're bored,
you know,

1188
00:53:13,881 --> 00:53:14,714
but today that's another thing.
People are rarely board because when 

1189
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:18,450
they are,
they just pull out their phones,

1190
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:22,920
stare at pictures of their butts.
It's like,

1191
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,100
you know,
you just pull out facebook or instagram.

1192
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,080
No longer board.

1193
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,170
When I was in my religious phase and in,
uh,

1194
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,100
in college I asked,
that was before I went to pepperdine,

1195
00:53:32,101 --> 00:53:33,780
which is a religious clothes at Glendale
College,

1196
00:53:33,781 --> 00:53:34,614
just to get my g out of the way.
And my philosophy professor was an 

1197
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:38,244
atheist and I was an evangelical.
So I'm telling them about Jesus and the 

1198
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:41,484
whole thing and the after life.
And he said he want to know are there 

1199
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:44,910
golf courses and tennis courts in 
heaven?

1200
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,880
Because I gotta have something to do,
I'd be bored.

1201
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,780
I thought I have no idea and need.
Yeah,

1202
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,340
I know,
but it'd be with cheese.

1203
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,800
I want to play golf.

1204
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,553
Then I also quote from Julia Sweeney is 
letting go of God monologue that she 

1205
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,950
opens this monologue,
you know,

1206
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:08,180
dealing with the Mormon boys coming by 
or her house in,

1207
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:10,650
in Hollywood,
and they're pitching their story like,

1208
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:12,150
okay,
come on in and pitch me your story.

1209
00:54:12,151 --> 00:54:14,040
Like it's a Hollywood movie script.
You know,

1210
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,053
what do you got?
So they tell her the whole time it's 

1211
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:17,251
going to be great.
You know,

1212
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:20,220
the blind shall see again that Jeff 
Shell here again,

1213
00:54:20,221 --> 00:54:22,890
and your body will be whole again.
And so she says,

1214
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:24,870
well,
let's see.

1215
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,550
Um,
I had uterine cancer.

1216
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:27,384
So I had my uterus taken out.
Do I get my uterus back when I go to 

1217
00:54:29,521 --> 00:54:30,091
heaven?
They said,

1218
00:54:30,091 --> 00:54:30,901
yeah.
She goes,

1219
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:35,610
I don't want it back.
What if you had a nose job and you liked

1220
00:54:35,611 --> 00:54:37,890
it?
They'll have to get my old nose back.

1221
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,833
It's true.

1222
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,813
I'd say openness.
A little funny story because it gets to 

1223
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:44,700
the problem of identity.
Who are you?

1224
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,013
So if you're resurrected with Jesus,
he early earlier Christian sex before 

1225
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:55,380
descartes introduced dualism.
They believe that you are,

1226
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:56,870
when you're resurrected at the,
you know,

1227
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:57,823
after your death,
you are physically there in heaven 

1228
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,500
physically and your soul.
The whole thing.

1229
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:03,900
It's just one thing.
So the question is,

1230
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:05,580
well,
how old are you when you're there?

1231
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,573
You know,
so you're brought up and there you are 

1232
00:55:07,141 --> 00:55:09,070
sitting next to Jesus and God and 
whatever,

1233
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,261
you know.
So they.

1234
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:11,094
Okay,
30,

1235
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,550
30 seems like a good year.
It's a year.

1236
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,840
Jesus was crucified.
Okay.

1237
00:55:15,841 --> 00:55:16,700
Thirty.
Like,

1238
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,573
but wait a minute and I'm 63 now.
So what happens is all the memories of 

1239
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:22,620
my life for the last 33 years.
Oh No,

1240
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:24,690
you get all those memories.
Okay?

1241
00:55:24,691 --> 00:55:25,524
But the memory,
the memory of my being 30 now is 

1242
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:31,980
different from the memory I had when I 
was 50 of being 30 and 40 being 30.

1243
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,500
And even when I was in my thirties being
30,

1244
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,281
you know,
the,

1245
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:37,410
the memories are always changing and 
edited in,

1246
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:38,244
in,
in,

1247
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,760
um,
and forgotten or modified if it,

1248
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:44,580
particularly based on life experiences 
that happened afterwards.

1249
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:46,290
So in your twenties,
you go to this college,

1250
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:49,080
he marry this person and you take this 
job or whatever,

1251
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,213
you don't really know what the Info,
the impact of those decisions are until 

1252
00:55:53,491 --> 00:55:54,324
much later in life,
which is why we think it's ridiculous 

1253
00:55:56,131 --> 00:55:56,964
for people to write memoirs in their 
twenties or thirties because they're 

1254
00:55:58,621 --> 00:55:59,454
celebrities.
You have no idea what those things 

1255
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:05,640
actually mean until much later.
So this is the problem of who you are.

1256
00:56:05,641 --> 00:56:07,260
So first of all,
we,

1257
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,650
we already know that none of your body 
is the same material.

1258
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:11,700
It was,
say a decade ago.

1259
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:15,150
Your cells are all recycled.
The molecules and atoms are gone.

1260
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,680
There's new ones that replace it.

1261
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,513
It's the pattern.
It's the pattern of information that 

1262
00:56:18,931 --> 00:56:20,370
represents you,
Joe Rogan.

1263
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:22,230
This is what you look like.
These are your memories.

1264
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:23,543
So somehow that this has to be copied.
So in the Ray Kurzweil scenario of the 

1265
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:29,560
singularity,
we're going to upload the mind.

1266
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:33,670
They're going to copy your connectome,
all your memories in your synapses.

1267
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,560
Okay?
So right away there's the problem of,

1268
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:37,240
well,
which memories will all of them?

1269
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,133
No,
there are no fixed set of memories that 

1270
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:41,740
are you.
Your memories are always changing.

1271
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:45,190
So the moment you take a snapshot of it,
that's just a fixed point.

1272
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:49,600
That's not you really.
You are this whole long continuum.

1273
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,913
Uh,
that's always kind of flexible and 

1274
00:56:51,821 --> 00:56:53,200
changing.
So there's that.

1275
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:54,903
And then there's the problem with the 
mind uploading scenario is there's two 

1276
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,193
kinds of cells.
There's the memory cells meme self of 

1277
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:03,040
all your memories,
and then there's the point of view,

1278
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:04,240
self pov self.

1279
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,700
So when you go to sleep tonight,
you wake up tomorrow,

1280
00:57:06,701 --> 00:57:09,040
you're still looking at the world 
through your eyes,

1281
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:12,160
and there's a continuity of point of 
view from one day to the next.

1282
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,060
Same thing with general anesthesia.
So like in the Johnny Depp movie,

1283
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:18,760
Transcendence,
where he is poisoned by these terrorists

1284
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:19,840
and he's dying,
he's got to,

1285
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:22,700
like a week ago,
he copies his mind connect.

1286
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,583
Um,
quilvent of the genome and puts it into 

1287
00:57:24,911 --> 00:57:25,744
a computer and then he dies and they 
turned the computer on and he's in the 

1288
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:29,260
computer looking out through the little 
camera hole.

1289
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:33,310
I don't see how this could happen.
That is if we copied you,

1290
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:34,480
your connectome,
everything,

1291
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:35,343
all your memories.
So we had a Joe Rogan number two copy 

1292
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:40,930
ready to go,
but instead of you dying,

1293
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:41,823
let's say we had a sophisticated.
If Mri brain scan machine slid you into 

1294
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,180
it,
copied your connectome,

1295
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,073
uploaded it into the cloud or whatever,
and then we slide you back out and 

1296
00:57:49,961 --> 00:57:50,920
you're standing there,
you,

1297
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,840
you're still looking at the world 
through your eyes.

1298
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,090
That's just Joe Rogan.
Number two,

1299
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,760
a copy and no more.
Do you look at that than a twin looks at

1300
00:57:58,761 --> 00:57:59,471
it.
Sibling and says,

1301
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:00,310
well,
there I am.

1302
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,000
No,
no,

1303
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,900
you're still standing.
They go,

1304
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:02,260
no,
no,

1305
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,480
I'm here.
That's just a copy of me.

1306
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:06,123
And so this to me seems a a central 
problem with the mindup loading 

1307
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:11,500
scenario.
It's just a copy.

1308
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,363
Did you see the thing in national 
geographic today about the clone 

1309
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,430
monkeys?
No,

1310
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,293
they've,
they've managed to actually clone 

1311
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:18,850
monkeys.
No.

1312
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,960
Yeah,
so Jamie,

1313
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:22,930
I uh,
I tweeted it earlier today.

1314
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,040
It's crazy and were speculating that if 
they can do that two monkeys,

1315
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:29,080
they're going to be able to be able to 
do that to humans.

1316
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,030
But again,
so who is right?

1317
00:58:31,031 --> 00:58:32,860
Who is that?
If there's a Michael Shermer.

1318
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:36,160
Is it your twin?
I mean like when you meet twins,

1319
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,690
they,
it's very weird.

1320
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,370
Like I used to date a girl who was a 
twin.

1321
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:41,950
She had a sister looked exactly like 
her,

1322
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,173
but like a little,
just a something just to feel like 

1323
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
you're not super,
super confusing.

1324
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,270
So they weren't the same person but they
pretty much were.

1325
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:55,870
Yeah.
Here's the,

1326
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,190
here's the article,
scroll up there,

1327
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,470
clone monkeys created in the lab.
Now what?

1328
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,513
Yeah.
Okay,

1329
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,520
well,
so you're making copies so it's a copy,

1330
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:04,354
but it's not the same person because 
they had their own individual life 

1331
00:59:06,131 --> 00:59:06,964
experiences.
The moment you and your copy start 

1332
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,490
diverging away and lead leading 
different lives,

1333
00:59:11,491 --> 00:59:13,910
you're gonna have different memories you
should have on your show.

1334
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,620
Nancy Siegel from cal state fullerton.
She's the world's leading twin expert.

1335
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:18,483
And she has all these great scenarios.
She a new book out called accidental 

1336
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:27,401
brothers and she has another book out on
switched at birth and Nancy Siegel and,

1337
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,380
and,
and these are scenarios that not only do

1338
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:31,214
we have the behavior genetics studies 
because she worked on the famous 

1339
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:34,934
Minnesota twins research,
not the baseball team at the twins 

1340
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:41,270
research of twins separated at birth and
raised in different environments.

1341
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:41,630
Like,
you know,

1342
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:44,690
the one raised in a Jewish home,
the other raised the Nazi Germany.

1343
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,790
They get together,
they have the same watch,

1344
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,400
they wear the same kind of clothes,
they use the same toothpaste.

1345
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:53,060
They married women that look pretty,
pretty similar,

1346
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,213
you know.
So there's a lot that genetics does 

1347
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,110
that.
It's very subtle.

1348
00:59:57,111 --> 01:00:00,530
There's no gene for like,
we're both Catholic or wearing this kind

1349
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:02,030
of close.
But you know,

1350
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:02,864
if you have.
Nancy explains that if you have a 

1351
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:07,160
certain body type,
which twins are going to have almost the

1352
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:09,890
exact same body type.
Certain clothes are going to look better

1353
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:11,720
on you and you're more likely to pick 
those.

1354
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:13,580
So by chance are more likely to get 
similarly.

1355
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,593
There's no genes for clothes,
but something like that body type or 

1356
01:00:16,941 --> 01:00:18,470
temperament,
you know,

1357
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,710
you have a certain kind of temperament,
at least half of which is,

1358
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,010
is heritable.

1359
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:26,840
So you're more likely to choose certain 
professions or prefer certain hobbies or

1360
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:29,750
activities or pick spouses that are kind
of,

1361
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:30,683
you know,
that would gel well with that 

1362
01:00:31,371 --> 01:00:33,490
temperament.
So this,

1363
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,540
if you make good decisions though,
well yeah,

1364
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:38,300
there is that.
There's an element of volition.

1365
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,760
The choices you make in life do diverge 
a little bit.

1366
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:43,370
So they're twins are a little bit 
different from that,

1367
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:44,810
but yeah.
Um,

1368
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:46,060
but so a clone,
you know,

1369
01:00:46,061 --> 01:00:46,894
again,
the moment you start leading separate 

1370
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:48,614
lives,
so why the copy of you is not going to 

1371
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:52,610
be you in heaven in religions have the 
same problem and you know,

1372
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,350
if God is able to reconstruct your body 
like,

1373
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:59,870
like a transporter.
I got into the world of Star Trek when I

1374
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:00,770
was writing this book.
It's like,

1375
01:01:00,771 --> 01:01:03,290
oh my God,
they have this whole webpages devoted to

1376
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:04,780
what does the transport do?

1377
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:05,661
It's like,
okay,

1378
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:06,231
first of all,
you know,

1379
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:07,160
there's no transport it,
right?

1380
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:09,590
This is just science fiction,
it could be whatever it wants,

1381
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:10,903
but is it copy and paste,
they just copy you and reconstruct you 

1382
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:15,980
on.
So with Adams on the other side or is it

1383
01:01:15,981 --> 01:01:16,814
cut and paste or is it the.
They actually moved the atoms and 

1384
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,593
reconstruct it anyway,
but it does get to the problem of 

1385
01:01:23,421 --> 01:01:24,171
identity.
Well,

1386
01:01:24,171 --> 01:01:26,720
what are you really because you don't 
have to.

1387
01:01:26,721 --> 01:01:31,190
It's not the matter the material.
It's really the pattern which is why the

1388
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:32,024
singularity people focus on the cloud 
and uploading the mind because the 

1389
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:35,563
information but the information is 
always changing and how does the point 

1390
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:41,510
of view go with it?
See what the cryonics.

1391
01:01:41,511 --> 01:01:42,344
I can at least imagine that if I'm 
frozen and woken up somehow a thousand 

1392
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:50,150
years from now that I'd wake up like 
like do after surgery or sleep.

1393
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,583
I can't see how that would happen.
If you flip on the switch and the 

1394
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:56,090
computer or in the cloud or whatever,
that I'd be there going,

1395
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:56,924
Oh,
here I am.

1396
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:59,990
Well,
isn't there also the problem that every.

1397
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:01,670
What is it,
seven to 10 years?

1398
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:05,900
Every cell in your body essentially 
replaced except your neurons.

1399
01:02:05,901 --> 01:02:07,520
There's that.
That's right.

1400
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,950
Yeah.
So are we just are neurons would.

1401
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:13,580
That's the idea that that's what the 
singularity or not your nose job.

1402
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:16,310
That's fake,
but fake lips.

1403
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,740
That's your neurons only.
But even there,

1404
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:19,574
see the transhumanists they imagined 
this transitional stage where you start 

1405
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:24,840
wearing contact lenses.
Say they can call up the Internet.

1406
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:27,780
And the moment I see you Joe Rogan,
the name pops up,

1407
01:02:27,781 --> 01:02:28,614
your wikipedia page pops up.
And I know now I have this information 

1408
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:32,670
so I'm not bionic.
But uh,

1409
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,000
but I'm also not just human transhuman.

1410
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,110
Okay.
So then,

1411
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,980
then who are you?
Right?

1412
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:40,060
So these are the sort of the 
transitional stage.

1413
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:43,920
So a cochlear implant.
Is it kind of a brain chip and you know,

1414
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:44,754
probably,
I think you know about that research of 

1415
01:02:45,681 --> 01:02:46,514
the paraplegic quadriplegic man who can 
control his computer a cursor and now 

1416
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:53,913
they can actually control a fake 
artificial limb just by thinking about 

1417
01:02:57,331 --> 01:02:58,164
it.
So they put a chip in his motor cortex 

1418
01:02:59,041 --> 01:02:59,874
that reads the thoughts.
So he has these thoughts and he's been 

1419
01:03:01,531 --> 01:03:02,364
trained to pull the cup of water up to 
his mouth and drink with the artificial 

1420
01:03:06,211 --> 01:03:08,170
arm at some point,
you know,

1421
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,540
say 50 years,
a hundred years from now,

1422
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:10,374
we should,
we could have it all mapped and you can 

1423
01:03:11,701 --> 01:03:13,710
control your whole environment just by 
thinking,

1424
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,200
you know,
I would like to hear Mozart and you just

1425
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:19,230
think about it and then the music in 
your house comes on and it's Mozart.

1426
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:19,761
Well,
I,

1427
01:03:19,761 --> 01:03:22,040
I freak out about Siri sometimes,
like,

1428
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:22,923
um,
my daughter asked me about a song that 

1429
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:25,304
she likes and we were in the car and I 
pressed the Siri Button on my phone and 

1430
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:30,760
I said,
hey,

1431
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,370
it's some,
what's that new musical with the,

1432
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,580
what's his name?
Hugh Jackman Wolverine Guy.

1433
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,073
Some some musical that's based on 
ringling brothers and Barnum and Bailey 

1434
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:45,080
circus.
She wanted the song.

1435
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,273
I,
I,

1436
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:50,180
I literally asked Siri to do it.
And it started playing it instantly,

1437
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,063
like within a couple of seconds.
Like this is crazy that this thing just 

1438
01:03:54,981 --> 01:03:58,610
pulled it out of the sky and it's 
playing it in my car.

1439
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,410
Yep.
I did that the other night.

1440
01:04:00,411 --> 01:04:02,420
I wanted to hear Bob segers Hollywood 
nights.

1441
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:05,390
I'm not sure why I got that in my head 
and it popped right up.

1442
01:04:05,391 --> 01:04:07,520
There's a youtube video of him from 
1978.

1443
01:04:07,521 --> 01:04:08,780
Just rocking it.
It's like,

1444
01:04:08,781 --> 01:04:09,614
wow.
It's amazing that I'm just driving on 

1445
01:04:10,961 --> 01:04:12,970
the freeway.
Heading back home to Santa Barbara.

1446
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,260
I'd like to hear Bob Seger.

1447
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:16,710
Hollywood nights.
Wow.

1448
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:19,910
There it is.
The greatest showman.

1449
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,130
That's okay.
My daughter loves that movie,

1450
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:23,263
so she wanted to hear the song,
but I just talked to the phone and it 

1451
01:04:26,271 --> 01:04:28,580
did that.
When are we going to get past that?

1452
01:04:28,581 --> 01:04:30,240
Talking to the phone instead of 
thinking.

1453
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:31,203
Yeah,
because I'm pretty comfortable with 

1454
01:04:32,991 --> 01:04:34,190
looking for it.
Let me.

1455
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:34,941
Hold on,
honey,

1456
01:04:34,941 --> 01:04:37,160
let me find it online.
I'm going to go get it.

1457
01:04:37,161 --> 01:04:38,300
Okay.
Let me download it.

1458
01:04:38,301 --> 01:04:40,670
Let me pay for it.
Let me use my thumbprint or whatever,

1459
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:44,210
and then now it's just talk to your 
phone right when.

1460
01:04:44,211 --> 01:04:45,600
When is it?
Just pull it up.

1461
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,080
I want to hear led Zeppelin.
Whole Lotta love.

1462
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:48,943
I'll just.
I'll just start thinking that starts 

1463
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:54,740
playing and when is that going to 
happen?

1464
01:04:54,741 --> 01:04:55,950
That's probably coming.
We're,

1465
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,270
we're probably all going to give in to 
some sort of a chip.

1466
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:02,690
Something that we can get implanted.
Simple,

1467
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:05,660
easy trans dermal device,
you know,

1468
01:05:05,661 --> 01:05:07,400
fashionable.
You'd go to a club,

1469
01:05:07,401 --> 01:05:11,210
it glows who you got the new one,
iphone 38.

1470
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,633
Yeah.
I think all that's far more likely to 

1471
01:05:13,611 --> 01:05:14,444
happen before we get to the point where 
you could copy and entire brain in and 

1472
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:18,130
put

1473
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:22,200
it in a clone of your body.
I interviewed Kurzweil and uh,

1474
01:05:22,201 --> 01:05:23,034
I had a really interesting conversation 
with him for the Scifi show that was 

1475
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:30,590
doing a few years back and uh,
I find him to be very interesting.

1476
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:34,420
He's a fascinating,
incredibly intelligent guy that has,

1477
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:35,643
I think he has more than a hundred 
different patents and things things 

1478
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:39,970
invented.
He's a genius.

1479
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
He's a bonafide genius,
but I also found it incredibly,

1480
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:49,870
a sad his motivation,
like what he's trying to do,

1481
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:51,490
you know,
he's trying to recreate his father.

1482
01:05:51,491 --> 01:05:52,120
Yeah,
yeah.

1483
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,190
Yeah.
Because they didn't see that,

1484
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:54,260
uh,
the documentary better.

1485
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:55,123
Yes.
Yeah.

1486
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:56,770
Transcended,
it was kind of sad.

1487
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:57,813
It's dark,
it's very dark and he's got all his 

1488
01:06:00,011 --> 01:06:03,160
basement is filled with all his dad's 
stuff and um,

1489
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,740
you know,
he always talking about life,

1490
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:06,461
life,
life,

1491
01:06:06,461 --> 01:06:08,650
but he just really kind of obsessed with
death.

1492
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,540
This is what I worry about is that 
again,

1493
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:12,040
back to the Elvis era,
you know,

1494
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:13,600
we don't live in,
in the next life,

1495
01:06:13,601 --> 01:06:14,434
whatever that is or the far future we 
live now and don't miss it if you're so 

1496
01:06:18,281 --> 01:06:21,760
focused on death and,
and how we can solve these problems.

1497
01:06:21,761 --> 01:06:23,320
Okay.
I'm glad somebody working on it and he's

1498
01:06:23,321 --> 01:06:25,660
head of engineering for all of Google 
now and they had that company,

1499
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,523
Calico,
so a couple of hundred million dollars 

1500
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:29,890
working on aging problems.
Great.

1501
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,690
Again,
if you could solve Alzheimer's,

1502
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:32,770
those things,
that's great,

1503
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:36,130
but you know,
don't be so focused on the next life you

1504
01:06:36,131 --> 01:06:37,300
miss out.
Well,

1505
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:40,960
I don't necessarily know if he is so 
focused that he's missing out.

1506
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:41,794
I don't think he's missing out on.
I think he has extraordinary vision in 

1507
01:06:46,061 --> 01:06:49,870
terms of like what is possible with the 
exponential increase of technology.

1508
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:52,270
So I think having a guy like that 
around,

1509
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,490
it's helpful.

1510
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:56,740
It's.
I think it's beneficial to everybody.

1511
01:06:56,741 --> 01:06:59,640
It's incredibly fascinating to hear him 
talk about those things.

1512
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:02,440
You know?
I'm too dumb to know if he's right.

1513
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,320
What I'm hearing him talk,
I'm like,

1514
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:05,500
you think really?
Thank you.

1515
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:06,161
Yes.
By 20,

1516
01:07:06,161 --> 01:07:08,770
45 will be downloading our brain into a 
computer.

1517
01:07:08,771 --> 01:07:09,940
Mind man,
I don't know.

1518
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:12,180
That shit seems close.
Yeah,

1519
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,700
it's 2018 man.
I mean when I interviewed him,

1520
01:07:15,701 --> 01:07:18,490
I think it was probably 2013 or 
somewhere around then.

1521
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,620
Although to be fair,
if you said,

1522
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,790
you know,
a century ago when they had telegraphed,

1523
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:24,970
well more than a century ago,
the invention of the Telegraph,

1524
01:07:24,971 --> 01:07:25,804
but you know,
in a century and a half or so you're 

1525
01:07:27,191 --> 01:07:28,024
going to be pressing a button and just 
calling out what you want on a little 

1526
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:32,740
box.
It'd be like urine saying this,

1527
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,400
what are you talking about?
Smoking?

1528
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:36,970
And here we are,
you know,

1529
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:42,070
so this way science fiction is usually 
set far enough in advance like a century

1530
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:45,880
or two rather than in the historical 
present.

1531
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:48,580
So that you can populate these kinds of 
things.

1532
01:07:48,581 --> 01:07:50,380
This is what science fiction writers 
tell me.

1533
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:51,860
If you set it up far enough,
uh,

1534
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:54,550
uh,
readers are willing to suspend disbelief

1535
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:55,031
because.
Yeah,

1536
01:07:55,031 --> 01:07:56,980
it seems possible.
Look what we've been able to do.

1537
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:57,911
So.
Okay,

1538
01:07:57,911 --> 01:07:59,410
fair enough.
If we can do that,

1539
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:01,480
um,
I'm all for it.

1540
01:08:01,481 --> 01:08:02,800
That'd be great.
Yeah.

1541
01:08:02,801 --> 01:08:04,630
I'm all for it too.
But boy,

1542
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:05,620
I don't know.
I'm,

1543
01:08:05,621 --> 01:08:06,454
I'm,
I've been very convinced and more so 

1544
01:08:09,401 --> 01:08:14,401
over time that human beings in this form
that our time is limited.

1545
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,040
I think.
Yes,

1546
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,873
when artificial.
And I think even the word artificial 

1547
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:23,450
life is a weird word to throw around 
because it's not going to be artificial.

1548
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,020
It's going to be an actual thing,
right?

1549
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,610
It's just going to be non biological.
Right.

1550
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:29,613
And I think it's,
I think that's what life is outside of 

1551
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:32,990
earth.

1552
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:36,770
I think that humans,
what we do with our curiosity,

1553
01:08:36,771 --> 01:08:39,590
if there's other curiosity in,
in the universe,

1554
01:08:39,591 --> 01:08:42,350
other curious life forms,
I think they probably do the same thing.

1555
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:43,040
They realized,
well,

1556
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:43,873
there's a massive limitation in terms of
biological tissue and in terms of our 

1557
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:51,320
ability to evolve like,
well,

1558
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:52,154
I could just reprogram a phone.
Your phone involves way quicker than 

1559
01:08:54,951 --> 01:08:57,080
people.
They go back to the goodyear.

1560
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:02,030
I have an iphone x right now.
Go back and think about an iphone one.

1561
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,140
That's a piece of shit that you have to 
go back to a decade,

1562
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,690
a decade.
Then it go back to that clinic.

1563
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:11,023
Seti scientists or scientists tend to be
skeptical of the UFO alien abduction 

1564
01:09:14,451 --> 01:09:17,180
stories because if we do encounter 
aliens coming here,

1565
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:19,000
they're not going to be biological.
Yeah,

1566
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:19,873
they're going to be computers or 
machines because that's the only thing 

1567
01:09:22,341 --> 01:09:24,710
they can survive the long distances.

1568
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,650
Long time of interstellar space flight.
Yeah.

1569
01:09:27,651 --> 01:09:28,484
I think we're just so wrapped up in the 
idea of biology being so important that 

1570
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:36,890
you have to.
It has to breed the normal way with eggs

1571
01:09:36,891 --> 01:09:38,930
and sperm or otherwise.
It's bullshit.

1572
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:41,080
I mean we think of it,
you know,

1573
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,190
but biology is,
you know,

1574
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:44,770
wet stuff,
but really their machines,

1575
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:48,140
a cell is a machine.
It's just processing molecules,

1576
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:51,570
which is what nanobots are going to do.
They're going to process molecule.

1577
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,390
So it's really just.
They're all machines.

1578
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:55,680
Yeah.
There's cellular machines and,

1579
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,563
and you know when they talk about things
like quantum computing and things get 

1580
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:01,490
really squirrely,
like,

1581
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:01,951
Whoa,
Whoa,

1582
01:10:01,951 --> 01:10:02,930
wait a minute,
what are you saying?

1583
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,820
Well,
what do you mean by quantum computing?

1584
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:06,020
Right?
Like where is this?

1585
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:07,003
Is this a computer?
Like does this use like a regular 

1586
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:11,780
motherboard?
Like how does it have a CPU?

1587
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:12,761
Like uh,
what,

1588
01:10:12,761 --> 01:10:14,870
what's,
what's next stage after that?

1589
01:10:14,871 --> 01:10:17,810
Like what do you know?
What,

1590
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:22,460
what resemblance is it going to have to.
Anything that we think of today in terms

1591
01:10:22,461 --> 01:10:25,040
of technology that we're accustomed to.
Right.

1592
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:27,380
You know,
so it really makes the point that,

1593
01:10:27,381 --> 01:10:28,570
you know,
if he try track,

1594
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:29,443
say back to the 19 fifties where you 
have computers the size of this room 

1595
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,340
down to now.
Okay.

1596
01:10:34,341 --> 01:10:38,120
So you just keep the curve going and 
eventually there'll be the size of blood

1597
01:10:38,121 --> 01:10:38,954
cells and you just ingest these little 
computers and then go in there and they 

1598
01:10:41,511 --> 01:10:46,180
fix your mutant dna in the bacteria that
are in there.

1599
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:48,170
They repair blood vessels,
that sort of thing.

1600
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:52,190
This is what he's envisioning and I can 
conceive of it in principle,

1601
01:10:52,191 --> 01:10:53,210
I think,
but they're,

1602
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:57,920
I forget whose law is in any,
any trend that cannot go on forever,

1603
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:58,754
won't.

1604
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:01,500
So.
Right.

1605
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,810
So if it gets to a certain,
like the,

1606
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:04,813
like Moore's law,
the doubling of that can't go on 

1607
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:09,020
forever.
Now the quantum computing people say,

1608
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:09,980
Oh yes,
that's right.

1609
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:10,814
It'll stop,
but we're going to do this other thing 

1610
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,220
that is completely okay.
Okay,

1611
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:17,340
fine.
Well boy,

1612
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,113
I just,
I mean there's so many things to 

1613
01:11:21,601 --> 01:11:24,570
speculate about in terms of our 
potential future,

1614
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,000
you know,
and the,

1615
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:26,913
the,
the,

1616
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:31,350
the fear of death is a very odd one.
It's normal,

1617
01:11:31,351 --> 01:11:32,850
it's natural,
it's biological.

1618
01:11:32,851 --> 01:11:34,830
Animals have it.
Every human has it.

1619
01:11:34,831 --> 01:11:37,200
Everyone's scared to die.
No one's scared to go to sleep,

1620
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:38,363
but everyone's scared to die.
And it's this idea that this would be 

1621
01:11:41,461 --> 01:11:43,440
the end of the party,
right?

1622
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,620
But really there's nothing to fear 
because you won't even know it.

1623
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,310
Right?
He is.

1624
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:52,290
As long as you're alive,
you're Santi and conscious of existence.

1625
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:54,510
And then not.
So.

1626
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:55,443
I mean,
when you ask people to quote surveys in 

1627
01:11:56,581 --> 01:11:57,031
the book,
you know,

1628
01:11:57,031 --> 01:11:57,864
how long would you like to live it?
It's always about what the average 

1629
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:02,131
lifespan is.
Now.

1630
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:02,881
People go,
Oh yeah,

1631
01:12:02,881 --> 01:12:05,150
I think I'd like to live in [inaudible] 
82 or so.

1632
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,950
But if we fast forward you to 80.
Okay,

1633
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:09,600
your time's up.
Tomorrow's your day.

1634
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,910
No way to get.
Give me another week.

1635
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:15,420
Okay,
here's everybody I need another month.

1636
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:17,170
A year to run my first marathon.
Yeah,

1637
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,213
exactly.
Yeah.

1638
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:21,150
I contend that it's a silly argument 
that you know,

1639
01:12:21,151 --> 01:12:22,320
that people say,
well,

1640
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:27,210
I think we should have a limit on our,
our lifespan and that we need to die,

1641
01:12:27,211 --> 01:12:27,721
you know,
but,

1642
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:29,190
but,
but you personally,

1643
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,050
are you going to check out when it's 
your time?

1644
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:32,670
No,
of course they would.

1645
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,300
As long as we're talking about being 
healthy and in,

1646
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:37,290
in,
in cognitively aware,

1647
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:39,410
then most people want to continue.

1648
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:41,460
Let me severely depressed suicide.
Yes,

1649
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:42,294
that's an issue,
but most people would want to continue 

1650
01:12:44,071 --> 01:12:44,904
on.
So that's a point in favor of the 

1651
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,083
transhumanists that yeah,
people will want to keep going on as 

1652
01:12:49,591 --> 01:12:52,950
long as they're healthy and happy and 
leading fulfilled lives.

1653
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:56,270
Yeah.
As long as everything's healthy.

1654
01:12:56,310 --> 01:13:01,310
My grandmother had a stroke and they 
gave her 72 hours.

1655
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,690
She wound up living 12 years.
Oh Wow.

1656
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:05,400
And it was,
it was awful.

1657
01:13:05,401 --> 01:13:06,690
She had,
she had an aneurysm.

1658
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:08,670
Oh,
the 12 years was awful.

1659
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,710
It was awful.
It was horrific.

1660
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:12,240
Yeah,
it was really bad.

1661
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:15,480
She was bedridden.
She would moan.

1662
01:13:15,481 --> 01:13:18,180
She was always in pain.
When she died,

1663
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:20,430
it was a relief for everyone in the 
family.

1664
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,410
It wasn't like,
oh,

1665
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:23,244
we lost.
Grandma was like grandma's mps now 

1666
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,160
because for the longest time she was in 
agony.

1667
01:13:29,161 --> 01:13:32,610
It was.
I stayed with them when I first moved to

1668
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:33,913
New York.

1669
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:37,590
They lived in New Jersey and I live with
them for a few months while I was saving

1670
01:13:37,591 --> 01:13:41,070
up money for an apartment and um,
it was a horrific man.

1671
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:44,880
She would be moaning and grandfather had
to take care of her and they had a nurse

1672
01:13:44,881 --> 01:13:46,560
would come over and take care of her as 
well.

1673
01:13:46,561 --> 01:13:47,394
It was just a,
I think Europeans have a more advanced 

1674
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:51,803
humanist type perspective on that 
euthanasia or physician assisted 

1675
01:13:55,021 --> 01:13:55,711
suicide.
Well,

1676
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,544
they're doing that now and a few states,
but there's still this kind of sort of 

1677
01:14:00,121 --> 01:14:04,350
Christian ethic of only God can decide 
that you can't make those decisions.

1678
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:05,573
And these are people more like Christian
conservatives who otherwise think the 

1679
01:14:08,401 --> 01:14:11,980
government should stay out of your life 
and you make your own and you

1680
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,740
take personal responsibility except when
it comes to your death.

1681
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,131
Like,
well,

1682
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:16,990
wait a minute,
why can't I choose that?

1683
01:14:16,991 --> 01:14:18,490
While they worry about abuse?
Okay,

1684
01:14:18,491 --> 01:14:19,840
fine.
Just have rules about,

1685
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,003
you know,
you have to sign something and we have 

1686
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:23,920
to.
Video Kevorkian used to video tape,

1687
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,130
you know,
his patients saying,

1688
01:14:26,131 --> 01:14:26,964
I,
I choose to do this when they could 

1689
01:14:27,971 --> 01:14:30,640
still do it anyway.
So yeah,

1690
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:31,563
I mean,
um,

1691
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:34,570
how we deal with death.
It's always been a huge problem.

1692
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:36,850
It makes people uncomfortable.
Um,

1693
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:37,930
and uh,
you know,

1694
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:38,764
how we talk about it matters and I mean,
one of the motives for me writing this 

1695
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:43,480
book is like I've written about science 
and pseudoscience.

1696
01:14:43,481 --> 01:14:45,700
Science and religion.
Science and guts signed some morality,

1697
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:46,480
but,
you know,

1698
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,060
really this is the big question.
You know,

1699
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:52,300
what happens when you die and this 
something that you know,

1700
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:53,163
that people think about a lot or they 
thought about a lot for a long time and 

1701
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:57,840
uh,
you know,

1702
01:14:57,850 --> 01:14:59,410
so,
and nobody knows.

1703
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,460
I contend,
you know,

1704
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,450
nobody knows for sure.
And uh,

1705
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:03,303
so we write these stories that kind of 
make us feel better because the whole 

1706
01:15:06,071 --> 01:15:06,904
theory called terror management theory 
that is premised on the idea that fear 

1707
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:11,434
of death is what drives civilization and
creativity and productivity and 

1708
01:15:14,621 --> 01:15:19,330
architects and artists and scientists 
are driven by this fear of death.

1709
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,900
But if you ask people,
do you walk around in a state of fear of

1710
01:15:22,901 --> 01:15:23,470
death?
Most?

1711
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:24,780
No,
I don't to it.

1712
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,140
Okay.
It's unconscious.

1713
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,191
Okay.
Maybe.

1714
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:30,430
But how do you know if it's unconscious?
So we have to hit these experiments with

1715
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:32,560
a prime.
The brain sort of try to trick it out of

1716
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:35,320
you and almost aren't they?
Most people are busy.

1717
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,333
They're busy.
Yeah.

1718
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,890
The fear of death comes when you're 
living alone at night.

1719
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:39,783
Right?
What is it going to be a day when I 

1720
01:15:40,871 --> 01:15:41,560
don't wake up?

1721
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,390
Right.
It's gonna.

1722
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:44,170
Maybe he'll die tonight while I'm 
sleeping,

1723
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,030
but you'd never know.
You just,

1724
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:47,850
you just,
it's just lights out and that's,

1725
01:15:47,851 --> 01:15:50,860
that's the greatest way to die.
Ever go to sleep and don't wake up.

1726
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:52,040
That's right.
Yup.

1727
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,040
Guy In your bed peacefully.
Yup.

1728
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,630
Yup.
That's a good way to go.

1729
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:56,680
Which is why,
you know,

1730
01:15:56,681 --> 01:15:58,250
hospice is probably,
you know,

1731
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:03,070
a really good thing that we're getting 
better at it in the west of just helping

1732
01:16:03,071 --> 01:16:03,904
people make that transition,
which is why back to near death 

1733
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:08,140
experiences.
It could be those brain chemistry,

1734
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,200
the brain chemicals.
That's what they evolved for was to help

1735
01:16:11,201 --> 01:16:13,690
that process.
As your brain is shutting down,

1736
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:14,823
you feel this sort of glow or this sort 
of good feeling that you know there's a 

1737
01:16:17,891 --> 01:16:18,724
tunnel you're going to pass through the 
sense of transitioning to some other 

1738
01:16:20,711 --> 01:16:21,544
place,
and this starts off very early in life 

1739
01:16:23,501 --> 01:16:23,660
I.

1740
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:27,790
I cite research by Paul Bloom and his 
lab at Yale with little kids,

1741
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:28,624
so he presents them with this little 
puppet show and so you have this little 

1742
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:32,044
mouse and this alligator and the 
alligator munches the mouse and he's 

1743
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:35,740
dead.
Where's the mouse now?

1744
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:36,870
Oh,
the mouse at this.

1745
01:16:36,871 --> 01:16:37,704
Other than this other place and he 
misses his mom and he's hungry and he's 

1746
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:43,330
scared.
So and this is like preschoolers.

1747
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,890
So it starts pretty young that this 
dualistic idea that something transcends

1748
01:16:47,891 --> 01:16:48,724
the physical body.
There's something else that continues 

1749
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:51,723
and I contend that that's because you 
can't conceive of nothing that just 

1750
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:56,183
don't perceive my own brain operating.
So it feels like thoughts are floating 

1751
01:16:58,931 --> 01:17:03,340
around up there and I feel like a kind 
of a set of patterns that would continue

1752
01:17:03,341 --> 01:17:08,341
beyond the physical body feels that way.
So our intuitions I think naturally lead

1753
01:17:08,411 --> 01:17:10,220
to the idea of some kind of afterlife

1754
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,053
or something continues.
It is possible or is it possible that 

1755
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,173
all these different cultures and all 
these different people have these 

1756
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:22,700
concepts because maybe something does 
happen.

1757
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:24,670
Maybe some that's right.
Yeah.

1758
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:25,523
It could be something that could 
possibly happen to whatever we think of 

1759
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:29,744
as consciousness.
That's sort of what we think of as you 

1760
01:17:31,671 --> 01:17:32,504
and I think most of our consciousness is
weighed down by life experiences and 

1761
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:37,064
genetics and our environment and all the
things that we carry around in our head 

1762
01:17:42,711 --> 01:17:45,390
is memories.
And I mean this is a big part of what,

1763
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,360
what your life is,
you know,

1764
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:52,370
and at the core of all that is the self 
is you are consciousness,

1765
01:17:53,421 --> 01:17:54,760
whatever that means,
right?

1766
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:55,603
It's never been.
No one's ever been able to take 

1767
01:17:56,871 --> 01:17:57,704
consciousness and a little,
we extracted it and we put in this 

1768
01:17:59,691 --> 01:18:01,160
beaker and now we weighed it.

1769
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:02,383
Consciousness is a 28 grams or whatever.
Remember that stupid thing that people 

1770
01:18:06,031 --> 01:18:07,420
always think when you died,
right?

1771
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,513
Yeah.
Twenty,

1772
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:12,630
21 grams yet 21 grams.
But what?

1773
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:17,830
Imagine if that was the case and before 
that all happened,

1774
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:20,490
you went and downloaded,
your brain does some super computer,

1775
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,390
right,
so you got to use.

1776
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:27,180
You got one that lives in hell on earth,
living forever,

1777
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:31,610
never going to die.
Just one mundane trip to starbucks after

1778
01:18:31,611 --> 01:18:35,510
another and you just try it out.
You're trapped in a computer,

1779
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:40,220
which is what Ray Kurzweil is saying.
Like what if like you would if they give

1780
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:41,900
you the opportunity to be trapped into 
computer,

1781
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:45,530
but you're trapped in an iphone one 
essentially once you're in,

1782
01:18:45,531 --> 01:18:49,700
you're in like you can either wait and 
hang on for a few years and you will get

1783
01:18:49,701 --> 01:18:50,534
a really good computer.
We're thinking quantum computers are 

1784
01:18:53,391 --> 01:18:55,070
going to go live around 20,
30,

1785
01:18:55,071 --> 01:18:56,180
20,
32,

1786
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:59,450
but we can get you in now looking 
pretty.

1787
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:00,650
You're coughing a lot,
Mike.

1788
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,153
I mean,
well it's like with the cryonics people 

1789
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,170
and I remind people,
you know,

1790
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:08,390
you're being frozen on the worst day of 
your life.

1791
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,300
You know the,
they,

1792
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:13,100
you died and you can't do it earlier 
because the state treats it as a form of

1793
01:19:13,101 --> 01:19:14,750
burial legally.
So you can't be,

1794
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:15,763
you can't get the treatment and the 
fruit in the injected with the 

1795
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,033
antifreeze and all that before you were 
actually dead or how they inject you 

1796
01:19:21,201 --> 01:19:23,940
with antifreeze yet type of antifreeze 
that,

1797
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:27,230
the purpose of that while your dad.
So it doesn't really matter,

1798
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:31,280
but the purpose is to keep the cells 
from shattering the freezing process.

1799
01:19:31,281 --> 01:19:32,114
We'll do that.
So they've gotten much better about 

1800
01:19:33,741 --> 01:19:34,574
that.
And what's actually frozen is this sort 

1801
01:19:36,051 --> 01:19:39,130
of gelatinous mass that's,
that's vitrified.

1802
01:19:39,131 --> 01:19:40,910
It's called vitrification process.
So it's,

1803
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,313
it's,
it's a little bit like a member of the 

1804
01:19:43,461 --> 01:19:44,294
touring the bodies where they had the 
dissected bodies and they were sort of 

1805
01:19:47,481 --> 01:19:49,400
this hard plastic plasticine.

1806
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:50,630
The plasticine.
Yeah.

1807
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,730
So this vitrification is sorta like 
that.

1808
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,930
And then that's frozen.
And uh,

1809
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:57,590
as far as we need,
as far as I'm concerned,

1810
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:58,693
everyone frozen to date,
including Ted Williams in his head in 

1811
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:04,010
Arizona,
there will never be brought back.

1812
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:06,640
Isn't Walt Disney frozen?
I trust that.

1813
01:20:06,641 --> 01:20:11,641
Then it turns out they alcor cryonics 
foundation opened its doors and released

1814
01:20:12,081 --> 01:20:14,370
a press release the same day Walt Disney
died.

1815
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:19,100
And these two stories that.
Yeah,

1816
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,150
yeah,
that makes sense to Williams.

1817
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:23,003
One is sad because they didn't have the 
money for the whole body's took his 

1818
01:20:25,711 --> 01:20:26,544
head.
All right,

1819
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:31,260
fuck.
It actually isn't that expensive because

1820
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:34,350
if you.
The way the way alcor and the other orgs

1821
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:35,184
do it is you take out an insurance 
policy on your life and you make them 

1822
01:20:38,131 --> 01:20:41,940
the beneficiary of the insurance policy.
So if you started young,

1823
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:44,310
you had say a quarter million dollar 
insurance policy,

1824
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:46,500
a few hundred dollars a year in 
premiums.

1825
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:49,290
He started super late.
The premiums would be much higher,

1826
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:50,523
but it's not like you're shelling out a 
quarter million dollars right at your 

1827
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:57,891
checkbook and then when you do die,
what happens if you get defrosted?

1828
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:59,490
Because that has happened,
right?

1829
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,610
Having done well.
Oh well what happens is as you look like

1830
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:05,310
a bowl of melted strawberries that were 
frozen,

1831
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:06,503
it's just,
it's just much that happened to one of 

1832
01:21:09,421 --> 01:21:12,030
the companies that does this.
They had a power outage,

1833
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:13,620
right?
Yeah.

1834
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,150
You don't want that.
Yeah.

1835
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,850
I'm not sure whether in Alcor is in 
Arizona.

1836
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,950
I made.
That's a terrible place.

1837
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,113
Shouldn't they be like in Antarctica and
there's other deeper issues with this 

1838
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:27,780
whole idea because if you're going to be
frozen for a thousand years or so,

1839
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:28,853
what's to say that the state of Arizona 
is going to be around where the 

1840
01:21:30,961 --> 01:21:33,210
government or the company that keeps the
lights on?

1841
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:34,043
Everything under water or anything.
Could anything transport your body and 

1842
01:21:38,371 --> 01:21:41,460
some sort of one of the big Ole Electric
Tesla trucks.

1843
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:44,250
Big Cooler.
It'll send you to Mars.

1844
01:21:44,251 --> 01:21:45,750
Yeah,
send me some new spot.

1845
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:47,213
Yeah.
Cool.

1846
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:49,650
Uh,
and again,

1847
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:50,553
um,
would,

1848
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:51,403
if they somehow jumpstarted the body,
would you wake up like you just had a 

1849
01:21:55,141 --> 01:21:56,790
long sleep?
Would you still be in there?

1850
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:00,210
I'm not at all sure that you wouldn't 
just be something like if they,

1851
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:02,340
if the memories weren't preserved very 
well,

1852
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:07,140
then it would just be a Zombie.
If you don't know who you are,

1853
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,610
there's no point in doing it.
I think the idea is freeze you.

1854
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:12,503
And then one day they'll have the 
technology to throw you out and 

1855
01:22:14,311 --> 01:22:15,144
everything's going to be amazing.
And there'll be able to reverse aging 

1856
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:19,760
and bring you back to when you're 18.
That's right,

1857
01:22:19,761 --> 01:22:22,290
yeah,
but here's the thing about memories,

1858
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:27,750
what like if you do die and say if you 
do go to heaven,

1859
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,270
you have the memories of your life.

1860
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,873
Are Those memories just like the 
memories of today fallible and 

1861
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:37,650
squirreling.
Right,

1862
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:39,540
and if they're not,
then that's not really you.

1863
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:40,823
And if God resurrects you physically,
what's to stop you from aging and 

1864
01:22:44,221 --> 01:22:45,720
getting Alzheimer's or whatever.
Well,

1865
01:22:45,721 --> 01:22:47,940
God's gonna prevent that by 
reengineering you.

1866
01:22:47,941 --> 01:22:48,774
Well then that's not really me.
That's up there at some super human 

1867
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:52,643
transhuman.
I had a conversation with some friends 

1868
01:22:54,481 --> 01:22:55,314
of mine who are Mormon and they couldn't
believe that I don't have religious 

1869
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:02,790
feelings and one of the things that this
lady said to me,

1870
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:03,750
I'll never forget,
she goes,

1871
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:07,660
you don't believe in afterlife.
How do you get up in the morning?

1872
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,900
Literally what she said,
how do you get up?

1873
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,000
And I go,
I love life here.

1874
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,373
I enjoy this experience.
I am enjoying being here at dinner with 

1875
01:23:16,931 --> 01:23:19,330
you guys.
I'm going to do some stuff tomorrow.

1876
01:23:19,331 --> 01:23:21,100
I've got planned out looking forward to 
it.

1877
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,920
I got like,
don't you enjoy your time?

1878
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:24,754
Like does everything have to be for a 
reward some place that you're not even 

1879
01:23:29,231 --> 01:23:31,960
totally sure exist after we're done 
here?

1880
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:33,123
It's such a weird thing to say because I
don't think they even think about that 

1881
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,930
and I'd get seriously doubt.
She wakes up in the morning goes,

1882
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:39,430
okay,
because there's an afterlife.

1883
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:41,560
I'm feeling good about life and I'm 
going to get up.

1884
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:44,740
I doubt it.
I think it alleviates the pressure and I

1885
01:23:44,741 --> 01:23:47,830
think that's a big part of what it,
what it is for people.

1886
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,740
It.
It alleviates the concern for the future

1887
01:23:50,741 --> 01:23:51,131
like,
Oh,

1888
01:23:51,131 --> 01:23:52,660
you don't have to worry.
God's got it.

1889
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,110
God's going to take care of it.
Right?

1890
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:55,063
Everything happens for a reason.
God's going to take everything does 

1891
01:23:57,521 --> 01:23:59,760
happen for a reason after it happens,
right?

1892
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,491
That's right.
Yeah.

1893
01:24:00,491 --> 01:24:01,900
After it's over,
you can go back and go,

1894
01:24:01,901 --> 01:24:03,010
yeah,
it happened for a reason,

1895
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:05,890
so it became this and that became who I 
am.

1896
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,500
So it all happened for a reason.
That's right.

1897
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,830
Okay.
Yeah,

1898
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:09,783
you're right.
But of course it usually what they made 

1899
01:24:12,391 --> 01:24:14,500
is somebody pulling the strings to make 
it happen.

1900
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:18,250
Not just the pathway that you happen to 
have gone down.

1901
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,233
Exactly.
They always mean that God has some 

1902
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:24,310
grand,
very mysterious plan and kind of see how

1903
01:24:24,311 --> 01:24:25,210
that feels good.
Like,

1904
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:26,650
okay,
I'm not alone.

1905
01:24:26,651 --> 01:24:27,484
There's somebody watching that after me,
not just my spouse and my friends and 

1906
01:24:30,221 --> 01:24:32,130
family,
but you know,

1907
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:35,260
somebody out there somewhere and I can 
see why that feels good.

1908
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:37,160
So this is the problem atheists have,
you know,

1909
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:38,263
it dot talks about this,
like what do you say to somebody that's 

1910
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:45,220
dying?
It's like the Ricky Gervais' movie,

1911
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:46,320
the invention of line,
you know,

1912
01:24:46,321 --> 01:24:48,460
where he goes,
he tells his mom,

1913
01:24:48,461 --> 01:24:49,120
well,
you know,

1914
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,560
you get,
you get a mansion,

1915
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:53,470
everyone who dies gets a mansion,
a mansion.

1916
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,341
Oh yeah,
it's great.

1917
01:24:54,341 --> 01:24:57,280
And he goes on and then 10 minutes later
in the movie,

1918
01:24:57,281 --> 01:24:59,290
he's the Messiah because this meme got 
out.

1919
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:00,900
You know,
it's a great story and you know,

1920
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:02,320
so we,
we can't do that.

1921
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,240
If you're honest,
you can't make up a story.

1922
01:25:04,241 --> 01:25:07,840
So what do you say?
So in secular humanist circles,

1923
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:09,940
it was articles about that.
What do you say?

1924
01:25:09,941 --> 01:25:11,400
And it's hard,
you know,

1925
01:25:11,401 --> 01:25:12,820
you can't,
you can't promise it,

1926
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:13,654
but,
you know,

1927
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:16,210
reminding people of what a great life 
they've had,

1928
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,610
you know,
how much they've influenced the lives of

1929
01:25:18,611 --> 01:25:20,170
other people,
you know,

1930
01:25:20,171 --> 01:25:22,510
and so on.
That's really all we have.

1931
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:23,413
And um,
you used the line from Woody Allen in 

1932
01:25:25,331 --> 01:25:25,780
there,
you know,

1933
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:27,880
who says I don't want to live on,
in my work I want to live on,

1934
01:25:27,881 --> 01:25:30,460
in my apartment.
Okay.

1935
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:32,430
I understand.
And uh,

1936
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:34,120
but we,
we don't get to do that.

1937
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:35,260
No,
we do not.

1938
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:38,590
And again,
I want to go back to what I said earlier

1939
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:43,540
is that you are enjoying this partially 
because it's temporary.

1940
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:48,640
It's part of the thing about a day.
Like you don't want to stay up forever,

1941
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:49,563
right?
You want to enjoy the day and then at 

1942
01:25:51,911 --> 01:25:52,744
the end it's over.
And that day is a microcosm of your 

1943
01:25:55,001 --> 01:25:56,320
life.
Yeah.

1944
01:25:56,321 --> 01:25:57,310
It's kind of fun to think,
okay,

1945
01:25:57,311 --> 01:25:59,020
I got eight hours here before,
you know,

1946
01:25:59,021 --> 01:26:00,400
it's dinnertime and,
and so on.

1947
01:26:00,401 --> 01:26:01,234
So I got to get my workout in and I get 
to write this and I get to make these 

1948
01:26:04,191 --> 01:26:06,210
calls.
And it's kind of fun to kind of see how,

1949
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:08,420
if you can squeeze it all in.
Yeah.

1950
01:26:08,421 --> 01:26:12,290
And knowing that there is a time,
if it was a 20 hour window,

1951
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:13,140
I,
you know,

1952
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,750
I just started fucking around and like,
Eh,

1953
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,193
get plenty of times I find I get more 
done as a person who's very busy with a 

1954
01:26:22,821 --> 01:26:24,920
family and children and all that stuff.

1955
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:25,783
Right.
I feel like I get more done because I 

1956
01:26:26,991 --> 01:26:30,680
don't have time to fuck off.
I very rarely have time to fuck off.

1957
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:33,740
Yeah.
I've been distracted the last six months

1958
01:26:33,741 --> 01:26:34,574
or a year or so with a following twitter
feeds that send interesting articles to 

1959
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:40,070
read,
which are interesting articles.

1960
01:26:40,071 --> 01:26:42,230
There's a ton of really good content out
there.

1961
01:26:42,231 --> 01:26:43,890
And then podcasts,
your podcast,

1962
01:26:43,891 --> 01:26:46,080
sams and Dave Rubin and,
and,

1963
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:47,480
and you know,
just like,

1964
01:26:47,481 --> 01:26:48,740
wow,
this is all good.

1965
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,300
I really want to consume,
but wait a minute,

1966
01:26:50,301 --> 01:26:51,740
wait a minute,
I'm not getting my workout in,

1967
01:26:51,741 --> 01:26:52,760
I'm not doing this.
And it's like,

1968
01:26:52,761 --> 01:26:54,950
okay.
So it's a good problem to have.

1969
01:26:54,951 --> 01:26:56,930
It's a first world problem to have as 
they say.

1970
01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:58,603
And I think what the transhumanists and 
the Ray Kurzweil thank is heaven would 

1971
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:04,990
be something like that.
Just endless streams of content that you

1972
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:08,460
enlist twitter feed.
That's true.

1973
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,290
Maybe that's not good.
Yeah.

1974
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:12,270
I don't know.
It could be hell yeah.

1975
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:15,080
I don't know what he wants.
I mean I don't.

1976
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:18,590
The living forever thing is very 
problematic.

1977
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:20,240
It's like what?
You are,

1978
01:27:20,241 --> 01:27:22,260
be so outdated.
Right?

1979
01:27:22,261 --> 01:27:23,000
You know,
you know,

1980
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,290
100 years.
Yes,

1981
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,240
totally.
I just.

1982
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,420
And the downloading yourself into a 
computer thing too.

1983
01:27:29,421 --> 01:27:30,254
What's to stop a guy like Kim Jong wound
from downloading himself 100 times or a 

1984
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:36,780
thousand or do it every day.
Well,

1985
01:27:36,890 --> 01:27:37,723
every day makes a new Kim Jong Il.
This is one reason that these cult 

1986
01:27:40,101 --> 01:27:40,934
leaders,
they do try to do that through lots of 

1987
01:27:44,391 --> 01:27:46,130
sex.
That is kind of what they're doing.

1988
01:27:46,131 --> 01:27:46,671
Right,
right.

1989
01:27:46,671 --> 01:27:47,700
Yeah.
Wow.

1990
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:49,580
Setting,
they're setting their genes out into the

1991
01:27:49,581 --> 01:27:52,010
future as much as they can.
Let me ask you this then.

1992
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:55,460
What is that?
Why does that instinct exist?

1993
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:58,740
Like is that a purely approcreation 
instinct?

1994
01:27:58,760 --> 01:27:59,510
Yeah,
I think so.

1995
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:00,343
Yeah.
So you think that's the religious cult 

1996
01:28:01,761 --> 01:28:02,594
leader instincts?
It's based entirely on some ancient 

1997
01:28:04,911 --> 01:28:09,290
reward system that's designed to get you
to gingiss con your jeans out throughout

1998
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:09,950
the.
Yeah,

1999
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:11,400
absolutely.
Yeah.

2000
01:28:11,401 --> 01:28:12,140
You know,
there's A.

2001
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:14,660
I have a chapter there and why?
Why do we have to die?

2002
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,290
I mean,
what?

2003
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:18,400
Why can't we just be programmed like 
infants are and babies,

2004
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:19,293
you know,
the cells divide rapidly and they're 

2005
01:28:20,901 --> 01:28:23,420
super healthy.
I have a young son now,

2006
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:24,440
he's 20 months.
You know,

2007
01:28:24,441 --> 01:28:26,600
when he gets a little cut,
you could practically watch it heal.

2008
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:27,434
It's just incredible.
And yet when I get a cut at 63 and it 

2009
01:28:29,751 --> 01:28:30,980
takes a couple of weeks to heal,
it's like,

2010
01:28:30,981 --> 01:28:32,990
why can't I?
Can't the system keep going?

2011
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:35,330
And the answer is twofold.
And second,

2012
01:28:35,331 --> 01:28:36,800
law of thermodynamics,
entropy,

2013
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:37,703
everything is running down and second 
natural selection programmed us to stay 

2014
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:41,414
alive long enough to keep it,
get our children's children into the 

2015
01:28:43,971 --> 01:28:45,950
reproductive age.
After that,

2016
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:51,200
given that we have limited resources and
energy in the system we live in,

2017
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:55,160
it's better to allocate the resources to
the third generation say,

2018
01:28:55,161 --> 01:28:57,320
rather than you,
you don't need to live 150,

2019
01:28:57,321 --> 01:28:58,790
200 years,
60,

2020
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:02,130
70 years.
Your children's children are now in

2021
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,620
their early twenties and having babies,
you're done.

2022
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,070
As far as natural selection is 
concerned.

2023
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:07,913
Now I say it in a way like there's the 
czar of the secretary of the treasury 

2024
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:13,860
that's allocating resources.
You know,

2025
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:16,260
there's nothing like that.
It's just natural selection.

2026
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:21,070
Selecting things for whatever's best for
survival to get genes into the,

2027
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,233
into the future.
So this is Dawkins' argument in the 

2028
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:27,390
selfish gene that that the gene is the 
is.

2029
01:29:27,391 --> 01:29:29,610
This is the thing we should be focused 
on,

2030
01:29:29,611 --> 01:29:30,444
not the body.
That natural selection kind of operates 

2031
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:33,564
on the body,
the phenotype that that gets expressed 

2032
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:36,383
in a physical body,
but the body's are just survival 

2033
01:29:39,031 --> 01:29:42,210
machines that the replicators build to 
keep going.

2034
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:46,140
So the replicators are immortal.
The species is a mortal.

2035
01:29:46,141 --> 01:29:47,700
In a sense.
Our genome is a moral.

2036
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:50,730
That's why toxins called that river out 
of Eden.

2037
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,253
One of his book title that says that the
river out of Eden is eternal as long as 

2038
01:29:56,101 --> 01:29:57,750
our species doesn't go extinct.

2039
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:58,600
Uh,
we,

2040
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,460
we live forever,
but you and I as a,

2041
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:05,880
as just survival machines were just the 
gene's way of keeping itself to the next

2042
01:30:05,881 --> 01:30:08,820
generation.
So you're really only good for maybe 60,

2043
01:30:08,821 --> 01:30:11,890
70 years for a human timescale.
You know,

2044
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,040
your kids,
kids get to survival age,

2045
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:17,700
you're done.
And this is the problem of that.

2046
01:30:17,701 --> 01:30:21,660
All the radical life extension has had 
the whole system starts to fall apart at

2047
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:24,060
around the same time,
like mid to late eighties.

2048
01:30:24,061 --> 01:30:24,894
Things start falling apart.
If you can make it into your nineties 

2049
01:30:27,241 --> 01:30:29,310
and you're still reasonably healthy,
that's really good.

2050
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:32,450
Maybe you had Mel Gibson and his doc on,
you know,

2051
01:30:32,451 --> 01:30:33,284
with the stem cells,
all that stuff is only going to push 

2052
01:30:35,401 --> 01:30:38,290
this further further more of us to the 
upper ceiling.

2053
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:39,783
We're not going to break through that 
upper sending about 120 without 

2054
01:30:41,681 --> 01:30:44,520
something hugely,
completely re-engineered.

2055
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:45,383
There may be a crisper technology that 
re engineered the genome to stop all 

2056
01:30:49,031 --> 01:30:50,420
this stuff from happening.
But you know,

2057
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:51,453
we have 4 billion years,
well three and a half billion years or 

2058
01:30:53,141 --> 01:30:53,974
so of life,
of that continuity of the genome and 

2059
01:30:58,331 --> 01:31:00,970
it's all built into there.
And every single system,

2060
01:31:00,971 --> 01:31:02,650
every cell,
all parts of your yourself,

2061
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:05,980
they're all going to age.
And so,

2062
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,200
you know,
when people like Aubrey de grey,

2063
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:09,770
I don't know if you know,
got that long.

2064
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:10,361
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2065
01:31:10,361 --> 01:31:12,850
He's great.
I love this guy and I love that.

2066
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:13,693
That beer is his favorite thing that he 
thinks is going to be part of the 

2067
01:31:15,701 --> 01:31:16,460
process.
Okay.

2068
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:19,650
I'll have a few beers if this is going 
to help and even if it.

2069
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:20,923
That's okay.
Yeah.

2070
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,450
That was one of the things that may be 
most skeptical of him.

2071
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:29,010
It was at the beer that's an amino 
suppressant drinking poison.

2072
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,200
Yeah.
I mean it's a mild poison.

2073
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,273
That's delicious model.
That's not good to drink this shit all 

2074
01:31:35,631 --> 01:31:36,830
day long.
I was like,

2075
01:31:36,831 --> 01:31:37,664
this is weird.
And I was talking to somebody that 

2076
01:31:38,711 --> 01:31:40,700
interviewed him and said he was clearly 
drunk,

2077
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:42,320
like I was like,
really?

2078
01:31:42,321 --> 01:31:42,981
And she was like,
yeah,

2079
01:31:42,981 --> 01:31:43,814
I interviewed him.
He was drunk drinking beer and he was 

2080
01:31:45,951 --> 01:31:47,840
drunk and she was like,
and it wasn't.

2081
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:52,370
It wasn't late in the day either.
Started started is just gets hammered.

2082
01:31:52,371 --> 01:31:54,980
Does Science Fountain of Youth Very 
early?

2083
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:57,410
Yeah.
He's a fascinating guy too,

2084
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,800
because he's not really much for 
exercise either.

2085
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:03,070
Now a nutrition,
a lot of these guys that are into this,

2086
01:32:03,071 --> 01:32:03,700
they don't.
To me,

2087
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:04,720
they don't look healthy.

2088
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:06,060
No,
no.

2089
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:06,963
It's the one thing we know for sure in 
terms of longevity to get you closer to 

2090
01:32:10,901 --> 01:32:12,910
the upper ceiling and more of is don't 
smoke.

2091
01:32:12,911 --> 01:32:15,190
Don't drink too much.
Exercise every day.

2092
01:32:15,191 --> 01:32:17,100
Especially Cardio,
you know,

2093
01:32:17,101 --> 01:32:18,130
and,
and just eat right.

2094
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:19,870
Eat healthy foods.
Whole foods,

2095
01:32:19,871 --> 01:32:22,120
you know that I'm relieved to hear you 
know that.

2096
01:32:22,121 --> 01:32:24,940
Meat and eggs and butter.
This is all okay now.

2097
01:32:24,941 --> 01:32:25,774
Good.
Because it always felt like this was a 

2098
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:31,260
balance with the salads.
Salads are good too.

2099
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:33,520
What's good?
What's not good?

2100
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:36,580
Sugar is the devil.
That's the worst.

2101
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,770
That's right.
And it's amazing how.

2102
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:41,890
Now I love listening to your podcasts 
with Nina Teicholz.

2103
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:42,430
Tie.
Shoulds.

2104
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:44,740
Yes.
Because I totally related to the,

2105
01:32:44,741 --> 01:32:45,880
you know,
I went through my.

2106
01:32:45,881 --> 01:32:50,800
No meat stage and I just eat down in 
these huge bowls of quaker Granola,

2107
01:32:51,370 --> 01:32:55,470
which is incredibly addictive because 
it's sugar and this.

2108
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:59,170
I was cycling a lot and I wasn't.
Not only was I not losing weight,

2109
01:32:59,171 --> 01:33:02,080
I'm putting weight on.
I got to like carrying around this extra

2110
01:33:02,081 --> 01:33:04,480
10 pounds,
but I'm eating granola.

2111
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:06,940
It's healthy.
No.

2112
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:08,823
Well,
especially the Granola that most people 

2113
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:12,250
bothered us.
Sugar just laced all over it.

2114
01:33:12,251 --> 01:33:12,971
Yeah.
Yeah.

2115
01:33:12,971 --> 01:33:15,880
There's a lot of people that eat things 
that they think are healthy.

2116
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:18,520
There's this great bread that my wife 
brought home.

2117
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:21,790
It was like a dave's super bread or some
shit like that.

2118
01:33:21,791 --> 01:33:24,460
I forget what it's called,
but I bit into it and I was like,

2119
01:33:24,461 --> 01:33:26,950
this is,
this is cake.

2120
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:28,900
Yes.
This might as well be cake.

2121
01:33:28,901 --> 01:33:31,750
And then I looked at it and there's like
massive amounts of sugar.

2122
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:33,110
Absolutely.
Oh,

2123
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,053
okay.
I didn't even realize how much sugar is 

2124
01:33:36,221 --> 01:33:38,620
in bread till my wife's from Cologne,
Germany,

2125
01:33:38,621 --> 01:33:39,431
Jennifer,
and you know,

2126
01:33:39,431 --> 01:33:41,350
they,
they have real bread in Germany.

2127
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:44,050
I mean you pick up a loaf of bread,
it's like four pounds.

2128
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:44,884
It's like a thing,
a lead because it's got nuts and it's 

2129
01:33:47,051 --> 01:33:51,010
super heavy and rich and there's no 
sugar and it tastes very different,

2130
01:33:51,011 --> 01:33:53,140
but once you get used to it,
it's way better.

2131
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:54,213
Well,
it's also they're dealing with heirloom 

2132
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:56,374
wheat in most of the European countries.
What we've done from I guess the early 

2133
01:34:00,611 --> 01:34:04,780
19 hundreds of slowly change what we 
used to be into.

2134
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:09,250
My friend Maynard explained it to me 
because he has a restaurant and he get.

2135
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:10,133
They grow pasta that's from heirloom 
wheat and he said that the wheat that 

2136
01:34:14,291 --> 01:34:18,040
you're getting today,
we have the same amount of acres.

2137
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:21,310
You get a much higher yield is a bigger 
plant.

2138
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:22,173
It's a big fluffy thing and it also has 
much more complex gluten's in it so 

2139
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:28,510
people have more of an issue digesting 
it.

2140
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:29,613
You're getting like a lot more gluten 
insensitivity today than we've ever had 

2141
01:34:34,121 --> 01:34:37,840
before and that's all because of this 
manipulated wheat.

2142
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:39,013
So we started buying pasta from Italy.
You can get heirloom pasta that's grown 

2143
01:34:44,471 --> 01:34:46,480
in Europe and it just.
It tastes different.

2144
01:34:46,481 --> 01:34:47,314
It makes you feel different when you.
It doesn't feel like a brick in your 

2145
01:34:49,421 --> 01:34:50,161
stomach.
Right?

2146
01:34:50,161 --> 01:34:51,310
I mean,
it's still pasta.

2147
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:52,660
It's still carbohydrates.
It's,

2148
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:53,553
it's not the best stuff for you,
but it's certainly better and it gives 

2149
01:34:56,321 --> 01:34:58,070
your body a better or feeling,

2150
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,150
right?
Yup.

2151
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:01,280
Bread without sugar.
Pasta without sugar.

2152
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:02,720
Yeah.
Well you're going to get some.

2153
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:03,531
Yeah.
It's just,

2154
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:04,730
it's different.
It's,

2155
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:07,400
and you know,
bread like bread is just bread.

2156
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,450
It's not good for you.

2157
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:09,523
It's not.
I love that story from Gary Tubbs that 

2158
01:35:11,061 --> 01:35:11,571
um,
you know,

2159
01:35:11,571 --> 01:35:12,660
when they started,
uh,

2160
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:14,830
taking,
um,

2161
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:19,040
when they started making the transition 
from eating meat to eating carbohydrates

2162
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:20,263
and it tasted like crap.
It's like people don't want to eat 

2163
01:35:22,641 --> 01:35:23,474
cardboard,
so we got to put something in there to 

2164
01:35:24,321 --> 01:35:25,550
make it taste good.
Sugar.

2165
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:26,493
Yup.
He was like,

2166
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:27,800
oh,
right.

2167
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:28,663
That was like 19 sixties,
late fifties after Eisenhower had his 

2168
01:35:30,831 --> 01:35:31,664
heart attack.
And then that whole meme of the dietary 

2169
01:35:34,191 --> 01:35:37,610
fat equals a cardiovascular heart 
disease.

2170
01:35:37,611 --> 01:35:38,430
Okay.

2171
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:39,263
Well,
I'm sure you read the New York Times 

2172
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:40,734
article about how the sugar industry 
bribe scientists to say that sugar was 

2173
01:35:44,491 --> 01:35:47,430
the issue with heart disease and to take
the blame,

2174
01:35:47,490 --> 01:35:48,323
excuse me,
to take the blame off sugar and put the 

2175
01:35:50,281 --> 01:35:53,490
blame on saturated fat.
It's stunning.

2176
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,353
It's stunning how many people to this 
day will just parrot that back and the 

2177
01:35:58,090 --> 01:36:00,510
fact that saturated fat is terrible for 
it,

2178
01:36:00,511 --> 01:36:01,920
right?
Like meanwhile,

2179
01:36:01,921 --> 01:36:04,050
it's no cholesterol terrible for,
you know,

2180
01:36:04,051 --> 01:36:06,450
it's actually the building blocks for 
hormones,

2181
01:36:06,451 --> 01:36:07,284
right?
It's literally the substrate for 

2182
01:36:09,061 --> 01:36:10,040
hormones,
right?

2183
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,600
That's what your body is made of,
the cell,

2184
01:36:12,630 --> 01:36:15,450
the cell walls,
or you need cholesterol to build those.

2185
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:16,830
Say that.
The people that like,

2186
01:36:16,831 --> 01:36:18,990
what are you talking about?
You're crazy.

2187
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:21,990
Less going to kill you.
It's going to kill you.

2188
01:36:21,991 --> 01:36:23,280
Michael Shermer,
right?

2189
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:24,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

2190
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,430
It's weird.
Nina's book is excellent,

2191
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:28,170
and then there's quite a few books.

2192
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:30,150
Gary Tobbs book is excellent as well.
There's,

2193
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:31,703
you know,
there's a lot of people now that are 

2194
01:36:32,551 --> 01:36:34,400
shifting their diet over to,
you know me,

2195
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:39,090
you can call it Paleo or Marxists and 
calls it primal primal blueprint.

2196
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:44,280
Essentially just eating vegetables and 
fish and meat and eating healthy things,

2197
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:47,460
eating Avocados and coconut oil and you 
know,

2198
01:36:47,461 --> 01:36:50,220
and healthy fats and that's what your 
body craves.

2199
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,690
Right.
And once you get used to it,

2200
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:52,553
one of the things that's incredibly 
beneficial is I tell people I don't get 

2201
01:36:55,561 --> 01:36:57,120
hungry during the day.
Like most people,

2202
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:58,790
I'm not starving.
Right.

2203
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:00,930
And I don't crash,
like I don't need an,

2204
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:02,090
I don't need naps.
Like what,

2205
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:04,230
what do you have for breakfast or before
you eat?

2206
01:37:04,231 --> 01:37:05,064
Before a workout or after I eat after a 
workout when I like to do is fasted 

2207
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:11,550
cardio.
Usually run in the morning or do yoga in

2208
01:37:11,551 --> 01:37:14,310
the morning with no,
no food in my stomach.

2209
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:18,370
So it's like 11 or 12 before you eat.
Or I had eggs and eggs for breakfast.

2210
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:21,320
Yeah.
And Avocado and um,

2211
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:22,243
you know,
like last night I had steak and I'm an 

2212
01:37:24,151 --> 01:37:24,984
avocado.
Like I'm eating mostly that'll hold you 

2213
01:37:26,881 --> 01:37:30,330
through the workout about 10 or 11 in 
the morning and I'm fine now.

2214
01:37:30,331 --> 01:37:33,480
What we have after a workout,
um,

2215
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:35,610
depends.
Maybe a protein shake.

2216
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:39,930
I'm really depends entirely.
Today haven't worked out yet.

2217
01:37:39,931 --> 01:37:41,690
So I just had breakfast,
right,

2218
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:44,820
but most of what I'm eating is whole 
foods,

2219
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:48,570
healthy whole foods.
I'd still eat plenty of salad.

2220
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:49,404
I still yet,
but I very rarely I'll indulge and 

2221
01:37:52,261 --> 01:37:54,480
carbohydrates,
like I had a cheeseburger from five guys

2222
01:37:54,481 --> 01:37:55,314
on Sunday.

2223
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,770
Every now and then I'll dive in.
That's right.

2224
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:01,560
I think if you're working out a lot you 
can.

2225
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,420
He can tolerate a little bit more of 
that.

2226
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:05,340
Yeah.
Just give yourself a little cheat day.

2227
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:07,290
You feel better about it.
You don't feel.

2228
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:09,870
You feel like you're constantly 
depriving yourself.

2229
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:12,840
But overall I feel great.
Yeah.

2230
01:38:12,841 --> 01:38:16,380
We do some long three hour bike rides up
in Santa Barbara where I live now.

2231
01:38:16,381 --> 01:38:19,200
There's a group at pretty seriously 
effected by.

2232
01:38:19,370 --> 01:38:19,730
No,
no,

2233
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:21,730
I was just north of that.
The firearms.

2234
01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:23,400
Yeah.
But I was trapped there,

2235
01:38:23,401 --> 01:38:24,780
you know,
it was like being on an island.

2236
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:28,740
The only way out is to go five hours 
north and around to get to La.

2237
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:29,693
Really?
Yeah.

2238
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:30,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

2239
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:32,053
For about three weeks.
The only way to get to La is you had to 

2240
01:38:33,481 --> 01:38:34,314
go up to Santa Maria,
take the one 66 over the five year 

2241
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:40,200
practically in Bakersfield and then five
south to la.

2242
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:41,000
Yes.
Yeah.

2243
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,220
So the one on one was shut down,
completely shut down and all that.

2244
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:48,660
There's only like a feud side roads that
parallel and they were all close because

2245
01:38:48,661 --> 01:38:51,650
they were covered in mud and also all 
the trucks and um,

2246
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:52,613
and,
and equipment that construction 

2247
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:58,080
equipment to get the mud out of there.
They just opened it to a Sunday night.

2248
01:38:58,300 --> 01:38:59,133
That's incredible.
So for awhile they had fairies at a 

2249
01:39:01,261 --> 01:39:06,060
ferry from Santa Barbara to Ventura.
Of course you take the ferry Ventura,

2250
01:39:06,061 --> 01:39:07,400
then you don't have a car.
Then you know,

2251
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:10,050
you get an uber to la or something 
crazy.

2252
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:16,320
Mud slides were insane.
CDOT Oprah,

2253
01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:18,900
Oprah was there the next day.
I think she must've.

2254
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:20,470
Helicopter didn't obviously,
but uh,

2255
01:39:20,471 --> 01:39:24,020
Mr. House by like 50 feet,
something like that.

2256
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:27,480
Oprah is their magic.
We may have injured.

2257
01:39:27,481 --> 01:39:28,314
See,
we may have another western White House 

2258
01:39:29,551 --> 01:39:30,384
in Santa Barbara,
the Reagan ranch where he had his 

2259
01:39:33,841 --> 01:39:35,700
western White House houses north of 
Santa Barbara.

2260
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:38,010
You think Oprah is going to win?
She's going to run for president.

2261
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,660
She,
I don't know if she's going to run,

2262
01:39:39,661 --> 01:39:41,610
but I.
The world we live in now.

2263
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:42,810
She could.
When you think so.

2264
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:44,700
She's a pretty good speaker.
She's not bad.

2265
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:45,890
She's a good speaker.
Yeah.

2266
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:47,580
This is what I always bring up with 
Oprah.

2267
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:50,550
Do you remember when Oprah was a big 
supporter of the secret?

2268
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:51,721
Oh,
totally.

2269
01:39:51,721 --> 01:39:52,554
Yes.
I know we've debunked her stuff because 

2270
01:39:53,431 --> 01:39:58,090
she's always open to woo woo stuff.
She was super open to that.

2271
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,940
She was,
we did the calculation.

2272
01:39:59,941 --> 01:40:01,740
She was like 50 then.
Yeah.

2273
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:04,890
She wasn't a young,
dumb kid and didn't know any better.

2274
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:06,450
Nope.
You know,

2275
01:40:06,451 --> 01:40:06,931
and uh,
I mean,

2276
01:40:06,931 --> 01:40:10,910
she's a living testimony to what you can
do if you put your mind to it,

2277
01:40:10,911 --> 01:40:12,600
you want,
use your intelligence and hard work.

2278
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:17,610
And she had a television show that was 
fun to watch and it was great for women.

2279
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:22,010
It was like she sort of,
she filled a niche that wasn't,

2280
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,550
wasn't filled before.
Yeah,

2281
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:24,961
there's some.
Okay.

2282
01:40:24,961 --> 01:40:25,794
So we have to make a distinction between
the kinds of things that say a Tony 

2283
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:32,130
Robbins or maybe even a Jordan Peterson 
would say,

2284
01:40:32,131 --> 01:40:32,531
like,
here,

2285
01:40:32,531 --> 01:40:35,400
here are some things you could do 
that'll help you be more successful,

2286
01:40:35,401 --> 01:40:36,630
you know,
set your goals,

2287
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:39,510
write them down every morning when you 
get up,

2288
01:40:39,511 --> 01:40:40,590
you have a plan,
you know,

2289
01:40:40,591 --> 01:40:43,290
like Jocko says,
you don't have your running your workout

2290
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:45,840
clothes ready to go so you're not 
fumbling around and give up,

2291
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:47,013
you know,
it's almost like you're betting on your 

2292
01:40:48,181 --> 01:40:50,340
future self.
I know this is what I'm going to be like

2293
01:40:50,341 --> 01:40:51,930
in 12 hours,
so I'm going to do something now.

2294
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:53,970
That's good.
Uh,

2295
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,180
you know,
in Jordan has his book.

2296
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:58,540
Here's the 12 things you gotta do to do 
what?

2297
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:59,590
Well,
to be successful.

2298
01:40:59,591 --> 01:41:00,790
Okay.
So,

2299
01:41:00,791 --> 01:41:01,571
you know,
Oprah Kinda,

2300
01:41:01,571 --> 01:41:04,180
I think did those things intuitively 
just as a,

2301
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:05,140
you know,
just what she did.

2302
01:41:05,141 --> 01:41:08,260
That's how she became successful,
which has nothing to do with.

2303
01:41:08,261 --> 01:41:11,230
If I tell the universe I want a 
Lamborghini,

2304
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:13,830
it's kind of up here in my driveway,
you know,

2305
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:14,840
and then,
then the,

2306
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:15,783
the other deeper problem with that was 
that this implies that what if I'm not 

2307
01:41:19,691 --> 01:41:21,370
successful?
You just weren't thinking positive.

2308
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:24,400
You mean these poor people in Somalia or
even worse.

2309
01:41:24,401 --> 01:41:27,250
What about children with the disease?
So they thinking,

2310
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:27,831
well,
yeah,

2311
01:41:27,831 --> 01:41:28,650
yeah.
It's no good.

2312
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:29,483
So the idea that you,
your entire existence is based entirely 

2313
01:41:32,561 --> 01:41:35,230
inside of your own imagination.
It's just preposterous.

2314
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:38,080
There's a lot of random shit that's 
going on in this world.

2315
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,330
Some parts of the world get hit by 
meteors.

2316
01:41:40,331 --> 01:41:41,860
Were they bad people there?
No.

2317
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:42,611
Well,
how come?

2318
01:41:42,611 --> 01:41:43,444
How come Putin didn't get hit by a 
meteor assassinating rivals and god is 

2319
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:51,213
still a.
It was just a lot of people out there 

2320
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:55,450
that are terrible people that just state
through.

2321
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:57,790
That's right.
Somehow or another problem of evil.

2322
01:41:57,850 --> 01:42:00,730
Why do bad things happen to good people?
And good things happen to bad?

2323
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:02,040
Sometimes they do.
Right?

2324
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:03,263
The problem with the,
the secret is that if you're successful 

2325
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:08,673
and you know you have this story of I 
just imagined it and I willed it into 

2326
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:15,550
being and look,
here I am,

2327
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:16,860
you can do it too,
right?

2328
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:21,370
I'm sorta how many people also willed it
into being.

2329
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:24,010
It didn't work.
Like let's get the full numbers.

2330
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:28,000
How many people daydreaming all day and 
they never got that pony.

2331
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:31,210
You know,
I call this the biography bias.

2332
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:33,730
People write biographies of Steve Jobs.
Okay,

2333
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:34,564
so here's the thing.
You enroll in a really elite college 

2334
01:42:36,341 --> 01:42:38,140
dropout.
Move back to your parents' house.

2335
01:42:38,141 --> 01:42:40,060
It started a startup company in your 
garage.

2336
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:45,150
It works actually how many people did 
this in the seventies and they did start

2337
01:42:45,621 --> 01:42:48,010
up companies and they went out of 
business in three months or whatever.

2338
01:42:48,011 --> 01:42:51,040
You have to have a good product now and 
no one writes a biography of them,

2339
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:53,680
right?
So we only hear the hits,

2340
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:55,960
forget the Mrs,
but at least those people,

2341
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:58,900
even if they failed,
they took a shot at something.

2342
01:42:58,901 --> 01:43:01,060
They're trying to make something happen.
It fails.

2343
01:43:01,061 --> 01:43:02,830
They could try something else.
And maybe the third,

2344
01:43:02,831 --> 01:43:04,300
fourth,
fifth one will take,

2345
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:05,553
but the idea of the secret is the most 
preposterous thing ever was because 

2346
01:43:07,511 --> 01:43:11,620
you're sitting around imagining that 
you're going to will it into existence,

2347
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:14,290
the perfect spouse,
the perfect home,

2348
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:15,124
the perfect family,
and you would just sit and dream about 

2349
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,900
it and write it down and put pictures of
it up on the wall.

2350
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:22,130
And then you would make it happen.
Like,

2351
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:23,440
no,
you got to go do things,

2352
01:43:23,441 --> 01:43:25,750
you gotta to do it and to do things.
And it's this.

2353
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:26,643
The one thing that keeps people from 
achieving things is the actually going 

2354
01:43:30,491 --> 01:43:32,950
out and doing things.
For whatever reason,

2355
01:43:32,951 --> 01:43:35,950
we have this blockade against action,
right?

2356
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:39,790
People are terrified of the unknown,
just like we're terrified of death,

2357
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:42,040
right?
Terrified of the unknown.

2358
01:43:42,370 --> 01:43:45,430
You have the role of chance is huge and 
we don't,

2359
01:43:45,431 --> 01:43:46,264
uh,
we,

2360
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:50,080
we forget to see the failures.
I was a ride the other day with a guy,

2361
01:43:50,081 --> 01:43:50,711
you know,
what do you do?

2362
01:43:50,711 --> 01:43:52,070
I'm a,
a venture

2363
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,900
capitalist.
So what's the ratio?

2364
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:54,621
I mean,
you have the,

2365
01:43:54,621 --> 01:43:56,730
you put in 200,000,
$500,000,

2366
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:58,320
half pay.
What?

2367
01:43:58,321 --> 01:43:59,000
And he goes,
no,

2368
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,140
90 percent fail because I get it.
I said,

2369
01:44:02,141 --> 01:44:02,974
you nine out of 10 companies,
you invest half a million or whatever 

2370
01:44:04,881 --> 01:44:05,421
it's gone.
He goes,

2371
01:44:05,421 --> 01:44:06,350
Yep.
But the one,

2372
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:09,050
you know,
the one I made $20 million dollars on,

2373
01:44:09,051 --> 01:44:09,884
you know,
more than makes up for the nine 

2374
01:44:10,581 --> 01:44:11,270
failures.
Like,

2375
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:13,100
Oh wow,
you know,

2376
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:15,470
that's a high ratio.
So there's,

2377
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:18,140
um,
I know there's research on entrepreneurs

2378
01:44:18,141 --> 01:44:18,974
and how risk taking you should be.
So entrepreneurs score high and risk 

2379
01:44:21,531 --> 01:44:22,071
taking,
you know,

2380
01:44:22,071 --> 01:44:22,660
they're,
they're,

2381
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:24,050
they're not risk averse.
Okay,

2382
01:44:24,051 --> 01:44:26,000
that's good.
But on the other hand,

2383
01:44:26,001 --> 01:44:28,880
some of them have what's called the over
optimism bias.

2384
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:30,230
They just never give up.
This is,

2385
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:32,180
this is the idea.
I'm sticking with it.

2386
01:44:32,181 --> 01:44:33,590
I'm going to keep pouring money into it.

2387
01:44:33,650 --> 01:44:34,483
No,
dude,

2388
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:37,270
nine out of 10 fail.
Just keep trying until you get the one.

2389
01:44:37,271 --> 01:44:39,200
You at some point you got to be a risk 
taker,

2390
01:44:39,201 --> 01:44:41,330
but not too crazy.
You gotta know when to bail.

2391
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,470
You got to know when to bail.
Yeah.

2392
01:44:42,670 --> 01:44:43,503
Yup.
Well that's a crazy way to make a 

2393
01:44:44,811 --> 01:44:46,400
living.
Yeah.

2394
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:46,711
Well,
you know,

2395
01:44:46,711 --> 01:44:47,720
on other people to.
Oh,

2396
01:44:47,721 --> 01:44:49,460
I know.
Do you ever watch shark tank?

2397
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:51,890
Sometimes my wife and I've been binge 
watching shark tank.

2398
01:44:52,190 --> 01:44:53,770
The stuff that people come up with,
you know,

2399
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:55,820
I mean it's like some of them are just 
ridiculous,

2400
01:44:55,821 --> 01:44:59,180
but I think it's kind of like American 
idol where they get let those ridiculous

2401
01:44:59,181 --> 01:45:00,014
people on because it's entertaining.
It's half the fun is watching people's 

2402
01:45:02,901 --> 01:45:03,734
preposterous ideas through that.
The other night he had a little of this 

2403
01:45:06,861 --> 01:45:08,930
little chip thing he put over the 
computer,

2404
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,510
um,
the camera so that,

2405
01:45:11,511 --> 01:45:14,970
you know,
the NSA or whoever can't watch you watch

2406
01:45:15,010 --> 01:45:15,340
in it.

2407
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:16,370
And he's like,
okay,

2408
01:45:16,371 --> 01:45:17,230
so here's the thing,
you know,

2409
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:20,210
I'm going to sell it for nine 95 and if 
we get one percent of the market,

2410
01:45:20,211 --> 01:45:20,481
blah,
blah,

2411
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:20,870
blah,
you know,

2412
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:23,960
we're all going to be billionaires.
And then one of the sharks said,

2413
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,790
what?
You just put a piece of tape over there.

2414
01:45:25,791 --> 01:45:26,624
I,
I think I saw mark Zuckerberg put a 

2415
01:45:27,831 --> 01:45:30,740
piece of duck tape on his,
over the camera.

2416
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:35,210
Oh yeah.
You know,

2417
01:45:35,230 --> 01:45:38,120
or,
or somebody else said it'd be fun if you

2418
01:45:38,121 --> 01:45:41,390
had a little thing he put over it.
And there was an image on the inside,

2419
01:45:41,391 --> 01:45:42,820
it was like this,
you know something.

2420
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:43,670
Imagine that the type

2421
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,513
cyber person that would have to be 
sitting around all day waiting for you 

2422
01:45:46,461 --> 01:45:48,830
to turn your laptop camera on.
Come on,

2423
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:49,753
let me see what you're doing.
And they must have algorithms that just 

2424
01:45:52,881 --> 01:45:55,110
look and scan and try to find it.
I don't know.

2425
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:59,090
I could only imagine what's up and stuff
that came out over the weekend.

2426
01:45:59,130 --> 01:45:59,963
I will tell you about that.
Snowden was really leading the sound of 

2427
01:46:01,731 --> 01:46:02,450
your,
oh,

2428
01:46:02,450 --> 01:46:05,210
the Nsa knows who you are,
just by the sound of your voice.

2429
01:46:05,211 --> 01:46:09,740
And their tech predates apple and Amazon
or report on the intercept,

2430
01:46:09,741 --> 01:46:13,160
citing documents leaked by former NSA 
contractor,

2431
01:46:13,161 --> 01:46:13,994
Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA has
highly refined [inaudible] voice 

2432
01:46:17,961 --> 01:46:18,794
recognition software.
The agency's technology dates back more 

2433
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:25,850
than a decade and was instrumental in 
helping to identify Saddam Hussein after

2434
01:46:25,851 --> 01:46:27,800
the invasion of Iraq.
The reports dated,

2435
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:29,413
uh,
your voice were just in the room with 

2436
01:46:30,921 --> 01:46:32,610
your laptop,
or you mean on the phone?

2437
01:46:32,611 --> 01:46:33,444
Supposedly it can now.
They can use almost any microphone 

2438
01:46:35,451 --> 01:46:39,890
that's connected to the Internet.
Every letter in your voice,

2439
01:46:39,891 --> 01:46:40,724
they're the recognition they have is 
better than a face print or a 

2440
01:46:43,041 --> 01:46:43,874
fingerprint.
So if they wanted to find young Jamie 

2441
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:48,110
that could get you or laptop already 
have it.

2442
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:49,303
Wow.
This is saying or you have had it and 

2443
01:46:52,350 --> 01:46:53,880
don't worry about it.
Like there's almost nothing you can.

2444
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:58,940
What is your thoughts on snowden and 
then who's the other guy?

2445
01:47:02,110 --> 01:47:04,900
I have A.
I have a bad feeling about Julia.

2446
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:08,940
Jay have a good feeling about snowden.
Do you have everybody had a good feeling

2447
01:47:08,941 --> 01:47:10,140
about a sausage?
Yeah.

2448
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,160
Trump got into office.
No,

2449
01:47:12,161 --> 01:47:13,920
no.
The stuff before that,

2450
01:47:13,921 --> 01:47:14,754
I didn't care for him,
but I saw a snowden made an appearance 

2451
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:20,100
at Ted was the last 10 I went to in 
Vancouver.

2452
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:24,960
Then they rolled them out on a computer,
big screen and there he was in Russia or

2453
01:47:24,961 --> 01:47:25,794
somewhere.
Right.

2454
01:47:25,990 --> 01:47:30,990
But the points he made were similar to 
that of Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon

2455
01:47:31,681 --> 01:47:32,514
papers.
It's like we should know what our 

2456
01:47:33,541 --> 01:47:35,820
government is doing.
We don't have to know everything.

2457
01:47:35,821 --> 01:47:38,040
You don't have to share the nuclear 
codes with uni,

2458
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:39,820
but you know,
at some point,

2459
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:42,240
you know,
there's some line there how much freedom

2460
01:47:42,241 --> 01:47:44,190
versus security and,
and uh,

2461
01:47:44,191 --> 01:47:45,720
you know,
there's too much stuff going on.

2462
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:49,440
Even in the Obama administration,
that administration of transparency,

2463
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:51,510
this is when a lot of this stuff was 
happening and say,

2464
01:47:51,511 --> 01:47:52,344
wait a minute.
I thought it was Bush that was doing 

2465
01:47:53,611 --> 01:47:56,070
this kind of stuff,
but when we have to remember that Edward

2466
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:58,170
Snowden went into hiding during the 
Obama administration,

2467
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:00,630
one of the worst administrations ever on
record for,

2468
01:48:00,631 --> 01:48:02,030
with whistleblowers.
Right.

2469
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:05,460
Which is really crazy because if you go 
look at the hope and change website when

2470
01:48:05,461 --> 01:48:06,294
it initially existed,
one of the big promises was protection 

2471
01:48:10,621 --> 01:48:15,621
for whistleblowers exposing illegal 
activity and that's just not true yet.

2472
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:17,700
I think he should be allowed to come 
back.

2473
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:19,650
Yes.
He doesn't have to be.

2474
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,220
Worship is a hero.
It's just like this.

2475
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,500
He said brave person before him.
We didn't know we were talking about any

2476
01:48:25,501 --> 01:48:27,000
of this stuff.
I didn't know about this stuff.

2477
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:28,073
While there was some,
there was an NSA contractor from many 

2478
01:48:32,490 --> 01:48:35,460
years ago who brought this stuff up and 
he was sort of dismissed.

2479
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:36,923
What is his name?
He was the original NSA contractor that 

2480
01:48:39,661 --> 01:48:42,570
brought this up,
I want to say in 2011.

2481
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:45,900
Um,
probably could see him in my mind.

2482
01:48:45,901 --> 01:48:48,030
I can't remember his name.
That's it.

2483
01:48:48,090 --> 01:48:48,923
Bill Binney.
I'm not sure who that pull that pull 

2484
01:48:50,261 --> 01:48:53,610
that guy out.
Young Jamie I just read was the original

2485
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:54,421
guy.
Bill Benny,

2486
01:48:54,421 --> 01:48:55,254
the original NSA whistleblower on 
snowden nine slash 11 and illegal 

2487
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:58,950
surveillance.
This was,

2488
01:48:59,130 --> 01:49:04,130
he became incredibly concerned post nine
slash 11 when they started,

2489
01:49:05,481 --> 01:49:06,314
uh,
doing a lot of this in the initial work 

2490
01:49:08,881 --> 01:49:11,730
on computer surveillance and all this 
stuff they were doing.

2491
01:49:11,731 --> 01:49:12,564
And he bailed and interesting.
And you started talking about it openly 

2492
01:49:15,271 --> 01:49:18,780
and publicly.
And then snowden came out after that.

2493
01:49:18,830 --> 01:49:19,663
And the snowden thing was where people 
got all [inaudible] look what we're 

2494
01:49:23,290 --> 01:49:25,230
really got a chance to understand,
oh,

2495
01:49:25,231 --> 01:49:27,780
this is actually happening right now.
This is a real thing,

2496
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:28,673
right?

2497
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:31,290
Yeah.
I do think the government does overreach

2498
01:49:31,291 --> 01:49:33,970
with their security theater.
You know,

2499
01:49:33,971 --> 01:49:37,800
we're at orange level today,
remember that believable.

2500
01:49:37,801 --> 01:49:39,630
It doesn't happen anymore.
What happened to that?

2501
01:49:39,631 --> 01:49:43,080
And yet the number of Americans that die
from foreign terrorism.

2502
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:44,610
I mean,
there are some of the domestic terrorist

2503
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:48,160
if you want to consider mass public 
shootings in that category,

2504
01:49:48,161 --> 01:49:50,800
but foreign terrorists coming here to 
kill Americans.

2505
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:52,270
Uh,
uh,

2506
01:49:52,271 --> 01:49:52,820
I mean,
what,

2507
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:53,221
what is,
is,

2508
01:49:53,221 --> 01:49:54,054
is less than bathtub.
Drownings are weightless and they like 

2509
01:49:56,110 --> 01:49:58,150
lightning struck double lightening 
strikes or something.

2510
01:49:58,151 --> 01:49:58,930
I mean,
it's just nothing.

2511
01:49:58,930 --> 01:50:00,250
It's like shark attacks.
Yeah.

2512
01:50:00,330 --> 01:50:01,163
Alright.
It's just why are we spending billions 

2513
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:05,540
and billions of dollars on this?
It's because they put.

2514
01:50:05,570 --> 01:50:06,910
That was.
They could,

2515
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:07,350
yeah.
Yeah.

2516
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:08,183
It's like,
it's like the proverbial elephant 

2517
01:50:09,491 --> 01:50:11,700
repellent you'd ever.
Since we put the repellent here,

2518
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:13,710
not a single elephant is going to end.
Oh yeah.

2519
01:50:14,010 --> 01:50:14,741
Okay.
Well,

2520
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:16,150
Michael Sherman,
we're Americans.

2521
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:17,860
We don't want to get caught with our 
pants down.

2522
01:50:18,370 --> 01:50:20,020
I understand.
And you know,

2523
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:23,200
it's there.
I just read Daniel Ellsberg's new book,

2524
01:50:23,201 --> 01:50:26,160
the Doomsday Machine.
This is on nuclear deterrence.

2525
01:50:26,161 --> 01:50:28,700
He's against nuclear.
He thinks nuclear deterrence as a,

2526
01:50:28,830 --> 01:50:29,663
as a rational strategy is,
is a longterm mistake because of the 

2527
01:50:32,381 --> 01:50:35,020
possibilities of error,
which,

2528
01:50:35,021 --> 01:50:35,920
you know,
it's all good points,

2529
01:50:35,921 --> 01:50:36,754
but he has,
I'm not sure why it took so long to 

2530
01:50:38,410 --> 01:50:39,243
bring this book out.
He's got his notes when he worked for 

2531
01:50:40,601 --> 01:50:41,434
the State Department in the fifties,
and then the rand corporation in the 

2532
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:44,853
early sixties during the Kennedy 
Administration of the kinds of 

2533
01:50:46,601 --> 01:50:47,434
calculations that go,
our own government was making about how 

2534
01:50:49,421 --> 01:50:52,510
many people we were willing to kill in 
defense,

2535
01:50:52,511 --> 01:50:54,610
you know,
hundreds of millions of Russians just,

2536
01:50:54,611 --> 01:50:55,061
you know,
she was like,

2537
01:50:55,061 --> 01:50:57,070
oh,
it's like the scene from um,

2538
01:50:57,180 --> 01:50:59,380
uh,
Dr strangelove where George C dot Scott,

2539
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:00,520
you know,
he's like,

2540
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,320
I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair 
mussed,

2541
01:51:02,321 --> 01:51:04,270
but 20,
30 million tops.

2542
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:06,443
And that's actually real.
That's the kind of numbers they were 

2543
01:51:08,141 --> 01:51:09,350
throwing out.
Yeah.

2544
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:13,210
You can't leave a human being without 
much responsibility and power.

2545
01:51:13,570 --> 01:51:17,720
And I think that's the bottom line when 
it comes to this NSA surveillance things

2546
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:18,573
that all these government agencies are 
populated by human beings and human 

2547
01:51:22,481 --> 01:51:23,314
beings should not have that kind of 
power over other human beings that are 

2548
01:51:25,571 --> 01:51:27,040
just citizens.
Right?

2549
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:27,903
Because they're just the,
the ability to check all the snowden 

2550
01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:32,043
talked about people being able to check 
in on their exes and read their emails 

2551
01:51:34,991 --> 01:51:37,960
and they were doing things like that.
And this is when Obama was like,

2552
01:51:37,961 --> 01:51:38,470
no,
no,

2553
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:41,470
this is just better data.
It wasn't just metadata,

2554
01:51:41,471 --> 01:51:42,360
man,
whoever.

2555
01:51:42,490 --> 01:51:46,080
They were looking at everything and it,
that's,

2556
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:50,410
that's something we should know about.
And we didn't until snowden and now this

2557
01:51:50,411 --> 01:51:51,820
poor guy has to live in Russia.

2558
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:52,600
Yep.
Nope,

2559
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:54,580
I think he should be brought back for 
sure.

2560
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:55,893
But could he be,
he would have to do something awesome 

2561
01:51:57,041 --> 01:51:59,920
for trump.
Might be after trump.

2562
01:51:59,921 --> 01:52:00,754
I Dunno,
I dunno.

2563
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:04,240
Maybe.
Maybe he jumps out that of all people.

2564
01:52:04,241 --> 01:52:05,740
It's Putin who's protecting it.
It's like,

2565
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:06,970
wait a minute,
what?

2566
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:09,280
I know it's weird.
Well,

2567
01:52:09,281 --> 01:52:10,280
he's probably helping,
but.

2568
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:13,110
But when he makes.
If you watched the Ted Ted talk,

2569
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:14,173
Ted to interview,
Chris Anderson was just talking to them 

2570
01:52:15,941 --> 01:52:18,700
on the stage when from undisclosed 
location in Russia,

2571
01:52:18,701 --> 01:52:22,420
you can't come up totally reasonable.
This is what democracy.

2572
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:24,190
Here's a democracy.
This is what we live in.

2573
01:52:24,710 --> 01:52:28,990
Citizens need to know some things.
Not everything came up totally rational.

2574
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:30,213
He did a great podcast with Neil 
degrasse Tyson and he came off very 

2575
01:52:32,951 --> 01:52:34,120
rational there as well.
Oh,

2576
01:52:34,121 --> 01:52:35,230
I didn't know neal,
uh,

2577
01:52:35,530 --> 01:52:37,780
interview.
Um,

2578
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:40,090
look,
we,

2579
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:42,640
we don't agree to that kind of 
surveillance.

2580
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:44,620
That's,
that's very orwellian.

2581
01:52:44,650 --> 01:52:46,370
It's not what we want,
right?

2582
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:48,740
This is not,
you're not stopping terrorism.

2583
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,300
No.
You just spying on people.

2584
01:52:50,870 --> 01:52:51,703
And also people are rightly concerned 
that anything that they find could be 

2585
01:52:55,311 --> 01:52:56,144
used against you if you are a political 
opponent of theirs or if there's 

2586
01:52:59,511 --> 01:53:02,870
something that you're trying to oppose 
and they go,

2587
01:53:02,871 --> 01:53:03,411
Hey,
well,

2588
01:53:03,411 --> 01:53:04,244
you know,
we found out the year in the cuckold 

2589
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:08,130
porn buddy or whatever it is.
You know,

2590
01:53:08,490 --> 01:53:10,310
it's just,
there's too much tennis stuff.

2591
01:53:10,311 --> 01:53:11,510
Nixon did with the,
um,

2592
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:13,970
with the hoover Jesuit horror and the 
FBI.

2593
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:15,640
Well,
I think whoever did it on his own right,

2594
01:53:15,710 --> 01:53:16,600
he did,
it predicts.

2595
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,880
It was a fascinating character,
you know,

2596
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:20,873
crossdresser as mind freak,
just like spying on everybody just to 

2597
01:53:25,521 --> 01:53:28,220
try to hide his own secrets.
Really amazing.

2598
01:53:28,730 --> 01:53:31,520
But there's an example of one person 
flawed human,

2599
01:53:31,521 --> 01:53:32,354
like everyone else given all this power 
and imagine what hoover would do today 

2600
01:53:36,891 --> 01:53:37,520
with the Internet.

2601
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:38,270
I mean he,
he,

2602
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:39,380
he,
Oh God.

2603
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:42,620
Arguably more flawed than normal human 
beings.

2604
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,633
And I think that goes back to the thing 
that you were talking about with these 

2605
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:46,874
cult leaders.
It's like humans should not have power 

2606
01:53:50,450 --> 01:53:52,040
over other humans,
right?

2607
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:52,933
When they do,
they do terrible things and they abuse 

2608
01:53:56,871 --> 01:54:01,871
that power and they mean it's the 
responsibility that one would have to be

2609
01:54:03,081 --> 01:54:05,360
able to do that.
George C dot Scott thing and say,

2610
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:06,230
God,
20 million,

2611
01:54:06,231 --> 01:54:07,460
30 million,
no big deal.

2612
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,670
It a few people in Chicago,
right?

2613
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:10,573
I mean,
that is,

2614
01:54:11,210 --> 01:54:14,360
that's a crazy thing for a human being 
to have at their fingertips.

2615
01:54:14,361 --> 01:54:15,290
Yep.
Yep.

2616
01:54:15,291 --> 01:54:18,290
And the other problem is bureaucracy,
any large organization,

2617
01:54:18,291 --> 01:54:21,380
but especially bureaucracies,
their tendency is to keep alive.

2618
01:54:21,381 --> 01:54:24,540
We gotta keep our,
keep our jobs and uh,

2619
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:25,383
and,
and the moment you set up a government 

2620
01:54:27,261 --> 01:54:29,900
agencies,
it's really difficult to shut it off.

2621
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:31,333
Yeah,
almost impossible because you have real 

2622
01:54:33,681 --> 01:54:36,560
people with jobs and mortgages and 
families that I get to keep my job,

2623
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:39,920
so we have to justify why we need our 
department and so on.

2624
01:54:39,921 --> 01:54:40,754
And it just always builds that way.
But that is the big issue with big 

2625
01:54:43,131 --> 01:54:45,230
government is it just grows bigger.
It does,

2626
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:46,660
it never shrinks.
They never say,

2627
01:54:46,690 --> 01:54:47,450
Oh,
you know what?

2628
01:54:47,450 --> 01:54:49,440
We don't need the irs.
Right.

2629
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:51,300
This is nonsense.
We just,

2630
01:54:51,710 --> 01:54:52,543
you know,
we realized that if we don't have the 

2631
01:54:53,361 --> 01:54:54,194
irs,
we have to pay so many less people that 

2632
01:54:55,391 --> 01:54:57,400
we can actually get less money in taxes 
from folks.

2633
01:54:57,650 --> 01:54:58,800
Right.
What,

2634
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:00,590
what?
Yeah.

2635
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:01,980
No,
it's A.

2636
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:03,410
Yeah,
it's just a huge problem.

2637
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:05,120
I don't have a good solution to it.
Well,

2638
01:55:05,330 --> 01:55:09,200
it brings me back to the last word of 
the title of your book.

2639
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,750
The scientific search for the afterlife.

2640
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:15,200
Immortality and Utopia.
Utopia.

2641
01:55:15,201 --> 01:55:16,930
Yeah.
Hope is what we're always looking for.

2642
01:55:16,990 --> 01:55:17,541
Yeah,
totally.

2643
01:55:17,541 --> 01:55:19,550
And it doesn't exist.
It can't ever exist.

2644
01:55:19,551 --> 01:55:24,170
Not even in principle because there is 
no right society because we have so much

2645
01:55:24,171 --> 01:55:25,004
variation in our interests and needs and
wants and your abilities and you know 

2646
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:31,040
the idea of programming by fed from the 
top down,

2647
01:55:31,041 --> 01:55:31,874
this is what we're going to do and it's 
going to work or else you're out and 

2648
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:36,513
this.
The problem with utilitarianism is get 

2649
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:38,713
you that utilitarian calculus of the 
greatest good for the greatest number 

2650
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:43,980
and we know what that is and are 
standing

2651
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,650
in our way.
You are preventing utopia,

2652
01:55:46,651 --> 01:55:47,484
so we are going to eliminate you.
You know this is the famous trolley 

2653
01:55:49,531 --> 01:55:50,730
experiment,
a thought experiment.

2654
01:55:50,731 --> 01:55:53,490
You know the trolleys hurdling down the 
tracks about to kill the five workers.

2655
01:55:53,790 --> 01:55:56,220
You're at the switch.
If you throw the switch,

2656
01:55:56,221 --> 01:55:58,530
it'll go down a sidetrack.
It'll kill one worker.

2657
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:01,950
Would you throw the switch?
Skilled the one to save the five,

2658
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:03,623
the five?
We're going to die if you don't do 

2659
01:56:04,081 --> 01:56:07,480
anything.
So we did throw the switch some.

2660
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:08,653
Most people say they would,
that you can go on the website and do 

2661
01:56:10,591 --> 01:56:13,230
this yourself and son who's on track.
Yeah,

2662
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:18,860
it really does.
It's rush limbaugh on this one track she

2663
01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:22,620
imagined and five school kids.
Yeah,

2664
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:25,600
with massive potential for the future.
But uh,

2665
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:28,650
so now most people said they would flip 
the switch,

2666
01:56:28,651 --> 01:56:31,110
but in an interesting twist on that.

2667
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:31,860
So if,
if,

2668
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:36,860
if you're standing on a bridge over the 
track and the train is hurdling down the

2669
01:56:37,291 --> 01:56:38,124
tracks about to kill the five workers 
and standing next to you is a great big 

2670
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:42,330
guy.
Would you hip check him off?

2671
01:56:42,331 --> 01:56:44,180
Boom.
He lands on the tracks.

2672
01:56:44,181 --> 01:56:46,020
SPLAT.
He's killed by the train,

2673
01:56:46,021 --> 01:56:48,240
but it stops it and saves the five 
workers.

2674
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:51,420
Now most people say I got to physically 
grab them and throw them up.

2675
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:51,960
Yeah,
no,

2676
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:53,190
I,
I couldn't do that.

2677
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:54,503
So it's something to do with.
It engages the emotional part of the 

2678
01:56:56,641 --> 01:57:00,870
brain that actively killing somebody is 
way harder than passively killing.

2679
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,390
So if you only have to put,
if you're at a 52 bomber,

2680
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:04,403
35,000 feet up,
you only have to press the button to 

2681
01:57:06,151 --> 01:57:07,640
release the bombs.
Not so

2682
01:57:07,660 --> 01:57:08,493
heart,
but that's even more actively doing it 

2683
01:57:10,541 --> 01:57:12,040
than a drone.
The drone,

2684
01:57:12,041 --> 01:57:15,730
which apparently is a giant issue for 
the drone pilots,

2685
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:20,980
apparently they suffer from really weird
Brill Esd even though they're in Arizona

2686
01:57:20,981 --> 01:57:23,200
doing it in a rack or whatever.
Yeah,

2687
01:57:23,201 --> 01:57:24,450
the nightmares.
I mean,

2688
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:26,110
they're pretty intense.
Interesting.

2689
01:57:26,111 --> 01:57:27,550
I had not,
I hadn't heard that.

2690
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:28,930
Yeah,
I mean,

2691
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:30,753
if you're looking at a screen and you're
seeing someone on the other side of the 

2692
01:57:35,591 --> 01:57:37,260
planet,
you know,

2693
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:38,870
you're in Nevada,
right?

2694
01:57:38,930 --> 01:57:40,640
And some military base,
right?

2695
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:44,410
And you're hitting that button and 
you're watching the screen.

2696
01:57:44,411 --> 01:57:45,720
You're seeing some,
you know,

2697
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:48,600
infrared or black night vision,
right?

2698
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:51,100
This'll slamming into the person that 
you were just observing

2699
01:57:51,370 --> 01:57:52,203
movie about that,
that was like the trolley problem than 

2700
01:57:53,901 --> 01:57:56,700
it was maybe two years ago.
Um,

2701
01:57:56,790 --> 01:57:58,470
where,
um,

2702
01:57:58,950 --> 01:58:01,740
the decision is to be made.
Well,

2703
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:03,313
the setup is we know that the terrorists
and are making a bomb inside this 

2704
01:58:06,631 --> 01:58:09,500
building and we can get a drone there 
to,

2705
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:12,030
to hit it.
And so they're about to do.

2706
01:58:12,031 --> 01:58:14,130
This is toward the beginning of,
they're about to do this.

2707
01:58:14,131 --> 01:58:17,130
And this little girl walks into the 
scene and she's selling bread.

2708
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:18,023
I think it's in Afghanistan or Iraq.
So she's on the corner so she will be 

2709
01:58:20,881 --> 01:58:22,470
killed and it's like,
oh,

2710
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,313
okay,
maybe we could come around from the 

2711
01:58:24,901 --> 01:58:27,390
other side and then she won't be in 
there doing all these calculations.

2712
01:58:27,391 --> 01:58:28,980
But now there's some other people over 
here.

2713
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:33,900
So how many people innocence should we 
kill because we know that the terrorists

2714
01:58:33,901 --> 01:58:36,450
are going to,
if they complete their bomb bomb,

2715
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:39,060
a suicide bomb,
they're going to go to a mall and killed

2716
01:58:39,061 --> 01:58:41,040
300 people or whatever.
So they,

2717
01:58:41,250 --> 01:58:41,640
those,
you know,

2718
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:42,070
how these

2719
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,350
government agencies think about those 
calculations,

2720
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:45,020
you know,
we,

2721
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:45,511
we,
we,

2722
01:58:45,511 --> 01:58:46,344
we got to stop the bad guys,
but how many good people are we willing 

2723
01:58:48,791 --> 01:58:51,100
to kill to prevent them from killing 
even more?

2724
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:54,940
We think maybe if they do this and then 
it gets murky from there.

2725
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:58,130
Well Mike Baker,
who's a former,

2726
01:58:58,131 --> 01:58:58,964
a big wig at the CIA,
have talked to him several times on the 

2727
01:59:01,151 --> 01:59:01,984
podcast.
One of the things that he says that's 

2728
01:59:02,801 --> 01:59:04,390
done by lawyers,
right?

2729
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:05,680
That's right.
That's right.

2730
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:06,543
Because there,
there's,

2731
01:59:07,150 --> 01:59:07,983
there's legal precedence about 
collateral damage that came from the 

2732
01:59:10,871 --> 01:59:13,450
Nuremberg laws and they're,
you know,

2733
01:59:13,451 --> 01:59:15,040
there's some questionable stuff.
We were doing,

2734
01:59:15,041 --> 01:59:17,620
I mean,
I think it's justified second world war,

2735
01:59:17,621 --> 01:59:18,454
but you know,
the mass bombing of Hamburg and 

2736
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:25,640
addressed in this didn't slow the Nazi 
or machine at all,

2737
01:59:26,590 --> 01:59:28,210
but the idea was that,
well,

2738
01:59:28,211 --> 01:59:30,340
the citizens will rise up and kill 
Hitler.

2739
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:31,100
No,
they,

2740
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:32,080
you know,
that you can't.

2741
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:35,170
And in that kind of society you just 
don't have that kind of access or power.

2742
01:59:35,890 --> 01:59:36,760
And uh,
you know,

2743
01:59:36,761 --> 01:59:39,370
this was like when in the first Iraq 
war,

2744
01:59:39,371 --> 01:59:39,970
you know,
we'll,

2745
01:59:39,970 --> 01:59:42,120
we'll stop short,
you know,

2746
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:45,810
Bush senior said we're going to stop 
short and let Saddam's own people taking

2747
01:59:45,811 --> 01:59:46,644
them out and have their own regime 
change and then we'll support the new 

2748
01:59:48,671 --> 01:59:50,260
regime and it just didn't work out that 
way.

2749
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:52,420
So they are,
the calculations get messy.

2750
01:59:52,421 --> 01:59:53,254
I got kind of sidetracked.
The problem with Utopian idea is that 

2751
01:59:55,961 --> 01:59:57,230
utilitarian calculus.
If,

2752
01:59:57,400 --> 02:00:01,030
if most people will agree that it's okay
to kill one to save five,

2753
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,970
why not kill 1 million to save $5 
million?

2754
02:00:04,180 --> 02:00:05,013
That's genocide.
And that is the calculator calculations 

2755
02:00:07,211 --> 02:00:08,044
that genocidal,
mass murderers make know that are our 

2756
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:13,420
German society would be great except for
those Jews,

2757
02:00:13,421 --> 02:00:14,470
you know,
the backstab,

2758
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:18,070
the backstabbers who,
who ruined us in the first world war.

2759
02:00:18,430 --> 02:00:20,800
Now we can just get rid of them.
It's going to be great.

2760
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:24,490
And every genocide is based on that kind
of utilitarian calculus.

2761
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:27,180
However emotional driven it is.
And it's,

2762
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:30,430
it's interesting when you look at the 
numbers from drone attacks,

2763
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:33,040
it's some high,
80,

2764
02:00:33,041 --> 02:00:36,790
90 percent of innocent people are 
killed,

2765
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:38,830
right?
The casualties,

2766
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:42,370
um,
when you look at it in terms of what the

2767
02:00:42,371 --> 02:00:43,204
actual targets that we're looking for 
versus the actual people that were 

2768
02:00:47,321 --> 02:00:48,260
killed,
right?

2769
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:49,143
Collateral damage.
There's a tremendous amount of 

2770
02:00:50,591 --> 02:00:51,424
collateral damage.
And that's not something that we would 

2771
02:00:52,421 --> 02:00:53,254
ever accept from one guy.
Say if we had one guy with a howitzer 

2772
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:57,213
and he just went in there and he says,
blasting women and children to get to 

2773
02:00:59,561 --> 02:01:01,030
the guy that's in the top of the 
building,

2774
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:03,390
there would be no fucking way.
No going back,

2775
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:04,930
I as a murderer,
he's a monster.

2776
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:05,993
But if one guy in Nevada presses a 
button and some hellfire missiles come 

2777
02:01:09,401 --> 02:01:10,234
shooting out of a flying robot and they 
slam into that building and kill 

2778
02:01:13,301 --> 02:01:14,134
everybody,
including this one terrorist that we 

2779
02:01:16,041 --> 02:01:17,490
were after,
except it.

2780
02:01:17,820 --> 02:01:19,750
Right?
So in game theory,

2781
02:01:19,751 --> 02:01:22,690
there's this problem of this sort of 
sliding scale that,

2782
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:23,913
okay,
I know it's like the milgram shock 

2783
02:01:25,031 --> 02:01:27,500
experiment of 15 bolts at a time.
You know,

2784
02:01:27,630 --> 02:01:28,463
before you know it,
you're throwing 450 volts and it is 

2785
02:01:30,221 --> 02:01:31,054
subject.
You couldn't get somebody to do that 

2786
02:01:32,471 --> 02:01:34,450
initially.
But if you do it incrementally,

2787
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:35,460
you know,
the,

2788
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:36,640
the,
the kind of hoping,

2789
02:01:36,641 --> 02:01:39,890
well if I hold out and just do one more,
maybe the end.

2790
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:43,700
And it's like this with these kind of 
utilitarian calculus.

2791
02:01:43,701 --> 02:01:44,534
Okay,
I know I probably shouldn't be doing 

2792
02:01:45,171 --> 02:01:45,750
this,
you know,

2793
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:48,080
these collateral damage or the.
But if we can.

2794
02:01:48,370 --> 02:01:49,203
But if we keep going,
we'll end the war and then that'll stop 

2795
02:01:50,751 --> 02:01:53,930
the other kind of killing.
We do want to stop but it.

2796
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:57,230
But it's always so messy that it takes 
much longer than you think.

2797
02:01:57,231 --> 02:01:59,710
So you can kind of see the logic like,
okay,

2798
02:02:00,430 --> 02:02:02,390
I don't know if you watch Ken Burns' 
documentary series,

2799
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:03,313
the Vietnam War,
but it kind of felt like that the whole 

2800
02:02:04,971 --> 02:02:07,520
time,
like this is when we see at the end,

2801
02:02:07,521 --> 02:02:09,260
it's like God,
this was like a task strappy,

2802
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:11,030
but at every step,
you know,

2803
02:02:11,031 --> 02:02:13,550
Kennedy than Johnson and Nixon is like,
okay,

2804
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:15,100
we can't give up now.
You know,

2805
02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:16,400
the sunk cost fallacy,
you know,

2806
02:02:16,401 --> 02:02:17,234
we put all this in there,
just one more month and then we'll get 

2807
02:02:20,811 --> 02:02:22,670
out and then the month comes like,
okay,

2808
02:02:22,671 --> 02:02:25,700
we're not going to wait another month,
another year.

2809
02:02:25,701 --> 02:02:26,451
And then before,
you know,

2810
02:02:26,451 --> 02:02:29,930
you got 58,000 dead and it's like okay,
this just didn't work.

2811
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:33,470
And I think that happens more often 
because it's always messier.

2812
02:02:33,830 --> 02:02:35,660
Yeah,
that makes sense.

2813
02:02:35,661 --> 02:02:36,494
I mean,
war itself is an incredibly messy 

2814
02:02:38,331 --> 02:02:39,164
business.

2815
02:02:39,540 --> 02:02:40,180
Do you know it's,
it's,

2816
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:41,013
it's outlawed.
It was outlawed in the Paris peace 

2817
02:02:42,781 --> 02:02:44,250
agreements of 19,
27.

2818
02:02:44,490 --> 02:02:45,323
War is illegal.
So a great book called the 

2819
02:02:47,911 --> 02:02:48,744
internationalists.
It gives the history of how this came 

2820
02:02:50,461 --> 02:02:51,294
about and that and the reason for it.
So they gave them the whole history 

2821
02:02:54,991 --> 02:02:55,824
going all the way back to when war 
became legal and it goes all the way 

2822
02:02:57,931 --> 02:02:59,720
back to this,
uh,

2823
02:03:00,210 --> 02:03:02,760
Spanish and Dutch conflict they were 
having.

2824
02:03:02,761 --> 02:03:03,594
And I forget who did what,
but a Spanish ship confiscated a Dutch 

2825
02:03:06,361 --> 02:03:09,330
ship and took all that stuff.
And uh,

2826
02:03:09,331 --> 02:03:12,810
and then there was like a legal battle 
about this and whichever side,

2827
02:03:12,811 --> 02:03:13,920
I think it was,
the Spanish said,

2828
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:14,790
no,
no,

2829
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:16,020
actually,
uh,

2830
02:03:16,030 --> 02:03:18,330
we were,
we were at war and if you're at war,

2831
02:03:18,331 --> 02:03:21,720
it's okay to be a pirate and kill people
and stuff like that.

2832
02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:23,670
And so,
um,

2833
02:03:23,850 --> 02:03:24,683
this Hugo grosses,
legal scholar wrote all this treaties 

2834
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:30,420
that got laid down that said this is 
when war is legal.

2835
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:35,460
It's perfectly okay to kill other people
and take their stuff if you're at war.

2836
02:03:35,490 --> 02:03:37,300
So what does that mean to be a war?
You know,

2837
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:38,850
so then it's legal,
it's all,

2838
02:03:38,851 --> 02:03:40,230
it's all done by lawyers.
Like,

2839
02:03:40,231 --> 02:03:41,520
okay,
this is what it is.

2840
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:44,460
And we have lived with that ever since.
So in the 19,

2841
02:03:44,461 --> 02:03:46,210
27,
the Paris peace or even said,

2842
02:03:46,211 --> 02:03:46,591
okay,
you know,

2843
02:03:46,591 --> 02:03:47,424
we're going to stop that war is illegal 
now obviously this didn't stop Hitler 

2844
02:03:50,041 --> 02:03:50,874
and imperial Japan and so on.
But at least now a leaders have to 

2845
02:03:54,601 --> 02:03:58,590
justify it.
It's like a Bush had to go to the UN and

2846
02:03:58,591 --> 02:04:02,550
get his coalition of the willing.
And that's when Colin Powell to say,

2847
02:04:02,551 --> 02:04:03,384
Oh yes,
we know about the yellow cake and that 

2848
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:08,200
Saddam Hussein wants nuclear weapons it.
I mean,

2849
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:10,260
why would anybody bother with all that 
stuff?

2850
02:04:10,290 --> 02:04:12,640
In the old days they just invade,
you know,

2851
02:04:12,700 --> 02:04:13,411
I came,
I saw,

2852
02:04:13,411 --> 02:04:14,950
I conquered it,
took my stuff,

2853
02:04:15,020 --> 02:04:15,853
and now you have to say I came,
I saw I was just standing there minding 

2854
02:04:17,851 --> 02:04:21,490
my own business and he punched me.
So I invaded in.

2855
02:04:22,290 --> 02:04:23,460
You at least have to do that.

2856
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:27,520
It's sort of like what we were talking 
about earlier that the world today,

2857
02:04:27,550 --> 02:04:28,383
I mean their consciously recognizing 
that there are more rules and that 

2858
02:04:32,471 --> 02:04:33,304
society is a much more complex and safer
place to be and they want to protect 

2859
02:04:37,110 --> 02:04:37,943
that progress in some way.
And that's what the rules of war in 

2860
02:04:40,951 --> 02:04:43,000
comparison to 2000 years ago.
Right?

2861
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:45,200
So that's a good thing.
Yeah.

2862
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:47,580
I mean,
it doesn't stop everybody,

2863
02:04:47,581 --> 02:04:49,020
but even Kim,
John Wooten,

2864
02:04:49,021 --> 02:04:53,880
I kind of have a feeling that maybe I'm 
naive that it's just deterrent for him.

2865
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,910
He wants to take a place at the table 
where he's respected.

2866
02:04:56,911 --> 02:05:00,120
His country is not going to be invaded.
And uh,

2867
02:05:00,121 --> 02:05:00,954
this is sort of a,
a Noam Chomsky argument that I usually 

2868
02:05:03,181 --> 02:05:04,014
make,
but if you look at how America treats 

2869
02:05:06,151 --> 02:05:08,100
other countries,
if they have nukes,

2870
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:09,930
we leave them alone.
If they don't,

2871
02:05:09,931 --> 02:05:11,820
we do whatever we kind of feel like.

2872
02:05:12,110 --> 02:05:12,943
So from his perspective,
it could be those Americans because you 

2873
02:05:15,990 --> 02:05:17,610
see,
they make arguments like this,

2874
02:05:17,611 --> 02:05:19,410
these Americans are evil.
Why?

2875
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:21,590
Look they invaded this country.
They made that they've been in,

2876
02:05:21,591 --> 02:05:24,360
you know,
a dozen wars and just never ending.

2877
02:05:24,390 --> 02:05:27,420
This is who they are.
We're going to get new books and they're

2878
02:05:27,430 --> 02:05:29,490
gonna they're not gonna fuck with this 
ever again.

2879
02:05:29,970 --> 02:05:31,620
And maybe that's,
maybe he'll just stop and go,

2880
02:05:31,621 --> 02:05:32,281
that's it.
Okay.

2881
02:05:32,281 --> 02:05:33,990
You leave me alone.
I'll leave you alone.

2882
02:05:34,050 --> 02:05:36,060
I don't agree with Noam Chomsky on 
everything,

2883
02:05:36,061 --> 02:05:36,894
but I'm,
I'm very happy there's someone like him 

2884
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:44,180
out there who's a brilliant guy that's 
as far left as you can get.

2885
02:05:44,870 --> 02:05:46,950
Yeah.
He's way out there.

2886
02:05:46,951 --> 02:05:51,951
I think it's important to balance these 
intellectual disagreements and you know,

2887
02:05:52,261 --> 02:05:56,290
you need a super smart far left.
He guy wearing a sweater.

2888
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:57,620
Excellent moves.

2889
02:06:02,150 --> 02:06:03,010
Right?
Well,

2890
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:04,173
I agree.
So that's why we have to have free 

2891
02:06:05,581 --> 02:06:09,110
speech and open dialogue and debate with
the guy over here to counter the guy,

2892
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:09,953
you know.
So that's my instead of like 

2893
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:14,190
authoritarian left.
Well why are they there?

2894
02:06:14,191 --> 02:06:15,660
Because there's an authoritarian,
right?

2895
02:06:15,750 --> 02:06:16,583
Yes.
The problem is we expect that from the 

2896
02:06:17,731 --> 02:06:18,564
right.
So this is why we're going through what 

2897
02:06:20,271 --> 02:06:21,930
we're going through now.
It's kind of a surprise.

2898
02:06:21,931 --> 02:06:23,300
Wait a minute.
The liberals are doing this.

2899
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:24,570
Well,
it's fairly recent.

2900
02:06:24,660 --> 02:06:25,493
Yeah.
You know the silencing of people you 

2901
02:06:26,731 --> 02:06:27,564
disagree with and also the really 
disingenuous labeling of people's Nazis 

2902
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:34,433
or a neo Nazis are white supremacist 
just because they simply don't line up 

2903
02:06:37,741 --> 02:06:42,741
with your beliefs of state and it's a 
conscious decision to do that.

2904
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:46,950
It's this isn't like an accidental 
mislabeling,

2905
02:06:46,951 --> 02:06:49,200
we don't really know what the person's 
motives and who they are.

2906
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:50,233
No,
you're just trying to diminish whatever 

2907
02:06:51,331 --> 02:06:52,164
position they have so that your side 
wins and I think a lot of people feel 

2908
02:06:56,491 --> 02:06:57,324
justified by it because of the current 
administration and it just seems like 

2909
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:03,390
we're on a God damn pirate ship now.

2910
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:04,773
I mean,
it seems like when you're seeing what's 

2911
02:07:07,951 --> 02:07:12,350
going on with the erosion of the EPA and
the decision to start drooling,

2912
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:13,213
really,
he made a sweeping decision that you 

2913
02:07:14,941 --> 02:07:16,310
could drill anywhere.
Right?

2914
02:07:16,590 --> 02:07:17,930
Go ahead offshore.
Go ahead.

2915
02:07:18,210 --> 02:07:22,140
Just start drilling that ocean.
The fish oil baby.

2916
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:25,350
Come on,
I'll be in my gold bathroom.

2917
02:07:27,090 --> 02:07:30,450
Giant gold chandelier over the toilet.
Guy Is crazy.

2918
02:07:30,451 --> 02:07:34,320
It's just a strange time.
It's like something out of a movie.

2919
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:37,090
Oh,
it's way crazier than something out of a

2920
02:07:37,091 --> 02:07:37,924
movie.
If there was a president that was this 

2921
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:41,320
nuts in a movie,
you would say,

2922
02:07:41,321 --> 02:07:42,154
that's too over the top.
We played a video yesterday of trump 

2923
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:50,040
that looked at 24 different things that 
trump said he was the best at nobody.

2924
02:07:50,410 --> 02:07:53,050
Nobody.
Nobody loves women more than I do.

2925
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:55,560
Nobody loves Mexicans more than I do and
nobody.

2926
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:57,753
Nobody's better at foreign policy than 
trump uses himself in the third person 

2927
02:08:02,430 --> 02:08:03,263
who saw like oprah as a president,
can we just have like professional 

2928
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:11,260
experts that work in this area that know
what they're doing,

2929
02:08:11,560 --> 02:08:13,180
even if they're not celebrities?

2930
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:13,551
Well,
I'm,

2931
02:08:13,551 --> 02:08:18,551
I'm a firm believer that that position 
is almost always abused and that will,

2932
02:08:19,381 --> 02:08:20,214
we really need instead of like one 
person is like a council of why the 

2933
02:08:24,850 --> 02:08:29,850
tribunal or something like that.
18 super smart people that have to write

2934
02:08:30,851 --> 02:08:34,780
papers on all these different decisions 
that they make and I'd be happy with it.

2935
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:37,030
With the tribe instead of a president,
you have three people,

2936
02:08:37,110 --> 02:08:40,060
you elect him and then for anything to 
happen to it,

2937
02:08:40,061 --> 02:08:43,720
the three have to agree,
but even three because the FCC,

2938
02:08:43,810 --> 02:08:44,643
they.
They took out net and it was only five 

2939
02:08:47,741 --> 02:08:50,020
people.
Five unelected people.

2940
02:08:50,021 --> 02:08:50,831
That's a good point.
Yeah.

2941
02:08:50,831 --> 02:08:51,550
Maybe.
Yeah.

2942
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:52,600
Maybe 18.
Yeah.

2943
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:55,840
Yeah,
I don't.

2944
02:08:56,170 --> 02:08:57,810
Well,
you need an odd number so you don't have

2945
02:08:58,170 --> 02:09:00,100
a tie breaker.
Yeah.

2946
02:09:00,101 --> 02:09:04,360
We had Jessica Rosenworcel,
his last name from the FCC,

2947
02:09:04,361 --> 02:09:08,440
she was one of the five that voted for 
net neutrality.

2948
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:11,890
She wanted to keep it in place and she 
was on two weeks ago,

2949
02:09:12,070 --> 02:09:12,903
something like that.
And describing to us like what the 

2950
02:09:15,701 --> 02:09:16,534
situation is like and how there's only 
five people and they're not elected and 

2951
02:09:20,261 --> 02:09:22,600
they get to decide how,
how did they get that?

2952
02:09:22,740 --> 02:09:24,760
They're appointed,
appointed by the president.

2953
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:26,073
Um,
I don't know if they're appointed by 

2954
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:33,000
trump or maybe they are holdovers from 
apparently easy to stack.

2955
02:09:34,420 --> 02:09:37,630
Is that what she said?
President Obama or trump says,

2956
02:09:37,631 --> 02:09:39,430
uh,
appointed by the president and confirmed

2957
02:09:39,431 --> 02:09:41,710
by the Senate for five year terms.
Okay.

2958
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:43,690
There you go.
So these are new folks then.

2959
02:09:44,180 --> 02:09:45,340
Okay.
Yeah.

2960
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:46,730
And they decided,
no,

2961
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:48,570
let's just give all the money in the 
corporation.

2962
02:09:48,571 --> 02:09:53,571
So instead them just block websites and 
get crazy with throttling in writing.

2963
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:56,920
Right.
It's a weird time for this.

2964
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:58,360
Yes.
Right.

2965
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:02,560
So back to the utopia.
Societies are messy and the only,

2966
02:10:02,830 --> 02:10:06,790
the only Utopian type system would be 
one that there is no system.

2967
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:08,513
You'd have checks,
just nothing but checks and balances 

2968
02:10:09,851 --> 02:10:12,640
because these catch basins of power,
again,

2969
02:10:12,641 --> 02:10:13,474
back to the colts,
they inevitably form and anybody wants 

2970
02:10:16,870 --> 02:10:20,380
more power if they can get it.
It's just human nature,

2971
02:10:20,381 --> 02:10:21,280
right?
It's human nature.

2972
02:10:21,281 --> 02:10:26,170
You it go back to where we're social 
primates bases.

2973
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:28,150
The alpha male is going to,
if he can get there,

2974
02:10:28,151 --> 02:10:28,984
he's going to stay there for as long as 
he can and the Beta males are going to 

2975
02:10:31,091 --> 02:10:36,091
try to under undermine and from out from
underneath this constant struggle.

2976
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:38,570
Again,
there are two kinds of men.

2977
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:43,810
Those would loaded revolvers and those 
who did so well.

2978
02:10:45,801 --> 02:10:47,150
That's why you know this,
again,

2979
02:10:47,270 --> 02:10:48,103
sort of a horizontal bottom up.
Networking systems is one way to try to 

2980
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:55,880
counter the hierarchical power 
structures.

2981
02:10:55,970 --> 02:10:57,500
It's not,
it doesn't always work,

2982
02:10:57,501 --> 02:10:58,334
but now as someone who spends so much 
time looking for actual truth and facts 

2983
02:11:04,041 --> 02:11:04,874
and scientific data,
how concerned are you about the media 

2984
02:11:08,931 --> 02:11:09,380
today?

2985
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:11,870
Because this,
this term fake news,

2986
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:14,083
weird world of,
of attacks on journalism and then even 

2987
02:11:18,981 --> 02:11:23,981
journalism itself falling short and then
journalism in many venues trying to keep

2988
02:11:24,981 --> 02:11:25,814
up with the Internet and putting out 
these salacious click baity headlines 

2989
02:11:29,691 --> 02:11:34,440
even like established media sources or 
doing some sleazy shit now.

2990
02:11:34,670 --> 02:11:36,080
Yeah,
it's a concern for sure.

2991
02:11:36,110 --> 02:11:39,650
We have stay on top of it but,
but there are solutions to this,

2992
02:11:39,651 --> 02:11:40,484
like politifact for example,
where they're not the only site snopes 

2993
02:11:43,281 --> 02:11:48,281
also ranking the factual basis of a 
speech in real time.

2994
02:11:49,190 --> 02:11:50,023
And you can go on like politifact is 
trump's given a speech or during the 

2995
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:55,790
campaign when they were all giving 
speeches and they would rank them,

2996
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:56,400
you know,
from,

2997
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,111
you know,
true.

2998
02:11:57,111 --> 02:11:59,150
Mostly true,
partially false,

2999
02:11:59,151 --> 02:12:00,680
mostly faults,
pants on fire.

3000
02:12:01,470 --> 02:12:03,920
I love their ranking system.
And uh,

3001
02:12:03,921 --> 02:12:04,491
you know,
trump,

3002
02:12:04,491 --> 02:12:06,080
trump got a lot of pants on fire.

3003
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:07,253
Yeah.
Uh,

3004
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:08,263
so at least there's a counter to it.
And now those sites are becoming pretty 

3005
02:12:11,961 --> 02:12:12,950
popular.
Um,

3006
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:15,500
they're kind of a form of clickbait 
themselves.

3007
02:12:15,501 --> 02:12:19,580
Let's go there and find out how many 
times this guy lied in his speech.

3008
02:12:19,581 --> 02:12:20,414
So it would have been nice if we 
would've had that say in the Nixon 

3009
02:12:22,671 --> 02:12:25,760
administration or the Johnson 
administration like the Gulf of Tonkin,

3010
02:12:25,761 --> 02:12:26,850
if this could have been,
you know,

3011
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:28,043
a whistleblower and in called and put 
out there so that we didn't drag 

3012
02:12:31,411 --> 02:12:33,560
yourselves into the Vietnam war even 
deeper.

3013
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:36,230
My thought,
and this is a very,

3014
02:12:36,290 --> 02:12:37,123
a paranoid thought,
is that all this is inevitably opening 

3015
02:12:41,421 --> 02:12:45,170
us up to the truth chip to the mind,
reading the chip.

3016
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:48,140
But if things are going to get so 
chaotic that we're going to say,

3017
02:12:48,141 --> 02:12:49,910
you know what,
just hit me with the chip.

3018
02:12:49,911 --> 02:12:51,970
I can't fucking take this anymore.
I don't know who's right.

3019
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:56,430
Fox News says one thing.
CNN says another slide it in slide.

3020
02:12:56,460 --> 02:12:57,650
I want in my forearm right here.

3021
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:02,330
Yes.
Solution.

3022
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:03,373
It might literally be like nature's way 
of allowing us to slowly accept the 

3023
02:13:08,031 --> 02:13:12,620
symbiotic relationships with this.
This new artificial intelligence.

3024
02:13:13,340 --> 02:13:15,500
I think webster's just this last week 
voted,

3025
02:13:15,501 --> 02:13:16,334
uh,
it was alternative facts is the word of 

3026
02:13:17,661 --> 02:13:21,110
the year phrase of the year for 2017 for
the year before that,

3027
02:13:21,111 --> 02:13:21,944
it was fake.
Fake news with Sean Spicer said 

3028
02:13:23,451 --> 02:13:24,530
alternative facts.
Right.

3029
02:13:24,531 --> 02:13:29,531
It was forced to try to like Kellyanne 
conway after the inaugural.

3030
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:31,170
A,
uh,

3031
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:33,380
size of the audience.
Yeah.

3032
02:13:33,820 --> 02:13:34,653
And,
uh,

3033
02:13:34,730 --> 02:13:35,800
he said,
look at a picture.

3034
02:13:35,830 --> 02:13:38,150
Uh,
it's not as big as a.

3035
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:38,770
well,
that's where.

3036
02:13:38,770 --> 02:13:40,890
Did you get that number?
That was an alternative fact.

3037
02:13:41,350 --> 02:13:42,183
Yeah.
They seem to like keep her locked up 

3038
02:13:43,891 --> 02:13:47,160
more now.
She seems to be less less.

3039
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:49,320
She just keeps stuffing her foot in her 
mouth.

3040
02:13:49,670 --> 02:13:50,401
Yeah.
Well,

3041
02:13:50,401 --> 02:13:54,000
they all have to because the end of the 
boss sends him out to tell them this.

3042
02:13:54,001 --> 02:13:54,360
Okay.

3043
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:59,360
Can you imagine that's poor Sean Spicer 
guy when he talks about it now it's like

3044
02:13:59,461 --> 02:14:01,780
a guy who's just been freed from prison.
Right?

3045
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:03,433
Well,
he's probably making a lot of money on 

3046
02:14:03,991 --> 02:14:05,700
the lecture circuit now.
Oh,

3047
02:14:05,701 --> 02:14:06,960
I can imagine.
Yeah,

3048
02:14:06,961 --> 02:14:08,610
probably.
It's probably a very lucrative,

3049
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:11,420
but if you look at governments,
you know,

3050
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:13,260
centuries past or thousands of years 
ago,

3051
02:14:13,261 --> 02:14:13,681
they,
you know,

3052
02:14:13,681 --> 02:14:16,080
there was lying and corruption and all 
that.

3053
02:14:16,130 --> 02:14:16,880
Oh,
that's,

3054
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:17,840
that's old.
Yeah.

3055
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:21,420
It's just now it's so blatant,
the yellow press.

3056
02:14:21,421 --> 02:14:22,770
I mean,
where did that come from?

3057
02:14:22,771 --> 02:14:23,341
That was,
you know,

3058
02:14:23,341 --> 02:14:24,930
the whoever told.
No,

3059
02:14:24,931 --> 02:14:26,160
it was hearst,
William Randolph.

3060
02:14:26,170 --> 02:14:30,840
First you gave me the war and I'll 
supply you the photographs or whatever.

3061
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:33,780
Yeah.
So you know that that's fake news.

3062
02:14:34,130 --> 02:14:37,410
That's literally affect news.
The sinking of the Maine.

3063
02:14:37,411 --> 02:14:38,560
Let's go to war.
Well,

3064
02:14:38,690 --> 02:14:42,120
you know what actually happened again?
Gulf of Tonkin.

3065
02:14:42,150 --> 02:14:42,983
Gulf of Tonkin.

3066
02:14:43,010 --> 02:14:44,400
Yeah.
That Vietnam War.

3067
02:14:44,401 --> 02:14:46,590
Documentary series.
I just wanted to put my head in the oven

3068
02:14:46,591 --> 02:14:48,260
after that and turn the gas.
I was like,

3069
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:50,700
you know,
this went on for so long,

3070
02:14:50,701 --> 02:14:52,950
so many years.
What did we in Afghanistan,

3071
02:14:52,951 --> 02:14:54,840
I was 16 years now.
Vietnam war.

3072
02:14:54,841 --> 02:14:57,990
It wasn't quite that long,
but if you look back to where it started

3073
02:14:57,991 --> 02:15:00,450
in the fifties when we.
We weren't at war,

3074
02:15:00,451 --> 02:15:02,490
we were sending advisors there,
you know,

3075
02:15:03,390 --> 02:15:05,400
this kind of stuff.
It's just a,

3076
02:15:05,401 --> 02:15:06,234
it's so depressing.
We like to think of our government is 

3077
02:15:08,371 --> 02:15:10,410
having enough checks and balances.
I think we need more.

3078
02:15:10,710 --> 02:15:11,543
I would like to think of our 
civilization as being something that 

3079
02:15:14,821 --> 02:15:15,654
aspires to a higher standard.
Some like something that is more 

3080
02:15:19,291 --> 02:15:20,124
advanced because we've learned from the 
lessons of the thousands of years of 

3081
02:15:22,321 --> 02:15:27,321
written history and we we aspire to a 
greater set of values.

3082
02:15:28,470 --> 02:15:30,180
So one of the things I like about Elon 
Musk's,

3083
02:15:30,210 --> 02:15:33,990
let's go colonize Mars in addition to 
the technological problems.

3084
02:15:34,140 --> 02:15:36,270
How will they set up lift?
There's 100 people.

3085
02:15:36,271 --> 02:15:37,920
There are a thousand,
10,000.

3086
02:15:38,310 --> 02:15:39,780
What kind of government are they going 
to have?

3087
02:15:39,781 --> 02:15:43,140
What kind of me just maniacs and we'll 
do.

3088
02:15:43,141 --> 02:15:43,974
It was so crazy to die on Mars.
It's probably not going to be your 

3089
02:15:47,581 --> 02:15:48,414
average typical a human.
You imagine you're going to take a six 

3090
02:15:53,071 --> 02:15:53,904
month spaceship visit through through 
the cosmos to land on a planet that 

3091
02:15:58,351 --> 02:16:01,260
you're going to die on.
You will never come back coming back,

3092
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:02,513
unless they are so smart.
They figure out a way to build a rocket 

3093
02:16:05,730 --> 02:16:09,060
and shoot back,
which they probably won't know but that.

3094
02:16:09,061 --> 02:16:10,460
But,
so if you went in,

3095
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:13,540
you were advising like what kind of 
government would you set up or you know,

3096
02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:14,423
sort of social organization to prevent 
people from stealing other people's 

3097
02:16:17,431 --> 02:16:22,431
stuff that we got to work cooperatively 
to plant a potato things and question,

3098
02:16:23,370 --> 02:16:24,930
how do you do that?
You know,

3099
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:26,940
we have thousands of years of 
experiments,

3100
02:16:26,941 --> 02:16:27,774
but you know,
it's,

3101
02:16:27,990 --> 02:16:29,650
they're all messy.
Yeah.

3102
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,030
No one's ever done it.
Right.

3103
02:16:31,031 --> 02:16:33,250
Which is again,
the utopian.

3104
02:16:33,251 --> 02:16:33,960
Yeah,
I mean,

3105
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:35,150
is it different to have,
you know,

3106
02:16:35,230 --> 02:16:36,520
10 people,
100 people,

3107
02:16:36,521 --> 02:16:37,680
1000,
10,000,

3108
02:16:37,681 --> 02:16:38,514
you know,
there's a scaling effect where it 

3109
02:16:40,961 --> 02:16:42,790
becomes more efficient the more people 
you have.

3110
02:16:42,791 --> 02:16:44,560
But on the other hand,
then you get these power,

3111
02:16:44,770 --> 02:16:45,603
you know,
catch basins of power that grow and 

3112
02:16:46,961 --> 02:16:49,600
become corrupt.
That's gotTa happen on Mars.

3113
02:16:49,690 --> 02:16:50,523
It's going to happen.
And also the community gets fractured 

3114
02:16:52,151 --> 02:16:55,060
because you don't know these people 
anymore and you get 5,000 people.

3115
02:16:55,061 --> 02:16:56,770
There's no way you can know 5,000 
people,

3116
02:16:57,120 --> 02:16:58,230
$500.
Right?

3117
02:16:58,270 --> 02:16:59,320
There's Mike.
Hey Mike.

3118
02:16:59,370 --> 02:17:00,720
Yeah,
that's right sally.

3119
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:03,580
You know those people,
you get 5,000.

3120
02:17:03,581 --> 02:17:05,470
You're like,
who's that guy just flew here?

3121
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:06,830
He's from Chicago,
now,

3122
02:17:06,831 --> 02:17:09,430
those on Mars,
but you know,

3123
02:17:09,431 --> 02:17:12,460
even small hunter gatherer groups,
they have conflicts all the time.

3124
02:17:12,670 --> 02:17:16,990
They get to sit down in the dirt area in
the Commons ground and talk about it.

3125
02:17:17,350 --> 02:17:20,980
And then you stole this pig and the pig 
died and now you alma pig.

3126
02:17:21,010 --> 02:17:22,010
Okay,
go get your pick.

3127
02:17:22,011 --> 02:17:22,990
Okay,
we're going to settle it.

3128
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:25,500
But what happens when someone dies?
You know,

3129
02:17:25,510 --> 02:17:26,021
it's like,
okay,

3130
02:17:26,021 --> 02:17:27,410
you owe 10 pigs.
You know,

3131
02:17:27,470 --> 02:17:29,650
they,
they had these calculations like this is

3132
02:17:29,710 --> 02:17:32,710
the equivalent of a life is 10 pigs and 
uh,

3133
02:17:32,890 --> 02:17:35,740
that's going to happen no matter what 
planet we're living on.

3134
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:41,020
Did you get any personal insight?
I'm sure you do have to.

3135
02:17:41,021 --> 02:17:43,540
Every book you read,
you read or you write rather.

3136
02:17:43,870 --> 02:17:46,890
But did you get any unique personal 
insight into this?

3137
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:47,733
I did at the last chapter is on what 
does it mean to live a fulfilling on 

3138
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:53,860
inspiring happiness,
a fulfilled life?

3139
02:17:54,070 --> 02:17:55,620
If there's no afterlife,
there is no god,

3140
02:17:55,660 --> 02:17:56,950
whatever.
Or even if there is,

3141
02:17:56,951 --> 02:17:57,581
it doesn't.
Again,

3142
02:17:57,581 --> 02:17:59,320
it doesn't really matter because we live
in this world,

3143
02:17:59,860 --> 02:18:04,240
so it turns out there's research that 
shows that striving for happiness is the

3144
02:18:04,241 --> 02:18:05,560
wrong metric.

3145
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:08,890
That's the wrong goal,
that striving to live a purposeful,

3146
02:18:08,891 --> 02:18:09,724
meaningful life is what we should be 
after and that often entails doing 

3147
02:18:12,851 --> 02:18:14,800
things that don't make you happy.
They're not fun,

3148
02:18:14,801 --> 02:18:17,470
they're not pleasurable.
So like for example,

3149
02:18:17,471 --> 02:18:18,460
when you work out,
you know,

3150
02:18:18,461 --> 02:18:21,880
it's not fun and in a sense of like a 
morphine drip,

3151
02:18:21,881 --> 02:18:23,350
you know,
I'm getting a lot of pleasure from this.

3152
02:18:23,890 --> 02:18:24,723
Afterwards,
you get a sense of endorphins and you 

3153
02:18:26,741 --> 02:18:29,290
feel better about yourself.
Um,

3154
02:18:29,410 --> 02:18:30,243
and so like there's research showing 
that if you go out for drinks with your 

3155
02:18:33,731 --> 02:18:35,740
friends to enter and so on,
that's fun.

3156
02:18:35,741 --> 02:18:37,210
It's pleasurable,
but it's short term.

3157
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:40,450
A caretaking for a parent,
for example.

3158
02:18:40,451 --> 02:18:43,240
This shows that this is not fun at all.
I've done this.

3159
02:18:43,420 --> 02:18:47,080
Two of my four parents,
I had step parents and this was not fun.

3160
02:18:47,081 --> 02:18:48,760
It wasn't pleasurable.
I didn't enjoy it,

3161
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:49,753
you know,
schlepping my dad around to doctors and 

3162
02:18:50,861 --> 02:18:53,650
hospitals and you know,
I was just drained by the end of the day

3163
02:18:53,651 --> 02:18:55,840
doing this,
but I felt better about myself.

3164
02:18:56,290 --> 02:18:58,420
So it turns out the research shows that,
you know,

3165
02:18:58,510 --> 02:19:01,600
if you have more longterm goals both 
forward and back,

3166
02:19:01,601 --> 02:19:04,180
forward goals,
back reflecting on your past,

3167
02:19:04,181 --> 02:19:07,630
what you've done,
not oriented toward being happy,

3168
02:19:07,631 --> 02:19:08,464
but being,
you know,

3169
02:19:08,530 --> 02:19:10,600
sort of leading a purposeful,
driven life.

3170
02:19:10,990 --> 02:19:13,810
That's what makes people feel better 
about their lives.

3171
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:16,660
And really that's all we can do.
And it's enough.

3172
02:19:16,690 --> 02:19:21,100
It's enough to sort of feel like my life
was well worth living.

3173
02:19:21,130 --> 02:19:24,510
It's worth getting up in the morning 
without the promise of an afterlife.

3174
02:19:24,550 --> 02:19:27,380
You don't need that just like this life.
I can make a difference.

3175
02:19:27,381 --> 02:19:28,214
I can get up this morning,
do something that I may not enjoy it 

3176
02:19:30,890 --> 02:19:31,980
quite so much,
but you know,

3177
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,250
working out,
you know,

3178
02:19:33,251 --> 02:19:34,850
like I do my three hour bike ride,
you know,

3179
02:19:34,851 --> 02:19:37,340
it's so good to get up at.
I got to get up at 6:30 in the morning.

3180
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:39,050
They roll out at seven.
It's cold,

3181
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:40,573
partially dark,
it's like I got to bundle up and then 

3182
02:19:42,201 --> 02:19:43,034
they gotta strip close off as I go,
so I have to figure this all out and 

3183
02:19:45,811 --> 02:19:47,750
it's not fun.
But you know,

3184
02:19:47,751 --> 02:19:48,800
after,
after the ride I'm like,

3185
02:19:49,060 --> 02:19:51,970
I really feel great that I did this and 
yeah,

3186
02:19:52,810 --> 02:19:54,980
I had fun with my buddies,
but it's not fun.

3187
02:19:54,981 --> 02:19:56,010
Like,
you know,

3188
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:58,010
I had a drink with my friends and that 
was fun.

3189
02:19:58,011 --> 02:19:59,960
That's a different kind of fun.
So.

3190
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:03,200
And that funds okay,
two times balance,

3191
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:05,370
but it shouldn't all be the fun,
right?

3192
02:20:05,790 --> 02:20:07,760
Yeah,
I mean they're full meaningful,

3193
02:20:07,761 --> 02:20:09,290
right.
There are people that do that.

3194
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:14,000
So I talk about Diana Niad who I knew 
back in the 19 eighties when I was doing

3195
02:20:14,001 --> 02:20:14,834
race across America,
the transplant on a bike race and Diana 

3196
02:20:16,940 --> 02:20:19,200
worked for why we're live sports and 
they covered the race.

3197
02:20:19,240 --> 02:20:20,073
I would talk to her a lot.
She's in the back of the truck with the 

3198
02:20:21,401 --> 02:20:23,610
camera crew.
I'm riding along and uh,

3199
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:25,820
she's a really interesting person.
She's an atheist,

3200
02:20:26,330 --> 02:20:27,920
you know,
she did the Cuba to Florida swim.

3201
02:20:27,921 --> 02:20:28,754
She's an ultra marathon swimmer and uh,
she failed to make it back in her 

3202
02:20:32,061 --> 02:20:32,894
twenties and she came back when she 
turned 60 and said I'm going to go for 

3203
02:20:34,971 --> 02:20:36,620
this again.
And uh,

3204
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:39,200
it took her four years and I think for 
tries to do it,

3205
02:20:39,201 --> 02:20:40,034
but she did it.
So she appears on Oprah's super soul 

3206
02:20:42,591 --> 02:20:47,591
Sunday show she had for awhile and um,
and Oprah's asking her will,

3207
02:20:48,230 --> 02:20:50,500
how do you find on and you know,
and meaning,

3208
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:51,920
you know,
what do you believe?

3209
02:20:51,921 --> 02:20:55,350
Well,
I'm an atheist and she described how,

3210
02:20:55,380 --> 02:20:56,213
how are awestruck she is about the 
universe and life and what science has 

3211
02:20:59,211 --> 02:20:59,600
told us.

3212
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:01,100
And Solomon,
Oprah says something like,

3213
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:03,620
well,
I don't see how you can be an atheist if

3214
02:21:03,621 --> 02:21:05,320
you're in,
if you're on inspired.

3215
02:21:05,350 --> 02:21:06,650
And then she says,
I,

3216
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:08,510
I don't see why those are in 
contradiction.

3217
02:21:09,020 --> 02:21:09,570
I mean,
the whole,

3218
02:21:09,570 --> 02:21:10,403
you know,
living a meaningful life and being 

3219
02:21:11,601 --> 02:21:15,200
engaged in the world and other people 
that is spiritual,

3220
02:21:15,201 --> 02:21:16,900
that is inspiring,
that you know,

3221
02:21:16,910 --> 02:21:17,743
you don't need God for that.
And it was sort of an interesting 

3222
02:21:19,581 --> 02:21:23,900
exchange because Uber's was reflecting 
kind of a common theme that people have.

3223
02:21:23,901 --> 02:21:26,840
You need God to have a meaningful life.
And Diana's whole point was,

3224
02:21:26,841 --> 02:21:27,674
no,
you don't.

3225
02:21:27,890 --> 02:21:31,100
You just have to be engaged with the 
world in some meaningful way.

3226
02:21:31,190 --> 02:21:33,440
And that's enough.
And on that note,

3227
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:37,490
Michael Shermer,
heavens on earth,

3228
02:21:37,790 --> 02:21:38,623
the scientific search for the afterlife,
immortality and Utopia available now on 

3229
02:21:42,951 --> 02:21:44,690
Amazon and everywhere else.
Thanks.

3230
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:45,770
Thank you brother.
Appreciate it,

3231
02:21:45,771 --> 02:21:46,604
man.
