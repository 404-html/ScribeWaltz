1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,870
Oh sweet baby.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,440
Jesus.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,220
Here we go.

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:05,580
We are,

5
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,960
we actually laugh so you that
I can hear my own laptop.

6
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:12,300
So I know it's live now.

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,410
It's a feature I trust,

8
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,131
not even myself.

9
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:17,000
Now it's a feature if fucked it up so
many times I've decided to strengthen

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,250
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by tank.

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,070
If you go to ting.com forward slash no,

12
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:28,904
that's the wrong one.

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,430
rogan.ting.com is the update URL,

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,230
rogan.ting.com.

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:34,950
Uh,

16
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,030
if you go there,

17
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:36,620
you will,

18
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,100
you will check out what
[inaudible] is all about.

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,160
It's a,

20
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:39,840
uh,

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,460
an ethical cell phone company.

22
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,670
They are selling you the
very best mobile devices.

23
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,180
Uh,

24
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,470
on the android platform.

25
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,660
They have the Samsung Galaxy as two.

26
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:49,494
They have the,

27
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,290
the galaxy note to the s three,

28
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,071
the galaxy s three.

29
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:55,920
They have all of the
high end android phones,

30
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,480
which are pretty bad ass.

31
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,640
I have a that Samsung Galaxy s three.

32
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:01,980
It's a magnificent piece of equipment.

33
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:02,610
Um,

34
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,181
so you're,

35
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:04,260
you're not like a,

36
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:07,290
you're not going to be starved for
technology dealing with cheaper prices.

37
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:12,291
And in dealing with a no
contract situation and instead
what they do is provide

38
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:12,751
you,

39
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:13,290
um,

40
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,990
cell phone service on the
sprint back where a backbone.

41
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,670
So you know,

42
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,420
dealing with like some mom and
pop a cell phone distributor.

43
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:23,100
It's an excellent cell phone network.

44
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:23,881
The sprint network,

45
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:25,050
one of the biggest ones in the country,

46
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,220
no contracts,

47
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,320
uh,

48
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,681
no,

49
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:28,590
no ETFs,

50
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,570
no bundling a ride along services,

51
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:31,830
no overage charges.

52
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:33,660
If you use more than
they thought you would,

53
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,250
you just pay for whatever you used.

54
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,770
You'll also get credits
on the unused service,

55
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:38,130
which is,

56
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,240
I love this.

57
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,430
If you use less than
you thought you would,

58
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:44,760
tink drops you down to the
level you hit and credits you.

59
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,960
The difference on your next bill.

60
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:48,900
I mean that's like a sweet as you
can get with a big corporation.

61
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,830
I love it.

62
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,030
And everyone can do this.

63
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,630
You know,

64
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:51,901
this,

65
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:52,680
this doesn't,

66
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,140
it doesn't have to be just one
company that functions like this.

67
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,790
There's plenty of money to be made.

68
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,920
You just don't have to be
a total douchebag about it.

69
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,993
And that's the,

70
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
that's the philosophy behind tank
and that's why we support them.

71
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,230
If you go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible]
dot com you can save 25 bucks off of

72
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,100
either services or phone from a,

73
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:11,280
a really bad ass company.

74
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,200
Go Dana white phones here,

75
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,030
like the refurbished three 70 votes.

76
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,280
He loves a little flip phone.

77
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,160
He texts really quick with his thumb.

78
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:20,940
I don't get it.

79
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,280
I don't know why he would even
be interested in trying that,

80
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,121
but uh,

81
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:24,690
that's his,

82
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,523
that's his move.

83
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,060
Um,

84
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,750
so go check it out.

85
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,190
We're also brought to you by Squarespace.

86
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,180
Squarespace is one of our newest
sponsors and what Squarespace is.

87
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:36,300
If you go to squarespace.com
forward slash Joe,

88
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,021
you can,

89
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:37,500
uh,

90
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,910
check out what they have to offer,

91
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,361
what it,

92
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:44,361
what it is is a website that's set
up so the lay person can divide,

93
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,730
can design and build a website.

94
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,860
The way it's set up,

95
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,300
all the templates are very intuitive and
they have a bunch of different examples

96
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:57,300
that you can say of what your website
could look like if you try it this way or

97
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:57,930
that way.

98
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,350
And it allows you to do,

99
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:02,890
which wasn't really possible
just a few years ago.

100
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,940
A few years ago,

101
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,860
you had to like hire a guy.

102
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:06,970
I knew html,

103
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,181
you know,

104
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:11,200
you had to learn how to use a
different software packages.

105
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,420
A dream weaver was one of them,

106
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:14,254
right?

107
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,103
Yeah.

108
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,950
There was all these different really
complicated programs to learn how to not

109
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,501
complicate it.

110
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:20,920
For me,

111
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,760
if you're a web designer,

112
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:21,971
you're like,

113
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,241
dude,

114
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:22,601
it's fun.

115
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,140
Clone Bakunin and I could show you it.

116
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:24,711
Shoe Mofo,

117
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:25,960
Robin Hood does learning code.

118
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:26,690
Nope.

119
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,070
Pad and html.

120
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,180
That's all I used.

121
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,460
Do you actually built
them back in the Disney,

122
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:31,721
right?

123
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:31,761
Yeah.

124
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:33,380
I still like prefer that.

125
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,670
I would just go in and just put some,

126
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:35,780
a harass in there.

127
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:36,860
And so why do you like,

128
00:03:36,861 --> 00:03:37,271
do you like it?

129
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:37,400
Yeah,

130
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,510
for the satisfaction.

131
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:38,931
It's just like,

132
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:40,070
it's kind of fun to do it that way.

133
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:40,660
It's just,

134
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:40,960
it's,

135
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,130
I just don't think it's that hard.

136
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:43,270
It's pretty easy to do.

137
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:43,810
Yeah.

138
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,860
But you went to school for that?

139
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,120
Yeah.

140
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,750
But it was when I took the
first class at my college,

141
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,570
the first class they ever had on internet,

142
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,930
it was called multimedia
production and design.

143
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,130
And it was the first time they're like,

144
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:57,281
well,

145
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:58,570
this new Internet shit,

146
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,651
it's catching on.

147
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,360
So we'd better start having some classes,

148
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:01,691
you know,

149
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:02,471
about the Internet,

150
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:02,711
you know,

151
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,670
designing for the Internet.

152
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,740
And I took the first
class of the first year,

153
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,990
it was like so stupid.

154
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:08,680
They had no idea.

155
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,270
The teachers didn't
know how to do anything.

156
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:10,481
You know,

157
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:10,961
they were like,

158
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:11,210
we're,

159
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,540
we just learned about this
to this internet stuff.

160
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,960
Teachers who've been teaching for 20
years possibly teach you about the

161
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:17,770
internet.

162
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,640
They pretty much just like,

163
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:18,851
well,

164
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:20,560
there's this thing called flash.

165
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:20,890
Uh,

166
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,040
it's from Macromedia and uh,

167
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,790
it's on version one.

168
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,110
We should probably look into that.

169
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:29,590
And so you must be able to really
appreciate something like Squarespace.

170
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:30,970
The fact that they make it so easy,

171
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:31,960
everything's easy now.

172
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:32,650
I wish,

173
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,670
I wish I enjoy it because I
actually hate doing websites now.

174
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,140
It's just because like for other people
it's the worst thing ever to do because

175
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:42,940
like you'll design this whole
website and they're like,

176
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,271
ah,

177
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:43,481
you know,

178
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,470
I don't like the purple.

179
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,550
And then so that means you have to like
change every single little table and

180
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:48,820
stuff.

181
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,960
So the cool thing about like Squarespace
is that you could just put a template,

182
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,811
like if you just have you,

183
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:55,090
if you want a website that's just like,

184
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:55,391
hey,

185
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,080
I have a,

186
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,501
you know,

187
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,970
a store that I want to advertise,

188
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:58,990
a small company,

189
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,910
you could just pretty much get a template,

190
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,180
put it all the information down so
you'll at least have some presence on the

191
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:04,481
Internet.

192
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:05,314
So it makes it easy.

193
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,790
Here's one of the cool
things about Squarespace.

194
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,391
If you go there,

195
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,224
you sign up.

196
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,030
You don't need to enter in a credit card.

197
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,500
All you have to do is just try it out,

198
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,030
start building a website.

199
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:14,930
And then if you decide,

200
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:15,171
okay,

201
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:15,741
I like it,

202
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:16,790
this could be my website,

203
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:16,950
I,

204
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,960
this is a good product.

205
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,360
Then you decided to purchase Squarespace,

206
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,223
Squarespace.

207
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,140
Just use the code Joe to
Joe and the number two.

208
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,990
I Dunno why Joe and
the number two Joe too.

209
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,510
So that's squarespace.com.

210
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:33,050
Forward Slash Joe and the
offer code is one word,

211
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:33,471
Joe.

212
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:34,580
And then number two,

213
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,800
you should do that and get 10%
of their fucking businessman.

214
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,920
It's some wacky Shit Joe to
who's going to remember that?

215
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:42,740
It's Taco Joe.

216
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,250
That's what it needs.

217
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:43,911
It's yeah,

218
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:44,810
it is ridiculous.

219
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,240
They'll say no one's clicking through.

220
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:47,360
I'm probably because no
one can remember that.

221
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,631
Yeah.

222
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:48,980
Cause if they're just
probably going to Joe.

223
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:49,790
Yeah,

224
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,623
either way.

225
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,171
Doesn't matter.

226
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:51,860
It's good company.

227
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,161
Good,

228
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:52,880
good product.

229
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,180
Uh,

230
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,660
and uh,

231
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,171
excellent.

232
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:58,320
If you are looking to design your own
website and it's satisfying to do so,

233
00:05:58,321 --> 00:05:58,831
go check it out.

234
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:02,820
You Dirty Fox were also brought to
you by [inaudible] dot com that's o,

235
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,510
n n,

236
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,081
I t.

237
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:05,420
And if you use the code name of Rogan,

238
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,250
you will save 10% off
any of the supplements.

239
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,360
Um,

240
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,460
people who have heard this podcast before.

241
00:06:11,461 --> 00:06:12,570
You know what on it is?

242
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:13,110
If you don't,

243
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,950
it's essentially a company that sells
all things that make your body better,

244
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,260
whether it's uh,

245
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,230
foods.

246
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,820
We sell a hemp force,

247
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,630
which is a incredibly
nutritious protein powder.

248
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:28,460
It made out of hemp with Maca and cocoa
in it and Dan Carlin's on the podcast.

249
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:32,610
So we can go into the history of why
this hemp is illegal to grow in America,

250
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,750
but yet legal to purchase.

251
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,130
It's non psychoactive.

252
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:35,851
If you have questions,

253
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:38,970
it won't make you a test
positive on a drug test.

254
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:39,781
It's just a,

255
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:41,010
it's just the plant material.

256
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:41,640
No,

257
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:41,910
no,

258
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,950
no drug but excellent for your body.

259
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,080
Super Easy to digest.

260
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:47,430
It also has raw cocoa and Maca in it.

261
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:48,881
And A,

262
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:50,640
we sell a lot of cool
shit like that on it.

263
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,900
We sell coconut oil,

264
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:53,790
we sell micro toxin free coffee,

265
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,280
we sell buffalo jerky bars.

266
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,290
It's all Himalayan sea salt.

267
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,210
I don't know if that's really
supposed to be good for you.

268
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,050
I don't know.

269
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:01,883
It sounds bad ass.

270
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,690
It's like killer be hunting again.

271
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,810
Probably not that much
better than regular honey,

272
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,160
but sounds bad ass.

273
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,023
So we have it.

274
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,390
Um,

275
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,800
we also have things for kids.

276
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:11,634
We have um,

277
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,390
uh,

278
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,000
green vibrance for kid and Nordic jellies,

279
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:15,570
which are,

280
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,030
um,

281
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,010
their fish oil,

282
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,920
a gummy bears and gummy
worms for little kids.

283
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,083
So it actually,

284
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,800
Mcdonald's fish bites with the McDonald's
fish bite chicken mcnuggets better

285
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:28,860
fish now at Mcdonald's
with a dipping sauce.

286
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,080
You filet of fish
without that white stuff.

287
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:32,790
That tartar sauce is just dog shit.

288
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,960
It's just not good at all.

289
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:37,800
But together pretty damn tasty along
with that sugary been and you know,

290
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:39,330
they put sugar in that fucking button,

291
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,721
that button.

292
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:40,830
It's so bad for you.

293
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,290
The filet of fish buttons
like extra sugary.

294
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,251
Anyway,

295
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:45,720
no extra sugar he had on it.

296
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,750
Go to Oh and and I to use the code
name Rogan and save yourself 10% off.

297
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,481
All Right,

298
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:52,201
ladies and gentlemen,

299
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,580
let's cut the bullshit here.

300
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,421
Cue The music.

301
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:54,840
Brian.

302
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,770
Dan Carlin's here.

303
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:56,880
We're going to learn some shit.

304
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,960
We're going to find out what the fuck
really happened and how we move forward.

305
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,210
The Joe Rogan experience.

306
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,250
[inaudible] we went old school
with the music folks because

307
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,400
Dan Carlin's here of
hardcore history in DC.

308
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:13,881
Common Sense.

309
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:14,870
You have two podcasts.

310
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,530
Yes.

311
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,311
And I'm telling you,

312
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:16,491
man,

313
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:21,140
this is a very few people that have been
requested as many times as you buy the

314
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:21,650
fans.

315
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,120
I owe you for having me here.

316
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,021
I had no idea.

317
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:27,650
We had much crossover on the audience
apparently quite a bit because people

318
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:27,761
don't,

319
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:29,690
my message board or
super pumped about this,

320
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,460
people online is super pumped about this.

321
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,700
I think now more than ever
in this country there's a uh,

322
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,030
learning a yearning rather
to understand how the,

323
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:42,050
how we got here.

324
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:42,731
You know,

325
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:46,130
when you look at the financial crisis
and you look at our ridiculous actions

326
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:47,520
overseas and you looked at it like,

327
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:47,841
like,

328
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:48,620
wow,

329
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,580
there's a lot of kids that are growing
up right now that are in their twenties

330
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,260
and thirties and they,

331
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:54,900
they,

332
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,990
they look at this mess
that we're in as a society,

333
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:58,501
as a culture,

334
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:58,681
as a,

335
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:01,770
as a race really is that the whole
human race and how the hell did this all

336
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:02,604
happen?

337
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,470
And because of that,

338
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:09,450
I think there's more of an interest
in history today than at any time.

339
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:13,560
I remember like young people being like
really interested in history and uh,

340
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,430
when I was younger.

341
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,640
But it seems like there's like a more of
a clamoring for this knowledge now than

342
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:21,210
I think I've ever heard before.

343
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,860
Hi helps when the history channel's
doing monster quest and ice road truckers

344
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,970
kind of leaves a vacuum for some of us
to sort of just shoot through to drive

345
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:32,160
you crazy when you watching
the history channel or it's,

346
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,720
I don't know if it does.

347
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:35,060
Part of me starts to think that yeah,

348
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,301
it opens up.

349
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:36,660
I mean,

350
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:36,991
you know,

351
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:40,230
we were doing some work a while back with
some of these production companies in

352
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,520
La and New York and stuff that had to,

353
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:41,641
you know,

354
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:41,870
we'll,

355
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,570
we'll get this guy from the
history podcast and we'll
develop a show around him.

356
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:48,510
And I'm in these meetings with these
guys and it's like every question just

357
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:48,661
kept,

358
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:49,141
can we,

359
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:51,270
can we make this a little more broad?

360
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:52,104
Can we make this?

361
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:52,771
And eventually,

362
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:52,921
you know,

363
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:56,010
you're going to have Dan Carlin searching
for monsters is what they were looking

364
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:56,970
for I think after,

365
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,740
so we're sticking with the podcast.

366
00:09:58,741 --> 00:09:58,951
I think,

367
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:01,770
I don't think they think there's an
audience for history and yet I think that

368
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:03,270
gives us an audience for history.

369
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,620
There's no place else
for those people to go.

370
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:05,580
They're stuck with me.

371
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,271
Yeah.

372
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,350
It's kind of interesting
what people think that people

373
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,950
I want to and don't want to see because
there's obviously the Internet where you

374
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:14,750
know your podcast is very popular.

375
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:18,830
There's a lot of very popular podcasts
where it's just people talking and you're

376
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:22,550
getting hundreds of thousands of people
to download these things with just

377
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:26,510
people talking and you look at the amount
of people that are tuning into your

378
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:30,050
average television show on a cable
network and it's pretty commensurate.

379
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,130
Isn't that shocking?

380
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:31,731
That's crazy.

381
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,950
It's not so much that
we're all doing so good.

382
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:36,470
It's the television is
really doing so bad.

383
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:36,801
Well,

384
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:39,440
in trying to paint that broad thing,

385
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,860
they've lost any semblance
of being exceptional.

386
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,671
There's just nothing.

387
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:44,360
That's a good way to,

388
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,410
that's a great way to put it.

389
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:45,591
By the way,

390
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:49,580
I'm loving this fungus
free coffee that we blend.

391
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,980
We blended up with a grass fed butter.

392
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:53,600
It's tough to find that grass fed butter.

393
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,410
I've actually started ordering it online.

394
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,870
I would miss the fungus,

395
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:58,450
but I'm finding I'm
getting everything I want.

396
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,293
Right.

397
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,240
The fungus has just given you a headache
apparently according to there's a guy

398
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:03,140
named Dave Asprey.

399
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:05,060
He runs bulletproof exec.com.

400
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:05,901
And uh,

401
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:09,920
he wrote the bulletproof executive and
his idea about bulletproof not being

402
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:10,640
actual bulletproof,

403
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,391
just being that,

404
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:11,691
you know,

405
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:13,790
it's rock solid nutrition,

406
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,810
rock solid,

407
00:11:14,811 --> 00:11:15,050
you know,

408
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,400
management of your body,

409
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:16,671
you know,

410
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:17,211
all this stuff.

411
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,280
And one of the things
that he found out was,

412
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:19,850
um,

413
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,181
the,

414
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:20,421
uh,

415
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:23,260
the mycotoxin and coffee issue that
so many people weren't aware of.

416
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,350
You're going to work and you just,

417
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:24,771
you know,

418
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,050
drinking that coffee
from the coffee machine,

419
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,100
the coffee maker that,

420
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,430
you know,

421
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,001
Bob May,

422
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:29,421
hey Bob,

423
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:31,010
when's the Howells his
coffee 20 minutes ago.

424
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,160
No one's really thinking about what
the fuck is in that actual coffee.

425
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:39,430
But apparently there's quite a bit of
coffee that has fungus on it and unhealthy

426
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,720
mold and that's shit can
apparently be very poisoned.

427
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,071
And you know,

428
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:44,360
our industry functions on this.

429
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:44,901
So without this,

430
00:11:44,901 --> 00:11:45,890
we're just dead in the water.

431
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:46,171
So,

432
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:47,510
but I mean comedy writing,

433
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:51,260
I mean there's so many different
people that create things.

434
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:52,094
He was coughing,

435
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,070
he was doing a show on like the history

436
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,990
of stimulants or whatever,

437
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,930
and it was going to be like a nine
part series because there's so much,

438
00:11:58,931 --> 00:11:59,950
I mean that like you said,

439
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:03,130
the whole creative side of so many
industries without the coffee and other

440
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:03,750
stimulants,

441
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,990
you know,

442
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,860
where do you go Saturday
night live is not around,

443
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:06,071
you know,

444
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,830
without exists or something like that.

445
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,200
Along those lines we'd,

446
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:10,780
yeah,

447
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,330
it's,

448
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,920
it's funny when you think about the
fact that the Boston tea parties is

449
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:15,341
actually,

450
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:18,610
is that really what started people off
drinking coffee in this country when

451
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,060
they,

452
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,320
I don't think so.

453
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:22,330
I think that's one of those
kind of myths sort of things.

454
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:23,170
I think first of all,

455
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:24,280
if you're addicted to tea,

456
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,681
you're not,

457
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:26,100
you're going to just
switch because you know,

458
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,970
somebody put a little tax on it.

459
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:29,470
I mean we can see how that works.

460
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:30,304
A little tax on something,

461
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,810
you just find a way around it.

462
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,490
But how hard was it to get tea back then?

463
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,181
Was it,

464
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:34,481
you know,

465
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:34,841
it was,

466
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,370
it was a hell of a commodity,

467
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,290
but I don't think it
was that hard to get it.

468
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:38,501
I mean,

469
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,131
smugglers,

470
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:41,320
how hard is it to get something
you're not supposed to have today?

471
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,980
So Ti was like a big commodity.

472
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,640
Go to a big t dealer
and behind the scenes,

473
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:45,971
you know,

474
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:46,810
and just have some guy,

475
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:47,111
you know,

476
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:50,710
they can get the t on the side smuggled
in from French Canada or something.

477
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,611
Isn't that bizarre?

478
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:55,300
When you hear about like salt used to
be worth a lot of money still is in the

479
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:55,900
right places.

480
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,000
You take away the salt and
you watch the price go up,

481
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,510
you know?

482
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:58,940
Yeah,

483
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,170
yeah.

484
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,540
But I mean the idea that
people would go to war for it.

485
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,690
Like could you imagine we're headed
to Africa right now to go get salt?

486
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,620
Like that was a,

487
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,090
that was the reality at one point.

488
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,400
I read a whole thing about how Afghanistan
might be all about lithium deposits

489
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:13,180
and stuff and you're going,

490
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,421
oh,

491
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:15,730
50 years ago nobody wanted
lithium for anything.

492
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:17,380
I mean now it's just one
of those things where it,

493
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:17,621
God,

494
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:20,100
we've got to get ahold of Afghanistan and
those lithium things will dry right up

495
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,011
Afghanistan.

496
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:22,650
So rich with other things as well.

497
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,710
Natural gas,

498
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,680
not just the minerals natural
Tyler or ways to mind though.

499
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,540
It's like mining out in a patchy country.

500
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,040
There's inherent risks.

501
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:30,551
Well yeah,

502
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:33,100
that's a lot of folks
who don't understand,

503
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:33,420
uh,

504
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,250
Afghanistan like tougher
conversations with people about it.

505
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:40,570
You can't really compare it to any
other country because it's not really a

506
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,404
country.

507
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,410
It's like a series of warlords and they
control various areas and it's through

508
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:49,930
the whole country and there's only
like a little bit of city life.

509
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,711
There's like,

510
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:51,544
what are is?

511
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,690
What's Kabul?

512
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,680
Is that the big setting?

513
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,490
Kandahar,

514
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,121
places like that.

515
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:59,170
But they are all these are all tribal
PDX and so it's like I'm Indian country.

516
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,460
I mean there's no other
way to describe it.

517
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:01,780
You get in there and you can't make,

518
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:04,840
there's no one to make deals with the
two controls Logan and you have to deal

519
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,880
with this chief and all of a sudden
you don't have to deal with the other

520
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,111
teacher.

521
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,460
He have to like the first
guy and 10 miles away,

522
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:12,220
you're out of your district and
they're all playing a little game.

523
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:15,820
Hammad Karzai's winking to us in one
hand and tell him the domestic audience

524
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:19,360
something on the other hand and
it's like double blind rear end,

525
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:19,571
you know,

526
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:22,360
I mean we just don't play those games
as well as the people in Afghanistan.

527
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,990
Yeah,

528
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,970
well that's a strange culture.

529
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,661
I remember,

530
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:25,901
um,

531
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:29,410
when McCain was running for president
and Obama was talking about going into

532
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,101
Afghanistan,

533
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,770
it was one of the few times that I really,

534
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:33,990
uh,

535
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,370
I really respected and
Mccain for the way he did it,

536
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,320
he would say like,

537
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:39,940
do you understand Afghanistan?

538
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,440
It wasn't even being condescending.

539
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:41,741
He was like,

540
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:43,800
this is like run by this.

541
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,870
It's basically where the same way it
was when Alexander the Great was a lot.

542
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,950
And look at the terrain.

543
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:48,784
If you're a military guy,

544
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,240
just look,

545
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,370
it's,

546
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,260
it's like,

547
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,531
yeah,

548
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:52,040
it's like Sonora over

549
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,430
there,

550
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:52,611
but,

551
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:52,821
but,

552
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:53,511
but worse.

553
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:54,051
And you know,

554
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:54,920
it's one thing to decide.

555
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:58,250
You want to fight a war in some flat
desert place where all of our air power is

556
00:14:58,251 --> 00:14:59,180
gonna make a huge difference.

557
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,730
The terrain is like beyond the Martian,

558
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,600
crazy,

559
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,500
crazy terrain.

560
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:04,700
And so you look around and you just go,

561
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,181
look,

562
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:07,040
the Russians in the 1970s and eighties,

563
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,230
they might not have had the
infrared stuff like we do,

564
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,830
but they were pretty Dang sophisticated
and willing to kill a hell of a lot more

565
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:14,210
people and they couldn't manage it.

566
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:19,211
So it's really scary now that they've
turned in so many parts of the world to

567
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:23,510
drones for these difficult missions.

568
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,111
And,

569
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:24,470
uh,

570
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,861
the,

571
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:28,010
the implications of
using drones on people,

572
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,761
it's a very,

573
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,170
it's a very strange

574
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,670
sort of a conversation to start having
because it's step one on a multistep

575
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:39,160
process where eventually these drones
are going to be intelligent things that

576
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:41,860
are controlling themselves and they're
going to be searching out crime and,

577
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,840
and shooting people from the mountains.

578
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,170
I don't know how you stop that though.

579
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:48,620
I mean it's like saying I don't want to
have tanks because look where tanks are

580
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:48,921
going to go.

581
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:49,711
The problem is,

582
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:51,980
is that we treat them
differently than life people.

583
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:52,970
It's like if,

584
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,781
if you said to yourself,

585
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:57,050
well if he wouldn't go in there with
a human pilot and bomb the place,

586
00:15:57,051 --> 00:16:00,890
cause it'll look like Nixon
bombing Cambodia when you
shouldn't then don't do it

587
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:01,500
with drones.

588
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:01,850
Right.

589
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,000
But if you're going to use
him for occasion and if
we're at war with somebody,

590
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,230
you're going to want the drones.

591
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,180
We don't want to use everybody.

592
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:07,730
Yeah,

593
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,320
but you're not going
to want it if you say,

594
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:12,200
well we couldn't bomb Yemen's
a tribal territories with a,

595
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:13,640
with a bomber and a human being,

596
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:14,331
that would look bad.

597
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:17,240
But we can do it with a machine cause
well there's no Americans there.

598
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:17,760
Yeah,

599
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,780
you're absolutely right.

600
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:22,230
And that's why it becomes a strange
sort of a conversation to have and it's

601
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,400
going on in Pakistan,

602
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:24,810
but we're not really at war with

603
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:25,331
no worries.

604
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:26,930
You're going to start
using them in Africa now.

605
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,531
Yeah.

606
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:29,240
They're flying them in African now.

607
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,400
They were going to use them on dormer.

608
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,970
They were gonna.

609
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,960
They were gonna use,

610
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,090
he was going to be the first target of a,

611
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:37,490
of a drone and on American soil.

612
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,780
That killer that is
still to be w did they,

613
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:42,800
did they confirm that,

614
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,290
that they were going to use a drone
to go after that guy believe so.

615
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,591
I should,

616
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:46,350
I shouldn't.

617
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,650
I absolutely wild if they really are.

618
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:49,311
How do you spell his name?

619
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:50,870
Dormer DOR.

620
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:51,330
Mer.

621
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,350
Was that going to be a decision and
what level do they make that decision?

622
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:54,770
Is that,

623
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,251
is that the,

624
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:58,610
the La Sheriff's office decides that
or you got to call the president?

625
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,050
I can't imagine the White House would
let that happen even if the sheriff's

626
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:03,771
department wanted to,

627
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:06,350
because then all of a sudden you
have to answer all those questions.

628
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:09,740
They're not answering now about is it
okay to kill Americans with a drone on

629
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:10,521
American soil?

630
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:12,590
Well then all of a sudden
that becomes a moot point,

631
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:13,424
doesn't it?

632
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,260
Yeah.

633
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,801
Apparently.

634
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:14,891
Well,

635
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:16,220
this is on Gizmodo,

636
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,050
uh,

637
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,600
ex cop Christopher dormer now at
target for drones to Riverside Police,

638
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,200
uh,

639
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,970
chief Sergio Diaz,

640
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:25,070
joint leader of the Task Force,

641
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,180
uh,

642
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,050
signed with finding dormer has
confirmed and is quoted as saying,

643
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,200
we're using all the tools at our
disposal and a third vague conference.

644
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,700
That doesn't mean he's using drones.

645
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,051
Well,

646
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:35,884
wait a minute.

647
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,930
Do you know what that makes me feel like,

648
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,770
and this is perverse,

649
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:40,450
I have a little bit of a
perverse sense of humor,

650
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,700
but if the guy was going
to die anyway like he did,

651
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,970
I almost wished that they'd done it with
the drones at the local level so that

652
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:48,970
this whole thing explodes
into a national conversation.

653
00:17:48,971 --> 00:17:49,771
Do you think it would,

654
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:50,060
I don't.

655
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,590
I think people don't
know except that he was,

656
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,890
he was obviously an evil Doraemon.

657
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,860
So what is the Burger?

658
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,370
The position it puts Obama and
all of a sudden this whole thing,

659
00:17:58,371 --> 00:18:01,490
you're ducking now you can't duck it
anymore and you're not using it against

660
00:18:01,491 --> 00:18:02,210
terrorists.

661
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:02,750
Well,

662
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,370
it depends on your
definition of a terrorist,

663
00:18:04,371 --> 00:18:05,061
but you know,

664
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:05,301
I mean,

665
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:09,150
any old murderer fleeing the
scene of a murder now is open to,

666
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:09,520
uh,

667
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:09,710
you know,

668
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,251
no judge,

669
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:11,084
no jury,

670
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,500
no due process.

671
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,190
You know,

672
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,001
we knew you killed him.

673
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:14,870
So I mean that's a,

674
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,520
that that's going to happen to you.

675
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:16,671
I mean,

676
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:18,190
we're going to hit that
fine line at some point.

677
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:18,441
Well,

678
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:22,070
they've already started assassinating
American citizens that are in other

679
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:24,170
countries that they believe
in doing things illegal.

680
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,730
The government won't confirm it,

681
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:26,211
but everybody,

682
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:27,044
it's an open secret.

683
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,273
It's a,

684
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,430
it gets real tricky when someone
does denies the rights of,

685
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,800
of citizens than someone who's empowered.

686
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,900
Denies their rights because
w what are you then,

687
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,970
if you're in power and
you're denying their rights,

688
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,810
as soon as you step in and
deny people do processed,

689
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:46,760
deny people lawyers to die people,

690
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,440
why would you ever want to do that?

691
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:49,221
It's a real question.

692
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:51,440
So when things get passed,

693
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:56,060
like the National Defense Authorization
Act allows the government to

694
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:59,600
indefinitely detained American civilians
and they don't have to do anything.

695
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:01,340
They're not required
to notify your family.

696
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,590
They're not required to arrest you.

697
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:04,790
They're not required to.

698
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,290
You don't.

699
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:05,920
You can't,

700
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,070
you don't have to get a lawyer.

701
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,130
They can just lock you up
when you see shit like that.

702
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:10,964
Does that drive you crazy?

703
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,421
Oh yeah.

704
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:12,410
And people always say to me,

705
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:12,681
they say,

706
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:13,280
well,

707
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,461
you know,

708
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:15,320
why are you defending the terrorists?

709
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,350
What you try to explain to people
is without the due process,

710
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,510
there's no confirmation
that this is a terrorist.

711
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:25,280
The only way you know it's a terrorist
is when some court somewhere determines

712
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:28,040
upon looking at the evidence
that this person is a terrorist.

713
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,010
Once you can kill somebody on the
suspicion of being a terrorist,

714
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,671
well,

715
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:35,030
we're all under suspicion of being a
terrorist under certain conditions that

716
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,790
someone wants to deem a
mistaken identity situation.

717
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,390
You know,

718
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,760
or mean how many guys are named
Omar or Mohammad or you know,

719
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,270
I mean,

720
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,391
well,

721
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,190
how about in this dorm or case the,

722
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:47,590
the cop shot up two different
cars that were the wrong color.

723
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,520
Perfect example.

724
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,131
Perfect example.

725
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:49,540
Yeah.

726
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,690
You the,

727
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,700
the idea that the government should
have special powers that regular human

728
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:57,334
beings don't.

729
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,300
That's crazy.

730
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:58,481
Well,

731
00:19:58,481 --> 00:19:59,350
they have that now.

732
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,800
I mean I think they already do because
your government to take it to the next

733
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,110
level and decide that you're going to
deny the rights of people that you feel

734
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:06,551
are guilty.

735
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:06,940
Well,

736
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,840
who are you and how do I know that you're
infallible and how do I know that this

737
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:11,710
isn't corruption?

738
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,870
How do I know this
isn't a personal grudge?

739
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,700
It's not like you're dealing with an
organization that has a spotless record

740
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,691
over the past,

741
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:19,961
you know,

742
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:24,760
200 years where they're the most ethical
human beings to ever exist and people

743
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:26,040
from other countries come to them for,

744
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,231
no,

745
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:27,310
we've caught them a lie,

746
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,130
but $1 million.

747
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:28,221
Oh,

748
00:20:28,221 --> 00:20:28,650
you had could.

749
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,690
We had a committee hearings,

750
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:31,490
which you cannot even imagine today,

751
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:32,960
which shows you how much
things have changed.

752
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,140
In the 1970s we had the church committee
hearings in the Pike Committee hearings

753
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,180
where the government actually
on television exposed
everything the CIA had been

754
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:42,920
doing since the end of
the Second World War.

755
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,110
The assassinations and
all this kind of stuff.

756
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,420
The crown jewels are what the used to
call those secrets that were exposed on

757
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:52,660
television by congressional
and senatorial committees.

758
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,400
It just shows you what happens when
there's no oversight and if stuff is too

759
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:59,020
secret to have oversight over,

760
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,730
you're asking for trouble.

761
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:05,731
There's too many ways human beings
can justify going beyond the rules and

762
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:07,660
there's always a good reason
and you hear it today.

763
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:09,130
I mean the waterboarding thing,

764
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:10,150
as a perfect example,

765
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,330
we prosecuted people at Nuremberg for
having an attitude that we have now,

766
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:16,120
which is,

767
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,451
hey,

768
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:19,780
if they're terrorists and you can
save lives by torturing people.

769
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,780
Isn't that an ethical dilemma where
it's worth torturing some guy,

770
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,051
you know,

771
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:25,780
is bad anyway in order to save lives.

772
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:25,961
I mean,

773
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:29,410
if you could have prevented the two
towers from falling down by waterboarding,

774
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:30,580
a couple of bad guys,

775
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,870
isn't that worth it?

776
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,530
And that those ethical dilemmas lead
you off into the weeds really quickly in

777
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:37,030
history shows that over and over again.

778
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:37,980
It's,

779
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,620
it's very doubtful that
it's helping either.

780
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,980
It's very doubtful that you're really
getting that kind of key information from

781
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:46,900
people by throwing water down their mouth.

782
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,561
You know,

783
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:47,880
I don't,

784
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,251
I just,

785
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:48,790
I don't,

786
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,910
I don't know if if torturing
people get them to tell the truth

787
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,720
gets him to tell you anything you want.

788
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,400
What about would you,

789
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,060
and I wish I could quote it at length.

790
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:59,560
It's a wonderful line going back
hundreds of years where somebody says,

791
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,190
would you abrogate the laws
in order to get the devil?

792
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,060
And the other guy says,

793
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:04,481
no,

794
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:05,080
I would.

795
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,630
I would stick to the laws because if,

796
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:08,560
if you abrogate the laws
to get to the devil,

797
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:12,250
you take away the only thing that
protects yourself eventually.

798
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,420
And that's what this is.

799
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:13,811
People say,

800
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:13,961
well,

801
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:15,760
it's okay to go after
this to get to terrorists.

802
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,540
What makes you think one that it'll
stay with terrorists and to that what a

803
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:20,680
terrorists is,

804
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:22,120
that definition won't change.

805
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,360
The Bush administration was calling
these people that would light,

806
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:25,811
you know,

807
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,700
car dealerships on fire in the middle of
the night when there was no one there.

808
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,270
Ecoterrorists you're going
to drone those people,

809
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:31,710
right?

810
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,970
What are you going to do exactly?

811
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:36,090
Where does the line get drawn and
who gets to decide anti fungal coffee

812
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:38,270
proponents that might
get a little hyped up,

813
00:22:38,271 --> 00:22:40,530
but those motherfuckers
grown those people.

814
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,011
Yeah,

815
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:41,844
it is.

816
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,090
It's a strange time
because the amount of uh,

817
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:47,700
ability to the,

818
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:52,620
to spy on people and to
extract information from your
email and your cell phone

819
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,160
and you know,

820
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,850
they know your,

821
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,860
your di gps at any point in time,

822
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,900
but yet we're still just human beings and
human beings have to be protected from

823
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:01,681
their own instincts.

824
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:06,490
We have to set up a system
of government that has fail.

825
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:11,250
Proof stops where you can't get
past certain levels through,

826
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:11,790
can't,

827
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,470
you can't do certain things.

828
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:14,910
You can't act with impunity.

829
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,930
He can't be a king.

830
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:16,720
You know,

831
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,000
there,

832
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,200
there has to be a due process.

833
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:21,420
There has to be representation.

834
00:23:21,421 --> 00:23:22,710
You have to be able to get a lawyer.

835
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,130
You have to have some,

836
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,721
you have to,

837
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:26,580
as an American citizen be
able to state your case.

838
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:26,881
Well,

839
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:28,140
here's the fly in the ointment though,

840
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:28,471
and this is,

841
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:31,410
this is almost like the founding
fathers tragic flaw in the system.

842
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,480
In war time,

843
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,460
the rules are thrown out the window,

844
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:35,800
right?

845
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,480
In wartime,

846
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,130
the government is allowed to give the,

847
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:38,490
you know,

848
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,250
the congress is supposed to
decide when you go to war.

849
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,900
Then once the war's going on,

850
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:43,734
the president has,

851
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,071
you know,

852
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:47,330
they say extreme constitutional
authority as commander in chief to,

853
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:48,710
to run the war anyway they want.

854
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,760
But this is all predicated on
the idea that the war has an end,

855
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,181
right?

856
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,910
This is a temporary
suspension of normality.

857
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,790
What do you do in a war?

858
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:58,551
Like in a war?

859
00:23:58,551 --> 00:23:59,550
I'm using air quotes.

860
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:01,700
So what do you do in
a war that has no end?

861
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:04,730
Who's going to sign a peace treaty with
us on some battleship to end this war on

862
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:05,450
terror?

863
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,850
This is like saying you don't remember
the Bush administration for Awhile was

864
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:08,870
toying with the idea.

865
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,420
They thought the war on terror
had gotten sort of a bad name.

866
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:14,240
So they were going to do a little
marketing move and change the name and for

867
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:18,080
like five minutes they were calling
it the war on violent extremism,

868
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,080
which I thought was a great line because
that really showed how ridiculous it

869
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:21,710
was.

870
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,210
When's violent extremism over who's going
to sign the the end of the war treaty

871
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:30,320
and surrender to us and the violent
extremism or so we can return to a normal

872
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:33,590
American system with checks and balances
and where the president didn't have,

873
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:33,861
you know,

874
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:34,880
extreme authority.

875
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,440
That's the problem is that we're in a
situation where it's war time and it's

876
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:44,330
going to be war time forever unless
somebody declares it over and if they

877
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:45,170
declared it over,

878
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,220
what stops the next guy after one bombing
in some part of the world to start it

879
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:49,910
up again?

880
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,151
Yeah.

881
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:54,260
Essentially we've been at war in
some functions since the 1940s but

882
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,180
realistically when,

883
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:56,480
you know,

884
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,110
we were in the 90s at least we
didn't feel like we were at war.

885
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,460
We didn't feel like it until 2001 they
didn't invoke the extreme authority

886
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:04,731
either.

887
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:04,921
I mean,

888
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:05,080
it's a,

889
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,270
you know,

890
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,470
they didn't do that in Vietnam.

891
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,011
Even they didn't,

892
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:08,120
the government didn't say,

893
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,781
okay,

894
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:08,920
uh,

895
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,540
we're going to lock up every
one of Vietnamese descent in a,

896
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:13,640
in a cage for awhile
in case they're spies.

897
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,361
This is,

898
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:14,510
uh,

899
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,750
like when Truman did the Korean War
thing and he got around having to declare

900
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:19,010
war by saying it's not a war,

901
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:19,880
it's a police action.

902
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:21,620
That was a marketing tool.

903
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,150
But by doing that,

904
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:27,620
he also essentially swore he didn't
officially because kind of swore off that

905
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,830
and I'm going to have extreme
constitutional authority.

906
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:31,940
He didn't take that up.

907
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,610
It's when Bush did this war on terror
thing and basically the neo-con folks

908
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:36,230
said,

909
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,831
remember John,

910
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:38,330
you the advisor to the president,

911
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:41,570
the office of Legal Counsel said
that if the president wanted to,

912
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,390
he could torture a son to
get the father to talk.

913
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,980
There are no limits in war time.

914
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,070
No one had really invoked that
since the Second World War.

915
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,640
So if you want to have total power,

916
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:53,510
just start war,

917
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:54,651
well,

918
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:55,640
that's an age old thing.

919
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,920
You can go back to the Romans and
the Greeks and they were all in.

920
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,690
They understood that dynamic real well.

921
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,870
And so did the founding fathers of our
country who were classically trained.

922
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:03,530
I mean,

923
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,800
the reason we're not a democracy in one
respect is that they were fully aware of

924
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,010
how that could go and they were
fully aware of what happened to Rome.

925
00:26:10,011 --> 00:26:12,440
So if you look at the checks and
balances in our constitution,

926
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,370
a lot of that stuff is to design,

927
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:16,610
to keep the same thing
from happening to us.

928
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,300
I think they understood that those
things break down over time though.

929
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,590
And that in essentially you might have
a lifespan to what they were creating.

930
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,371
And that sense,

931
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:26,480
it's very fascinating,

932
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:28,600
the idea of a representative
democracy and the,

933
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:31,640
the idea that there's an electoral
college and the idea that there's,

934
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,810
there's a few steps
beyond actual democracy.

935
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:36,381
It's like,

936
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:37,310
it's sort of,

937
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,180
it's sort of,

938
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,013
you get a vote,

939
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,180
but you get to vote for a representative.

940
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:43,980
You don't get to completely vote like

941
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,761
one person,

942
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:45,594
one vote.

943
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,200
And,

944
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,530
uh,

945
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,400
the idea behind it initially was
sorta to protect people from their own

946
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:50,941
silliness,

947
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:51,540
right?

948
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:51,781
Well,

949
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:52,260
they didn't,

950
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,250
the founding fathers didn't necessarily
like the idea of average people running

951
00:26:56,251 --> 00:26:56,880
the show.

952
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,140
If you looked at the state laws,

953
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,630
most states wouldn't
let average joes vote.

954
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:00,841
I mean,

955
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:04,140
if you were working for
a tinker in Virginia,

956
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:05,520
you probably weren't allowed to vote.

957
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:07,560
You used to have to be a landowner
and most of these states,

958
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:10,920
and what that was designed to do was
to limit the vote to stakeholders,

959
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:11,491
right?

960
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:14,880
They figured if you could run a
farm without going out of business,

961
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,360
you probably knew enough about what
was going on to be an educated voter.

962
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,830
Plus they didn't like the idea.

963
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:20,460
I mean,

964
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,271
you'll probably know this,

965
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:23,670
that after the revolution
wasn't that long afterwards,

966
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:27,060
we had things like the whiskey
rebellion and the Shay's rebellion.

967
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,110
These are new revolutions and their
revolutions coming from the lower classes

968
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,640
and our brand new,

969
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:32,881
you know,

970
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:36,150
radical founding fathers shut those
things down like nobody's business.

971
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,261
Yeah.

972
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:37,670
It's,

973
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,610
it's weird

974
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,760
when you think like that.

975
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,750
You think that the founding fathers
didn't necessarily want everybody to vote

976
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:44,051
and be like,

977
00:27:44,051 --> 00:27:44,371
wait,

978
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:44,831
wait a minute,

979
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:45,664
what?

980
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,300
But,

981
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,010
but the romantic version of it is that
they were these beautiful people that had

982
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:54,790
this idea of treating people the way
they deserve to be treated in govern with

983
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:56,310
respect and honesty and

984
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,061
well,

985
00:27:57,061 --> 00:27:58,380
but also look at the times.

986
00:27:58,381 --> 00:27:58,591
I mean,

987
00:27:58,591 --> 00:27:58,950
yeah,

988
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,350
I mean when you realize that
when they had the revolution,

989
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:05,850
we became the first major country in
the world that had anything like that.

990
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,080
Then you start to realize,

991
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:07,411
okay,

992
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:12,150
we're looking back at our standards now
and not realizing how radical those guys

993
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:13,050
were for their day.

994
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:15,990
And it's worth pointing out that only
a few years after our revolution,

995
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,430
the French had theirs,

996
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:20,070
which got wickedly out
of hand very quickly.

997
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,310
And our founding fathers were looking at
what happened in France and the French

998
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:24,960
were saying that a lot of
what they were doing was,

999
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,951
was was as,

1000
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:26,460
as you know,

1001
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,000
sort of a respecting kind
of thing from what you know,

1002
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,000
reflection of ours.

1003
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:30,870
And they were going,

1004
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,980
don't blame that on us.

1005
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:33,390
We never would have gone that far.

1006
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:34,710
We wouldn't kill noblemen we would.

1007
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,050
So I think it was radical for the times.

1008
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:40,500
It looks very conservative
and a little little fascist.

1009
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:41,700
Now when we look back on it,

1010
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,330
the one thing that concerns me now,

1011
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,840
I mean,

1012
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,020
uh,

1013
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,090
I think this country is,

1014
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:47,810
we,

1015
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,420
we sort of feel that we're
immune to a revolution.

1016
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:52,310
I don't think that anybody has any,

1017
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,800
I think the average person,

1018
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:58,160
I shouldn't say they don't think
that anyone's going to overthrow the

1019
00:28:58,161 --> 00:28:58,700
government.

1020
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,820
It's not really anything that
anybody really believes or thinks of.

1021
00:29:01,821 --> 00:29:02,390
It's like,

1022
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:02,961
Oh God,

1023
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:03,111
you know,

1024
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:04,880
the United States government
is way too big for that.

1025
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:09,140
But there's a lot of people
in this country that don't
think that there's a lot

1026
00:29:09,141 --> 00:29:11,150
of people in this country
that are stockpiling guns.

1027
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,330
And there's a lot of people
in this country that think
that the government's ban

1028
00:29:14,331 --> 00:29:18,110
on assault weapons and all these
different magazine restrictions is just

1029
00:29:18,111 --> 00:29:20,300
designed to squash the,

1030
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,960
the oppression or the rather
resistance to their oppression.

1031
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,220
And that when,

1032
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,360
when the time comes,

1033
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,140
you know,

1034
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,150
they're not going to give up their
guns because they know what's going to

1035
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:29,510
happen.

1036
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,550
That the government's
going to come and get,

1037
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:30,710
like,

1038
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,570
I've never heard this before in my life,

1039
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:33,440
this kind of thinking,

1040
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,360
I don't remember it in high school.

1041
00:29:35,361 --> 00:29:36,530
I don't remember in college,

1042
00:29:36,531 --> 00:29:37,250
I don't remember.

1043
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,110
But now I read about it on the Internet,

1044
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,730
like on a fairly regular basis.

1045
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:42,700
I read about people that are saying,

1046
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,480
I've read,

1047
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:43,870
um,

1048
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,021
uh,

1049
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:44,600
there was,

1050
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:44,970
uh,

1051
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:45,470
uh,

1052
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:45,810
what,

1053
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:50,810
what it was the task force where a police
chief was developing a task force to

1054
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,870
protect them in case they're a invaded
by the United States government.

1055
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,050
Oh,

1056
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,890
that was in Texas.

1057
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,670
In Texas.

1058
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,960
One of those wacky places.

1059
00:29:58,961 --> 00:29:59,890
I thought it was Oklahoma,

1060
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:01,600
but it was one of those
places where you're like,

1061
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:01,781
Whoa,

1062
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:02,321
settle down.

1063
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:02,560
But,

1064
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,191
but hold on,

1065
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:04,024
keep talking.

1066
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,170
What the fuck are you thinking?

1067
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,011
Like what do you,

1068
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:07,150
what do you think is going on?

1069
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,150
You think the is going to come
and take all the guns and they're,

1070
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:15,151
they're ready to put together a task
force to like band together to protect the

1071
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:18,820
citizens and their guns from
the oppressive government.

1072
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,180
I've never heard talk like that from
an elected official in recent memory.

1073
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,430
You got two different things going on
here and they're both really important.

1074
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:27,860
The first one was when you talked
about the revolution thing,

1075
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,420
I'm of a different mind.

1076
00:30:29,421 --> 00:30:33,590
I try to look at what's the likelihood
of a staying the way we are.

1077
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,700
I'm not sure.

1078
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,330
I mean,

1079
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,780
could could a revolution happened?

1080
00:30:36,781 --> 00:30:37,101
Sure,

1081
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:42,101
but could we go the other way too where
there's just a cracking down on things

1082
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,670
to an even more extent.

1083
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:44,360
In other words,

1084
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,910
the government gets overthrown
on one side of the spectrum.

1085
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,040
The government cracks down and says,

1086
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:49,401
okay,

1087
00:30:49,401 --> 00:30:50,900
all this constitutional stuff we've,

1088
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,890
we've paid attention to.

1089
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:52,640
We can't do that.

1090
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:52,910
You know,

1091
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,590
if two more buildings fall down,

1092
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,540
I think all,

1093
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,731
you know,

1094
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,460
ever been just going to throw
everything out the window.

1095
00:30:58,461 --> 00:31:01,400
I mean look at how far we've
come since the nine 11 attacks.

1096
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,840
Now magnify that.

1097
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,720
If it happened again
from where we are now.

1098
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:10,160
So I think the real question is can we
really see things staying in this middle

1099
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:13,550
ground where we are for
another 10 or 20 or 30 years?

1100
00:31:13,551 --> 00:31:15,410
I could see it going to either extreme.

1101
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,430
It's hard for me to imagine us actually
staying in this sort of status that

1102
00:31:19,431 --> 00:31:20,264
we're in right now.

1103
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,410
They certainly think we're
in a period of change.

1104
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,413
Um,

1105
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,160
what I wonder is,

1106
00:31:25,161 --> 00:31:29,910
is it possible that people could
be organized enough to do it and,

1107
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,180
and,

1108
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,650
and get something going
on without violence?

1109
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,270
I mean is,

1110
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,570
is it possible to,

1111
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:41,940
is it possible to overhaul government
from an elected official point of view?

1112
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,840
Can you just elect the right people and
slowly but surely they'd take care of

1113
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:46,111
things.

1114
00:31:46,111 --> 00:31:46,351
I mean,

1115
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:46,681
is it,

1116
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:48,110
is it even possible at this point?

1117
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,491
Well,

1118
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,920
I want to address your other point cause
I think that was very good to the idea

1119
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:51,581
of this whole,

1120
00:31:51,581 --> 00:31:51,911
um,

1121
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:52,091
you know,

1122
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:54,350
we need the guns to stop
the government from,

1123
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,570
from taking over or whatever.

1124
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,230
I first encountered this when I was on
the radio in Oregon because once you get

1125
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:00,400
out into the back country,

1126
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:00,970
where are you getting?

1127
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,780
And this was in the era of the so called
militia movement and everything and you

1128
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:07,450
get these people calling you
talking about that exact thing.

1129
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:07,661
You know,

1130
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:08,740
what happened in malicious,

1131
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,360
I think the mainstream,

1132
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,040
I think they're still out there.

1133
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:12,580
I think they're just,

1134
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,330
they're the people in the government
and the guy who you mentioned in Texas,

1135
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,630
probably an old militia member,

1136
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,793
but these guys,

1137
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,440
and this is something that the um,

1138
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,860
the nras kind of pushed to the areas of
very different animal than it was 30 or

1139
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:24,670
40 years ago.

1140
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,240
And one of the things they talk about now
that they didn't use to talk about was

1141
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:31,390
this idea that part of the reasons we
have a second amendment is to overthrow

1142
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:31,961
the government.

1143
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:32,794
If you need to,

1144
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,873
um,

1145
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,250
I'll leave that to a
constitutional expert.

1146
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:37,210
I would just point out that,

1147
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,640
that I think people who
think like that are,

1148
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:41,180
are,

1149
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,180
are not paying a whole lot of attention
to how much things have changed

1150
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:45,014
militarily.

1151
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,000
You and I were talking
about drones a minute ago,

1152
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:51,740
who thinks any government person's
going to put themselves out as a target?

1153
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:53,390
They're just going to send
a drone to your house.

1154
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:54,350
And you know,

1155
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:54,831
I mean I think,

1156
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:57,500
I think that ship has sailed
but there's a lot of people,

1157
00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:00,700
you remember there was Randy
Weaver up in Idaho that got um,

1158
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,220
you know,

1159
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,910
into this conflict with federal agents
cause he's at the Ruby Ridge as he saw

1160
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:05,030
it,

1161
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,460
a shotgun off a little too
far in a government agent,

1162
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:10,250
bought it from him and then all of a
sudden their surrounding his cabin and

1163
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:12,560
shooting his dog and shooting
his wife and killing his son,

1164
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,660
which really was a kind of a bad deal.

1165
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,050
I mean it was,

1166
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:15,883
it was,

1167
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,791
he had a case,

1168
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:17,750
this is what I guess I'm saying,

1169
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,190
but he was a bad enough,

1170
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:22,910
weird enough unibomber looking kind
of dude that you could spin that into.

1171
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:24,920
Well he's a radical
gun nuts kind of thing.

1172
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,450
And then you have the
Waco situation happened.

1173
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:27,921
Same thing.

1174
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:29,360
A bunch of really weird dudes.

1175
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:30,860
So you want to kind of go,

1176
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,401
well,

1177
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:31,581
I mean,

1178
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:32,630
look at who you're dealing with,

1179
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:33,770
child abuse and this or that.

1180
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:38,600
But you kind of lose how nasty a deal
that was because it's like terrorist.

1181
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:39,890
You can do anything you want to terrorist.

1182
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:41,180
And if it's to terrorists,

1183
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,470
we don't care as much.

1184
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,573
Um,

1185
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,800
I think when you talk about,

1186
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,490
um,

1187
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,770
changing the elected
officials and all that,

1188
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,330
we talk about this all the time.

1189
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,541
I mean,

1190
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:50,930
let's,

1191
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:51,380
let's,

1192
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,670
let's call it as it really is.

1193
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:53,720
We have a corrupt government.

1194
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,890
Um,

1195
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,970
when you have a representative,

1196
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,463
undeniably,

1197
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,540
and they'll tell you that
if you catch him off record,

1198
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:00,140
they know.

1199
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,690
And when you have a government
that's a representative democracy,

1200
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:03,021
like we have,

1201
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:04,700
you have a government by middlemen,

1202
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,270
right?

1203
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,140
We have a membrane.

1204
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:09,380
If Joe Rogan gets a bunch of
people together to change the laws,

1205
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,900
you have to go through
these representatives.

1206
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,880
If that membrane is corrupt,

1207
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,500
no matter what you do,

1208
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,800
when you end up with legislation
on the other side of that membrane,

1209
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:21,080
it's going to have been
tainted on the way through.

1210
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,810
And this is why when
you talk about reform,

1211
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,970
reform has to get through those people.

1212
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,760
They're the ones benefiting
from the way things are,

1213
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:29,540
right?

1214
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,111
So in other words,

1215
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:30,411
if you say,

1216
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:32,210
let's have some
anticorruption legislation,

1217
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,910
who is going to be the
people most hurt by that?

1218
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:37,370
The people that benefit
from the way things are.

1219
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,560
So this is sort of the
fly in the ointment.

1220
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:43,400
How do you get corruption reform through
the very people that are benefiting

1221
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,323
from corruption?

1222
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,530
So that's the problem.

1223
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,700
And what is the answer?

1224
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,171
Well,

1225
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,640
this is another question entirely.

1226
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:51,710
I think this is when you pressure people,

1227
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:52,640
I think when you talk about,

1228
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,390
let me think about the sixties protests.

1229
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:56,060
People today make a big deal.

1230
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:00,080
If you can get 50,000 people out
with signs for one afternoon,

1231
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,530
that's a huge protest in the
world of the 21st century.

1232
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,360
You've got to think of sixties protests
when you have two hundred and fifty

1233
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,800
thousand three hundred
thousand four hundred thousand
civil rights type protests

1234
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,990
that are putting real
pressure on the government.

1235
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,690
I think that's what it's gonna take.

1236
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:16,250
It's gonna take a real feeling like,

1237
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:16,760
okay,

1238
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,593
the Jig is up.

1239
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,140
Um,

1240
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,590
this whole,

1241
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:18,801
you know,

1242
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:19,700
we're in threatened,

1243
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,960
we're threatened with revolution.

1244
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:23,090
You talked about revolution
were threatened with revolution.

1245
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:26,660
If we don't buckle down and you're going
to have to have those people that are

1246
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:27,470
really feel like,

1247
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:27,771
okay,

1248
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:28,551
we have no choice.

1249
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:31,850
I don't care what my contributor
gave me to push this idea.

1250
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:34,640
We're going to have to at least throw
something out there that's a fig leaf.

1251
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,630
And they don't feel that pressure.

1252
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:38,070
Now is it possible,

1253
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,820
and this was my,

1254
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,451
my question,

1255
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:43,950
is it possible to go and get new
elected officials and change that?

1256
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:44,191
I mean,

1257
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:48,300
can you get people that aren't willing
to be corrupt and aren't willing to

1258
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,440
capitalize on the system as it's
written right now and profit off of it?

1259
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:53,700
And

1260
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:53,920
yeah,

1261
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,120
that scene from the Kevin Costner
version of the untouchables,

1262
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,470
there's a scene in that movie,

1263
00:35:58,471 --> 00:36:02,370
and I quote it all the time where Al
Capone has bought off the jury and he's

1264
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:04,920
sitting in court and he knows he has
nothing to worry about cause he's paid off

1265
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:05,754
the whole jury.

1266
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,620
And they've realized that
he's paid off the jury.

1267
00:36:07,621 --> 00:36:08,401
So at the last minute,

1268
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:09,720
right before the verdict is read,

1269
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,890
the judge dismisses all the jury members
and brings in all the alternates and

1270
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:15,540
screws up the whole thing
because now all of a sudden,

1271
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:16,710
instead of a corrupt jury,

1272
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,360
you have one that hasn't been bought off.

1273
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,830
The way our government is set up is
designed to keep radical change from

1274
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:23,664
happening.

1275
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:28,440
It doesn't turn over all at once and
there's a seniority system so that,

1276
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:33,441
let's say you elected a third of the
congress is new people not corrupt.

1277
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,261
They're part of an,

1278
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:34,520
you know,

1279
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,550
you have the tea party thing.

1280
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:37,170
Now imagine instead of the tea party,

1281
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,500
you had an anticorruption movement that
was able to bring in a whole bunch of

1282
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:44,860
new congresspeople and their whole
shtick is that we're non-corrupt,

1283
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,170
we're not going to vote
for any of this corruption.

1284
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,780
The first thing that's going to happen
is they're going to be told to sit in the

1285
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:51,990
back of the room and shut
up till they have seniority.

1286
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:52,741
When you're here,

1287
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:54,120
two or three terms,

1288
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,130
we'll maybe give you a committee position.

1289
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,170
If you show that you're
going to play ball,

1290
00:36:58,171 --> 00:36:59,340
we'll let you run the committee.

1291
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:02,550
I mean there's this whole system where
you don't get to be influential until

1292
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:06,750
you've proven you're a good corrupt
official for a long time and you're not

1293
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:09,450
allowed to overthrow the
entire government at once.

1294
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,990
You have to go in there and then you're
still going to have John Kerry and John

1295
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,810
Mccain and all those guys running
the show while you're in the back.

1296
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,100
If you're lucky,

1297
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:20,760
getting a chance to give a speech on
Cspan in front of an empty congression a

1298
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:23,490
room because all of your
compatriots are out fundraising.

1299
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,240
Do you know that they have phone banks
right off the congressional property

1300
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:29,910
cause you're not allowed to
fundraise on government property.

1301
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:34,650
So they've built these phone banks like
one foot off government property and

1302
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:37,860
they go in there and they cast their vote
and then their aids take them right to

1303
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:39,690
the phone banks and they
start the fundraising.

1304
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,110
80% of their time is spent fundraising
and they don't want to do this.

1305
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:44,580
I should say that some of these guys,

1306
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,270
um,

1307
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,421
you know,

1308
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:47,550
Peter De Fazio is a
congressman from Oregon.

1309
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,030
He didn't run for Senate because he said
I'm already fundraising more than my

1310
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:54,960
conscience will allow and if I become a
senator I have to do even more of that.

1311
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,850
So there are some good people in there.

1312
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:57,480
They're just,

1313
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,500
I think outnumbered,

1314
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,430
you know,

1315
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,590
85% to 15 or something like that.

1316
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,650
So their fund raising is essentially
just person to person phone calls.

1317
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,381
Oh yeah.

1318
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:09,770
And as a matter of fact they
will tell you when and you know,

1319
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,930
you can almost see how they've compromised
their own moral sense when you have a

1320
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:14,400
conversation with some of these guys.

1321
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,660
Cause like one of them told me,

1322
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:15,901
he said,

1323
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:16,680
listen,

1324
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,680
this is democracy in action and it's
okay because anybody can play this game.

1325
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,490
He said if you have money,

1326
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,630
and I said what about poor people?

1327
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:27,360
It's the poor people could get together
in large organizations and groups.

1328
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,360
He said if you have money you get to play.

1329
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:31,800
He said it's totally fair.

1330
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,780
It's a totally level playing field.

1331
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,200
Anybody can take part,

1332
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:38,920
but money is how you get our attention
and they've convinced themselves that

1333
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:39,754
this is fine.

1334
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,541
To be honest,

1335
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:44,800
it's been going on in one form or another
for so long and some of these guys

1336
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:46,600
have been on the hill for 30 years.

1337
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,321
I mean to them,

1338
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,580
this is just how it works.

1339
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,150
Um,

1340
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,520
Lawrence Lessig um,

1341
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:51,910
wrote a book where he,

1342
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:55,360
he talked to some of these guys
and they're almost confused.

1343
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:56,590
He had one guy where he went in and,

1344
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:56,781
and,

1345
00:38:56,781 --> 00:39:00,430
and the guy was voting on one side
of an issue and Lawrence Lessig said,

1346
00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:00,521
well,

1347
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:01,930
what about this other side of the issue?

1348
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,560
And the guy was completely unaware that
anybody disagreed with the issue at all

1349
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:08,260
because he hadn't heard from the other
side because the other side hadn't given

1350
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:08,681
any money.

1351
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:10,540
He was unaware there was another side.

1352
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,310
Wow.

1353
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:12,500
You know,

1354
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:12,790
so,

1355
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,451
so in a sense,

1356
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,580
I mean I'm not trying to
let these guys off the hook,

1357
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,200
but they're in this bubble.

1358
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:17,680
I mean,

1359
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,910
I remember we had a,

1360
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,230
I'll even name a name here.

1361
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:22,510
I had senator Mark Hatfield
on my radio show once,

1362
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:27,511
and this is way back in the 1990s and
he comes on the show and he's about 80

1363
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:32,671
years old and he's led by the hand by
some 19 year old girl who's his aide,

1364
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,190
who's talking to him like
he's an Alzheimer's patient.

1365
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:36,791
Okay,

1366
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,571
Senator Hatfield's,

1367
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:40,750
you're going to sit down and you're
going to talk to this guy for 15 minutes.

1368
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:41,171
Exactly.

1369
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:42,040
Then we have to go to the car.

1370
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,641
And I mean,

1371
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:43,480
he was like an uh,

1372
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,590
he was like a robot.

1373
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:44,951
I mean,

1374
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:45,161
he was,

1375
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:45,521
okay,

1376
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:45,761
okay,

1377
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,470
I'll talk to this guy and
then where are we going next?

1378
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:48,131
And I mean,

1379
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:49,210
I thought the guy was like,

1380
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:49,391
you know,

1381
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:50,560
a Manchurian candidate.

1382
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:52,030
They just hopped up on some kind of,

1383
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,090
they'd given him an injection and then
they just lead him to wherever he has to

1384
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:55,271
go.

1385
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:56,260
But in a sense,

1386
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:58,570
I felt sorry for the guy
because to go in and say,

1387
00:39:58,571 --> 00:39:59,680
what are you doing about corruption?

1388
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:01,390
The first thing he's going to
do is turn to his aid and goes,

1389
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:02,520
do we have a corruption problem?

1390
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,580
It was just on my schedule.

1391
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:05,170
I mean he really did know.

1392
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,870
So I don't want to cast
these people as evil.

1393
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,720
I'm not sure how much they're
aware of some of this stuff.

1394
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:11,171
We'll also,

1395
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:14,110
the businesses existed
in this certain form,

1396
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,120
the form that it's in right
now for quite a long time.

1397
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,500
So this is nothing new.

1398
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:17,650
It's,

1399
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,550
it's an evolution.

1400
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,100
So when they come into this Gig,

1401
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,810
everybody who works the Gig,

1402
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,051
I mean,

1403
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:23,481
as they're,

1404
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:26,380
they're learning the business
and learning how it works.

1405
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,390
It's just this is how it is.

1406
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:28,691
Oh Man.

1407
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:29,830
You go to orientation,

1408
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:33,160
if you get elected of Joe Rogan gets
elected to Congress your first week on the

1409
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:33,341
hill,

1410
00:40:33,341 --> 00:40:36,880
you go to orientation and they're going
to tell you where the cafeteria is.

1411
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,661
They're going to tell you,

1412
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:37,901
you know,

1413
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:39,310
where the phone banks
are and this and that.

1414
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,030
And the other thing,

1415
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,361
I mean,

1416
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:45,361
you get essentially trained how to be an
elected official and then they sit you

1417
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:48,700
in the back and you get to watch how
business is done for a term or two.

1418
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:49,331
You know?

1419
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:49,661
And that's how,

1420
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:50,020
I mean,

1421
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,350
look at,

1422
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,250
look at Ron Wyden.

1423
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:52,150
He's another Oregon senator.

1424
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:55,060
He's the one making the big stink about
not being able to get any of these

1425
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:57,070
secret documents on the
drones and everything else.

1426
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:59,680
Widen is on the Senate
intelligence committee,

1427
00:40:59,681 --> 00:41:04,360
which I believe is eight senators and
you'd have to be there like forever to get

1428
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,410
on the intelligence committee.

1429
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:08,470
And the committee is supposed to be the
ones who actually get the secret stuff.

1430
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,333
Believe it or not,

1431
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,410
we don't tell senators the secret stuff.

1432
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,810
We only tell the people on
the intelligence committee,

1433
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,560
the secret stuff about intelligence
and widened says the eight guys on that

1434
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:18,910
can't get the information.

1435
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:24,150
So you have to be a senator for years
and years and years to be trusted enough

1436
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,290
to be on the intelligence committee.

1437
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,161
So when you say,

1438
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:29,950
couldn't we get new people in here
and couldn't that fix everything?

1439
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,220
No new person's going to even be given
the secret intelligence until they prove

1440
00:41:34,221 --> 00:41:36,620
that they will play ball for many terms.

1441
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,080
And then you don't get to be the head
of the intelligence committee until you

1442
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,010
prove that even more.

1443
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,311
So.

1444
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:43,070
It's essentially if you looked at
the government as a living organism,

1445
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:44,660
it's like it's trying to protect itself.

1446
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:45,890
It has an immunity system.

1447
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:46,001
It's,

1448
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:46,140
Yep,

1449
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,580
it every bureaucracy is like that.

1450
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,600
Most companies when they get
large enough or even like that.

1451
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,130
Now tell me about these phone banks.

1452
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:52,581
So they,

1453
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:53,090
they,

1454
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:53,420
they,

1455
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:58,070
they get off the floor and they go one
foot pass the government at the property

1456
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,240
and they just call who,

1457
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:01,074
who are these people?

1458
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,310
How do they get their numbers right?

1459
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:02,560
Well,

1460
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,320
generally what happens is they have a
staff and they're going to have somebody

1461
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:08,410
on their staff who helps them raise
money and there's going to be fundraising

1462
00:42:08,411 --> 00:42:09,244
targets.

1463
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,690
Lessig talks about this in his book.

1464
00:42:10,691 --> 00:42:11,410
They will say,

1465
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:16,060
you need to raise this much per day and
if you fall short the next day it just,

1466
00:42:16,061 --> 00:42:16,751
it rolls over.

1467
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:20,620
You have to make that much more per day
and they'll have targeting goals that

1468
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:24,190
are designed to be met by the next
time you have to start campaigning.

1469
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,570
Now is that money to
support their next campaign?

1470
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,020
That is that money what it is?

1471
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,340
That's

1472
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,700
the best question of all because this
is the one empowering thing about the

1473
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:37,810
whole deal that goes right back to us
as voters and how we can actually change

1474
00:42:37,811 --> 00:42:38,620
things.

1475
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,180
This money is mostly,

1476
00:42:40,181 --> 00:42:41,980
some of it's for campaign organization,

1477
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:42,191
right?

1478
00:42:42,191 --> 00:42:43,630
You want your guys going door to door,

1479
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:44,350
you want to have,

1480
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:47,200
you want to have your campaign office
opened up in Iowa if you're running for

1481
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:48,220
president right away,

1482
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:48,371
you know,

1483
00:42:48,371 --> 00:42:48,851
those kind of things.

1484
00:42:48,851 --> 00:42:50,020
So there's some money that goes to that,

1485
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,810
but the majority of this
money is designed for ads.

1486
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,231
Right?

1487
00:42:53,231 --> 00:42:56,800
And what are the ads designed
to do to change your mind?

1488
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,050
What if the ads didn't work anymore?

1489
00:42:59,260 --> 00:42:59,541
You know,

1490
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:00,374
why all of a sudden,

1491
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:00,940
you know,

1492
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,390
we already are from a generation that's
a lot more cynical about advertising

1493
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:04,721
anyway.

1494
00:43:04,721 --> 00:43:08,170
And you and I are both in a business where
we realize how much of a tougher time

1495
00:43:08,171 --> 00:43:10,630
advertisers have than they used to have.

1496
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,291
And the old days,

1497
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:11,471
I mean,

1498
00:43:11,471 --> 00:43:12,101
all you have to do is,

1499
00:43:12,101 --> 00:43:12,580
you know,

1500
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,360
we have a new,

1501
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:13,660
uh,

1502
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,600
surreal and it's got some different
colored marshmallows and boom.

1503
00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:18,670
I mean they're selling
that like hotcakes now.

1504
00:43:18,671 --> 00:43:19,060
It's,

1505
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,380
it's a much more cynical group.

1506
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:23,380
We have the dvrs and all these
things that allow you to skip ads.

1507
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,510
What if they stopped working?

1508
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:28,690
What if the old people who still buy
into advertising the old way it happens.

1509
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:32,110
That generation goes away and now
all of a sudden everybody's like us.

1510
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,650
Don't you devalue what that money buys?

1511
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:40,210
Haven't we changed the system simply by
not paying attention to the ads that the

1512
00:43:40,211 --> 00:43:41,290
entire system,

1513
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:43,570
the money is designed to change your mind.

1514
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,580
If it doesn't change your mind anymore,

1515
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,211
it doesn't.

1516
00:43:46,211 --> 00:43:47,350
The whole thing kind of collapsed.

1517
00:43:47,351 --> 00:43:47,531
I mean,

1518
00:43:47,531 --> 00:43:49,120
I don't know cause we
haven't seen it happen,

1519
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,810
but that seems to be the whole fly in the
ointment when it comes to campaign and

1520
00:43:52,811 --> 00:43:54,100
money raising and everything else.

1521
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,020
If I can't change your
mind with the money,

1522
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,920
why do I want to sell my soul and
spend 80% of my time fundraising?

1523
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,660
The whole point is to change your mind.

1524
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,231
Well,

1525
00:44:02,231 --> 00:44:05,110
the one thing that always changes
my mind is those negative ads,

1526
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,730
like the really obvious one,

1527
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,180
you know,

1528
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,680
President Obama Odor,

1529
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:08,891
you know,

1530
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:10,300
like when they get like real,

1531
00:44:10,301 --> 00:44:11,160
super negative,

1532
00:44:11,161 --> 00:44:12,820
you just can't trust him.

1533
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,480
Why those work though?

1534
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,480
They work because you
don't have an alternative.

1535
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:17,620
I mean it,

1536
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,450
that's the whole democratic
and republican thing.

1537
00:44:19,451 --> 00:44:23,530
If you had five choices and one guy
went negative against another guy,

1538
00:44:23,531 --> 00:44:24,370
the average voter to say,

1539
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:24,461
well,

1540
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:25,151
I'm not voting for either.

1541
00:44:25,151 --> 00:44:26,690
I've heard bad things
about both those guys.

1542
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:28,030
So I'm voting for this third party.

1543
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,880
The two party thing gets you
into the lesser of two evils,

1544
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,250
or your waste,

1545
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,270
your vote nonsense.

1546
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,261
And that's where,

1547
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:34,501
I mean,

1548
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:35,820
that's why the negative ads work.

1549
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:36,654
Like they do that.

1550
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,240
That's something that would go
away if you had multiple choices.

1551
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:41,730
You can't do five
negative ads very easily.

1552
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,241
Well,

1553
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:45,930
it became much more difficult
for independence after Ron,

1554
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:47,131
not Ron Paul,

1555
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:47,641
excuse me.

1556
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:48,570
After um,

1557
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,200
Perot.

1558
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,840
Ross Perot.

1559
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,480
Yeah.

1560
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:50,760
Yeah.

1561
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,760
When Ross Perot came around and paid
for his own television half hour to uh,

1562
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:57,600
you know,

1563
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,920
talk about his campaign and taxes and
where your money's going and the Federal

1564
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,490
Reserve.

1565
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:05,220
A lot of people have never
heard any of that stuff before.

1566
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,710
What if a not so goofy
character had done it too?

1567
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,130
I mean,

1568
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,600
what if you'd had somebody who would,

1569
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:10,860
if Robert Redford,

1570
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:11,031
you know,

1571
00:45:11,031 --> 00:45:11,970
he gets right,

1572
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,130
I had a political science professor,

1573
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:14,311
yeah.

1574
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:14,820
From,

1575
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,690
he was from Germany,

1576
00:45:15,691 --> 00:45:19,710
real old guy when I was in college and
he said that one of the flaws in the

1577
00:45:19,711 --> 00:45:22,820
American system was that they have the PR,

1578
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,180
the job of president is actually
two jobs in most foreign countries.

1579
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:31,710
Usually you'll have like a prime minister
and a guy who's called the chancellor

1580
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:32,544
or the president,

1581
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,570
the prime ministers,

1582
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,980
the bean counter guy,

1583
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:35,761
the guy who's really,

1584
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:35,911
you know,

1585
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:39,480
you put in there to do the work and then
the chancellor or the president is the

1586
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:40,314
figurehead guy,

1587
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,910
the guy who goes to the state funerals,

1588
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:44,070
the one who embodies
the soul of the nation.

1589
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,740
And this guy said in your country,

1590
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,780
those two things have to
be in the same person.

1591
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:50,340
So when you elect to Ronald Reagan,

1592
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,230
what you were electing is a John Wayne.

1593
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,690
You want that guy.

1594
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:54,021
I mean who,

1595
00:45:54,021 --> 00:45:55,230
who do you think of as president?

1596
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:58,530
You don't want some wimpy bean
counter account and looking guy.

1597
00:45:58,531 --> 00:46:00,330
You want some guy that looks like America,

1598
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:00,870
right?

1599
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:04,380
But how often do you get the skills
you want in the bean counter?

1600
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,280
I say bean counter,

1601
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:05,910
but you know it's a,

1602
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:06,870
it's a whole range of things.

1603
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:11,820
But how often are you going to combine
the Robert Redford look of a person with

1604
00:46:11,821 --> 00:46:13,560
the guy who's going to have all
those other qualities you want,

1605
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:14,810
especially if they've been an eraser,

1606
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,460
clapper politician for
30 years or something.

1607
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,290
So we're kind of hamstrung by that.

1608
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:19,920
So if Ross,

1609
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,720
can you imagine Ross Perot is president?

1610
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:22,950
Because I think most people are like,

1611
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:23,531
yeah,

1612
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:24,331
I like what he's saying,

1613
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:26,640
but I can't imagine that little short,

1614
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,900
strange talking.

1615
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,180
We're going to clean out the
barn kind of guy being president.

1616
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,510
I think I would have imagined
he could have pulled it off.

1617
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:34,770
I think so.

1618
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:35,521
I wish you know,

1619
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:36,270
I mean,

1620
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:36,571
yeah,

1621
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:37,650
and you know what,

1622
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,491
to be honest,

1623
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:39,770
I don't know what kind
of president he'd be at.

1624
00:46:39,771 --> 00:46:41,610
My standards are just so low now.

1625
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:41,810
I mean,

1626
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,200
if they're honest,

1627
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,820
I'm on board mean forget about it.

1628
00:46:44,821 --> 00:46:46,700
And are there specific policies my,

1629
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:48,330
my take on it would be completely,

1630
00:46:48,331 --> 00:46:53,190
I mean it really would be all just
guesswork because I have no idea what the

1631
00:46:53,191 --> 00:46:56,310
hell happens when you
actually get into office,

1632
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,420
I guess.

1633
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,070
But I really have no idea what the
whole process must be like to say,

1634
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:03,030
when I'm president,

1635
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:03,990
I'm going to do this.

1636
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:09,140
And when you actually get elected and
then you have meetings and get access and

1637
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:14,250
get debriefed and they explain the world
to you in a way that really no one has

1638
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:15,630
access to other than the president.

1639
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:15,811
Sure.

1640
00:47:15,811 --> 00:47:18,640
You're not bypassing that moment at the
inauguration where they hit you up with

1641
00:47:18,641 --> 00:47:22,190
the needle and turn you into an
imaginary candidate and me go,

1642
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,010
go read a book.

1643
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,450
You go look at Obama's speeches.

1644
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:25,500
I tell everybody to go do this.

1645
00:47:25,501 --> 00:47:28,980
Go Watch candidate Obama's speeches
when he's running for the first term in

1646
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,340
office and compare

1647
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,550
that to what we've had and then
realize that that's pretty darn normal.

1648
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,810
The before and after thing,

1649
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,170
you do start to come to this
conspiratorial idea that some,

1650
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:38,381
you know,

1651
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:38,920
they go to Europe,

1652
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,080
they go to you right before your Noggin,

1653
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:40,330
racially,

1654
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,490
we're going to kill your whole
family if you don't do just what,

1655
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:43,860
you know what every other president does.

1656
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,970
Do you ever heard of the
Bill Hicks bit about it?

1657
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,060
No.

1658
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,510
Tell me about the buildings
up and his take was,

1659
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:50,201
he goes,

1660
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:50,411
uh,

1661
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:52,780
I think that when you
get become president,

1662
00:47:52,781 --> 00:47:57,100
they take you into a smoky room filled
with industrialists and it goes,

1663
00:47:57,101 --> 00:47:57,934
all right,

1664
00:47:58,570 --> 00:47:59,500
roll the tape.

1665
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:00,161
And he goes,

1666
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:04,180
and then a projector drops down and
they show you an angle of the Kennedy

1667
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,110
assassination.

1668
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:06,490
It's never been seen before.

1669
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,330
Perfect.

1670
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:08,980
And they say any questions?

1671
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:09,401
That's right.

1672
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:09,821
Exactly.

1673
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:10,120
It's like,

1674
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,340
yeah,

1675
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:10,540
Joe,

1676
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,530
what's my agenda?

1677
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:12,551
Well,

1678
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:15,370
I mean it's almost like an
Algebra problem when you try to

1679
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:19,900
plain all the reasons that these people
might morph so much after election day.

1680
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:20,921
Yeah,

1681
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:24,340
they'll start to start looking not that
far fetched because it's hard to explain

1682
00:48:24,341 --> 00:48:25,174
otherwise unless,

1683
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:30,010
unless these people just think campaign
promises or campaign promises and that's

1684
00:48:30,011 --> 00:48:30,281
all.

1685
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:30,881
And I and I,

1686
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:31,714
and I've been,

1687
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,100
I mean look Obama was,

1688
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,210
was the favorite of guys like Goldman
Sachs and Citibank when he was running for

1689
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:38,044
office.

1690
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:42,970
It's hard to square his agenda while
running that he talked to the people with

1691
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:44,710
the people that were providing the money.

1692
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,880
And so I think,

1693
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,880
I think maybe that has more to
do with it than anything else.

1694
00:48:48,881 --> 00:48:50,680
I mean we're not getting grassroots.

1695
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,980
You don't have Abbie Hoffman
running for president,

1696
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:54,491
you know?

1697
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:56,620
And if he was in Goldman
Sachs were backing him,

1698
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,500
I have a feeling he'd do the same thing.

1699
00:48:58,530 --> 00:48:58,711
Yeah.

1700
00:48:58,711 --> 00:49:03,711
His with the image that was being
portrayed was like nothing we'd ever seen

1701
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:04,591
before.

1702
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:05,100
It was like,

1703
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:05,790
oh okay.

1704
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:07,380
He actually is us.

1705
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:08,490
He is the misfit.

1706
00:49:08,491 --> 00:49:09,360
He is America.

1707
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:10,920
He is half black,

1708
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:11,790
half white.

1709
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,040
He is a raised by a single mom.

1710
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:14,521
He is,

1711
00:49:14,521 --> 00:49:14,791
you know,

1712
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:16,650
not from a silver spoon background.

1713
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,180
He's a persons cannot understand the

1714
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,230
constitutional law scholar.

1715
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:21,880
Remember all those to see,

1716
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:24,520
this is where the Obama
administration really angers me.

1717
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:29,290
It's not unusual to have some president
go off half cocked and do wild,

1718
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:32,770
crazy things like President
Bush did after nine 11 in fact,

1719
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:33,310
I'm,

1720
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,000
I'm kind of for,

1721
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,420
I kind of forgive those people a little
bit because I think it's unrealistic to

1722
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:42,010
expect us to have acted sane
after nine 11 as a matter of fact,

1723
00:49:42,011 --> 00:49:43,510
I've often said if we were smart people,

1724
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:48,511
we would put legislation in right now
mandating a cooling off period after the

1725
00:49:49,271 --> 00:49:53,470
next nine 11 so we don't legislate
while we're temporarily insane.

1726
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:56,500
I think the fact we don't do that shows
you that they'd like to legislate when

1727
00:49:56,501 --> 00:49:57,490
we're temporarily insane,

1728
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:00,280
but I think we were going to
go crazy when that happened.

1729
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,520
It's the responsibility of the next guy
though to get us back on track because

1730
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,550
if he doesn't,

1731
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,880
what was an anomaly becomes the new law
of the land when Obama from the other

1732
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:17,740
party running on a platform that he's
going to fix the abuses of the previous

1733
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:19,840
administration instead codifies them.

1734
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,640
That's the new reality.

1735
00:50:21,641 --> 00:50:23,290
Now that's not an anomaly.

1736
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,180
That's not an administration before him.

1737
00:50:25,181 --> 00:50:26,140
That was just different.

1738
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,980
This is new post nine

1739
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,020
11 world with both parties on board.

1740
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:34,760
How much say do you believe he
has and the day to day things?

1741
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:35,060
I mean,

1742
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,050
how much say does he have in
our foreign policy where we go,

1743
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:39,884
what we do?

1744
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:40,090
Well,

1745
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:43,070
it's interesting because this gets
back to a point we made earlier.

1746
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,400
Um,

1747
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,660
more than normal because of that whole
war time authority that we talked about

1748
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:47,901
earlier.

1749
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:48,291
First of all,

1750
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:51,470
presidents have more authority in
the realm of foreign policy anyway.

1751
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,640
That's always been considered.

1752
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,000
The reason presidents like to dabble
in foreign policies cause they have the

1753
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:56,930
most leeway there.

1754
00:50:56,931 --> 00:50:59,300
If they want to get into
budgetary things domestically,

1755
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,640
you start running into congressional
roadblocks all the time.

1756
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,360
So presidents,

1757
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,930
even when they're not foreign policy guys
liked to do foreign policy stuff cause

1758
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:09,590
you can actually do stuff and the congress
can't say much about it in war time.

1759
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,480
This guy has got amazing authority.

1760
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,620
I mean imagine using those same rationales
that they use anytime they want to do

1761
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:19,220
something with the war on terror but
using them for something totally.

1762
00:51:19,221 --> 00:51:19,550
Okay,

1763
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:22,820
we're going to stop this budget impasse
because we're in a war on terror and I

1764
00:51:22,821 --> 00:51:24,740
have supreme authority and I'm
just going to do what I want to do.

1765
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,360
What would anybody say?

1766
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:30,560
Nobody's talked about limiting
extreme more time authority at all.

1767
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:30,951
I mean,

1768
00:51:30,951 --> 00:51:31,940
if the Republicans are going to say,

1769
00:51:31,941 --> 00:51:32,391
well you know,

1770
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:33,740
you can't do that in war time.

1771
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:35,241
Well Gosh,

1772
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:35,691
it's nice.

1773
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:36,321
There's a line,

1774
00:51:36,321 --> 00:51:36,700
somebody,

1775
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,840
somebody who's designated
to limit to the powers,

1776
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:39,921
they don't do that.

1777
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:41,520
Now there's a book by um,

1778
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,690
a Yale constitutional law
professor named Bruce Ackerman,

1779
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:46,520
I think it's called the fall
of the American republic.

1780
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,010
And it's a little too
wonky for most people,

1781
00:51:49,011 --> 00:51:52,730
but what he's essentially done is
target what he thinks is the fly in the

1782
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:53,120
ointment.

1783
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,410
In terms of of these laws,

1784
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:57,140
and it's the presidential
office of legal counsel.

1785
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:59,180
It's essentially the president's lawyers.

1786
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:03,230
These were supposed to be people who
could answer the president's question,

1787
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:04,250
is this constitutional?

1788
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:05,330
Is it not constitutional?

1789
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:06,201
Instead,

1790
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:09,830
it's become the kind of people who
explained to the president how we can do

1791
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:10,221
something.

1792
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:11,300
That's who John you was.

1793
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:13,520
He was one of these people
with president would say,

1794
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,120
um,

1795
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,510
how do we do this and how do
we justify it constitutionally?

1796
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:20,420
And it was John used job to
go find out how to do that,

1797
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,230
right?

1798
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:26,120
Every president has these guys and what
what Ackerman was saying is by the time

1799
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:29,480
the supreme court gets around
to ruling on these things,

1800
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,920
it's often two,

1801
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,940
three terms.

1802
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:32,930
After that was first,

1803
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:35,000
and it's been the law of
the land for a long time.

1804
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:39,170
Now imagine the Supreme Court ruling
on something from 1994 and saying,

1805
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:41,150
everything we've done since 94 is wrong.

1806
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,470
You have to overturn it all.

1807
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,820
That doesn't tend to happen.

1808
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,720
And so the office of legal counsel can
make these rulings and there the law of

1809
00:52:47,721 --> 00:52:50,240
the land until they're challenged
and overturned by a court.

1810
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:53,090
By the time the court sees
that it's settled law,

1811
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:57,920
it seems to me we're in
like a system that is,

1812
00:52:57,921 --> 00:53:00,860
it's like compared to the
other day to an old car,

1813
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:06,050
it's like you can have a model t and
keep changing the oil and keep fixing.

1814
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:09,080
Things are in place in the parts
and it kind of keep working.

1815
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:10,580
It's gonna require a lot of work,

1816
00:53:10,581 --> 00:53:11,860
but it will sort of get you where you go.

1817
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,441
Got to go.

1818
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:16,730
Or You could buy a brand new Cadillac
and you're not going to have any fucking

1819
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:17,301
problems at all.

1820
00:53:17,301 --> 00:53:17,751
You know why?

1821
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:18,770
Because it's improved.

1822
00:53:18,771 --> 00:53:19,880
It's been redesigned.

1823
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:21,110
They've got all the kinks out,

1824
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:24,620
fixed the flaws and designed
a completely new thing.

1825
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,670
We don't have that in government.

1826
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,340
We have like this old
patchwork government.

1827
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,830
We have this old Wah,

1828
00:53:30,831 --> 00:53:31,260
Wah,

1829
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,110
Wacky I imperfect sort of system.

1830
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:34,591
What am I?

1831
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,450
Listeners brought up a
point that that that I,

1832
00:53:36,451 --> 00:53:37,380
that I thought of before,

1833
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,120
but I'd forgotten.

1834
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,060
And when you think about it,

1835
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:39,691
it's rather,

1836
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:40,010
um,

1837
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:40,151
it's,

1838
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:40,984
it's a good point.

1839
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:41,371
He said,

1840
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:42,204
not just that,

1841
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,540
it's a government designed
for a tiny country,

1842
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:46,111
you know,

1843
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:49,860
a one on one with 13 colonies
all on the east coast,

1844
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:50,311
you know,

1845
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:53,100
relatively homogenous and the whole thing.

1846
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:57,840
And you're expecting that
same system to work now.

1847
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,201
You know,

1848
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,030
you had 13 million
people then or something.

1849
00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:02,480
You have 300 million now with airplanes.

1850
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,340
Totally.

1851
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,960
Any Internet and globalization where
we're dealing with all these other

1852
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:07,830
countries in ways.

1853
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,191
I mean,

1854
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:11,610
we used to have two really
nice protective barriers,

1855
00:54:11,611 --> 00:54:15,000
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
that are not barriers at all now.

1856
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:15,871
So yeah,

1857
00:54:15,871 --> 00:54:16,471
so things,

1858
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:16,850
I mean,

1859
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:20,760
that sense you're expecting a system
designed in a completely different set of

1860
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:22,800
circumstances to adapt.

1861
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:22,921
Now,

1862
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:26,700
Thomas Jefferson said that that's why
the constitution was built to be amended.

1863
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:29,460
He said to expect a child to adjacent,

1864
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:32,850
to expect this constitution to
work as we wrote it forever,

1865
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:36,300
would be to expect a child to continue
to wear the same suit of clothes as they

1866
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:37,134
grow up.

1867
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,550
But there's a limit,

1868
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:39,001
right?

1869
00:54:39,001 --> 00:54:43,410
I mean at a certain point you
reach the stretching point maybe.

1870
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,920
And again if the legislators and all
those people were really acting in our

1871
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:47,754
interests,

1872
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,310
maybe they could make it work.

1873
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:54,540
But when you have them working at cross
purposes from us on a lot of this stuff

1874
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,980
that's asking too much.

1875
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,360
That's systemic failure.

1876
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:57,731
Yeah,

1877
00:54:57,731 --> 00:54:58,200
and when you,

1878
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:58,380
you,

1879
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:03,380
you get situations like corporations
having the ability to spend as much money

1880
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:08,810
as they like on candidates where you,

1881
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,840
you have no restriction in how much
money they can spend to influence someone

1882
00:55:13,891 --> 00:55:14,940
who gets into office.

1883
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,730
It's so transparent.

1884
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,300
It's like how does that ever
get to be the way we run things?

1885
00:55:21,301 --> 00:55:25,200
Cause it seems like that's the most
obvious method of bribery ever.

1886
00:55:25,201 --> 00:55:27,150
Well there's another one because
even if you got rid of that,

1887
00:55:27,151 --> 00:55:30,150
how do you stop this revolving
door that we see where they say,

1888
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,020
listen man,

1889
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,820
don't worry about it when
you get out of office.

1890
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:37,380
We got a nice cushy job at this defense
industry or whatever where you helped us

1891
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:37,651
out.

1892
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:38,970
We'll help you on the other side.

1893
00:55:38,971 --> 00:55:40,110
You'll be a very rich person.

1894
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:41,880
We see that all the time.

1895
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:42,810
How do you stop that?

1896
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,230
Did you hear about the guy who was the
head of Monsanto's now the head of the

1897
00:55:46,231 --> 00:55:47,064
FDA?

1898
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:47,731
Well,

1899
00:55:47,731 --> 00:55:48,390
it's like,

1900
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:48,541
oh,

1901
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:48,811
Bama.

1902
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:52,020
Just put another guy in the treasury
department that works for like city group

1903
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:53,310
or something and you turn around and go,

1904
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,730
it bothers me less than he did it.

1905
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:00,960
Then he doesn't mind that we saw he did
it in and everything that's gone on.

1906
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:01,794
I mean you don't even,

1907
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,210
that's when the gloves are off.

1908
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,070
We used to hide the corruption.

1909
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:06,240
Now it's so open.

1910
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:09,360
Nobody even cares and that that's
when you've reached a tipping point,

1911
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:09,820
I think.

1912
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:10,380
Yeah,

1913
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,191
that's ridiculous.

1914
00:56:11,191 --> 00:56:11,581
The open.

1915
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:15,330
That's just hoping that there's so much
going on all we just have to suck it up

1916
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:15,751
as people.

1917
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:16,920
We have nothing we could do.

1918
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:18,210
What do you,

1919
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:18,751
what are you going to do?

1920
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:19,710
Vote for Mitt Romney.

1921
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:19,981
I mean,

1922
00:56:19,981 --> 00:56:20,850
that's how it goes.

1923
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:21,480
Yeah.

1924
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,530
Well that was hilarious.

1925
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:23,230
It's like,

1926
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:23,690
what do you,

1927
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:24,160
you want to call

1928
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,510
it member or you want the same?

1929
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:26,371
I mean they,

1930
00:56:26,371 --> 00:56:29,770
they came up with one of the
weirdest candidates ever.

1931
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:30,550
A comp,

1932
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,331
a cult member,

1933
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:35,140
billionaire with obvious disdain for
the lower class and the working class.

1934
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,940
And what do you know what,

1935
00:56:36,941 --> 00:56:38,230
when was the last time though?

1936
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,340
I think that's almost a,

1937
00:56:39,341 --> 00:56:41,190
but you want to talk about
conspiracy theories that,

1938
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,700
that Oliver Stone can do a movie about.

1939
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:47,470
How about how we end up with these kinds
of elections were how often is it one

1940
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:51,030
guy that you'd like to replace
and another guy who's worse?

1941
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:51,340
Yeah,

1942
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,660
I mean you look at Bill Clinton,

1943
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:53,680
Bob Doll,

1944
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:54,783
you look at,

1945
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,290
I remember people forget this,

1946
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:58,300
we've lionized and
romanticized Reagan so much.

1947
00:56:58,301 --> 00:57:01,360
People forget that an 84 there's a lot
of people that would have gotten rid of

1948
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:01,721
Reagan.

1949
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:03,100
You remember who he ran against though?

1950
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,450
Walter Mondale.

1951
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:05,411
Talk about people.

1952
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:06,760
You can imagine president.

1953
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,740
I mean this happens all the time.

1954
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,150
How about Nick Nixon?

1955
00:57:10,151 --> 00:57:10,984
Humphrey,

1956
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:11,411
I mean,

1957
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:12,131
my God,

1958
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:12,580
you look at these,

1959
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,420
these are not this,

1960
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:16,290
this is like saying let's
have a good game of a,

1961
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:20,530
a paper view NFL and we'll put the
patriots up against some college team.

1962
00:57:20,531 --> 00:57:20,750
You know,

1963
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,300
I mean it's not even competitive.

1964
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:22,720
Yeah.

1965
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,360
Maybe a high school team there.

1966
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:26,490
You got the Mitt Romney's.

1967
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:28,121
Yeah.

1968
00:57:28,121 --> 00:57:28,470
Um,

1969
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:30,240
it is funny if you want to go crazy,

1970
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:31,890
Alex Jones conspiratorial,

1971
00:57:31,891 --> 00:57:35,010
he sort of a design a roadmap.

1972
00:57:35,011 --> 00:57:35,780
How they've decided,

1973
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,290
decided to keep certain presidents.

1974
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,840
They believe that that's one of the,

1975
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,970
that was one of the
problems with Ross Perot.

1976
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,230
I said Ross Perot is how Bill Clinton
got into office three way split.

1977
00:57:46,231 --> 00:57:46,531
Yeah.

1978
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:49,200
Because Ross Perot took away
from George Herbert Walker.

1979
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,140
Maybe.

1980
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,700
Maybe I can see that.

1981
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:53,800
Sure.

1982
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,210
But I remember a lot
of people at the time,

1983
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:56,600
uh,

1984
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,321
thinking like,

1985
00:57:57,321 --> 00:57:57,860
wow,

1986
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:58,220
uh,

1987
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,540
what are they going to do about this?

1988
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,450
Like he,

1989
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:03,800
this guy did the commission on
presidential debates up the bar.

1990
00:58:03,801 --> 00:58:04,680
I always try to tell people,

1991
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,100
do you realize that the debates used to
be run by the League of women voters?

1992
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,690
They got out of the Gig.

1993
00:58:09,691 --> 00:58:10,471
And the late eighties,

1994
00:58:10,471 --> 00:58:11,191
because the,

1995
00:58:11,191 --> 00:58:14,520
the rules that the Democrats
and Republicans wanted in
terms of controlling the

1996
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:16,020
debate and the questions
and everything else.

1997
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:16,891
They said,

1998
00:58:16,891 --> 00:58:18,900
well we won't run a debate
under those conditions.

1999
00:58:18,901 --> 00:58:20,850
And they expected the
other side to back down.

2000
00:58:20,851 --> 00:58:21,451
And the other side,

2001
00:58:21,451 --> 00:58:22,860
which were the two parties instead said,

2002
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,730
great,

2003
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,200
we didn't want to deal
with you guys anyway,

2004
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,490
we'll form our own commission,

2005
00:58:26,491 --> 00:58:27,950
will make up for members on it,

2006
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,350
will be Democrats for will be Republicans
and we'll set the standard for where

2007
00:58:31,351 --> 00:58:33,630
non Democrats or
Republicans can play a role.

2008
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:34,380
Um,

2009
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:38,310
Perot exceeded their original rules
and he was able to get enough of the

2010
00:58:38,311 --> 00:58:42,000
population and involvement in rise
enough in the polls because of his money.

2011
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:42,833
Like you said,

2012
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:44,520
to get in the debates.

2013
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,500
Nobody wanted him in the debates.

2014
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:47,170
Nobody likes,

2015
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:47,941
I mean they sweated.

2016
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,780
You remember it cause he brings up
things that are bipartisan failures.

2017
00:58:51,781 --> 00:58:53,790
And this is the rule of
the debates don't bring up.

2018
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:56,670
If the Democrats can't
tell the Republicans,

2019
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,210
you know,

2020
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:00,330
or the Republicans can't tell the
Democrats or blame them for something that

2021
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:01,590
they had nothing to do with.

2022
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:02,910
We don't talk about it.

2023
00:59:02,911 --> 00:59:03,271
The debt,

2024
00:59:03,271 --> 00:59:03,901
for example,

2025
00:59:03,901 --> 00:59:05,280
that was bit Perot's big issue.

2026
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,320
That's a bipartisan creation.

2027
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:09,660
So the two parties had no
reason to bring that up.

2028
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,550
You throw the third guy in there though.

2029
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,001
Oh,

2030
00:59:12,001 --> 00:59:14,970
he's going to make everybody sweat
because nobody has a good answer for

2031
00:59:14,971 --> 00:59:16,110
bipartisan failures.

2032
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:18,190
So after parole crash,

2033
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:18,691
the debates,

2034
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:22,010
the commission on presidential
debates upped the rules for

2035
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,340
inclusion and I went back
and did the history of it.

2036
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:29,000
Do you realize that there's never been a
candidate in American politics from any

2037
00:59:29,001 --> 00:59:33,440
third party or independent that's ever
come anywhere near their current bar that

2038
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:34,070
they've said?

2039
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,251
I mean,

2040
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:38,780
Teddy Roosevelt ran as a third party
candidate from the Bull Moose party after

2041
00:59:38,781 --> 00:59:40,520
he'd already been president.

2042
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:40,791
Right?

2043
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:44,300
A very popular president running
against two people that nobody wanted.

2044
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:49,110
He wouldn't have reached the benchmark
to be included in the modern presidential

2045
00:59:49,111 --> 00:59:49,310
third.

2046
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:49,580
You know,

2047
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,170
you're never going to
have a third party person,

2048
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:51,561
and again,

2049
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:53,900
it's 15% they raised it
to write more than that.

2050
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:55,370
You have to raise a
certain amount of money.

2051
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,720
You have to reach certain polls,

2052
00:59:56,721 --> 00:59:59,090
standards in a number of different polls,

2053
00:59:59,300 --> 00:59:59,901
and you have to,

2054
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:01,340
there's a name recognition thing.

2055
01:00:01,341 --> 01:00:01,590
I mean,

2056
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:05,530
it's a whole list of criteria in
that hilarious name recognition.

2057
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:05,721
Yes.

2058
01:00:05,721 --> 01:00:08,060
Before the debates is where
you get the name recognition.

2059
01:00:08,061 --> 01:00:08,540
That's right.

2060
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,440
Really quite cute.

2061
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:09,840
Yeah.

2062
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,820
I'm Gary Johnson.

2063
01:00:10,821 --> 01:00:11,600
Never had a chance.

2064
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,000
Oh,

2065
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,890
among other people.

2066
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:13,251
I mean,

2067
01:00:13,251 --> 01:00:13,461
you know,

2068
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:13,850
there's,

2069
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:14,540
listen,

2070
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,070
you're going to have to get a very rich,

2071
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:16,904
handsome,

2072
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,840
famous person to run and they're going
to still have to have all the breaks go

2073
01:00:20,841 --> 01:00:21,171
their way.

2074
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:23,840
They're gonna have to be running
against Walter Mondale and Bob Dole.

2075
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,710
So essentially they've legally
slapped it down to a two party system.

2076
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:29,180
There really is no third parties.

2077
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:32,720
What I like about it is I liked how
they both act as though it's in the

2078
01:00:32,721 --> 01:00:34,070
constitution somewhere.

2079
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,480
While we have a two party system.

2080
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:35,811
No,

2081
01:00:35,811 --> 01:00:36,231
we don't.

2082
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:37,070
Where'd you find that?

2083
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:37,460
That's a,

2084
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,420
that's a little propaganda
from the two party.

2085
01:00:39,421 --> 01:00:40,850
We don't have in any party system.

2086
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,560
The founders hated party,

2087
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:44,900
they called him factions
and they hated it.

2088
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,550
And it was like a generation later.

2089
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:47,180
There we are.

2090
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:47,301
Well,

2091
01:00:47,301 --> 01:00:51,980
when you have an issue like Bush to
Obama where you not only do you see very

2092
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:55,670
little change and how we operate
same foreign policy almost exactly.

2093
01:00:55,671 --> 01:00:55,971
Almost.

2094
01:00:55,971 --> 01:00:56,804
Exactly.

2095
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,330
But what is it then?

2096
01:00:59,331 --> 01:00:59,930
What are you,

2097
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,640
where's the change?

2098
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,200
Where's the change and where's the hope?

2099
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:06,230
And if there's only two parties and
you're both being funded by the same

2100
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:08,180
gigantic corporations and banks,

2101
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,343
whoa.

2102
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,030
Like what really has happened here?

2103
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:15,680
The late Gore Vidal said we have one
party in this country with two wings that

2104
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:17,480
represents 4% of the population.

2105
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:18,800
I mean that might be,

2106
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:19,910
it might be a little extreme,

2107
01:01:19,911 --> 01:01:20,041
but,

2108
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:21,650
but you start to see that way.

2109
01:01:21,651 --> 01:01:21,801
I mean,

2110
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:26,801
especially when you compare
what we consider to be left
and right to say Europe

2111
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:27,591
for example.

2112
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:28,010
I mean,

2113
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:28,431
first of all,

2114
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:31,010
our Republicans are to
the right of anything.

2115
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:31,581
You know,

2116
01:01:31,581 --> 01:01:34,160
almost there's a few fascist
parties in real weirdos in Europe.

2117
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:37,760
But we're to the right of anything like
that and our Democrats are to the right

2118
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:38,990
of most of their parties too.

2119
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:40,250
Well,

2120
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,083
you know,

2121
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:43,760
I have this conversation
with a good buddy of mine,

2122
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:48,200
Brian Callen all the time when we talk
about how crazy the world is today,

2123
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:51,080
but yet the greatest time to live ever.

2124
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,880
The safest time to live ever.

2125
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:54,380
The most prosperous time,

2126
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:54,930
the most.

2127
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:57,980
We're most technologically advanced time.

2128
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:02,060
When you look at today in
comparison to a thousand years ago,

2129
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:03,110
how brutal life was,

2130
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:03,531
or Geez,

2131
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:04,400
even a few hundred.

2132
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:04,551
Yeah.

2133
01:02:04,551 --> 01:02:05,840
Where would you want to go back to?

2134
01:02:05,841 --> 01:02:08,360
The dentistry alone would
keep you in the modern day.

2135
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:08,930
Yeah,

2136
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:09,501
I mean we,

2137
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:14,501
we have just this amazing potential as
we stand today with our technological

2138
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:15,951
abilities,

2139
01:02:15,951 --> 01:02:19,100
our internet connections are
ability to exchange information.

2140
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,040
We

2141
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,190
see hobbled only by our representation.

2142
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,870
It really does seem to be,

2143
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:28,260
if you look at how
advanced medicine is today,

2144
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,480
if you look at how advanced sciences,

2145
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:33,870
the incredible innovations
that are coming out every day,

2146
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:37,530
the one place where we're
disappointing is in our representation.

2147
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:38,260
You know,

2148
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,400
courage to me as you say that,

2149
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:40,721
you know,

2150
01:02:40,721 --> 01:02:41,081
maybe,

2151
01:02:41,081 --> 01:02:42,370
maybe you and I and,

2152
01:02:42,371 --> 01:02:45,820
and the people who think like
us are weird sort of minority.

2153
01:02:45,821 --> 01:02:46,420
Maybe you could,

2154
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:49,330
you could come up with this idea and
like I'm fleshing this out as we talk,

2155
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:52,990
but I mean maybe there's a way to look
at this outside our comfort zone where

2156
01:02:52,991 --> 01:02:53,890
people might say,

2157
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,101
you know,

2158
01:02:54,101 --> 01:02:56,220
if all you do is play video
games every day you go to Uta,

2159
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:57,453
who cares?

2160
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,450
Maybe they would say,

2161
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,350
well listen,

2162
01:02:59,350 --> 01:02:59,861
I mean,

2163
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:03,850
why do I care about the fact that the
government's corrupt and why do I care

2164
01:03:03,851 --> 01:03:04,870
that all of these things are going on?

2165
01:03:04,871 --> 01:03:05,950
And why do I care about drones?

2166
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,210
What does it matter to me?

2167
01:03:07,211 --> 01:03:09,580
I have the best life anybody's
ever had in all history.

2168
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,780
What am I missing?

2169
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,290
And I think that's where you get into
these arguments that we make about

2170
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,190
slippery slopes.

2171
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:15,401
Well,

2172
01:03:15,401 --> 01:03:15,821
hey man,

2173
01:03:15,821 --> 01:03:17,110
just cause you're happy today.

2174
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:17,530
You know,

2175
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:21,430
wait until a video game
players who download games
without permission or struck

2176
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:22,031
by drones.

2177
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:22,480
I mean,

2178
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:22,950
so,

2179
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:25,960
so I guess maybe there's a way to look
at it that there might be a lot of

2180
01:03:25,961 --> 01:03:26,351
people.

2181
01:03:26,351 --> 01:03:26,850
It's like,

2182
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:27,280
you know,

2183
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,860
brave new world territory that don't care.

2184
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,100
There was certainly are,

2185
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,400
I have my medical marijuana,

2186
01:03:33,401 --> 01:03:34,780
I have my video games.

2187
01:03:34,781 --> 01:03:34,991
I,

2188
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:35,231
uh,

2189
01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:35,561
you know,

2190
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,460
I have my days off,

2191
01:03:36,461 --> 01:03:38,500
I'm on my disability
payments and who cares?

2192
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:41,830
That's I think what infuriates people
about the whole hipster attitude.

2193
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:44,770
That's what infuriates
people about the attitude.

2194
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:44,921
Like,

2195
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:45,611
whatever,

2196
01:03:45,611 --> 01:03:46,361
who cares?

2197
01:03:46,361 --> 01:03:46,990
I'm not,

2198
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:47,351
you know,

2199
01:03:47,351 --> 01:03:48,220
I'm here for me.

2200
01:03:48,221 --> 01:03:49,480
I don't care about what's going on.

2201
01:03:49,481 --> 01:03:50,140
Whatever.

2202
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,430
Am I going to fix China?

2203
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:53,230
Am I going to Afghanistan?

2204
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:53,660
Uh,

2205
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:54,790
my own problems were with,

2206
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,030
I wasn't born into a society
of the day I created myself.

2207
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,110
It already existed.

2208
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,340
I'll just move forward.

2209
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,980
But I think as human beings,

2210
01:04:02,981 --> 01:04:07,300
we all ultimately realized that we're in
this together and that a lot of people

2211
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:12,301
had to exist before us that had the
better good of mankind in mind when they

2212
01:04:12,401 --> 01:04:14,350
developed computer chips,

2213
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,700
when they develop TVs,

2214
01:04:15,701 --> 01:04:16,840
when they develop cars,

2215
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,160
we didn't develop anything.

2216
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:19,780
We just sort of stumbled on.

2217
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:22,090
It's our job to do the same thing,

2218
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:25,750
to continue innovating as those
before us have innovated in every way.

2219
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,460
Whether it's socially,

2220
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,510
technologically,

2221
01:04:28,511 --> 01:04:29,470
or governmentally.

2222
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:29,950
We,

2223
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:30,290
we,

2224
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:34,900
we haven't governmentally it's The r
one area where we've really stalled.

2225
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:38,920
We really have in fact
slipped backwards and to a,

2226
01:04:38,921 --> 01:04:41,470
a goofy your system cause
it's more transparent.

2227
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:45,520
People are more upset than ever and
still government operates the same way.

2228
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:47,530
When we saw the bailouts,

2229
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:51,250
and I remember there was a speech where
Obama gave where he said he was limiting

2230
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:53,710
the bonuses of the CEOs to like,

2231
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:56,140
I was like a half a million dollars and a,

2232
01:04:56,141 --> 01:04:56,591
I was like,

2233
01:04:56,591 --> 01:04:58,210
this is the craziest,

2234
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:02,230
you're watching robbery take
place right before your eyes.

2235
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:05,530
And this guy who's the
representative of the people,

2236
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:09,490
this Obama character is letting you
know they're only going to rob a half a

2237
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,240
million dollars each.

2238
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:10,540
Like,

2239
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:10,961
Oh yeah,

2240
01:05:10,961 --> 01:05:11,231
yeah,

2241
01:05:11,231 --> 01:05:12,580
their company failed.

2242
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:17,610
But see they have a contract and even
though the bank didn't they all their

2243
01:05:17,721 --> 01:05:18,080
money,

2244
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:18,990
that guy gets money.

2245
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:20,570
Money is money.

2246
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,580
Money is I think what,

2247
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:22,221
what when we just,

2248
01:05:22,221 --> 01:05:22,640
you know,

2249
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,470
my little fly in the
ointment of this idea I had,

2250
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:28,370
I think the fact that it's going to be
very hard for a lot of Americans to make

2251
01:05:28,371 --> 01:05:32,780
a decent living is the most
likely thing to prompt change.

2252
01:05:32,781 --> 01:05:34,970
I remember in the 1990s and
I was doing my radio show,

2253
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:39,260
I was the worst radio show host in the
world for for the times cause like I was

2254
01:05:39,261 --> 01:05:43,190
on the station that had like these
conservative stereotypical radio hosts all

2255
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:43,400
day long.

2256
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,580
And then right in the middle of the day
part it was me and I didn't fit any of

2257
01:05:46,581 --> 01:05:46,851
these things.

2258
01:05:46,851 --> 01:05:50,060
So I fought with the audience all day
long because they were these hold overs

2259
01:05:50,061 --> 01:05:51,320
from the other conservative shows.

2260
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:53,270
And so I'm screaming and yelling about,

2261
01:05:53,271 --> 01:05:53,451
you know,

2262
01:05:53,451 --> 01:05:54,380
when are you going to
get out of the streets?

2263
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,120
When are you going to do something?

2264
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,320
Some guy called me up and
said something very prophetic.

2265
01:05:57,321 --> 01:05:58,370
I thought about it many times.

2266
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,204
He goes,

2267
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:03,020
people aren't going to go out and face
the bay and nets while they're able to

2268
01:06:03,021 --> 01:06:06,410
pay their bills and they have the food
they want and they can give their kids a

2269
01:06:06,411 --> 01:06:07,670
halfway decent life.

2270
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:09,890
He said when that changes,

2271
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,330
everything else will too,

2272
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,220
and you sit there and think about what,

2273
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:16,660
what's happened to middle
class jobs in this country.

2274
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:17,990
The so called middle class jobs,

2275
01:06:17,991 --> 01:06:20,570
it's a combination of
changes in trade deals,

2276
01:06:20,571 --> 01:06:21,560
which we all know about,

2277
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,090
but also automation,

2278
01:06:23,091 --> 01:06:25,100
which has gotten rid of a
lot of jobs that the Av,

2279
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,650
I always talk about them as
the average joes and Janes,

2280
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:32,060
people that don't have really high
expectations but they want to work.

2281
01:06:32,061 --> 01:06:35,480
They'll go to work and they raise a family
and maybe save up for college and you

2282
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,320
just make it work.

2283
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,400
A little shell game here and there,

2284
01:06:37,401 --> 01:06:38,420
but just a decent life.

2285
01:06:38,421 --> 01:06:39,740
That's the American dream,

2286
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:40,580
right?

2287
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,880
You take that away and maybe,

2288
01:06:43,881 --> 01:06:45,230
I mean when those video game,

2289
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:50,350
medicinal marijuana smoking hipster people
can't pay the bills and get evicted.

2290
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:54,410
Maybe that's the kind of wakeup call
that changes their belief system.

2291
01:06:54,411 --> 01:06:56,990
And maybe that's where you say we
live in the greatest time ever.

2292
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,011
Yeah.

2293
01:06:58,011 --> 01:07:01,100
Unless you're a black person in prison
because they caught you with a little

2294
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:02,540
cocaine or maybe less.

2295
01:07:02,541 --> 01:07:05,360
You're some guy that just got evicted
and your house is under water.

2296
01:07:05,361 --> 01:07:08,630
I mean those are the things that all
of a sudden make you and when you have

2297
01:07:08,631 --> 01:07:09,291
enough of those people,

2298
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,930
because nobody cares if
it's 1% of the population,

2299
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:16,550
if 40% of the population dropped from
what was the middle class into the lower

2300
01:07:16,551 --> 01:07:17,384
class,

2301
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:22,130
I think agitation hits an a level that
you and I in our lifetimes haven't seen.

2302
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:22,431
Well,

2303
01:07:22,431 --> 01:07:23,750
I think it's at a level now.

2304
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:24,610
I think it's on the way.

2305
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:25,031
Yeah.

2306
01:07:25,031 --> 01:07:26,560
Where we've never seen before.

2307
01:07:26,561 --> 01:07:28,280
And that's one of the things
that I was alluding to when,

2308
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:31,960
where it's what I was talking earlier
about the desire to understand history.

2309
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:35,050
I think that more people today,

2310
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:38,110
and at least the conversations that
I'm having based on my own personal

2311
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,920
experiences,

2312
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,820
more people are concerned with talking
about the corruptions of the past.

2313
01:07:42,821 --> 01:07:47,380
And why shouldn't we be surprised
or why should we be surprised?

2314
01:07:47,381 --> 01:07:49,480
There's so much fucked up shit
going on in politics today.

2315
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:49,870
Like,

2316
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:50,920
did you know this?

2317
01:07:50,921 --> 01:07:51,491
Did you know that?

2318
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:52,324
Like it's like,

2319
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:55,390
I think there's a lot of people that
are trying to figure out how the hell we

2320
01:07:55,391 --> 01:07:55,700
got,

2321
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:55,870
so

2322
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:56,381
that's,

2323
01:07:56,381 --> 01:07:58,570
you know what I was gonna you just
took the words out of my mouth.

2324
01:07:58,571 --> 01:08:01,150
The reason history is important
because it tells you how we got here.

2325
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:01,860
Yeah.

2326
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:02,050
My,

2327
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:03,010
I had a teacher wants to said,

2328
01:08:03,011 --> 01:08:03,350
look you,

2329
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:06,400
you joined a soap opera and you watch
the soap opera and you're going,

2330
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,270
who the hell is that?

2331
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:07,451
Why?

2332
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:08,620
Why are they mad at her and what?

2333
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:09,700
Who screwed who?

2334
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:10,121
I mean,

2335
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:11,290
that's what history teaches you.

2336
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:12,400
It gives you context.

2337
01:08:12,401 --> 01:08:13,510
You can understand the now.

2338
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:13,900
No,

2339
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,950
I think are the founding obviously

2340
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,820
had some awesome ideas and then we're
brilliant men and they were very well

2341
01:08:19,821 --> 01:08:20,390
schooled,

2342
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:25,390
but you can't possibly ask people from
1776 to figure out a way that's going to

2343
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:28,450
you.

2344
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:31,760
You're going to govern
people that exist in a time.

2345
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:36,310
You could even possibly imagine
the first people to say,

2346
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:36,720
absolutely,

2347
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,553
absolutely.

2348
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:38,241
Come on,

2349
01:08:38,241 --> 01:08:38,421
man.

2350
01:08:38,421 --> 01:08:41,820
I gave it to you to take care
of where are the whys high day,

2351
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:42,920
where autopilot,

2352
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:47,570
where are the wise men of today that
step forth and and and and make sense of

2353
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:50,890
the situation without need for you,

2354
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:51,950
with or without greed,

2355
01:08:51,951 --> 01:08:53,090
without corruption,

2356
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:53,301
where,

2357
01:08:53,301 --> 01:08:53,720
where are,

2358
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,290
where are they?

2359
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:58,580
Let me piggyback on that because I've
thought about that to look at the 1960s

2360
01:08:58,581 --> 01:09:00,200
which ha whatever you
may have thought about.

2361
01:09:00,201 --> 01:09:02,780
It was a period of change
in whatever direction.

2362
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:07,760
Look at how many people you can still
name if you have any knowledge at all that

2363
01:09:07,761 --> 01:09:10,610
were leading their own segments
of movements one way or the other.

2364
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:11,960
They had tons of people.

2365
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:14,360
Whether you want to talk about civil
rights in the Martin Luther kings and the

2366
01:09:14,361 --> 01:09:17,180
Malcolm x is whether you want to
talk about the yippies and all that.

2367
01:09:17,181 --> 01:09:18,014
What do you want to talk about?

2368
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:22,550
Everything had these people that step
forward that are on your Wikipedia page.

2369
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:23,384
If you want to go look up,

2370
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:25,430
who the hell does that today?

2371
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:30,610
Can you name two people who
are out front as political,

2372
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:31,041
you know,

2373
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:31,874
outside,

2374
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,020
outside politics,

2375
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:35,540
but people who lead movements and I can't,

2376
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:38,330
they've done an awesome job
of marginalizing those people.

2377
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:44,030
The government's way better at
preventing a Martin Luther King today.

2378
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:44,540
Um,

2379
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:44,991
yeah.

2380
01:09:44,991 --> 01:09:45,321
I mean,

2381
01:09:45,321 --> 01:09:49,310
today you have your obvious race
baiters like Jesse Jackson and you know,

2382
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:49,760
you have,

2383
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,391
that goes back.

2384
01:09:50,391 --> 01:09:50,810
I mean,

2385
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:51,650
is he still around?

2386
01:09:51,651 --> 01:09:51,891
And I mean,

2387
01:09:51,891 --> 01:09:53,180
that's when I was in college.

2388
01:09:53,181 --> 01:09:53,510
I mean,

2389
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:53,811
yeah,

2390
01:09:53,811 --> 01:09:57,260
constantly and constantly getting
called out for what he's doing with

2391
01:09:57,261 --> 01:10:00,290
corporations and forcing them
to pay enormous sums of money.

2392
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:03,020
And he goes in for a racial education,

2393
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,610
teaches people whenever they say,

2394
01:10:04,611 --> 01:10:04,910
I mean,

2395
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:07,430
essentially what he does is he
finds someone who's done something,

2396
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:11,660
either that could be racially distasteful
or said something that's out of line,

2397
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:13,130
even in a joke.

2398
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,020
And they go in and they blackmail him.

2399
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:15,920
But that's not a leader.

2400
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:18,080
That's just somebody who
found their own little scam.

2401
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:18,501
Who else?

2402
01:10:18,501 --> 01:10:19,190
Al Sharpton.

2403
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,200
Even worse guy.

2404
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:23,510
He started his whole career
off with a fake rape case.

2405
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,190
You know that Tijuana Brawley.

2406
01:10:25,191 --> 01:10:25,501
Yeah.

2407
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:26,000
Yeah.

2408
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,840
So that's,

2409
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:27,601
that's your,

2410
01:10:27,601 --> 01:10:27,950
uh,

2411
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:29,450
that's what they allow.

2412
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,600
They allow the most preposterous to exist.

2413
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,300
But again,

2414
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:36,080
those don't represent any of those kinds
of people from the 60s who legitimately

2415
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:36,914
believed.

2416
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:37,670
Um,

2417
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:38,870
and that's what's missing.

2418
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:42,830
And maybe you think it's because
we're cynical or it's our generation.

2419
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:43,191
I mean,

2420
01:10:43,191 --> 01:10:43,490
look,

2421
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,140
you and I are about the same age we come.

2422
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:46,460
Remember we were generation axe,

2423
01:10:46,461 --> 01:10:47,480
you're a bunch of slackers.

2424
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:48,410
And everybody was like,

2425
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:49,011
you know,

2426
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:49,311
oh,

2427
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:50,660
look of what this
generation is going to be.

2428
01:10:50,661 --> 01:10:51,530
And the funny thing is,

2429
01:10:51,531 --> 01:10:53,750
I think compared to generations after us,

2430
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:54,890
we look good.

2431
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:56,000
So what does that mean?

2432
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:57,290
If we're the slacker generation,

2433
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:58,310
the people that came after us,

2434
01:10:58,311 --> 01:10:59,000
or even more than,

2435
01:10:59,000 --> 01:10:59,833
I mean,

2436
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,180
are we reaping what we saw or oh,

2437
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:04,220
I'm not so happy with
what the baby boomers did.

2438
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:05,090
So who knows how that,

2439
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:05,860
you know,

2440
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:10,860
I think that this generation
that's growing up today
have this insane advantage

2441
01:11:11,451 --> 01:11:12,360
of the Internet from birth.

2442
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:12,651
Yes.

2443
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:13,380
They do.

2444
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:15,900
Imagine what those sixties people
would have done with the Internet.

2445
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:16,621
Oh yeah.

2446
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:16,930
I mean,

2447
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:20,730
w one of the things about the sixties
it's such a Trevon for so hard for people

2448
01:11:20,731 --> 01:11:25,140
to wrap their head around it was that
it was only 20 years after Hitler.

2449
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,210
And that's,

2450
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:28,223
that's a,

2451
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:29,940
when you put that in your head,

2452
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:32,040
I mean 20 years ago was what,

2453
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:34,380
nineties I do this all the time.

2454
01:11:34,381 --> 01:11:34,990
It's funny you say that.

2455
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:39,810
I remember I'm born in 65 that's 20
years after the Second World War.

2456
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:45,170
20 years ago I was at ABC
overhearing down ABC News.

2457
01:11:46,351 --> 01:11:46,591
I mean,

2458
01:11:46,591 --> 01:11:48,900
God hears is nothing anymore.

2459
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:49,890
That's Seinfeld.

2460
01:11:49,891 --> 01:11:51,690
Seinfeld was on the air in 93 right.

2461
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,711
So think about that.

2462
01:11:52,711 --> 01:11:53,820
That's so recent.

2463
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,080
That's the Holocaust.

2464
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:56,290
That is amazing.

2465
01:11:56,290 --> 01:12:01,290
So the people that lived in the sixties
were dealing with such a strange time,

2466
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:03,121
first of all,

2467
01:12:03,121 --> 01:12:07,770
the introduction of psychedelic drugs
into the community that had never existed

2468
01:12:07,771 --> 01:12:08,100
before.

2469
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:08,310
Right?

2470
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:12,030
LSD and the proliferation or did in
the late fifties with Huxley and those

2471
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,870
people and then and the,

2472
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:14,340
and the Kero acts and all that,

2473
01:12:14,341 --> 01:12:15,870
and then burst into mainstream.

2474
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,490
And unbeknownst to most folks,

2475
01:12:17,491 --> 01:12:21,930
even though marijuana has been illegal
in this country since the 1930s LSD

2476
01:12:21,931 --> 01:12:26,850
didn't become illegal until 1970
they pass this sweeping schedule,

2477
01:12:26,851 --> 01:12:29,160
one psychedelic act where they,

2478
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:32,250
they made everything
from pod to mushrooms,

2479
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,870
all these different
sacramental and few gins.

2480
01:12:36,871 --> 01:12:38,130
They made them all illegal.

2481
01:12:38,131 --> 01:12:41,790
They made them illegal then cause that
was the first time law enforcement around

2482
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:42,211
the country.

2483
01:12:42,211 --> 01:12:45,390
It was running into widespread
problems with it and they didn't know.

2484
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:48,840
There's a great drag net from the old
drag nets that are so funny to watch.

2485
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:49,861
The one,

2486
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:50,790
the one with blue boy,

2487
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:53,100
the most famous one ever is the,

2488
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:53,401
you know,

2489
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:56,130
those were were all based on
actual things and this was the,

2490
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:00,090
they find out people are using this brand
new drug called LSD and there's no law

2491
01:13:00,091 --> 01:13:00,540
against it.

2492
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:03,090
So immediately the first thing they had
to do is go find a new law that they can

2493
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:03,924
put into place.

2494
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,160
It's like I say today,

2495
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:09,120
the problem with our drug policy is that
we're not accounting for the fact that

2496
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:12,270
we might come up with some darn good
drugs that don't do as much damage as the

2497
01:13:12,271 --> 01:13:13,104
ones we have.

2498
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,560
Our policy will be to make whatever
new drug we find illegal tomorrow.

2499
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:17,610
If it intoxicates you,

2500
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:18,623
it's illegal.

2501
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,430
I don't know how much
longer that's going to work,

2502
01:13:20,431 --> 01:13:22,890
but if I was the government
trying to stamp out drugs,

2503
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,480
I think I'd just make better
drugs that competed with WWE.

2504
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:26,701
I mean,

2505
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:27,000
how do you,

2506
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,830
how do you get rid of bathtub gin?

2507
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:32,820
You get Bombay Sapphire and nobody
wants any bathtub gin anymore.

2508
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:33,511
Also,

2509
01:13:33,511 --> 01:13:35,130
you have to address what,

2510
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:38,700
what's being done with these drugs and
what's the effect because they've made no

2511
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:41,280
effort whatsoever to stop
things that turn you stupid.

2512
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:46,700
There's no effort whatsoever to slow down
oxycodone and oxy Maton vicodins well,

2513
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:47,910
math sort of.

2514
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:49,930
I mean they go after
and make you go crazy.

2515
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:50,371
Oh,

2516
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:50,881
I see what you're saying.

2517
01:13:50,881 --> 01:13:51,611
What I'm saying is the,

2518
01:13:51,611 --> 01:13:51,821
the,

2519
01:13:51,821 --> 01:13:52,210
the,

2520
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:52,800
the cover,

2521
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,820
the government is not trying
to stop a hydrocodone from,

2522
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:58,290
I think they are.

2523
01:13:59,300 --> 01:13:59,730
They're,

2524
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:00,060
they're,

2525
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,710
they're passing laws now that say,

2526
01:14:01,711 --> 01:14:02,340
um,

2527
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,840
oh there they're going
after the hydrocodone.

2528
01:14:03,841 --> 01:14:04,171
Tough.

2529
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:05,520
Now I'm brand new stuff.

2530
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:06,090
They're going to,

2531
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:09,150
you're not going to be able to call
in a prescription refill for that.

2532
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:12,220
You're going to have to have a physical
prescription now every time they're

2533
01:14:12,221 --> 01:14:14,250
going to crack down on that big they are,

2534
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,093
they are now.

2535
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:15,731
I was,

2536
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:16,300
um,

2537
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,250
I was in Florida recently and a,

2538
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:19,330
I'm thinking of hydrocodone.

2539
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:19,930
Yeah.

2540
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:22,000
I don't know if you know
the situation in Florida,

2541
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:22,791
they got a lot of the,

2542
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,081
the,

2543
01:14:23,081 --> 01:14:23,360
the,

2544
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,790
the prescription doctors there.

2545
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:25,121
Yeah.

2546
01:14:25,121 --> 01:14:29,110
They have pain management centers
and what a pain management center is.

2547
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:31,240
You go in and it's one building and like,

2548
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:34,420
like this office and that door
is the doctor you got hit me,

2549
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:35,650
I fuck my backup hurts.

2550
01:14:35,651 --> 01:14:36,490
Our calc can't sleep.

2551
01:14:36,491 --> 01:14:37,031
Okay,

2552
01:14:37,031 --> 01:14:37,930
here's some oxycontin.

2553
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,990
I guarantee you that five years
that will not be around guarantee.

2554
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:41,853
I bet you're right.

2555
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:46,180
One of the reasons why is because it's
been exposed and because there are time

2556
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:47,110
when he documentaries.

2557
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:47,990
Yeah.

2558
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:48,830
The um,

2559
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:49,340
the,

2560
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:50,980
those guys from current TV,

2561
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:52,090
I think it was current TV,

2562
01:14:52,091 --> 01:14:53,890
true to one of those fucking channels.

2563
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:55,390
Vanguard is this the,

2564
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:55,481
uh,

2565
01:14:55,481 --> 01:14:56,230
the show,

2566
01:14:56,230 --> 01:15:00,730
they had a show called the oxycontin
express and what they did was essentially

2567
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:05,020
they showed that there's a highway that
connects Florida to the rest of the

2568
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:05,411
country,

2569
01:15:05,411 --> 01:15:06,790
Ohio and Kentucky and Ohio.

2570
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:09,050
And these people just getting busted with,

2571
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:10,870
we're just going to say like Tennessee,

2572
01:15:10,871 --> 01:15:12,730
they just sit on the side
of the road and bust any,

2573
01:15:12,731 --> 01:15:13,070
yeah.

2574
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:13,540
Yeah.

2575
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:14,560
But here's the thing,

2576
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:16,300
I'm not convinced.

2577
01:15:16,301 --> 01:15:16,481
I mean,

2578
01:15:16,481 --> 01:15:17,314
when you look at,

2579
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,450
if you look at modern society and you say,

2580
01:15:19,451 --> 01:15:23,050
where have we made the most
technological advances,

2581
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:27,550
you would have to put pharmacology
in the top three or four areas,

2582
01:15:27,551 --> 01:15:27,761
right?

2583
01:15:27,761 --> 01:15:28,110
Yeah,

2584
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:28,530
sure.

2585
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:28,871
And when,

2586
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:29,081
when,

2587
01:15:29,081 --> 01:15:29,711
when for example,

2588
01:15:29,711 --> 01:15:33,460
when the Nazis wanted stuff to keep
their soldiers awake for things like,

2589
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:33,920
you know,

2590
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,370
unlimited blitzkrieg
attacks and fighter pilots,

2591
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,680
they would simply go to
the pharmacy companies a,

2592
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:39,491
here's what we need.

2593
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:40,330
And they'd produce it.

2594
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:43,540
If we were intelligent about this,

2595
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:47,980
we would say as Doctor Weil so
famously wrote 20 years ago,

2596
01:15:47,981 --> 01:15:50,260
people want to change their consciousness.

2597
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:55,650
Can't we arrange for substances that do
this in a more Safeway than the ones we

2598
01:15:56,951 --> 01:16:01,510
have that come with some pill that will
sober you up when it's time to drive

2599
01:16:01,511 --> 01:16:02,344
home?

2600
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:06,760
That's better than what we have now and
I guarantee you if you said the pharmacy

2601
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:07,091
companies,

2602
01:16:07,091 --> 01:16:07,601
and by the way,

2603
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:10,210
we'll give you the patent to
this for 20 years afterwards,

2604
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:14,860
they will come up with something
recreational better than anything we have,

2605
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:16,180
but because of an almost,

2606
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:20,560
I don't know if it's a puritan ethic
or if it's the companies that make the

2607
01:16:20,561 --> 01:16:23,500
current products that are legal that
don't want competition or whatever it is.

2608
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,600
Nobody even talks about this.

2609
01:16:25,601 --> 01:16:29,890
This is nothing drives me crazier about
the way we conduct things in American

2610
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:30,490
life.

2611
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,320
Then we don't even bring up subjects.

2612
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:35,530
I don't mind if we come up with the
wrong answer in a national debate on

2613
01:16:35,531 --> 01:16:36,364
something like this,

2614
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:38,140
but can we have the national debate?

2615
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:42,280
Can you come up and defend to me why
we shouldn't be working on safer,

2616
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:45,850
healthier alternatives if you're
going to make this drug illegal for

2617
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:46,780
recreational use,

2618
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:47,621
no problem,

2619
01:16:47,621 --> 01:16:51,430
but give me something that people can use
cause they want to use it that will do

2620
01:16:51,431 --> 01:16:52,450
something similar,

2621
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:56,350
will be less harmful to the individual
using it and less harmful to society.

2622
01:16:56,650 --> 01:17:01,650
I don't think that the government has
any plans whatsoever on either backing or

2623
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:07,180
or supporting any pharmaceutical
company that creates psychedelics.

2624
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,160
I think there's a big difference
between creating hydrocodone

2625
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:15,160
or creating a safer amphetamine or
creating safer drugs that allow us to

2626
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:18,530
continue to society as structured.

2627
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:22,190
When you start getting into things
like mushrooms and LSD and acid,

2628
01:17:22,191 --> 01:17:25,910
the real problem is the
boundary dissolving properties
are these things which

2629
01:17:25,911 --> 01:17:27,410
make you want to absolve.

2630
01:17:27,411 --> 01:17:29,840
Society made you want to
get rid of all the laws,

2631
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:33,680
makes you want to sleep naked and each
other's floors and do a lot of like

2632
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:36,980
culturally unsanctioned
shit and that creates chaos.

2633
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:38,570
And that created the chaos of the 60s.

2634
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:43,160
It was a paradigm shifting sort of a way
that people were looking at the world

2635
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:47,960
that was impossible for the
1950s minded cops to control.

2636
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:52,090
I think it's more of a difference
between medicinal and recreational.

2637
01:17:52,091 --> 01:17:54,010
And I don't think the authorities,

2638
01:17:54,011 --> 01:17:54,910
whoever that may be,

2639
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,520
have ever acknowledged
that besides alcohol,

2640
01:17:57,730 --> 01:17:59,770
there is any such thing as recreational.

2641
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:00,923
Um,

2642
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:05,950
unless you accept the idea in a free
society that may be people should be

2643
01:18:05,951 --> 01:18:07,450
allowed to use recreational stuff.

2644
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,920
I used to say there ought to be a system,

2645
01:18:08,921 --> 01:18:09,580
a test,

2646
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:10,180
right?

2647
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:12,520
And it should be something
like a hundred questions.

2648
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:13,871
Question number one,

2649
01:18:13,871 --> 01:18:15,490
how likely is it to be addicting?

2650
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:16,151
Question number two,

2651
01:18:16,151 --> 01:18:17,010
how dangerous is it?

2652
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,490
Everything should pass this test.

2653
01:18:18,491 --> 01:18:20,620
And if you get above or below,

2654
01:18:20,621 --> 01:18:21,454
I don't know how it works.

2655
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:22,323
A certain score,

2656
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,110
you're legal.

2657
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:23,740
If you don't,

2658
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,910
you're illegal and you,

2659
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:27,100
you put the current drugs
that are legal on there too.

2660
01:18:27,101 --> 01:18:28,030
You put alcohol on there,

2661
01:18:28,031 --> 01:18:30,010
put caffeine on it and
let's see how it scores.

2662
01:18:30,011 --> 01:18:33,070
Do you really think marijuana is going
to fail that test and alcohol is going to

2663
01:18:33,071 --> 01:18:33,904
pass.

2664
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:34,300
Um,

2665
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:34,451
if,

2666
01:18:34,451 --> 01:18:35,320
like I said to you before,

2667
01:18:35,321 --> 01:18:39,850
if somebody invents the perfect drug
tomorrow in some bath tub somewhere,

2668
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:43,180
our government's going to ban it the
day after tomorrow with no testing,

2669
01:18:43,181 --> 01:18:44,140
no questions asked.

2670
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,270
Just on the grounds
that it's recreational,

2671
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:48,070
you're not allowed to have
any recreational drugs.

2672
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:52,160
Not only recreational is there's an
issue with things being recreational,

2673
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:53,003
Zo things,

2674
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,160
anything performance enhancing,

2675
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,200
you know,

2676
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:56,831
pro vigil.

2677
01:18:56,831 --> 01:18:57,601
Do you know what pro vigil,

2678
01:18:57,601 --> 01:19:02,240
I don't know what pro vigil is like
the latest smart drug rage amongst the

2679
01:19:02,241 --> 01:19:03,970
silicon valley set and it's a,

2680
01:19:03,971 --> 01:19:08,090
it's very odd stimulant that I'm
not qualified to describe them.

2681
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:10,700
The mechanics and the
mechanism behind what it does.

2682
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:13,760
But what it does is it gives
you this sort of stimulated,

2683
01:19:13,761 --> 01:19:16,970
accelerated feeling without
feeling like you're on speed.

2684
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:18,560
Your heart rate doesn't go up,

2685
01:19:18,561 --> 01:19:19,394
you don't get jittery.

2686
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:20,351
What's the action?

2687
01:19:20,351 --> 01:19:20,561
How's,

2688
01:19:20,561 --> 01:19:20,890
how's it,

2689
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,730
what's it do?

2690
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:22,350
Does it,

2691
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:22,680
is it,

2692
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,750
is it an amphetamine thing or no,

2693
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,440
it's a new thing.

2694
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,680
[inaudible] vitamin that just,

2695
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:27,050
no,

2696
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:27,251
no,

2697
01:19:27,251 --> 01:19:27,431
no.

2698
01:19:27,431 --> 01:19:28,480
It's much more intense.

2699
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:29,230
It's Brian,

2700
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:30,220
you've experienced it.

2701
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:30,761
Yeah.

2702
01:19:30,761 --> 01:19:30,941
I mean,

2703
01:19:30,941 --> 01:19:31,111
I,

2704
01:19:31,111 --> 01:19:34,720
I was trying to zero sleep and
I had to drive to San Diego.

2705
01:19:34,721 --> 01:19:34,901
I mean,

2706
01:19:34,901 --> 01:19:38,140
I could barely keep my eyes open and I
took it and just immediately I was like,

2707
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:38,291
oh,

2708
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:38,950
I'm awake.

2709
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:39,783
Okay.

2710
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,073
Clear.

2711
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,890
Do you know what it is or do
you just take it sight unseen?

2712
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:45,480
Well,

2713
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,313
you got it from me.

2714
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,551
I take anything.

2715
01:19:47,551 --> 01:19:48,880
I gave it to him because I didn't want to.

2716
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:51,430
We have to have a laboratory situations.

2717
01:19:51,431 --> 01:19:51,551
He's,

2718
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:51,880
yeah.

2719
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:52,270
Um,

2720
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:52,931
well let me,

2721
01:19:52,931 --> 01:19:53,230
um,

2722
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:56,350
let me find the exact mechanism behind it.

2723
01:19:56,351 --> 01:19:56,681
So,

2724
01:19:56,681 --> 01:19:56,930
uh,

2725
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:57,760
is it legal?

2726
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,061
Yes,

2727
01:19:58,061 --> 01:19:58,450
absolutely.

2728
01:19:58,450 --> 01:20:01,630
Is it legal because they just haven't
gotten around the band question

2729
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,100
it.

2730
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:03,940
Here's rather the,

2731
01:20:03,941 --> 01:20:04,021
uh,

2732
01:20:04,021 --> 01:20:04,854
the issue.

2733
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,680
It's a Pr,

2734
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,250
it was created essentially to

2735
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,200
enhance mental performance and clarity.

2736
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,153
However,

2737
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,930
to get it as a prescription drug,

2738
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,240
you can't have something
that just makes you better.

2739
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:15,901
You have to,

2740
01:20:15,901 --> 01:20:16,980
something wrong with you.

2741
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,240
So they had to say,

2742
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,080
uh,

2743
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:19,920
narcolepsy,

2744
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:21,443
narcolepsy.

2745
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,040
It's the narcolepsy.

2746
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:23,760
Absolutely.

2747
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,630
I'm not bullshitting.

2748
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:25,210
This is,

2749
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:27,510
it's how do you prove you have narcolepsy?

2750
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:28,490
I don't know,

2751
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,930
for the doctor's office and
just shamelessly shift work,

2752
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:35,460
sleep disorder and excessive daytime
sleepiness associated with obstructive

2753
01:20:35,461 --> 01:20:36,181
sleep apnea,

2754
01:20:36,181 --> 01:20:36,780
which by the way,

2755
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:39,000
I have sleep app and it
is not an amphetamine.

2756
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:39,211
No,

2757
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:39,810
it is not,

2758
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:41,690
despite extensive research
into the interaction,

2759
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:43,080
it's called Modafinil.

2760
01:20:43,081 --> 01:20:47,220
That's the actual chemical name with a
large number of neurotransmitter systems.

2761
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:47,761
That precise,

2762
01:20:47,761 --> 01:20:51,000
precise mechanism or
mechanisms of action remain.

2763
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:53,760
I was going to be a dopamine
serotonin kind of thing,

2764
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:54,630
but it doesn't crash.

2765
01:20:54,631 --> 01:20:55,620
You don't crash afterwards.

2766
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:58,140
It elevates hypothalmic histamine levels,

2767
01:20:58,350 --> 01:20:58,530
uh,

2768
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:03,090
leading some return researchers to
consider that Modafinil is a wakefulness

2769
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:06,720
promoting agent rather than a
classic amphetamine like Stimuli.

2770
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,130
Are they using it on the street yet?

2771
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:09,151
Oh yeah.

2772
01:21:09,151 --> 01:21:09,451
Well,

2773
01:21:09,451 --> 01:21:09,961
for sure.

2774
01:21:09,961 --> 01:21:11,400
And people in school,

2775
01:21:11,401 --> 01:21:13,200
people in startups,

2776
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,630
people that are forced to
work long hours on casters,

2777
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:16,740
podcasters.

2778
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:19,770
It can if you're exhausted
and you had to take a,

2779
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:20,220
uh,

2780
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:22,530
like if you had to do
something to try to wake up,

2781
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,260
it's amazing what the fungus
free coffee doesn't work anymore.

2782
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:26,850
So let me ask you this.

2783
01:21:26,851 --> 01:21:30,210
What's the penalty for being caught
with this stuff without a prescription?

2784
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:31,020
Well,

2785
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,420
being caught with any chemical,

2786
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:36,450
the w the prescription is a misdemeanor,

2787
01:21:36,451 --> 01:21:36,810
right?

2788
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:37,350
Isn't it?

2789
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:39,750
Depending on how much you have
and what the prescription is,

2790
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:40,111
yeah,

2791
01:21:40,111 --> 01:21:41,160
you have to have a prescription,

2792
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:42,540
but you can get one.

2793
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:42,841
You know,

2794
01:21:42,841 --> 01:21:46,440
you can just say you're tired
and you'd get one sleep apnea.

2795
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:47,131
How can we,

2796
01:21:47,131 --> 01:21:48,330
I mean if you said,

2797
01:21:48,331 --> 01:21:50,070
think about how you would
change the country if you said,

2798
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:50,904
listen,

2799
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:51,660
there's,

2800
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:52,080
again,

2801
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,880
getting back to my Joe
Friday dragnet thing,

2802
01:21:53,881 --> 01:21:55,950
cause this is apparently how I
learned about all this as a youth.

2803
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,230
I remember the marijuana episode where,

2804
01:21:58,350 --> 01:21:59,880
where the guy is that the family man,

2805
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:00,580
remember the one where he,

2806
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:02,610
his child dies in the bathtub later.

2807
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:05,730
We're where he's trying to argue with Joe
Friday about why there's nothing wrong

2808
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:06,330
with marijuana.

2809
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:07,020
He says,

2810
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:07,321
he says,

2811
01:22:07,321 --> 01:22:07,531
well,

2812
01:22:07,531 --> 01:22:08,100
it's less,

2813
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,340
less effective than alcohol.

2814
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:09,640
It doesn't,

2815
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:10,350
doesn't bother you,

2816
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:10,561
Joe.

2817
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:11,160
Friday says,

2818
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,900
but look at all the
problem alcohol causes.

2819
01:22:12,901 --> 01:22:15,000
Do we really need another
drug that does that?

2820
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:16,860
I think that's how they think.

2821
01:22:16,861 --> 01:22:19,560
I think they think that you're going
to increase and they might be right.

2822
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:20,850
Try to fatalities.

2823
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:23,760
I think a the wrong and B,

2824
01:22:23,761 --> 01:22:26,150
they don't really think that everything
we've said here is about how they're

2825
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:26,611
wrong.

2826
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:27,000
So,

2827
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:27,160
well,

2828
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:27,451
I don't,

2829
01:22:27,451 --> 01:22:30,510
I don't believe they're right about
chain about traffic fatalities.

2830
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:32,580
I think people are safer
drivers when they're high.

2831
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:33,900
I think they drive slower.

2832
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:34,651
They're more aware,

2833
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:36,810
especially if they smoked
pot on a regular basis.

2834
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,540
It might depend on how high oh yeah.

2835
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:39,811
Oh,

2836
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:40,644
for sure.

2837
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:41,670
I mean obliterated.

2838
01:22:41,671 --> 01:22:44,310
You can get obliterated toward the
point where it's reality dissolving.

2839
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,050
I think if you legalize marijuana,

2840
01:22:46,051 --> 01:22:47,280
I think you would see more.

2841
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:47,540
Uh,

2842
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:47,680
I,

2843
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,530
I think it's almost unequivocal.

2844
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:50,281
You would see more,

2845
01:22:50,281 --> 01:22:50,730
uh,

2846
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:51,350
what would you call it?

2847
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:53,070
Nom Ui is what would you even know?

2848
01:22:53,071 --> 01:22:54,780
And I think you'd say more merging,

2849
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:55,780
more waving.

2850
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:57,510
Both allow you to merge.

2851
01:22:57,511 --> 01:22:58,410
You might listen to that.

2852
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:01,110
There's no question that this
stuff would come with a cost.

2853
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:01,861
The question is,

2854
01:23:01,861 --> 01:23:05,500
is the cost that you would pay
worse than what we have now?

2855
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:07,180
I don't agree that it
would come with a cost.

2856
01:23:07,181 --> 01:23:10,960
I think it would be beneficial
to society as far as a relaxing.

2857
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:14,380
I think if there's anything that
society needs right now is a change of

2858
01:23:14,381 --> 01:23:15,070
perspective,

2859
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:18,460
something to calm them down and more
creativity and those are three things that

2860
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:19,294
are promoted by her.

2861
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,920
I think you're speaking as a guy who's,

2862
01:23:20,921 --> 01:23:22,030
who's experienced with this,

2863
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:25,660
I think remember what it's love for what
you get kids first starting out with

2864
01:23:25,661 --> 01:23:26,494
this stuff.

2865
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:28,150
I look well,

2866
01:23:28,151 --> 01:23:29,680
kids should be educated.

2867
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:30,191
Everything.

2868
01:23:30,191 --> 01:23:32,800
One of the thought of the problems with
kids starting out with this stuff is

2869
01:23:32,801 --> 01:23:34,660
that they're going into
it in an ignorant way,

2870
01:23:34,661 --> 01:23:36,940
experimenting on their own
and no one knows what the,

2871
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:38,740
what the effects are going to be.

2872
01:23:38,741 --> 01:23:42,130
No one knows what to expect because
how every kid gets understanding about

2873
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:42,641
alcohol.

2874
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:45,970
I mean it's going to be a similar kind
of a learning curve down my now my kids,

2875
01:23:45,971 --> 01:23:46,690
I teach them,

2876
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:47,890
I speak to,

2877
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:49,330
to drink,

2878
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:51,160
well I don't let them drink,

2879
01:23:51,161 --> 01:23:51,994
but I speak,

2880
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,050
but I have a 16 year old and I
talked to her about alcohol varies.

2881
01:23:56,051 --> 01:23:56,884
What do you say?

2882
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:57,311
Well,

2883
01:23:57,311 --> 01:23:57,821
first of all,

2884
01:23:57,821 --> 01:23:58,720
I tell her whenever,

2885
01:23:58,721 --> 01:23:59,310
whenever we have

2886
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:00,570
conversations about anything,

2887
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:04,380
one of the most important things that I
bring up is all the things that I fucked

2888
01:24:04,381 --> 01:24:05,214
up.

2889
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:06,570
They don't care about data.

2890
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:07,571
Oh,

2891
01:24:07,571 --> 01:24:08,520
of course they do.

2892
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:09,310
How many do you have kids?

2893
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:09,541
Yeah,

2894
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:09,840
two.

2895
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:10,090
Two.

2896
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:10,820
How old are they?

2897
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:13,010
11 and eight when I,

2898
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,260
when?

2899
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:14,220
When I was a kid,

2900
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,960
one of the things that I remember
more than anything was a,

2901
01:24:16,961 --> 01:24:18,120
I have a really cool uncle,

2902
01:24:18,121 --> 01:24:18,750
uncle Vinny,

2903
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,670
and one of the things that he would eat,

2904
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:22,170
it seems like you believe uncle Vinny,

2905
01:24:22,171 --> 01:24:24,180
but he's actually an artist
with long haired Hippie.

2906
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:24,960
Um,

2907
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,620
he,

2908
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:27,690
when he would talk to me about things,

2909
01:24:27,691 --> 01:24:29,040
he would always talk to me.

2910
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,750
Like if I did anything wrong,

2911
01:24:30,751 --> 01:24:32,760
it was always what he did,

2912
01:24:32,761 --> 01:24:34,320
how he fucked up first.

2913
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:36,120
My father's famous line was do as I say,

2914
01:24:36,121 --> 01:24:36,790
not as I do.

2915
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:37,770
He was a film maker.

2916
01:24:37,771 --> 01:24:38,250
So,

2917
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:38,401
oh,

2918
01:24:38,401 --> 01:24:39,234
that's funny.

2919
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:44,260
What I learned a lot listening to this
guy tell him and I remember thinking like

2920
01:24:44,581 --> 01:24:45,960
that like he did.

2921
01:24:45,961 --> 01:24:50,190
He kept me from being on the defensive
by explaining to me that it's just part

2922
01:24:50,191 --> 01:24:52,710
of human nature to fuck
up and to make mistakes.

2923
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:54,660
And because he was so honest about that,

2924
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:56,640
I would listen to all of his advice,

2925
01:24:56,641 --> 01:24:57,780
whether it's about alcohol,

2926
01:24:57,781 --> 01:24:58,800
whether it's about whatever.

2927
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:04,100
And I think the most important thing
you can give to a kid is information and

2928
01:25:06,031 --> 01:25:06,570
love.

2929
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:08,550
And the only way they're
going to accept it as it,

2930
01:25:08,551 --> 01:25:09,384
they trust you.

2931
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,940
And the only way they're going to trust
you is if you're a hundred percent

2932
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:13,320
honest with them all the time.

2933
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:14,100
And you just,

2934
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,780
you don't play any
bullshit games with them.

2935
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:16,950
And you explained to them,

2936
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:19,080
and even not just not just honest,

2937
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:21,600
but you got to explain to them all
the times you fucked up as well.

2938
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,080
So what do you do if I saw something the
other day where Snoop Dogg is smoking

2939
01:25:26,081 --> 01:25:27,250
weed with his kid?

2940
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:28,653
What about that?

2941
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:29,440
Well,

2942
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,221
how old's his kid?

2943
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:30,700
First of all,

2944
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,230
I don't know the answer to the question.

2945
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,570
I mean if his kids a dog man,

2946
01:25:34,571 --> 01:25:34,811
that is,

2947
01:25:34,811 --> 01:25:35,501
that is right there.

2948
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:37,470
The limit of my knowledge already.

2949
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:39,610
So I'm off in the deep end here already.

2950
01:25:39,611 --> 01:25:40,540
I think the younger the better.

2951
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:42,430
I think stone kids or would be awesome.

2952
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:44,230
It's actually not good for your divine.

2953
01:25:44,231 --> 01:25:44,981
I was just going to say,

2954
01:25:44,981 --> 01:25:48,460
I'm living up in Oregon where there's
a whole generation of kids that were on

2955
01:25:48,461 --> 01:25:52,840
Lsd from like five years old and he
turns you into Courtney love without the

2956
01:25:52,841 --> 01:25:53,860
creative Portland,

2957
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:55,690
Eugene gene.

2958
01:25:55,691 --> 01:25:56,350
Okay.

2959
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:58,390
Portland look conservative does,

2960
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:00,160
it does make fun of the conservative.

2961
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,540
That's Hippieville central.

2962
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:01,931
But God,

2963
01:26:01,931 --> 01:26:03,200
it's a beautiful country up there

2964
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,761
from here.

2965
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:05,391
So I mean,

2966
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:06,590
coming back here is like,

2967
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:07,011
you know,

2968
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:08,510
I was telling my mom just today,

2969
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:09,080
um,

2970
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,800
this town feels claustrophobic to me.

2971
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:11,510
You know,

2972
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:15,170
we have like nine buildings where they
used to have one on a lot and you just

2973
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:16,280
feel like,

2974
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:16,551
I mean,

2975
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:16,611
I,

2976
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:18,830
I need some outdoors areas.

2977
01:26:18,831 --> 01:26:20,060
You've got to go to the beach.

2978
01:26:20,061 --> 01:26:20,511
Yeah.

2979
01:26:20,511 --> 01:26:22,940
You don't realize how s smothered yard.

2980
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:25,010
This town used to be
a great place to live.

2981
01:26:25,011 --> 01:26:25,581
No offense.

2982
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:26,420
A Angelenos.

2983
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:27,390
It's still great.

2984
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:28,860
It's just too big and crazy.

2985
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:30,960
I live a little bit further out,

2986
01:26:30,961 --> 01:26:31,331
but I,

2987
01:26:31,331 --> 01:26:32,730
I want to move even further out.

2988
01:26:32,731 --> 01:26:32,881
I've,

2989
01:26:32,881 --> 01:26:35,220
I've actually been looking
at Santa Barbara lately.

2990
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:37,410
I really like is called
in Santa Barbara though.

2991
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:38,490
I'm not scared of the cold.

2992
01:26:38,491 --> 01:26:39,420
I grew up in Boston.

2993
01:26:39,421 --> 01:26:40,650
This is called is for pussies.

2994
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:42,173
Boston's really bad.

2995
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,330
That's brutality.

2996
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:43,990
You're right.

2997
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:44,640
Um,

2998
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:45,600
where were we at?

2999
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:45,721
Oh,

3000
01:26:45,721 --> 01:26:47,820
we were talking about them making drugs,

3001
01:26:47,821 --> 01:26:48,510
legal,

3002
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:52,770
that the idea is that it's a personal
freedom issue and the personal freedom is

3003
01:26:52,771 --> 01:26:53,604
you're a man.

3004
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,630
I should not be able to,

3005
01:26:54,631 --> 01:26:56,190
if it was only two people on the planet,

3006
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:57,030
just you and me.

3007
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:57,511
And I said,

3008
01:26:57,511 --> 01:26:57,631
well,

3009
01:26:57,631 --> 01:27:00,120
I've made a law and the law is no alcohol.

3010
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:00,721
You know,

3011
01:27:00,721 --> 01:27:01,051
he'd be like,

3012
01:27:01,051 --> 01:27:02,310
what the fuck are you talking about?

3013
01:27:02,311 --> 01:27:03,810
There's only two of us
and I want to drink.

3014
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:04,270
You know,

3015
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:04,351
well,

3016
01:27:04,351 --> 01:27:06,480
I'm going to lock you in a
cage if you drink the alcohol.

3017
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:07,770
It sounds preposterous,

3018
01:27:07,771 --> 01:27:11,160
but it's just as preposterous
for 3000 people to,

3019
01:27:11,161 --> 01:27:11,520
to,

3020
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,490
to tell 300 million people
that they can't have pot.

3021
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:14,721
Well,

3022
01:27:14,721 --> 01:27:15,860
here's the difference to me,

3023
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:18,260
what's the difference
between locking somebody up,

3024
01:27:18,261 --> 01:27:22,460
you find with the drug than locking
somebody up who does something they

3025
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:24,080
shouldn't be doing when
they're on the drug?

3026
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:26,540
I mean hold them
accountable and responsible.

3027
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:28,790
Then we're still going to have
a ton of people in prison,

3028
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:30,380
but they're not going to be
in prison for possession.

3029
01:27:30,381 --> 01:27:32,450
They're going to be in prison
for doing something that,

3030
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:33,230
you know,

3031
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:36,980
you go back to the old west and one of
the standard stump speeches that the

3032
01:27:36,981 --> 01:27:39,890
person they were about
to hang would give you.

3033
01:27:39,891 --> 01:27:40,540
The guy you know,

3034
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:41,241
was about to hang,

3035
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:41,990
would always feel,

3036
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:42,381
not always,

3037
01:27:42,381 --> 01:27:45,740
but a lot of times feel like they needed
to give some sort of lesson to the kids

3038
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:46,790
and they'd say something like,

3039
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:46,881
well,

3040
01:27:46,881 --> 01:27:49,850
you need to do avoid alcohol and
don't end up like I ended up.

3041
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:50,450
And that was,

3042
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:50,631
you know,

3043
01:27:50,631 --> 01:27:51,464
that kind of thing.

3044
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:52,370
Look,

3045
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:53,270
that's going to happen.

3046
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:54,380
Then there's no question that,

3047
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:55,530
that I think it,

3048
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:58,190
whether it's alcohol or anything else
that's going to lead some people to

3049
01:27:58,191 --> 01:27:58,461
straight,

3050
01:27:58,461 --> 01:27:59,630
they call it a gateway drug.

3051
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,600
Anything as a gate with the first
thing you use is a gateway drug.

3052
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,831
At the same time,

3053
01:28:03,831 --> 01:28:08,831
we punish people now for the potential
that they might do with the illegal drug

3054
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,530
if you punish him for the actuality.

3055
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:15,710
I'm not sure it's any less
effective than what we have now.

3056
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:17,960
And you increase the
overall freedom level.

3057
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:18,890
Um,

3058
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:19,161
you know,

3059
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:19,371
the,

3060
01:28:19,371 --> 01:28:23,450
the idea that the founders had that we
ought to use the states as laboratories.

3061
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:26,240
This is where you get to the
marijuana situation right now.

3062
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:30,170
I would love for states to be
able to actually try this out.

3063
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:31,940
Instead of us having to have a national,

3064
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:32,690
um,

3065
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:33,523
experiment,

3066
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:33,741
you know,

3067
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:35,540
where everybody's sinks or swims together.

3068
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:40,310
Let Colorado try this weed thing
out and let's see how it goes.

3069
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:43,250
I don't think the feds are
going to let this really happen.

3070
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:43,760
Um,

3071
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,190
but to me that's the
intelligent way to do it.

3072
01:28:46,191 --> 01:28:49,570
What do you think's going to happen with
Seattle or Washington is going to be a,

3073
01:28:49,571 --> 01:28:51,850
there's going to be a
showdown point and they're,

3074
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:52,641
first of all,

3075
01:28:52,641 --> 01:28:54,410
the Fed's already aren't
letting this happen.

3076
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,040
I mean,

3077
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,311
you know,

3078
01:28:55,311 --> 01:28:55,491
the,

3079
01:28:55,491 --> 01:28:58,940
the state and it puts the state lawmakers
in a really weird position because

3080
01:28:58,941 --> 01:29:01,190
they're supposed to listen
to the will of the voters.

3081
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:05,580
And yet state law is trumped by
federal law and everybody knows that.

3082
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:07,980
So how they're supposed
to act as a nether world.

3083
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:11,910
The feds have never given one second of,

3084
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:15,240
of lip service to the idea that
they're going to allow this.

3085
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:15,931
They always say,

3086
01:29:15,931 --> 01:29:16,111
well,

3087
01:29:16,111 --> 01:29:18,690
we're not going to concentrate
on individual users,

3088
01:29:18,691 --> 01:29:19,290
blah blah,

3089
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:20,210
but they do nothing

3090
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:21,670
and the way they say that,

3091
01:29:21,671 --> 01:29:23,320
it's really just to sort of relax.

3092
01:29:23,321 --> 01:29:25,600
People are okay and then they move in.

3093
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:27,090
I don't even think they're
trying to relax people.

3094
01:29:27,091 --> 01:29:29,650
I think you've made it clear that they're
going to go going after individual

3095
01:29:29,651 --> 01:29:33,010
users at least makes people think if
they said we're going after everybody.

3096
01:29:33,011 --> 01:29:36,700
Everybody was smiling upon us when if the
feds ever gone after individual users,

3097
01:29:36,701 --> 01:29:39,670
they don't know that the FBI doesn't come
and arrest the guy smoking weed on the

3098
01:29:39,671 --> 01:29:40,060
corner.

3099
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:40,241
Yeah,

3100
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:42,550
you don't have five
guys break into a house.

3101
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,580
It was a joint selling
joints and that's what's,

3102
01:29:45,581 --> 01:29:46,330
and that

3103
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:47,770
they're just going to be a come up.

3104
01:29:47,771 --> 01:29:50,960
It's a moment and I don't know if that's
going to be because one state goes one

3105
01:29:50,961 --> 01:29:53,750
step farther than everybody else and
that's when you get knocked back.

3106
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:57,420
Or if we get a new president
in there and the first order,

3107
01:29:57,430 --> 01:29:57,770
but you know,

3108
01:29:57,770 --> 01:29:58,100
I don't,

3109
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:01,600
I don't understand the forces at
work that keep this stuff illegal.

3110
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:02,810
If I understood that better,

3111
01:30:02,811 --> 01:30:03,740
then you would know,

3112
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:04,251
okay,

3113
01:30:04,251 --> 01:30:08,540
what's it gonna take to
Piss off that group too far?

3114
01:30:08,541 --> 01:30:08,870
You know,

3115
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:11,120
is it the alcohol lobby
and when do you go so far?

3116
01:30:11,121 --> 01:30:11,810
You know,

3117
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:12,170
I don't,

3118
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:14,030
I don't know who's keeping
this stuff illegal.

3119
01:30:14,031 --> 01:30:15,680
So it's hard for me to pin down what the,

3120
01:30:15,681 --> 01:30:16,011
what the,

3121
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:18,290
what the moment of going
too far it's going to be.

3122
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:20,360
But as we talked about earlier,

3123
01:30:20,810 --> 01:30:23,390
if they don't crack down at some point,

3124
01:30:23,391 --> 01:30:26,870
this stuff is going to
become legal by default.

3125
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:27,261
You know,

3126
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:27,620
it's gonna,

3127
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:32,180
it's gonna grow into legality where we've
got these fig leaf laws on the books

3128
01:30:32,181 --> 01:30:32,990
that prohibited,

3129
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:34,100
but nobody pays any attention.

3130
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:34,301
Well,

3131
01:30:34,301 --> 01:30:34,601
you know,

3132
01:30:34,601 --> 01:30:39,220
logically there's no reason to stop it
from being legal and their idea that it's

3133
01:30:39,221 --> 01:30:44,050
somehow going to harm the interests of
the people that are profiting from it

3134
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:44,771
being illegal.

3135
01:30:44,771 --> 01:30:45,521
I think it's silly.

3136
01:30:45,521 --> 01:30:46,930
It's not going to harm alcohol.

3137
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,220
People are still going to drink.

3138
01:30:48,221 --> 01:30:49,360
People enjoy drinking.

3139
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:50,440
It's fun for people.

3140
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:54,970
It may limit some prescription drugs
because there's going to be natural

3141
01:30:54,971 --> 01:30:55,780
remedies,

3142
01:30:55,780 --> 01:31:00,220
especially like interocular pressure
being cured by cannabis and people with

3143
01:31:00,221 --> 01:31:05,221
wasting disease and aids that have issues
with nausea and it's one of the best

3144
01:31:05,351 --> 01:31:06,340
things for nausea.

3145
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:11,530
What happens when the people who have
a lot of money invested in pseudo legal

3146
01:31:11,871 --> 01:31:14,990
marijuana start donating
to the federal legislators?

3147
01:31:14,991 --> 01:31:15,890
That's a good question.

3148
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:16,561
You'll get the,

3149
01:31:16,561 --> 01:31:20,510
the corruption working at cross
purposes to the way it's working,

3150
01:31:20,511 --> 01:31:21,090
right?

3151
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:21,211
Well,

3152
01:31:21,211 --> 01:31:24,600
the way they've stopped that is you're
not supposed to be profiting from it in

3153
01:31:24,601 --> 01:31:25,390
California,

3154
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:27,210
the only place where you're
supposed to be profiting from it.

3155
01:31:27,211 --> 01:31:27,661
Ironically,

3156
01:31:27,661 --> 01:31:28,494
it's Colorado.

3157
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:32,710
Colorado allows medical mirror the way
the law pass the medical laws in Colorado

3158
01:31:32,711 --> 01:31:34,890
were different than the
medical laws in California.

3159
01:31:34,891 --> 01:31:35,910
They allowed profit,

3160
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:38,720
whereas in California it's
supposed to be like a nonprofit.

3161
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:41,970
I wonder how much of this has to do with
the fact too that it's the equivalent

3162
01:31:41,971 --> 01:31:42,820
of being able to,

3163
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:44,800
to distill your own alcohol,

3164
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,050
your backyard if you want to.

3165
01:31:46,051 --> 01:31:46,740
I mean you take,

3166
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:50,040
you take all of the companies that you
might be able to get on your bandwagon

3167
01:31:50,041 --> 01:31:53,580
here at Philip Morris could make your
marijuana cigarettes as opposed to

3168
01:31:54,190 --> 01:31:57,250
they have now where you'll just grow
it in the back yard and nobody in the

3169
01:31:57,251 --> 01:31:57,820
house.

3170
01:31:57,820 --> 01:32:00,550
I mean the crazy thing
is such a durable plant.

3171
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:04,240
It's not like something like a tomato
where you have to have good soil and you

3172
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:07,210
have to make sure that you tend to do
it and these things grow with you want

3173
01:32:07,211 --> 01:32:08,770
them to dialed in all 50 states.

3174
01:32:08,771 --> 01:32:09,510
I read something,

3175
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:13,330
if you drive out the window and throw
seeds out the window and come back in a

3176
01:32:13,331 --> 01:32:13,601
month,

3177
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:14,590
you're going to see plants.

3178
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:15,340
They just,

3179
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:16,091
they find a way,

3180
01:32:16,091 --> 01:32:16,710
those little fuck.

3181
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:17,610
Well then we get back to the,

3182
01:32:17,611 --> 01:32:20,130
what we talked about earlier
about trigger points.

3183
01:32:20,131 --> 01:32:20,311
You know,

3184
01:32:20,311 --> 01:32:22,050
when do people rebel?

3185
01:32:22,051 --> 01:32:22,884
When have they had enough?

3186
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:24,143
What if

3187
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:24,631
you get high?

3188
01:32:24,631 --> 01:32:27,740
That's what happens when you get some
LSD and then they rebelled when the

3189
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:28,583
government

3190
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:30,850
down and May and you know,

3191
01:32:30,851 --> 01:32:34,000
like if they go into Colorado or if
they go into Washington or one of these

3192
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:34,834
places where the vote,

3193
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:37,360
the will of the people has been amply,

3194
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:37,980
uh,

3195
01:32:37,980 --> 01:32:42,970
a red enacted into law and the
whole thing and they overturn that,

3196
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:43,931
that's going to be,

3197
01:32:43,931 --> 01:32:45,190
those are going to be interesting,

3198
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:45,490
uh,

3199
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:47,980
trigger points or benchmarks in,

3200
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:48,910
um,

3201
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:50,440
wherever it is we're heading.

3202
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:50,850
So,

3203
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:53,670
you know what they'd been doing the
way the DEA has been handling it and

3204
01:32:53,671 --> 01:32:55,320
California is very fascinating.

3205
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:56,490
They go in,

3206
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,030
they break down the door,

3207
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:59,970
do whatever they got
to do guns in the air,

3208
01:32:59,971 --> 01:33:03,030
pulled people in the ground is a video
of them stepping on some kids neck

3209
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:04,350
college kid just working there.

3210
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:08,940
The cop steps on his Nestle scene
walks over him for no reason.

3211
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:11,040
They smashed the security cameras.

3212
01:33:11,130 --> 01:33:11,530
Okay.

3213
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:14,610
They thought that the cameras were on set.

3214
01:33:14,611 --> 01:33:15,480
It was actually sent,

3215
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:18,780
but through the Internet to a
third party location always.

3216
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:19,501
So,

3217
01:33:19,501 --> 01:33:19,681
uh,

3218
01:33:19,681 --> 01:33:21,450
they got video of this where
they tried to destroy it.

3219
01:33:21,451 --> 01:33:22,284
The cops tried to destroy it.

3220
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:24,780
They steal all the drugs,

3221
01:33:24,810 --> 01:33:27,150
they take all the marijuana
and they steal all the money.

3222
01:33:27,330 --> 01:33:28,350
Then they say,

3223
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:32,850
we are holding a your file until
we decide what to do with it.

3224
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:33,983
And they do nothing.

3225
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,810
So they take thousands of dollars,

3226
01:33:36,811 --> 01:33:37,880
whatever the fuck you have on,

3227
01:33:37,881 --> 01:33:38,220
on,

3228
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:38,881
on the premises,

3229
01:33:38,881 --> 01:33:40,950
they take thousands of
dollars in marijuana.

3230
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:42,360
They'd take all of your,

3231
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:43,081
you know,

3232
01:33:43,081 --> 01:33:44,850
all your cash on hand,

3233
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:46,680
everything that they
want to take from you.

3234
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:47,850
And then they say,

3235
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:49,230
we're holding your file,

3236
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:49,531
we'll,

3237
01:33:49,531 --> 01:33:49,830
we'll,

3238
01:33:49,830 --> 01:33:51,360
we'll tell you what we do when we decide.

3239
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:54,600
And they can hold onto it for
years and years and years.

3240
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,250
So essentially they put
you out of business,

3241
01:33:56,670 --> 01:33:58,410
they put you out of business
without arresting you.

3242
01:33:58,530 --> 01:34:01,110
So are they enforcing federal law?

3243
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:02,280
SORTA,

3244
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:02,940
but they don't.

3245
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,290
Are they enforcing state law?

3246
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:04,741
No.

3247
01:34:04,741 --> 01:34:05,910
So it's not a state law,

3248
01:34:05,911 --> 01:34:06,810
it's just the federal law,

3249
01:34:06,811 --> 01:34:08,220
but they don't actually
do anything about it.

3250
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:11,190
They're very few people were
actually getting brought to trial.

3251
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:11,830
You're saying,

3252
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:12,760
if you look at to what,

3253
01:34:12,761 --> 01:34:13,561
what the,

3254
01:34:13,561 --> 01:34:13,811
the,

3255
01:34:13,811 --> 01:34:18,460
the excuse for the militarization of
police forces over the last 30 years has

3256
01:34:18,461 --> 01:34:18,641
been,

3257
01:34:18,641 --> 01:34:21,370
this drug war has been the greatest
thing that ever happened in terms of,

3258
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:22,091
for example,

3259
01:34:22,091 --> 01:34:23,290
search and seizure laws,

3260
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:23,950
um,

3261
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:24,670
departments.

3262
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:26,500
I mean the idea that someone thought up,

3263
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:26,741
hey,

3264
01:34:26,741 --> 01:34:31,240
wouldn't it be a great incentive to
tell officers that they could get,

3265
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:32,320
well,

3266
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:33,880
there's actually some
great books about this.

3267
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:36,490
Dan Baum wrote one called
smoking mirrors wants,

3268
01:34:36,491 --> 01:34:37,480
there are others where,

3269
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:41,170
where there used to be two
kinds of forfeiture laws,

3270
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:45,520
a criminal one and a civil one without
going too deeply into it in order to

3271
01:34:45,521 --> 01:34:46,331
fight the drug war.

3272
01:34:46,331 --> 01:34:50,710
During this crazy time of the 80s they
decided to combine the two taking the

3273
01:34:50,711 --> 01:34:55,520
lower standard required for one kind and
the higher penalties for the other kind

3274
01:34:55,521 --> 01:35:00,070
of putting them together and is where you
got the situations where if the police

3275
01:35:00,071 --> 01:35:02,560
officer's burst down your
door and found drugs,

3276
01:35:02,561 --> 01:35:05,920
they could seize your corvette
automatically without any sort of a,

3277
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:09,970
an acknowledgment that the corvette was
bought with drug money on the grounds

3278
01:35:09,971 --> 01:35:12,010
that you have to sue us to get it back.

3279
01:35:12,010 --> 01:35:16,570
You have to prove that there was no
drug money here and if you don't,

3280
01:35:16,571 --> 01:35:18,520
if we get to keep this car and sell it,

3281
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,080
at least some of that money,

3282
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:20,950
some departments got it,

3283
01:35:20,951 --> 01:35:22,630
all others had to share
it with other agencies.

3284
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:24,940
Some of that money goes right
back to the people who seized it.

3285
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:27,430
Now this was supposed
to be a great incentive,

3286
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:27,821
right?

3287
01:35:27,821 --> 01:35:30,760
Well we're going to crack it on the drug
users and we'll be able to afford the

3288
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:33,220
narcotics teams cause
they will pay for itself.

3289
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:37,300
But as Radley Balko is written in
a book that's due out anytime now,

3290
01:35:37,301 --> 01:35:39,160
I saw an earlier version of it,

3291
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:44,440
this has exploded the number of cases
where please do these things and it comes

3292
01:35:44,441 --> 01:35:49,120
at the expense of robberies and other
crimes that don't actually benefit the

3293
01:35:49,121 --> 01:35:52,120
department as much as these
search and seizure drug crimes do.

3294
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:53,650
And if you got rid of the drug crimes,

3295
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:56,230
what happens to those departments that
are making a bunch of money off of it

3296
01:35:56,231 --> 01:35:56,450
now,

3297
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:59,330
do you know about the scandal
that's been going on in Tennessee?

3298
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:01,460
You mean the I the the interstate?

3299
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:02,110
Yeah.

3300
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:02,301
Yeah.

3301
01:36:02,301 --> 01:36:02,910
I'm all on top.

3302
01:36:02,910 --> 01:36:04,710
The cops for folks who don't know,

3303
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:06,300
there's this thing they're doing,

3304
01:36:06,301 --> 01:36:06,571
they,

3305
01:36:06,571 --> 01:36:07,220
they,

3306
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:11,280
the police have this policy
called policing for profit.

3307
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,140
So they pull you over,

3308
01:36:13,141 --> 01:36:13,561
like Save,

3309
01:36:13,561 --> 01:36:17,400
you're a truck driver and you live in
your truck and all your money in the world

3310
01:36:17,401 --> 01:36:18,120
isn't that truck.

3311
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,430
What if you have $50,000
and it's in your truck?

3312
01:36:21,030 --> 01:36:21,331
You know,

3313
01:36:21,331 --> 01:36:22,440
they pull you over.

3314
01:36:22,570 --> 01:36:22,861
They say,

3315
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:27,390
why the fuck do you have $50,000 they
take your money and that's theirs.

3316
01:36:27,391 --> 01:36:32,391
Now you have to prove that you got that
money through legal means and the way

3317
01:36:32,821 --> 01:36:34,410
Tennessee's doing it is,

3318
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:37,260
apparently they'd been
doing this for a while.

3319
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:38,190
They've been,

3320
01:36:38,190 --> 01:36:42,180
they've been seizing money
and that money goes to their,

3321
01:36:42,181 --> 01:36:42,510
their,

3322
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:43,500
their police force.

3323
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:47,110
Let me defend those people for a second
though because one of the things that

3324
01:36:47,111 --> 01:36:51,100
doubt Balco his book had that I found
fascinating was remember a lot of these

3325
01:36:51,101 --> 01:36:51,970
people are elected,

3326
01:36:51,971 --> 01:36:52,691
a lot of these shares,

3327
01:36:52,691 --> 01:36:53,201
for example,

3328
01:36:53,201 --> 01:36:55,090
are elected and there was one county,

3329
01:36:55,091 --> 01:36:56,080
I don't remember where it was,

3330
01:36:56,081 --> 01:36:57,940
where the sheriff was
not going to do this,

3331
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,820
and the guy who ran against
him for sheriff said,

3332
01:37:00,821 --> 01:37:03,280
do you know how much money
we're missing out on?

3333
01:37:03,281 --> 01:37:07,270
We're cutting officers left and right
enforcement because we won't just go and

3334
01:37:07,271 --> 01:37:09,070
do what other look up at
the county next door has.

3335
01:37:09,071 --> 01:37:11,980
They've got all this equipment and all
these officers because they're seizing

3336
01:37:11,981 --> 01:37:13,270
assets and we're not.

3337
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:17,650
In other words because the feds do not
come in and enforce the constitution

3338
01:37:17,651 --> 01:37:19,360
because they allow this because it's,

3339
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:23,020
remember before the war on terror made
everything okay if it was part of the war

3340
01:37:23,021 --> 01:37:23,620
on terror,

3341
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:27,790
the war on drugs allowed us to rip open
parts of the Constitution on the grounds

3342
01:37:28,030 --> 01:37:31,060
that this war was so important and
that were so many lives at stake.

3343
01:37:31,061 --> 01:37:32,140
And like the mafia,

3344
01:37:32,141 --> 01:37:34,120
it was so resistant to normal,

3345
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:34,451
you know,

3346
01:37:34,451 --> 01:37:38,680
law enforcement techniques that we
needed special tools that the federal

3347
01:37:38,681 --> 01:37:42,070
government not only allowed this
stuff but encouraged people to do it.

3348
01:37:42,071 --> 01:37:45,940
And I would like to say
proudly Los Angeles with
Police Chief Daryl Gates in the

3349
01:37:45,941 --> 01:37:48,370
old days was one of the
leaders in this when he would,

3350
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:49,960
when we had the first tank,

3351
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,030
I remember we had the
first tank to knock down,

3352
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:52,421
you know,

3353
01:37:52,421 --> 01:37:52,651
the,

3354
01:37:52,651 --> 01:37:54,850
the drug buildings and
everything else and seize the,

3355
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:56,070
um,

3356
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,260
once that becomes standard fair,

3357
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:00,630
are you going to be the sheriff that says,

3358
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:01,800
I don't do that.

3359
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:03,480
When the guy running against you says,

3360
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:04,560
look at our idiot sheriff,

3361
01:38:04,561 --> 01:38:06,480
he's missing out on all
these federal dollars.

3362
01:38:06,481 --> 01:38:07,314
Plus the Fed,

3363
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:10,840
the Fed's actually match
some of your costs.

3364
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:15,600
They will hand you down paramilitary
stuff as part of like used war surplus and

3365
01:38:15,601 --> 01:38:16,434
everything else.

3366
01:38:16,530 --> 01:38:20,580
I mean when you see these police
officers in full cammo gear carrying ar

3367
01:38:20,581 --> 01:38:21,600
fifteens and everything,

3368
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:24,270
a lot of that stuff is hand me
down right from the military.

3369
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:27,090
And if you don't want that,

3370
01:38:27,091 --> 01:38:30,930
you're going to run around with a stupid
cult 44 revolver when you could have an

3371
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:32,400
ar 15 and a tank.

3372
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,410
What kind of bad sheriff are you?

3373
01:38:34,411 --> 01:38:35,244
Joe Rogan.

3374
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:36,083
I'm a,

3375
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:36,420
uh,

3376
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:36,940
you know,

3377
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:37,571
believe it or not,

3378
01:38:37,571 --> 01:38:38,500
but what I'm saying,

3379
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:38,800
uh,

3380
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:39,910
or some of the things that I've said,

3381
01:38:39,911 --> 01:38:41,740
I'm a big supporter of
law enforcement too.

3382
01:38:41,770 --> 01:38:42,940
I think it's very important.

3383
01:38:42,970 --> 01:38:43,990
I think it's a,

3384
01:38:43,991 --> 01:38:46,270
they're underappreciated
and it's not their gig.

3385
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:48,430
The actual officers on the
street don't make these rules.

3386
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:49,450
Exactly.

3387
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:50,081
Exactly.

3388
01:38:50,081 --> 01:38:51,940
And I think most of them are good guys.

3389
01:38:51,941 --> 01:38:53,290
They have the hardest job in the world.

3390
01:38:53,291 --> 01:38:54,360
It's really difficult.

3391
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:54,550
He,

3392
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:58,060
you're protecting people
from bad people and it's a,

3393
01:38:58,061 --> 01:38:59,290
if you're going to have bad people,

3394
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:00,250
you're going to need cops.

3395
01:39:00,610 --> 01:39:00,911
The,

3396
01:39:00,911 --> 01:39:01,810
the issue is one,

3397
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:03,460
one bad one exists.

3398
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:04,570
It makes it,

3399
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:05,290
it's like,

3400
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:05,710
you know,

3401
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:07,600
it was 110 people in New Jersey.

3402
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:08,260
Douchebag,

3403
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:09,011
probably not even,

3404
01:39:09,011 --> 01:39:10,210
it's probably like one out of 20.

3405
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:11,390
But when you think about jersey,

3406
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:12,420
think about Douche bags.

3407
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,230
It's just,

3408
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:14,660
and what the laws,

3409
01:39:14,661 --> 01:39:16,460
I mean the cops just enforce the laws.

3410
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:17,211
They don't write them,

3411
01:39:17,211 --> 01:39:18,020
they don't make them,

3412
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:19,780
they don't decide what's constitutional,

3413
01:39:19,781 --> 01:39:20,201
what's not.

3414
01:39:20,201 --> 01:39:20,841
And it's also,

3415
01:39:20,841 --> 01:39:23,820
they're dealing with fucking
bad people all day long.

3416
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:24,753
Every day.

3417
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:27,500
They're dealing with people
that are too many crimes,

3418
01:39:27,501 --> 01:39:28,490
trying to get away with things,

3419
01:39:28,491 --> 01:39:29,091
lying to them,

3420
01:39:29,091 --> 01:39:30,500
constantly shooting at them.

3421
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:32,090
When I was a reporter,

3422
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:32,751
we had a lot of,

3423
01:39:32,751 --> 01:39:32,990
um,

3424
01:39:32,990 --> 01:39:33,230
you know,

3425
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:35,150
you develop relationships
with these people.

3426
01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:35,900
Um,

3427
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,610
and you do it at the weirdest times.

3428
01:39:37,611 --> 01:39:39,170
I would go out to these murder scenes.

3429
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:41,600
It'd be like four in
the morning in the rain.

3430
01:39:41,870 --> 01:39:43,070
You're seeing the same guy,

3431
01:39:43,071 --> 01:39:43,251
you know,

3432
01:39:43,251 --> 01:39:46,250
the same watch guy you see
all the time in the field and,

3433
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:47,480
or you call them.

3434
01:39:47,481 --> 01:39:48,470
When I was at ABC here,

3435
01:39:48,471 --> 01:39:48,681
I mean,

3436
01:39:48,681 --> 01:39:49,310
I used to do the,

3437
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:50,121
the beat checks.

3438
01:39:50,121 --> 01:39:50,990
They're called a news,

3439
01:39:50,991 --> 01:39:53,900
which is where you call all these police
divisions and you're talking to the

3440
01:39:53,901 --> 01:39:54,770
same poor guy.

3441
01:39:54,770 --> 01:39:57,370
It's midnight and I'm calling
the same guy how you do.

3442
01:39:57,380 --> 01:39:57,830
And I,

3443
01:39:57,830 --> 01:39:58,221
you know,

3444
01:39:58,221 --> 01:40:01,070
I mean they're just working
schleps like the rest of us.

3445
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:01,881
And you know what,

3446
01:40:01,881 --> 01:40:06,190
how many of us would perform any better
after five years on the job with guys

3447
01:40:06,191 --> 01:40:06,751
shooting you?

3448
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:07,910
That insane pressure.

3449
01:40:07,911 --> 01:40:08,744
It's insane pressure.

3450
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:09,893
But again,

3451
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:13,280
to get back to the people who are really
responsible for this other people,

3452
01:40:13,281 --> 01:40:15,550
we elect that and boat wall.

3453
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:16,101
It's also,

3454
01:40:16,101 --> 01:40:21,101
I think that as a society we have to put
much more emphasis in our schools and

3455
01:40:22,371 --> 01:40:24,230
much more in our police force.

3456
01:40:24,231 --> 01:40:25,100
I think police,

3457
01:40:25,101 --> 01:40:25,934
fire,

3458
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:28,400
EMT and schools,

3459
01:40:28,401 --> 01:40:29,360
it's the,

3460
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:31,340
there should be so much more money

3461
01:40:31,410 --> 01:40:34,080
dedicated to these areas so much more.

3462
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:35,380
And it's,

3463
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:36,040
it's really,

3464
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:36,330
uh,

3465
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:40,920
a crime of society that we've allowed
our politicians and the people in office

3466
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:45,030
to allocate so much resources to other
parts of the country while ignoring the,

3467
01:40:45,031 --> 01:40:45,240
oh,

3468
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,070
there are problems that
we have here at home.

3469
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:51,360
I don't think there's anything wrong with
help big out less fortunate countries,

3470
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:56,630
but the way we do it under the guise
of military invasion and the amount of

3471
01:40:57,531 --> 01:41:00,350
money that goes to that and where that
money goes and you look at how much

3472
01:41:00,351 --> 01:41:03,550
Halliburton has made off this fucking
war and weapons manufacturers for me

3473
01:41:03,551 --> 01:41:06,780
enough this war that is really a,

3474
01:41:06,781 --> 01:41:09,320
a criminal misallocation of funds.

3475
01:41:09,630 --> 01:41:10,560
I was recently,

3476
01:41:10,561 --> 01:41:12,270
and this is a weird
story in and of itself,

3477
01:41:12,271 --> 01:41:14,220
my listeners know about it
cause I did a show on it.

3478
01:41:14,490 --> 01:41:19,490
I was invited to a Centcom US Central
Command planning session not that long

3479
01:41:20,641 --> 01:41:20,850
ago.

3480
01:41:20,850 --> 01:41:22,050
They flew me to DC.

3481
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:22,681
Yeah.

3482
01:41:22,681 --> 01:41:23,550
Put me up in a hotel.

3483
01:41:23,551 --> 01:41:26,800
I thought I was assured that they were
going to kill me and throw my body into

3484
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:29,350
Potomac and this was all an
excuse to get me over there too.

3485
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:31,960
You refrained from jerking off in the
hotel room because he felt like was a

3486
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:32,241
camera.

3487
01:41:32,241 --> 01:41:32,510
Yeah.

3488
01:41:32,510 --> 01:41:33,020
Uh,

3489
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:35,240
I assume there was a camera in there.

3490
01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:35,870
Um,

3491
01:41:35,870 --> 01:41:36,500
do you want to Cameron,

3492
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:36,770
Eric,

3493
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:41,060
but went in there probably more of a
time problem I was dealing with there.

3494
01:41:41,061 --> 01:41:42,970
I was very rushed but I,

3495
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:46,280
but you arrive there and it was all
these people with these amazing,

3496
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:48,860
I said they must have been thrilled to
have me on the guest list because there

3497
01:41:48,861 --> 01:41:52,130
were only 12 participants and they
all had these massively doctor,

3498
01:41:52,131 --> 01:41:53,660
this and that from this institution.

3499
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:55,910
And then Dan Carlin
podcaster and it was just,

3500
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,020
they had to be thrilled.

3501
01:41:57,021 --> 01:41:57,854
I was there.

3502
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,010
But the first question
I asked these folks,

3503
01:42:01,011 --> 01:42:01,501
I mean it was the,

3504
01:42:01,501 --> 01:42:01,671
the,

3505
01:42:01,671 --> 01:42:04,250
the general that was there was
the head of US Central Command.

3506
01:42:04,251 --> 01:42:06,530
The vice admiral was there and I said,

3507
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:09,830
what are us taxpayers
get from all of this?

3508
01:42:09,831 --> 01:42:10,281
In other words,

3509
01:42:10,281 --> 01:42:14,270
if we're going to go cost to benefit
and you talk about vital us national

3510
01:42:14,271 --> 01:42:15,010
security and this,

3511
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:15,890
that or this other area,

3512
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:21,020
what is the average us taxpayer who's
paying for this get for all of this?

3513
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:23,990
Now there was no good answer and
it's not these guys job to answer it.

3514
01:42:23,991 --> 01:42:24,824
They don't make policy.

3515
01:42:24,890 --> 01:42:26,090
They're like cops too.

3516
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:27,320
They don't make policy,

3517
01:42:27,590 --> 01:42:29,360
but you want to ask your representatives,

3518
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:30,200
you know,

3519
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:30,441
I mean,

3520
01:42:30,441 --> 01:42:33,200
I know you say we need to be here
and there to protect our security,

3521
01:42:33,201 --> 01:42:35,300
but really what does the United States,

3522
01:42:35,301 --> 01:42:37,040
from what I get from our
involvement in the Middle East,

3523
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:38,270
the oil situations,

3524
01:42:38,271 --> 01:42:40,460
not like it was in the early
seventies we're not going to be,

3525
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:43,730
there's not going to be petro blackmail
like there wasn't the old days.

3526
01:42:43,731 --> 01:42:45,320
It's one big giant oil market.

3527
01:42:45,321 --> 01:42:49,100
Now why do we get to be the
people to pay for this if it's,

3528
01:42:49,101 --> 01:42:51,140
if it's for the entire world's sake,

3529
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:53,410
why isn't the entire world paying for,

3530
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:56,360
why aren't their soldiers dying
in the field as much as ours are?

3531
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:59,540
I mean these are the kinds of questions
we talked earlier about why can't we

3532
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:00,920
have a national debate about this?

3533
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:04,670
I don't care if the answer comes from
the wrong side of what I consider to be

3534
01:43:04,671 --> 01:43:05,504
right or wrong,

3535
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:06,860
but let's just talk about it.

3536
01:43:06,861 --> 01:43:09,410
And I have this conspiracy theory that
the reason we don't have these national

3537
01:43:09,411 --> 01:43:12,080
debates is cause some of this
stuff is just indefensible.

3538
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:15,680
It's the same thing with President
Obama trying to say it's okay to kill

3539
01:43:15,681 --> 01:43:16,580
Americans with drones.

3540
01:43:16,581 --> 01:43:19,550
You don't hear him talk about it cause
I don't think you can get up and make

3541
01:43:19,551 --> 01:43:20,384
that case.

3542
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:22,030
And so just don't talk about it.

3543
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:23,150
If you can't win an argument,

3544
01:43:23,151 --> 01:43:24,080
don't have the argument.

3545
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:24,691
Yeah.

3546
01:43:24,691 --> 01:43:27,810
That's the reason why I've never heard
a politician bring up cigarettes.

3547
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:32,070
You'll hear politicians talk about
alcohol or drugs and even prescription

3548
01:43:32,071 --> 01:43:33,270
medications being issues.

3549
01:43:33,271 --> 01:43:35,160
You never hear him talking
about cigarettes ever.

3550
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:36,030
Why?

3551
01:43:36,030 --> 01:43:39,330
Cause they spend billions of dollars
to keep politicians from talking about

3552
01:43:39,331 --> 01:43:40,164
cigarettes.

3553
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:41,100
You know,

3554
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:44,820
hundreds of thousands of people
die every year from cigarettes.

3555
01:43:44,821 --> 01:43:46,200
He would think that's a real health issue.

3556
01:43:46,230 --> 01:43:46,531
No,

3557
01:43:46,531 --> 01:43:47,101
it's obesity.

3558
01:43:47,101 --> 01:43:47,934
We've got problems.

3559
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:48,300
You know,

3560
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,290
we've got problems with cancer,

3561
01:43:49,291 --> 01:43:50,400
we've got problems with AIDS.

3562
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:51,110
We've got,

3563
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:51,980
we have problems with the

3564
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,740
fucking some poison that
they sell at every corner.

3565
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:56,630
But the people that sell that poison,

3566
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:58,160
kick it back upstairs.

3567
01:43:58,190 --> 01:43:59,300
But this is nothing new.

3568
01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:00,980
This is part of how,

3569
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:01,970
I mean,

3570
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:02,360
listen,

3571
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:03,440
as I said to somebody else,

3572
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:04,041
and by the way,

3573
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:05,780
I should say I'm before cigarettes.

3574
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,740
If you want to smoke cigarettes,

3575
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:07,250
I don't know.

3576
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:08,480
I think cigarettes should be illegal.

3577
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:09,430
Stop talking about cigarettes.

3578
01:44:11,860 --> 01:44:12,500
But,

3579
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:12,900
but listen,

3580
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:15,350
I know I'm not trying to stop
people except my friends.

3581
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:17,330
Every country in the world is corrupt.

3582
01:44:17,331 --> 01:44:17,511
Don't,

3583
01:44:17,511 --> 01:44:18,650
don't think that there's any government,

3584
01:44:18,651 --> 01:44:18,751
me,

3585
01:44:18,751 --> 01:44:19,251
Sweden,

3586
01:44:19,251 --> 01:44:19,491
which,

3587
01:44:19,491 --> 01:44:22,520
which always ranks in the top three or
four is the least corrupt nations of the

3588
01:44:22,521 --> 01:44:24,580
world still has corruption there.

3589
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:24,980
Why,

3590
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:26,270
why Swiss chicks are hot?

3591
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:26,850
It's,

3592
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:28,940
we're talking about Sweden
and the two confused,

3593
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:32,510
but we dish every country
has been corruption.

3594
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:36,180
There's a tipping point as Sweden's number
one on your list of I confused those

3595
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:36,490
two.

3596
01:44:36,490 --> 01:44:36,681
Well,

3597
01:44:36,681 --> 01:44:37,161
if you go there,

3598
01:44:37,161 --> 01:44:38,180
they won't be any confusion.

3599
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:38,780
Um,

3600
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:41,010
if you have the number
one least corrupt country,

3601
01:44:41,011 --> 01:44:41,760
Sweden and that,

3602
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,360
and the per the country at the
bottom of the list is Nigeria,

3603
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:49,430
I guarantee you that government can
function well a certain distance down that

3604
01:44:49,431 --> 01:44:49,760
list.

3605
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:50,810
There's a tipping point,

3606
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:51,831
I think if you say,

3607
01:44:51,831 --> 01:44:52,071
well,

3608
01:44:52,071 --> 01:44:53,810
do you know the United States
has always been corrupt?

3609
01:44:53,811 --> 01:44:55,310
Look at how things were in the 1950s.

3610
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:56,121
Yes,

3611
01:44:56,121 --> 01:44:58,220
but we were still able to function.

3612
01:44:58,430 --> 01:44:58,611
You know,

3613
01:44:58,611 --> 01:44:59,960
the corruption was not so much of,

3614
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:02,150
it's like if you have a
physical impediment and you say,

3615
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:02,481
well,

3616
01:45:02,481 --> 01:45:03,171
I limp around,

3617
01:45:03,171 --> 01:45:04,160
but I still get around.

3618
01:45:04,161 --> 01:45:04,790
Okay,

3619
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:07,340
and your knee gets much worse and
all of a sudden you can't walk.

3620
01:45:07,341 --> 01:45:07,630
There's,

3621
01:45:07,630 --> 01:45:10,790
there's a tipping point not walking as
a whole different thing than limping

3622
01:45:10,791 --> 01:45:11,211
around.

3623
01:45:11,211 --> 01:45:12,020
Right.

3624
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:15,890
Our government was always corrupt from
the very beginning of the republic.

3625
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:18,650
We've just reached a point where it
doesn't function any well then it's so

3626
01:45:18,651 --> 01:45:18,980
corrupt.

3627
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:23,180
It's also that it is not just that it's
so much more corrupt than ever before.

3628
01:45:23,181 --> 01:45:26,600
It's so much more transparent that
it's corrupt because of our access to

3629
01:45:26,601 --> 01:45:27,201
information,

3630
01:45:27,201 --> 01:45:32,150
which is unprecedented and people are
bewildered by it more than they ever have

3631
01:45:32,151 --> 01:45:33,320
been before because of this,

3632
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:35,510
because if you go look
and it's really simple,

3633
01:45:35,511 --> 01:45:36,680
just go looking real quick.

3634
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:37,760
Read any Matt tie.

3635
01:45:37,761 --> 01:45:41,330
He be article from rolling stone on
on the financial crisis and you'll,

3636
01:45:41,331 --> 01:45:41,780
you'll,

3637
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:42,021
you'll,

3638
01:45:42,021 --> 01:45:42,291
you'll,

3639
01:45:42,291 --> 01:45:44,900
you'll fucking pluck your eyebrows
out screaming in the mirror.

3640
01:45:44,901 --> 01:45:45,081
You,

3641
01:45:45,081 --> 01:45:46,160
you won't be able to feel,

3642
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,900
you won't be able to feel
like it makes any sense.

3643
01:45:47,930 --> 01:45:49,850
Let me tell you that this is
the great wildcard though.

3644
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:52,670
We alluded to this earlier when we talked
about what at the sixties generation

3645
01:45:52,671 --> 01:45:53,504
had had the internet.

3646
01:45:53,690 --> 01:45:54,523
Um,

3647
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:54,831
you know,

3648
01:45:54,831 --> 01:45:59,831
when you read about how much just printing
presses change the world in terms of

3649
01:46:00,651 --> 01:46:05,390
just being able to disseminate English
language bibles changed everything.

3650
01:46:05,930 --> 01:46:06,770
This w you know,

3651
01:46:06,771 --> 01:46:07,401
people forget,

3652
01:46:07,401 --> 01:46:07,611
you know,

3653
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:08,990
he's like you said 20 years ago,

3654
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:10,940
it's like a blink of an eye
when you've lived a while.

3655
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:13,060
This internet is still brand new.

3656
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:17,060
We haven't begun to see what it's going
to do yet and we haven't had these

3657
01:46:17,061 --> 01:46:17,930
situations.

3658
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:18,891
Like you were saying,

3659
01:46:18,891 --> 01:46:21,950
these little tipping point moments where
all of a sudden the Internet makes all

3660
01:46:21,951 --> 01:46:23,000
the difference in the world.

3661
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:27,980
If the stupid printing press changes
the world to the degree that did,

3662
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:32,180
what's this going to do and how are
the authorities going to react when it

3663
01:46:32,181 --> 01:46:33,080
starts to doing it?

3664
01:46:33,290 --> 01:46:33,591
I mean,

3665
01:46:33,591 --> 01:46:33,801
you know,

3666
01:46:33,801 --> 01:46:36,350
we were talking about anonymous
before the whole show started.

3667
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:38,480
That's just the tip of the iceberg.

3668
01:46:38,481 --> 01:46:42,950
What happens when this isn't some little
teeny group on the fringes that's doing

3669
01:46:42,951 --> 01:46:43,280
this?

3670
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:47,600
What happens when 40% of the population
is so mad and maybe 20% of them are the

3671
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:50,160
right wing guys who think that they
need the guns to stop the government.

3672
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:53,250
20% of them are the left wing guys
that are so mad that they can't get,

3673
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:53,520
you know,

3674
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,353
something else that they,

3675
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:58,260
I mean what happens when all these people
are operating at cross purposes and

3676
01:46:58,261 --> 01:47:01,800
the Internet is this highway that lets
them all talk in a way that during the

3677
01:47:01,801 --> 01:47:05,880
1960 [inaudible] they would have been
doing mimeographed letters on a copy

3678
01:47:05,881 --> 01:47:09,790
machine handing each other than by hand
meeting in the park and this foam soap

3679
01:47:09,791 --> 01:47:11,100
box and on the phone.

3680
01:47:11,101 --> 01:47:11,790
I mean this is,

3681
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:12,300
this is,

3682
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:14,700
we have not yet begun to see
what this is going to do.

3683
01:47:14,701 --> 01:47:15,360
Change.

3684
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:15,841
I agree.

3685
01:47:15,841 --> 01:47:20,841
And I also think that this is just the
beginning of what seems to be an ever

3686
01:47:21,721 --> 01:47:24,360
increasing access to each other,

3687
01:47:24,361 --> 01:47:25,560
access to information,

3688
01:47:25,561 --> 01:47:27,300
the ability to reach and
connect with each other.

3689
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:30,750
And I think that's going to eventually
lead to something that's going to allow

3690
01:47:30,751 --> 01:47:32,970
people to read each other's minds.

3691
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:34,170
I think we're going to,

3692
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:34,560
we're a,

3693
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:39,560
our eventual connection is going to be
through some sort of wireless and neuro

3694
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:44,940
frequency connection where we're going
to be able to exchange information

3695
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:46,890
without having to talk to each other.

3696
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:47,451
I'm sorry.

3697
01:47:47,451 --> 01:47:47,641
You see,

3698
01:47:47,641 --> 01:47:49,870
you see the upside and
that I see the downside.

3699
01:47:50,350 --> 01:47:52,860
What happens with the government
reads your mind and it's,

3700
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:53,170
well,

3701
01:47:53,170 --> 01:47:54,010
we just bypass.

3702
01:47:54,011 --> 01:47:54,611
This was just something,

3703
01:47:54,611 --> 01:47:56,440
it's too dangerous for
an individual to have,

3704
01:47:56,441 --> 01:47:58,900
but we'll be able to watch
you on your computers.

3705
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:01,620
Government will become
victims of themselves,

3706
01:48:01,621 --> 01:48:02,441
much like portray.

3707
01:48:02,441 --> 01:48:07,290
This has become a victim of this whole
spy network and the ability to access

3708
01:48:07,291 --> 01:48:08,240
information that's been on

3709
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:08,690
precedent.

3710
01:48:08,690 --> 01:48:09,770
I'm sorry it was betray us.

3711
01:48:09,771 --> 01:48:10,311
An idiot.

3712
01:48:10,311 --> 01:48:10,791
Can I just,

3713
01:48:10,791 --> 01:48:11,540
can I just say this?

3714
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:13,310
You're the head of the CIA

3715
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:17,650
and you think that they're not
going to find out that you have it.

3716
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:17,961
I mean,

3717
01:48:17,961 --> 01:48:18,680
this whole thing,

3718
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:19,010
there's,

3719
01:48:19,010 --> 01:48:20,180
you talk about something weird.

3720
01:48:20,181 --> 01:48:20,690
There's something,

3721
01:48:20,690 --> 01:48:23,010
there's some little x there
that we don't know about.

3722
01:48:23,011 --> 01:48:23,844
It's Ben Gazi.

3723
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:24,480
Yeah.

3724
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:25,313
Ben Gazi.

3725
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:25,581
No,

3726
01:48:25,581 --> 01:48:26,010
for real.

3727
01:48:26,010 --> 01:48:28,040
I haven't figured out the
Ben Gazi thing either.

3728
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:28,791
I haven't either.

3729
01:48:28,791 --> 01:48:31,120
But there is connection and that's,

3730
01:48:31,121 --> 01:48:33,290
that's pretty much been
established that they are there.

3731
01:48:33,310 --> 01:48:37,010
They're shielding by one of the
things they're doing with punishing,

3732
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:41,360
betray us in this way and going after
him is acknowledging his failures in

3733
01:48:41,361 --> 01:48:42,650
Benghazi and the,

3734
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:47,090
there's a sort of an internal motivation
to get rid of him outside of just the

3735
01:48:47,091 --> 01:48:49,370
fact that the FBI busted
him with an affair.

3736
01:48:49,580 --> 01:48:53,750
What I found most fascinating about this
was first of all that the head spook

3737
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:54,860
got spooked on.

3738
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:56,110
I mean they,

3739
01:48:56,110 --> 01:48:56,620
they,

3740
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:57,090
and,

3741
01:48:57,090 --> 01:49:01,100
and then that even when you're a general,

3742
01:49:01,130 --> 01:49:04,310
you're dealing with the kind of girl was
going to fuck you when you're married

3743
01:49:04,311 --> 01:49:05,630
is crazy bitch.

3744
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:06,560
Okay.

3745
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,780
And the kind of chick
that's going to be your,

3746
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:13,160
your mistress when she writes a book
about you that that's going to be a

3747
01:49:13,161 --> 01:49:13,811
territorial,

3748
01:49:13,811 --> 01:49:13,950
yeah,

3749
01:49:13,950 --> 01:49:15,140
that's a Greek tragedy.

3750
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:18,320
And that goes back to him either
a Greek plays that play off.

3751
01:49:18,321 --> 01:49:19,250
That's why I love it.

3752
01:49:19,251 --> 01:49:20,870
There's something that's so wonderfully,

3753
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:21,310
you know,

3754
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:25,940
we all have these tragic flaws and it's
like that guy was born with that and

3755
01:49:25,941 --> 01:49:27,410
then he was like faded.

3756
01:49:27,411 --> 01:49:28,041
The Greeks would say,

3757
01:49:28,041 --> 01:49:31,040
it was like written into his faith
that I'm going to have this wonderful

3758
01:49:31,041 --> 01:49:31,680
military career,

3759
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:36,680
be respected by everybody and then I'm
going to be brought low by so silly.

3760
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:39,080
Bring yourself to the world of Oj Simpson.

3761
01:49:39,630 --> 01:49:42,530
I was just talking about that
with my wife the other day.

3762
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:43,513
We're watching them,

3763
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,840
one of those top 10 footballs,

3764
01:49:44,841 --> 01:49:45,021
you know,

3765
01:49:45,021 --> 01:49:48,340
greatest running backs of all time road
and they're screwing poor Oj Simpson.

3766
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:48,791
Nothing he's but,

3767
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:49,810
but as a football player,

3768
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:52,720
if you remember how great
he was and you know,

3769
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:55,120
they're putting like Tim Teebo
or something ahead of him.

3770
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:55,451
I'm going,

3771
01:49:55,451 --> 01:49:55,631
you know,

3772
01:49:55,631 --> 01:49:58,180
he's just getting rooked because
of what he did off the phone.

3773
01:49:58,181 --> 01:49:59,014
It's like,

3774
01:49:59,370 --> 01:49:59,580
yeah,

3775
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:00,790
you can get me get mad at,

3776
01:50:00,791 --> 01:50:01,540
you can get mad at,

3777
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:01,820
uh,

3778
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:02,560
at,

3779
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,360
at Pete rose for being,

3780
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:04,881
you know,

3781
01:50:04,881 --> 01:50:05,010
a,

3782
01:50:05,010 --> 01:50:06,370
a jerk off field,

3783
01:50:06,371 --> 01:50:06,731
but don't,

3784
01:50:06,731 --> 01:50:07,061
don't,

3785
01:50:07,061 --> 01:50:08,920
don't take away what he did on the field.

3786
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:11,170
Oj Simpson was the most
beautiful runner I ever saw.

3787
01:50:11,171 --> 01:50:12,550
Barry Sanders was the most exciting,

3788
01:50:12,551 --> 01:50:15,030
but Oj Simpson was the most
beautiful runner I ever saw.

3789
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:16,203
And he's a,

3790
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:16,961
I mean he's one of the,

3791
01:50:16,961 --> 01:50:18,100
I mean he's a terrible person.

3792
01:50:18,101 --> 01:50:18,940
We all know this now,

3793
01:50:18,941 --> 01:50:19,870
but God,

3794
01:50:19,871 --> 01:50:20,380
don't,

3795
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:25,380
you know Oj Simpson was was the best and
what a world changing moment for him.

3796
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:26,130
Yes.

3797
01:50:26,130 --> 01:50:26,700
To Go.

3798
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:28,210
What a bad decision.

3799
01:50:28,211 --> 01:50:29,044
You know,

3800
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:31,660
I could go back and take it back.

3801
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:32,830
I know you think about that all the time.

3802
01:50:32,831 --> 01:50:36,820
The one moment that if I could just have
that day or it's a groundhog day thing,

3803
01:50:36,821 --> 01:50:38,740
if I could just do that
whole day differently.

3804
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:39,940
The betrays thing.

3805
01:50:39,970 --> 01:50:40,840
Even though it's bad,

3806
01:50:40,841 --> 01:50:44,200
he still gets to bang that chick and
she's way over AA still gets the pension.

3807
01:50:44,201 --> 01:50:45,034
That's all you care.

3808
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:46,620
Cause he's still get his bomb shit.

3809
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:48,070
Well maybe not the CIA one,

3810
01:50:48,071 --> 01:50:48,940
but he gets the military,

3811
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:51,570
they have to give him a pension
or he's going to start talking.

3812
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:52,160
What do you want?

3813
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,850
You want general Patraeus start
writing books about shit really works.

3814
01:50:54,851 --> 01:50:56,860
I think that's when you have
your Kennedy moment again.

3815
01:50:56,861 --> 01:50:59,650
General Patraeus knocked
off in a visit to Guatemala.

3816
01:50:59,700 --> 01:50:59,980
Yeah.

3817
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:02,350
He's banging his mistress
and her pussy explodes.

3818
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,510
He's going to put Nitroglycerin in there.

3819
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:05,260
The,

3820
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:07,030
the how you're off in the woods for me,

3821
01:51:07,031 --> 01:51:09,520
rogue going into territory.

3822
01:51:09,521 --> 01:51:13,750
I don't go to kill her too
because this is Cheryl.

3823
01:51:13,810 --> 01:51:16,000
We knew this was going to
happen in this show today.

3824
01:51:16,001 --> 01:51:16,834
Didn't we?

3825
01:51:17,050 --> 01:51:18,280
Pillow talk terrorism.

3826
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:19,151
That's what that is.

3827
01:51:19,151 --> 01:51:20,110
It's in the Patriot Act.

3828
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:20,900
She,

3829
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:21,450
uh,

3830
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:23,170
she can't see who's doing pillow talk,

3831
01:51:23,171 --> 01:51:23,681
terrorism.

3832
01:51:23,681 --> 01:51:25,510
We had to take her out and uh,

3833
01:51:25,550 --> 01:51:25,750
we,

3834
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:29,260
it's unfortunate Patraeus was there but
we clowned him so don't worry about it.

3835
01:51:30,610 --> 01:51:31,510
The poor guy.

3836
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:32,680
And the whole thing is,

3837
01:51:32,770 --> 01:51:35,490
what's really tragic is you
see the wife and you know,

3838
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:36,940
his wife is sort of,

3839
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:39,850
you let herself go over the years and
I believe she had some health problems.

3840
01:51:39,851 --> 01:51:40,840
She's a little rather large.

3841
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:44,040
Remember in the military I think you can
still be charged with adultery to which

3842
01:51:44,041 --> 01:51:45,120
you can't be nobody.

3843
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:48,700
There is no law against adultery in the
California penal code for an average

3844
01:51:48,701 --> 01:51:49,060
Joe.

3845
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:51,670
What's ironic about that is
she taking trained killers,

3846
01:51:51,671 --> 01:51:54,640
putting them in an unbelievably stressful
situations for months at a time away

3847
01:51:54,641 --> 01:51:55,474
from their wives.

3848
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:57,670
And you're saying that
if you're an adulterer,

3849
01:51:57,671 --> 01:52:01,750
we can court marshal yet goes back
to the military code of honor,

3850
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:04,120
which of course there's a lot of other
things you could do that would seem to

3851
01:52:04,121 --> 01:52:05,590
violate the military code of honor,

3852
01:52:05,591 --> 01:52:06,251
but don't have,

3853
01:52:06,251 --> 01:52:06,790
you know,

3854
01:52:06,790 --> 01:52:07,990
don't have adulterous affairs.

3855
01:52:07,991 --> 01:52:10,660
I just thought it was beautiful that
the head spooked got spooked on.

3856
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:11,180
I'm sorry.

3857
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:11,350
No,

3858
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:11,651
it's not.

3859
01:52:11,651 --> 01:52:16,651
It's not that to me that's a symptom of
something else because he's not a dumb

3860
01:52:17,081 --> 01:52:17,830
guy.

3861
01:52:17,830 --> 01:52:20,500
And yet what you're going to do
when they arrive and they said,

3862
01:52:20,501 --> 01:52:20,861
guess what?

3863
01:52:20,861 --> 01:52:21,490
We found out?

3864
01:52:21,490 --> 01:52:22,570
Do you think he was shot?

3865
01:52:22,630 --> 01:52:23,261
Oh my God.

3866
01:52:23,261 --> 01:52:24,670
How did you find out about that?

3867
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:25,270
No,

3868
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:27,310
I'll tell you what it is when,

3869
01:52:27,311 --> 01:52:27,970
first of all,

3870
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:32,380
they were together for over a
year while they wrote that book.

3871
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:33,250
Okay.

3872
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:34,720
And when you know,

3873
01:52:34,730 --> 01:52:37,710
you can start off with a
girl who's attempt trust,

3874
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:39,190
like how you've analyzed this,

3875
01:52:39,191 --> 01:52:42,010
I've analyzed this very carefully
because that woman is marked much,

3876
01:52:42,011 --> 01:52:44,770
much more attractive as a
woman than he is as a man.

3877
01:52:45,110 --> 01:52:45,331
Uh,

3878
01:52:45,331 --> 01:52:46,050
but he's a man of

3879
01:52:46,050 --> 01:52:46,400
power.

3880
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:46,650
Oh wait,

3881
01:52:46,650 --> 01:52:48,090
that happens all the time.

3882
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:48,570
She does.

3883
01:52:48,570 --> 01:52:49,710
She do in with him.

3884
01:52:49,711 --> 01:52:51,330
That's Susan Anton and Dudley Moore.

3885
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:51,900
I don't know.

3886
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:52,620
Well he's,

3887
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:53,431
he's powerful.

3888
01:52:53,431 --> 01:52:56,610
He's the head of the CIA and she
obviously in writing a book about that is,

3889
01:52:56,611 --> 01:52:57,990
is fascinated by that subject.

3890
01:52:58,230 --> 01:52:59,880
But I think a woman like that,

3891
01:52:59,881 --> 01:53:02,010
if she has access to a man like that,

3892
01:53:02,430 --> 01:53:02,700
he,

3893
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:03,660
he's going to break.

3894
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:04,830
It's just a matter of time.

3895
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:05,863
It's a matter.

3896
01:53:05,950 --> 01:53:09,030
He's going to decide this relationship
is not working out that well and he wore,

3897
01:53:09,031 --> 01:53:11,560
he's going to decide it's
something missing from his wife.

3898
01:53:11,850 --> 01:53:13,290
I love her as a friend,

3899
01:53:13,291 --> 01:53:13,771
but it's just,

3900
01:53:13,771 --> 01:53:14,604
I don't know what to do.

3901
01:53:14,970 --> 01:53:15,571
Power thing.

3902
01:53:15,571 --> 01:53:16,500
I mean these guys,

3903
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:17,730
I think there's this,

3904
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:18,090
this,

3905
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:19,800
you get this sense and you see it with,

3906
01:53:19,801 --> 01:53:21,300
with celebrities all the time.

3907
01:53:21,301 --> 01:53:25,320
This sense get right back to Oj Simpson
that I can get away with anything.

3908
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:25,970
Um,

3909
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:26,240
I'm,

3910
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:27,330
I'm not regular this,

3911
01:53:27,331 --> 01:53:28,980
that only applies to normal people.

3912
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:33,600
Well think that comes from a lot of
people around you that are in a support

3913
01:53:33,601 --> 01:53:36,840
position that are constantly
catering to you and kissing your ass.

3914
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:38,400
I get it all the time.

3915
01:53:38,401 --> 01:53:39,750
Are you kidding man to man?

3916
01:53:40,150 --> 01:53:40,951
As you see a bar,

3917
01:53:40,951 --> 01:53:42,090
a vast staff here,

3918
01:53:42,091 --> 01:53:44,430
number of women you have
circulating around here?

3919
01:53:44,431 --> 01:53:45,020
Yes.

3920
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:45,280
Um,

3921
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:45,570
the,

3922
01:53:45,570 --> 01:53:46,160
the,

3923
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:46,651
the,

3924
01:53:46,651 --> 01:53:46,911
the,

3925
01:53:46,911 --> 01:53:51,660
the celebrity thing is probably tenfold
when you're dealing with a military man

3926
01:53:51,661 --> 01:53:53,280
who's a trained killer,

3927
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:56,660
who's been responsible for
leading armies to battle.

3928
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:56,800
Oh.

3929
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,300
And they live like puff daddy.

3930
01:53:58,301 --> 01:53:58,601
I mean,

3931
01:53:58,601 --> 01:54:00,880
they have limousines and I mean,

3932
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,280
they have the generals live very well.

3933
01:54:03,281 --> 01:54:03,521
I don't,

3934
01:54:03,521 --> 01:54:05,020
I don't mean to begrudge them anything,

3935
01:54:05,021 --> 01:54:06,730
but if you get to the level of general,

3936
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:08,320
it's quite a lifestyle.

3937
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:09,493
Um,

3938
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:09,960
yes.

3939
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:10,200
And,

3940
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:14,470
and it's just as attractive a lifestyle
to some outside entity as any other

3941
01:54:14,471 --> 01:54:14,951
celebrities.

3942
01:54:14,951 --> 01:54:16,330
Like you're not quite Elvis,

3943
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:17,403
but you know.

3944
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:18,140
Yeah.

3945
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:19,090
And again,

3946
01:54:19,091 --> 01:54:19,441
you're,

3947
01:54:19,441 --> 01:54:21,550
you're dealing with a man who's revered,

3948
01:54:22,050 --> 01:54:25,260
who publicly was a hero portrayal.

3949
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:25,780
I mean,

3950
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:28,180
that was the military
guy that you heard of.

3951
01:54:28,181 --> 01:54:29,170
General Petraeus.

3952
01:54:29,290 --> 01:54:30,700
Petraeus is moving the truth.

3953
01:54:30,701 --> 01:54:31,720
Patraeus is doing this.

3954
01:54:31,750 --> 01:54:33,160
How different is this from Clinton?

3955
01:54:33,161 --> 01:54:34,960
Because I always think
with Clinton and Lewinsky,

3956
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:36,790
what are you an idiot?

3957
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:37,870
Do you really think,

3958
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:38,620
first of all,

3959
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:40,930
do you really think that girl's
going to keep her mouth shut?

3960
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:41,410
You know,

3961
01:54:41,410 --> 01:54:42,430
nobody's going to find out.

3962
01:54:42,490 --> 01:54:42,731
I mean,

3963
01:54:42,731 --> 01:54:43,361
to me these are,

3964
01:54:43,361 --> 01:54:44,440
these are flaws.

3965
01:54:44,441 --> 01:54:44,981
Like I said,

3966
01:54:44,981 --> 01:54:48,460
like a Greek tragedy because
the minute you fall for that,

3967
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:49,571
you're done.

3968
01:54:49,571 --> 01:54:49,910
I mean,

3969
01:54:49,910 --> 01:54:53,650
how can you be so smart in every
other respect and yet not there?

3970
01:54:53,710 --> 01:54:53,921
Well,

3971
01:54:53,921 --> 01:54:56,650
Clinton is a freak and I
don't know if you know freaks,

3972
01:54:56,651 --> 01:54:56,861
you know,

3973
01:54:56,861 --> 01:54:57,371
any freaks,

3974
01:54:57,371 --> 01:54:57,551
you know,

3975
01:54:57,551 --> 01:54:58,360
any real freaks.

3976
01:54:58,360 --> 01:55:00,550
I suppose it depends on the definition.

3977
01:55:00,610 --> 01:55:02,110
I have friends that are freaks.

3978
01:55:02,111 --> 01:55:02,650
I have,

3979
01:55:02,650 --> 01:55:04,450
I have dudes that you could,

3980
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:09,130
you could count on them doing something
stupid if given the opportunity,

3981
01:55:09,210 --> 01:55:10,300
everybody in every other way,

3982
01:55:10,301 --> 01:55:11,440
they can be gifted and yeah,

3983
01:55:11,470 --> 01:55:12,280
they can be brilliant.

3984
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:13,510
But when it comes to checks,

3985
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:15,340
some guys just are off.

3986
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:16,331
I could see that.

3987
01:55:16,331 --> 01:55:17,980
And I think Clinton is a freak.

3988
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:21,100
I think you might be writing those
dues that would just pull his dick out.

3989
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:22,270
I think Clinton,

3990
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:23,860
I think he did many times.

3991
01:55:23,861 --> 01:55:24,101
I mean,

3992
01:55:24,101 --> 01:55:25,630
that was the state trooper,

3993
01:55:25,631 --> 01:55:25,971
the uh,

3994
01:55:25,971 --> 01:55:26,441
the police.

3995
01:55:26,441 --> 01:55:27,274
What was her name?

3996
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:27,531
Oh,

3997
01:55:27,531 --> 01:55:28,960
what's a Paula Jones?

3998
01:55:28,990 --> 01:55:30,640
Paula Jones said he's whipped and guy.

3999
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:33,280
Why don't we just pull Paula Jones out?

4000
01:55:33,281 --> 01:55:34,840
That's how big of a
deal it was at the time.

4001
01:55:34,870 --> 01:55:35,150
Well,

4002
01:55:35,150 --> 01:55:35,950
she,

4003
01:55:35,950 --> 01:55:37,530
she is fascinating to me too.

4004
01:55:37,810 --> 01:55:39,960
She eventually went on to do house,

4005
01:55:40,050 --> 01:55:40,490
you know,

4006
01:55:40,490 --> 01:55:40,930
it's like,

4007
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:41,711
oh,

4008
01:55:41,711 --> 01:55:42,460
okay.

4009
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:43,200
What was the other,

4010
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:44,010
who was the blonde?

4011
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,210
Remember the blonds?

4012
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:47,280
There was some Blonde Jessica Flowers.

4013
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:50,200
Okay.

4014
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:50,340
Yeah,

4015
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:50,760
I will,

4016
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:51,121
I could,

4017
01:55:51,121 --> 01:55:51,470
uh,

4018
01:55:51,470 --> 01:55:51,880
yeah,

4019
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:52,440
I,

4020
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:54,300
who's the chick that sent Gary Hart?

4021
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:55,111
Uh,

4022
01:55:55,111 --> 01:55:55,501
hold on,

4023
01:55:55,501 --> 01:55:56,760
I got that one that was,

4024
01:55:56,761 --> 01:55:57,594
um,

4025
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,070
I carry Hart was,

4026
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:00,091
oh,

4027
01:56:00,091 --> 01:56:01,470
so now I'm going to Jim Baker.

4028
01:56:01,471 --> 01:56:03,570
I'm getting her confused
as a John Jessica Hahn,

4029
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:05,033
the,

4030
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:05,491
Oh,

4031
01:56:05,491 --> 01:56:05,810
what was,

4032
01:56:05,810 --> 01:56:06,571
I'll come up with it.

4033
01:56:06,571 --> 01:56:08,400
It was the monkey business
was the name of the boat.

4034
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:09,440
That's another guy that,

4035
01:56:09,441 --> 01:56:10,800
that guy would have been president.

4036
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:13,320
Remember when he did too?

4037
01:56:13,321 --> 01:56:15,060
He dared the media to catch him.

4038
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:15,631
He said,

4039
01:56:15,631 --> 01:56:17,970
if you really think I'm having
an extra marital affair,

4040
01:56:18,210 --> 01:56:19,500
come and find out.

4041
01:56:19,501 --> 01:56:20,161
And it was like,

4042
01:56:20,161 --> 01:56:20,431
okay,

4043
01:56:20,431 --> 01:56:21,264
you're an idiot.

4044
01:56:21,450 --> 01:56:21,930
Dope.

4045
01:56:21,930 --> 01:56:22,410
And they're like,

4046
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:22,831
okay,

4047
01:56:22,831 --> 01:56:23,491
what did he think?

4048
01:56:23,491 --> 01:56:25,470
There was like the camera's only had,

4049
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:26,100
look,

4050
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:28,530
we are a hundred yards out in the water.

4051
01:56:28,531 --> 01:56:29,680
There's no way they could see it.

4052
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:31,470
You're driving me crazy now.

4053
01:56:31,470 --> 01:56:32,570
It's like on the tip of my tongue.

4054
01:56:32,571 --> 01:56:33,420
Who this girl was.

4055
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:34,900
Okay.

4056
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:36,990
Wasn't Marla maples was it was some other,

4057
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:38,280
what was her name?

4058
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:41,010
Know Marla maples was the
chick that was married to,

4059
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:41,310
uh,

4060
01:56:41,310 --> 01:56:42,570
what's his fucking face?

4061
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:47,730
I love with the show is descended to now
we've gone from heavy duty Constitution

4062
01:56:47,730 --> 01:56:47,731
Saana Rice.

4063
01:56:47,731 --> 01:56:48,301
I wasn't there.

4064
01:56:48,301 --> 01:56:49,134
I wasn't close.

4065
01:56:49,190 --> 01:56:50,400
She was so hot though.

4066
01:56:50,401 --> 01:56:50,911
Again.

4067
01:56:50,911 --> 01:56:51,691
She's so hot.

4068
01:56:51,691 --> 01:56:52,980
How is he going to say no to that?

4069
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:53,640
Like Gary,

4070
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:54,391
Gary Hart was,

4071
01:56:54,391 --> 01:56:55,920
he had the same problem Clinton had,

4072
01:56:55,921 --> 01:56:57,110
I mean pussy.

4073
01:56:57,290 --> 01:56:58,800
They're from the John F.

4074
01:56:58,800 --> 01:56:59,820
Kennedy School of Government.

4075
01:57:00,090 --> 01:57:00,331
Yeah.

4076
01:57:00,331 --> 01:57:03,180
There's a picture of her
sitting on his lap on the boat,

4077
01:57:03,181 --> 01:57:03,451
right?

4078
01:57:03,451 --> 01:57:03,601
Yeah.

4079
01:57:03,601 --> 01:57:05,250
And she's got no pants on.

4080
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:06,330
She's got a long shirt.

4081
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:08,640
It's like over the pants and
she's got a drink in our hand.

4082
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,710
Boom party time.

4083
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:12,760
That's why he became a politician.

4084
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:13,933
Bulletproof.

4085
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:15,250
They'll never catch me.

4086
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:17,370
If you think I'm having
an extramarital affair,

4087
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:18,930
tail me and find out.

4088
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,120
And he was running for president
while this was happening,

4089
01:57:21,121 --> 01:57:22,260
not just running for president member.

4090
01:57:22,261 --> 01:57:25,680
We had this conversation about how
weak the competition was at the time.

4091
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:29,160
Gary Hart was huge
compared to the people he,

4092
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:33,450
he would've been running against like
George Bush senior or something and it

4093
01:57:33,451 --> 01:57:36,570
would have been like having
a Kennedy run against Nixon.

4094
01:57:36,571 --> 01:57:38,550
I mean it would have been slam dunk.

4095
01:57:38,551 --> 01:57:40,550
You're in and he taught,

4096
01:57:40,570 --> 01:57:42,240
there's a man who blew the presidency.

4097
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:43,320
It's amazing.

4098
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:46,260
And probably correctly now in hindsight.

4099
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:47,071
Yeah,

4100
01:57:47,071 --> 01:57:48,840
well probably for all of them.

4101
01:57:48,841 --> 01:57:53,841
I mean look again at Kennedy who was
like one of our most loved president and

4102
01:57:55,411 --> 01:57:57,330
this gets back to your thing
about 20 years and say,

4103
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:01,230
do you realize how short a
time Kennedy was in office?

4104
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:02,650
I mean it's like two and him,

4105
01:58:02,651 --> 01:58:04,890
you said he was in the
middle of his first term.

4106
01:58:06,030 --> 01:58:10,050
It would be like Barack Obama
died three years ago or something.

4107
01:58:10,051 --> 01:58:10,321
I mean,

4108
01:58:10,321 --> 01:58:15,300
it's crazy how much the guy gets a
lionized when you really didn't even know

4109
01:58:15,301 --> 01:58:16,380
what you had there yet.

4110
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:16,620
Well,

4111
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:18,390
I mean it's what James Dean,

4112
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:19,370
you know when people die,

4113
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:20,370
people love them.

4114
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:21,960
Oh my mother even says today.

4115
01:58:21,961 --> 01:58:23,580
I mean you were just in trance.

4116
01:58:23,581 --> 01:58:25,110
She was entranced by the guy.

4117
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:25,861
By James Dean.

4118
01:58:25,861 --> 01:58:26,161
No,

4119
01:58:26,161 --> 01:58:26,994
by Kennedy.

4120
01:58:27,930 --> 01:58:30,150
Well he was the first guy that seemed,

4121
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:32,880
first of all to be a regular person.

4122
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:33,930
He seemed to come on.

4123
01:58:33,931 --> 01:58:37,020
He was also a movie star was it was Nixon,

4124
01:58:37,021 --> 01:58:38,760
Eisenhower and John F.

4125
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:38,761
Kennedy.

4126
01:58:38,761 --> 01:58:40,740
I mean he was certainly handsome guy,

4127
01:58:40,741 --> 01:58:44,320
but what I mean by a regular person
was he didn't seem like a liar.

4128
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:48,070
He didn't seem like a co like Nixon
seemed like a piece of plastic.

4129
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:52,390
It's like you're looking at a guy with
a two dimensional mask in front of them

4130
01:58:52,391 --> 01:58:55,740
that never gave you who he really
was and was just a slip rate.

4131
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:56,770
He was funny too.

4132
01:58:56,771 --> 01:58:58,930
I mean if you listen to him and
like off the cuff discussion,

4133
01:58:59,070 --> 01:58:59,903
right man,

4134
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:01,180
fall down funny.

4135
01:59:01,181 --> 01:59:02,850
I mean he had this witty dry sensing.

4136
01:59:03,310 --> 01:59:04,900
I mean people were putty in his hands.

4137
01:59:04,901 --> 01:59:06,850
We haven't had a president
that funny since.

4138
01:59:06,851 --> 01:59:09,580
We really haven't no nowhere
near that high level.

4139
01:59:09,581 --> 01:59:10,900
I mean the guy was the kind of,

4140
01:59:10,930 --> 01:59:14,110
well and Frank Sinatra and all those
guys used to party with him cause he

4141
01:59:14,111 --> 01:59:17,640
Kennedy was a fun guy on a bunch of
different levels and they love themselves

4142
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:20,110
and love themselves to posting.

4143
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:22,840
Robert was the more
serious of the of the guys.

4144
01:59:22,841 --> 01:59:23,111
And you know,

4145
01:59:23,111 --> 01:59:25,780
he had an older brother that was the
guy they were really grooming for the

4146
01:59:25,781 --> 01:59:26,614
presidency.

4147
01:59:26,710 --> 01:59:30,760
Joe was his older brother's name and
he died on a World War II mission.

4148
01:59:30,761 --> 01:59:34,120
And the family was like crushed because
they'd spent all the time grooming Joe

4149
01:59:34,121 --> 01:59:37,150
to be the presidential guy and now of
course they're going to have to go to

4150
01:59:37,151 --> 01:59:38,770
number two and number two was jack.

4151
01:59:38,890 --> 01:59:39,610
Wow.

4152
01:59:39,610 --> 01:59:42,520
He died on one of those missions where
he was going to volunteer to take a

4153
01:59:42,521 --> 01:59:47,440
bomber into like some really hardcore
clandestine thing and the bomber takes off

4154
01:59:47,441 --> 01:59:49,990
and it's like just in the sky and
the whole thing just explodes.

4155
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:50,950
Oh Wow.

4156
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:51,220
Yeah.

4157
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:51,791
So that's how,

4158
01:59:51,791 --> 01:59:52,181
and you know,

4159
01:59:52,181 --> 01:59:56,290
John was involved in that PT
109 thing with his bad back.

4160
01:59:56,291 --> 02:00:00,610
And I mean all those guys you think about
what they did as lightweight as John

4161
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:00,610
F.

4162
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:00,791
Kennedy was.

4163
02:00:00,791 --> 02:00:04,570
Can you imagine Clinton out there
on the PT boat and were award too?

4164
02:00:04,571 --> 02:00:05,730
I mean it just doesn't even reach it.

4165
02:00:05,731 --> 02:00:08,970
It was almost a requirement back then
to be president that you had served some

4166
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:09,510
ACA.

4167
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:10,260
It really was.

4168
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:10,511
It really,

4169
02:00:10,511 --> 02:00:12,070
it's amazing how that sort of change.

4170
02:00:12,071 --> 02:00:14,350
Wouldn't society accepted Bush?

4171
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:14,711
Well,

4172
02:00:14,711 --> 02:00:16,480
the drug when they accepted
the whole draft dot,

4173
02:00:16,510 --> 02:00:17,650
but you get to the baby boomers,

4174
02:00:17,651 --> 02:00:21,010
you're ruling out a heck of a lot of
people and everybody went through that war

4175
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:21,170
too.

4176
02:00:21,170 --> 02:00:21,910
That's the other thing.

4177
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:24,730
How many people were you going to find
that weren't in World War II and if you

4178
02:00:24,731 --> 02:00:25,570
weren't you in World War II,

4179
02:00:25,571 --> 02:00:27,790
you were a psycho or a flat foot.

4180
02:00:27,791 --> 02:00:28,630
I'm even flat footed.

4181
02:00:28,631 --> 02:00:31,690
Guys were making it into World
War Two when he got to Vietnam,

4182
02:00:31,691 --> 02:00:32,011
it's a,

4183
02:00:32,011 --> 02:00:32,850
it got to be a,

4184
02:00:32,851 --> 02:00:34,840
it's so much different
because people are like,

4185
02:00:34,841 --> 02:00:35,051
well,

4186
02:00:35,051 --> 02:00:36,270
it was a stupid fucking war.

4187
02:00:36,271 --> 02:00:38,620
It's a war we should have never been
involved with in the first place.

4188
02:00:38,621 --> 02:00:39,820
Who wants to be in Vietnam.

4189
02:00:39,821 --> 02:00:40,031
You know,

4190
02:00:40,031 --> 02:00:40,560
if I,

4191
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:41,680
I was alive back then,

4192
02:00:41,681 --> 02:00:43,060
I probably would have dodged the draft.

4193
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:44,350
We still had people like that.

4194
02:00:44,351 --> 02:00:45,011
Carrie was there,

4195
02:00:45,011 --> 02:00:45,880
McCain was there.

4196
02:00:45,881 --> 02:00:46,360
And uh,

4197
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:49,660
and yet guys like Gore who was writing
in like the Stars and Stripes newspaper

4198
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:51,130
in Vietnam when he was doing,

4199
02:00:51,131 --> 02:00:51,970
he was a journalist.

4200
02:00:51,971 --> 02:00:52,630
Yeah.

4201
02:00:52,630 --> 02:00:53,170
Military.

4202
02:00:53,170 --> 02:00:54,160
You're like the dude in a,

4203
02:00:54,161 --> 02:00:56,590
like a Matthew Modine
and full metal jacket.

4204
02:00:57,130 --> 02:00:57,550
I don't,

4205
02:00:57,550 --> 02:00:57,851
you know,

4206
02:00:57,851 --> 02:00:58,720
I don't remember.

4207
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:00,240
I actually saw full metal jacket.

4208
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:00,761
I don't remember.

4209
02:01:00,761 --> 02:01:01,630
So that's a bad night.

4210
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:03,250
Matthew Modine was the,

4211
02:01:03,251 --> 02:01:03,910
uh,

4212
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:04,301
you know,

4213
02:01:04,301 --> 02:01:05,530
the dude for vision quest.

4214
02:01:05,531 --> 02:01:06,340
The,

4215
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:06,900
the,

4216
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:07,300
he,

4217
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:08,290
the guy with glasses,

4218
02:01:08,291 --> 02:01:08,740
he,

4219
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:08,891
oh,

4220
02:01:08,891 --> 02:01:09,551
I know who he is.

4221
02:01:09,551 --> 02:01:10,570
I just don't remember the role.

4222
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:12,880
His role was a journalist.

4223
02:01:12,881 --> 02:01:14,020
He was over there a,

4224
02:01:14,030 --> 02:01:15,880
he went through boot camp and everything.

4225
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:16,301
Like Gore.

4226
02:01:16,301 --> 02:01:18,400
His Dad was a senator
and the whole thing was,

4227
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:21,020
they were thinking about as
his future politics will,

4228
02:01:21,030 --> 02:01:21,261
you know,

4229
02:01:21,261 --> 02:01:22,720
you'd have to keep the war.

4230
02:01:22,721 --> 02:01:23,021
You're going to,

4231
02:01:23,021 --> 02:01:23,854
what about your politics?

4232
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:25,000
So he went and he got,

4233
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:25,161
you know,

4234
02:01:25,161 --> 02:01:26,080
one of the cush jobs.

4235
02:01:26,081 --> 02:01:27,220
Vietnam is famous for that.

4236
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:27,461
Well,

4237
02:01:27,461 --> 02:01:31,150
Gordon had his moment with a massage
therapist claimed that there was more than

4238
02:01:31,151 --> 02:01:31,481
one,

4239
02:01:31,481 --> 02:01:32,540
actually more than that.

4240
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:34,780
So that's his move I used do.

4241
02:01:34,781 --> 02:01:36,880
It's that careful side doors moves.

4242
02:01:36,881 --> 02:01:37,690
Yes.

4243
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:39,890
You know these dudes that kept massages,

4244
02:01:39,891 --> 02:01:39,980
I

4245
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:42,170
don't know turf off before
you get your massage.

4246
02:01:42,580 --> 02:01:44,370
I have a better point
again and it gets to that,

4247
02:01:44,371 --> 02:01:45,500
that being smart thing.

4248
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:47,300
If you're in Gore's position,

4249
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:50,060
don't you want to have like
a third party witness there?

4250
02:01:50,061 --> 02:01:51,500
Because even if you did nothing,

4251
02:01:51,501 --> 02:01:52,334
aren't you opening?

4252
02:01:52,350 --> 02:01:53,730
You know why?

4253
02:01:53,731 --> 02:01:54,110
Why?

4254
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:57,500
Because he wants to get jerked off and
if there's a third party that you're not

4255
02:01:57,501 --> 02:01:59,660
going to get jerked off to
make it a close friend and,

4256
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:00,621
but here's the thing,

4257
02:02:00,621 --> 02:02:02,360
he's getting jerked off on a regular.

4258
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:03,050
That's what I bet.

4259
02:02:03,050 --> 02:02:04,550
I think you need to have him on the show.

4260
02:02:04,551 --> 02:02:06,620
That's a poignant
question you can ask him.

4261
02:02:06,770 --> 02:02:07,101
You know,

4262
02:02:07,101 --> 02:02:11,000
since I brought it up like that
in the podcast on the Internet,

4263
02:02:11,001 --> 02:02:12,170
I'm sure he'll respond.

4264
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:12,920
I'm sure.

4265
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:13,490
I mean,

4266
02:02:13,490 --> 02:02:13,851
you know,

4267
02:02:13,851 --> 02:02:14,684
he has a Twitter,

4268
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:15,710
he'll hear about this.

4269
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:16,190
I'm sure.

4270
02:02:16,190 --> 02:02:18,470
I'm sure it'll be an
interesting conversation,

4271
02:02:18,471 --> 02:02:19,304
won't it?

4272
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:20,241
And I'll say to him,

4273
02:02:20,241 --> 02:02:21,110
first and foremost,

4274
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:22,550
everyone likes getting jerked off.

4275
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:23,870
It's nothing to feel bad about.

4276
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:25,490
And if we were living in China,

4277
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:27,350
that would be a normal
part of your massage.

4278
02:02:27,370 --> 02:02:28,101
And once again,

4279
02:02:28,101 --> 02:02:29,030
we're in the woods now.

4280
02:02:29,031 --> 02:02:29,331
Rogan,

4281
02:02:29,331 --> 02:02:31,310
this shows taking a left
hand turn the woods.

4282
02:02:31,311 --> 02:02:32,030
This is where we land.

4283
02:02:32,030 --> 02:02:32,260
I know,

4284
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:33,040
I know.

4285
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:36,740
I have ventured into the woods with 13
miles down a dirt road and your car just

4286
02:02:36,741 --> 02:02:40,280
broke down with a tarp to keep the
rain out and we sleep under it.

4287
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:41,391
Yeah.

4288
02:02:41,391 --> 02:02:43,700
I don't think there's anything wrong
with getting jerked off and I don't think

4289
02:02:43,701 --> 02:02:44,534
he should feel bad.

4290
02:02:44,570 --> 02:02:46,100
I think if you're going to get a massage,

4291
02:02:46,101 --> 02:02:47,630
you're basically getting
jerked off anyway.

4292
02:02:47,810 --> 02:02:47,961
I mean,

4293
02:02:47,961 --> 02:02:48,231
what do you,

4294
02:02:48,231 --> 02:02:48,471
what do you,

4295
02:02:48,471 --> 02:02:49,304
what does a massage,

4296
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:51,470
ice and deal with this guy?

4297
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:53,210
Was any of this coming up with Tyson?

4298
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:54,043
I didn't see the show.

4299
02:02:54,190 --> 02:02:54,891
We talked about,

4300
02:02:54,891 --> 02:02:55,070
um,

4301
02:02:55,070 --> 02:02:55,431
my,

4302
02:02:55,431 --> 02:02:55,650
uh,

4303
02:02:55,650 --> 02:02:57,170
fart theory of aliens.

4304
02:02:57,171 --> 02:02:57,411
We did.

4305
02:02:57,411 --> 02:02:59,200
We talked about some and
he went there with you.

4306
02:02:59,360 --> 02:02:59,620
He's,

4307
02:02:59,620 --> 02:03:00,140
he's awesome.

4308
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:00,551
I'm,

4309
02:03:00,551 --> 02:03:00,811
I'm,

4310
02:03:00,811 --> 02:03:01,250
I'm,

4311
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:01,881
I'm pleased.

4312
02:03:01,881 --> 02:03:02,760
I don't feel bad anymore.

4313
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:02,930
Oh,

4314
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:03,800
you shouldn't feel bad.

4315
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:04,841
The Internet.

4316
02:03:04,841 --> 02:03:05,601
We're grown men.

4317
02:03:05,601 --> 02:03:06,351
We're fathers.

4318
02:03:06,351 --> 02:03:10,160
We're taxpayers were law abiding citizens
were allowed to talk about anybody

4319
02:03:10,161 --> 02:03:12,500
knows getting jerked
off in a hotel room by,

4320
02:03:12,501 --> 02:03:14,720
I'm assume he's in a
country where that's legal.

4321
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:15,730
He should be able to pay that.

4322
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:16,521
It's like,

4323
02:03:16,521 --> 02:03:16,821
what is it?

4324
02:03:16,821 --> 02:03:17,654
An extra hundred bucks.

4325
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:18,561
What's the difference?

4326
02:03:18,561 --> 02:03:20,960
He rubbing someone's dirty
feet and rubbing their dick.

4327
02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:21,650
You know,

4328
02:03:21,650 --> 02:03:24,290
some people would probably be happier
to rub your Dick then you're dirty feet.

4329
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:25,440
I wouldn't know anything of a,

4330
02:03:25,441 --> 02:03:25,881
you're just,

4331
02:03:25,881 --> 02:03:27,380
see my wife's probably watching this,

4332
02:03:27,381 --> 02:03:27,531
right.

4333
02:03:27,531 --> 02:03:28,580
I don't know what you're talking.

4334
02:03:28,581 --> 02:03:29,630
If I understand well,

4335
02:03:29,631 --> 02:03:30,880
I'm not saying that you should do that,

4336
02:03:30,910 --> 02:03:32,150
nor do I want it or need it.

4337
02:03:32,180 --> 02:03:33,980
When I'm saying is there's a man,

4338
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:38,390
if the man wants to get jerked off and
he wants to go to a hotel and pay for

4339
02:03:38,391 --> 02:03:39,770
that poor,

4340
02:03:39,771 --> 02:03:40,221
poor,

4341
02:03:40,221 --> 02:03:41,150
poor Al Gore,

4342
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:43,130
unless his name is Petraeus.

4343
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:43,761
Yeah.

4344
02:03:43,761 --> 02:03:43,911
Well,

4345
02:03:43,911 --> 02:03:44,600
he wasn't just,

4346
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:47,450
he was getting his freak on
100% he was in a relationship.

4347
02:03:47,451 --> 02:03:48,140
He was in love.

4348
02:03:48,140 --> 02:03:49,730
That's why what happened was,

4349
02:03:49,731 --> 02:03:50,421
you know the whole story,

4350
02:03:50,421 --> 02:03:55,160
that other woman who's a also sketchy
and sort of slutty on a dirty Washington

4351
02:03:55,161 --> 02:03:55,790
groupies.

4352
02:03:55,790 --> 02:03:56,350
Yeah.

4353
02:03:56,350 --> 02:03:56,901
What was her name?

4354
02:03:56,901 --> 02:03:58,130
That the chicken Florida.

4355
02:03:58,550 --> 02:04:00,110
Which one is the other Patraeus one.

4356
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:01,260
I'm not up to speed on it.

4357
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:01,490
Okay.

4358
02:04:01,490 --> 02:04:02,900
That's the whole betray situation.

4359
02:04:02,901 --> 02:04:03,770
There's two girls,

4360
02:04:03,950 --> 02:04:08,950
one girl who was in Florida
who was getting emailed by
the old light and she is

4361
02:04:09,021 --> 02:04:09,854
for sure.

4362
02:04:10,010 --> 02:04:12,860
And she's in that Group B group
that goes after all the generals.

4363
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:16,340
You're the general's wife.

4364
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:17,091
What do you do?

4365
02:04:17,091 --> 02:04:18,710
And letting them go to
the group he meetings.

4366
02:04:18,711 --> 02:04:19,530
That's what I want to know.

4367
02:04:19,530 --> 02:04:23,120
She probably doesn't know that there's
together for generals outrageously.

4368
02:04:23,121 --> 02:04:23,391
I mean,

4369
02:04:23,391 --> 02:04:24,224
you know,

4370
02:04:24,450 --> 02:04:26,090
you don't want to let
him anywhere near that.

4371
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:27,380
Well this girl was a,

4372
02:04:27,381 --> 02:04:32,381
this woman was married and her and the
husband were both like really into like

4373
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:38,070
celebrity military functions and
military parties and they would both

4374
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:41,910
be into that social socialite
sort of military social world.

4375
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:43,110
So it wasn't,

4376
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:44,760
it wasn't that cut and dry,

4377
02:04:44,761 --> 02:04:45,090
wasn't it?

4378
02:04:45,090 --> 02:04:47,490
Like the weirdest goes on more than
you would think in those groups.

4379
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:51,000
I happened to know some people that would
have been astronauts had it not been

4380
02:04:51,001 --> 02:04:54,540
for going after the wives of people
who are ranked higher than they were.

4381
02:04:54,541 --> 02:04:55,081
So I mean this,

4382
02:04:55,081 --> 02:04:55,440
this,

4383
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,450
this stuff has been going on forever.

4384
02:04:57,510 --> 02:04:58,530
It's always going to go on.

4385
02:04:58,531 --> 02:04:59,790
You're talking about trained killers,

4386
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:00,181
you know,

4387
02:05:00,181 --> 02:05:01,530
I have friends that,

4388
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:02,281
you know,

4389
02:05:02,281 --> 02:05:05,760
we're in various branches of the
military would tell me the wild,

4390
02:05:05,761 --> 02:05:07,740
crazy fucking stories about war time.

4391
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:08,420
You know,

4392
02:05:08,420 --> 02:05:09,001
dudes,

4393
02:05:09,001 --> 02:05:09,480
you know,

4394
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:10,560
hey look scans.

4395
02:05:10,561 --> 02:05:11,490
I mean these are just party,

4396
02:05:11,491 --> 02:05:13,380
state side with guys
who aren't even at war.

4397
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:15,540
I mean it's a culture by the way,

4398
02:05:15,541 --> 02:05:16,590
you don't know if you're going to die.

4399
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:17,041
You know,

4400
02:05:17,041 --> 02:05:17,321
you're,

4401
02:05:17,321 --> 02:05:17,460
you're,

4402
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:21,630
you're over there in involved in the
scariest thing you could ever be involved

4403
02:05:21,631 --> 02:05:22,620
in an actual war.

4404
02:05:22,890 --> 02:05:26,460
Bombs and planes and rocket
launchers and grenades.

4405
02:05:26,461 --> 02:05:27,990
And these are also hard drinking,

4406
02:05:27,991 --> 02:05:28,321
hard,

4407
02:05:28,321 --> 02:05:28,711
partying,

4408
02:05:28,711 --> 02:05:29,910
hard exercising.

4409
02:05:29,911 --> 02:05:31,470
Like I was just talking
to one guy last night.

4410
02:05:31,471 --> 02:05:31,920
He's like,

4411
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:32,880
we get up in the morning,

4412
02:05:32,970 --> 02:05:34,140
you run 10 miles,

4413
02:05:34,230 --> 02:05:35,610
you go work hard all day,

4414
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:36,361
you're done with the day.

4415
02:05:36,361 --> 02:05:38,670
You go out and you drink
as hard as you work.

4416
02:05:38,671 --> 02:05:39,504
You know what I mean?

4417
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:42,720
It's sort of a cultural thing and you
know what you want to let down after a

4418
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:43,350
hard day at work.

4419
02:05:43,350 --> 02:05:45,360
My Dad works not as hard as those guys.

4420
02:05:45,361 --> 02:05:50,160
I mean if the letting down is in is
in proportion to how hard the day was,

4421
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:50,791
you know,

4422
02:05:50,791 --> 02:05:52,800
you're going to need a lot
more beers than I would need.

4423
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:53,221
Yeah.

4424
02:05:53,221 --> 02:05:54,450
Let Al Gore get jerked off.

4425
02:05:54,451 --> 02:05:55,284
That's what I'm saying.

4426
02:05:55,530 --> 02:05:56,610
That's exactly what I'm saying.

4427
02:05:57,030 --> 02:05:59,760
Why you hating on Al
Gore and John Travolta?

4428
02:05:59,761 --> 02:06:03,300
John Travolta makes movies about war
and I think he should get jerked off to,

4429
02:06:03,301 --> 02:06:04,970
I think it's absolutely commiserate.

4430
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:05,813
That's right.

4431
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:06,331
Look,

4432
02:06:06,331 --> 02:06:07,420
it's not that it's commensurate,

4433
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:10,710
but in order for him to
play the role correctly,

4434
02:06:10,711 --> 02:06:11,301
I think he's got,

4435
02:06:11,301 --> 02:06:12,570
he was just research for a part.

4436
02:06:12,571 --> 02:06:13,404
Absolutely.

4437
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:14,293
Yeah.

4438
02:06:14,370 --> 02:06:14,761
What else?

4439
02:06:14,761 --> 02:06:18,780
What do you want the guy to do to just
pretend and to sort of fill in the blanks

4440
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:20,700
with his lack of personal experience?

4441
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:23,100
I think that's what it must've been.

4442
02:06:23,370 --> 02:06:24,050
Yeah.

4443
02:06:24,050 --> 02:06:24,540
Um,

4444
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:26,190
lack of personal experience.

4445
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:27,660
I'm just researching again.

4446
02:06:27,690 --> 02:06:28,830
What do you think about,

4447
02:06:28,831 --> 02:06:31,050
this is something that I really
want to make sure that we touch on.

4448
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:31,710
Um,

4449
02:06:31,710 --> 02:06:33,180
and bringing it back to Al Gore,

4450
02:06:33,181 --> 02:06:33,930
believe it or not,

4451
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:34,561
but in a,

4452
02:06:34,561 --> 02:06:35,400
in a serious way,

4453
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:40,730
the Hbo Documentary Hacking Democracy
when over the issue with the Diebold,

4454
02:06:41,590 --> 02:06:42,020
uh,

4455
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:42,250
you,

4456
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:42,381
yeah,

4457
02:06:42,381 --> 02:06:47,010
the voting machines machines and how they
can be influenced by a third party and

4458
02:06:47,011 --> 02:06:49,980
third party information besides
the person counting the vote,

4459
02:06:49,981 --> 02:06:51,180
the person making the vote.

4460
02:06:51,350 --> 02:06:51,961
Third Party.

4461
02:06:51,961 --> 02:06:53,100
There was room for a third party.

4462
02:06:53,550 --> 02:06:53,990
And,

4463
02:06:53,990 --> 02:06:54,410
um,

4464
02:06:54,410 --> 02:06:54,690
they,

4465
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:57,090
they talked about how disturbing
that was and how it hit.

4466
02:06:57,120 --> 02:07:02,120
It had been engineered for
that and they essentially said,

4467
02:07:02,221 --> 02:07:02,610
look,

4468
02:07:02,610 --> 02:07:03,330
it's,

4469
02:07:03,330 --> 02:07:04,081
you could,

4470
02:07:04,081 --> 02:07:04,920
you could rig a vote.

4471
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:06,083
You could rig it.

4472
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:06,510
Um,

4473
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:06,811
what do you,

4474
02:07:06,811 --> 02:07:07,890
what do you think about all that?

4475
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:09,631
When you mentioned that,

4476
02:07:09,631 --> 02:07:13,370
all I can think about is how is
this flying under the conversation?

4477
02:07:14,650 --> 02:07:15,080
You want,

4478
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:15,900
you want one of the,

4479
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:16,231
okay,

4480
02:07:16,231 --> 02:07:17,820
if you want to get down on anybody,

4481
02:07:17,821 --> 02:07:20,040
let's get down on the journalist
who aren't doing their job.

4482
02:07:20,041 --> 02:07:20,370
That's,

4483
02:07:20,370 --> 02:07:21,660
that used to be my profession,

4484
02:07:21,990 --> 02:07:26,990
these wimpy kiss ass journalists who
want to hang out afterwards behind the

4485
02:07:27,811 --> 02:07:28,411
velvet rope,

4486
02:07:28,411 --> 02:07:29,310
but the people they cover.

4487
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:32,490
The question to ask the president and
the other candidates is everything.

4488
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:34,350
What do you think about
this voting machines?

4489
02:07:34,351 --> 02:07:34,650
Are you,

4490
02:07:34,650 --> 02:07:35,490
you know what you tell,

4491
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:36,190
ask

4492
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:36,850
them.

4493
02:07:36,850 --> 02:07:38,200
Let's get their opinion.

4494
02:07:38,201 --> 02:07:39,034
Make them come.

4495
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:44,180
You know the old line was make them go
on the record to these guys are able to

4496
02:07:44,591 --> 02:07:46,390
say basically on the sly,

4497
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:50,560
if you ask me any questions beyond these
five things I have on this list right

4498
02:07:50,561 --> 02:07:51,010
here,

4499
02:07:51,010 --> 02:07:54,250
you're never coming to another function
again and I won't answer your question

4500
02:07:54,251 --> 02:07:54,820
anyway.

4501
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:56,530
You won't even get the
satisfaction of saying,

4502
02:07:56,531 --> 02:07:56,651
well,

4503
02:07:56,651 --> 02:07:58,570
I got an answer before I
was kicked out of the room.

4504
02:07:58,690 --> 02:08:02,200
You don't get your question answered
and you never get to come back.

4505
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:03,670
And that works now.

4506
02:08:03,970 --> 02:08:08,620
I mean in the Cold War they used to cut
some slack of the politicians on certain

4507
02:08:08,621 --> 02:08:12,010
kinds of questions and there
were certain manly rules like,

4508
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:13,480
I mean everybody knew John F.

4509
02:08:13,480 --> 02:08:16,570
Kennedy was having all these affairs and
it was not considered to be proper to

4510
02:08:16,571 --> 02:08:17,141
bring that up,

4511
02:08:17,141 --> 02:08:19,960
which is crazy when you consider
the potential for blackmail.

4512
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:21,040
But nonetheless,

4513
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:21,550
um,

4514
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:22,930
that sort of stuff was off the record.

4515
02:08:22,931 --> 02:08:25,600
But you get some damn tough
questions on other things.

4516
02:08:25,810 --> 02:08:26,860
We don't have that today.

4517
02:08:26,861 --> 02:08:27,431
And if you want to say,

4518
02:08:27,431 --> 02:08:30,430
how does the country get as bad as it
does without anyone talking about it?

4519
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:34,900
That's because our so called fourth
estate who plays a constitutional watchdog

4520
02:08:34,901 --> 02:08:36,790
role in our system isn't doing that.

4521
02:08:37,420 --> 02:08:38,320
Our fourth estate,

4522
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:39,190
that's what the,

4523
02:08:39,190 --> 02:08:40,023
that's what the,

4524
02:08:40,030 --> 02:08:42,040
there are three estates of
government that are official.

4525
02:08:42,041 --> 02:08:43,420
You have the executive branch,

4526
02:08:43,421 --> 02:08:45,280
the judicial branch and
the legislative branch.

4527
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:48,410
Those are the three estates that work
from inside the government and they're

4528
02:08:48,430 --> 02:08:50,110
officially constitutional branches.

4529
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:54,700
The fourth estate is a term used to
describe a non constitutional branch,

4530
02:08:54,730 --> 02:08:56,200
a nongovernmental branch,

4531
02:08:56,410 --> 02:09:00,010
the watchdogs who watched the
government from outside the government.

4532
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:01,040
And that's the meeting.

4533
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:01,311
Well,

4534
02:09:01,311 --> 02:09:02,330
don't you think though,

4535
02:09:02,331 --> 02:09:06,170
that with this new access to information
that we're enjoying because of the

4536
02:09:06,171 --> 02:09:06,531
internet,

4537
02:09:06,531 --> 02:09:08,810
what's also rising is shows like yours,

4538
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:10,100
the young Turks,

4539
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:10,670
you know,

4540
02:09:10,670 --> 02:09:13,730
people who are openly,

4541
02:09:13,790 --> 02:09:16,520
actively questioning every single aspect.

4542
02:09:16,750 --> 02:09:17,220
Yes.

4543
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:19,830
But let me tell you the difference
because you're absolutely right and thank

4544
02:09:19,831 --> 02:09:20,240
goodness.

4545
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:20,490
Um,

4546
02:09:20,490 --> 02:09:21,960
and thank goodness you
brought that up Joe.

4547
02:09:22,230 --> 02:09:22,650
Um,

4548
02:09:22,650 --> 02:09:23,730
but here's the difference.

4549
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:26,670
We don't have access to the sea here.

4550
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:29,940
When CNN officially cut their
investigative reporting budget,

4551
02:09:29,941 --> 02:09:30,511
which is a joke,

4552
02:09:30,511 --> 02:09:33,030
and he would cause they weren't doing
any investigative reporting worth a salt

4553
02:09:33,031 --> 02:09:33,864
anyway,

4554
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:38,280
they got rid of the stuff that
provides the basis of information.

4555
02:09:38,281 --> 02:09:38,971
I don't mean to CNN,

4556
02:09:38,971 --> 02:09:39,804
I mean everywhere.

4557
02:09:39,900 --> 02:09:42,150
The investigative reporting is how we,

4558
02:09:42,151 --> 02:09:44,220
whether you're talking about me
or the young Turks or anyone else,

4559
02:09:44,430 --> 02:09:48,390
that's where we get our info that
allows us to then comment on it.

4560
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:51,810
I'm not out doing the
investigative work that is,

4561
02:09:51,811 --> 02:09:52,140
you know,

4562
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:52,620
um,

4563
02:09:52,620 --> 02:09:56,040
there's a reason that the very first
amendment to the constitution protects

4564
02:09:56,041 --> 02:09:57,240
freedom of the press.

4565
02:09:57,480 --> 02:10:01,080
And it's not because someone thinks you
have should have the right to tail some

4566
02:10:01,081 --> 02:10:05,700
celebrity for TMZ because we just have
to know who they're dating on the side.

4567
02:10:05,970 --> 02:10:09,270
It's because this is considered
to be of national import.

4568
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:11,220
The country goes to hell in a hand basket.

4569
02:10:11,221 --> 02:10:15,210
If you don't know what's going
on and really what's going on,

4570
02:10:15,870 --> 02:10:19,740
the 1970s are turning out to be the
high watermark of American journalism.

4571
02:10:19,890 --> 02:10:21,510
When you look at what was going on,

4572
02:10:21,511 --> 02:10:22,380
then you try and run and go.

4573
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:26,100
You can't imagine that happening today
and that's totally the opposite of what

4574
02:10:26,101 --> 02:10:26,761
you normally expect.

4575
02:10:26,761 --> 02:10:28,530
Normally you expect
everything to get better.

4576
02:10:29,070 --> 02:10:32,970
the 70s from a news standpoint was so
much better than what we have now in terms

4577
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:33,591
expos,

4578
02:10:33,591 --> 02:10:37,340
A's and people getting nailed
and that's Pre-internet.

4579
02:10:37,550 --> 02:10:41,810
If you took that level of dedication
to investigative reporting,

4580
02:10:41,811 --> 02:10:45,140
it's all the post Watergate era stuff
when everybody was going in and the way

4581
02:10:45,141 --> 02:10:48,320
you made your bones in journalism was
to try to be Woodward and Bernstein.

4582
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:49,933
I'll tell you a story.

4583
02:10:50,270 --> 02:10:52,130
When I got my first job in reporting,

4584
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:55,410
I went from here in la where I was
working on the assignment desk,

4585
02:10:55,530 --> 02:10:57,230
know behind the scenes to work in,

4586
02:10:57,231 --> 02:11:00,500
in front of the camera and the first
thing that happens that that makes you

4587
02:11:00,501 --> 02:11:04,310
upset as a reporter is they'll send you
to like the dog show and the knife show

4588
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:05,570
and all these things where you're going,

4589
02:11:05,571 --> 02:11:06,890
this is why I got into news.

4590
02:11:06,891 --> 02:11:08,630
I want some meaty stories so I get my,

4591
02:11:08,810 --> 02:11:10,760
I get my hands on my first meaty story.

4592
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:13,880
Members of the sheriff's department
call me up on the slide and they start

4593
02:11:13,881 --> 02:11:15,680
telling me what the
sheriff is doing secretly,

4594
02:11:15,681 --> 02:11:16,370
right?

4595
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:19,850
I jump on this story takes
weeks to flesh this thing out,

4596
02:11:19,851 --> 02:11:20,031
right?

4597
02:11:20,031 --> 02:11:21,560
It's totally non cost effective.

4598
02:11:21,830 --> 02:11:22,790
I break the story.

4599
02:11:22,791 --> 02:11:23,840
It's this big deal.

4600
02:11:23,841 --> 02:11:27,260
Everybody's on it and the news director
gives me an award because he has to

4601
02:11:27,261 --> 02:11:28,190
because it's this big deal,

4602
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:32,840
but then he takes me in the office
privately and tears me a new one and says,

4603
02:11:32,841 --> 02:11:33,980
don't you ever do that again?

4604
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:34,761
I said,

4605
02:11:34,761 --> 02:11:34,891
well,

4606
02:11:34,891 --> 02:11:35,870
what am I supposed to be doing?

4607
02:11:35,871 --> 02:11:36,470
He says,

4608
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:38,750
now the sheriff is never going
to give us a story again.

4609
02:11:38,751 --> 02:11:40,160
They're never going to talk to us again.

4610
02:11:40,190 --> 02:11:41,870
You just burned our bridge with them.

4611
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:42,471
Well,

4612
02:11:42,471 --> 02:11:42,921
wait a minute,

4613
02:11:42,921 --> 02:11:44,690
the guys involved in illegal activities.

4614
02:11:44,870 --> 02:11:45,141
Yeah,

4615
02:11:45,141 --> 02:11:48,650
but there's 57 stories we need to
do down the road where we need their

4616
02:11:48,651 --> 02:11:50,360
cooperation and now they're
not going to help us.

4617
02:11:50,690 --> 02:11:51,800
That's what's happened.

4618
02:11:52,190 --> 02:11:52,670
And that's,

4619
02:11:52,670 --> 02:11:52,881
you know,

4620
02:11:52,881 --> 02:11:54,410
on the national scale it's the same thing.

4621
02:11:54,411 --> 02:11:56,840
They don't want to be Woodward Bernstein
because Woodward and Bernstein are

4622
02:11:56,841 --> 02:11:58,220
getting another interview
with the president.

4623
02:11:58,720 --> 02:11:58,931
Yeah,

4624
02:11:58,931 --> 02:11:59,381
that's a,

4625
02:11:59,381 --> 02:12:00,220
that's a very,

4626
02:12:00,221 --> 02:12:05,110
very good point about how this whole
thing sort of gets more and more complex

4627
02:12:05,111 --> 02:12:05,690
and more,

4628
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:06,900
more so you can have the internet,

4629
02:12:06,901 --> 02:12:09,780
but if anonymous doesn't tell us and
release cables of what's going on,

4630
02:12:09,781 --> 02:12:12,870
who did the investigative work to give
us enough information for me to comment?

4631
02:12:12,900 --> 02:12:14,370
How do you feel about wikileaks?

4632
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:16,380
I disagree with,

4633
02:12:16,381 --> 02:12:18,600
but from what I can tell
from the angry emails,

4634
02:12:18,601 --> 02:12:20,280
90% of my audience on that,

4635
02:12:20,590 --> 02:12:25,590
cause I think he looked in a world of
the 1970s if we could have a media that

4636
02:12:25,801 --> 02:12:26,640
used to do its job,

4637
02:12:26,641 --> 02:12:27,610
we don't need a wikileaks.

4638
02:12:28,090 --> 02:12:28,530
Um,

4639
02:12:28,530 --> 02:12:31,440
in a world where the media
is not doing its job.

4640
02:12:31,770 --> 02:12:33,440
You do need to wikileaks and that.

4641
02:12:33,441 --> 02:12:34,141
That's what's sad.

4642
02:12:34,141 --> 02:12:37,560
I'd rather you could have a wiki leaks
that didn't give out information that

4643
02:12:37,561 --> 02:12:38,640
none of us wants given out,

4644
02:12:38,970 --> 02:12:40,200
but you get the good with the bad.

4645
02:12:40,300 --> 02:12:45,300
I don't think anybody could have done
that job except that one guy who got ahold

4646
02:12:45,880 --> 02:12:46,691
of that information.

4647
02:12:46,691 --> 02:12:47,650
I don't think it's a matter of,

4648
02:12:47,730 --> 02:12:51,360
you don't think that it was inevitable
at some point that some group of either

4649
02:12:51,361 --> 02:12:52,620
hackers or,

4650
02:12:52,830 --> 02:12:53,281
or you know,

4651
02:12:53,281 --> 02:12:54,114
I mean that's,

4652
02:12:54,150 --> 02:12:54,601
I don't know.

4653
02:12:54,601 --> 02:12:55,240
I think

4654
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:56,660
it was an inevitability maybe,

4655
02:12:56,700 --> 02:12:58,120
but I mean to do it illegally.

4656
02:12:58,150 --> 02:12:58,811
I mean when you're,

4657
02:12:58,811 --> 02:13:01,900
when you're talking about the
journalism journalists doing their job,

4658
02:13:02,290 --> 02:13:06,810
if what really been interesting is if
Bradley Manning had gotten those documents

4659
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:07,720
in New York Times,

4660
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:09,310
I wonder how they would have handled it.

4661
02:13:09,490 --> 02:13:10,540
What would they have done?

4662
02:13:10,541 --> 02:13:12,340
What wikileaks did and if they did,

4663
02:13:12,341 --> 02:13:13,900
would they be considered criminals?

4664
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:15,920
Like he like Julian Assange,

4665
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:16,320
you

4666
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:19,440
say that because I just had a listener
download an article for me about five

4667
02:13:19,441 --> 02:13:20,700
weeks ago cause I heard about it.

4668
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:24,960
It was in the wake of the
whole Watergate thing.

4669
02:13:25,470 --> 02:13:25,801
The,

4670
02:13:25,801 --> 02:13:26,250
the,

4671
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:30,450
the head of the Washington Post gave a
speech to all these big corporate muckety

4672
02:13:30,451 --> 02:13:32,370
mucks a couple years after that.

4673
02:13:32,490 --> 02:13:33,780
Trying to explain that,

4674
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:35,160
that don't worry,

4675
02:13:35,370 --> 02:13:39,120
we're not going to get all expos a now
this isn't gonna this isn't going to be a

4676
02:13:39,121 --> 02:13:41,370
trend of ours to bring down
presidents and everything.

4677
02:13:41,371 --> 02:13:43,880
You don't have to worry and
you can go actually down,

4678
02:13:43,910 --> 02:13:44,070
you know,

4679
02:13:44,070 --> 02:13:46,890
if you have a j store account or
whatever with these libraries,

4680
02:13:46,891 --> 02:13:51,270
you can actually download the speech
from like 1976 and it was a Katharine

4681
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:51,271
Graham,

4682
02:13:51,271 --> 02:13:54,270
the head of the Washington Post where it
was this reassuring thing to the powers

4683
02:13:54,271 --> 02:13:55,650
that be that don't worry,

4684
02:13:55,651 --> 02:13:58,710
the media is not going to
get to investigative and
we're going to make sure we

4685
02:13:58,711 --> 02:14:00,630
protect your secrets enough
so you don't have to worry.

4686
02:14:00,990 --> 02:14:04,290
That's what wikileaks and
groups like it don't do.

4687
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,290
And the truth is,

4688
02:14:06,291 --> 02:14:09,300
is I think we can all agree that there
are secrets that should not come out.

4689
02:14:09,780 --> 02:14:10,170
Um,

4690
02:14:10,170 --> 02:14:12,690
the government abuses this
privilege over and over again,

4691
02:14:12,691 --> 02:14:15,630
but if it's really going to kill
us service members for example.

4692
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:16,020
Right,

4693
02:14:16,020 --> 02:14:16,710
okay,

4694
02:14:16,710 --> 02:14:17,610
I understand that.

4695
02:14:17,730 --> 02:14:20,370
But when you say anything's
going to kill us service members,

4696
02:14:20,371 --> 02:14:21,021
so I mean that,

4697
02:14:21,021 --> 02:14:21,900
that when you abuse it,

4698
02:14:21,901 --> 02:14:22,320
you stop,

4699
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:23,153
you lose me.

4700
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:23,700
Um,

4701
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:23,971
if the,

4702
02:14:23,971 --> 02:14:26,040
if the media and the government
were doing their job,

4703
02:14:26,041 --> 02:14:28,410
you don't need a wiki
leaks when they're not.

4704
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:32,650
Is it better to have no wikileaks at
all or is it better to have a wikileaks

4705
02:14:32,730 --> 02:14:33,780
with all its flaws?

4706
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:35,400
I'm sorry if the government,

4707
02:14:35,490 --> 02:14:40,490
if the stuff that we're already finding
out opens up such a window of importance

4708
02:14:40,651 --> 02:14:44,280
in terms of us understanding how the
world really works behind the scenes.

4709
02:14:44,670 --> 02:14:45,211
I'm sorry,

4710
02:14:45,211 --> 02:14:47,370
to me that's pretty darn invaluable.

4711
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:47,881
But you know,

4712
02:14:47,881 --> 02:14:48,131
I'm,

4713
02:14:48,131 --> 02:14:48,970
I'm biased as,

4714
02:14:48,971 --> 02:14:49,830
as a journalistic guy.

4715
02:14:49,831 --> 02:14:51,450
I believe in that kind of openness.

4716
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:52,080
Yeah,

4717
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:52,801
most certainly.

4718
02:14:52,801 --> 02:14:53,041
And I,

4719
02:14:53,041 --> 02:14:53,671
and I do too.

4720
02:14:53,671 --> 02:14:55,730
And I believe in it also
for the people that are in,

4721
02:14:55,731 --> 02:14:56,011
in,

4722
02:14:56,011 --> 02:14:56,960
in power.

4723
02:14:57,480 --> 02:14:58,800
But a lot of my listeners don't,

4724
02:14:58,801 --> 02:14:59,311
I got to tell you,

4725
02:14:59,311 --> 02:15:00,780
a lot of them are conditioned,

4726
02:15:00,781 --> 02:15:02,430
I think conditioned to think that that's,

4727
02:15:02,610 --> 02:15:02,821
you know,

4728
02:15:02,821 --> 02:15:04,920
you're going to release important
secrets and get people killed.

4729
02:15:04,921 --> 02:15:08,340
And I got a lot of flack when I said that
I was in favor of wikileaks releasing

4730
02:15:08,341 --> 02:15:09,174
some of this stuff.

4731
02:15:09,410 --> 02:15:11,150
You can correct me if I'm wrong,

4732
02:15:11,180 --> 02:15:11,510
uh,

4733
02:15:11,510 --> 02:15:12,231
online people,

4734
02:15:12,231 --> 02:15:15,200
but I don't believe they released
any names of anyone that,

4735
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:17,300
who security hadn't
already been compromised.

4736
02:15:17,370 --> 02:15:17,521
Well,

4737
02:15:17,521 --> 02:15:18,151
and to be honest,

4738
02:15:18,151 --> 02:15:18,781
we may not know,

4739
02:15:18,781 --> 02:15:19,770
but has the,

4740
02:15:19,830 --> 02:15:22,170
has the world falling
apart since they did?

4741
02:15:22,171 --> 02:15:22,471
I mean,

4742
02:15:22,471 --> 02:15:22,831
I think,

4743
02:15:22,831 --> 02:15:25,140
I think we can see here it has
an exactly destroyed everything.

4744
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:30,200
We got to look into the mentality of
the people that are in the military in

4745
02:15:31,021 --> 02:15:32,550
crisis situations like that.

4746
02:15:32,551 --> 02:15:33,930
A collateral murder video.

4747
02:15:34,110 --> 02:15:34,261
Well,

4748
02:15:34,261 --> 02:15:35,130
it's bigger than that minister,

4749
02:15:35,150 --> 02:15:36,800
diplomatic stuff going and,

4750
02:15:36,820 --> 02:15:37,580
and I mean,

4751
02:15:37,580 --> 02:15:37,980
come on.

4752
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:39,300
The truth of the matter is is,

4753
02:15:39,570 --> 02:15:41,700
is you can only form a,

4754
02:15:41,701 --> 02:15:41,881
you know,

4755
02:15:41,881 --> 02:15:42,150
when you,

4756
02:15:42,150 --> 02:15:42,380
when you,

4757
02:15:42,380 --> 02:15:43,560
when you analyze news,

4758
02:15:43,561 --> 02:15:43,711
right?

4759
02:15:43,711 --> 02:15:44,011
You said,

4760
02:15:44,011 --> 02:15:44,791
Dan Carlin's during this,

4761
02:15:44,791 --> 02:15:45,624
the young Turks are doing it.

4762
02:15:45,630 --> 02:15:47,130
We're doing news analysis.

4763
02:15:47,310 --> 02:15:51,450
But that requires you to have
enough facts to really analyze.

4764
02:15:51,451 --> 02:15:52,141
If you don't,

4765
02:15:52,141 --> 02:15:55,140
you can't give it an analysis
that has any sort of value at all.

4766
02:15:55,200 --> 02:15:59,130
And wikileaks was providing context
that the media used to provide.

4767
02:15:59,480 --> 02:15:59,841
Well,

4768
02:15:59,841 --> 02:15:59,921
I,

4769
02:15:59,921 --> 02:16:00,681
I think in,

4770
02:16:00,681 --> 02:16:00,981
in the,

4771
02:16:00,981 --> 02:16:02,000
in their situation,

4772
02:16:02,001 --> 02:16:02,960
I think their,

4773
02:16:02,990 --> 02:16:07,250
their position was so extreme
having this secret files,

4774
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:10,240
having this access to this one
guy and having secret files down.

4775
02:16:10,370 --> 02:16:14,480
I don't know how the media could have
gotten that in any other way unless it's

4776
02:16:14,481 --> 02:16:17,450
Bradley manning guy or someone
like him offered that stuff.

4777
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:18,630
That's how it would have been the,

4778
02:16:18,631 --> 02:16:19,560
and that's how it used to be.

4779
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:20,930
What would happen is that we'll,

4780
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:23,370
how did it happen for a
Woodward and Bernstein?

4781
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:26,070
You had a guy who was in the CIA,

4782
02:16:26,071 --> 02:16:27,300
one of the top people,

4783
02:16:27,301 --> 02:16:28,380
feet deep throat.

4784
02:16:28,410 --> 02:16:29,243
Who was that?

4785
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:30,720
Oh God,

4786
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:31,990
he died just a few years ago.

4787
02:16:31,991 --> 02:16:32,590
What they know.

4788
02:16:32,590 --> 02:16:33,101
Yeah.

4789
02:16:33,101 --> 02:16:34,000
They know who he is now.

4790
02:16:34,001 --> 02:16:37,040
And he was disgruntled and mad at being a,

4791
02:16:37,060 --> 02:16:41,050
not getting a promotion and all this and
so he was feeding them this stuff that

4792
02:16:41,051 --> 02:16:42,340
he wasn't allowed to feed them.

4793
02:16:42,341 --> 02:16:42,851
And it's like,

4794
02:16:42,851 --> 02:16:44,320
it's like I'm the guy who,

4795
02:16:44,330 --> 02:16:44,710
uh,

4796
02:16:44,710 --> 02:16:46,780
Daniel Ellsberg who was
involved in that whole thing,

4797
02:16:46,781 --> 02:16:47,680
the Pentagon papers.

4798
02:16:47,890 --> 02:16:50,320
He says today that Julian Assange is,

4799
02:16:50,350 --> 02:16:55,180
is the modern day version of him and
that he could have been brought up on the

4800
02:16:55,181 --> 02:16:56,830
exact same charge as an almost was,

4801
02:16:57,010 --> 02:16:57,251
I mean,

4802
02:16:57,251 --> 02:17:02,251
to bring up the 1917 espionage act as a
way to go after somebody in the modern

4803
02:17:03,521 --> 02:17:07,740
21st century world is to me an example
of how desperate they are mean.

4804
02:17:07,810 --> 02:17:09,070
Here's all you have to know.

4805
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:12,940
This isn't really about this or
that individual losing their lives.

4806
02:17:13,150 --> 02:17:16,960
This is about how much scandal you would
have if we really knew what was going

4807
02:17:16,961 --> 02:17:20,640
on behind the scenes and what
are politicians gave the okay for

4808
02:17:23,490 --> 02:17:25,170
in the same way that Watergate was.

4809
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:26,050
Yeah,

4810
02:17:26,050 --> 02:17:26,883
it's um,

4811
02:17:27,130 --> 02:17:29,440
it's so strange to me
watching him in the embassy,

4812
02:17:29,850 --> 02:17:34,850
was he the Guatemalan embassy and just
hang out on a balcony giving speeches.

4813
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:36,940
You said Ross Perot.

4814
02:17:36,941 --> 02:17:37,201
I mean,

4815
02:17:37,201 --> 02:17:37,500
I'm not

4816
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:37,681
sure.

4817
02:17:37,681 --> 02:17:40,530
Part of the problem here is that
this guy is such a weirdo anyway.

4818
02:17:40,531 --> 02:17:41,160
I mean,

4819
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:44,520
if you'd had the all American boy
that it would be a lot harder.

4820
02:17:44,521 --> 02:17:46,020
You'd still find weirder stories.

4821
02:17:46,021 --> 02:17:49,410
But why is it always one of
these guys where it's so easy?

4822
02:17:49,470 --> 02:17:49,681
Yeah,

4823
02:17:49,681 --> 02:17:50,041
so you know,

4824
02:17:50,041 --> 02:17:50,520
why do that?

4825
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:52,260
Why does he have to help so much?

4826
02:17:52,261 --> 02:17:52,621
You know?

4827
02:17:52,621 --> 02:17:54,210
Have you ever seen the
video of him dancing?

4828
02:17:54,330 --> 02:17:54,931
No.

4829
02:17:54,931 --> 02:17:55,890
I can only imagine.

4830
02:17:55,891 --> 02:17:56,521
You must see it.

4831
02:17:56,521 --> 02:17:57,210
Pull it up.

4832
02:17:57,210 --> 02:17:57,860
Pull it up.

4833
02:17:57,860 --> 02:17:58,510
We can do that though.

4834
02:17:58,510 --> 02:18:01,350
The marvels of 21st of this
studio has capabilities.

4835
02:18:01,351 --> 02:18:02,240
Mind doesn't have it.

4836
02:18:02,241 --> 02:18:02,970
Just want you to know.

4837
02:18:02,970 --> 02:18:03,500
Yeah,

4838
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:04,333
we have youtube.

4839
02:18:04,350 --> 02:18:04,940
I'm looking at,

4840
02:18:04,940 --> 02:18:05,551
you can see me right now.

4841
02:18:05,551 --> 02:18:08,010
I'm looking up at Edmond
Joe's wonderful monitor here.

4842
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:12,000
Julian assigns dancing is one of the
silliest things you've ever seen in your

4843
02:18:12,001 --> 02:18:13,710
life because did it get leaked?

4844
02:18:13,711 --> 02:18:14,730
Is that how we know about it?

4845
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:17,590
It must've a rival anonymous from gets.

4846
02:18:17,740 --> 02:18:20,120
What about someone who wanted
to put a stop to this nonsense?

4847
02:18:20,121 --> 02:18:20,320
Right?

4848
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:20,421
Cool.

4849
02:18:20,421 --> 02:18:21,940
You're following this movement.

4850
02:18:22,210 --> 02:18:23,100
This is your hero.

4851
02:18:23,250 --> 02:18:23,520
Well,

4852
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:25,740
that's a funny thing because
we will judge you by the way.

4853
02:18:25,741 --> 02:18:26,850
You move your body to music,

4854
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:29,280
which is why I won't do that on video.

4855
02:18:29,310 --> 02:18:29,720
Really?

4856
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:30,210
That's why.

4857
02:18:30,210 --> 02:18:31,230
Because you want to be respected.

4858
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:31,650
I know.

4859
02:18:31,650 --> 02:18:32,730
I don't want to be embarrassed.

4860
02:18:32,731 --> 02:18:33,270
There's any difference.

4861
02:18:33,270 --> 02:18:37,440
I am willing to dance at every possible
opportunity to keep me from ever having

4862
02:18:37,441 --> 02:18:38,670
to be in any sort of a political

4863
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:39,240
position.

4864
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:39,600
Let's see.

4865
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:40,433
Look at this.

4866
02:18:40,530 --> 02:18:41,363
First of all.

4867
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:42,350
Okay.

4868
02:18:42,350 --> 02:18:44,960
How much ecstasy do you have to be on
before you want to dance like that?

4869
02:18:44,961 --> 02:18:45,794
Did we lose it?

4870
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:47,240
Is this,

4871
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:49,160
we have the shittiest
fucking Internet here.

4872
02:18:49,330 --> 02:18:51,340
It's getting fixed by
the end of this month.

4873
02:18:53,110 --> 02:18:53,830
We're almost,

4874
02:18:53,830 --> 02:18:54,401
when is this?

4875
02:18:54,401 --> 02:18:56,120
Does anybody know where this is taken?

4876
02:18:56,121 --> 02:18:58,270
It doesn't matter if this
was taken in a past life.

4877
02:18:58,660 --> 02:19:00,910
He's guilty and he's all by himself.

4878
02:19:00,911 --> 02:19:01,250
He's like,

4879
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:01,720
yeah.

4880
02:19:01,720 --> 02:19:02,680
Oh my gosh.

4881
02:19:02,770 --> 02:19:04,060
Look at him by himself.

4882
02:19:04,210 --> 02:19:06,370
Imagine Ross Perot dancing like that.

4883
02:19:06,371 --> 02:19:07,930
He'd never be President Clinton.

4884
02:19:08,220 --> 02:19:08,600
Well,

4885
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:09,433
Clinton's done that.

4886
02:19:09,490 --> 02:19:10,060
Yeah,

4887
02:19:10,060 --> 02:19:11,260
the club was a lot darker.

4888
02:19:11,350 --> 02:19:13,780
This is what the Clinton do
before he shot his third load.

4889
02:19:14,110 --> 02:19:16,110
It goes out there to
get a little exercise.

4890
02:19:16,660 --> 02:19:17,111
I've just,

4891
02:19:17,111 --> 02:19:17,944
I'm sorry this,

4892
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:19,330
this is part of the problem though.

4893
02:19:19,331 --> 02:19:19,571
I mean,

4894
02:19:19,571 --> 02:19:21,350
you know Julian Assange Lens Lens.

4895
02:19:21,830 --> 02:19:22,061
What?

4896
02:19:22,061 --> 02:19:22,640
Look at it this way.

4897
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:23,473
I would say,

4898
02:19:25,250 --> 02:19:25,460
yeah,

4899
02:19:25,460 --> 02:19:26,293
that is pretty funny.

4900
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:28,070
It's not quite

4901
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:28,701
gay.

4902
02:19:28,701 --> 02:19:30,380
It's not quite feminine.

4903
02:19:30,410 --> 02:19:31,790
It's not masculine.

4904
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:32,653
Pretty damn good.

4905
02:19:32,870 --> 02:19:33,703
You like it.

4906
02:19:34,290 --> 02:19:35,120
Are you happy with it?

4907
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:35,511
Yeah.

4908
02:19:35,511 --> 02:19:39,190
He's one of those crazy guys at the
bar that dances by himself goes,

4909
02:19:39,510 --> 02:19:40,580
you don't take those guys home.

4910
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:45,740
Who's taking those guys home
and some poor girl rocks?

4911
02:19:46,310 --> 02:19:46,490
He,

4912
02:19:46,490 --> 02:19:47,930
his situation is hilarious.

4913
02:19:47,931 --> 02:19:50,480
If you know the story with
what they're charging him with,

4914
02:19:50,630 --> 02:19:51,680
when everybody sees like,

4915
02:19:51,710 --> 02:19:51,891
oh,

4916
02:19:51,891 --> 02:19:52,700
Julian Assange,

4917
02:19:52,700 --> 02:19:53,061
you say,

4918
02:19:53,061 --> 02:19:53,331
well,

4919
02:19:53,331 --> 02:19:55,130
he must have been guilty of espionage.

4920
02:19:55,131 --> 02:19:56,840
She must've been guilty
of leaking secrets.

4921
02:19:56,841 --> 02:19:58,040
He must be guilty of something bad.

4922
02:19:58,730 --> 02:19:59,900
That's not why they're after him.

4923
02:20:00,110 --> 02:20:00,943
Thereafter,

4924
02:20:00,990 --> 02:20:03,890
they're after him because
he had sex with a woman.

4925
02:20:04,070 --> 02:20:05,450
Surprise sex,

4926
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:06,920
and this is what folks don't understand.

4927
02:20:07,010 --> 02:20:10,430
The actual charges they've trumped
up against Julian Assange are,

4928
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:11,970
he had had sex with him,

4929
02:20:11,971 --> 02:20:12,651
one with the condom.

4930
02:20:12,651 --> 02:20:13,700
They were lying in bed naked.

4931
02:20:13,701 --> 02:20:15,020
He stuck it in without a condom.

4932
02:20:15,420 --> 02:20:15,760
Yeah.

4933
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:15,890
The,

4934
02:20:15,890 --> 02:20:16,221
here's the,

4935
02:20:16,221 --> 02:20:16,911
here's the key.

4936
02:20:16,911 --> 02:20:17,210
He's,

4937
02:20:17,210 --> 02:20:17,871
he's sending,

4938
02:20:17,871 --> 02:20:18,651
his lawyers have said,

4939
02:20:18,651 --> 02:20:19,580
as I understand it,

4940
02:20:19,910 --> 02:20:22,700
that as long as he gets a written
pledge from our government,

4941
02:20:22,701 --> 02:20:23,534
the British government,

4942
02:20:23,630 --> 02:20:24,860
that they're not going to nab him.

4943
02:20:24,861 --> 02:20:26,300
He'll go back and face the charges.

4944
02:20:26,570 --> 02:20:27,201
The key is,

4945
02:20:27,201 --> 02:20:30,770
is everybody knows that those are
the governments that wanted it.

4946
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:33,620
The danger isn't that he's going to
go to Sweden and face these charges.

4947
02:20:33,621 --> 02:20:36,620
The danger is that somebody
is going to disappear him.

4948
02:20:36,621 --> 02:20:37,131
That's right.

4949
02:20:37,131 --> 02:20:40,400
And he's given a dissident and the
government would like to do that to set an

4950
02:20:40,401 --> 02:20:41,234
example.

4951
02:20:41,510 --> 02:20:42,141
The problem is,

4952
02:20:42,141 --> 02:20:42,501
is one,

4953
02:20:42,501 --> 02:20:43,680
he's not an American citizen.

4954
02:20:43,681 --> 02:20:43,940
So what?

4955
02:20:43,940 --> 02:20:45,800
You can't charge him with the same things.

4956
02:20:45,801 --> 02:20:47,120
You could charge a Bradley Manning.

4957
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:48,350
Would he become,

4958
02:20:48,410 --> 02:20:51,230
do you think you'd become a martyr
if something like that happened?

4959
02:20:51,231 --> 02:20:52,160
Don't you think there's a danger?

4960
02:20:52,230 --> 02:20:53,660
You're already getting some of that?

4961
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:53,960
Um,

4962
02:20:53,960 --> 02:20:54,380
yeah,

4963
02:20:54,380 --> 02:20:55,000
for sure.

4964
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:55,530
I don't,

4965
02:20:55,530 --> 02:20:56,000
you know what?

4966
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,010
I don't think the government
cares too much about that.

4967
02:20:58,011 --> 02:21:01,760
I think their attitude is they want you
to see what happens to somebody who does

4968
02:21:01,761 --> 02:21:04,220
what Julian Assange does so that you know,

4969
02:21:04,221 --> 02:21:04,910
if you do it.

4970
02:21:04,910 --> 02:21:05,480
I think the,

4971
02:21:05,480 --> 02:21:06,590
who was the guy who just died?

4972
02:21:06,591 --> 02:21:07,520
He just killed himself.

4973
02:21:07,730 --> 02:21:09,270
That the government was
after for stealing files.

4974
02:21:09,290 --> 02:21:10,041
Aaron,

4975
02:21:10,041 --> 02:21:11,000
what was his last name?

4976
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:14,540
The guy who killed himself was under
pressure from the governor for stealing

4977
02:21:14,541 --> 02:21:15,560
some stuff from MIT,

4978
02:21:15,561 --> 02:21:16,490
some digital files.

4979
02:21:16,491 --> 02:21:17,390
I'm not aware of this guy.

4980
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:17,780
Oh,

4981
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:18,111
come on.

4982
02:21:18,111 --> 02:21:18,381
This is,

4983
02:21:18,381 --> 02:21:19,191
this is a big story.

4984
02:21:19,191 --> 02:21:20,090
The guy killed himself,

4985
02:21:20,091 --> 02:21:23,660
a big computer guy who helped
create a child himself.

4986
02:21:23,661 --> 02:21:24,170
Aaron,

4987
02:21:24,170 --> 02:21:24,860
Aaron.

4988
02:21:24,860 --> 02:21:25,251
Oh,

4989
02:21:25,251 --> 02:21:25,920
I know who you're talking,

4990
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:26,241
I'm sorry.

4991
02:21:26,241 --> 02:21:27,390
How can I forget his last time?

4992
02:21:27,880 --> 02:21:31,760
I'm going to ask the guy who was the
responsible for the creation of RSS feeds.

4993
02:21:31,790 --> 02:21:32,120
Yes,

4994
02:21:32,120 --> 02:21:32,481
exactly.

4995
02:21:32,481 --> 02:21:32,690
Yeah,

4996
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:33,340
Aaron Schwartz.

4997
02:21:33,340 --> 02:21:33,651
Yes,

4998
02:21:33,651 --> 02:21:34,131
exactly.

4999
02:21:34,131 --> 02:21:34,791
I should have known that.

5000
02:21:34,791 --> 02:21:34,961
And,

5001
02:21:34,961 --> 02:21:39,961
and but he's another example where the
government wants to break that guy as,

5002
02:21:40,791 --> 02:21:43,010
as to set a precedent so that you know,

5003
02:21:43,011 --> 02:21:44,600
when you want to try to
do something like that,

5004
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:47,180
you're sacrificing your life in effect,

5005
02:21:47,230 --> 02:21:47,920
in effect.

5006
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:48,330
You know,

5007
02:21:48,330 --> 02:21:49,250
you can do this,

5008
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:51,380
but look at what happened
at the last guy who did it.

5009
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:52,041
And that's,

5010
02:21:52,041 --> 02:21:52,874
I think what they want to do too,

5011
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:53,541
with signage to,

5012
02:21:53,541 --> 02:21:54,980
to say to all those hackers out there,

5013
02:21:55,130 --> 02:21:55,460
hey,

5014
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:55,700
you know,

5015
02:21:55,700 --> 02:21:56,271
just so you know,

5016
02:21:56,271 --> 02:21:57,140
you're playing with your future.

5017
02:21:57,141 --> 02:21:59,270
They've done this at the so
called ecoterrorists too,

5018
02:21:59,271 --> 02:22:02,120
where they'll give you 35
years or something for,

5019
02:22:02,121 --> 02:22:05,260
for starting a fire where you
can kill a guy and get out in 12.

5020
02:22:05,270 --> 02:22:07,340
And could they put you on no fly list?

5021
02:22:07,370 --> 02:22:07,700
Yeah,

5022
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:08,390
you're done.

5023
02:22:08,390 --> 02:22:10,880
They'd do everything they can
to sort of stifle your life.

5024
02:22:11,390 --> 02:22:12,110
And um,

5025
02:22:12,110 --> 02:22:13,880
the fact that we accept that though,

5026
02:22:13,881 --> 02:22:14,960
the fact that this,

5027
02:22:14,961 --> 02:22:19,961
this guy does not have the same access
to a representation to rights that,

5028
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:23,090
that we do that he's
not an American start.

5029
02:22:23,091 --> 02:22:23,901
Start with that though.

5030
02:22:23,901 --> 02:22:24,171
I mean,

5031
02:22:24,171 --> 02:22:24,560
yeah.

5032
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:25,030
Uh,

5033
02:22:25,030 --> 02:22:26,160
and not that an American

5034
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:28,560
would either if you were
accused of a crime of terrorism,

5035
02:22:28,561 --> 02:22:29,130
I mean,

5036
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:29,431
if you're,

5037
02:22:29,431 --> 02:22:31,950
if you're accused of a crime of
terrorism and you're in a place like

5038
02:22:31,951 --> 02:22:32,820
Afghanistan,

5039
02:22:33,030 --> 02:22:34,080
you have no rights at all.

5040
02:22:34,081 --> 02:22:36,900
If a guy in the executive
branch of government decides,

5041
02:22:37,130 --> 02:22:37,281
well,

5042
02:22:37,281 --> 02:22:39,620
what a creepy sweeping term terrorism is,

5043
02:22:39,621 --> 02:22:42,170
if it applies to you exposing murder.

5044
02:22:42,500 --> 02:22:44,350
And just so exposing the,

5045
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:48,730
whether it's an aptitude or
just a casual disdain or,

5046
02:22:48,731 --> 02:22:48,940
or,

5047
02:22:48,940 --> 02:22:49,131
or,

5048
02:22:49,131 --> 02:22:50,330
or just,

5049
02:22:50,370 --> 02:22:51,150
uh,

5050
02:22:51,150 --> 02:22:51,510
uh,

5051
02:22:51,510 --> 02:22:53,660
a lack of respect for human life.

5052
02:22:53,800 --> 02:22:56,200
And here's the thing you want to get
into history and where history is

5053
02:22:56,201 --> 02:22:57,034
important.

5054
02:22:57,190 --> 02:22:58,240
Every time,

5055
02:22:58,380 --> 02:22:59,440
every is a sweeping word,

5056
02:22:59,441 --> 02:22:59,921
but many,

5057
02:22:59,921 --> 02:23:03,460
many times throughout history when
someone wants to exempt people from the

5058
02:23:03,461 --> 02:23:04,630
normal rules of conduct,

5059
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:06,340
you call them terrorists.

5060
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:07,181
It's a term,

5061
02:23:07,181 --> 02:23:07,901
believe it or not,

5062
02:23:07,901 --> 02:23:12,310
Adolph Hitler used it when he was
explaining why you didn't have to treat

5063
02:23:12,311 --> 02:23:16,270
captured prisoners in the Soviet Union
with any sort of the laws of war.

5064
02:23:16,390 --> 02:23:17,320
They're terrorists,

5065
02:23:17,530 --> 02:23:18,363
Jews,

5066
02:23:18,430 --> 02:23:23,430
commissar has anyone found behind the
front lines is a terrorist which exempts

5067
02:23:23,561 --> 02:23:25,360
you from treating them
like prisoners of war.

5068
02:23:25,620 --> 02:23:26,200
I mean,

5069
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:29,980
terrorist is a word that means
anything you want it to mean.

5070
02:23:30,010 --> 02:23:32,140
And it's been proven to
be that over and over.

5071
02:23:32,230 --> 02:23:32,681
Not that,

5072
02:23:32,681 --> 02:23:34,540
not that there aren't real terrorists,

5073
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:38,900
but the term is so remarkably flexible
and allows you to essentially how,

5074
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:41,950
who can you waterboard you could only
waterboard terrorist who's a terrorist.

5075
02:23:42,610 --> 02:23:43,690
That's to be determined.

5076
02:23:43,810 --> 02:23:45,670
We don't know who
tomorrow's terrorists are.

5077
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:46,900
We'll tell you when we get there.

5078
02:23:47,010 --> 02:23:47,161
Well,

5079
02:23:47,161 --> 02:23:50,760
terrorists are also defined
as people sell drugs.

5080
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:51,511
They've,

5081
02:23:51,511 --> 02:23:52,050
um,

5082
02:23:52,050 --> 02:23:55,830
because of all these different things
that they passed the Patriot Act,

5083
02:23:55,831 --> 02:23:57,510
the Patriot Act to the NDA.

5084
02:23:57,540 --> 02:23:57,751
Well,

5085
02:23:57,751 --> 02:24:01,830
one of the things that they've done in
these sort of sweeping definitions as

5086
02:24:01,831 --> 02:24:02,340
they've,

5087
02:24:02,340 --> 02:24:02,780
uh,

5088
02:24:02,780 --> 02:24:07,380
they've allowed the government to use
things that were supposed to be there to

5089
02:24:07,381 --> 02:24:10,560
protect you from terrorism or to
enforce laws against terrorism.

5090
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:12,030
And now they use it for drugs.

5091
02:24:12,031 --> 02:24:12,781
Like for instance,

5092
02:24:12,781 --> 02:24:13,590
the Patriot Act,

5093
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:18,590
the Patriot Act has been used rough
more than a thousand times for drugs.

5094
02:24:18,930 --> 02:24:19,260
This is,

5095
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:20,550
this goes way back though.

5096
02:24:20,551 --> 02:24:20,910
It's,

5097
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:25,890
it's the old American Canard of the
targeted extra extraordinary law.

5098
02:24:26,100 --> 02:24:27,930
Start with Rico.

5099
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:29,880
Most people have heard of the Rico Act.

5100
02:24:29,881 --> 02:24:32,700
We use the Rico act against
everybody in their brother today,

5101
02:24:32,701 --> 02:24:33,300
right?

5102
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:36,120
The Rico Act is an extra
constitutional law.

5103
02:24:36,330 --> 02:24:39,990
It was extra constitutional because when
we passed it in the early seventies,

5104
02:24:40,230 --> 02:24:43,560
we needed to go after the
mafia organized crime.

5105
02:24:43,561 --> 02:24:46,920
And the way this thing was sold is that
organized crime because of their power,

5106
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:50,370
was resistant to normal
rules and approaches.

5107
02:24:50,490 --> 02:24:55,380
So you had to have special laws and
it will only be used against organized

5108
02:24:55,381 --> 02:24:55,681
crime.

5109
02:24:55,681 --> 02:24:56,191
And the Mafia.

5110
02:24:56,191 --> 02:24:57,001
He was really the Mafia.

5111
02:24:57,001 --> 02:24:58,080
We called it organized crime,

5112
02:24:58,081 --> 02:25:01,500
but it was the mafia and because they
were so specially powerful and so

5113
02:25:01,501 --> 02:25:02,071
insulated,

5114
02:25:02,071 --> 02:25:03,300
you couldn't get the top guys.

5115
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:06,990
We were going to have a special law that
just applied to them and just like all

5116
02:25:06,991 --> 02:25:11,310
these other special laws
eventually becomes too nice
and easy of a tool to start

5117
02:25:11,311 --> 02:25:12,480
applying it to other things.

5118
02:25:12,630 --> 02:25:16,020
We use Rico against two people
in a room making a drug deal.

5119
02:25:16,021 --> 02:25:18,620
Now all but this is a long history.

5120
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:23,080
Anytime they pass a special law that's
extra constitutional because of the

5121
02:25:23,081 --> 02:25:24,220
extremity of the threat,

5122
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:26,680
it always gets brought
down to lower level.

5123
02:25:26,870 --> 02:25:27,940
When people don't understand,

5124
02:25:27,941 --> 02:25:29,320
if you hear about the Patriot Act,

5125
02:25:29,321 --> 02:25:29,531
go,

5126
02:25:29,531 --> 02:25:30,720
well guess that's a,

5127
02:25:30,721 --> 02:25:34,690
so they can stop people from
plotting crimes against America.

5128
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:39,180
The Patriot Act is used way
more for marijuana than it
ever has been for Teleco.

5129
02:25:39,190 --> 02:25:40,330
Wrote about this in his book too.

5130
02:25:40,670 --> 02:25:42,470
In 2011 the,

5131
02:25:42,471 --> 02:25:42,800
the,

5132
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:46,750
the numbers were 1,618 drug cases,

5133
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:49,090
15 terrorism cases.

5134
02:25:49,390 --> 02:25:49,740
Well,

5135
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:49,960
you know,

5136
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:51,460
there just isn't that much terrorism.

5137
02:25:51,490 --> 02:25:56,490
I mean it's a waste of a good law and
that is a problem with having laws and

5138
02:25:57,221 --> 02:25:59,950
then removing laws that people have
to be aware of when they talk about,

5139
02:25:59,951 --> 02:26:00,191
well,

5140
02:26:00,191 --> 02:26:00,341
hey,

5141
02:26:00,341 --> 02:26:01,840
they should just make drugs legal.

5142
02:26:02,050 --> 02:26:03,850
What are you going to do
with all his DEA agents?

5143
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:05,730
Were you going to do with those
people that don't have jobs?

5144
02:26:06,020 --> 02:26:06,853
Back to the media thing,

5145
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:09,440
how does the president not have
to answer a question about that?

5146
02:26:09,441 --> 02:26:09,890
It's true.

5147
02:26:09,890 --> 02:26:10,630
How do you,

5148
02:26:10,630 --> 02:26:11,050
the the,

5149
02:26:11,050 --> 02:26:15,830
the fact that this all goes on confounds
us because nobody ever has to comment

5150
02:26:15,831 --> 02:26:16,011
on it.

5151
02:26:16,011 --> 02:26:17,960
The job of the journalist
is say to the president,

5152
02:26:18,590 --> 02:26:21,230
16,000 [inaudible] say
exactly what you said and say,

5153
02:26:21,231 --> 02:26:24,410
what's your opinion of that and
what are you going to do about it?

5154
02:26:24,690 --> 02:26:25,880
[inaudible] I mean,

5155
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:26,511
you know,

5156
02:26:26,511 --> 02:26:30,470
you watch the British parliament in
action sometimes on cspan and every time I

5157
02:26:30,471 --> 02:26:30,981
mentioned this,

5158
02:26:30,981 --> 02:26:31,520
the British,

5159
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:31,761
you know,

5160
02:26:31,761 --> 02:26:32,930
podcasting is wonderful,

5161
02:26:32,931 --> 02:26:33,171
isn't it?

5162
02:26:33,171 --> 02:26:34,070
You have an international audience.

5163
02:26:34,071 --> 02:26:34,731
The British shall we say,

5164
02:26:34,731 --> 02:26:36,020
don't romanticize it.

5165
02:26:36,140 --> 02:26:37,820
It sucks just as bad as your government,

5166
02:26:37,940 --> 02:26:40,550
but to an American when you
watch parliament than action.

5167
02:26:40,790 --> 02:26:42,080
And the head of the government,

5168
02:26:42,081 --> 02:26:44,510
the equivalent of our president has to
get up there and actually defend his

5169
02:26:44,511 --> 02:26:49,370
policies to the hooting and hollering and
borderline violence of the rest of the

5170
02:26:49,371 --> 02:26:50,270
people in parliament.

5171
02:26:51,020 --> 02:26:51,740
I'm done.

5172
02:26:51,740 --> 02:26:53,360
Forget about real reform.

5173
02:26:53,390 --> 02:26:56,540
I just want him to get up there and have
to face the questions and hear how they

5174
02:26:56,670 --> 02:26:57,440
wheeze allowed.

5175
02:26:57,440 --> 02:26:58,970
If you throw that question,

5176
02:26:59,030 --> 02:27:03,200
like if we'd had a real debate during
this last presidential campaign and you

5177
02:27:03,201 --> 02:27:05,960
ask Mitt Romney that
question and us Barack Obama,

5178
02:27:05,961 --> 02:27:06,794
that question,

5179
02:27:06,870 --> 02:27:07,940
and it was asked by the way,

5180
02:27:07,941 --> 02:27:11,900
if you saw the third party debate where
all of those interesting and sometimes

5181
02:27:11,901 --> 02:27:14,300
freaky people actually
talked about the issues,

5182
02:27:14,301 --> 02:27:15,200
they brought this up,

5183
02:27:15,440 --> 02:27:18,590
but Barack Obama and Mitt Romney didn't
have to talk about it because it wasn't

5184
02:27:18,591 --> 02:27:21,050
agreed to buy them in advance.

5185
02:27:21,470 --> 02:27:24,200
Get to that commission on presidential
debates thing where they agree on what

5186
02:27:24,201 --> 02:27:24,860
they're going to talk about.

5187
02:27:24,860 --> 02:27:27,650
They don't want to talk about this and
they never talk about this and they never

5188
02:27:27,651 --> 02:27:28,670
get asked this.

5189
02:27:28,970 --> 02:27:29,211
I mean,

5190
02:27:29,211 --> 02:27:32,510
how do you get away with two terms in
office and you never have to answer a

5191
02:27:32,511 --> 02:27:33,500
question on that at all.

5192
02:27:33,650 --> 02:27:35,120
The commission for presidential debates,

5193
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:36,210
for folks who don't know,

5194
02:27:36,270 --> 02:27:37,730
they probably own company as well.

5195
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:40,520
It's not for Democrats and four
Republicans sit on the board.

5196
02:27:42,130 --> 02:27:42,530
Um,

5197
02:27:42,530 --> 02:27:43,460
do you remember Jeff Gannon?

5198
02:27:43,970 --> 02:27:44,870
Why does the name ring a bell?

5199
02:27:45,030 --> 02:27:45,210
Yup.

5200
02:27:45,210 --> 02:27:49,200
Gannon was the guy who was an embedded
White House reporter during the Bush

5201
02:27:49,201 --> 02:27:50,034
administration.

5202
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:55,640
Any would lob these really softball
partisan questions at Bush like Mr

5203
02:27:56,071 --> 02:27:56,790
President,

5204
02:27:56,790 --> 02:28:01,790
when are the Democrats going
to wake up and come to reality?

5205
02:28:01,890 --> 02:28:03,920
Who did he work for here?

5206
02:28:03,990 --> 02:28:04,823
Here's where it gets crazy.

5207
02:28:04,860 --> 02:28:05,130
Uh,

5208
02:28:05,130 --> 02:28:05,963
I don't remember,

5209
02:28:06,090 --> 02:28:09,160
but what happened was people
started getting suspicious.

5210
02:28:09,161 --> 02:28:09,391
So like,

5211
02:28:09,391 --> 02:28:10,290
who the fuck is this guy?

5212
02:28:11,030 --> 02:28:13,020
He's coming back to me a little
going on with these questions.

5213
02:28:13,021 --> 02:28:14,220
These are ridiculous questions.

5214
02:28:14,221 --> 02:28:14,431
I mean,

5215
02:28:14,431 --> 02:28:17,280
these are over the top and obvious.

5216
02:28:17,281 --> 02:28:19,260
Even if plant no worse,

5217
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:24,250
he was a gay prostitute and he
was a man who ran a gig prostitute

5218
02:28:24,510 --> 02:28:24,900
site.

5219
02:28:24,900 --> 02:28:25,860
We did not see that coming.

5220
02:28:25,861 --> 02:28:26,850
By the way with him,

5221
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:31,740
he had dog tags on and a towel over his
genitals and he was like naked otherwise

5222
02:28:31,741 --> 02:28:34,250
and famously outed for this.

5223
02:28:34,290 --> 02:28:36,870
I just want to say I didn't know any
journalist you don't run back in my day.

5224
02:28:37,540 --> 02:28:38,790
Well I remember this story.

5225
02:28:38,820 --> 02:28:40,170
I remember the guys name.

5226
02:28:40,171 --> 02:28:41,040
But here's my question.

5227
02:28:41,070 --> 02:28:41,880
Um,

5228
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:45,510
what was the motive for
softball and the president?

5229
02:28:46,230 --> 02:28:47,650
The question Ken.

5230
02:28:47,670 --> 02:28:48,660
Ken Lay mostly.

5231
02:28:49,080 --> 02:28:49,913
Probably.

5232
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:51,600
Yeah.

5233
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:51,990
Yeah.

5234
02:28:51,990 --> 02:28:52,681
Or you know,

5235
02:28:52,681 --> 02:28:53,880
who else wait,

5236
02:28:54,210 --> 02:28:57,960
somebody might say to take up one
questioning position that wasn't used by a

5237
02:28:57,961 --> 02:28:59,580
journalist who would have
asked a tough question.

5238
02:28:59,660 --> 02:29:00,020
Um,

5239
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:00,980
that yes.

5240
02:29:01,010 --> 02:29:01,611
Also,

5241
02:29:01,611 --> 02:29:01,970
um,

5242
02:29:01,970 --> 02:29:04,640
I think there was probably some gay
people that worked in the White House in

5243
02:29:04,641 --> 02:29:08,990
high positions of power that a wanted
this guy around for various reasons.

5244
02:29:09,360 --> 02:29:10,320
And again,

5245
02:29:10,540 --> 02:29:11,373
no answer to that.

5246
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:13,940
What is the name of bushes?

5247
02:29:13,941 --> 02:29:14,900
A key strategist.

5248
02:29:14,901 --> 02:29:15,770
What's that guy's name again?

5249
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:16,620
Which key strategies?

5250
02:29:16,620 --> 02:29:16,770
The,

5251
02:29:16,770 --> 02:29:16,990
the,

5252
02:29:16,990 --> 02:29:17,201
the,

5253
02:29:17,201 --> 02:29:22,160
the controversial guy that we believe
that Mitt Romney won or lost the last

5254
02:29:22,161 --> 02:29:22,640
election.

5255
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:22,820
Oh,

5256
02:29:22,820 --> 02:29:24,060
that was Carl Rah Rah.

5257
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:26,720
He's a GOP stretch GOP strategist.

5258
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:27,830
Famously.

5259
02:29:27,831 --> 02:29:28,664
Probably gay,

5260
02:29:29,300 --> 02:29:29,811
famously,

5261
02:29:29,811 --> 02:29:30,644
probably.

5262
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:31,873
Right.

5263
02:29:31,910 --> 02:29:33,080
I know nothing about this.

5264
02:29:33,081 --> 02:29:35,240
If for lawsuit purposes
and for lawsuit purposes,

5265
02:29:35,241 --> 02:29:39,500
I'm out of my fucking mind and on
narcotics there's so much Kathy,

5266
02:29:40,120 --> 02:29:41,720
the fungus free coffees it to you.

5267
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:43,170
I'm out of my head right now.

5268
02:29:43,350 --> 02:29:44,550
So that's not slander.

5269
02:29:44,551 --> 02:29:45,350
It's insanity.

5270
02:29:45,350 --> 02:29:46,020
It's not,

5271
02:29:46,020 --> 02:29:46,451
you know what,

5272
02:29:46,451 --> 02:29:46,870
listen,

5273
02:29:46,870 --> 02:29:47,703
Jeff Gannon,

5274
02:29:47,770 --> 02:29:48,700
I fucked them.

5275
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:49,540
Oh,

5276
02:29:49,540 --> 02:29:50,860
a slander myself too.

5277
02:29:51,150 --> 02:29:53,200
You can't take anything I say seriously.

5278
02:29:53,350 --> 02:29:54,790
But this gentlemen,

5279
02:29:55,750 --> 02:29:56,583
Jeff Gannon,

5280
02:29:56,710 --> 02:30:00,970
he was a given credentials between
2003 in 2005 for two years.

5281
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:02,350
He was a White House reporter.

5282
02:30:02,470 --> 02:30:05,010
He was a eventually employed
by the conservative website,

5283
02:30:05,020 --> 02:30:06,160
Talon News,

5284
02:30:06,470 --> 02:30:06,730
uh,

5285
02:30:06,730 --> 02:30:08,110
during the latter part of this period.

5286
02:30:08,260 --> 02:30:08,801
So,

5287
02:30:08,801 --> 02:30:09,070
uh,

5288
02:30:09,070 --> 02:30:10,420
he was asking,

5289
02:30:10,670 --> 02:30:11,540
there were,

5290
02:30:11,610 --> 02:30:14,830
there were worried that he was
asking questions so friendly.

5291
02:30:14,831 --> 02:30:18,490
This is in quotes that they might have
been planted and this is how people were,

5292
02:30:18,491 --> 02:30:18,701
uh,

5293
02:30:18,701 --> 02:30:19,211
were,

5294
02:30:19,211 --> 02:30:20,740
were trying to,

5295
02:30:20,741 --> 02:30:21,220
uh,

5296
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:21,521
you know,

5297
02:30:21,521 --> 02:30:22,390
look into this guy.

5298
02:30:22,391 --> 02:30:26,110
So they found out that
he had some website.

5299
02:30:26,290 --> 02:30:26,561
Let me,

5300
02:30:26,561 --> 02:30:29,260
let me find the name of the website
cause it's fucking ridiculous.

5301
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:31,170
It's like a,

5302
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:34,180
the super gay super,

5303
02:30:34,210 --> 02:30:36,190
super gay military website.

5304
02:30:36,860 --> 02:30:37,870
If anybody could see me right now.

5305
02:30:37,871 --> 02:30:41,110
My mouth is wide open though cause really
I had not heard of this story and I'm

5306
02:30:41,111 --> 02:30:43,810
just thinking about what it
took for me to get a press pass,

5307
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:47,380
not to see the president and
this guy had to be fingerprinted,

5308
02:30:47,470 --> 02:30:50,260
background check and the whole
thing and made it through all that.

5309
02:30:50,320 --> 02:30:50,770
Yes.

5310
02:30:50,770 --> 02:30:51,041
Yes.

5311
02:30:51,041 --> 02:30:52,180
Because he was someone's boyfriend.

5312
02:30:52,300 --> 02:30:53,500
I'm almost positive.

5313
02:30:53,501 --> 02:30:55,960
But you gotta be a lot of people's
boyfriends cause there's a lot of people

5314
02:30:55,961 --> 02:30:57,390
you've got to get through
to get to that gate.

5315
02:30:57,430 --> 02:31:01,090
Well he ran a whole website where he was,

5316
02:31:01,150 --> 02:31:02,740
had male escorts.

5317
02:31:03,160 --> 02:31:03,460
Yeah.

5318
02:31:03,460 --> 02:31:06,610
So this is like the Barney frank story
where he's got the intern running the

5319
02:31:06,611 --> 02:31:07,820
house of prostitution and,

5320
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:08,471
exactly.

5321
02:31:08,471 --> 02:31:09,120
That's funny.

5322
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:09,791
Just check your head.

5323
02:31:09,791 --> 02:31:10,571
I mean it's not funny,

5324
02:31:10,571 --> 02:31:11,410
but you know what I mean.

5325
02:31:11,620 --> 02:31:12,460
Check by history.

5326
02:31:14,710 --> 02:31:15,543
Um,

5327
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:17,171
I'll find his,

5328
02:31:17,171 --> 02:31:17,590
his,

5329
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:19,350
his website here cause was,

5330
02:31:19,360 --> 02:31:20,193
it was like a richness.

5331
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:22,080
Now that's my next question.

5332
02:31:22,081 --> 02:31:22,890
What's he do now?

5333
02:31:22,890 --> 02:31:23,310
Uh,

5334
02:31:23,310 --> 02:31:24,750
I think he's a blogger.

5335
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:25,680
Coughing keys.

5336
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:27,330
Got Congressman from Nebraska.

5337
02:31:28,070 --> 02:31:28,903
Um,

5338
02:31:28,950 --> 02:31:33,060
he came out in 2006 after it was all over,

5339
02:31:33,061 --> 02:31:36,930
but he was a $200 an
hour male escorts cheat.

5340
02:31:37,140 --> 02:31:37,560
Yeah.

5341
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:38,520
That's not a lot of money,

5342
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:40,320
but you're dealing with a long time ago.

5343
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:43,470
You're dealing with the two thousands.

5344
02:31:43,820 --> 02:31:44,100
Um,

5345
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:44,401
it's,

5346
02:31:44,401 --> 02:31:44,611
it's,

5347
02:31:44,611 --> 02:31:48,410
it's quite fascinating because this
is also something that really kind of

5348
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:50,040
disappeared under the radar.

5349
02:31:50,190 --> 02:31:52,380
I gotta be honest with you and
now that you brought it all up,

5350
02:31:52,560 --> 02:31:53,430
I don't remember this.

5351
02:31:53,490 --> 02:31:54,151
That's crazy.

5352
02:31:54,151 --> 02:31:54,451
I don't know.

5353
02:31:54,451 --> 02:31:55,540
And I can really informed.

5354
02:31:55,590 --> 02:31:56,520
I don't remember any of this.

5355
02:31:56,550 --> 02:31:56,911
Oh,

5356
02:31:56,911 --> 02:31:57,601
that's crazy.

5357
02:31:57,601 --> 02:31:58,860
How could you call yourself pretty,

5358
02:31:59,130 --> 02:31:59,963
you'll know about that.

5359
02:31:59,980 --> 02:32:01,980
I've been proven wrong actually.

5360
02:32:01,981 --> 02:32:03,680
I'm not following the
right kind of newsfeeds.

5361
02:32:03,690 --> 02:32:04,500
Obviously the,

5362
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:04,921
yeah,

5363
02:32:04,921 --> 02:32:05,311
they,

5364
02:32:05,311 --> 02:32:05,640
um,

5365
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:06,750
they caught him,

5366
02:32:06,950 --> 02:32:07,530
um,

5367
02:32:07,530 --> 02:32:08,131
because,

5368
02:32:08,131 --> 02:32:08,610
uh,

5369
02:32:08,610 --> 02:32:09,031
they,

5370
02:32:09,031 --> 02:32:09,330
you know,

5371
02:32:09,330 --> 02:32:10,950
they just looked into his,

5372
02:32:10,951 --> 02:32:11,190
uh,

5373
02:32:11,190 --> 02:32:14,190
his press credentials because people
couldn't believe that the silly questions

5374
02:32:14,191 --> 02:32:14,930
that he was asking.

5375
02:32:14,930 --> 02:32:17,520
But you look into the press credentials
before you actually get the press

5376
02:32:17,521 --> 02:32:18,031
credentials.

5377
02:32:18,031 --> 02:32:18,960
That's how it goes.

5378
02:32:18,961 --> 02:32:19,560
There's a,

5379
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:22,710
there's a law enforcement person
signature on the press credentials.

5380
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:23,910
I mean I've,

5381
02:32:23,910 --> 02:32:27,660
I've done nothing really bad and my
background and I remember sweating out me

5382
02:32:27,661 --> 02:32:28,800
getting press credentials,

5383
02:32:29,310 --> 02:32:31,940
I'm having a hard time finding
the name of his website is,

5384
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,150
this is an interesting,

5385
02:32:33,630 --> 02:32:37,530
but he had naked pictures on a
bunch of different gay escort sites.

5386
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:39,751
Well,

5387
02:32:39,751 --> 02:32:43,410
I'm starting to have real doubts about
the secret service and the ability of the

5388
02:32:43,411 --> 02:32:44,340
background checks.

5389
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:46,610
This is what year 2006,

5390
02:32:46,650 --> 02:32:48,330
2003 to 2005.

5391
02:32:48,630 --> 02:32:49,950
This war on terror.

5392
02:32:49,980 --> 02:32:50,520
Oh yeah.

5393
02:32:50,520 --> 02:32:51,300
This is wild.

5394
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:51,570
Yeah.

5395
02:32:51,570 --> 02:32:51,721
Oh,

5396
02:32:51,721 --> 02:32:52,554
it's fascinating stuff.

5397
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:53,700
I think he had a boyfriend.

5398
02:32:53,701 --> 02:32:53,911
I mean,

5399
02:32:53,911 --> 02:32:55,530
I think it's unquestionable.

5400
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:56,880
Do you remember when that,

5401
02:32:56,881 --> 02:32:57,390
um,

5402
02:32:57,390 --> 02:32:59,400
madam in Washington DC,

5403
02:32:59,580 --> 02:33:00,000
uh,

5404
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:04,020
came out with a whole list of different
senators and she wasn't a Heidi Fleiss

5405
02:33:04,021 --> 02:33:04,291
thing,

5406
02:33:04,291 --> 02:33:04,660
was it?

5407
02:33:04,660 --> 02:33:04,791
No,

5408
02:33:04,791 --> 02:33:04,841
no,

5409
02:33:04,841 --> 02:33:05,041
no.

5410
02:33:05,041 --> 02:33:06,210
This is the DC Madam.

5411
02:33:06,211 --> 02:33:08,610
Then she turned out she
committed suicide and all the,

5412
02:33:08,611 --> 02:33:09,090
all the,

5413
02:33:09,090 --> 02:33:09,531
all the,

5414
02:33:09,531 --> 02:33:09,720
uh,

5415
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:10,740
the names disappeared.

5416
02:33:10,770 --> 02:33:11,603
Of course.

5417
02:33:12,410 --> 02:33:13,380
I remember the story.

5418
02:33:13,381 --> 02:33:13,531
Yeah.

5419
02:33:13,531 --> 02:33:13,861
That one.

5420
02:33:13,861 --> 02:33:14,520
I do remember.

5421
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:15,930
That was on my RSS feed.

5422
02:33:15,931 --> 02:33:16,530
Yes.

5423
02:33:16,530 --> 02:33:17,071
I guess.

5424
02:33:17,071 --> 02:33:17,370
Uh,

5425
02:33:17,370 --> 02:33:20,430
she wasn't as good at keeping her
mouth shut as this Jeff Gannon dude.

5426
02:33:20,431 --> 02:33:24,000
Or keep it in his mouth open or having
enough secrets somewhere where he goes,

5427
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:24,510
I got,

5428
02:33:24,510 --> 02:33:27,600
I've got Julian Assange is
going to release this with
a secret code if anything

5429
02:33:27,601 --> 02:33:28,261
happens to me.

5430
02:33:28,261 --> 02:33:28,821
Automatic.

5431
02:33:28,821 --> 02:33:29,520
Oh yeah,

5432
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:30,001
please.

5433
02:33:30,001 --> 02:33:33,750
I don't want to ruin my great country
by telling how many of you guys are

5434
02:33:33,751 --> 02:33:35,460
fucking each other behind closed doors.

5435
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:36,600
Um,

5436
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:37,170
yeah.

5437
02:33:37,170 --> 02:33:37,681
This was,

5438
02:33:37,681 --> 02:33:37,980
uh,

5439
02:33:37,980 --> 02:33:39,990
this was one of my
favorite stories though,

5440
02:33:39,991 --> 02:33:44,130
about how you can't trust the press
because who put the press into that

5441
02:33:44,131 --> 02:33:44,550
position?

5442
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:45,390
Especially during,

5443
02:33:45,660 --> 02:33:45,841
I mean,

5444
02:33:45,841 --> 02:33:47,700
that was one of the things that
people had commented about,

5445
02:33:47,701 --> 02:33:48,870
about the Bush administration.

5446
02:33:48,871 --> 02:33:48,991
Like,

5447
02:33:48,991 --> 02:33:49,111
wow,

5448
02:33:49,111 --> 02:33:50,610
this is the first time like,

5449
02:33:50,900 --> 02:33:51,110
uh,

5450
02:33:51,110 --> 02:33:54,150
an administration has been so
transparent about its corruption,

5451
02:33:54,151 --> 02:33:56,700
so transparent about
the influences that has,

5452
02:33:56,701 --> 02:33:57,600
has that,

5453
02:33:57,601 --> 02:33:58,080
you know,

5454
02:33:58,080 --> 02:34:01,680
the influences by Halbert and Halbert
and CEO all of a sudden is now the vice

5455
02:34:01,681 --> 02:34:05,760
president and Halliburton's making
billions of dollars in it and no bid

5456
02:34:05,761 --> 02:34:06,331
contracts.

5457
02:34:06,331 --> 02:34:06,780
I mean,

5458
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:08,250
it was so obvious and corrupt.

5459
02:34:08,251 --> 02:34:12,270
And then here's this guy in the White
House embedded White House reporter

5460
02:34:12,390 --> 02:34:16,110
lobbing these ridiculous questions and
it turns out to be he's a gay escort.

5461
02:34:16,170 --> 02:34:16,861
I really think,

5462
02:34:16,861 --> 02:34:17,980
I think it's the war

5463
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:21,010
on terror and the that that makes it,

5464
02:34:21,670 --> 02:34:25,060
you able to be so open
about the corruption because
what are you going to do?

5465
02:34:25,390 --> 02:34:26,110
I mean we have,

5466
02:34:26,110 --> 02:34:30,040
we have extreme wartime authority till
the war's over now there will be no end

5467
02:34:30,041 --> 02:34:30,311
to the war.

5468
02:34:30,311 --> 02:34:31,750
Well here's the thing,

5469
02:34:31,930 --> 02:34:33,040
how can it end?

5470
02:34:33,250 --> 02:34:33,910
That's what I always,

5471
02:34:33,910 --> 02:34:34,240
you know,

5472
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:38,080
one of the memes we had going on our
show was was how do you end a war on

5473
02:34:38,081 --> 02:34:38,800
terror?

5474
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:39,380
There is,

5475
02:34:39,380 --> 02:34:40,660
there is no way to,

5476
02:34:40,960 --> 02:34:42,520
there's nobody just surrender to you.

5477
02:34:42,521 --> 02:34:42,880
There's,

5478
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:44,770
and if you called off the war tomorrow,

5479
02:34:44,771 --> 02:34:47,950
there's nothing that prevents the next
president after some minor little terror

5480
02:34:47,951 --> 02:34:50,710
attack in any part of the
world from calling it on again.

5481
02:34:50,711 --> 02:34:55,300
I mean if we really cared about the
direction the country was going long term,

5482
02:34:55,540 --> 02:34:59,470
you would realize and a
lot of good writers and
constitutional law scholars have

5483
02:34:59,740 --> 02:35:01,630
that this is an open hole and things.

5484
02:35:01,631 --> 02:35:05,110
I mean you're allowed to basically
suspend the constitution until the war's

5485
02:35:05,111 --> 02:35:05,710
over.

5486
02:35:05,710 --> 02:35:07,030
And yet it's one of those wars that,

5487
02:35:07,031 --> 02:35:07,211
I mean,

5488
02:35:07,211 --> 02:35:07,631
you can't say,

5489
02:35:07,631 --> 02:35:08,860
once we take Berlin,

5490
02:35:08,890 --> 02:35:10,210
everything goes back to normal.

5491
02:35:10,540 --> 02:35:13,360
There is no end to this and this
and there's no end to what you can,

5492
02:35:13,361 --> 02:35:13,870
like you said,

5493
02:35:13,870 --> 02:35:15,790
no end to what you can call terrorism.

5494
02:35:16,060 --> 02:35:16,540
I mean it just,

5495
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:17,230
it's like saying,

5496
02:35:17,230 --> 02:35:17,471
okay,

5497
02:35:17,471 --> 02:35:20,770
we're going to have a war on crime and
as soon as it's over we can get the

5498
02:35:20,771 --> 02:35:21,700
constitution back.

5499
02:35:21,730 --> 02:35:24,020
Couldn't we just change
the definition of terror?

5500
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:25,161
Yeah,

5501
02:35:25,161 --> 02:35:25,600
but,

5502
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:25,981
but that,

5503
02:35:25,981 --> 02:35:27,810
that's where we're going.

5504
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:28,420
That's where we went.

5505
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:28,870
Exactly.

5506
02:35:28,870 --> 02:35:29,600
Holes.

5507
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:30,970
It's a war on tickling a,

5508
02:35:30,971 --> 02:35:35,590
he's actually a blogger now
for the national press club
for the weight from the

5509
02:35:35,590 --> 02:35:35,620
National Press Club.

5510
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:36,040
Yep.

5511
02:35:36,040 --> 02:35:37,060
That's not a group of,

5512
02:35:37,150 --> 02:35:38,530
that's not a like side,

5513
02:35:38,531 --> 02:35:42,080
that's a pretty influential
halfway normal groups.

5514
02:35:42,081 --> 02:35:43,420
Or there's an l in that club.

5515
02:35:44,350 --> 02:35:45,850
Is he a really good writer?

5516
02:35:46,170 --> 02:35:46,560
Is,

5517
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:47,021
he's awesome.

5518
02:35:47,021 --> 02:35:47,620
It's sucking deck.

5519
02:35:47,620 --> 02:35:49,720
I bet he can turn a phrase really well.

5520
02:35:49,721 --> 02:35:51,550
And he's the Hunter Thompson of gay media.

5521
02:35:51,940 --> 02:35:52,773
Yeah,

5522
02:35:53,180 --> 02:35:54,970
the honor Thompson of gay media.

5523
02:35:55,270 --> 02:35:56,350
That's hilarious.

5524
02:35:56,500 --> 02:35:58,000
He should sell shirts that say that.

5525
02:35:58,090 --> 02:35:58,923
I'll leave that to you again.

5526
02:35:59,150 --> 02:36:00,340
You have the better ecommerce.

5527
02:36:01,050 --> 02:36:01,930
I should sell shirts.

5528
02:36:01,931 --> 02:36:02,681
I don't want his money.

5529
02:36:02,681 --> 02:36:04,240
He should sell shirts that say that.

5530
02:36:04,390 --> 02:36:06,640
I'm the Hunter Thompson of gay media.

5531
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:07,833
Dan Carlin,

5532
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:11,600
which will allow him to
use it while she meant I'm,

5533
02:36:11,730 --> 02:36:13,910
it's making me out to
be the Hunter Thompson.

5534
02:36:14,130 --> 02:36:14,510
No,

5535
02:36:14,510 --> 02:36:16,570
he showed wife will be so surprised.

5536
02:36:16,690 --> 02:36:17,830
That's confusing.

5537
02:36:17,980 --> 02:36:18,251
No,

5538
02:36:18,251 --> 02:36:19,001
that's not what I meant.

5539
02:36:19,001 --> 02:36:21,670
I meant you calling Jeff Gannon to
a hundred times that of gay media.

5540
02:36:21,790 --> 02:36:22,623
If he shared,

5541
02:36:22,950 --> 02:36:24,250
but he can put it on a book jacket.

5542
02:36:24,251 --> 02:36:25,084
A blurb.

5543
02:36:25,870 --> 02:36:28,240
Dan Carlin calls him the
Hunter Thompson of gay media.

5544
02:36:28,270 --> 02:36:29,230
Well he's out now,

5545
02:36:29,231 --> 02:36:30,070
so I guess he could.

5546
02:36:30,071 --> 02:36:30,820
He could,

5547
02:36:30,820 --> 02:36:31,560
you know.

5548
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:32,261
Well I'll email them.

5549
02:36:32,261 --> 02:36:33,041
You got to staff here.

5550
02:36:33,041 --> 02:36:35,590
You people can even my staff
is virtually imaginary.

5551
02:36:35,620 --> 02:36:35,741
Oh,

5552
02:36:35,741 --> 02:36:36,640
this is even better.

5553
02:36:36,700 --> 02:36:41,700
His professional name in the
homosexual escort service was bulldog.

5554
02:36:42,250 --> 02:36:44,260
His professional name was bulldog.

5555
02:36:44,860 --> 02:36:45,910
Oh Jesus.

5556
02:36:45,911 --> 02:36:47,880
God helps makes bones,

5557
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,860
but I don't know cause
it's cause it's sexy.

5558
02:36:50,930 --> 02:36:51,460
No,

5559
02:36:51,460 --> 02:36:53,310
fucking bulldog is.

5560
02:36:53,380 --> 02:36:55,390
This is a picture of him from his website

5561
02:36:56,980 --> 02:36:57,760
for rail.

5562
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:59,360
That was an embedded White House report.

5563
02:36:59,670 --> 02:37:01,420
Well and listen just for
the audience out there,

5564
02:37:01,421 --> 02:37:01,891
it doesn't go well.

5565
02:37:01,891 --> 02:37:02,724
I guess you can.

5566
02:37:03,150 --> 02:37:04,890
It's not the homosexual thing.

5567
02:37:04,891 --> 02:37:06,630
It's the stereotypical,

5568
02:37:07,080 --> 02:37:09,200
I was a government plant in a,

5569
02:37:09,201 --> 02:37:10,034
I mean there's,

5570
02:37:10,140 --> 02:37:11,460
it is almost like a fiction.

5571
02:37:11,770 --> 02:37:12,491
Well it's also,

5572
02:37:12,491 --> 02:37:14,560
it goes back to the secrecy in,

5573
02:37:14,561 --> 02:37:16,280
in our government that for sure

5574
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:17,113
someone in there,

5575
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:19,650
I ain't for sure someone
in there has a boyfriend.

5576
02:37:19,690 --> 02:37:20,390
I did.

5577
02:37:20,390 --> 02:37:20,870
Again,

5578
02:37:20,870 --> 02:37:22,760
why was nobody asked about this?

5579
02:37:22,820 --> 02:37:25,460
Can you please explain to me how
he got the press credentials?

5580
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:27,740
We can know all about
portraying his girlfriend,

5581
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:30,110
but we can't know how this
guy got the press credentials.

5582
02:37:30,111 --> 02:37:30,870
I don't understand.

5583
02:37:30,870 --> 02:37:31,650
Yeah.

5584
02:37:31,650 --> 02:37:31,951
Yeah.

5585
02:37:31,951 --> 02:37:33,060
Nobody wants to ask

5586
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:34,160
what about white wave?

5587
02:37:34,190 --> 02:37:37,070
But the reason no one wants to ask is
because everybody else in government who

5588
02:37:37,071 --> 02:37:37,821
would ask this question,

5589
02:37:37,821 --> 02:37:40,610
who gets access is innocent
and not gay like him,

5590
02:37:40,611 --> 02:37:42,500
but it's just planted people.

5591
02:37:42,860 --> 02:37:45,080
I mean it's like watching
meet the press now.

5592
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:47,840
Am I the only person that
thinks David Gregory is,

5593
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:49,310
I mean he's a softball pitcher.

5594
02:37:49,311 --> 02:37:49,791
Literally.

5595
02:37:49,791 --> 02:37:51,170
I mean watch this and you just go,

5596
02:37:51,440 --> 02:37:53,030
how is this satisfying to,

5597
02:37:53,031 --> 02:37:53,661
no offense,

5598
02:37:53,661 --> 02:37:54,171
NBC,

5599
02:37:54,171 --> 02:37:54,690
but,

5600
02:37:54,690 --> 02:37:55,271
but how,

5601
02:37:55,271 --> 02:37:56,320
how is the satisfy?

5602
02:37:56,321 --> 02:37:57,154
How has this,

5603
02:37:57,280 --> 02:37:57,920
I don't,

5604
02:37:57,920 --> 02:37:59,290
I don't understand media anymore.

5605
02:37:59,540 --> 02:38:00,371
The mainstream,

5606
02:38:00,371 --> 02:38:00,450
yeah.

5607
02:38:00,450 --> 02:38:05,450
Media's approach in the sort of con
those conversation shows about a serious

5608
02:38:05,731 --> 02:38:06,151
issues.

5609
02:38:06,151 --> 02:38:06,451
It's like,

5610
02:38:06,451 --> 02:38:06,781
boy,

5611
02:38:06,781 --> 02:38:07,091
they,

5612
02:38:07,091 --> 02:38:10,470
they are softball down the middle lobs.

5613
02:38:10,471 --> 02:38:11,310
Everything is,

5614
02:38:11,460 --> 02:38:11,791
there's,

5615
02:38:11,791 --> 02:38:13,850
there's no real controversy
when it comes to them.

5616
02:38:14,760 --> 02:38:15,830
Journalists learn issues.

5617
02:38:15,890 --> 02:38:19,400
A real journalist would look at
something like Wikipedia and if,

5618
02:38:19,430 --> 02:38:20,660
if they couldn't support it,

5619
02:38:20,661 --> 02:38:22,910
they'd certainly have a soft
spot in their heart for it.

5620
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:23,840
If I recall,

5621
02:38:23,841 --> 02:38:26,510
mainstream journalism was
horrified at Wikipedia.

5622
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:28,310
That doesn't ring true to me.

5623
02:38:28,311 --> 02:38:30,220
But while you can't just
publish these secrets thing,

5624
02:38:30,380 --> 02:38:32,000
well you have to do something.

5625
02:38:32,001 --> 02:38:32,420
Don't you?

5626
02:38:32,420 --> 02:38:33,253
Wiki leaks,

5627
02:38:33,850 --> 02:38:34,683
wiki media,

5628
02:38:35,710 --> 02:38:36,250
wikis.

5629
02:38:36,250 --> 02:38:36,761
He was sorted.

5630
02:38:36,761 --> 02:38:37,900
I thank you for clarifying that.

5631
02:38:38,130 --> 02:38:38,970
Baffled by why?

5632
02:38:39,050 --> 02:38:39,630
Um,

5633
02:38:39,630 --> 02:38:39,931
yeah,

5634
02:38:39,931 --> 02:38:40,261
I mean,

5635
02:38:40,261 --> 02:38:40,580
um,

5636
02:38:40,580 --> 02:38:40,740
uh,

5637
02:38:40,740 --> 02:38:41,311
I think,

5638
02:38:41,311 --> 02:38:41,880
uh,

5639
02:38:41,880 --> 02:38:45,090
access to information when it
exposes crime is always good.

5640
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:45,540
Uh,

5641
02:38:45,540 --> 02:38:46,560
if it exposes crime,

5642
02:38:46,561 --> 02:38:47,490
that's irrational crime.

5643
02:38:47,540 --> 02:38:47,821
You know,

5644
02:38:47,821 --> 02:38:48,061
I mean,

5645
02:38:48,061 --> 02:38:51,210
I'm not talking about like
a beating off or something,

5646
02:38:51,510 --> 02:38:52,343
smoking pot,

5647
02:38:52,410 --> 02:38:53,940
something victimless crime.

5648
02:38:54,060 --> 02:38:54,451
But when you're,

5649
02:38:54,451 --> 02:38:56,130
when you're talking about real corruption,

5650
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:56,641
corruption,

5651
02:38:56,641 --> 02:39:01,590
being exposed by a wiki leaks or
being exposed by the New York Times,

5652
02:39:01,740 --> 02:39:06,000
which he should be upset about always
is the corruption and you should praise

5653
02:39:06,001 --> 02:39:11,001
always whatever method of access to
information has been utilized in order to

5654
02:39:11,431 --> 02:39:12,270
get it out to the people,

5655
02:39:12,271 --> 02:39:13,260
whether it's a website,

5656
02:39:13,261 --> 02:39:14,490
whether it's The New York Times,

5657
02:39:14,820 --> 02:39:17,610
it's like you should be happy that
the New York Times exposes things.

5658
02:39:17,611 --> 02:39:22,230
You should be happy that Woodward
and Bernstein broke Watergate.

5659
02:39:22,231 --> 02:39:22,630
I mean,

5660
02:39:22,630 --> 02:39:23,760
we should all be happy.

5661
02:39:23,930 --> 02:39:27,570
I think there's a simpler rule and the
simpler rule is will we be worse or

5662
02:39:27,571 --> 02:39:32,250
better off with more information or less
information and a great way of putting

5663
02:39:32,251 --> 02:39:33,000
it.

5664
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:37,560
I have yet to find someone who can
really explain to me that that tradeoff

5665
02:39:37,890 --> 02:39:40,440
argues in favor of keeping things secret.

5666
02:39:40,830 --> 02:39:41,100
Um,

5667
02:39:41,100 --> 02:39:41,581
somebody will say,

5668
02:39:41,581 --> 02:39:41,701
well,

5669
02:39:41,701 --> 02:39:43,900
we'll lose an agent in
this or that city and that,

5670
02:39:43,901 --> 02:39:44,101
that,

5671
02:39:44,101 --> 02:39:45,420
that's a breach of trust.

5672
02:39:45,421 --> 02:39:49,680
And I understand that at the same time
this country is dying from lack of

5673
02:39:49,681 --> 02:39:53,520
investigative journalism and uncovering
malfeasance and corruption and all these

5674
02:39:53,521 --> 02:39:53,880
things.

5675
02:39:53,880 --> 02:39:58,020
You can't tell me that the protection
of a source here or there outweighs what

5676
02:39:58,021 --> 02:39:59,130
we're seeing all around us.

5677
02:39:59,440 --> 02:40:04,360
So this weird thing that happened
after September 11th where uh,

5678
02:40:04,910 --> 02:40:09,490
it was very scary to me where all of
a sudden no one wanted to question the

5679
02:40:09,491 --> 02:40:10,270
government.

5680
02:40:10,270 --> 02:40:12,970
Everyone wanted to support the government,

5681
02:40:13,470 --> 02:40:14,010
the troops

5682
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:16,950
support whatever hard
decisions that had to be made,

5683
02:40:16,951 --> 02:40:20,580
but no one wanted to have any
of the healthy skepticism.

5684
02:40:21,330 --> 02:40:24,510
That's why we have to have a cooling
off period after the next one because

5685
02:40:24,870 --> 02:40:25,703
here's the way it goes.

5686
02:40:25,830 --> 02:40:28,080
If the experts say and they do that,

5687
02:40:28,081 --> 02:40:29,100
we're going to get hit again,

5688
02:40:29,101 --> 02:40:30,630
that it's inevitable
that you can't stop it.

5689
02:40:30,631 --> 02:40:31,500
It's going to happen.

5690
02:40:31,740 --> 02:40:35,550
And if you know you are going to
freak out when it happens again,

5691
02:40:35,551 --> 02:40:37,260
we're not talking about
like a little teeny attack.

5692
02:40:37,261 --> 02:40:40,270
We're talking about another two buildings
go down or there's a nuclear attack in

5693
02:40:40,271 --> 02:40:41,104
a harbor or you know,

5694
02:40:41,250 --> 02:40:42,450
pick your worst case scenario.

5695
02:40:42,570 --> 02:40:46,080
If you know that you're going to be
crazy and ready to rip up the constant,

5696
02:40:46,130 --> 02:40:46,440
Hey,

5697
02:40:46,440 --> 02:40:49,380
we're going to legislate during
a period of temporary insanity.

5698
02:40:49,500 --> 02:40:51,210
If you really want to save the country,

5699
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:52,590
write some rules about that.

5700
02:40:52,590 --> 02:40:54,750
Now say we're going to
be out of our minds.

5701
02:40:54,751 --> 02:40:55,530
Let's make some,

5702
02:40:55,530 --> 02:40:56,640
let's put some speed bumps.

5703
02:40:56,641 --> 02:40:57,120
Let's say you,

5704
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:59,070
you can't legislate for 60 days.

5705
02:40:59,180 --> 02:40:59,400
Well,

5706
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:00,990
you can close loopholes
that let the terror,

5707
02:41:00,991 --> 02:41:02,580
you know that we found a
loophole that led him in.

5708
02:41:02,670 --> 02:41:03,503
You can close that,

5709
02:41:03,570 --> 02:41:07,740
but let's not write any Patriot Act
three until we've had enough time to calm

5710
02:41:07,741 --> 02:41:08,370
down.

5711
02:41:08,370 --> 02:41:12,270
What blows me away is the way that they
sold the Patriot Act to us was by saying

5712
02:41:12,271 --> 02:41:13,410
there's a sunset clause.

5713
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:14,280
It's gotta be renewed.

5714
02:41:14,281 --> 02:41:14,580
Right?

5715
02:41:14,580 --> 02:41:15,271
Don't be afraid.

5716
02:41:15,271 --> 02:41:16,104
This isn't permanent.

5717
02:41:16,140 --> 02:41:17,220
It's got to be renewed.

5718
02:41:17,610 --> 02:41:18,720
It's been renewed every time.

5719
02:41:18,810 --> 02:41:21,480
It's been renewed every time with no,

5720
02:41:21,481 --> 02:41:22,590
it's not even close.

5721
02:41:22,620 --> 02:41:23,191
Not only that,

5722
02:41:23,191 --> 02:41:25,920
most people are not aware that it's
legislation that was written far before

5723
02:41:25,921 --> 02:41:27,540
September 11th but couldn't get past.

5724
02:41:27,570 --> 02:41:28,590
Peter Defazio's told me,

5725
02:41:28,591 --> 02:41:28,790
I haven't,

5726
02:41:28,790 --> 02:41:29,281
I suppose to say this,

5727
02:41:29,281 --> 02:41:29,850
maybe it would be.

5728
02:41:29,850 --> 02:41:30,181
He said,

5729
02:41:30,181 --> 02:41:30,780
listen,

5730
02:41:30,780 --> 02:41:31,591
a lot of this stuff,

5731
02:41:31,591 --> 02:41:36,591
you can't write a giant Patriot Act like
that in the time it took to actually

5732
02:41:36,601 --> 02:41:37,230
write it.

5733
02:41:37,230 --> 02:41:37,531
He goes,

5734
02:41:37,531 --> 02:41:39,930
a lot of these were sitting
on the shelf things.

5735
02:41:39,931 --> 02:41:44,070
I mean you think about a standalone laws
and they just pick this stuff off the

5736
02:41:44,071 --> 02:41:44,780
shelf through it.

5737
02:41:44,780 --> 02:41:46,320
And what a lot of people don't know,

5738
02:41:46,350 --> 02:41:48,030
although this happens with a lot of laws,

5739
02:41:48,270 --> 02:41:52,230
is that there's a lot of blank spaces
because people don't quite know how it's

5740
02:41:52,231 --> 02:41:53,064
gonna work out.

5741
02:41:53,100 --> 02:41:54,390
So when you sign these things,

5742
02:41:54,391 --> 02:41:58,080
you actually signed something with
a lot of blank spaces because,

5743
02:41:58,081 --> 02:41:58,980
and this happens with a lot of us,

5744
02:41:58,981 --> 02:42:00,780
cause they don't know the specifics yet.

5745
02:42:00,781 --> 02:42:02,670
It's not that it's part of the scheme or,

5746
02:42:02,820 --> 02:42:04,650
or the trying to to
slip something through.

5747
02:42:04,800 --> 02:42:05,910
A lot of times with these laws,

5748
02:42:05,911 --> 02:42:07,680
they don't know the mechanism yet.

5749
02:42:07,890 --> 02:42:10,770
They know that they want to get from a
to C and they're not quite sure how be

5750
02:42:10,771 --> 02:42:11,580
works out yet.

5751
02:42:11,580 --> 02:42:15,360
But you sign onto the concept but you
support C and we'll figure out how to get

5752
02:42:15,361 --> 02:42:17,070
there when we figured
out how to get there.

5753
02:42:17,310 --> 02:42:20,430
And so they sign a lot of these things
that have a lot of blank spaces and how

5754
02:42:20,431 --> 02:42:23,190
few politicians read any of
those things they signed.

5755
02:42:23,191 --> 02:42:27,180
One of the things they've gone over is
like the amount of paperwork that these

5756
02:42:27,181 --> 02:42:29,730
guys would have to read if they
read everything they signed.

5757
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:30,090
Yeah,

5758
02:42:30,090 --> 02:42:30,461
and it's,

5759
02:42:30,461 --> 02:42:32,160
it's impossible and
they've said that they've,

5760
02:42:32,260 --> 02:42:33,510
they've openly admitted that,

5761
02:42:33,511 --> 02:42:33,751
you know,

5762
02:42:33,751 --> 02:42:36,660
there's no way anyone could around all
this stuff in the amount of time you're

5763
02:42:36,661 --> 02:42:37,350
given.

5764
02:42:37,350 --> 02:42:39,030
We have to be able to
read each other's minds.

5765
02:42:39,031 --> 02:42:39,690
Dan Carlin,

5766
02:42:39,690 --> 02:42:41,160
that's where we're going
to fix this whole thing.

5767
02:42:41,270 --> 02:42:42,990
We're going to be able to absolve lies.

5768
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:43,680
We're going to,

5769
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:47,550
we're going to be able to stop all the
nonsense as soon as everyone agrees to

5770
02:42:47,551 --> 02:42:48,330
the neural chip.

5771
02:42:48,330 --> 02:42:51,930
I think if you're going to have a lot of
government people right on your side on

5772
02:42:51,931 --> 02:42:53,070
that job and they're going to be,

5773
02:42:53,250 --> 02:42:53,761
you know what,

5774
02:42:53,761 --> 02:42:54,840
that's just what we were thinking.

5775
02:42:54,841 --> 02:42:55,051
Joe,

5776
02:42:55,051 --> 02:42:56,100
come and work at Darpa.

5777
02:42:56,101 --> 02:42:56,460
The defense.

5778
02:42:56,460 --> 02:42:59,100
We've been thinking about how to read
people's minds for a long time ago there

5779
02:42:59,101 --> 02:43:02,550
and they got robot dogs patrolling
the perimeter at laser beam eyeball.

5780
02:43:02,580 --> 02:43:05,280
I think the bigger danger is they're
already reading your mind and that's the

5781
02:43:05,281 --> 02:43:05,760
problem.

5782
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:05,881
Yeah,

5783
02:43:05,881 --> 02:43:06,221
the big,

5784
02:43:06,221 --> 02:43:08,040
I always said like with clones,

5785
02:43:08,220 --> 02:43:08,581
you know,

5786
02:43:08,581 --> 02:43:12,160
like it's just a matter of
time before they clone like

5787
02:43:13,410 --> 02:43:14,380
acumen,

5788
02:43:15,100 --> 02:43:17,050
hybrid slash.

5789
02:43:17,210 --> 02:43:17,750
Creatures.

5790
02:43:17,750 --> 02:43:20,990
Maybe that explains why the president's
always change on inauguration day.

5791
02:43:20,991 --> 02:43:23,120
Maybe those aren't made me can imagine,

5792
02:43:23,150 --> 02:43:24,560
imagine if that was a
science fiction movie.

5793
02:43:24,710 --> 02:43:27,200
They pull the president into another room
and it's like an invasion of the body

5794
02:43:27,210 --> 02:43:27,970
snatchers.

5795
02:43:27,970 --> 02:43:28,431
Odd wait,

5796
02:43:28,431 --> 02:43:30,110
foaming and growing in the corner.

5797
02:43:30,111 --> 02:43:30,860
Yes.

5798
02:43:30,860 --> 02:43:31,730
I wonder,

5799
02:43:31,770 --> 02:43:32,300
um,

5800
02:43:32,300 --> 02:43:33,080
how

5801
02:43:33,080 --> 02:43:38,080
we're going to keep this sort of a very
flawed system of float over the next

5802
02:43:41,330 --> 02:43:41,670
decade to,

5803
02:43:41,670 --> 02:43:42,501
isn't that what I said?

5804
02:43:42,501 --> 02:43:42,800
I mean,

5805
02:43:42,800 --> 02:43:42,951
it's,

5806
02:43:42,951 --> 02:43:46,300
it's harder to imagine you talk
about revolution on one hand there's,

5807
02:43:46,310 --> 02:43:47,480
I don't want to call it fascism,

5808
02:43:47,481 --> 02:43:49,760
but let's just call it a more
repressive kind of stayed.

5809
02:43:49,761 --> 02:43:50,510
On the other hand,

5810
02:43:50,510 --> 02:43:54,980
it's weirder for me to think of the spaces
that we're in now continuing than it

5811
02:43:54,981 --> 02:43:57,050
is to imagine it going far off into,

5812
02:43:57,140 --> 02:43:58,820
I don't know which
direction it's going to go.

5813
02:43:58,940 --> 02:44:02,450
I just can't imagine we stay in this
weird Netherworld for another 10 years.

5814
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:03,900
Feel that it's a,

5815
02:44:03,970 --> 02:44:08,170
the biggest resistance right now to
governments right now is technological.

5816
02:44:08,200 --> 02:44:08,531
The,

5817
02:44:08,531 --> 02:44:10,480
the anonymous movement and the Wiki leaks.

5818
02:44:10,570 --> 02:44:12,490
But look at how they're
cracking down on that already.

5819
02:44:12,491 --> 02:44:13,330
A lot of countries are,

5820
02:44:13,540 --> 02:44:14,380
I mean we've got,

5821
02:44:14,860 --> 02:44:17,950
I mean the only thing we tend to agree
upon with Iran and stuff is that you need

5822
02:44:17,951 --> 02:44:20,710
a more controlled internet
and those kinds of things.

5823
02:44:20,711 --> 02:44:24,670
And a lot of these countries are starting
to try to form their own regional

5824
02:44:24,820 --> 02:44:28,270
internets that they can control and
everybody will be cells and all,

5825
02:44:28,271 --> 02:44:29,130
all these tech guys will,

5826
02:44:29,131 --> 02:44:30,250
I can't control the Internet.

5827
02:44:30,251 --> 02:44:32,120
It was designed to avert a nuclear war.

5828
02:44:32,121 --> 02:44:33,100
And you know what?

5829
02:44:33,101 --> 02:44:34,900
I'm not so sure those guys are right.

5830
02:44:35,110 --> 02:44:35,950
They say that,

5831
02:44:35,951 --> 02:44:39,760
but the governments of all of the world
are putting in so much effort to this.

5832
02:44:40,090 --> 02:44:43,600
I'm not so sure that then that's just
going to switch us over to another

5833
02:44:43,601 --> 02:44:47,020
internet and then drown the other one
in spam someday so that it becomes

5834
02:44:47,021 --> 02:44:47,854
unusable.

5835
02:44:47,980 --> 02:44:48,490
I mean,

5836
02:44:48,490 --> 02:44:49,323
I don't think they're going to,

5837
02:44:49,810 --> 02:44:50,631
I think the,

5838
02:44:50,631 --> 02:44:50,840
the,

5839
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:53,870
the real issue is who are
the most intelligent people?

5840
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:54,230
What,

5841
02:44:54,230 --> 02:44:55,190
what side are they on?

5842
02:44:55,370 --> 02:44:57,380
The most intelligent people
on the side of the resistance,

5843
02:44:57,381 --> 02:44:59,210
the most intelligent people
in the side of the coders,

5844
02:44:59,211 --> 02:44:59,841
the hackers,

5845
02:44:59,841 --> 02:45:01,940
the people that are are writing software.

5846
02:45:01,941 --> 02:45:02,780
The people that are the,

5847
02:45:02,781 --> 02:45:04,190
the technological innovators,

5848
02:45:04,370 --> 02:45:05,450
they're not government agents.

5849
02:45:05,630 --> 02:45:06,500
Those guys are dummies.

5850
02:45:06,680 --> 02:45:06,921
They,

5851
02:45:06,921 --> 02:45:08,690
that's why they can hack
into the White House.

5852
02:45:08,850 --> 02:45:09,683
Yeah.

5853
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:11,063
Long term.

5854
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:13,530
We talk about a five year
old growing up today,

5855
02:45:13,920 --> 02:45:16,770
are they going to grow up with
this kind of mentality we have.

5856
02:45:16,771 --> 02:45:17,581
This is the problem.

5857
02:45:17,581 --> 02:45:20,580
When you change the constitutional
rights situation slowly,

5858
02:45:20,581 --> 02:45:24,510
the way we have is you begin to grow a
new generation of people that never knew.

5859
02:45:24,511 --> 02:45:26,370
A pre nine 11 world for example,

5860
02:45:26,700 --> 02:45:31,560
that don't have the same feeling we have
about loss of rights or any of these

5861
02:45:31,561 --> 02:45:33,150
other things because they've
never known any better.

5862
02:45:33,720 --> 02:45:36,630
Are you going to get the next generation
of people growing up with a hacker

5863
02:45:36,631 --> 02:45:40,620
mentality or they're going to be every
bit as good on computers is our best

5864
02:45:40,621 --> 02:45:41,454
people are,

5865
02:45:41,670 --> 02:45:44,100
but come from a mentality
that doesn't say,

5866
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:44,581
oh,

5867
02:45:44,581 --> 02:45:46,290
what about our fourth
amendment rights being gone?

5868
02:45:46,291 --> 02:45:46,950
And what about the,

5869
02:45:46,950 --> 02:45:48,600
they've never known any other world.

5870
02:45:48,930 --> 02:45:49,651
That's interesting.

5871
02:45:49,651 --> 02:45:49,941
I don't know.

5872
02:45:49,941 --> 02:45:50,460
Agree.

5873
02:45:50,460 --> 02:45:50,830
Um,

5874
02:45:50,830 --> 02:45:51,140
I know,

5875
02:45:51,140 --> 02:45:53,220
I think that children,

5876
02:45:53,221 --> 02:45:53,941
first of all,

5877
02:45:53,941 --> 02:45:57,420
almost always look at old people like
they're fucking stupid and they've ruined

5878
02:45:57,421 --> 02:45:57,811
everything.

5879
02:45:57,811 --> 02:45:59,880
They might have a point and they
might have a point and then you're,

5880
02:45:59,881 --> 02:46:00,181
you're,

5881
02:46:00,181 --> 02:46:04,380
you're growing up in this society
that they created that they,

5882
02:46:04,381 --> 02:46:07,650
they've been running and they've been
running shittily they'd done a terrible

5883
02:46:07,651 --> 02:46:09,150
job and running this government.

5884
02:46:09,350 --> 02:46:12,830
I don't think anybody's going to be like
a super computer expert and be all Gung

5885
02:46:12,830 --> 02:46:16,520
Ho to his follow protocol as written
because this government is a,

5886
02:46:16,521 --> 02:46:17,780
all wise and all knowing.

5887
02:46:17,781 --> 02:46:17,990
I don't,

5888
02:46:17,990 --> 02:46:18,750
I don't think there's any,

5889
02:46:18,750 --> 02:46:19,583
okay,

5890
02:46:19,670 --> 02:46:19,870
but,

5891
02:46:19,870 --> 02:46:20,740
so if you're the government,

5892
02:46:20,741 --> 02:46:23,140
there's two choices in your
scenario and your scenario.

5893
02:46:23,141 --> 02:46:25,000
One choice is the revolution,

5894
02:46:25,001 --> 02:46:25,541
as you call it,

5895
02:46:25,541 --> 02:46:26,530
the resistance wins.

5896
02:46:26,860 --> 02:46:30,160
The other choice is that if the
government wants to stay in power,

5897
02:46:30,310 --> 02:46:33,550
they crack down more and they turn us
into something that's more repressive than

5898
02:46:33,551 --> 02:46:34,050
it is.

5899
02:46:34,050 --> 02:46:38,670
Well then it gets really tricky because
who is the government when I guess we

5900
02:46:38,671 --> 02:46:39,720
find out Ben don't.

5901
02:46:39,721 --> 02:46:39,990
Yeah,

5902
02:46:39,990 --> 02:46:41,040
because when,

5903
02:46:41,460 --> 02:46:41,791
one of the,

5904
02:46:41,791 --> 02:46:42,240
my point,

5905
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:42,661
one of my,

5906
02:46:42,661 --> 02:46:43,494
um,

5907
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:46,950
one of the points of fascination that
I had about this whole betray thing was

5908
02:46:46,951 --> 02:46:49,380
the fact that it was the government
versus the government and I,

5909
02:46:49,381 --> 02:46:52,890
that was something that I was not aware
of before that the FBI and the CIA don't

5910
02:46:52,891 --> 02:46:53,724
like each other,

5911
02:46:53,820 --> 02:46:54,650
which is

5912
02:46:54,650 --> 02:46:58,100
like when you get the corruption from
the pro marijuana people putting in money

5913
02:46:58,101 --> 02:46:59,390
to campaigns and the now,

5914
02:46:59,391 --> 02:47:01,220
now you see things start
to even out a little.

5915
02:47:01,221 --> 02:47:01,560
Yeah.

5916
02:47:01,560 --> 02:47:03,390
Well also in the marijuana world,

5917
02:47:03,400 --> 02:47:07,580
you see illegal growers who are against
legalization because it would cut down

5918
02:47:07,590 --> 02:47:08,423
their profits.

5919
02:47:08,670 --> 02:47:13,050
There's people who are illegal growers
who voted against medical marijuana and

5920
02:47:13,051 --> 02:47:14,430
that's cannibalism and it's,

5921
02:47:14,850 --> 02:47:16,110
those kinds of things
are very interesting.

5922
02:47:16,310 --> 02:47:16,600
Yeah.

5923
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:18,360
You're always going to
have situations like that?

5924
02:47:18,361 --> 02:47:19,260
I think so.

5925
02:47:19,261 --> 02:47:20,094
It's uh,

5926
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:22,150
I think the,

5927
02:47:22,151 --> 02:47:22,381
the,

5928
02:47:22,381 --> 02:47:26,100
the factions of the government
can't agree on what,

5929
02:47:26,880 --> 02:47:27,360
you know,

5930
02:47:27,360 --> 02:47:27,751
who they are,

5931
02:47:27,751 --> 02:47:30,960
who they're for and who they're not for
the fact that the FBI was willing to go

5932
02:47:30,961 --> 02:47:35,190
after the CIA and that's how this whole
thing happened with betray us and he

5933
02:47:35,191 --> 02:47:35,700
got,

5934
02:47:35,700 --> 02:47:36,090
you know,

5935
02:47:36,090 --> 02:47:37,110
smoked out like that.

5936
02:47:37,111 --> 02:47:38,930
I think that you're,

5937
02:47:39,090 --> 02:47:41,370
you've got too many people and they're,

5938
02:47:41,371 --> 02:47:42,840
they're not a unified front.

5939
02:47:42,870 --> 02:47:45,180
They're not going to get together
and say this is what we need to do.

5940
02:47:45,181 --> 02:47:45,590
We need to,

5941
02:47:45,590 --> 02:47:50,280
I think they will believe that they
can pass laws to try to stop things,

5942
02:47:50,460 --> 02:47:53,340
but while they're doing
this and passing laws,

5943
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:57,420
technology waits for no one and these
people don't understand technology.

5944
02:47:57,421 --> 02:47:58,350
These people are old.

5945
02:47:58,560 --> 02:48:02,730
These people that are in their sixties
and seventies that are in positions of

5946
02:48:02,731 --> 02:48:03,091
power.

5947
02:48:03,091 --> 02:48:06,540
I do not think they truly
appreciate most of them.

5948
02:48:06,541 --> 02:48:10,100
At least truly appreciate
the power of the movement of,

5949
02:48:10,150 --> 02:48:10,530
of,

5950
02:48:10,530 --> 02:48:12,030
of free information on the Internet.

5951
02:48:12,031 --> 02:48:12,430
I don't,

5952
02:48:12,430 --> 02:48:13,130
I don't,

5953
02:48:13,130 --> 02:48:13,280
like

5954
02:48:13,280 --> 02:48:13,671
we said though,

5955
02:48:13,671 --> 02:48:18,470
I think the key is going to be how the
average individuals impacted by the

5956
02:48:18,471 --> 02:48:19,071
changes.

5957
02:48:19,071 --> 02:48:20,150
It's one thing to say,

5958
02:48:20,151 --> 02:48:20,301
hey,

5959
02:48:20,301 --> 02:48:21,170
my life's pretty good.

5960
02:48:21,171 --> 02:48:22,460
I'm going to still play video games.

5961
02:48:22,461 --> 02:48:23,294
I'm fine with my job.

5962
02:48:23,570 --> 02:48:25,100
When they get thrown out of their house,

5963
02:48:25,340 --> 02:48:27,470
when they can't make enough money to live,

5964
02:48:27,471 --> 02:48:28,720
when the American dream is,

5965
02:48:28,750 --> 02:48:32,090
is nowhere near within their reach
and there's enough of those people.

5966
02:48:32,690 --> 02:48:34,670
I think all of a sudden
the motivation changes.

5967
02:48:34,671 --> 02:48:34,881
I mean,

5968
02:48:34,881 --> 02:48:38,960
I had a friend who was a draft
protester in the 1960s and he said,

5969
02:48:38,961 --> 02:48:43,100
the real sad part of the antiwar movement
was how much of it was based on the

5970
02:48:43,101 --> 02:48:46,700
fact that I was going to be drafted
and when Nixon got rid of the draft,

5971
02:48:46,850 --> 02:48:50,120
he did it cynically believing that
a lot of people would then say,

5972
02:48:50,150 --> 02:48:50,271
oh,

5973
02:48:50,271 --> 02:48:51,530
I don't care about the warranty more if I,

5974
02:48:51,531 --> 02:48:52,370
if I'm not going to go,

5975
02:48:52,371 --> 02:48:53,204
I don't care.

5976
02:48:53,390 --> 02:48:54,131
And he was right.

5977
02:48:54,131 --> 02:48:54,631
And the the,

5978
02:48:54,631 --> 02:48:58,940
the membership that the people attending
these anti war rallies plummeted once

5979
02:48:58,941 --> 02:49:00,320
those people weren't going to get drafted.

5980
02:49:01,100 --> 02:49:05,660
If you talk about people being impacted
by a worsening economy and worsening

5981
02:49:05,661 --> 02:49:07,160
conditions and bad government decisions,

5982
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:09,720
pay no attention to what the
average American's lifestyles like.

5983
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:11,910
It's like drafting those people.

5984
02:49:11,940 --> 02:49:15,030
All of a sudden people who had no stake
in this care because they can't afford

5985
02:49:15,060 --> 02:49:18,480
food or they can't afford a TV and they
can't afford cable or whatever it is

5986
02:49:18,481 --> 02:49:19,140
they need.

5987
02:49:19,140 --> 02:49:19,973
Well,

5988
02:49:20,120 --> 02:49:21,330
as we wrap this thing up,

5989
02:49:21,480 --> 02:49:22,470
how do you think,

5990
02:49:22,590 --> 02:49:23,580
if you had to guess,

5991
02:49:23,581 --> 02:49:25,020
I wouldn't want to ask anybody.

5992
02:49:25,820 --> 02:49:26,520
Well,

5993
02:49:26,520 --> 02:49:29,190
you're one of the few people that
would ever asked this question.

5994
02:49:29,460 --> 02:49:32,370
How do you think it's going to
go down over the next 10 years?

5995
02:49:32,371 --> 02:49:35,350
What if you had to guess what is a,

5996
02:49:35,430 --> 02:49:37,050
what's going to take
place in this country?

5997
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:38,520
I told you already my,

5998
02:49:38,550 --> 02:49:41,840
my big fear is that we're going to have
another terror attack because I don't

5999
02:49:41,841 --> 02:49:43,190
see how we avoid that,

6000
02:49:43,191 --> 02:49:46,580
where we're at and it's not just the
terrorist bombing were out there poking,

6001
02:49:46,790 --> 02:49:47,860
poking a nest.

6002
02:49:47,861 --> 02:49:48,860
It's all over the world.

6003
02:49:48,861 --> 02:49:51,680
I mean that's how people respond
in a lot of these places.

6004
02:49:52,040 --> 02:49:53,360
And I think if we get hit again,

6005
02:49:53,361 --> 02:49:54,830
I think we're going to go crazy.

6006
02:49:54,920 --> 02:49:55,970
So you think it's going to be bad?

6007
02:49:56,010 --> 02:49:57,970
You think it's going to be
like right after September 11?

6008
02:49:58,430 --> 02:49:59,130
I don't make,

6009
02:49:59,130 --> 02:50:00,300
I don't see enough positives.

6010
02:50:00,301 --> 02:50:01,560
I just don't see enough positives.

6011
02:50:01,561 --> 02:50:01,880
I mean I,

6012
02:50:01,880 --> 02:50:02,713
I'm hoping,

6013
02:50:02,940 --> 02:50:03,900
but I don't see,

6014
02:50:04,050 --> 02:50:07,440
I don't see enough variables that can
break in the good direction and I see a

6015
02:50:07,441 --> 02:50:09,450
lot of variables that can
break in the bad direction.

6016
02:50:09,451 --> 02:50:09,920
Do you think

6017
02:50:09,920 --> 02:50:10,581
summit we move,

6018
02:50:10,581 --> 02:50:12,530
we're moving towards a
one world government.

6019
02:50:14,810 --> 02:50:16,190
I think that's a weird statement.

6020
02:50:16,220 --> 02:50:16,911
Loaded statement.

6021
02:50:16,911 --> 02:50:18,260
I don't know about one world government.

6022
02:50:18,261 --> 02:50:18,740
I think,

6023
02:50:18,740 --> 02:50:22,490
I think we're moving towards a government
that agrees with a lot of other

6024
02:50:22,491 --> 02:50:26,300
governments about certain things and
one is I don't think most of the world

6025
02:50:26,301 --> 02:50:26,900
governments are,

6026
02:50:26,900 --> 02:50:29,630
are happy about the Internet's ability to,

6027
02:50:29,750 --> 02:50:31,770
I mean they're fine with
us watching cat videos and,

6028
02:50:31,771 --> 02:50:33,470
and having that keep us pacified.

6029
02:50:33,650 --> 02:50:35,540
None of them are happy
about information sharing.

6030
02:50:35,541 --> 02:50:36,980
None of them are happy
about that kind of stuff.

6031
02:50:37,310 --> 02:50:38,143
Uh,

6032
02:50:38,590 --> 02:50:39,970
[inaudible] context though,

6033
02:50:39,971 --> 02:50:42,700
the fact that everyone was
so isolated for so long.

6034
02:50:42,850 --> 02:50:45,400
And then over the last
less than a hundred years,

6035
02:50:45,430 --> 02:50:47,320
there's been this incredible interaction.

6036
02:50:47,321 --> 02:50:48,730
That's how the podcast,

6037
02:50:48,731 --> 02:50:50,080
you hit your heard all over the world.

6038
02:50:50,130 --> 02:50:50,440
Yeah.

6039
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:51,180
Escalated.

6040
02:50:51,180 --> 02:50:53,230
And this is just people shooting the shit,

6041
02:50:53,440 --> 02:50:54,370
but just the,

6042
02:50:54,400 --> 02:50:54,650
uh,

6043
02:50:54,650 --> 02:50:58,990
the ability to translate into those
websites and exchange information and kind

6044
02:50:58,991 --> 02:51:00,810
of understand that were
absolutely revolutionary.

6045
02:51:00,850 --> 02:51:01,361
No question.

6046
02:51:01,361 --> 02:51:05,170
We're not much different than anyone
anywhere else other than the environment,

6047
02:51:05,171 --> 02:51:05,621
culture,

6048
02:51:05,621 --> 02:51:06,251
all that other stuff.

6049
02:51:06,251 --> 02:51:07,420
But people want the same thing.

6050
02:51:07,450 --> 02:51:08,051
They want to be happy,

6051
02:51:08,051 --> 02:51:10,510
they want to be healthy and they want
to know why the fuck they were in a war,

6052
02:51:11,230 --> 02:51:11,580
you know?

6053
02:51:11,580 --> 02:51:12,980
And maybe maybe some little,

6054
02:51:12,990 --> 02:51:13,290
sure.

6055
02:51:13,290 --> 02:51:13,460
Yeah.

6056
02:51:13,460 --> 02:51:14,530
Some of them do it better answer.

6057
02:51:14,590 --> 02:51:16,240
A lot of them do the ones who are going,

6058
02:51:16,241 --> 02:51:17,070
yeah,

6059
02:51:17,070 --> 02:51:17,390
I'm,

6060
02:51:17,390 --> 02:51:20,050
I'm a little bit more a
positive than you are.

6061
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:20,890
Less cynical maybe.

6062
02:51:20,890 --> 02:51:24,730
I think a technological
innovation is our savior.

6063
02:51:24,790 --> 02:51:25,330
That's what I really

6064
02:51:25,330 --> 02:51:25,990
could be,

6065
02:51:25,990 --> 02:51:26,411
could be.

6066
02:51:26,411 --> 02:51:27,310
I could see it.

6067
02:51:27,311 --> 02:51:27,580
I paid,

6068
02:51:27,580 --> 02:51:28,630
the variables are there.

6069
02:51:28,840 --> 02:51:31,600
I just see so many more on one
side of the ledger than the other.

6070
02:51:31,700 --> 02:51:32,091
I do.

6071
02:51:32,091 --> 02:51:35,480
But I also see culturally so much more
on the technological side of the ledger.

6072
02:51:35,481 --> 02:51:37,700
The fact that the Internet has provided

6073
02:51:37,730 --> 02:51:38,563
this open,

6074
02:51:39,500 --> 02:51:44,500
just this open platform that didn't
exist before and much like a printed type

6075
02:51:46,971 --> 02:51:47,804
much like,

6076
02:51:48,450 --> 02:51:49,090
um,

6077
02:51:49,090 --> 02:51:51,140
the television radio.

6078
02:51:51,380 --> 02:51:51,700
There's,

6079
02:51:51,700 --> 02:51:53,060
this is the new burst.

6080
02:51:53,061 --> 02:51:53,894
This is the new,

6081
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:54,661
I hope you're right.

6082
02:51:54,661 --> 02:51:54,901
Listen,

6083
02:51:54,901 --> 02:51:55,621
I'm all on board.

6084
02:51:55,621 --> 02:51:57,660
I'd like to be more positive
and it really would.

6085
02:51:58,540 --> 02:51:59,373
Hmm.

6086
02:51:59,560 --> 02:51:59,801
Sorry.

6087
02:51:59,801 --> 02:52:01,000
I'd like you to be more positive to him.

6088
02:52:01,001 --> 02:52:01,760
He scared the shit out of him.

6089
02:52:01,760 --> 02:52:02,500
Okay.

6090
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:03,120
That's my,

6091
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:04,570
that's kind of look that nice job.

6092
02:52:04,571 --> 02:52:06,670
This was a fascinating podcast.

6093
02:52:06,671 --> 02:52:07,930
We could do this for like a hundred hours,

6094
02:52:08,060 --> 02:52:09,600
but I had a good time myself.

6095
02:52:09,640 --> 02:52:11,680
Thank you for having me any time.

6096
02:52:11,681 --> 02:52:12,970
If you ever want to come back please.

6097
02:52:12,971 --> 02:52:14,410
If you have anything you
ever want to promote,

6098
02:52:14,411 --> 02:52:15,244
please let me know.

6099
02:52:15,640 --> 02:52:18,130
Tour the studio was worth
the price of admission,

6100
02:52:18,131 --> 02:52:18,420
man.

6101
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:19,660
A beautiful conversation.

6102
02:52:19,661 --> 02:52:20,021
I really,

6103
02:52:20,021 --> 02:52:20,651
really appreciate it.

6104
02:52:20,651 --> 02:52:21,484
Thanks very much.

6105
02:52:21,550 --> 02:52:22,090
And uh,

6106
02:52:22,090 --> 02:52:24,010
you can follow Dan on Twitter.

6107
02:52:24,011 --> 02:52:26,730
It's DC common sense and you all,

6108
02:52:26,770 --> 02:52:27,950
