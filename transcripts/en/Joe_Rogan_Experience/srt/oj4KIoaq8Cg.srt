00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,600
I mean,

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,490
obviously the Western world
has plenty of problems,

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,260
but one thing the western world has
pretty clearly is the even exchange of

5
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,340
information and ideas.

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,790
You might not agree with these ideas
and you might meet and then that's it.

7
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,080
There's a problem with that as well.

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:16,800
But,

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,760
but you have access to them,

10
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:18,660
you have access to them.

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,370
And this access is like,

12
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:20,540
well,

13
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,380
that's one of the things
that's going on with Twitter.

14
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,120
And I don't know if you know about this,

15
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,380
but Milo Yiannopoulos,

16
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:26,214
you know what he is?

17
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,210
He got banned from Twitter for writing
a bad review about Ghostbusters,

18
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,070
which essentially confirms what he
said about the regressive left is that

19
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:38,790
they're trying to stifle ideas like
w and then they're saying that he's

20
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,490
responsible for the
harassment of Leslie Jones.

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:42,990
Right.

22
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,520
Which is horrible.

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,660
You know what people did?

24
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:46,980
She's a fucking comedian.

25
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,420
She's awesome.

26
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:47,821
Great.

27
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:48,421
She's great.

28
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:49,440
She's funny shit,

29
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:50,274
man.

30
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:50,970
Um,

31
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,370
but also this is just trolls.

32
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,701
All right.

33
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:54,630
You're always going to have trolls.

34
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:55,620
But he didn't do that.

35
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,300
He didn't,

36
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,080
he's not responsible for,

37
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,190
he didn't like sin.

38
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,780
He wasn't the catalyst to the,

39
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:01,140
yeah,

40
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,140
but what he did was make an incredible
amount of sense when he was describing

41
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:08,730
that you cannot make fun of this movie.

42
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,370
You cannot criticize this movie if you do,

43
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,520
you're labeled a massage.

44
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,550
And he talked about how preposterous this
movie is that these women are all out

45
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:17,820
kicking ass and every man,

46
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:21,060
the movie's a buffoon and the women don't
have any negative traits or qualities

47
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:21,890
at all.

48
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,321
They're there.

49
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:24,720
They're super powerful and
super awesome and hilarious.

50
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:25,050
And the,

51
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,010
the humor is nonexistent because they
put them in this restrictive box.

52
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,810
He got banned from Twitter for that band,

53
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:31,141
for Twitter,

54
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,640
for this you what they are.

55
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,230
They're blaming him on the harassment
that Leslie experience inside of the

56
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,090
inside anything.

57
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,200
He made a provocative article about a
piece of art and that's what that movie is

58
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:45,211
a piece of art.

59
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:45,750
So they are,

60
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,790
they are guilty of censorship in the,

61
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:48,624
in the worst way.

62
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:48,931
Well,

63
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:52,680
what they're doing is they're stifling
ideas they don't agree with and they've,

64
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,740
they've decided that Twitter establish
some weird fucking thing called the trust

65
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,810
and Security Council
or something like that.

66
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,690
And they brought all these
social dressed justice worse.

67
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,800
Jamie looked that up.

68
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,020
What the fuck is that call
that they tried to do?

69
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,330
But they brought on all
these people for this.

70
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:09,600
I was like,

71
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,440
Mao's China,

72
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,940
but Jesus Christ,

73
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:12,420
very,

74
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,030
very bizarre troll.

75
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,350
It is thought patrol.

76
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:15,990
Well,

77
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,321
look,

78
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm against harassment.

79
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:20,940
If you could stop people from
being shitty to people and you say,

80
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:21,151
well,

81
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:24,870
here's someone who's using Twitter and
they're going after people in a very

82
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:25,290
shitty way.

83
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,290
But the problem with that is look at how
many fucking people have made shitty,

84
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,220
horrible,

85
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,010
evil comments about police officers,

86
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,540
all police officers,

87
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,280
trust and safety council.

88
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,630
When it comes to safety,

89
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,980
everyone plays a role.

90
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,780
Please make that larger so I can read it.

91
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,580
Which one are your powers?

92
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,060
Twitter empowers every
voice to shape the world,

93
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,410
but you can't do that unless you feel
safe and confident enough to express

94
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:57,060
yourself freely and connect with the
world around you to help give your voice

95
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:57,900
more power.

96
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,480
Twitter does not behavior
intended to harass,

97
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,463
intimidate,

98
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,350
or use fear to silence
another user's voice.

99
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,041
Very general,

100
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:06,874
by the way.

101
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,920
So now you have a council that is deciding
whether or not you're good enough for

102
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,120
Twitter as well.

103
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,650
You know what the first
thing they did with him,

104
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,940
they couldn't figure
out what to do with him.

105
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,070
They took away his verification.

106
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,110
Wow.

107
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,351
What?

108
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:19,581
What?

109
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:20,470
What does that have to do with,

110
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:20,800
wow,

111
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,520
what does that,

112
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,870
he's not verified anymore.

113
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,220
They took away a little blue chat.

114
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:24,580
Yeah,

115
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,570
it's very dangerous.

116
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,920
It's a very dangerous,

117
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,110
slippery slope.

118
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,650
But we see the scenario universities,

119
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,930
you do exactly the same thing.

120
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,070
When they did that,

121
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,780
he gained 20,000 new followers immediately
because there was a massive backlash.

122
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,210
So now they're in a place where
there is even more backlash.

123
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:45,211
Cause if you look at the actual words
that he typed versus what they're accusing

124
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:47,410
him of and it just doesn't stack up,

125
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,620
it's clear that they don't like
him because he's a Republican.

126
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,030
He's a Trump supporter.

127
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,490
He and he is a fucking troll.

128
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,210
I love him.

129
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,170
I think he's hilarious.

130
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,033
He's a troll.

131
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,590
But in the marketplace of ideas,

132
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,060
you should be able to combat
his trolling behavior,

133
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,120
gag without gagging,

134
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,800
gagging and engage him,

135
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:09,850
engage him.

136
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,490
In a debate and a vigorous spirit.

137
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,343
Exactly.

138
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,860
Gag The guy.

139
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,190
Right.

140
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,190
If you really feel like he
has done something egregious,

141
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,020
if he's done something
that can be criticized,

142
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,800
criticized it.

143
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,340
That's right.

144
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,620
And if he's actually harassing people,

145
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,720
if he's actually saying,

146
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:26,260
Hey,

147
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,670
go find Leslie Jones and,

148
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:30,190
and throw dog shit out,

149
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,310
or do something horrible to her or
slash your tires or something like that,

150
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,600
he's actually doing something like that.

151
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,543
Yeah.

152
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,341
Then you know,

153
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,390
then he's doing this.

154
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,680
That's where that you don't get up in
a crowded movie theater and scream fire

155
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,900
because you'll create a stampede.

156
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:43,070
Yeah.

157
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,330
Right.

158
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:43,811
Exactly.

159
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:47,770
You know my Angela talked about that when
she said where the Ku Ku Klux Klan was

160
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:48,101
saying,

161
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,270
we have a freedom of speech,

162
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:50,260
and my Angela said,

163
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,150
you're a freedom ends.

164
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:55,420
Your freedom of speech can end when
you're literally telling people to hang me

165
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,770
and you're telling a mob and I'm standing
right there that the inciting them,

166
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:00,100
that's,

167
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,960
that's probably where you know,

168
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:04,570
we should take a look at
things and we all know,

169
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,340
we all know the line.

170
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,230
We don't know about what,

171
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,381
no,

172
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:08,801
I'm saying,

173
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:12,900
I'm saying that that there is something
called common decency and you know,

174
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,590
people like to jump to these extremes,

175
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:15,100
but it's not,

176
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,510
it doesn't inform the debate.

177
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,700
I think what you're
saying is so important.

178
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:22,660
And then the idea that you've got to
create safe haven for those that you agree

179
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,250
with and disagree with.

180
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,530
Disagree with Milo all the time.

181
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:26,890
Yeah.

182
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,550
I mean he and I are friends and I've
had him on the podcast twice and when we

183
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:30,950
talk,

184
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,770
I'm mock them when we have fun.

185
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,370
I mean,

186
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,390
but he's a good guy,

187
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,370
but he's just really right wing.

188
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,080
I also think his trolling is so fucking
sophisticated and he's one of the ones

189
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,960
that was saying that he
believes that Melania,

190
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:44,794
how do you say her name?

191
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,580
Trump.

192
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:45,971
Melania.

193
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,540
Is that her name?

194
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,020
Yeah,

195
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,910
he thinks that they did it on purpose.

196
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,930
He thinks Trump is a master troll and
he thinks that the plagiarism was on

197
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:56,710
purpose because now more people are
talking about it and then more people are,

198
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,940
I don't know if that's true,

199
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,890
but I think it's hilarious that
you did you know that his tweet,

200
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,490
Trump's tweet that he put
out to congratulate his
wife for speaking is exactly

201
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,080
verbatim the same tweet that Obama
put out to congratulate his wife for

202
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:19,290
speaking.

203
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:19,940
Interesting.

204
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,990
Exactly.

205
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,420
Every single word in the exact same order.

206
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,230
Wow.

207
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:27,830
Yes.

208
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,961
Oh,

209
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:29,390
that's pretty calculated.

210
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,553
I don't know.

211
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
I don't think he writes his own tweets.

212
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,220
That apparently wasn't true.

213
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,010
Is it fake like that
was like photoshopped.

214
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,300
Oh,

215
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,520
this fuckers they got me.

216
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,660
That was the other thing they did.

217
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,830
I'm sorry about that folks.

218
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,860
That's another thing that they
did with the Leslie Jones,

219
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,940
which she was really upset,

220
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,970
is that trolls were taking words and
putting them like they were taking a

221
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,950
Photoshop and making her like her name,

222
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:55,490
like what she had heard her Twitter name
and then writing horrible shit about

223
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,650
gay people and then putting it in there.

224
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,520
Jesus.

225
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,860
But Leslie Jones and again,

226
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,580
I love her.

227
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,420
I think she's really funny.

228
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,350
She said some kind of fucked up things on,

229
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,810
on Twitter herself and you know,

230
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:10,580
things that can be construed as racist.

231
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,930
One of the things she said like about
white people being shit fuck white people.

232
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:15,351
Shit.

233
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,190
Like something like that.

234
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,870
It was a on on Breitbart.

235
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:18,500
See if you could,

236
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,790
you'd find the actual,

237
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,180
uh,

238
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,991
things that they were,

239
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,160
there were saying that like,

240
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:24,620
how could Leslie Jones
get away with saying this?

241
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,100
But Milo gets banned for writing
an article and I'm not you ma'am.

242
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,840
But I think what Leslie said,

243
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:33,471
like white people,

244
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,304
Shit,

245
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,980
it could've been that she was saying like,

246
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,620
someone did something
and Goddamn white people,

247
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,670
this is some white people.

248
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:41,050
Shit.

249
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,300
Yeah.

250
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:41,511
You know,

251
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:41,870
like,

252
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,590
she's funny.

253
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,250
Like when people climb into a zoo
and try to fucking hug a tiger,

254
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,173
that's why people,

255
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,430
that's why people shit.

256
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,263
That's funny though.

257
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,580
And Laissez anybody who
knows me knows she's great.

258
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,700
She's just that fucking Dall
Lord have mercy white people.

259
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:56,150
Shit.

260
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,380
What does that mean though?

261
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,670
It's white people shit.

262
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,840
They crazy style.

263
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,231
I mean,

264
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,160
what does that mean?

265
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,630
Like why did she say that?

266
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:05,200
Like what does that about
who imagine a white person,

267
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:05,870
but look at this,

268
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,660
imagine a white person saying
that about black people.

269
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,381
I understand,

270
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:10,370
but I think I,

271
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:10,641
you know,

272
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:12,020
we've heard this before and we,

273
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,520
it's fine.

274
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,040
Leslie Jones is not a
racist and Leslie Jones's,

275
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,680
it never been anything but
really kind to people around her.

276
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,981
Okay.

277
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:22,160
But hold on a second because sometimes
people say things that are racist and

278
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,060
they're not racist.

279
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:23,960
They're just trying to be funny.

280
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:24,560
Yes.

281
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,311
Like you know,

282
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:27,150
I mean Hawaii 2 cents and if sometimes it,

283
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:31,420
Jeff Ross is hilarious and he says a
lot of racial stuff when he deserves

284
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:32,070
Silberman Bowl,

285
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,903
Sarah Silverman.

286
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,430
But if Jeff Ross in particular,

287
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,460
because he's really good at
roasting people and a lot
of the stuff that he says,

288
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:37,940
like,

289
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,150
you know,

290
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,670
he crosses what some
people would say is a line,

291
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:41,871
but what is he doing?

292
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:42,620
He's being funny.

293
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,490
There is,

294
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,440
there is a difference.

295
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,050
So a lot of times if you're Hispanic,

296
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,560
um,

297
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,393
if you're,

298
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,030
you know,

299
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,410
you're from a marginalized group,

300
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,910
you can get away with it because you,

301
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:59,090
you all share in a common
experience of repression.

302
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,310
Right?

303
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,420
So like gay people can
mock straight people guide,

304
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:03,841
go ahead.

305
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:04,960
Mock me for liking Posey.

306
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,550
Who Cares?

307
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,260
That's what I mean.

308
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,871
Cause we don't,

309
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,780
we've never had to pay a price
for that kind of oppression.

310
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,590
We haven't,

311
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,210
not physically and not,

312
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:16,380
not economically issue because we've been
oppressed for being straight forever.

313
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,510
It's a constant thing.

314
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,200
People were just so mad that we're
saying breeder fucking breeder,

315
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,670
they're making babies.

316
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:33,810
Okay.
