00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,770
Everyone knows that the two
party system is kind of stupid,

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,630
but everyone seems to think that any other
party other than the two party system

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,700
is unrealistic or any other party,

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,940
like a Libertarian Green party
somewhere along anything independent is

6
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:16,774
unrealistic.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,530
Well,

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:17,881
I'm,

9
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:22,881
I'm back to right now 50% of all people
that are registering to vote or are

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,130
registering is independent.

11
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,151
Statistically,

12
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:26,541
right now,

13
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:29,540
43% of America is independent,

14
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,580
but new registrations,

15
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:32,480
50%.

16
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:33,530
So I don't,

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,101
uh,

18
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:34,940
I don't know as the,

19
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,640
as people do identify
with the two parties,

20
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:39,670
the rigged game of the system is,

21
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:41,960
is that we're only
presented with two choices.

22
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:44,990
And that really starts with
just being in the polls.

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,430
Look right now,

24
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,720
if Mickey Mouse,

25
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:49,790
where the third name in any poll,

26
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:54,791
Mickey would be pulling it
30% but Mickey's not on the
ballot in all 50 states.

27
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,810
And if I'm the libertarian nominee and I
hope to be the libertarian nominee that

28
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,610
happens next weekend,

29
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,580
um,

30
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,860
I'm going to be the only other candidate
on the ballot in all 50 states.

31
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,810
So polling,

32
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,440
I,

33
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,480
I just want to be in the polls.

34
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,780
There is no way a third party wins
without being in the presidential debates.

35
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:18,700
That's just not going to happen.

36
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,160
A Superbowl of politics to get
in the presidential debates,

37
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:24,590
you have to be at 15% in the polls,

38
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:24,921
Joe.

39
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,240
The rig game is,

40
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:28,640
is that if you're not in the polls,

41
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,700
there's no way that you can pull at 15%,

42
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,590
but it has to be a consistent polling.

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,033
Um,

44
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,750
starting now,

45
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,520
I was in the first national poll
that I've been in a month ago.

46
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,620
I haven't been in a national poll since,

47
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:45,430
but in a month,

48
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,211
a month ago,

49
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:49,300
I was at 11% against Hillary and Trump.

50
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,670
And was this all established back when
Ross Perot sort of shook up the political

51
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:59,110
establishment because that there was a
lower percentage required to get involved

52
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:01,330
in debates before that actually sent?

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:01,871
Well,

54
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:05,800
actually there was no percentage
points prior to Ross Perot.

55
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,410
That was something that got
established after Ross Perot.

56
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:09,220
And what,

57
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,220
what is amazing to me is Ross Perot
after having gotten 19% of the general

58
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:17,620
election vote the first time.

59
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,600
The second time he ran,

60
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,630
they did not allow him in
the presidential debates,

61
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:23,464
which is just,

62
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,160
I mean,

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,080
that's the rigged nature of the game.

64
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:27,640
The rig nature of the game is,

65
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:28,780
is come this fall.

66
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,140
If my name does not appear
in another single pole,

67
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,120
the presidential debate commission,

68
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,920
we'll say a Gary Johnson.

69
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:37,690
He just didn't pull high enough.

70
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,641
What they've,

71
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:42,400
what they won't say is that he wasn't
in the polls and the commission for

72
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:45,130
presidential debates is a
privately funded institution.

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,060
Private Democrats and Republicans were
suing the presidential debate commission.

74
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:49,631
Also,

75
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:52,030
we think that it's a antitrust,

76
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:52,751
we think that,

77
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:53,560
uh,

78
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,510
not think it's Democrats and Republicans
and they collude with one another to

79
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,040
exclude else.

80
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,640
Bruce Fein is suing the
presidential debate commission.

81
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,660
Bruce finds claim to fame is that
he brought Nixon down in Watergate,

82
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,250
but in the next sentence,

83
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:12,520
he will tell you that the biggest thing
he's ever done in his life is suing the

84
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:16,180
presidential debate commission because
this has the opportunity of changing

85
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:17,320
politics in America.

86
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:17,531
I mean,

87
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,930
this is really at the
heart of this rig game.

88
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,600
You can't win the presidency if you're
not in the super bowl of politics.

89
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:25,901
We've,

90
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:29,800
we figured the dollar value alone of
being in the presidential debates is

91
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:31,720
several hundred million dollars.

92
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,220
Just think of the Super Bowl and the
ads that sell during the super bowl.

93
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:38,250
And imagine being a,

94
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,200
having second biggest audience.

95
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:44,080
You don't have like 75 million people for,

96
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:44,470
you know,

97
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,221
90 minutes,

98
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:46,054
two hours.

99
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,500
That's a couple of hundred million
dollars worth of advertising.

100
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,401
Yeah.

101
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:51,660
That is the show.

102
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,040
And if you're not in the show,

103
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,510
people don't consider your vote.

104
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,920
Like they think of,

105
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,800
even if you have 50% of these people
that are registering and saying they're

106
00:03:58,801 --> 00:03:59,580
independent,

107
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,920
what they're really saying is they're
not committing to a left or a right.

108
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:04,020
They're not committing to
a democratic or Republican,

109
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:06,060
but are they gonna vote independent?

110
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,560
That's a lot of people.

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,230
They have this idea that
if you vote independent,

112
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:11,640
you're throwing away your vote.

113
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,180
That's,

114
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,980
that is a stigma that has to be overcome.

115
00:04:13,981 --> 00:04:14,340
Right?

116
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,531
No,

117
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:14,600
no,

118
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:14,800
no.

119
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:14,981
I,

120
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:15,990
I agree,

121
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:16,800
but,

122
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,330
but for those people that they do vote
right and they end up voting on the basis

123
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:22,830
of the lesser of two evils.

124
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:26,790
But since they're registering to vote
and they're registering to vote as

125
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:27,690
independent,

126
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,520
they end up at the polls.

127
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:29,851
I mean,

128
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:30,684
for the most part,

129
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,230
most,

130
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,670
most people don't even go to the poll.

131
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,930
Most people don't even vote.

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,041
Yeah,

133
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:35,191
it's,

134
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,024
it's,

135
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
is there a way to fix it?

136
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:40,570
Do you think that there's a way to maybe
somehow or another allow people to vote

137
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,880
online and change the way it's set up?

138
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:43,151
Now?

139
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:45,100
We don't have to physically
go to a location.

140
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:49,110
You don't have to sign
up physically in a place.

141
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:52,600
So you can actually just do it from
your computer the same way we bank.

142
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,630
That has to be the future.

143
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,110
Um,

144
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,910
that does not exist now,

145
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,590
but that has to be the future.

146
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,200
And from a legislative standpoint,

147
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:02,740
meaning,

148
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,101
okay,

149
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:06,760
you're president of the United
States or governor of New Mexico,

150
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,650
you could sign legislation that,

151
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,300
um,

152
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:09,460
and,

153
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,590
and these are the things
that are going to happen.

154
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,540
It's going to be easier
and easier to vote.

155
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,490
And that's what should be the case.

156
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,890
Be the case if the system
isn't totally Rick.

157
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:20,710
Cause the problem is people like Hillary,

158
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,010
um,

159
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,100
the people that are
longtime establish them,

160
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,660
people that have been a
part of politics forever,

161
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,170
the last thing they want to do is turn
over the reins to the Internet because

162
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,900
she's had what did what,

163
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,660
how much they send.

164
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,530
They say they're spending spending over
a million dollars just to combat online

165
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:39,520
trolls just to go on reddit
and forums and correct people.

166
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,150
Yes.

167
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,630
And I would,

168
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,910
I would be surprised if
the number was that low.

169
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,390
Yeah.

170
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,380
I would be surprised too.

171
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:44,890
Yeah.

172
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,371
I think,

173
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:45,570
uh,

174
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,440
they're probably being pretty
conservative about that.

175
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:52,441
But the idea is that the internet
doesn't like the establishment.

176
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,670
They know that there's a
real problem with the system,

177
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,440
the system in place as is.

178
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,261
And the Internet,

179
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:58,350
when I say the Internet and of the,

180
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:03,170
the broad stroke that you're painting is
obviously young people who are a little

181
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:08,171
bit more aware of how screwy this whole
system that they're sort of born into

182
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:08,810
is.

183
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,390
And that the people that are
in charge don't want change.

184
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,950
They want to keep it at two party system.

185
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,960
They want to keep this silly white hat,

186
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:15,620
black hat,

187
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,760
goofy game going on forever
and keep control of the power

188
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,590
right on.

189
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,490
And this,

190
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,790
but this cycle for the
first time in my lifetime,

191
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,830
this might change.

192
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,580
I mean this because of just how
polarizing the two of them are.

193
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:31,960
Yeah,

194
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,310
and I think Bernie Sanders is what a lot
of people think of as the alternative

195
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:36,701
right now.

196
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:37,930
Mainstream alternative.

197
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,660
He stands pretty far out
there from the other guys.

198
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,980
So have you seen the
website I side with.com no,

199
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:44,290
I haven't.

200
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,090
You gotta write it down.

201
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,810
You've got to take,

202
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,960
take this political quiz I
side and everybody listening
take this political quiz

203
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,530
I side with.com it's about 60 questions.

204
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:54,820
It's really easy.

205
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:55,570
You don't have to,

206
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,051
you know know you.

207
00:06:56,051 --> 00:06:58,060
You don't have to sign up on the website,

208
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:01,270
but you take this quiz and at the end
of the quiz you get paired up with a

209
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:04,090
presidential candidate most
in line with your views.

210
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,530
It just makes real sense.

211
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,910
I think everybody should take the
quiz and whoever you line up with,

212
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,330
um,

213
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,030
I think you should knock yourself
out supporting that person.

214
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:13,811
Well,

215
00:07:13,811 --> 00:07:14,351
for me,

216
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,300
taking the I side with quiz,

217
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,230
amazingly,

218
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:20,980
the next politician that I aligned with
outside of the libertarians that are

219
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:23,290
running for president is Bernie Sanders.

220
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,220
Um,

221
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,280
I aligned with Bernie
Sanders 73% of what he says.

222
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,431
Now,

223
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,690
when it comes to economics,

224
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:30,310
we come to a t in the road,

225
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,131
uh,

226
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:33,370
when it comes to the socialism versus,

227
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,850
um,

228
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,241
you know,

229
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:39,100
being an entrepreneur when it comes to
big government versus small government,

230
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:40,660
we come to that t in the road.

231
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:40,991
But,

232
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:41,740
uh,

233
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,320
on the issues of legalizing marijuana,

234
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:45,670
same sex marriage,

235
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:47,050
a woman's right to choose,

236
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:47,884
hey,

237
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,830
let's stop with these
military interventions.

238
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,700
This is just,

239
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,870
this is just crazy.

240
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,160
We're in line.

241
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,533
So,

242
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,360
um,

243
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,890
I,

244
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,080
I pushed this website because,

245
00:07:59,081 --> 00:07:59,560
um,

246
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,300
it should work the other way around.

247
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:01,661
Okay.

248
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:03,580
I side with Bernie most of the time,

249
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:05,200
but oh my gosh,

250
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,180
the libertarian candidate,

251
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:07,961
Gary Johnson,

252
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:09,610
I side with next in line.

253
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,620
And I do believe that,

254
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:12,310
um,

255
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,320
Bernie is not going to get the nomination.

256
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,060
I don't think that's going to happen.

257
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:17,770
And where do all those voters go?

258
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,490
Where does 50% of Republicans go that
really are at the end of the day and was

259
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,730
socially tolerant and
fiscally conservative.

260
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,970
And I think that is the
majority of Republican voters,

261
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:31,450
but a,

262
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:36,450
they'd been co opted by the social
conservatives that have an agenda that I

263
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:40,030
think is really a turnoff
to most of America.

264
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,160
And it's okay to be a social conservative.

265
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:44,110
There's nothing wrong with
being a social conservative,

266
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:44,944
but if you,

267
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,080
if you equate,

268
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,640
if you make that public policy,

269
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:51,880
if you pass laws regarding
social conservatism,

270
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:54,820
you end up putting people in
jail for personal choices.

271
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:59,460
And we do have the highest incarceration
rate of any country in the world.

272
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,290
And I think that starts with the drug war.

273
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,210
The word conservative is interesting too,

274
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:06,360
when you apply it to social issues
like social conservativism cause

275
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:10,470
conservatives really want the original
conservatives were stay out of my

276
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:10,891
business.

277
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:11,910
I'll stay out of yours.

278
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:17,090
So social conservative really wouldn't
apply to like things along the lines of

279
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:20,720
gay marriage or same sex
unions or anything along those.

280
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,061
You would,

281
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:21,451
you'd say,

282
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:22,710
we'll leave those people alone.

283
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:24,390
That would be the conservative approach.

284
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:26,850
The government should stay
out of those people's lives.

285
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:27,240
Right.

286
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,073
Well,

287
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,540
it started out as classical liberal,

288
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,010
classical liberal is being fiscally
conservative and socially liberal,

289
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:36,750
which got co-opted.

290
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,201
I mean,

291
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:37,490
that,

292
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,270
that used to be what a
conservative was co opted.

293
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,671
And,

294
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:42,504
um,

295
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,391
like I said,

296
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:44,940
I think we're a little bit of both.

297
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,110
You,

298
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,630
you've heard the old adage that if
in college you weren't a Democrat,

299
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,770
you didn't have a heart,

300
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,450
and if a,

301
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:52,440
as an adult,

302
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,550
you weren't a Republican,

303
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,660
you didn't have a brain.

304
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:55,494
Well,

305
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,060
I think we've got both.

306
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,100
All of us have gotten
both of those things.

307
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,610
Yeah.

308
00:09:59,610 --> 00:09:59,900
It's,

309
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,640
it's just real polarizing
to have only two choices.

310
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:02,821
Well,

311
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:03,280
and it's,

312
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,070
and it's so polarizing because the,

313
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,120
those issues,

314
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,810
um,

315
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,171
at the,

316
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,550
at the end of the day,

317
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,443
um,

318
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,520
why can't Democrats and Republicans
come together on some very common sense

319
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:16,950
issues that would move
the country forward.

320
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,110
Okay.
