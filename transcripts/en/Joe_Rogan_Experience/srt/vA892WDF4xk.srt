1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:00,910
Doot,

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:01,171
doot,

3
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:01,471
doot,

4
00:00:01,471 --> 00:00:01,850
doot.

5
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,210
That clock at all.

6
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,703
Stope right.

7
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,400
We're live.

8
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:05,990
We're back.

9
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,823
Part two folks.

10
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,710
If you hated part one,

11
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,610
this one's going to be worse.

12
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,661
Worse,

13
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:10,494
worse.

14
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,860
Oh fucking hate to show.

15
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,920
You know what my favorite is when
people go fucking shows change man.

16
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,650
You used to used to fucking
be more open minded.

17
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,280
Yeah.

18
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,960
People Change.

19
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,890
Do you want me to do man,

20
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,730
I changed.

21
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,870
I changed over five years.

22
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,860
Everyone change.

23
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,530
I'm not into fucking
Lego's and video games,

24
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:28,711
man.

25
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:29,544
I grew up.

26
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,560
I definitely don't think
I'm less open minded though.

27
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,080
I'm definitely less tolerant
for stupid shit though.

28
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,510
I just think I've heard
it too many times now.

29
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:37,170
I'm like,

30
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,250
stop,

31
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,880
stop.

32
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,860
It's not doing anybody any good stock.

33
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,360
He cut out the bullshit.

34
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,480
Well I cut out like conspiracy
bullshit and religious bullshit.

35
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:46,314
It's like,

36
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,440
and it doesn't mean that I,

37
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,740
I dunno,

38
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,230
I'm not willing to consider
people's points of view,

39
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:55,760
but certain certain things just at
a certain point in time like keep,

40
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,730
can't keep refreshing them
shimmy over and over again.

41
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,860
You know when it gets a
certain point in time,

42
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,540
like for instance,

43
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,030
like,

44
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,960
like Ufos.

45
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,501
Do?

46
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,060
I think the UFOS are real.

47
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,140
It's totally possible if we can
put a satellite around the earth,

48
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,570
it's very possible at some
advanced life form consent.

49
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,330
The spaceship here from another galaxy.

50
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,570
Have I seen anything that makes me
believe that it's actually helped?

51
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:22,050
Proof?

52
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,800
No.

53
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,380
So when you don't share that opinion,

54
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,010
when you're absolutely convinced that the
government is hiding details and like,

55
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,730
okay,

56
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,700
what makes you really
want to believe this?

57
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:35,490
Because you're not saying this
based on some hardcore shit.

58
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,790
Like I know that if you take this
plastic and you put it over fire,

59
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,270
oops,

60
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,103
did I fuck that up?

61
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,610
If we take this plastic,

62
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:42,444
how did I do that?

63
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,343
Exit.

64
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:44,880
Take this plastic.

65
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,031
Oh,

66
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:45,721
what the fuck?

67
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:46,554
You can't

68
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:48,890
watch it now.

69
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,733
Jesus Christ.

70
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,230
If you take this plastic
and put it over fire,

71
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,000
right?

72
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,460
What are they doing?

73
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,450
They're playing this again.

74
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,670
What are they doing here?

75
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,650
I didn't start this from the beginning.

76
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,120
Did I know that's a filler for rain?

77
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,430
They're showing this fight again.

78
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:03,540
The old filler fight.

79
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:03,751
Well,

80
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:04,584
we watched all,

81
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,790
we already watched his fight.

82
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,560
Do we watch on the video?

83
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,641
Was this on the,

84
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:09,090
um,

85
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,320
the prelims for the,

86
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:11,154
um,

87
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,800
was it,

88
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,633
okay.

89
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,260
So I guess we watched this again.

90
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,950
Can you do,

91
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,783
maybe I'm wrong.

92
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,950
Is this a tournament?

93
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,581
It's not a toy.

94
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:20,821
It is.

95
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:21,601
It is a tournament.

96
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:22,470
A heavyweight tournament.

97
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:22,741
Oh,

98
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:23,311
that's right.

99
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,420
So this guy one early,

100
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,930
he's the number one
ranked heads shaking shit.

101
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:28,764
Look at that little dance.

102
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,031
Oh,

103
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:29,431
look at him.

104
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:30,060
Go.

105
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,571
Oh Damn.

106
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:30,950
Look at him.

107
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,741
He's feeling good.

108
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:32,530
He's feeling it.

109
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,660
Look at his training in the back.

110
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,350
Awkward.

111
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,183
Awkward.

112
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,151
One of what?

113
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:36,541
Music.

114
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,240
He's dancing too because
white people in me.

115
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,170
Guess let me guess how bad the song is.

116
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,520
Probably the worst song ever.

117
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:42,840
Let's hear what song is it?

118
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,343
Awesome.

119
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,760
I want to hear the song I hear quadros

120
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,850
sounds like some Rick Ross.

121
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:53,963
Really?

122
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,040
Some people want to believe

123
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,873
it is.

124
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,181
By the way.

125
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,880
I want to call me Quadro skeletor.

126
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,090
I was just choking.

127
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,040
He does look like him though a little bit,

128
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,180
but call a spade a spade.

129
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,043
I'm a Oh hi.

130
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,250
I got goofy.

131
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,671
I'm not,

132
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:11,230
but he does look like skeletor.

133
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,370
He's very knowledgeable though.

134
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,960
Knows a lot of shit about kickboxing.

135
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,111
Yeah.

136
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:14,944
Great man.

137
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,900
It's still a fixed kill it or

138
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,233
how dare you.

139
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,303
Oh,

140
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,063
Bravo.

141
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,690
He nasty problems like some
serious beef back in the day.

142
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,450
I want to talk about it.

143
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:28,870
Oh.

144
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,770
Should have been talking about.

145
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,641
I'll tell you afterwards.

146
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,780
Is it legit beef though?

147
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,500
It's horse shit.

148
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,430
It's all stupidity.

149
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,033
Don't let it Eddie.

150
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,990
Oh,

151
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,870
stupidity.

152
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,311
Oh No,

153
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:38,551
no,

154
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:38,761
no,

155
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:38,970
no.

156
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,750
And then not like that and like
not like they come to that.

157
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:42,820
It was like gossip.

158
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,360
Yeah.

159
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,851
I'll tell you that.

160
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:44,561
I'm down for that.

161
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:44,651
Yeah,

162
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:44,981
definitely.

163
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:45,814
Tell me how to do.

164
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,360
Hey,

165
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,380
people change,

166
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,380
people grow and they move on.

167
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,833
Um,

168
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,820
speaking of growing and moving on,

169
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,343
what

170
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,130
segue in between the fight,

171
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:00,380
you,

172
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,001
you a,

173
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:03,320
you might've mentioned something
that you might've wanted it to.

174
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:03,880
Yeah,

175
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,100
I'd rather it come from me first,

176
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:07,780
especially on this platform
then from anyone else.

177
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,740
Uh,

178
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,360
things have just got too crazy man.

179
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:14,530
It's like the perfect storm and
the UFC wanted me to sign the,

180
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,941
you know,

181
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:18,690
the license deal with Reebok and uh,

182
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,560
the,

183
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,010
the random testing,

184
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:21,980
the Vata testing,

185
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,080
where the fuck it is.

186
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,270
And really I was just going
to ride this out and you know,

187
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,920
I wanted to do one more fight,

188
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,580
but with the fighter and the kid
I'll craziest to become and I,

189
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,450
I never thought it'd become this and the
live shows and now we're going on tour

190
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:35,410
and I have this,

191
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,550
this other gig.

192
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:39,970
I got this on a big network that
I can't talk about till it's done.

193
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,840
And um,

194
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,340
the merchandise and all this stuff,

195
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:42,710
it,

196
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,543
it just,

197
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,350
I got to step away from the game,

198
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:45,581
man.

199
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,440
I gotta step away from
the UFC for right now.

200
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,000
You know what I love about fighting?

201
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:49,811
We were talking about this,

202
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:50,680
that you could just say,

203
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,670
I'm going to retire.

204
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,960
And then you could say like in a week
from now I'm unretired and then a week

205
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,550
later you could say retired again.

206
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:58,750
Yeah,

207
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,730
you could go back and forth for sure.

208
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:01,421
But like,

209
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:02,530
thinking about sugar Ray Leonard,

210
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,900
how many times does a coal miner retire?

211
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,260
Usually once she won sugar ray Leonard.

212
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:07,840
No tired.

213
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,320
Like a half a dozen fucking time.

214
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,450
Get it with fighters,

215
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:10,691
man.

216
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:11,710
But for me,

217
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:11,980
you know,

218
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,220
and I,

219
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,000
I talked to my family and close friends
and you were one of them and Callan and

220
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,661
you know,

221
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:17,494
my dad and,

222
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,513
uh,

223
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,241
going through it,

224
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:19,461
man,

225
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:21,400
it just do I want one more?

226
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,570
Fuck yes man.

227
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,404
But it just,

228
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,330
it doesn't make sense.

229
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:25,530
I,

230
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,190
I,

231
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,420
I can't see myself in
it when it comes down.

232
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:28,601
This,

233
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:32,770
I can't see myself in a fucking
Reebok kit walking out to the octagon.

234
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,510
I can't see myself being like,

235
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:35,021
you know what?

236
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:35,854
Cool man.

237
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,680
Yeah,

238
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,570
that's what I'm worth.

239
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,351
I'm worth 10 grand.

240
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:38,741
Do you guys,

241
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:39,461
I'm going to do this,

242
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:40,000
you know,

243
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,530
and I have other opportunities
and everything I have
and people think I'm this

244
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:45,760
hate on the UFC or whatever.

245
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,720
I owe it to the EOC,

246
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:46,891
man.

247
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:48,370
I'll always be indebted to the UFC.

248
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,483
Uh,

249
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,920
people think of the
problem with Dana White.

250
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:51,731
I definitely don't.

251
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,220
If Dana was in trouble and
text me right now and said,

252
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,851
hey shop,

253
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:57,980
I wish you'd quit talking
shit about Reebok or I

254
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,700
need help.

255
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,301
You got it,

256
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,134
man.

257
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,830
Cool.

258
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,420
Done.

259
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:01,580
Uh,

260
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,020
he,

261
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,250
uh,

262
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,500
always be a supportive,

263
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,000
the UCM whatever they need.

264
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,110
But for right now,

265
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,840
I gotta take a step away and focus on,

266
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:09,560
uh,

267
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,060
this crazy fricking entertainment
podcasts career I got going on,

268
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:14,241
man.

269
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,130
I'm so blessed and that you are,

270
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,030
and I think that there's,

271
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,060
there's moments like that where like
necessity becomes the mother of invention,

272
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:27,120
like necessity to figure out another way
to generate income because the hundred

273
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,790
thousand dollars you were
making from sponsorships,

274
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,140
which is 100% real and legit
and certified and authenticated,

275
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,243
proven,

276
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,490
that's a lot of goddamn money you're
missing out on every time you would

277
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:38,240
compete.

278
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,710
And so because of that,

279
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,300
it makes you concentrate and put
even more effort into your podcast,

280
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,143
into your merchant said,

281
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,680
and I look how everything's going.

282
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:45,921
I mean,

283
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:46,131
it's,

284
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:49,160
it's insane how much money you
guys are making and more important.

285
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,220
It's insane how many people you guys
are entertaining and how many people you

286
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:53,054
guys are reaching.

287
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,083
It's insane.

288
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,060
When I did that live show the other night,

289
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:56,871
dude,

290
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:57,950
I thought Callen and never,

291
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,800
and our agent where honey dick in
me like this thing selling out.

292
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,510
And I got on stage with that Mike.

293
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:03,170
I was like,

294
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,740
oh man.

295
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,221
Oh Man,

296
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:05,054
this is what I'm going to.

297
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,923
I love this.

298
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,240
This is insane,

299
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:08,830
man.

300
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,630
And now they want to do this tour
and the the things are selling out.

301
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,190
It'd be tough when we say no,

302
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:13,880
you know what?

303
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,030
Let me go fight some monster
who's been training full time,

304
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:19,700
not telling Dick Jokes and
you know what I'm saying?

305
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,700
And selling fucking big
brown shirts fulltime.

306
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,960
Let me go fight that guy.

307
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,820
I wouldn't do the game a disservice.

308
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:26,510
You know what I'm saying?

309
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,170
I want to do that.

310
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,330
So unless I could focus on it full time,

311
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,090
there's just no way and
signing this Reebok deal,

312
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,140
it's not going to happen,

313
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:33,710
man.

314
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,370
Yeah.

315
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,850
I,

316
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,330
I completely understand
where you're coming from when
I've completely understand

317
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:41,780
the idea that if you're not a
hundred percent focused on fighting,

318
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:43,160
it's just not something you should do.

319
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,050
I've always told people that finding
should be a singular pursuit.

320
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,790
I think it's unlike any other,

321
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,400
any other pursuit where
if you're going to do it,

322
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,570
you have to make sure that all
your eggs are in that one basket.

323
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,820
I really don't think you could
have one foot in the game,

324
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:00,050
one fund a foot out of the game.

325
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:03,020
I think it's real dangerous to do
that with fighting and not be good.

326
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,260
Yeah.

327
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,370
Because you're going to fight some
fucking guy who's all in and those all in

328
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:07,671
those,

329
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:09,740
all in murderers and they're out there.

330
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
Those all in guys,

331
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:11,301
you know,

332
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:15,730
you want it to a rumble Johnson who's
all in 100% man with no other option and

333
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,290
listened to me and people
might beg to differ.

334
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,490
I feel like I've won,

335
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:19,820
man.

336
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,031
I,

337
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:20,331
you know,

338
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:20,800
I have,

339
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,840
I have no brain trauma
that I know of and my,

340
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,400
my body's in good shape.

341
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,810
I have this insane career right now with
podcasts and the live shows and this

342
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,970
other Gig I get going on with
TV and I feel like I've won.

343
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,520
And honestly I owe it to the UFC.

344
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:34,750
Man.

345
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:34,970
I'm it,

346
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,230
I'm indebted to them forever.

347
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:36,620
And,

348
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,250
um,

349
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:37,461
you know,

350
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:40,910
I'll always still watch every fight and
who knows what happened in the future.

351
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:41,780
But for right now,

352
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,510
there's no way they
could off meet anybody.

353
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,403
And there's no way,

354
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,390
there's no way I could put all
this on hold holding be like,

355
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:47,511
yeah,

356
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:48,530
let me go take this flight.

357
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,161
Well,

358
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,520
it would be hard because all this has
been an investment in your time and it's

359
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:53,690
also been paying off.

360
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,330
And it also was growing like
considerably for people don't know,

361
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:58,230
like your numbers.

362
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,790
Like I know where you guys were a year
ago and two years ago and I know where

363
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,624
you are now and it's,

364
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,740
it's this crazy exponential thing where
every month that comes up and up and up

365
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:09,690
and up and up and it's because it's good.

366
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,730
And you guys got a weird dynamic,

367
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:11,941
you know,

368
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:12,360
accounts.

369
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,920
It's a fucking goof ball and,

370
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,731
and you know,

371
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:15,181
it's like,

372
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:18,300
he's like a builtin joke all the time.

373
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:22,800
Like he'll always say something
ridiculous and you two together are funny.

374
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,940
Like it's a funny group.

375
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,960
It's funny grouping.

376
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,820
That's interesting
thing is what I'm doing.

377
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,421
Listen man,

378
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:30,270
my two advisers or Joe
Rogan and Brian Cowen.

379
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,050
What,

380
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,010
what the fuck?

381
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,570
I get the Mount Rushmore.

382
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:34,440
You know what I'm saying?

383
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,860
Guys who have have done shit who are
saying for sure listen to me and not him.

384
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,301
No.

385
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:39,570
I'm assuming right now real quick.

386
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,080
Hey,

387
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,510
that's me being friendly to Callan.

388
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,640
Maybe it'd probably be challenge,

389
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,640
but the thing that will get some fucking
God damn horrible advice could be

390
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:48,870
selling used electronics,

391
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,351
fighting a kid,

392
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:50,550
use electronics class.

393
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,230
Tallon was advising this fucking thing.

394
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,530
You want to open the pawn store?

395
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:54,331
That's a different story.

396
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:54,930
But uh,

397
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,380
what store a pond like,

398
00:09:57,381 --> 00:09:57,530
uh,

399
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:57,800
like,

400
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,080
like,

401
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,913
like,

402
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,050
like a fucking one stars.

403
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:01,710
You know what I'm saying?

404
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:01,861
Oh,

405
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:02,330
pawn.

406
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:02,580
Yeah,

407
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,150
for real.

408
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,840
For Real.

409
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,410
Wait a minute.

410
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,550
This is the one that idea,

411
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,170
I thought you said a pond.

412
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,004
Like he wants to open up.

413
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,050
Okay.

414
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,050
Five kids funds.

415
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,113
That's really,

416
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,920
that's a weird way of looking at things.

417
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,940
Maybe people like ponds you
wanted to sell are going off,

418
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:18,774
dude.

419
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,940
Oh my God,

420
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,110
blessed this fight is fucking crazy.

421
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,500
Um,

422
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,320
um,

423
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,801
but yeah,

424
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:27,330
so long story short,

425
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,680
I'm stepping away from the
game and there's going to
be no shab Reebok kits out

426
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,280
there.

427
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,180
I'm not finding when,

428
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,020
anytime soon.

429
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,910
Did they ever make a shrub Reebok kit?

430
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:38,460
Can I get one like as
like a a collector's item?

431
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,900
I think they did for like a week and
then I came out and just talked all this

432
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:42,361
shit and I'm like,

433
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:42,811
Oh shit,

434
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:43,500
pull that shit down.

435
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,880
Pull that shit down right now.

436
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,170
Did anybody buy one?

437
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:47,460
Do you get any money from those?

438
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,950
I'll probably like 14 cents or some shit.

439
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:50,850
I don't know the deal,

440
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,320
but it sure as fuck.

441
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:53,760
Not as much as selling my own shit.

442
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,001
He,

443
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,050
oh well no,

444
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,610
because then you get all,

445
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:57,380
exactly.

446
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,100
And we just released shirt and I made,

447
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,400
you know,

448
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,380
I'm doing good,

449
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,400
doing good,

450
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,540
everything's Nice.

451
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,580
There's no need to be struggling.

452
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,850
There's no one's struck more
shirts than Reebok kits.

453
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,031
Well,

454
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:12,870
here's the reality,

455
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:13,441
you guys,

456
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:15,510
what you've done is a real show.

457
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,501
It's a real show.

458
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:19,830
It's just like having a TV show and people
don't think it's TV show because it's

459
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:22,320
not on NBC or CBS or Fox,

460
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:23,154
but it's the same guy.

461
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,180
They'll be,

462
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,090
that's what we're filming.

463
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,880
November's not supposed to say.

464
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,031
No,

465
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:27,631
I can say that.

466
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:28,081
Oh yeah,

467
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:28,500
that's all.

468
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,550
We start shooting November.

469
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:30,211
We have the director,

470
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:30,901
the production team,

471
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:32,090
that's what we're doing right in APP.

472
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,810
So it's a,

473
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,720
it's a show like,

474
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,420
like it's a successful
entertainment vehicle.

475
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,470
That's what it is,

476
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,800
you know,

477
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,260
and that's what podcasts
are and they don't,

478
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,230
they seem like they're horse shit and
people are used to make fun of them

479
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:46,860
before,

480
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,071
you know,

481
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,671
Howard Stern,

482
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:49,440
before he got into that thing with Ari,

483
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,450
he made fun of a podcast.

484
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:52,950
When Adam Carolla came on his show,

485
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:53,381
he was like,

486
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:53,620
wait,

487
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,090
are you,

488
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,080
are you hurting for money?

489
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:55,270
I'm like,

490
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,100
what's going on?

491
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,410
Know Adam Carolla owns a
fucking giant warehouse.

492
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:02,350
He's got like 10 different
podcasts running simultaneously.

493
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,090
Raking it in.

494
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,290
People are threatened by it.

495
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:05,501
Right.

496
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:08,050
And also the thing with
podcasts and there's no,

497
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,990
there's no kind of standard
to start a podcast.

498
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:12,610
So if Joe Schmoe and
start when he can stolen.

499
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,230
So there's a ton of them out there.

500
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,450
There's some fucking awesome podcasts,

501
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:17,320
but just like anything,

502
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:17,950
there's just,

503
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,690
there's a ton of shitty
radio shows out there.

504
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,700
There's a ton of Shitty TV out there,

505
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,100
but there's a bunch of
good content out there,

506
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:24,530
man.

507
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,140
100% there's some real good ones.

508
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:26,441
Damn.

509
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:27,274
This dude in the white,

510
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,040
he keeps landing those
fucking leg kicks on.

511
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:30,580
This dude,

512
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,301
the other guy's name,

513
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:34,660
his willingness to dam the
will is wellness on the right.

514
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,970
Basic ass basketball shorts.

515
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:37,540
He said,

516
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,373
fuck it.

517
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,940
He didn't get the Reebok kiss.

518
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,610
Give me those eighth grade basketball
are kicking the shit out of each other's

519
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,110
legs.

520
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,943
Straight up.

521
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,380
It's hurting my legs just watching this.

522
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,320
Oh boom.

523
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,183
Oh,

524
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,083
huge left hook.

525
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,060
This is a good fight,

526
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,430
man.

527
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,100
Fight,

528
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,600
but they're standing right
in front of each other.

529
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:56,920
This is an MMA fight for sure.

530
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:58,420
Someone would be in half guard right now,

531
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,850
which I prefer.

532
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:01,811
You know,

533
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:02,291
it's weird,

534
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:02,800
right?

535
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,633
That they,

536
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,800
it's MMA really is the perfect
sport because as cool as
this is to watch guys go

537
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:10,630
off and Stan and strike,

538
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,330
the reality is there's
so open for takedowns.

539
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,800
It's not realistic.

540
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,910
It's not a real fight.

541
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,600
Yeah,

542
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,110
it's not.

543
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,943
It's a difference.

544
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,990
It's almost like a smells like fish.

545
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,100
It is a fight,

546
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,480
but it's a kickboxing fight.

547
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,430
It's a fight with a,

548
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,930
with a set agenda,

549
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,890
like a fight fight.

550
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,030
Some shit's going to go down.

551
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,260
We might go to the ground,

552
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:29,980
whatever.

553
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,730
That's why still love the UFC three
minutes as opposed to five minutes.

554
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:37,270
It's kind of interesting because it's
easier to stand and strike like cardio

555
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:40,180
wise than it is to grapple
and strike at the same time.

556
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,830
The only different differences.

557
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:42,880
If we grapple,

558
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,770
I can get breaks.

559
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,550
Maybe.

560
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,151
What did you fight in?

561
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:46,984
Cane.

562
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,580
There's no breaks.

563
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,590
That's how Cain breaks dudes.

564
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,440
True breaks you because it's
going to take some breaks though.

565
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,071
Well,

566
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:54,851
I did Max.

567
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:58,820
It's around when he's balls deep in
your Chin with his head dead five that

568
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,440
you're fucked and he's like
taking a second off things,

569
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,530
going back to beat your brains.

570
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:06,130
In Junior dos Santos
taking tiny little breaks.

571
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:06,701
Oh No,

572
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:08,170
he's taking years away from your life.

573
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,580
He's definitely incentives like,

574
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:10,270
Huh.

575
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,103
That's the same dude.

576
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,890
Yeah,

577
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,120
you're bat shit crazy thing.

578
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,390
That's the same thing that he's the
same dude after that fight with our DCO.

579
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,470
Uh,

580
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,240
I've heard,

581
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,460
I've heard a lot of things were,

582
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,711
you know,

583
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:21,970
came to have the great camp.

584
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:22,631
He didn't get there.

585
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:22,871
You know,

586
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:23,531
I've heard a tenant,

587
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:24,970
we didn't get there early enough.

588
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,810
Correct?

589
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,650
It's still got his ass.

590
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:26,980
What?

591
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,460
Yeah.

592
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,090
So,

593
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:28,311
but,

594
00:14:28,311 --> 00:14:28,720
but it,

595
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,740
this is Cain man.

596
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,480
So I've heard a lot of the
things that went on there.

597
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:33,640
So I think they fight at sea level,

598
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,911
you know,

599
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:34,744
we're going to see,

600
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,640
but to say that fight took
years off Keynes life.

601
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:36,771
No,

602
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:37,510
I don't think so.

603
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,321
Not like the same way.

604
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:39,940
Junior dos Santos Kane did.

605
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,073
Do you think,

606
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,110
do you have any reservations
about them fighting in Brazil?

607
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,020
If I'm Cain and I'm like,

608
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,450
what the fuck the fuck's wrong with you?

609
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,440
What's wrong with you man?

610
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,150
I'm a champion.

611
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,960
How long are you?

612
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,870
Probably the wolves,

613
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:54,501
but he's,

614
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:56,090
can we some drug that's in this bitch?

615
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,320
Fabrizio was the champ.

616
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,430
They'll still be drug testing.

617
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,930
It'd be Brazilian drug testing.

618
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,153
They should be fine.

619
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,341
Yeah,

620
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:01,941
that'd be fine.

621
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:02,870
That works for everybody.

622
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,310
I think if he tore Belfort's doctors,

623
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,690
uh,

624
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,980
responsible for some,

625
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,940
some of that over there.

626
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,240
Yeah,

627
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,900
for sure.

628
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,733
He knows what he's doing.

629
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,470
Oh,

630
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,460
don't get me started.

631
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,020
I fought in Brazil's a,

632
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:13,790
Huh?

633
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,623
What?

634
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,770
I don't feel good.

635
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,320
You have the truck exhaust
pouring into my locker.

636
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,430
You'll be fine.

637
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,263
Swear to God.

638
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,463
Swear on my life.

639
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,820
My coach truck exhausted,

640
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,800
pouring it back up.

641
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:29,720
Trucks where I fought in the trucks were
backed up and on and the exhaust coming

642
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:30,550
in my locker room.

643
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,430
[inaudible] we're all sleepy
and my coach goes pro,

644
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,700
bro.

645
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,540
Wake the fuck up.

646
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:35,751
I go,

647
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:36,260
what?

648
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,441
Oh,

649
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:37,460
I'm there six hours early.

650
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,880
By the way.

651
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,713
He was wake up,

652
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,650
dude.

653
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,450
Everyone and everyone like down.

654
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:41,781
He's like,

655
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:44,180
it's the truck fumes to get outta here.

656
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,280
So we had to go outside
and warm up outside.

657
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,590
No true story.

658
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,030
That's crazy.

659
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:51,590
That's like getting drugs are weird,

660
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:52,330
man.

661
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,180
You're in Brazil.

662
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,750
You think [inaudible]
you're striking coach,

663
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,940
you're sucking fumes from trucks.

664
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,200
Terrible idea.

665
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:04,040
There's a lot of things that could've
gone better and that situation,

666
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
but I find it weird how
life works out though.

667
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:08,240
It all leads to this.

668
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:08,841
Yeah,

669
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:09,231
it is.

670
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:09,711
How weird,

671
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:10,640
how life works out.

672
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,540
Well,

673
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:11,841
you know,

674
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:15,590
it doesn't always like some people are
defeated by setbacks and some people you

675
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:17,150
set to to move forward.

676
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,770
It's like we were
talking about Ryan Bader,

677
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,330
he's a perfect example.

678
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,800
I had a couple of years ago,

679
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,540
people were writing Ryan Bader off.

680
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,560
It wasn't that long ago.

681
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,610
I agree.

682
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,560
100% I agree.

683
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,401
Now looking at beats,

684
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,500
Osp beats phase Xiao,

685
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,370
you know,

686
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,680
looks fucking fantastic
against Phil Davis.

687
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,630
Looks fantastic against Rashad.

688
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:36,771
You know,

689
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:37,271
fuck that.

690
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:37,461
I'd be,

691
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:40,070
if I didn't have this podcast and
these live shows and shit right now,

692
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,720
I'd be in training camp getting ready for,

693
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,310
I'd probably some black beast on
fucking fight pass black beast.

694
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,271
He called me on.

695
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:48,080
That's why I said it.

696
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,270
I was hitting it.

697
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,940
Yeah.

698
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,361
Hey Bro,

699
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:50,691
for sure.

700
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:51,770
Pick a guy can actually fight.

701
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,470
That'd be a fight that I would actually
encourage you to probably take.

702
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:54,831
Yeah,

703
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:55,211
me too.

704
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:55,610
I do it.

705
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,600
I grip this Jay Leno Denim shirt
bright off right now and beat him up.

706
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,580
He's a tough guy though.

707
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,630
He's a tough guy.

708
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,411
He was very tough.

709
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:07,010
He hits a friend,

710
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:07,431
the UFC,

711
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:08,270
they're all tough.

712
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,070
Not as tough as be shop.

713
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,150
What do you think about,

714
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:11,690
um,

715
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,523
uh,

716
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,311
the,

717
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:13,641
uh,

718
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,680
the steep aimia chick Ben Rothwell fight.

719
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,910
That's a really good fight.

720
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,870
That's a great fight,

721
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:18,220
man.

722
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,360
That,

723
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:18,530
that,

724
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,120
that,

725
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,300
that's a tough one to call.

726
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,920
That's a super tough one to call.

727
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,841
Really.

728
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:23,210
Really?

729
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,200
It's in Dublin.

730
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,921
That's whatever.

731
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:29,570
So it's whoever Steve pays a BCP is a
motherfucker coming off the Mark Hunt

732
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:29,930
fight.

733
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,430
It depends on which Rothwell we get.

734
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:32,000
You know what I'm saying?

735
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,650
Roth was confident as fuck.

736
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,850
And he's tough as fuck.

737
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,860
He hits hard.

738
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,600
You look at the,

739
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:37,911
you don't,

740
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:39,020
you know more than anybody,

741
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:39,771
but you look at that,

742
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:40,730
Brendan verified,

743
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,650
he beat the shit out of Brendan Vera.

744
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,251
Yeah.

745
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:43,581
With,

746
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:47,120
with me through that spinning back elbow
first whenever Atlanta by heavyweight.

747
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,910
But the thing is is I brought
he and then I come flying in.

748
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:52,320
They click some of that left hook,

749
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,363
which is whatever.

750
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,130
This is how stupid I was
back then when now for me,

751
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:56,821
Ben Rothwell,

752
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:57,061
I went,

753
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:57,450
what?

754
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,201
I argue with my,

755
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,160
imagine Joe Silva.

756
00:17:59,320 --> 00:17:59,611
I'm like,

757
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,271
it's too easy,

758
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:00,690
man.

759
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,590
I need something else.

760
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,973
Ha.

761
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,100
Did you really think I was too?

762
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,620
Yeah.

763
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:04,921
I was like,

764
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:05,011
oh,

765
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,150
this is such an easy fight.

766
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,540
So did you under estimate him 100%
I thought he's this big slow guy.

767
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,530
Just right before we go in the cage.

768
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:17,430
My coach leaster Bolin who heads
muscle farm now Tj Dillashaw is coach.

769
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,151
Looks at me goes,

770
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:18,984
Bro,

771
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,210
this is not a fucking sprint.

772
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,470
Let's drag his ass in the third round
and submit them his know Jujitsu drags us

773
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:25,981
in third round.

774
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:26,814
Don't go crazy.

775
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,893
You got it.

776
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,853
Go in there.

777
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,400
Go on there.

778
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,911
It's spinning.

779
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:30,990
Elbow wobbled.

780
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,070
Fucking go crazy.

781
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:34,320
It clipped fucking idiot,

782
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,154
man.

783
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,870
I loved how he fought
against Overeem dude.

784
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,130
Mitre own packing heat,

785
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:41,580
man.

786
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,410
It's scary guy with experience like that.

787
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:44,244
It's tough.

788
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,751
He's scary,

789
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:45,991
dude.

790
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,370
We'll see man suit like Steve.

791
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:48,510
Steve Bay's a motherfucker,

792
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:52,500
he's just gotta be in incredible shape
for Steve Bay cause steep pays so fit.

793
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,910
He's so fit.

794
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:54,571
And you know,

795
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:58,050
he gained a lot of confidence in the
junior dos Santos fight when five hard

796
00:18:58,051 --> 00:18:59,880
rounds Dosantos in a war.

797
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,410
It was a really close war.

798
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,380
And then he goes from that to
beat the shit out of Mark Hunt.

799
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,210
I mean steep pays on a roll right now.

800
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,721
This is the,

801
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:07,740
this is the only,

802
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,390
I think x factor in this fight
is Rothwell is so fucking tough.

803
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:15,390
And Rothwell has knocked out power
where Steve Bay really doesn't.

804
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:15,871
Yeah.

805
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:16,950
Steve Bay is more of a,

806
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:17,580
um,

807
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,990
he's a a volume guy.

808
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,441
Look at that.

809
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:21,480
Look at that tsunami on TV with the Rock.

810
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:24,690
Do you see that tsunami to listen dog?

811
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:25,680
The Shit is how excited.

812
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,220
Andres,

813
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,030
this is you.

814
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,780
This is you.

815
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,430
Here we go.

816
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,263
This is

817
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,240
Rena Delray having a little party.

818
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:33,541
Hey,

819
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,680
everything's going to be fine.

820
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,300
Oh my God.

821
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,830
Why is the ground moving?

822
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,820
Oh my God,

823
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,901
I'm in a condo.

824
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:40,471
Don't worry.

825
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,720
This conduct is waterproof.

826
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,390
That's what I'm talking about.

827
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:46,224
That kind of shit.

828
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:47,843
That kind of shit.

829
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,890
That kind of shit ain't
nothing for the world.

830
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,930
I hate to tell you you're
fucked to where you're at.

831
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,170
If that big thing comes,

832
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,240
we're all fucked.

833
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,901
C'Mon man.

834
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:57,540
Can I just can I just hate
on nothing of the hammer.

835
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,903
Not The nail.

836
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,980
I got it all planned out,

837
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:02,191
bro.

838
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:04,800
I got water saved up the waters.

839
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:06,060
Lease your fucking problems.

840
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,281
Got Real issues,

841
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:08,700
man.

842
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,533
It's common.

843
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,241
Oh,

844
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:12,074
Steve Bay route.

845
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,830
Steve Pay Rothwell's a hell of a fight,

846
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:14,370
man.

847
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,960
I can't believe that's not the main event.

848
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,610
Who is it?

849
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,790
Duffy and Duffy employees are great,

850
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,110
but it's a great fight off the east.

851
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,650
Jo Duffy's a fucking Duffy's.

852
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,260
Boxing's ridiculous.

853
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,470
He's a very good Conor McGregor.

854
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,050
He's got good kicking too.

855
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,140
He's got a really good overall may game.

856
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:36,470
He mixes things up monster to man.

857
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:37,710
Especially at that weight class.

858
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:38,600
Yeah.

859
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,770
Pull a waste going.

860
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,643
I can't believe it.

861
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,220
I just can't believe steep bay.

862
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,740
Was he right nor two in the world.

863
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,780
He'll get a main event.

864
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,130
Is he number two now?

865
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:47,651
It's Keynes.

866
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:47,980
Gotta be

867
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,813
number one.

868
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,830
Junior dos Santos are steep.

869
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,270
What junior's injured right now is he?

870
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,441
No,

871
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:55,090
he's fine now he's fighting
over to him in December.

872
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:55,481
Right.

873
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:59,560
But he was just coming off a
surgery through any did Steve Bay.

874
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,500
But that steep ab mark with jds beat mark.

875
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:02,770
Yeah.

876
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,020
But junior beat steep in his last fight.

877
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:07,760
I think he's gotta be number one out.

878
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:08,920
Sub side cane.

879
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,330
I think Keynes got to be number one.

880
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:12,370
And then juniors gotta be number two.

881
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,960
No,

882
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,780
it would make sense Steve Base three.

883
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,260
Yeah.

884
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,060
And then our last keys for round five.

885
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,830
There's some fucking weird
weird shit with a rating one to,

886
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:25,490
I don't know who the fuck does him.

887
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,690
Some of the ratings were real weird man.

888
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:30,730
Sometimes guys beat guys
and they're below him.

889
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:31,331
And the ratings,

890
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:31,781
you're like wait,

891
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:32,830
it's super weird.

892
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,540
I don't understand how they work.

893
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,650
Who Decides?

894
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,341
That's what I'm saying.

895
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:37,810
Who the fuck the sides?

896
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:38,861
Yeah.

897
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:39,850
Like your why a hall.

898
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:41,140
Here's a perfect example.

899
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,370
Uriah Hall.

900
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:43,360
Where's Musashi?

901
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,800
Above Uriah Hall.

902
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,730
Weill Hall just jumped,

903
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:47,531
Spinning Back,

904
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:48,370
kick gay garb.

905
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:49,930
Musashi in the face,

906
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,681
flying.

907
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:53,860
Need him in the face and
then beat him down for a Tko.

908
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,980
So you tell me how the fuck is Uriah Hall
number 10 and Gay Garden was saucy is

909
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:02,860
number eight with all due respect
and gay guards a great fighter.

910
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,840
And people like he's a better fighter.

911
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,411
No,

912
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:06,560
he's not talk.

913
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,691
And he lost.

914
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:08,350
I agree.

915
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,310
Uriah Hall's the better fighter you might
locate gay guard Musashi's background.

916
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:12,431
Say,

917
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:12,851
well no,

918
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:14,320
you got to see gay Garmin saucy.

919
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,720
He beat jock array in Japan.

920
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,140
He beat Dan Henderson.

921
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:20,741
You know,

922
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:21,270
he,

923
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,040
I mean you look at his victories
in the UFC and he'd go,

924
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:24,221
well,

925
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:25,690
he's gotta be the guy,

926
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,220
but no fire.

927
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,170
[inaudible] hall fought him and beat him.

928
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,101
He should be above them.

929
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:30,641
And the rankings,

930
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,620
those rankings are crazy.

931
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,700
100% those are crazy rankings.

932
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:37,150
Like what the fuck do you have to do
to move up in the rankings if you can't

933
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,230
jump spinning back,

934
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,900
kick a guy in the face and then
flying Nia guy in the face.

935
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,590
By the way,

936
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,670
in the second round.

937
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:43,180
I agree.

938
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,391
Yeah,

939
00:22:43,391 --> 00:22:44,290
he lost the first round.

940
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,550
He got taken down and dominated.

941
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:49,270
But so did Anderson Silva when Anderson
Silva fought shale sun in the second

942
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:49,820
time.

943
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,380
Well we got to still ranked shale son
and above Anderson Silva after Annison

944
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:54,440
kneed him in the body and,

945
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,120
and,

946
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,691
and uh,

947
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:56,740
and stopped him in the,

948
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:57,580
in the third fight.

949
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,880
I don't think the second fight rather
have a rhyme or reason to the banking

950
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:01,570
madness.

951
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,970
Like remember when they were going to
pay guys based off their rank and I was

952
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:04,804
like what?

953
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,680
What?

954
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,000
That's fucking insane.

955
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:09,430
Crazy cause that's up for debate.

956
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:09,790
Right?

957
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,000
How,

958
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,833
who makes that?

959
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,460
I need to know.

960
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,730
I think it's a bunch of dude.

961
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,380
How's that?

962
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,500
That that is one of the most big
go back to where it was pleased.

963
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:17,920
Hey good.

964
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,311
Good luck.

965
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:19,900
That ranking the lightweights.

966
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,291
Yeah,

967
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:24,310
but that is one of the worst ranking
system situations I've ever seen.

968
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,530
When you win in a spectacular way,

969
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:30,640
like Uriah Hall just did and you are
not were awarded by moving up in the

970
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:31,474
rankings.

971
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,320
That's,

972
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,110
that's the definition of insanity
and it doesn't make any sense.

973
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,330
That's goofy as fuck man.

974
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,720
There's Jason Wellness
getting a little Vaseline.

975
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,730
Let me see those light weight rankings.

976
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:42,941
Good.

977
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:45,230
Like how the fuck do you
rank all those monsters?

978
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,220
That okay.

979
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,540
Number one,

980
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,350
who do we got here?

981
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,420
Pedis makes sense to Serone.

982
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,283
Makes Sense.

983
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:51,771
Normal.

984
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:51,891
Good.

985
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:55,130
Madoff three all make
sense Eddie Alvarez for,

986
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,120
okay.

987
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,130
Eddie Alvarez only has one
victory in the UFC though,

988
00:23:58,131 --> 00:23:58,371
right?

989
00:23:58,371 --> 00:23:58,851
That's tough.

990
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:01,040
So they're going based
off his bride Melendez.

991
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,270
He'd beat Melendez.

992
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,710
Michael Johnson,

993
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,610
Michael Johnson's very high level
right now he's looking real good.

994
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,920
Michael Johnson just
lose to somebody or yeah,

995
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:11,390
he,

996
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:11,571
no,

997
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:12,260
he lost.

998
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,400
But he actually beat him.

999
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,300
But he lost the control decision
to homeboy from a black house.

1000
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:18,050
Great striker.

1001
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:18,561
Oh yeah.

1002
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:19,394
But Neal dairy,

1003
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,141
dairy,

1004
00:24:20,141 --> 00:24:20,550
you should,

1005
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,890
whereas in the ratings,

1006
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:23,870
he's down at number 10 that's interesting.

1007
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,940
So Michael Johnson is all the way
up at number five and he lost.

1008
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:28,790
Have Been Neil diary you.

1009
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:29,780
She's number 10.

1010
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,793
Hmm.

1011
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,290
That is fucking interesting is shit.

1012
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,730
But get fucking welter weight,

1013
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:35,030
man.

1014
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,400
That's a weird one because that's one
were a lot of people thought that Michael

1015
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,350
John's got a raw deal.

1016
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:39,741
Yeah,

1017
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:41,120
100% and I could drop.

1018
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:41,481
Must Be.

1019
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,210
And he wasn't at all the ratings.

1020
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:43,900
And I'm a dairy.

1021
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,100
Huge Fan and I think he lost that fight.

1022
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,761
I'm a dairy.

1023
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:47,390
Which fan as well?

1024
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,470
Big Fan and he's bad.

1025
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:49,070
Motherfucker.

1026
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,491
Miles.

1027
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:50,690
Jury number nine.

1028
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,351
I thought miles,

1029
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:53,960
jury and move to
featherweight now isn't he?

1030
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,280
Did he move to featherweight?

1031
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,180
Isn't he fighting someone in the
featherweight division is the next one.

1032
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:00,014
I thought so too.

1033
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,263
Hmm?

1034
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,750
Have you ever watched his ink master?

1035
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,643
This is a good show.

1036
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,760
I have watched.

1037
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:08,000
It seems weird to have contests
on Permacol a dig it man.

1038
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,190
Permanent artwork on someone's body.

1039
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,093
Navarro though.

1040
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,081
Fuck sakes,

1041
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:12,291
Bro.

1042
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,270
Easy on the eye makeup.

1043
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,640
Huh?

1044
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,270
I like him.

1045
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:14,870
Beautiful Man.

1046
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,703
You know what?

1047
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,191
Don't you run?

1048
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:16,701
I'm a fan.

1049
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:18,440
I heard he has a hockey
with Carmen Electra.

1050
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,363
However,

1051
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,800
if you,

1052
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,570
you got to chill out on my makeup,

1053
00:25:21,571 --> 00:25:22,330
Bro.

1054
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,780
If I'm going to continue
to watch the show.

1055
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,410
Uh,

1056
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:24,770
let's see.

1057
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,150
Welter weight out mother fucker.

1058
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,010
Here's the dark horse in
the lightweight division.

1059
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,950
Now Thompson,

1060
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:33,440
he motherfucking Ferguson.

1061
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,150
That's your dark horse right there,

1062
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,110
Tony.

1063
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,321
Oh,

1064
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:36,901
for sure.

1065
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:38,260
Tony Ferguson's the dark horse.

1066
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:38,601
First of all,

1067
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:40,370
he's the hardest hitter
and the entire division.

1068
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:41,330
He spooky too.

1069
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,590
There's something spooky about him.

1070
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,401
He's so game.

1071
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:44,240
It's insane.

1072
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:44,770
He's,

1073
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,000
he's a bad motherfucker,

1074
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:46,843
dude,

1075
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,391
bro.

1076
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:50,720
How do you have Kelvin
ranked 15 didn't he?

1077
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,640
Did Calvin when his last fight at one 85
and then they allowed them to fight at

1078
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:56,474
one 70 again.

1079
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,261
That's what happened.

1080
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:57,471
Right.

1081
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:58,100
Beat Nate.

1082
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,610
That's right.

1083
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,480
The shit out of Nate.

1084
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,961
That's right.

1085
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:00,794
And they forced him out.

1086
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,190
Yeah.

1087
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,050
That was the sad fight.

1088
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,320
I did not enjoy that fight.

1089
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,580
Fucking terrible.

1090
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,600
And Nate's still fighting.

1091
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:05,990
Uh,

1092
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,823
anyways.

1093
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,791
How about Hendrix?

1094
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:08,810
How about your boy Hendrix?

1095
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,401
Yeah.

1096
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:12,260
Are they gonna make him
fight a middleweight now?

1097
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,460
He said he's not fighting middle age,

1098
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,540
so he's going to go one more time.

1099
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,200
It went 70.

1100
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,300
Well,

1101
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,133
how's he going to do that?

1102
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,300
That would cause Dana White's it.

1103
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:18,250
I consider him a minute wait,

1104
00:26:18,251 --> 00:26:19,130
and I miss wait,

1105
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,540
fucked everybody up.

1106
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,231
Fucked up.

1107
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:23,300
Tyrone's would tell a guy
what weight to fight it.

1108
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,160
Especially your Johny Hendricks.

1109
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:29,750
Well you can if you won't give them a
fight at one 70 because you got to such a

1110
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:30,950
talent rich division.

1111
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:33,020
I mean look at what you got
down there at welterweight.

1112
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,883
Look at this.

1113
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,420
You got Rory Macdonald,

1114
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,470
Tyron Woodley,

1115
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,850
you got Hendrix,

1116
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,953
then you go those guys,

1117
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,360
guest stars and hacks.

1118
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,750
But people don't pay to see Hendrix
like they pay to see like a George Saint

1119
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,620
Pierre or like a,

1120
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,670
they paid to see,

1121
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,241
you know,

1122
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:52,770
like some of the bigger stars in the
UFC because a lot of people thought that

1123
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:53,550
Hendrix,

1124
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,020
like in some of his victories,

1125
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:56,460
like the Matte Brown fight,

1126
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,440
they thought that it wasn't that exciting.

1127
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:58,891
True.

1128
00:26:58,891 --> 00:26:59,140
See,

1129
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,911
I disagree.

1130
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:01,420
I'll pay to see that
guy any day of the week,

1131
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,910
but I think he's fighting smart.

1132
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:03,420
I agree.

1133
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,220
I liked that he uses his wrestling bro.

1134
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,420
Besides Robbie Lawler,

1135
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:08,100
who's the most sane guy in the division?

1136
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,610
Comments.

1137
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,660
Pretty God damn exciting.

1138
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,070
But he's been gone for a while,

1139
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:11,821
but he's excited.

1140
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:12,270
It's fun.

1141
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,880
But he just knocked out Taco
Alvarez with nasty elbow.

1142
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:17,930
Matt Brown is about as exciting
as a fucking human being can get.

1143
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:18,691
I'm saying exciting.

1144
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:20,940
I'm saying to a bigger named
Johnny Hendricks Bolt Near.

1145
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:22,380
Those guys are bigger
than Hendricks conduct.

1146
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:22,981
You can say,

1147
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:24,060
but he's been gone for awhile.

1148
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,620
Interests tend to cause a big name,

1149
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:26,280
Bro.

1150
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,270
He's a big name,

1151
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:31,110
but I don't necessarily know how
that translates to pay per view buys,

1152
00:27:31,111 --> 00:27:32,990
which at the end of the
day is all they care.

1153
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,670
Huge fat.

1154
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,510
I'm just saying a guy like
Johnny Hendricks at what
is the a two time champion?

1155
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,170
You can't say,

1156
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:37,291
Oh,

1157
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:38,700
you got to set it when 85 if he's like,

1158
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:38,861
no,

1159
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:39,001
no,

1160
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:40,230
I'm making it what you do.

1161
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:43,620
If he doesn't make the weight more than
once and he's already missed the weight

1162
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,454
twice,

1163
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,301
he's missed.

1164
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:47,940
Wait twice and barely made
it for one of the Lawler.

1165
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,290
He came in way over.

1166
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:51,850
Wait for this to like 26
pounds when I heard him.

1167
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,470
Come on.

1168
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,920
Yeah,

1169
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,850
he was heavy as fuck.

1170
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:54,511
Meanwhile,

1171
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:56,800
Joe Schilling is about
to fucking throw down.

1172
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:57,634
Let's do this.

1173
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,513
It now,

1174
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,610
stitch him up.

1175
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,220
This is a big,

1176
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:03,330
big fight and hit the guy.

1177
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:03,850
He's fighting.

1178
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,210
Chasing wellness is a fucking beast.

1179
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,220
Wellness's nasty.

1180
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,001
Really,

1181
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:09,781
really hard.

1182
00:28:09,781 --> 00:28:10,650
Striker man.

1183
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,220
Your boy Schilling flex and them.

1184
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,260
I'm not mad at it either.

1185
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,271
The body,

1186
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:15,700
that was pretty yoked audit up.

1187
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,960
This is a good one.

1188
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,100
It's a good matchup.

1189
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,150
Stylist at 24 24 and nasty dude.

1190
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:25,920
He's real good man.

1191
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,371
Yeah,

1192
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:26,631
that,

1193
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:28,140
that welterweight division is tough.

1194
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:28,960
Yeah,

1195
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,490
it's tough.

1196
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,690
How's Hendricks do at one 85 how's
he match up with 85 minutes for?

1197
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,073
I don't like it.

1198
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:34,920
How's he meant?

1199
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,460
Okay.

1200
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,420
You gotta go to the champ.

1201
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,560
You go to the top of the,

1202
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,060
scroll down to middle eight for me.

1203
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:39,570
Jamie.

1204
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:40,620
When whenever you do that,

1205
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:41,580
you go to the top of the heap.

1206
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:42,870
How does he match up with the champ?

1207
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,733
Bad idea.

1208
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,091
Other than that,

1209
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:45,810
I like a good,

1210
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,380
I liked them.

1211
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,861
Please.

1212
00:28:46,861 --> 00:28:47,820
How does he match up with Luke?

1213
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:49,110
Rockhold not so good.

1214
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,420
How's the matchup with
joc right and not so good.

1215
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,870
How's he matchup with Yoel
Romero not so like disagree.

1216
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,340
Yoel Romero.

1217
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,160
I think he'd beat too.

1218
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,780
I'll remember like,

1219
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,620
oh my God.

1220
00:28:58,621 --> 00:28:59,550
Are you crazy?

1221
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,310
That one hurts my feeling.

1222
00:29:02,311 --> 00:29:02,971
Are you serious?

1223
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:04,770
Yoel Romero was a monster.

1224
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,080
UFC champ.

1225
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,231
Yeah,

1226
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:07,671
he's big.

1227
00:29:07,671 --> 00:29:09,860
You see what he did to Leo
Machida in his last fight?

1228
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:11,850
Did he did fuck my boy monster.

1229
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,713
He's a monster.

1230
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,820
How dare you.

1231
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,321
He is,

1232
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:18,660
but at one 70 Johnny Hendricks
is five eight he's small.

1233
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,330
He's five.

1234
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:19,740
Eight.

1235
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,430
He small.

1236
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:20,790
Yeah.

1237
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,640
I mean when I stand next to him in
the octagon and I have shoes on,

1238
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:24,474
I'm taller than him.

1239
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,410
If I'm taller than you,

1240
00:29:25,411 --> 00:29:26,640
you can't fight Yoel Romero.

1241
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,500
That's just how the rules are.

1242
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,600
You and Callan and this height thing.

1243
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,781
Well,

1244
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:30,931
no,

1245
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:32,460
I'm sure DC short.

1246
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:34,110
I'm just saying tiny fucking kicked up,

1247
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,420
but DC's big in a different way.

1248
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,280
I don't think Hendrick's is that big.

1249
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:40,890
I think Hendrick's just
carries too much body fat.

1250
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,870
I think Hendricks at one 70
cause 100% be the champ again.

1251
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,580
100% a hundred percent for sure.

1252
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,420
Figure it out.

1253
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,090
Hendrix,

1254
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:47,980
when he's on,

1255
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,010
I mean you got to look at his knockouts
of Martin Kampmann and John Fitch.

1256
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:52,720
He's a fucking monster when he's on,

1257
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,200
I mean you always have to look at a
guy though based on his last fight.

1258
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,120
That's the unfortunate
thing about fighting.

1259
00:29:58,121 --> 00:29:59,950
They always say you're only
as good as your last fight.

1260
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,510
While his last fight,

1261
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,490
I thought he fought pretty fucking good,

1262
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,330
but then his fight that was
supposed to be his last fight.

1263
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:08,170
He didn't make the weight.

1264
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,790
That's where the controversy lies.

1265
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,420
The controversy lies is lack of discipline
and coming into training camp have a

1266
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,950
heavy more than once.

1267
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,360
I mean not learning his lesson when
he came in super fit for the map.

1268
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:19,570
Brown fight look great.

1269
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:19,951
Sid,

1270
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,360
he got ahold of his meal prep.

1271
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,260
It's tough to argue this fight.

1272
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:27,820
He came into camp 10 pounds heavier than
his last camp according to adult shake.

1273
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,620
10 pounds is a lot man.

1274
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:29,801
Well,

1275
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:31,240
he didn't work with Delta
for this gap though,

1276
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,550
but dolce knows what he came in at.

1277
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,370
Doody came in at this camp versus
what he came in at the last camp.

1278
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,290
Everybody knows it.

1279
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,790
I mean they've all admitted it.

1280
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:41,170
He admitted it when he
talks about when he's,

1281
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,220
it was camp went wrong,

1282
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,140
he talked about it and then
you got to get a kidney stone.

1283
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,250
Can't do it at this level.

1284
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:50,860
What the fuck we do and might
have an eating disorder.

1285
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:51,251
You know,

1286
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:53,260
we were talking earlier
about being addicted to shit.

1287
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,730
He might be addicted
to eating and it might,

1288
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,460
it might be addicted to
eating and then if he is,

1289
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:58,011
I am Paul.

1290
00:30:58,011 --> 00:30:58,841
His discipline,

1291
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:00,760
the discipline of being a fighter,

1292
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,061
you know,

1293
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:03,280
it might be so overwhelming
that when he's not doing it,

1294
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:05,290
he just a gorgeous the fuck up dude.

1295
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,140
He'll get to his level
that have discipline.

1296
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,390
I don't know what's going on.

1297
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,890
Their discipline and addiction sometimes
our next door neighbor's got that

1298
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:12,701
middle weight division.

1299
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:13,534
Here we go.

1300
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,261
Joe Schilling,

1301
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:15,100
Jason Wellness.

1302
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,023
Here we go.

1303
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:17,261
Come on.

1304
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:17,750
Let's just,

1305
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,420
how do you get nervous
when your friends fight?

1306
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,710
Fuck yes.

1307
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,200
Fuck yeah to always.

1308
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,180
Oh always.

1309
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,040
No way around it.

1310
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,023
Nope.

1311
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,710
That's just part of the worst.

1312
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,880
It's part of the sport.

1313
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,890
I can't imagine my family watch me fight.

1314
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,480
How about if your son was fighting?

1315
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,040
My found daughter starts fighting.

1316
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,221
Oh,

1317
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:37,240
Jesus Dodgers.

1318
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:38,140
Next Ronda Rousey.

1319
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,130
Whoa.

1320
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,851
Jason Walsall.

1321
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:41,020
Nice led Jesus Christ.

1322
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:44,960
Should I spinning back fist but showing
she leaves a bad motherfucker too.

1323
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:46,270
Especially at kickboxing.

1324
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,100
Kickboxing is his shit.

1325
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,260
His defense is tighter at kickboxing.

1326
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:52,930
It's just this movements
and nasty as fuck.

1327
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,051
Oh,

1328
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:53,680
he's excellent.

1329
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,570
And when he doesn't have to
worry about being taken down,

1330
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,150
then he gets loose loose.

1331
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:58,631
Oh,

1332
00:31:58,631 --> 00:31:59,510
he's a bad motherfucker.

1333
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,580
He looks so much better.

1334
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,380
The kit has kickboxing way better.

1335
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,273
Yeah.

1336
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,790
He's just,

1337
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,810
he looks like a world champion.

1338
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,130
Just be the best of the load at this.

1339
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:06,591
Fuck.

1340
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,120
MMA.

1341
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,660
Yeah.

1342
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,050
Let's go run this Joe and listening.

1343
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,840
Well we got,

1344
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,750
we assume he wins and we still fight.

1345
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:13,630
And Jason Wellness.

1346
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,231
We'll look at that.

1347
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:14,650
See,

1348
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,640
wellness is not junk,

1349
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,540
but God Damn Joe looks aggressive
at all witnesses defect.

1350
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:19,374
Holy Shit.

1351
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:19,990
It is.

1352
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,020
But Joe Schilling is lighten them up with
those front kicks to the body to boom

1353
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:23,591
is another one.

1354
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:27,100
Son and your boy shelling
of the smoke shop sponsor.

1355
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,590
He likes the weed.

1356
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,760
Oh well Michelle kick with nasty damn
shelling us eating him up though.

1357
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,590
Showing of the affliction sponsor too.

1358
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,800
Damn affliction.

1359
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,930
Still alive affliction said God dammit.

1360
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,990
Rybak the one guy died and they got
rid of Tom Atencio so who the fuck is

1361
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:50,540
affliction so and bottom out
just like the bought out.

1362
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,080
Tap Out.

1363
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,913
Wow.

1364
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,050
That's interesting bro.

1365
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:58,850
I used to rock those affliction shirts
with like fucking both silver and angel

1366
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:03,851
wings and it said like fade or on the
back while I was friends with Atencio and

1367
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:05,660
I liked what he did for fighters.

1368
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,930
He sponsored a lot of fighters and I uh,

1369
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,730
I supported them because of that.

1370
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,820
Like I didn't need the affliction
of money they were giving me.

1371
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,690
It wasn't that much,

1372
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,130
it was just a little bit,

1373
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:20,600
but in my mind I thought it was a good
idea to support a company that was given

1374
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:21,500
fighters a lot of money.

1375
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:25,460
They were sponsoring a lot of fighters
and they put together that affliction MMA

1376
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,410
card and gave people a shitload of money.

1377
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:27,801
Damn.

1378
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:28,850
Joe Schilling looks good.

1379
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,860
They fucked up on that card though.

1380
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:33,860
They put all their money on that
one card and it was so dope.

1381
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,810
The card was stacked.

1382
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:36,891
Damn.

1383
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:37,311
Shilling.

1384
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:38,720
Look real loose,

1385
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,190
dropping his hands,

1386
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:40,970
moving light.

1387
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:44,540
His foot works ridiculous
and is looks real frustrated.

1388
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:46,220
He's kind of like paralyzed a man.

1389
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,720
He's combinations.

1390
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,520
He might just be weathering the storm.

1391
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,150
He might be or it might
be getting his ass.

1392
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:54,940
He this five rounds so
they go five rounds.

1393
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,783
Just going to title.

1394
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,250
It's a good question
because it's the main event.

1395
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,090
Damn Joe shelling with the movement.

1396
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,410
Ooh Look

1397
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,470
good shows married.

1398
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:08,371
Yeah,

1399
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:08,790
he's got,

1400
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,890
well he's got a woman
that's got some kids.

1401
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:13,920
I think as you engage with
basically married though basically

1402
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,683
what's going on,

1403
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,880
what happened or free stepped in,

1404
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,920
stop something worn something.

1405
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:22,121
I don't,

1406
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:22,954
I don't know what happened.

1407
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,451
Damn.

1408
00:34:25,451 --> 00:34:26,560
Throwing up front kicks.

1409
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,880
He though when you're a tall fighter like
that does front kicks to the body are

1410
00:34:30,881 --> 00:34:31,720
really nice.

1411
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,020
Yeah.

1412
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,280
He's been a nice option.

1413
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,540
Tough to counter that man.

1414
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,070
Good defense here by shilling to,

1415
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:38,770
he's is a different animal when
he's kickbox he's confident.

1416
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:39,820
He's confident.

1417
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:44,110
It's a sport is defense is way better
with those big gloves is like super used

1418
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:44,240
to.

1419
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,560
It can also sound risk more.

1420
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:45,970
Yup.

1421
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:48,730
And he's not worried about being
taken down so he could do his shit.

1422
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,730
We'll have to talk them into
fighting only kickboxing.

1423
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:52,991
Yeah,

1424
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:53,950
give me an hour with them.

1425
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,563
Look at this man.

1426
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,311
God Damn,

1427
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:58,031
he's looking good.

1428
00:34:58,031 --> 00:34:59,500
Boom Bang Bang.

1429
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:01,020
One to definitely I like,

1430
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,140
I like how he's throwing the straight
right and then a hard jab behind it too.

1431
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,910
You know like after that right hand.

1432
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,160
Like a lot of MMA fighters especially,

1433
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,520
they'll pull back and then look for
either another right hand or whatever.

1434
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,650
He stepping in hard with that jam.

1435
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:15,821
Tell you what,

1436
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:18,970
I don't like that Magnus
Urena and up here he full.

1437
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,473
Come on.

1438
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,630
Well I don't think this sport,

1439
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,480
I don't think the sport gets
the attention that it deserves.

1440
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:25,840
You know,

1441
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,710
as excited as you and I were for this
fight and this card like to me this is

1442
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,410
like an opportunity to
watch high level fighting.

1443
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,300
Like whether or not it's
MMA or it kicked off.

1444
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,153
I like,

1445
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,120
like I think the ultimate sport is MMA.

1446
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:40,650
It always will be the ultimate sport.

1447
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:44,040
But when I want to watch the best
expression of striking technique,

1448
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,330
there's certain shit that you only see
when you watch my tie or you only see

1449
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:50,400
when you watch kickboxing
and this is it right here.

1450
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,280
Like these kind of Duke it out battles.

1451
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,120
True.

1452
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,901
I don't get like,

1453
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:58,020
don't get me wrong and I fucked
him some glory kickboxing,

1454
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,520
but I don't get as excited or crunk ignore
or crunk for this as I do for like a

1455
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:03,630
main event in the UFC.

1456
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,830
So different kind of,

1457
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:05,670
yeah.

1458
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,480
Excitement.

1459
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,110
Well I do because Joe is my
friend and I support him,

1460
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:10,391
but I,

1461
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:10,840
I feel,

1462
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,280
yeah,

1463
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,330
but if you know,

1464
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,910
if you're watching like the
very best guys in the world,

1465
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:16,320
go at it in any discipline.

1466
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:16,831
It's fun.

1467
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:17,880
Whether it's boxing,

1468
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:18,271
you know,

1469
00:36:18,271 --> 00:36:20,190
you watch Manny Pacquiao
versus Mayweather.

1470
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,090
It's still fun.

1471
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,630
Hell yeah,

1472
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:21,901
dude.

1473
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:22,490
Wrestling.

1474
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:22,801
Yeah,

1475
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:23,640
the top world.

1476
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,690
You know what I'm saying?

1477
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,190
But I still,

1478
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,900
the best wrestling is even fun to watch,

1479
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,090
but I think this is
way better than boxing.

1480
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,013
I really do.

1481
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,000
I think this is oh big left
hand from Joe Schilling.

1482
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,760
God Damn Dude.

1483
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:41,310
He looks so fucking good tonight.

1484
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,230
He is on it,

1485
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:43,880
man.

1486
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,330
He was all over it.

1487
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,260
The left hook.

1488
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,000
I bet he comes in.

1489
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,581
We just slipped,

1490
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,080
smoked so smooth.

1491
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,160
Everything looks smooth.

1492
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:51,000
His defense,

1493
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:51,834
everything.

1494
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,270
He's not wasting anything is he?

1495
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,720
No,

1496
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:54,931
no.

1497
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:55,171
He's,

1498
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,420
he's fighting nice and find it very nice.

1499
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,970
Very light on his feet.

1500
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,850
Never stand stationary
mics and shit up very well

1501
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,430
to him.

1502
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:09,810
I like how he's like moving out and in
well lifts up for a front kick and then

1503
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,550
punches you in the face and then he's out.

1504
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:11,881
Yeah.

1505
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,530
You don't know what the fuck is going on.

1506
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,760
What's a Rashad's boy?

1507
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:15,900
He's corner Tyrone's.

1508
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,783
Paul,

1509
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,190
what's his deal on stern?

1510
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:19,980
I know he's asking date
and white for a fight.

1511
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,880
He wants money,

1512
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,300
you know,

1513
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,841
he's like,

1514
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:23,340
I want to be paid what I deserve.

1515
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,860
He's one of the best
strikers on the planet earth.

1516
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,970
Haunted does said if I'm
going to fight an MMA,

1517
00:37:27,971 --> 00:37:28,201
he goes,

1518
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:30,710
I want to be treated like
I get treated in kickbox.

1519
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,400
They're trying to give them
that basic as contract.

1520
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:33,270
What are they saying to,

1521
00:37:33,271 --> 00:37:33,770
uh,

1522
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:33,990
uh,

1523
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,970
Fiko the go low or something like that.

1524
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,470
I Dunno what they're offering him.

1525
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,590
I don't know what they're offering him.

1526
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,600
I really have no idea.

1527
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,000
He just needs the exposure.

1528
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,790
I think going to take a um,

1529
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,480
a point away here.

1530
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,620
What's going on in low kick?

1531
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,100
Nope.

1532
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,450
No,

1533
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,160
I can definitely morning.

1534
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,920
They won't walk you around and say 1.1
point right when they take they lift,

1535
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,480
shitty rocked him again.

1536
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,250
I feel like Schilling got,

1537
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,020
oh Jason Walnuts throws hard shots to,

1538
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,690
Oh fuck.

1539
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,560
Oh Shit.

1540
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,580
Oh Shit.

1541
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,680
Schillings holding on man.

1542
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:05,580
He got cracked.

1543
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:06,450
That was a big,

1544
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:06,841
big,

1545
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,580
big punch by wellness.

1546
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,010
Oh my God.

1547
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,310
Oh my God again bro.

1548
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,660
Oh fuck.

1549
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,450
He got hurt.

1550
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,770
He got his really a right hand.

1551
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,370
Wellness is all over him.

1552
00:38:15,371 --> 00:38:17,610
He's got a claim and
use that MMA grappling.

1553
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:17,911
Yeah.

1554
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:18,661
He's got a claim.

1555
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:19,494
He's got a claim.

1556
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:20,370
He's his.

1557
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,400
She had clear the cobwebs right
now it's got to clear the cobwebs.

1558
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,430
That's the scary thing about
wellness man is at Keio power.

1559
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,490
Joe Gets that clench too.

1560
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:30,690
He got hurt bad.

1561
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,331
He got hurt bad.

1562
00:38:31,331 --> 00:38:31,860
And this round.

1563
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,660
I see a powerful Matt Brown and the crowd.

1564
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,470
He does his camps there.

1565
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:37,060
Now does he yell at elevation?

1566
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:37,840
Yup.

1567
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,230
Is everybody going to go to elevation
that Mussel farms coming with that cash?

1568
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,213
You think so?

1569
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,020
Rampage is one of the
first guys to go there,

1570
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:44,490
right?

1571
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:49,380
He did like he did a camp there when they
first opened up but he didn't like it

1572
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,253
again.

1573
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,371
Damn wellness.

1574
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,810
It's hard dude.

1575
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,090
Someone lost their mouthpiece.

1576
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,070
It's your boy.

1577
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,240
Is it pretty sure it's a type move though.

1578
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:00,820
Cause you get a break that
move outside of the road?

1579
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,711
I don't think so.

1580
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:03,850
I don't think it's the
end of the round dude.

1581
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,291
Yeah.

1582
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:05,920
So you get that.

1583
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,060
You get that break.

1584
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,400
Damn boy lost that round.

1585
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,360
Yeah.

1586
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:10,871
Did he tell,

1587
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:12,700
did he knock him down
earlier in the round now?

1588
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,001
No,

1589
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:13,481
not really.

1590
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:14,314
That was the first round,

1591
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,220
was it?

1592
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,790
Boom.

1593
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,660
Oh fuck.

1594
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:17,494
Was that this round?

1595
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,640
The very beginning.

1596
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,391
God,

1597
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:20,300
that's tough man.

1598
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:23,550
That's better than knockdowns
bigger because showing was it?

1599
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,160
Yeah.

1600
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,993
That's bigger.

1601
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,581
Yeah.

1602
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:28,361
He was wobbled too.

1603
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:33,361
That was a real knockdown dude that's
an even round knew cause he knocked him

1604
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:33,730
down.

1605
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,130
Shilling got fucked up.

1606
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,850
He got tagged for sure.

1607
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:37,960
But look,

1608
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,760
he used good defense and clinched up
knockdowns and kickboxing or big dude,

1609
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,200
just like knock downs in boxing.

1610
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,410
They were like a takedown MMA
fight where you get rocked.

1611
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:50,260
Like if a guy gets dropped in an MMA
fight and another guy lands fights like

1612
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,153
punches like that,

1613
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,810
that's a hard fight to score.

1614
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,390
Maybe it's a nine nine round.

1615
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,290
That's what I'm saying.

1616
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:00,220
I could be nine nine but the knocked
down his big dude cause I wouldn't give

1617
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:03,400
them a 10 I wouldn't give
him a ten eight if you,

1618
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,340
what's going on the fights
over what's happening?

1619
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:06,731
What do you do?

1620
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:07,540
Break his foot.

1621
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,231
Oh Shit.

1622
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:09,010
Joe Schilling one.

1623
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:09,521
What happened?

1624
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:10,210
Broke his foot.

1625
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,043
Did he break his foot?

1626
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,710
Oh Wow.

1627
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,331
That's a bomb.

1628
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:16,390
But it was a good fight.

1629
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,770
Good for us to have him.

1630
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,270
Congrats the Joe Schilling.

1631
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:22,060
But after having a round like that
where he had Schilling and all kinds of

1632
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:22,570
trouble,

1633
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,403
that's a bummer.

1634
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,950
That's a big victory for Shung
Tracy [inaudible] ankle man.

1635
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:28,180
He broke his foot or his ankle.

1636
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:29,050
Something's broken.

1637
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,741
No Shit.

1638
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:32,140
You throw the spreads that
has it happened all the time.

1639
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,033
Wow.

1640
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,251
Yeah.

1641
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:34,900
He's fucked shit.

1642
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,131
Yeah.

1643
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:35,790
If he's rapping.

1644
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,620
Yeah.

1645
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:36,870
Yeah.

1646
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:39,280
Year Rodriguez and the
first round is fine.

1647
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,121
That mother fucker.

1648
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:42,190
Fuck kid two rounds like that.

1649
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:43,150
Move in and shoot.

1650
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:43,661
I text you.

1651
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:45,820
You imagine that Kit's
champion from Mexico.

1652
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,360
What?

1653
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,380
With his personality and
his style get fuck yeah man.

1654
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,800
Dude texted and congrats

1655
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,320
to Joe Schilling.

1656
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,490
Yeah.

1657
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:57,870
Yeah.

1658
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,960
Here's a bad motherfucker,

1659
00:40:58,961 --> 00:40:59,111
dude.

1660
00:40:59,111 --> 00:41:00,130
He's so exciting.

1661
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,540
He's so versatile.

1662
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,463
His Jujitsu,

1663
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,420
everything is Jujitsu's nasty.

1664
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,190
His take down defense is excellent.

1665
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:06,820
Getting better.

1666
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,320
Yeah.

1667
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:07,440
It's,

1668
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,300
it's excellent for a guy to throw
his kicks like he does though.

1669
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,560
He's throwing wild shit all the time.

1670
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,970
Is that Jackson's now too?

1671
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,200
Is he tried to work on his wrestling?

1672
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,400
That's a good move.

1673
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,233
That's a good move.

1674
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,150
There's a bunch of like really
good high level camps right now,

1675
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,530
so it's a super times.

1676
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,550
Such a good time for MMA and guys
aren't sparring as much and got,

1677
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:27,761
you know,

1678
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:28,480
it's good.

1679
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,370
It's a great time for him.

1680
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:29,920
Yeah,

1681
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,780
it's a great time for two
oh five how excited is to,

1682
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:32,614
Oh fuck.

1683
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,730
It's MMA.

1684
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,410
N n you know,

1685
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,940
just the,

1686
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:38,930
not just the UFC,

1687
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:41,150
but even Beltour like the,

1688
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,550
like if you look at some
of the guys they have,

1689
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:46,550
like there's some talent
like all throughout,

1690
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:47,540
across an a May.

1691
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,310
Now the only thing I,

1692
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:49,630
here's,

1693
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,463
here's a problem.

1694
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,830
Who the fuck is fade or going to
fight to find some one to know?

1695
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,430
Dude,

1696
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,263
come on.

1697
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,080
I'm pretty sure they announced he's
fighting to want to know guy calm.

1698
00:41:59,090 --> 00:41:59,923
They reneged it.

1699
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:00,763
Yeah.

1700
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,850
No,

1701
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:02,900
I'm almost positive.

1702
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:03,411
I saw that.

1703
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:04,100
Oh God.

1704
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,420
This could be bro Science.

1705
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,850
This could be MMA scientists
at night be lying.

1706
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:08,870
Cause I left hand again.

1707
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,220
He dropped him with,

1708
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,780
but here's this big dude.

1709
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,500
Boom.

1710
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,640
That's right on the money.

1711
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:16,430
He caught him on the money
and then he rock going kid.

1712
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,330
He fought smart.

1713
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:18,170
They're covering up.

1714
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:18,351
Oh,

1715
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:21,560
he walked him a couple times
after that and that's it.

1716
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,970
Third round couldn't come out.

1717
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,833
Good for Shelly.

1718
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,063
Yeah.

1719
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,380
That's gotta be a giant
relief for him too.

1720
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:28,340
After that second round.

1721
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,183
Who was stuck around.

1722
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,350
That was scary.

1723
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,690
He showed a good chin though.

1724
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,690
Especially for a guy that got
knocked out in his last fight.

1725
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,830
See opponent would be s whatever,

1726
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,010
whatever the fuck that.

1727
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,000
Who's the opponent?

1728
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:41,740
No.

1729
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,500
Who she's Akihabara say's
record below that area.

1730
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:46,060
Hawaii.

1731
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,210
It make it was picked up on it.

1732
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,261
No,

1733
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:49,470
that's trolling.

1734
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:52,550
Keeping Gi deep is there trolling.

1735
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,820
That's the internet suddenly fucks MMA
fighting lesson that sing jai deep guy.

1736
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,160
That is a guy that on my message board,

1737
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,880
they joke around about him being
the big threat to Cain Velasquez.

1738
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:07,130
He's just like really
overweight Indian guy.

1739
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,300
It's a joke.

1740
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:09,440
This is a troll.

1741
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,370
The honey Dick.

1742
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,150
They're trolling.

1743
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,630
All right.

1744
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,463
It's the Internet.

1745
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,020
Tony.

1746
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,250
Somebody that role Aoki
sock was for reals.

1747
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,150
Soccer whales.

1748
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,000
He'll keep her sock robis for reals.

1749
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,720
I'll come on.

1750
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,321
I swear to God.

1751
00:43:21,321 --> 00:43:22,520
I thought Soccer Rama was done.

1752
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:22,761
Oh,

1753
00:43:22,761 --> 00:43:25,230
Kenny Florian was in Japan
and rolled with a oak.

1754
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:25,491
He was like,

1755
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:26,241
who are you fighting next?

1756
00:43:26,241 --> 00:43:26,690
And he said,

1757
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:27,523
Suck Rama.

1758
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:28,823
Kenny's like what?

1759
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:30,861
It's a bummer.

1760
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:31,040
Right?

1761
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,873
Well,

1762
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:35,090
here's a problem and
he'll can Aoki can strike,

1763
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:35,811
you know,

1764
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:36,021
I mean,

1765
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:37,310
soccer opposite bigger guy,

1766
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:37,890
but he okay.

1767
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:38,221
Strike,

1768
00:43:38,221 --> 00:43:39,020
he's not that bad.

1769
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,270
I think Sakharova has
so many miles on them.

1770
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:41,721
Dude.

1771
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:43,360
Aoki striking compared to soccer.

1772
00:43:43,361 --> 00:43:44,600
I right now he's fucking Joe.

1773
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:45,320
Shelley.

1774
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,153
Yeah.

1775
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:47,420
Ramos.

1776
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,790
He's taken so many fucking beatings.

1777
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,070
Moore's 10 braces.

1778
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:52,880
Yeah.

1779
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,180
Think if Aoki gets hold of one of
those old as ankles to rip it off,

1780
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:57,170
like tales from the crypt.

1781
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:57,980
Ooh.

1782
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,600
I think grappling wise,

1783
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:00,980
he's still very competent.

1784
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:01,820
Gratis,

1785
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,510
gratis.

1786
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,260
Did you see him fighting metamorris yeah.

1787
00:44:04,261 --> 00:44:04,970
Gets Hanzo.

1788
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:05,330
Yeah.

1789
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:06,230
But you know,

1790
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:08,590
he was able to go to a draw with Henzel.

1791
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,051
I agree.

1792
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:12,620
And handles a monster and
one of my favorite people
that ever grace this earth,

1793
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,910
however Aoki.

1794
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:14,251
That's,

1795
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:14,630
uh,

1796
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,321
that's some shit,

1797
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:15,740
man.

1798
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,030
As much smaller too.

1799
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:21,020
He was fought at lightweight where a
Sakharova fuck Conan his first UFC fight.

1800
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:21,320
True.

1801
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,520
Sacro has been through
some shit much miles,

1802
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:24,920
man.

1803
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,161
Dude,

1804
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:25,730
that fight,

1805
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:26,121
first of all,

1806
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,860
the Vandelay knock outs were horrible,

1807
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,143
horrific.

1808
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:33,390
And then the knockout that might've been
even worse as the Melvin Manhoef one.

1809
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,283
Oof.

1810
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,921
Yeah.

1811
00:44:36,921 --> 00:44:37,700
This is uh,

1812
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,690
an interesting fight.

1813
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,950
Shilling knocked him
down the left hand too.

1814
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:44,090
It's an interesting thing about Schilling
is I think it was a straight left.

1815
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:44,930
Um,

1816
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,180
Schilling fights pretty
good off both sides.

1817
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,261
Yeah.

1818
00:44:48,261 --> 00:44:49,660
He's a freak striking lifespan.

1819
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:50,690
Good fight man.

1820
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:51,524
It was a good fight.

1821
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:52,551
Interesting.

1822
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:53,540
It would have been interesting to see.

1823
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,190
I'm super happy for Joe.

1824
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:55,580
Hell yeah.

1825
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,470
As long as you get a win.

1826
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,060
If he's your friend who
gives a fuck how it happened,

1827
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,343
you know what I'm saying?

1828
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,393
Exactly.

1829
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,600
All right.

1830
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,530
I'm going to the comedy store.

1831
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:04,311
Boom.

1832
00:45:04,311 --> 00:45:07,190
Get it done down to round two fighter
and the kid fighter and the kid.

1833
00:45:07,191 --> 00:45:07,610

1841
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,553
