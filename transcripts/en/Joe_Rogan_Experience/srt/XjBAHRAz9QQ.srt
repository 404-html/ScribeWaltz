1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,640
So you require conflict
in order to be engaged.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,390
Yes.

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,370
You must have it now.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,031
Well,

6
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:12,810
I found one of the things that I've found
really fascinating about your show was

7
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:16,130
the episode on Indian Gurus.

8
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:16,680
Yes.

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,180
That was my favorite.

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:18,910
Really.

11
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,750
He's just so fucking bizarre.

12
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,040
The American physicist was
the most bizarre to me.

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,000
There was a for folks,

14
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,410
Mike,

15
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,330
that was a long time ago.

16
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,910
Mike from California.

17
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:31,650
Yeah.

18
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,250
Um,

19
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,083
there,

20
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,410
there was a guy,

21
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,440
Swami g's,

22
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,640
I'll you freak out to
Patty Satyananda Swami Gee,

23
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,990
what a you of those names.

24
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,161
Yeah.

25
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:43,140
The Indians have fantastic language.

26
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,270
Their names are amazing.

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,600
But there was this character
who is this a yoga master,

28
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,800
quasi spiritual leader,

29
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,643
whatever he is.

30
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,150
Um,

31
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,391
you know,

32
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:55,224
without judging.

33
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,590
And there's this guy named Mike who was
a Divo Tay who lived in this guy's off

34
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:03,450
Schrom I guess.

35
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:04,284
And Yeah.

36
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,440
Believed that this man could materialize
jewelry and objects and the story of

37
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:15,300
him stomping his foot down and a
50 pound note appeared in his hand.

38
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:16,134
Like,

39
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,940
this guy's a fucking physicist.

40
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,720
That's right.

41
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,070
Which is so strange.

42
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,210
That was a good one.

43
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,440
It was my favorite,

44
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,011
but my,

45
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:28,011
one of my favorite moments was you sitting
on the edge of the bed talking to him

46
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,110
and you asked him whether or not he said,

47
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:32,250
try not to take this the wrong way,

48
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:36,780
but did you have sadness
in your life before you,

49
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,640
before you met the sky?

50
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,641
And He,

51
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:42,170
um,

52
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,310
and he got angry.

53
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,950
He took it a myth and he
didn't like that question.

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,930
And um,

55
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,880
he said something like,

56
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,040
he said something like,

57
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,120
uh,

58
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,700
what are you asking me?

59
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,551
I'm like,

60
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:58,070
am I a burnout and burnout?

61
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,660
And his quote was a fascinating
because it was about fundamentalism.

62
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,751
Yeah.

63
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:01,761
Yeah.

64
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:01,850
He

65
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,420
says like,

66
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,380
I always say that,

67
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:03,590
uh,

68
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,900
having a breakdown is the,

69
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,220
is like the precursor to fundamentalism.

70
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,220
Decide he was going to
say that he had a break.

71
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:10,510
Yeah.

72
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,740
So I sort of went with the question,

73
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,000
but what he said,

74
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,580
I felt like he was setting me up for that,

75
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:18,860
but he didn't see himself
as a fundamentalist.

76
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,520
And I'm,

77
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,211
it was a really,

78
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:21,110
it was a misunderstanding.

79
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:22,590
I normally try and get into the,

80
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,250
the difficult questions
a little more gracefully.

81
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:28,250
And because I had misunderstood
what he was saying.

82
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,121
I don't think you did.

83
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:30,290
I slid into it a bit.

84
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,400
I really don't think he did.

85
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,720
I think he changed gears.

86
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,560
You think?

87
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:33,921
Yeah,

88
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,030
I think he was sort of that,

89
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:35,811
you know what happened?

90
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:38,300
Like the deep story there is that I spent,

91
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,980
that was a weird weekends days,

92
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:42,740
which was about 10 years ago
and I used to try and spend,

93
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,020
it was like a little rule of thumb.

94
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,970
I'd try and I'd find a contributor
who I could relate to the most.

95
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:49,520
Like you take something that
seemed really out of whack,

96
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,490
like something that on the face of it
you think that how could people really

97
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,320
think it's cool to move to Idaho and not
pay taxes and think the UN is going to

98
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:57,631
invite.

99
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:59,030
How could people really think?

100
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,190
Indian guru is going to
manifest Rolex watches.

101
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,280
They call them cities by meditating and
cure cancer by jamming on a keyboard.

102
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:08,920
Right.

103
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,390
And an old bon Tempe keyboard.

104
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,710
And so,

105
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,101
but the,

106
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:12,391
the,

107
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:15,220
the technique we used was to
try and find the most likable,

108
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,210
reasonable seeming person who
exemplified that belief system.

109
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,930
So you would,

110
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,611
it was like you,

111
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:20,861
you,

112
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:23,530
you take a weird sound
check but cost it normal.

113
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,800
Like cast it a person who's likable
and relatable when Mike was the guy we

114
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:29,140
thought and when you found that
guy and say that and I'll move in,

115
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,180
I'll spend a night with them.

116
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,990
It was like,

117
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,660
it was like to supposed to signal
my commitment to the story as well.

118
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,460
So in that story I spent the night,

119
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,610
uh,

120
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,290
Mike's Ashram and um,

121
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,460
but I,

122
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,450
they had very thin mattresses,

123
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:46,960
although I later found out there were
different thicknesses depending on how

124
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:47,800
committed you were,

125
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:51,310
you would choose a thinner mattress so
you can choose a thick when buying in

126
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:51,491
real,

127
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:53,580
I just found a thin one so I put it on.

128
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:57,610
I thought I had one of the worst nights
of sleep in my life and I woke up the

129
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,310
next morning kind of groggy and
as you are a offer night sleep,

130
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,140
not just I'm going to bad tempered,

131
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,210
but also just my ci
wasn't flowing right now,

132
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,810
wasn't in tune with what
was going on around me.

133
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,400
And so when he asks,

134
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:11,500
he said something about if you're,

135
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,101
you know,

136
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:12,351
uh,

137
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:12,640
if you,

138
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,620
you fundamentalist because
you've had a breakdown.

139
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,431
And I think,

140
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:16,830
oh he's saying he had a breakdown.

141
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,070
I think so.

142
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:19,450
Did you have some sadness in your life?

143
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:20,010
And then he,

144
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,280
he,

145
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:20,921
he kind of flipped.

146
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,480
Let's play that and you can find that.

147
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:23,530
You can find that Jamie,

148
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,520
it's that video that you just showed if
you back up about three or four minutes

149
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:29,550
before that find it is,

150
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:33,520
is you'll see Louie getting out of bed
and he looks very groggy and then he

151
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,160
communicates with this guy and they
have this sort of a weird breakdown.

152
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,750
That's also the one
where I try and call it.

153
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:41,890
Cause then the guru says he's a big
fan of Siegfried and Roy or David

154
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:41,891
Copperfield's.

155
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:42,670
They recover field.

156
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:42,820
Yeah.

157
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,820
He says he went to Vegas and I took it
as a kind of slightly very subtle coded

158
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,260
possible admission that he
takes an interest in magic
and therefore what he does

159
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:54,400
is it kind of conjuring.

160
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,691
So I sort of,

161
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:57,770
I was trying to edge towards
getting him to admit,

162
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,471
you know,

163
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:04,210
like we know that you can't make a
Rolex watch appear out of thin air.

164
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:04,780
Right.

165
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,980
And so why not just,

166
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,710
let's just get that out
there and admit that,

167
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,573
you know,

168
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,331
that's what you do.

169
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:12,340
But he's a guru so he
couldn't really admit it.

170
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:12,671
Yeah.

171
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:13,540
This is a,

172
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,823
it's like this

173
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,653
just

174
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,370
does foot cause here

175
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,550
he's working on a cosmic level.

176
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,601
Don't take this,

177
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,580
don't take this the wrong way.

178
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,480
Mind who,

179
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,690
was there any sadness in your life
before you came to see the Swami and

180
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:38,524
committed to him?

181
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,530
I'd always have a little saying,

182
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,070
fundamentalism is the aftermath
of a nervous breakdown.

183
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,050
You know,

184
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,640
when,

185
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,120
you know,

186
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,360
it's,

187
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,580
it's a little bit of course,

188
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,414
but

189
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,130
did you ever but

190
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,820
come up with that please?

191
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,161
Yeah,

192
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:58,401
no,

193
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,234
I don't know.

194
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,343
Um,

195
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,200
you know,

196
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,800
the drugs,

197
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,633
you know,

198
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,051
she paused this,

199
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:06,411
all this,

200
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:06,771
you know,

201
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:07,071
you know,

202
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:07,410
you know,

203
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:07,681
you know,

204
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:08,514
you know,

205
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,700
burn out and then he goes down.

206
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,450
Uh,

207
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:13,910
uh,

208
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,380
I think these are all towels.

209
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,240
I think he changed gears on you.

210
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,980
I really think his statement,

211
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:19,850
there's initial statement,

212
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:21,030
fundamentalism and,

213
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:23,030
and you know about nervous breakdowns.

214
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,210
I think that's what he's really saying.

215
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:25,820
Yeah,

216
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,570
I really do.

217
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,100
And then when you confront him on it,

218
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:29,660
he realizes he's on camera.

219
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,650
This is why the all the,

220
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:31,041
you know,

221
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:31,311
you know,

222
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:31,730
you know,

223
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,930
he's thinking too much.

224
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:36,050
He's trying to come up with a
way to spin that story in a,

225
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:36,884
in a better light.

226
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,480
He's not just free flowing,

227
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,770
what's going on in his mind.

228
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,670
He's dancing around the subject trying
to wrestle it into a more acceptable,

229
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,950
palatable flight deck.

230
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,130
Good.

231
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:45,751
I agree that,

232
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:47,610
but I think what I see my take on it,

233
00:06:47,611 --> 00:06:48,450
it's a,

234
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,523
he,

235
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,480
he's emotionally,

236
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,440
you know,

237
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,610
close to the surface and probably has
been through a lot of difficult things.

238
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,653
I,

239
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,081
I mean,

240
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:58,771
I know what I mean.

241
00:06:58,771 --> 00:06:58,920
I,

242
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,680
I getting dangerously close
to kind of diagnosing him,

243
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,440
uh,

244
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,181
in absentia.

245
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:04,230
But uh,

246
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,590
I,

247
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,610
and I think,

248
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,280
but I also think he's
trying to step outside it.

249
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,173
He's trying to say like,

250
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,020
I agree with you,

251
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:10,530
like,

252
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,580
but I'm not one of them.

253
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:11,821
Like,

254
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:14,710
I don't think he thinks that
he did have a breakdown.

255
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,040
Well,

256
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,721
it could be bold.

257
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:16,650
He's trying to play it off.

258
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,220
I mean,

259
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,440
I think maybe he was a lovely guy though.

260
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,900
He was from the bay area
happy it's doing it.

261
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,420
He seemed like a very nice guy,

262
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:25,310
which is one of the
interesting aspects of it.

263
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,840
He also seemed fairly intelligent,

264
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,110
but he also claimed to
be a total complete scan

265
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,510
dick.

266
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,871
But look,

267
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:32,231
you know,

268
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:32,680
Isaac,

269
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:32,981
I mean,

270
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:34,450
I don't want to go on a little lecture,

271
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:34,691
but you know,

272
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:36,580
Isaac Newton believed in Alchemy,

273
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,020
right?

274
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,390
Did it?

275
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,020
Yeah.

276
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,540
Hailey spent like the
last 20 years of his life.

277
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,680
Have you made probably the most
important scientific breakthroughs,

278
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:43,930
you know,

279
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,763
of all time,

280
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,690
the last 20 years of his life?

281
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,070
Kind of calculating the dimensions
of Noah's Ark based on biblical,

282
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:51,640
uh,

283
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,331
information.

284
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:52,481
I mean,

285
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:54,120
just Wacko stuff and,

286
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,810
and believed in the philosopher's stone,

287
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:56,644
in the idea of,

288
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,490
I mean,

289
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,460
so the,

290
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:58,981
I,

291
00:07:58,981 --> 00:07:59,221
I'm,

292
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:03,400
I'm constantly surprised and the ways in
which your rationality or what we could

293
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:03,970
think,

294
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,230
choose to think of his rationality,

295
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,390
can coexist with rationalities.

296
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,980
But I'm curious about the
fact that you enjoyed the,

297
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:11,350
the guru story.

298
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,640
Uh,

299
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:12,850
I,

300
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,090
I,

301
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,610
cause I look back at that and
it's not one that I would,

302
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,890
I feel is kind of one of my finest moment.

303
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,620
I loved it.

304
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,620
And I also love the part where you
met the woman who was his guru,

305
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,680
this female girl,

306
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:28,514
and she hugged,

307
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:28,901
right?

308
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:31,290
And I had it sort of
transcendental experience.

309
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,760
What happened there?

310
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:33,450
What was that?

311
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,410
Um,

312
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,730
it's hard to explain,

313
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:36,240
but I,

314
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,073
you know,

315
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,450
sometimes I think,

316
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:39,920
you know,

317
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,741
in a male way,

318
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:44,370
I'm not that connected to like
the deepest sources of my,

319
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,391
of my emotions.

320
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,224
So I,

321
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,420
I don't really know what it was,

322
00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:51,900
but I do think that being
hugged is a very simple,

323
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:52,920
and it's a physical act,

324
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:53,211
but it's,

325
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:53,370
uh,

326
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:53,701
you know,

327
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,090
it,

328
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:54,923
it,

329
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,900
it creates all kinds of
emotions inside of you.

330
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,810
And it just sort of
welled up from nowhere.

331
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,920
It was just really odd.

332
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,480
I don't really know exactly what happened.

333
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:03,931
Um,

334
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:06,150
I thought about that quite
a bit after I watched it.

335
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,350
And one of the things that I
took from it was the emotions.

336
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:14,820
And just the whole group of people
waiting in line to hug someone.

337
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:18,120
The anticipation of it and
the love that's in the air.

338
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:20,490
There's sort of this group
minded thing is going on

339
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,990
and there's a lot of music.

340
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:25,200
Loud music is a lot of people around.

341
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,360
There's a,

342
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,710
there's a,

343
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,830
there's a very heightened atmosphere.

344
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,560
And then she gave me a
sort of turbo hug too.

345
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:36,561
Like she gave me the executive platinum
card hog and I think they whispered to

346
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:37,231
her like,

347
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:38,340
give this guy,

348
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,270
you know,

349
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,103
the works.

350
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,900
And um,

351
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,280
so she hugged me for longer and she was
actually muttering things into my ear.

352
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,263
What was she saying?

353
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,631
I don't,

354
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,890
not words that I recognize,

355
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:50,724
but it was like,

356
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,563
he was sort of like,

357
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,853
ah

358
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,810
Ha,

359
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,643
they'd have it.

360
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,480
So it was comforting noises.

361
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,681
That's the word.

362
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:02,180
Poon job as the word for their language.

363
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,651
Well,

364
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:03,221
it's several levels.

365
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:08,221
It's UAA spoken Hindi or I'm
this or there's a few others too.

366
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,460
Too many to mention.

367
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,380
I would think that just the experience
itself of being around all those people

368
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:19,381
that were in this sort of dancing joyous
state in this long line to get to this

369
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:24,451
woman and she probably had some sincere
loving gesture towards everyone as well.

370
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,670
I mean imagine what it would be like to
be adored by so many people in such a

371
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:34,630
large group of people that are established
there to come see you and get in line

372
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:35,464
to hug you.

373
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,730
But then you did it and,

374
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,550
but you are really like move.

375
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,191
But it was,

376
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:39,550
yeah,

377
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,070
I mean I think as well I
was under a lot of pressure.

378
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,430
You know,

379
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,780
when I'm doing those stories,

380
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:49,830
I feel very pent up and I'm aware that
I have one chance to kind of get the

381
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:51,040
thing that I'm trying to get.

382
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,600
And Weed was one of those classic things
where I was supposed to hug her the day

383
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,780
before and then we took a crew
break and went for an Indian meal.

384
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,670
And then when we arrived at the,

385
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:04,240
the hugging tent that packed
up and left and I was like,

386
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,103
Oh my God,

387
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,220
we missed the hug.

388
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,260
And then it turned out
she was doing two nights,

389
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:11,230
she was doing like two dates in
that city because she was on tour,

390
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,850
like hugging her way around India.

391
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:13,930
So I was like,

392
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,140
oh,

393
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,711
we're fucked.

394
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:16,540
How are we going to get the hug now?

395
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,300
Just because like our crew
wanted a nice meal and,

396
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,433
and um,

397
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,273
uh,

398
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,210
and so we took it up,

399
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:23,080
I got to hear another night.

400
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,040
So it was,

401
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,040
it was this long lead up to getting the
hog and so it was a tightly wound coil

402
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:29,620
of,

403
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,580
of anxiety.

404
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:32,500
So when I finally got
there and had the hog,

405
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,550
it was several levels on which
I felt just sort of relieved.

406
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,961
Wow.

407
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:38,950
That's fascinating.

408
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,210
That's fascinating.

409
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:40,681
But you know,

410
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:41,251
religions,

411
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:41,491
you know,

412
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,324
it's one of lives,

413
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,000
the one in life's mysteries and um,

414
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,900
I'm trying to do a thing on Scientology
at the moment and that's a proven quiet,

415
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,320
quite a difficult road.

416
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:53,861
Well,

417
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:54,340
religion

418
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,173
is certainly,

419
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,820
it certainly is one of
life's great mysteries,

420
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:02,821
but I think there is also group states
of like-mindedness that I find quite

421
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:07,300
fascinating and you could
get them when the people,

422
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,160
I was at a military base once it was
a UFC fight for the troops and uh,

423
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,020
they sang the national anthem.

424
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:15,460
It's in the middle of the Iraq war.

425
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,020
And um,

426
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,761
the,

427
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:18,190
the,

428
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,730
the,

429
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,080
when they sang the national anthem,

430
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,220
the intensity and the feeling in the air,

431
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:24,511
the,

432
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,990
that patriotism,

433
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,321
the,

434
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,040
the,

435
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,380
just the emotions involved in,

436
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,250
you're dealing with thousands of people
in the audience who have lost loved

437
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,030
ones,

438
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,230
lost friends,

439
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,270
maybe been wounded themselves,

440
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:39,010
maybe taken lives themselves.

441
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:41,170
Many of them have shore
taken lives themselves.

442
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,820
And the,

443
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:43,041
the,

444
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,020
the palpable,

445
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,380
the patriotism and the
emotion and the invite.

446
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:51,340
And I am a person who was absolutely
against all of these wars,

447
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,350
whether it's the Iraq invasion,

448
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:54,520
the Afghanistan war.

449
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,660
I thought the whole thing was about money
and the whole thing was ill advised.

450
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:03,070
I thought that the idea of going in
for these supposed weapons of mass

451
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:05,320
destruction was incredibly transparent.

452
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:09,250
And then I thought that the government
and the military industrial complex was

453
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:13,840
capitalizing on a horrible
event in September 11th and
using that as an impetus

454
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,610
to go and invade these countries and,

455
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:15,860
and,

456
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,380
and take over,

457
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,693
you know,

458
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,540
resources.

459
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,930
But that moment when that thing was
happening and that person was singing the

460
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:27,191
national anthem,

461
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:30,670
it was a soldier that was singing the
national anthem and everyone was standing

462
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:33,970
there proud and the energy
in the air and they cheer.

463
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:35,090
When it was over,

464
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,240
you were ready to go to war.

465
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,021
I mean,

466
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:39,430
you are ready to support the troops.

467
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:41,980
You're ready to not just support
the troops but support the war.

468
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,900
You're ready to back them.

469
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,590
I mean,

470
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,900
there's this weird thing that happens,

471
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:50,780
these group minded sort
of states that should,

472
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,220
did you get into a kind of altered
consciousness in that moment?

473
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,850
I felt something for sure.

474
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,390
Did you feel I could
have easily cried if I,

475
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:01,630
if I coaxed myself into it or
if I entertain those thoughts,

476
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,353
the feeling,

477
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:03,970
I mean,

478
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,740
I was working at the time I was,

479
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:06,191
it was,

480
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:06,491
you know,

481
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:08,980
I was there for the ultimate
fighting championship.

482
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,031
And,

483
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:10,864
um,

484
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,011
but the,

485
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:13,600
the state of mind,

486
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:13,871
the,

487
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:14,111
the,

488
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:18,910
the group state was
fucking intense and it was,

489
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,260
it was palpable.

490
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:21,700
It was tangible.

491
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,960
It was in the air.

492
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,281
And you know,

493
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:28,780
this is coming from a person who I
believe that it's very important to have

494
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:29,381
military.

495
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:31,540
I believe that there are
bad people in the world.

496
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:35,890
I believe that there's
sometimes no other solutions.

497
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:36,700
I mean,

498
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,540
I don't believe in pacifism when you're
dealing with thugs and evil people in

499
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:40,810
the world.

500
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,643
I believe that.

501
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,210
But I also believe that there's good
people that are sent into bad situations

502
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,860
for all the wrong reasons,

503
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,660
by people that are trying to make money.

504
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,980
But in that state,

505
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,210
in that state was being there with all
those soldiers being there with all these

506
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:56,541
people,

507
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:56,841
man,

508
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:58,160
you got swept away by it.

509
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,650
He just kept carried away by this.

510
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,890
This intense feeling of patriotism is
an indescribable because you could feel

511
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:08,180
the emotions of those
people that are in that,

512
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,630
that,

513
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,463
that room.

514
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,390
And I wonder if that's similar to what
you were experiencing when you were

515
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:15,224
there.

516
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,320
I'm sure.

517
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,520
I'm sure it very close.

518
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:17,691
And,

519
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:17,901
and,

520
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:19,950
and it's not the only time when,

521
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,331
I mean,

522
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:25,440
if the only time I think I felt that
exact sort of emotion of as a sort of

523
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,600
whatever that was at a
religious transcendence.

524
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:28,800
But I've,

525
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,311
you know,

526
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:31,770
there's plenty of times
when you are around people.

527
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:32,400
I mean,

528
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,240
in a way,

529
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:37,320
a lot of the stories I do are about the
altered consciousness of being exposed

530
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:39,450
to people who believe things passionately.

531
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,580
And that slight sense of
Stockholm Syndrome that sets
in when you were there for

532
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:45,750
prolonged periods,

533
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,111
you know,

534
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,321
and,

535
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:46,850
and the,

536
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,730
and the weird,

537
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:48,564
um,

538
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,140
Cha did the change in
consciousness that takes place.

539
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:52,621
You know,

540
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:52,890
I,

541
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,230
I did a story where I
was with the Phelps clan,

542
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:56,550
the Westboro Baptist church,

543
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,280
and I was spent three weeks with them.

544
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,060
Uh,

545
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,410
if I did two different things,

546
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:02,520
but for the first one I was at for three,

547
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:04,530
which is called the most
hated family in America.

548
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,250
And it was really odd because
when you're inside there,

549
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,180
there are little compound in their,

550
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,290
in their castle imbibing there and
their doctrine around the clock,

551
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,290
stuff that seems really weird and hateful
on the outside starts to seem mundane.

552
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,490
You know,

553
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,290
you're still able to step
outside of their lives.

554
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,030
I'm here to do a job and this is wrong.

555
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:28,130
But you,

556
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,071
you get a nice,

557
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:29,850
the ties,

558
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:30,480
your mind,

559
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,610
your mind starts to get influenced.

560
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:33,210
It's really

561
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:33,720
strange.

562
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,950
I would imagine it is.

563
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:35,280
Um,

564
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,230
I've found the Phelps one very fascinating
because of the one guy that came

565
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:43,980
there to film a documentary on
them and then became one of them.

566
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,320
He joined up Steve.

567
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:45,471
Yeah,

568
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,850
he's very high up there now.

569
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,260
Steve,

570
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,651
he's,

571
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:49,520
and his daughter,

572
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:49,940
uh,

573
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,773
left.

574
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:51,963
Um,

575
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,000
a couple of years ago we went back and
did a followup because a couple of the

576
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:58,190
people we featured in
the first one then left.

577
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,780
But Steve almost,

578
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,870
you could argue by dint of having been
born outside the church was compensating

579
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,090
by being even more hardcore cause
he was the fiercest and the most,

580
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:11,924
um,

581
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,070
in conversation.

582
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,980
He was the hardest and the most,

583
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:16,814
um,

584
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,740
the most abusive.

585
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:21,350
I get most verbally full of bile.

586
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,450
And he also,

587
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:25,300
when you questioned
anything that he was saying,

588
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:26,410
what starting salting you.

589
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,070
Yeah,

590
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:27,431
yeah.

591
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:31,180
And aggressively and salting you and
I found that fascinating as well.

592
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:33,490
It wasn't just that you
could have questions.

593
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,181
It was that,

594
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:35,170
what do you fucking idiot.

595
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,060
It was like immediately
this aggressive sort of,

596
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:38,420
he

597
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,830
told me I was the most,

598
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,390
I can't remember the phrase he said,

599
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:44,930
it sound like the most iniquitous are
the most evil man in the history of the

600
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,240
earth or one of the three most evil men.

601
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:47,781
He said,

602
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:49,070
you're right up there with punches.

603
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,430
Like I was one of the three
most evil men of all time,

604
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:53,590
like,

605
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,880
you know,

606
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,930
way beyond Hitler.

607
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,090
And the reason was,

608
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,710
the reason was because I'd
been exposed to the teachings,

609
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:05,220
like I'd been given a special opportunity.

610
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:10,221
Like I was blessed beyond measure because
I had been exposed for three weeks to

611
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:15,681
the pure teachings of the only
people preaching salvation on earth.

612
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,140
And having seen that
and still rejected it,

613
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,760
then that put me way beyond the Pale.

614
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,070
I found it incredibly fascinating.

615
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:31,071
How effective of a guy who sucks
at speaking is at running a cop.

616
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,660
Like he's a terrible orator.

617
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,450
He's not like this
really charismatic ramps.

618
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:37,284
The main guy.

619
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,310
He's very old now.

620
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:40,440
Like he's in his time.

621
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:40,890
He could,

622
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,640
he could do it.

623
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,331
I thought he was,

624
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,800
I think you're being a little unfair.

625
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,390
You remember the bit where he says,

626
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:45,991
I'm going to eat.

627
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,370
You can eat your babies.

628
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,361
Like he,

629
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,140
he's still,

630
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,330
he's very old and,

631
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,690
and kind of decrepit,

632
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:54,690
but he still cranks it up and he goes,

633
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,470
you're going to eight.

634
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,550
You're made A's.

635
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,301
See,

636
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:58,170
I don't agree.

637
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:58,901
I follow.

638
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:00,030
So one note,

639
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,230
it was like death metal.

640
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,380
You can eat.

641
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,270
It's terrible.

642
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,011
I mean,

643
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,180
it was just so obvious.

644
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:06,490
I,

645
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,830
it's just there.

646
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:08,390
There's,

647
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,410
who do you like Billy Graham?

648
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,480
Like what preaching style do you prefer?

649
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,430
A Sam Kinison this is my favorite.

650
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,250
Um,

651
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:15,820
I,

652
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,400
I just think that there are people
who are better at it than Phelps.

653
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,430
Phelps is so negative and so abrasive.

654
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,350
I think there's almost his,

655
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,110
he's so believably evil bill,

656
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:30,210
he starts dearly beloved.

657
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,530
He did has a slow bill,

658
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:32,364
right?

659
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,290
And then he ramps it up and then he get,

660
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,124
he hits his,

661
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,860
his kind of power chorus,

662
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,580
if you can eat your babies.

663
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,230
I think there's something when someone's
unbelievably evil and aggressive where

664
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,080
you don't want them to be angry at you.

665
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:51,410
So you're willing to sort of like bend
your mind to what they're saying and

666
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,640
accept it and allow it in.

667
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,040
And that's what I felt watching that guy.

668
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,330
And I've seen that in him before and
in his speeches I've tried to sort of

669
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:02,560
rationalize or understand
what's going on when,

670
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:03,241
when he talks,

671
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:03,571
why,

672
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,610
when anybody gets sucked
into all this evil,

673
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:07,350
hateful talk and not question it.

674
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,430
But I think it's,

675
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:12,420
he's so over the top and so aggressive
that he's frightening to people.

676
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,930
Like when you sat down with them
and talk to them about the thing.

677
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,800
I mean by and large,

678
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,480
they don't really make converts.

679
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:19,291
They make a few,

680
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,450
but he's not trying to recruit,

681
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,410
um,

682
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,340
new personnel.

683
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:23,881
If anything,

684
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:24,720
it's the opposite.

685
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,390
They re they view it as a,

686
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,583
um,

687
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:33,590
as a confirmation of the holy status
and of their salvation that they're

688
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,470
rejected because there's some verse
somewhere in the Bible saying,

689
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:41,310
you will be hated of men and
people will throw things at you.

690
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:42,510
It's somewhere in the Bible.

691
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,180
And so every time someone
says you're full of it,

692
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:45,961
you're scum,

693
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:46,830
we hate you.

694
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,670
That what they hear is,

695
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:49,151
yes,

696
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:49,870
we are,

697
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,830
we're saved.

698
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,840
So and so when he,

699
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:53,260
um,

700
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,590
and he,

701
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,940
so like 90% of the people in there were
born into it and a family members and in

702
00:20:57,941 --> 00:20:59,080
fact they Lou,

703
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:01,480
they hemorrhage membership constantly.

704
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,070
They kick people out.

705
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,390
So when he's preaching,

706
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:05,410
he's not thinking,

707
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,530
how do I get new new followers?

708
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,861
Well,

709
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:10,570
I'm not saying that he's thinking that.

710
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,830
I'm wondering the effectiveness of
retaining anyone out of tickets even.

711
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,700
Well there I guess there is
the main effectiveness is that,

712
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,583
um,

713
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,333
I don't know what it,

714
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:21,590
well,

715
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,890
you would know obviously much more than I,

716
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:28,870
you were there for three weeks deeply
embedded into that organization.

717
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,070
He hated me.

718
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,451
Gramps did.

719
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:34,000
And he was one of the few times where
you try and do an interview with someone

720
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,670
who clearly can't stand you.

721
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,250
And I did an,

722
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,440
I said something like,

723
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:39,601
how,

724
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:43,750
how can you really believe that there's
no like even if you accept that what you

725
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:44,770
say is true,

726
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,451
you know that position is,

727
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:50,530
there is no other church in the
world that is preaching the doctrine.

728
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:50,711
I said,

729
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:51,700
how would you even know?

730
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,900
Like there could be some tiny church in
Nigeria that's preaching the exact same

731
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:56,734
message.

732
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,690
How would you know?

733
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,451
You wouldn't even know.

734
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,010
He goes and he says,

735
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:00,141
oh,

736
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:01,150
I know about them.

737
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:01,961
And I asked another question.

738
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:03,920
It goes asked and answered and I also,

739
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:05,890
and another because asked an
answer and he just kept saying,

740
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,880
Austin answered,

741
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,770
which is a legal term.

742
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,060
I mean,

743
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,893
you know,

744
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,793
what do you do?

745
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,431
What did you do?

746
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,410
Then there's nothing you could chuck.

747
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,870
He's the epitome of a close minded person.

748
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,810
I mean he is closed minded,

749
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,740
not just that,

750
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:25,570
but this arrogant assumption that he's
the man with the word of God and that it

751
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:28,630
comes out of this angry
old fuckheads face.

752
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,231
You know,

753
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:29,411
it's,

754
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:29,711
it's a,

755
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:33,460
it's an amazing thing that this guy
is able to put together this group.

756
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,031
I mean,

757
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:34,720
I just,

758
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,570
this is the moment where he sat
down and talked to this guy,

759
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,331
you know,

760
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:38,650
it was,

761
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,450
how long have you been with him by then?

762
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,003
Thickness was,

763
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:42,761
I'm trying to think.

764
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:43,420
It was the end of it.

765
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,800
We made three trips each of a week.

766
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,390
This was the second trip last day.

767
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,940
If you had just a little
knowledge of the Bible,

768
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:54,410
you will know that what you
just said is stupidity in Spain.

769
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,760
I don't know how to deal
with a question like that.

770
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:58,710
Yes,

771
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,590
we just took down.

772
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,643
Sorry.

773
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,870
You've got the duty to know
the Bible as well as I do.

774
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,883
Why?

775
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,010
Because you are human beings called
God Almighty major and got all my,

776
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:11,320
are going to send your ass to hell.

777
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,970
Is it accurate to say that you regard
the Westboro Baptist church is the only

778
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:19,520
church giving biblical
preaching according to the word?

779
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,483
No.

780
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,840
The answer your question is yeah,

781
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,351
no,

782
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:24,370
it was five minutes.

783
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:24,971
Well,

784
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,380
but I already talked to them.

785
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,120
So there's three left.

786
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,170
Um,

787
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,510
the real fucking shitty,

788
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,130
nasty preaching that is according
to the word of God is fancy.

789
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,420
Ashton answered next question.

790
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,990
As far as your concerned.

791
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,850
We got it.

792
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,683
Yeah.

793
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,400
I mean this is angry shitty man

794
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,070
who's able to get a bunch
of people to listen to him.

795
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,450
My,

796
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,630
he gets his five kids,

797
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,430
his kids and his grandkids.

798
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:52,541
Well,

799
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:53,570
how many people were there?

800
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,870
It seems like there was
a little 20 or 30 or 90.

801
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,290
Okay.

802
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:57,950
That's hip hop.

803
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,131
Yeah.

804
00:23:58,131 --> 00:23:58,790
He had 11.

805
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,480
Not yet.

806
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,890
I think I want to get this right.

807
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:02,540
I think it was like 12 kids,

808
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:07,541
but for them had left the church and
each of them had had quite a few kids.

809
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,181
But I think,

810
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:12,014
um,

811
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,390
I think if you're an EGOMANIAC,

812
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,313
number one,

813
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:15,981
number two,

814
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:20,981
if whatever reason you cleave to a certain
kind of dogmatic religious outlook is

815
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:24,190
probably not that difficult to,

816
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:24,590
to,

817
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,220
to run,

818
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,120
to have a cult.

819
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:27,991
Unfortunate.

820
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:28,830
But I think you're right.

821
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,730
You know,

822
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,511
it's shocking.

823
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:31,330
But I think you're right.

824
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:31,510
I've,

825
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:35,280
I've often said that all you have to
do is speak confidently and clearly and

826
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,290
most people would be like,

827
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,860
I can't.

828
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,230
Yeah.

829
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,990
And have no compunction about saying that
you speak the word of God or whatever

830
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:42,450
it is.

831
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,650
That's really all you have to do,

832
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:43,951
right?

833
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:45,390
You have to be the guy with the answers.

834
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,570
You have to be the guy that absolutely
not just the answers like as a human,

835
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:50,280
but the answer is from above from it.

836
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:50,661
I mean,

837
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:54,000
have you read the new Manson book then
you Charles Manson Book by Jeff Gwyn?

838
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,040
It came out last year.

839
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,461
No,

840
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:58,010
I try not to read anything
that comes out about Manson.

841
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:58,990
Uh,

842
00:24:58,990 --> 00:24:59,190
I'll,

843
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,410
I'll ask you why in a second.

844
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:01,760
But when you read it,

845
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:02,594
it's like,

846
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,071
Oh my word.

847
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:07,970
You just have to be kind of come out
with a few kind of riddles that you've

848
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:12,971
learned from street pimps and people
fall into your lap or so it would seem,

849
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,750
you made me,

850
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,771
I ain't sure.

851
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,060
Garbage man.

852
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,160
He people made me,

853
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,110
I'm your product.

854
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,420
All that fucking maniacal shit.

855
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,600
I think that that guy's the
Bob hope of serial killers.

856
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,381
You know,

857
00:25:28,381 --> 00:25:31,650
cause Bob hope was a comedian that
never really made anybody that in my

858
00:25:31,651 --> 00:25:32,580
generation laugh.

859
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:32,821
Like,

860
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:34,290
we always knew him as a comedian,

861
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:36,600
but it's like just really wasn't funny.

862
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,820
Manson was never scary to me.

863
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,330
Like there's some real serial killers
that we're fucking terrifying.

864
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,860
But when you think of serial killers,

865
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:45,390
it's always Manson.

866
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,430
Manson Manson is the guy,

867
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:48,270
the crazy guy,

868
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:49,140
the wild guy.

869
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,210
Cause he carved a fucking
swastika in his head.

870
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:52,030
But if you,

871
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,340
I mean Henry Lee Lucas,

872
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,240
the guy from that,

873
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,290
they made that movie about him.

874
00:25:55,291 --> 00:26:00,291
Henry Portrait of a serial
killer allegedly killed
somewhere around 60 people,

875
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:01,651
you know,

876
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:03,420
and I was with medicine.

877
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:03,830
The,

878
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,580
I think the reason people
are fascinated with medicine,

879
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,200
it's cause he didn't kill right?

880
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,020
He got other people to
yas because he got the,

881
00:26:10,021 --> 00:26:10,460
the,

882
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,760
the children that he,

883
00:26:11,761 --> 00:26:12,090
uh,

884
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,550
he sent them out of Tex
Watson was his big killer,

885
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:15,000
right?

886
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,180
Tech who's become a born again Christian.

887
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:19,110
And I think you're right.

888
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:21,570
It's children's books or
something fucking creepy.

889
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,060
That,

890
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,670
and you know what?

891
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,460
A number of them still believe,

892
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,900
you know that Charles,

893
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,530
that Charlie's still are of course,

894
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,880
otherwise they're idiots.

895
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:31,260
Okay.
