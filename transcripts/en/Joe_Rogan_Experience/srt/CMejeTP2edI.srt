1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,220
Boom,
yes,

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,180
boom.
With live.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,380
What's up brother?
How are you man?

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,230
How are you?
Joe?

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,400
You got a little pocket hankie there,
but I'll tell you,

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,040
so I'll tell you why I wear a pocket 
square please,

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,260
because if you don't wear a pocket 
square,

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,650
you have the appearance that you've been
squeezed into a sports jacket or a suit 

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,560
for conventional reasons that your mom 
put you in there or off the church or 

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,500
something.
We got to the office.

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,710
As soon as you put a pocket square in 
there,

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,560
you own the jacket if your idea and not 
someone else's idea.

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,150
Whoo

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,410
dude.
You're thinking several steps ahead.

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,480
I like it.
We'll get to get into this outage.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,780
We we're going to get into this.
Well,

17
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:53,781
we were talking before the podcast about
these press junkets and about how you 

18
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:56,220
entertain yourself by forcing yourself 
to use a certain word.

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,420
Yeah,
the danger.

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,660
The.
The worst thing in the film business is 

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,850
press junkets and as you were saying,
that rather ineffective and that's my 

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,241
suspicion too.
They're not that also inefficient and 

23
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:11,330
ineffective because you sit in the 
chair,

24
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:14,420
someone comes in and they ask you a 
question,

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,090
why,
how,

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,390
how good an actor is David Beckman is 
isn't on independence or whatever it is,

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,750
and you answer it and some facile 
fashion.

28
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,220
And on the full time you asked answer 
that question,

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,540
your starting to Swat flies that aren't 
there.

30
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,140
You're starting to go mad.
So what happens is you have to play 

31
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,391
games with yourself so you get someone 
on the side to throw different words 

32
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,120
that you like valued in area and,
or Marissa militude.

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,840
And then that keeps you occupied because
you're thinking when someone asks me 

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,291
about Beckman,
his underpants have somehow got a stick 

35
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:50,930
in a verisimilitude and I'll tell you,
it's not easy.

36
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,330
And your answers become very creative.

37
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:59,190
Did they ask someone to be sincere and 
asked the same questions over and over 

38
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,250
and over again to them like they're half
people.

39
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:03,130
Keep filing in.
A new person comes in and as I us.

40
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:05,860
So tell us about this film and how did 
this get started?

41
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,500
And so who,
whose idea was it?

42
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,290
So,
um,

43
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,140
I sort of film jumbled medics caliber in
about 1990 and uh,

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,200
I was an impressionable young man of 10 
and it was the first light knights in 

45
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:25,631
shining armor film I ever spoke to me.
I wasn't particularly interested in 

46
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:25,631
Errol Flynn,
uh,

47
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,970
or any inclination that they did in the 
fifties in the Shell Nhra.

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,570
But John Boorman's one was rather good.
He's very aggressive and no one spoke to

49
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,760
one another.
They will shout it at one another.

50
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,140
So it took some time before you realize 
that's why it was so intense.

51
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,100
It's quite camp.
So it had this sort of weird 

52
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,191
juxtaposition of being camp yet 
simultaneously aggressive and you know,

53
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,290
they had a budget of $25 and the visual 
effects and lots of very shiny 19th 

54
00:02:57,471 --> 00:03:02,471
century armor.
And it made a real impression on me 

55
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,840
because it was,
it was a voice,

56
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,850
it was a creative voice.

57
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,620
So I made an impression on me and then 
somewhere in the attic of my mind,

58
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:16,621
I relegate it until the point where I 
had enough creative ideas in my 

59
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:18,550
reservoir to bring it forward to make a 
film.

60
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:23,551
And then someone gave me money and 
warner brothers wanted to make it and 

61
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:23,830
Yada Yada Yada.
And then it was the challenge,

62
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:28,831
I suppose,
of trying to take us to join into this 

63
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:31,720
world,
the fantasy epic fantasy,

64
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,710
medieval he lord of the Rings,
Econ of a world,

65
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,020
and it's completely out of my 
wheelhouse.

66
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,530
So I find the challenge provocative and 
exciting as well.

67
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,810
That's a fascinating era or a genre,
you know,

68
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:48,620
the fascinating world of fantasy,
you know,

69
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:51,620
nights and swords and bows and arrows 
and that,

70
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,670
that realm for whatever reason,
has been intoxicating to people for a 

71
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:56,670
long time.

72
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,460
Yeah.
It's an archetype.

73
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,090
So you're interested in farm and you're 
interested in nurses.

74
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,710
Um,
you're interested in the superheroes 

75
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,730
obviously.
I mean,

76
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,760
arguably Arthur was the first superhero 
because he's the guy that extracts the 

77
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:11,760
sword.
And Gallup,

78
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,740
we can do all sorts of wondrous things.
And this myth is 1200 years old,

79
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,380
1400 years old.
And it's as relevant today as it was 

80
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:28,321
then.
But because it's an archetype that 

81
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:29,020
somehow kids the dress up as firemen,
policemen,

82
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:32,320
soldiers or nights.
So we,

83
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,520
it's almost like we relived it.
It's like an outfit that we wore 1200 

84
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,540
years ago,
so you feel familiar in it.

85
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,400
Yeah.
It's just.

86
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:47,401
It's fascinating that one genre,
that one sort of archetype is just 

87
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:48,000
locked into the site.

88
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,760
Give people.
Yeah.

89
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,440
It's,
it's,

90
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,660
it's there,
isn't it?

91
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,900
The other thing about it,
which is quite fun,

92
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,020
is you can take these kind of mystical 
rides into metaphor so you can symbolize

93
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,360
things with 300,
four elephants,

94
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,720
which you can't do in some version of a 
realistic world.

95
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,540
So it becomes.
You have broad poetic license to take 

96
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,980
liberties are using CGI in this movie.
A lot of it.

97
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:16,790
Yeah.
Wow.

98
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,020
What's that like?
I'm boring,

99
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:24,260
but creative is three years.
The bank,

100
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:27,770
this movie I'm used to making movies 
that take three months to write,

101
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,360
three years,
three years.

102
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,420
Wow.
Three months to write from beginning to 

103
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:34,420
end.
Southern lot snatch was three months,

104
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,590
six weeks to shoot,
two months to edit.

105
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,440
So it's was three months to do the whole
thing or to write it,

106
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,100
to write it and to shoot it.
The whole thing from the beginning to 

107
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,260
the way getting to the end of six 
months.

108
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,890
Oh Wow.
And then three months safer editing.

109
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,530
So you wrapped and packed in nine 
months,

110
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:52,040
10 months.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,890
So this is a totally different kind of 
commitment as far as your and

112
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,130
yeah,
if I really knew what I was getting 

113
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,661
into,
I would have asked for double bubble on 

114
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:06,380
the salary because you saw,
I think it could be a year and a half is

115
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:10,850
not a three years.
Like when you play on a movie like this,

116
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,860
a big epic movie.
Do you have an actual schedule of when 

117
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,540
you think it's going to begin and when 
it's going to end or do you do,

118
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:22,541
but you know the terrain filmmaking has 
changed exponentially.

119
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:28,601
Like everything with technology.
So what was pertinent last year is not 

120
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:31,760
pertinent in this year.
So release dates are a real dog.

121
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,330
So we had a release date which was 
projected a couple of years from when 

122
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,951
you start the babies.
So get right is checkmate the movie 

123
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:42,320
you're coming out in?
It was.

124
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,970
We were supposed to come out and exactly
a year ago,

125
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,720
but then what happens is if you're not a
branded movie,

126
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,420
you get elbowed off that day.

127
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,520
You know,
Star Wars or something will come along 

128
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,630
and then you don't get to compete 
without walls,

129
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,030
so you got to move because you can't 
compete,

130
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,120
so you got a very crowded market with 
lots of brands.

131
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,150
Now this isn't something that we used to
suffer because everyone was equal going 

132
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:13,061
into the equation.
You give yourself the advantage of 

133
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:13,400
having a movie star or something,
but that doesn't exist anymore.

134
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:17,510
What exists now is the brand is the big 
brother,

135
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,020
so he comes muscling and bullies his way
into a weekend and that's why you can't 

136
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,491
really get new films breaking through 
because there was occupy those weekends 

137
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:31,711
are already occupied,
so trying to break through is a real 

138
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:34,390
real struggle.
We had to wait a year for a day and the 

139
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,821
date that were coming out on one weekend
after guardians now got into be vast hit

140
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,140
and it's very dangerous being within the
parameters of a of a big movie.

141
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,660
That's a really interesting thing that 
only movies have to go through these 

142
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:49,660
days,
right?

143
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,120
I mean,
it's one of the rare things where people

144
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:53,960
are getting out and going to see 
something that's been made together in a

145
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:55,380
group.
You know that you're,

146
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:58,490
you're watching media like it's not a 
live performance.

147
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:02,780
It's something that's been created and 
it's going to press play at 8:00

148
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,780
PM on Friday night and everybody's going
to go to see it and you got to get as 

149
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:07,780
many of those people together as you 
can.

150
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,090
It's one of the rare things like that.
Yeah,

151
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,960
and it's becoming more polarized so it 
means more now,

152
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,520
so you're opening weekend.
Everything is about.

153
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:18,530
They know what you're going to make by 
Thursday evening,

154
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,760
right?
You're coming.

155
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,790
You're supposed to be coming out on 
Friday and everyone knows what you have 

156
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,790
to make.
By Sunday night on a Thursday evening,

157
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,860
there's enough clever people out there 
tapping into clever little boxes and 

158
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,850
computer says that,
that the data,

159
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,520
and they're seldom wrong now.

160
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,520
That never used to be the case.
Used to come out and films will get 

161
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,520
discovered.
You said platform,

162
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,340
you start small,
go big.

163
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:45,341
That sort of nonsense.
Now you just got to come out bold 

164
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:45,440
swinging,
and if you don't come out ball swing and

165
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,440
people get very upset and they think 
that this is a failure,

166
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:51,830
it hasn't lived up to expectations,
even if it's a creative success,

167
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,150
nobody likes it.
It's,

168
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:53,870
well,
you know,

169
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:54,920
there's a bit of that,
you know,

170
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,000
there's,
there is an accepted set,

171
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,480
uh,
movies,

172
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:00,090
good movies,
good movies find their own way,

173
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,120
usually in the end anyway,
but the financial aspect has become 

174
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,810
polarized.
It's too significant of a component in 

175
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,370
the equation because,
you know,

176
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,540
it's an art form,
right?

177
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,370
At the end of the day,
it's entertainment and an art form.

178
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:22,371
And somehow you want to unify,
reconcile that.

179
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,230
So because they're essentially 
different,

180
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,980
reconcile those,
put it in a nice little package.

181
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,190
So you put it in a pill with a sweet 
wrapper around it and then you got both 

182
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,760
and then you should be happy.
You should have the substance and you 

183
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,430
should have the flavor.
Um,

184
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,690
but then now the focus is all on the 
flavor and not in the substance.

185
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,330
And that's result orientated.
So you movie comes out and they go,

186
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,900
what am I not slow down,
son?

187
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,350
What's the movie line?
The question first of all should be 

188
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,350
what's the movie like rather than what 
did it mean?

189
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,440
And it,
it's just,

190
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,500
it's become too competitive and to 
comparative financially and I love a 

191
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,220
dollar bill and I like things that 
successful,

192
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,780
but it has to be secondary to what's 
primary and primary is.

193
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,130
What's it like creatively?

194
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,010
Well,
a film like,

195
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,540
no,
not to shit on it,

196
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,630
but fast and furious.
All I heard about was how much money you

197
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:19,040
made.
That's all you hear.

198
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,010
It's like the big story,
the big fast and the furious opening box

199
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:23,480
office.
Hundreds of millions of dollars.

200
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,550
All you see is like,
it's going to make a billion dollars.

201
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,940
Why don't you give a fuck?
Why does anybody who's watching that 

202
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:30,940
give a fuck?
You're not gonna get any of that money.

203
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,260
Why is it so appealing that this movie 
is made a billion dollars?

204
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,890
Because it's comparative and it's 
competitive and it's why two people in 

205
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:38,890
the audience

206
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,710
because it's voyeuristic.
Voyeuristic.

207
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,180
Yeah.
So you can.

208
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,030
It's like spectator sport.
Who's the winner?

209
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:51,210
Right.
You don't really care about how they 

210
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,301
won.
You just care about the fact that they 

211
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:54,301
did when

212
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:57,330
or like a floyd mayweather.
You want to find out how much money he 

213
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:57,330
made.
He made $200,000,000

214
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:57,790
at five.
Oo.

215
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,770
People get excited about it.
It's an extra element.

216
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,980
Yeah.
There is a sort of,

217
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:07,981
um,
for carious life that people can have 

218
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:12,120
through sports stars,
celebrities and success if they feel 

219
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,601
somehow related to or they went on the 
opening weekend or they are invested in 

220
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,020
that.
If it's successful,

221
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,900
then somehow proliferate.
I'm successful.

222
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,460
Yeah.
That gets weird,

223
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:22,600
right?
It does get weird.

224
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:24,260
Yeah.
It's the

225
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:29,270
business of movies is a very,
very strange business because you are a 

226
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,840
creative business,
but you're also a business enterprise.

227
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:35,841
I mean you're,
you're a financial business and when 

228
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:36,930
know when it's a guy like you,
like your movies have a certain flavor,

229
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:41,931
you know,
like you start off with lock stock and 

230
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:42,120
two smoking barrels.
Like that movie has a flavor to it.

231
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,300
And then your other films,
like people want to go to see that kind 

232
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,021
of flavor from your film.
Do you feel like pressure in that 

233
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:51,510
regard,
like to live up to those expectations or

234
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,400
to conform to these ideas people have of
your movies?

235
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,700
Yes and no.
Yes and no.

236
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
It depends what mood you catch me in,
right?

237
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:04,950
Um,
I like what I do and I'm going to do it 

238
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,741
anyway.
I just liked it very much when people 

239
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:07,741
pay me to do it and give me the money to
go do it.

240
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,200
So I don't mind the financial aspect of 
it.

241
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:14,950
I don't mind films having to compete.
I what I'm,

242
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,430
what I'm after is a reconciliation and 
as I say,

243
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,610
the primary components,
you'd be on the quality of the work.

244
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,060
That should be what's primary,
but I don't begrudge films being 

245
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,060
successful.
I'd like them to be successful.

246
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,531
I liked the competitive element,
but sometimes when you're talking with 

247
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:34,351
executives,
you realize my priorities are on the 

248
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:39,511
wrong thing here in the end it is a 
creative medium and that is what has to 

249
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:40,930
be primary.
Do they get in the way of a guy like you

250
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:41,200
though?

251
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Like I would imagine the guy like you,
they give you a certain amount of 

252
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,480
leeway,
they give you all the leeway.

253
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,740
That's beautiful.
Yeah,

254
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,440
and I,
I,

255
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,470
my experience with studios will be very 
positive and they tried to encourage 

256
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,400
your hopefully what is your individual 
idiosyncrasies?

257
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,220
They want you to put your imprint upon 
the work and they've been nothing but 

258
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,930
encouraging in that sense,
but you know,

259
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:09,390
people betray their agendas whilst 
you're in light conversation or they 

260
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,501
portray their priorities.
So you want to trust the man because 

261
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:17,500
he's a man of substance and to a degree,
independence.

262
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,480
So he's not looking to me to find 
himself through me.

263
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,540
So you're not asking me to tell you who 
you are.

264
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,600
And that's the ongoing battle of live,
right?

265
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:33,160
Where will asking other people to tell 
us who we are and independence from.

266
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:34,840
That is a man that can be trusted.

267
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,380
I don't want anything from you and 
thereby I can be kind to you because I 

268
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,910
don't need to manipulate you.
You're no longer a crutch,

269
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,480
right?
So it's got to be very difficult when 

270
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,480
you're in business.
When someone like that,

271
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,870
especially like an executive,
some slick character in a fine suit to 

272
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,880
find out exactly what is real motives 
really are than never in find suits.

273
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,120
Never,
never.

274
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,170
They dress in appalling suits.
Really?

275
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,770
Yeah.
I mean business is never encourage.

276
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,690
Find suits.
The pocket squares,

277
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,170
occasionally you find the token pocket 
square,

278
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:09,640
but you can tell their heart's not in 
it.

279
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,140
The wife stuck it in there because she's
so someone on tv that Adam razzle dazzle

280
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:19,270
about them and they thought,
oh,

281
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:21,910
I quite fancy model man wearing them and
they stick it in.

282
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:24,970
The old man's bit embarrassed about it 
and tries to squeeze out of the way.

283
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,630
Suits are a thing.
The death of the suit.

284
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,810
It was the death of the suit.
Was the attitude toward ongoing.

285
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,030
No,
no,

286
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,730
go.
Yeah,

287
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,580
we'll put a tie on and I don't want us 
to cow.

288
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,460
That's how I feel,
but that's what's happened.

289
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,400
We've been brainwashed to not dress line
gentlemen,

290
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,830
but I see a guy like you and I say 
that's appealing.

291
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,100
Like look how you're dressed and you're 
in a conservative suit.

292
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,290
This is a nice,

293
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,470
like I'm sure you could wear any suit 
you wanted,

294
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,710
but you chose assert that has a certain 
look to it.

295
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,330
Yeah.
I have spent some time asking around 

296
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,581
with this Joe,
but a bit like that same reason that we 

297
00:15:05,581 --> 00:15:06,250
spent time asking around with they'll 
pocket square.

298
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,330
It's.
I remember thinking how much I found the

299
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:15,331
suit repugnant and I became angry that 
the suit had been robbed from us and so 

300
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:22,741
I had to create an alibi away in to 
understand why is that?

301
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,410
I'd like a suit.
This was the magic of Ralph and in the 

302
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,261
magic of Ralph Lauren,
Nice Jewish boy from New York called 

303
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:34,231
Lipschitz,
created a waspy empire is a wonderful 

304
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:35,180
expression that,
you know,

305
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:40,260
think Yiddish,
dress British and Ralph Lauren created 

306
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,170
this great empire and resold the waspy 
world back to the waspy world.

307
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Oh,
you actually not to the waspy world 

308
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,320
because in England there was a sort of 
resentment about savile row traditional 

309
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:53,950
tailoring because it'd been robbed from 
them.

310
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,070
The officers that come along,
the number crunchers that come along and

311
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:03,100
there was no creativity in the suit.
A suit needs to be creative.

312
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,560
The person that puts it on can't be 
putting it on,

313
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:08,590
but because he's told to put it on,
he's got a one or put it on.

314
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,100
Uh Huh.

315
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,310
So what Ralph did is he fashioned up 
there sort of cause I new England world 

316
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,260
and salt.
He,

317
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:22,261
he took on a trope,
he took on a cliche and he refashioned 

318
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:23,210
that cliche to give it a new sense of 
life,

319
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,210
a new sense of breath.
He'd put black people in.

320
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:28,970
The suits were traditionally,
it was just a white man's suit.

321
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,440
He made it feel new.
We gave it a take.

322
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:34,010
So what he did is he tipped his hat,
the old world,

323
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,870
but also tipped his hat,
the new world.

324
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,350
And it allowed wasps to find their way 
back into the world with an eloquent 

325
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,460
narrative.
It was clever.

326
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Um,
I'm getting fascinated by the way your 

327
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,411
brain works because for you it's 
important that the person wants to wear 

328
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:51,690
the suit.
And I have a feeling that that's.

329
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,680
So that's symbolic of how you feel about
life itself.

330
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,220
Like the person has to want to be doing 
what they're doing.

331
00:16:59,221 --> 00:17:03,030
They have to want to wear that suit.
It has to be an authentic gesture.

332
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:08,570
Um,
did you ever read a book called extreme 

333
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:08,570
ownership written by a couple of navy 
seals?

334
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,840
That's Jocko Willink,
right?

335
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,830
No,
no.

336
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:11,670
That's.
I think it is.

337
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,150
Is it your job was booked?
Yeah,

338
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,860
yeah,
yeah.

339
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:16,710
But Jack on the show a bunch of times.
Important Book.

340
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,740
Why I've got them on once before.
What am I talking about a bunch of 

341
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:21,740
times.
I've met him once,

342
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,850
but it's an important book.
Yes.

343
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,200
Now there's lots of books that I've 
picked up on this theme,

344
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:28,860
but they were very eloquent about it.
If you don't own something,

345
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,420
you're not the boss.
You have to take full responsibility for

346
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:36,360
everything that you do.
Why be subservient?

347
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,660
You must be the master of your own 
kingdom.

348
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,320
I feel you.
It makes a lot of sense.

349
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,470
You've got to own that.
You can't just walk into things with 

350
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,560
your eyes half open.
You will walk into things with your eyes

351
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:57,561
fully open.
You got to know what you're getting 

352
00:17:57,561 --> 00:17:59,151
into.
You have to take possession of your 

353
00:17:59,151 --> 00:18:01,641
life.
Is this a thought process that you have 

354
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:01,860
to constantly reaffirm or is this is 
exactly that.

355
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,890
It's exactly that.
You drift on this point and it is 

356
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,510
whatever form of meditation or Mantra 
that you decided to espouse the needs to

357
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:17,391
be some period in your day where you 
remember that there's a world out there 

358
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,910
trying to tell you who you are and 
there's a world in here that's trying to

359
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:25,530
tell you who you are.
Now,

360
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:30,531
where do you want to put your x?
Because the world outside is very noisy 

361
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:33,540
and very tempting and as all the 
Razzmatazz as all the tents and,

362
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,290
and all the glitter,

363
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,120
it's called the toys.
But that's because you don't think 

364
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,820
you're enough in the first place.
Uh,

365
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,340
you don't think you're enough in the 
first place.

366
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,550
The whole idea of the world to sell your
staff is first of all,

367
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:49,320
they have to make you feel bad about 
yourself.

368
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,350
Less than in some way.
And I didn't resent this system by the 

369
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:54,350
way.
It is the system,

370
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,560
but most of the expression about don't 
hate,

371
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,350
don't hate the player,
hate the game.

372
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,560
Don't hate the game.
Love the game because you're in it,

373
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,580
mate,
so own the game except the rules and 

374
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,051
move on into the rules so the world will
try and tell you who you are and you 

375
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:19,671
have to tell yourself who you are and 
there's this ongoing battle and somehow 

376
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:21,600
that there needs to be a reconciliation 
between the two,

377
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,360
but in the end you've got to have all 
the eggs in your basket.

378
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,210
There's also an ongoing internal battle 
though,

379
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:27,530
isn't there?

380
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:32,550
There's the you that you want people to 
think you are and there's the you who 

381
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,260
you are and trying to figure out like,
how do I,

382
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,420
how do I figure out who I am?
I am I do I have a correct assumption of

383
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:45,421
how the people are perceiving me and how
I actually am objectively or am I 

384
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:48,310
bullshitting them world with this suit 
and pocket square?

385
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,940
Yeah.
I would say that is exactly the scenario

386
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:56,160
that we're talking about.
The essentially one to two worlds is the

387
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,660
inner world of energy in this email to 
weld of energy.

388
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:00,130
This,
those two identities,

389
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:01,330
ones,
real ones falls.

390
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,280
The external world is.
I'm asking you to tell me who I am.

391
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:12,060
That's what we're all playing at,
and as soon as you start playing that 

392
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,060
game,
we run into all sorts of trouble,

393
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,160
call it ego,
call it whatever you want to call it,

394
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,330
but that's the dynamic that we're in and
somehow we have to

395
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,340
give ourselves enough confidence to 
reassure ourselves that we are enough.

396
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,490
However,
I enter the game because I've got to 

397
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,951
move on in the world.
It got crack on in the world and I know 

398
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:31,951
there's loads temptations that come 
along the way,

399
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,860
so I will own the suit.
I'm going to wear the suit.

400
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:38,910
I'm going to Wyoming.
The soup now don't mean by paying for 

401
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,430
it.
I mean by owning it,

402
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,300
it's now mine suit.
It's my idea to put on this suit.

403
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:48,450
I have to personalize it in some way.
I have to understand a narrative that 

404
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,201
allows me to own that suit and thereby I
put on my suit of armor and I come out 

405
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:56,701
into the world and guess what?
I'm in a good time because I'm owning 

406
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:56,701
the suit.
Now.

407
00:20:56,701 --> 00:21:01,621
This is a very rock solid philosophy.
Is this something you've ever written 

408
00:21:01,621 --> 00:21:04,940
down?
It's what the essence of narrative.

409
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,980
I'm storyteller.
The essence of narrative is only about 

410
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,711
this dynamic.
There is nothing else in a story other 

411
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:17,621
than this dynamic,
so the struggle between other people's 

412
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:23,060
perceptions and your own wants and 
desires and who you truly are,

413
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:27,620
your your significant real self.
That's it.

414
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,620
That's all there is.
You tell me a story that didn't,

415
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,920
that we engaged in that famous.
That's not about this journey.

416
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,560
I'll give you an example.
The political son

417
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,940
parable,
Christian seems to religious doesn't 

418
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:43,940
really make much sense.
You know this story?

419
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,840
Sure,
but why don't you lay it out?

420
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,680
So there's a father,
he has two sons and all of a sudden the 

421
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,501
youngest son,
and he says to them who wants to spend 

422
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:54,501
their inheritance?
The youngest has,

423
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:59,231
has made that dog and spend it,
and the younger son takes all the dough 

424
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:03,800
and he runs off and sniff coke off 
stripper's tits for a number of years 

425
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,300
until he realizes this is getting pretty
boring and I'm in a lot of trouble.

426
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,270
He ends up feeding,
throwing food pics.

427
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:17,300
That's his job and he couldn't even eat 
the food that he gives to the pics.

428
00:22:17,341 --> 00:22:18,570
At which point he says,
Dad,

429
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:19,530
will you take me back?

430
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,430
That then goes to,
they don't meet.

431
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,940
This somehow happens.
Not through telephones.

432
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,440
It just happens at which point that goes
to the fatty carbs has killed the fatted

433
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:33,790
calf.
Older sons,

434
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,140
his own dad.
What's going on?

435
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,960
I've stayed with you since the 
beginning.

436
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,990
I've been loyal to you and I hear the 
stories of my younger brother coming 

437
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,941
back who's been sniffing coke off 
stripper's tits for the last God knows 

438
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:49,030
how many years and you're prepared.
Kill the fatted calf.

439
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,520
What's the spa that I want another 
story.

440
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,460
This is your son.
Don't worry about that.

441
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,950
You take a little side step,
little step to the side.

442
00:22:56,951 --> 00:22:58,300
You'll always be with me.
You're a good boy.

443
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,140
At which point he goes out to meet the 
product,

444
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,730
the wasteful son,
the waste some returns,

445
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,850
and he says,
you will also know you're found.

446
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,580
That's the end of the story is quite 
hard to make sense of that.

447
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:13,710
In a literal sense.
You Go,

448
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:15,210
Oh,
dad was a bit unfair.

449
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,240
You should have been unkind to the 
oldest son because he never ran off and 

450
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,551
did anything,
but the essence of the story is that you

451
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:28,580
are the father.
You are enough.

452
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,590
Your oldest son is your intellect.
He says,

453
00:23:33,591 --> 00:23:34,070
oh,
danger.

454
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,290
There's danger that is trying to 
reconcile,

455
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,900
makes sense of a present and material 
world.

456
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:44,650
The younger son being the wild feral 
entity that is wants to go out and find 

457
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:47,360
out what it's all about,

458
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,280
so when his recklessness and sense of 
adventure,

459
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,220
he finds that he can't escape himself,

460
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:03,120
so we have to return to himself and at 
which point he has to accept who he is,

461
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,510
which button the intellect is left out.
The equation pretty much is the older 

462
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,141
brother because he can't understand the 
significance of the journey of the 

463
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,330
wasteful brother.
Any end,

464
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:20,870
you have to leave yourself to understand
the value of yourself.

465
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:26,300
You have to lose stuff before you 
realize that all the stuff that you're 

466
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,960
losing is a femoral and transitory.
It's not yours.

467
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,420
You are enough.
You are always enough,

468
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,260
but you've got to somehow prostitute 
yourself before you realized you were in

469
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:36,960
value.
That is the essence of all stories.

470
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,880
That's deep guy.
Richie,

471
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,280
is that something you think about all 
the time or is this.

472
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,200
I mean this is like a segmented 
philosophy lip,

473
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:49,350
so king off stock you just made a man is
a king.

474
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,090
As a son,
the son,

475
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,530
the father is runs into a bit of aggro.

476
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:00,570
The son jumps into a little boat,
a little skillet,

477
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,910
and he's not scale it.
That's what you got your chops on,

478
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:04,470
isn't it?
A skiff.

479
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,230
Little skiff.
The skiff takes off down the river.

480
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:10,290
He gets found by prostitutes.
He's bought up in a brothel.

481
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,030
He understands the ways that the street,
he becomes a king on the street.

482
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,480
He works his way out that different 
ladders and then he pulls a soul from a 

483
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,280
stone at a certain point in his life,
certain point of evolution,

484
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,280
and then from there he goes on to be the
king as a bit of a tussle over along the

485
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:31,281
way,
lots of wrestling matches in the 

486
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:31,281
endophyte,
his demons,

487
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,951
and he becomes the king.
So what's the significance of this 

488
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:36,681
narrative?
That every man and himself is irs 

489
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:37,230
socratic,
that he is his own king.

490
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,230
He takes the sojourn into the material 
world,

491
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:45,231
has climb up all the different runs on 
the ladder and ultimately has to return 

492
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:45,231
to himself.

493
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:47,190
The significance of the extraction from 
the sword,

494
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:50,820
from the stone is the stone is the 
material world,

495
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,450
the material world,
which seems all solid because it 

496
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,120
controls you whilst you're projecting 
your sense of identity upon it.

497
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,990
The extraction of the stone is taking 
back your own authority.

498
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,490
You're Rhone divinity around authority,
around identity,

499
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:07,590
whatever it is that you've got to call 
it your own power.

500
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,040
You will no longer looking for a sense 
of self outside of yourself and then you

501
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:16,041
have to face the demons that you've 
created and your history by facing them 

502
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:21,081
and fighting them and owning them.
You put them in the face of who you are 

503
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:25,520
and that's a wrestling match.
You'd have to take away all these 

504
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,090
crutches and that's all that we 
struggled from in life is taken away,

505
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:29,100
are crutches.
Oh,

506
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:30,660
please tell me who I am.
Oh,

507
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:35,670
please give me a bit more money so the 
people think I'm clever or when they're 

508
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:35,670
not.

509
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:35,720
Have a nice cut horn.
People think I'm clever.

510
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You got to take away all these crutches 
and stand as the man that you are and 

511
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,110
you're liberated from your whole thing.
That is the story of King Arthur,

512
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,780
but it's not just the story of King 
Arthur.

513
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:49,790
It's the story of all narrative.
Do you think that most people that are 

514
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:49,790
watching the film,
we're going to get that though.

515
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,300
They're just going to get an 
entertaining story.

516
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,920
They're just going to see a bunch of 
cool stuff,

517
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:57,921
some drama play out,
but this is fascinating that you're 

518
00:26:57,921 --> 00:26:59,340
operating so many levels underneath it.
He bought him a storyteller on business,

519
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:04,341
so if I'm in the business of store,
I might as well understand story and do 

520
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:05,940
you need to understand a lot?
I'm not sure if you do.

521
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,000
Depends where you on the ladder so you 
can just go along.

522
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,380
I have a nice bit of entertainment,
good guy,

523
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:11,940
bad guy.
Everything is literal.

524
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,360
There's nothing wrong with literalism.
It is what it is.

525
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:20,420
It's the game you can glean what you can
glean when you're ready to glean what 

526
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,870
you're ready to glean or you Joseph 
Campbell Fan.

527
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,320
I am a Joseph Campbell Fan.
Yeah,

528
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,320
yeah.
That,

529
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,080
I mean,
that's a reoccurring theme in his work,

530
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:29,910
the hero's journey,
the hero's journey,

531
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:34,930
these underlying sort of narrative that 
just really guides all,

532
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:40,161
all stories and all ancient tales and 
that there's something inherently human 

533
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:43,461
about them important about these stories
and they resonate with our wants and 

534
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:48,531
needs and goals and even also maybe the 
structure that we really truly need in 

535
00:27:48,531 --> 00:27:50,400
our own life.
Yeah.

536
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,340
I mean all the stories from whatever 
period.

537
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,490
I'm sympathetic to this particular,
um,

538
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,520
to Joseph Campbell's philosophy on this,
but he's not the only one.

539
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,580
Right.
The weird thing about religion is 

540
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,011
religion has done to this spiritual 
significance of narrative.

541
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,450
Well,
the businessman did to the suit.

542
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:15,870
He's literalized it.
He didn't realize that putting on a suit

543
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,240
is putting on a suit.
Obama,

544
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,150
he's putting on something that's rather 
spectacular.

545
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,030
It's just doing it for convention you're
doing for others.

546
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:27,510
You're not doing it for you.
And in all literal mind,

547
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,690
we look at a narrative and we see the 
narrative for what we believe it to be,

548
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,010
the exterior aspect of the narrative.
So we completely,

549
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,800
we see the world upside down.
We don't.

550
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,040
We're not actually interested in the 
essence of the narrative because we're 

551
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,490
so busy pandering after the approval of 
others.

552
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,230
So everything that we see,
every narrative that we listened to,

553
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:57,390
every film that you say,
you're not really interested in its 

554
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,190
soul,
you're interested in it's body because 

555
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:05,091
that's what we correspond to.
It's fascinating that you're comparing 

556
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:07,941
it to suits because it resonates.
Like when you think of a guy showing up 

557
00:29:07,941 --> 00:29:12,861
for work or getting ready for work and 
he doesn't want to go and he's putting 

558
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:16,041
on the suit and it's just dredging 
through it and putting it on and or you 

559
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:20,301
think about a guy who was crisply 
tucking in his collars and putting on 

560
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:24,741
his cuff links and tightening up his tie
and he feels empowered by the whole 

561
00:29:24,741 --> 00:29:25,320
process of it.

562
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,360
It's very.
It's very appealing.

563
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,340
They're like,
have you seen in a film too?

564
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,140
It's very exciting.
This is a man of purpose.

565
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,770
They didn't mean streets,
I don't know.

566
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,020
You remember harvey cartel and getting 
dressed to go up on a Friday,

567
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,120
getting dressed to go out Friday night 
and it affected a whole generation of 

568
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,120
people about the way they dress because 
he,

569
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,600
it.
Yeah.

570
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,010
I never really thought about that until 
this conversation because I just,

571
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,740
I don't really wear suits occasionally.
Very,

572
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:52,360
very occasionally.
But you'd been robbed.

573
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,850
I've been robbed.
You've been world.

574
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,920
There are so many aspects of life.
Food for a long time got robbed from us 

575
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,930
and we've slowly managed to claw that 
back.

576
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:02,360
It's true.
Um,

577
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:07,530
but clothes really.
You're a 45 year old geezer and you 

578
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,870
still dressing like an 18 year old cast 
is all about.

579
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:16,170
Well,
some people like to be comfortable 

580
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:16,170
though.

581
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:16,170
I get that by the way.
And they liked that look.

582
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,810
Comfortable.
Your students comfortable.

583
00:30:17,811 --> 00:30:22,811
It's comfortable.
You can get pulled into this completely 

584
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:23,740
deconstructed on the inside maybe by a 
chap called Brunello,

585
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,290
knows what he's doing.
So these are all handmade.

586
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,510
Um,
so it won't be handmade,

587
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,250
tailored a.
no,

588
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,220
I bought this off the shelf and I had a 
couple of things tweet,

589
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,210
but it's as comfortable as a pair of 
pajamas.

590
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,230
Really?
Yeah.

591
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,850
See again,
you have to broker a deal.

592
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:42,760
You can't put on things that are 
uncomfortable because guess what happens

593
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:43,950
in the morning?
You're looking through your suit.

594
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,440
You'd go,
oh,

595
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:46,420
I like that one.
One with a comfortable one,

596
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,800
so they all have to be comfortable while
otherwise you don't get to play the 

597
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:52,800
game.
Here.

598
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,980
I have a thing about ties though.
Go on,

599
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,100
I'd kill someone with a tie on for sure.
You can kill some 100 percent if I get 

600
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,571
ahold of that.
Tie Your Dead Joe is conversation needs 

601
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:04,210
to go on for longer.

602
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,490
Zip ties.
You're wearing a rope around your neck.

603
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,370
If someone just gets a deep grab.
Joe,

604
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,960
what are you thinking about?
Twist.

605
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,940
I'm not going to have a fight with 
anyone,

606
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,560
but it's.
I mean you would have to in a deep 

607
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,421
disagreement.
You'd have to wrestle that sucker loose 

608
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:27,070
and take it off to be safe.
I'm not going to indulge this,

609
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,850
shouldn't you?
Should.

610
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,740
That's my own personal problem.
I just feel like someone with a tie on,

611
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:35,440
all you have to do is grab that thing 
and that's a wrap.

612
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,500
Like if you went into a Jujitsu match 
and you had a rope around your neck,

613
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,030
your Jujitsu practitioner,
right?

614
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:40,810
I am,
yeah.

615
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,540
So don't you've.
I'm sure you've been colored choke then.

616
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,660
Yeah.
Yup.

617
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,150
In Fun for 20 years.
Twenty years thing around your neck.

618
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Like really by the way money game is.
I'm all about the gay.

619
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,230
I mean,
yeah,

620
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,320
I played a lot known gay,
but I've come back to the gay and the 

621
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,310
reason I've come back to the gate is I 
can quite tasty with the gay.

622
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,680
So tasty contests with a gay icon as a 
couple moves.

623
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,410
I like to show it's a bit tricky on the,
on your with your t shirt,

624
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,580
but I'm all about strategy man with his 
gay.

625
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Um,
which somehow elegantly segues from the 

626
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,681
tie.
I mean I'm all about creating what I 

627
00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:26,200
call the hangman's rope out of the 
bottom of your gay.

628
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,620
Turning that into a thing.
So you're one of those guys that pull 

629
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:31,620
the bottom of that canyon,
wraps up.

630
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,680
I'm that guy out there and I played this
game for a long time,

631
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,710
which is the wrapping around the wrist 
or you know,

632
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,710
the,
at the eeg.

633
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,040
So you

634
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,150
get that little dinosaur flippy there,
so your arms out of action.

635
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,830
But then I discovered something,
Joe,

636
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:51,100
if you slipped back in through there.
So what he's doing for people just 

637
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,821
listening,
he's talking like towards is on the 

638
00:32:54,821 --> 00:32:57,551
inside,
inside crack of his elbow and once it 

639
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:57,551
comes in the inside

640
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:59,630
you can't get that hand out again.
That's it.

641
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,160
Basically the font server from the,

642
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,550
the fights over from there because from 
then on you Umm,

643
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,840
the um.
Hm.

644
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,060
That's interesting.
We should have a little roller on it.

645
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,780
Yeah.
This job.

646
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,710
How long have you been trained?
In?

647
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,680
Twenty years.
What about 20 years from Enza.

648
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,470
Oh,
that's legit man.

649
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:21,850
That's seriously legit.
Do you think most people know that 

650
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:21,850
you've managed to keep that on the dl?
A little bit?

651
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,360
Not so much.
Not so much,

652
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,760
no.
Well,

653
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,540
I think if you asked the average person 
the street,

654
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,430
this Guy Ritchie a black belt in 
Jujitsu,

655
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,600
they go,
no,

656
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,140
but just the average man in the street,
no black belt in Jujitsu is anyway.

657
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,100
I think they do now more than ever.
Yeah,

658
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,040
probably more now.
Well,

659
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:40,830
that's why when I see a guy that's 
experienced as you were in a tie,

660
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,100
I go,
hmm.

661
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,470
Maybe just super confident about no one 
being able to get to that time.

662
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,850
Joe was scaring off.
Well,

663
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:49,680
I'm a ridiculous person.
That's what's going on.

664
00:33:49,681 --> 00:33:51,930
I mean,
you have your own ridiculous ideas about

665
00:33:51,931 --> 00:33:53,580
owning suits.
I have my ideas.

666
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,980
Ideas about getting choked to death,
wearing a tie.

667
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,770
Like I said,
I'm not going to indulge your fishing.

668
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,760
I love fishing.
I'm honestly,

669
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:05,220
I do.
I really do have an issue with ties.

670
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,290
Okay.
But it looks wonderful on you.

671
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,520
Thank you very much.
I mean,

672
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,470
for real,
it's very elegant appearance,

673
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,030
the whole thing from the top to the 
bottom.

674
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,820
When did you start training a under who 
were like,

675
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,390
where were you?

676
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,290
Um,
first of all,

677
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:20,360
I did karate for 15 years.
I did shut a it,

678
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,510
which I was obsessed with.
Go second down in that.

679
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,610
And then acl went twice on the right leg
and I watched choke.

680
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,080
Can you remember chuck?
Sure.

681
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,520
And I want to choke.
And that was a,

682
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,800
it was a revelation because old man,
what was his mother?

683
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,120
Julio,
Elio,

684
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,850
Elio,
Elio Element.

685
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,330
India was on the map it for in that 
video I thought,

686
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:47,490
well,
I'm not getting any younger and if I'm 

687
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,310
going to take up a martial art,
I love fighting.

688
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:49,870
So I'm very happy to talk about funding 
for a long time.

689
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,710
I'm a fancy the idea that because if I 
stayed with karate I realized I would 

690
00:34:56,081 --> 00:34:58,990
not be on the mat at 84.
So,

691
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,110
and back then there was no Jujitsu in 
London.

692
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,260
That was judo and they had what was 
called the Waza,

693
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,080
which is the ground game and they're 
pretty tasty.

694
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,760
We got some good judo players.
Um,

695
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,840
so I went from crotty to judo,
but I was only interested in the ground 

696
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,991
game.
And then Roger Gracie came to live in 

697
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,811
the UK about 20 years ago.
And Roger Gracie went onto become the 

698
00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:26,551
world champion eight times and I started
taking lessons with him and his Dad 

699
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,150
Maricio.
Then I ended up in New York for,

700
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,190
I think we lived.
I lived in New York for awhile.

701
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:39,350
My ex wife and I went to the Zos gym 
when it was above the Methadone clinic 

702
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:45,890
and I fell in love with pencil and I 
fell in love with Jujitsu in a sort of 

703
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:50,630
serious way.
And I became obsessed with it for a 

704
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,120
number of years.
Hence I get me a lot belts.

705
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:52,690
Um,

706
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,970
I mean I should've got black belt 10.
Well,

707
00:35:54,971 --> 00:35:57,280
I say I should've got a black belt.
I was,

708
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,260
I was,
I became lazy to a degree.

709
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,480
So I've got a black belt when I 
should've got a black belt.

710
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,090
And as you and I know there's some tasty
blue belts out there,

711
00:36:04,091 --> 00:36:06,940
can I have a lot of fun with me?
Um,

712
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,340
but I sort of drifted a bit.
I came in and out,

713
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,810
sustained a few injuries,
but if I was training hard,

714
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,570
you train hard,
you get black pound five years on you,

715
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,140
you got to be obsessed with kids.
Oh,

716
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,660
the kids are.
You can.

717
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,970
I mean,
I was a brown belt for eight years,

718
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,220
so he talked to them and I know that I'm
the same as you.

719
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,950
I was praying about for eight years.
I think it's a.

720
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,400
If you're a real fanatic,
you could get it in five years,

721
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:35,100
but it's super rare.
Like Bj Penn got it in three.

722
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,480
That's almost unheard of.
There's a few people that

723
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,420
done that.
Yeah.

724
00:36:38,421 --> 00:36:43,010
There's some guys in our gym in London 
in Roger's place that they're there five

725
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:44,390
days a week,
three hours a day.

726
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:49,130
They mean it and within six months 
they're at proper pain in the ass.

727
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

728
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:55,311
Well,
once you become obsessed with the 

729
00:36:55,311 --> 00:36:55,311
movements and you start studying the 
various positions and the possibilities,

730
00:36:55,311 --> 00:36:57,930
it becomes a part of your life,
becomes a part of your.

731
00:36:57,931 --> 00:37:02,400
Almost like your your operating system 
and as you see these guys reinforce that

732
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:03,790
operating system,
you see their,

733
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:06,390
their game becoming more and more 
complex and the beetle,

734
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:10,890
that chain attack after attack and being
able to anticipate the defenses of those

735
00:37:10,891 --> 00:37:14,160
attacks and plan two and three steps 
ahead and you see all this play out.

736
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,210
It's an uh,
may I,

737
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:20,211
I really,
really enjoy watching someone go from 

738
00:37:20,211 --> 00:37:20,340
being a beginning student to being a 
killer.

739
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:25,580
It's a fascinating process because you 
are literally watching someone develop 

740
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:30,140
their comprehension of a language of 
fighting and that language of fighting 

741
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,431
is analogous to life.
It helps them in every single aspect of 

742
00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:38,181
their life because it's one of the most 
difficult things that a person will do 

743
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:38,181
in their day.

744
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:38,950
When you walk into a Jujitsu school,
you're,

745
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:44,010
you park your car,
you live in this normal realm of normal 

746
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,900
people with normal problems and bills 
and stresses and issues.

747
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:51,110
But once you go into that thing,
he put on that Gi or no gi or whatever 

748
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,270
you're doing and you'd go into that 
class.

749
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,450
Once you engage in these sparring 
sessions,

750
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:58,140
he's sparring sessions with skilled 
practitioners.

751
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,150
You're doing one of the most difficult 
things.

752
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:05,151
Any person within a hundred mile radius 
of you that's not fighting for their 

753
00:38:05,151 --> 00:38:07,230
life is doing,
and by doing that on a regular basis and

754
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,530
constantly reinforcing this language,
it enhances the all your possibilities 

755
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:15,360
and your potential possibilities as a 
person.

756
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,060
Very eloquent comment.
Couldn't,

757
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:24,180
couldn't agree with you more.
One of the great things I found about 

758
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,641
Jujitsu is whenever I came to a city,
we just tap into a computer where the 

759
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,220
next Jim was and we wrote down there.
I usually,

760
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:32,050
I'm usually with two or three people and
I've been out there.

761
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:34,170
He's also a black belt.
Um,

762
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,470
uh,
got a chaplet.

763
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,420
Uh,
I was with called bobby the tits,

764
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,480
who was an Olympic judo player.
I can usually say the chest on this 

765
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,601
gaze.
At least that's why I'm so across 

766
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:48,730
through and Ivan the terrible and bobby 
the tits.

767
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:53,230
We used to hit these gyms and uh,
everyone,

768
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,460
there's a guest complete substructure 
thereof.

769
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,570
If you want to be looked after,
they'll give you a gap fellow mate as it

770
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:03,571
going into the Brotherhood.
I suppose it's probably the same for 

771
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:03,571
people.
Go to church,

772
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:07,051
I don't know,
but there is a brotherhood that I found 

773
00:39:07,051 --> 00:39:09,721
amongst fighters where everyone's like 
game and friendly come around at the 

774
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:12,380
barbecue and everyone's as whole sub 
structure there that everyone will look 

775
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,381
after everyone else and I've never in 
the 20 years of fighting in different 

776
00:39:16,381 --> 00:39:19,960
gyms have I lost my temper or I had a 
reason to lose my temper.

777
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Is anyone ever been a bully?
If people a bit clumsy got bit carried 

778
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,400
away,
but there's such a system of accountancy

779
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:33,210
that you can't get away with being a 
bully because there's always a bigger 

780
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,270
bullying and you know you're going to 
get found out and I liked that aspect of

781
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,830
it.
Everyone gets found out.

782
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,800
Yeah.
Especially over time.

783
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,860
Right?
I mean if you're training consistently 

784
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,760
with really difficult trading partners,
your characters going to be tested.

785
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:46,690
There's just nowhere.
There's nothing.

786
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,720
There's no way around it.
And sometimes I ended up training quite 

787
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:51,720
a lot in at home.
Right?

788
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,570
I got five,
six mates to come around there.

789
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:56,050
It's not the same as going to a new gym 
with new players.

790
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,390
Um,
and you've got to get out there.

791
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:02,590
I know a few rich guys that have got 
trainers and they not bad players,

792
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:05,830
you know,
the train is good and the is a good,

793
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,400
but because they don't get outside of 
their comfort zone and go to a federal 

794
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,841
jim,
Jim on the street there that it's very 

795
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:17,050
hard for them to really evolve.

796
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:22,070
Right?
You got to keep putting yourself in an 

797
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:22,480
uncomfortable spot in uncomfortable gyms
and like,

798
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:24,280
as you said,
when you do that though,

799
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:27,460
you do see the kind of the same thing 
over and over again.

800
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,620
The same type of human,
you know,

801
00:40:29,621 --> 00:40:33,130
you just see them in London or you see 
them in New York or Los Angeles.

802
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:38,131
You see that same type of human.
It's the great thing about a sport in 

803
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:42,331
general,
but let's be specific because it's 

804
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:43,810
something that you and I can relate to 
is there are no barriers in Jujitsu.

805
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,760
No one's looking at you.
If you're poor,

806
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,480
you're black,
you're white.

807
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:51,481
It's completely irrelevant.
You come to the mat and if you get on 

808
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:51,481
with the gays,
you fight,

809
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:52,210
you get on with the gaze that you 
fighting.

810
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:55,810
Yeah,
and there's a complete clarity of vision

811
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,270
when you fighting so much,
just finding them and then you rate them

812
00:40:58,271 --> 00:40:59,590
on their ability of how they fight.

813
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,290
Yeah,
and you carry that social hierarchy,

814
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:07,291
like what the wood.
What's important in that school is that 

815
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:11,970
it is like who is proficient?
Who is very good that that's the best 

816
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,140
currency.
The ultimate currency.

817
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:13,680
Yeah.
Right.

818
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

819
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:19,590
I had a name when I used to train out 
here or in New York that they used to 

820
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,940
call me Hollywood because I was young.
You said Liberty it person that you come

821
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:22,500
in and say,
oh,

822
00:41:22,501 --> 00:41:24,070
well I only.
What'd you find that it roll around?

823
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,410
But that,
you know,

824
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:28,210
in a couple of people initially went,
oh yeah,

825
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:33,220
that gazer and that lasted all of 30 
seconds and then everything gets washed.

826
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,000
Can you have no currency on the map 
other than your currency on the mat?

827
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,070
And there's a wonderful clarity in that.

828
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:45,390
Yeah.
For a guy like you or any any big time 

829
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,941
celebrity,
that's probably one of the only few 

830
00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:47,941
places where you really truly 
experienced that,

831
00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:52,090
like there's no bullshit in that role,
like in someone's going after you and 

832
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,800
you're going after them.
It's 100 percent.

833
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,810
It is what it is.
There's,

834
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,330
there's all the.
The,

835
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,590
the bullshit veil of society has been 
removed.

836
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:04,100
Yeah,
I mean on Monday the water a bit now.

837
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,150
So harking back to what we were talking 
about previously,

838
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:13,630
I'm aware that you become less 
adventurous as your ego grows in 

839
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,060
Jujitsu.
Right?

840
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,370
Particularly with the guy that doesn't 
tap tap.

841
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:24,610
You don't ever want to be the guy that 
doesn't tap and you hung up when you 

842
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,970
become a boring fighter and it's an 
issue.

843
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,300
You know those guys.
There's a couple of guys that I can 

844
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,631
think of.
One in particular that if you get the 

845
00:42:34,631 --> 00:42:34,631
better of him and by and large is better
than me,

846
00:42:34,631 --> 00:42:37,950
but all of a sudden you realize is in 
trouble just before I'm about to tap.

847
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,620
And he goes,
oh,

848
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,830
stop that.
Once I go.

849
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,450
If you just moved a little bit to the 
instruction,

850
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:48,470
those guys,
that's their alibi to get out them 

851
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:51,610
losing face,
so what phase is it they're losing is 

852
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,760
the crutch that they actually think that
being a Jujitsu player has an identity 

853
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:57,140
in itself and it doesn't.

854
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,860
You cannot use it as a crutch and that's
the essence of all martial arts.

855
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,890
Martial arts was about find yourself 
within that framework and be honest 

856
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:12,101
about it and you meet the opponent and 
his condo will tell you you're finding 

857
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:18,250
it's about you fighting you in the ring.
What your other part of the mind to the 

858
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:23,711
other bottom on that we were talking 
about once I say it's about your 

859
00:43:23,711 --> 00:43:24,910
reputation in the gym and what people 
think of it.

860
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,040
Again,
you're trying to find an identity from 

861
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,441
outside of yourself by not tapping and 
you know that feeling and by the way I 

862
00:43:32,441 --> 00:43:33,320
suffered myself because I didn't like to
tap either,

863
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,300
but it.
It makes my game.

864
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,210
It inhibits my game and it stops me.
Being creative.

865
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:41,240
Marcella Garcia has always been very 
adamant about that,

866
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:46,270
that you have to open up your game in 
the gym and it's the only way to really 

867
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,600
truly progress and don't worry about 
being tapped and don't have that ego and

868
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:52,070
there's a great video of him and Damien 
Maia Rolling and they're rolling.

869
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,910
They have like they're putting almost no
like kinetic strength,

870
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:57,890
no explosive energy,
nothing,

871
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,270
no,
nothing athletic.

872
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:04,450
They're just going through the movements
and exchanging positions and they're 

873
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,320
tapping each other left and right and 
left and right with no ego.

874
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:11,380
It's really interesting to watch because
you see like Marcello Catch Damien and 

875
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,911
they brought to a position and Damien 
taps and then they go through another 

876
00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:15,911
position and Marcello does it and it's 
just.

877
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:19,280
It's really fascinating because when 
they're doing they're truly flowing.

878
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,320
There's no like real,
oh here we go right there.

879
00:44:21,321 --> 00:44:24,500
You can see them do it,
but like when these guys would do it,

880
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:29,501
like as they're doing it,
they're obviously using strength and 

881
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:32,501
they're countering with skill,
but everything is very smooth

882
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,580
and controlled and you're looking at two
of the very best black belts to ever do 

883
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,820
it.
You're looking at Damien Maia,

884
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:43,821
who right now is arguably the top 
contender in the UFC welterweight 

885
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:47,841
division.
He's going to be fighting Jorge Mas 

886
00:44:47,841 --> 00:44:50,210
Vidar next weekend actually,
which is a really intense fight because 

887
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:53,980
monster killer and then Marcello Garcia,
who's probably one of the all time great

888
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:56,880
strangulation experts has ever walked 
the face of the planet.

889
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:02,140
I mean,
he's really revolutionized a lot of 

890
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,161
aspects of the good team,
the rear naked choke and I was in 

891
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:07,851
Brazil,
in Sao Paulo in 2003 when he burst onto 

892
00:45:07,851 --> 00:45:09,340
the scene when he choked out.
Chao Lin.

893
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:15,230
And uh,
to see these two guys rolling together 

894
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:18,201
is really,
really interesting because this is 

895
00:45:18,201 --> 00:45:18,201
really kind of how you have to do it.
You just do it.

896
00:45:18,201 --> 00:45:18,201
You know,
there's,

897
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,420
there's no one is saying,
I can't tap,

898
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:22,020
I can't.

899
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:27,220
No,
I can't put myself in a bad position 

900
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,271
there.
They're exchanging positions to like 

901
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:31,311
right there.
When Damian gets under hooks and these 

902
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:31,311
goes for the deep half,
Marcel was just rolling with it.

903
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,470
They're just flowing.
Yeah,

904
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:36,650
but you need two to tango.
You can't have one with an ego and who's

905
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,390
not going to play the game and bunkers 
down and screws himself down.

906
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,280
It makes the whole thing very hard to 
do.

907
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,020
It's got to be.
You both got to be complicit.

908
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,040
Yup.
Yeah,

909
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,540
absolutely.
Yeah,

910
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:50,541
it's very,
it's very interesting watching like to 

911
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:51,390
really,
really high level guys like this role or

912
00:45:51,391 --> 00:45:56,391
like you know,
hydro Gracie and Braulio a steamer or 

913
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:59,721
something like that.
England's got a great scene and there's 

914
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:01,110
so much top level Jujitsu over in 
England right now.

915
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,430
It's go some good players.
Yeah.

916
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:07,610
He used to be a time just a couple of 
decades ago where if you wanted to 

917
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:11,411
train,
it was very difficult to find really 

918
00:46:11,411 --> 00:46:12,370
proficient instruction and groups 
training part 20 years ago.

919
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:17,370
It wasn't possible.
I remember because I was first into it 

920
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,300
when we made snatch,
which is 18 years ago,

921
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,160
and that's when,
how'd you first came to town?

922
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:23,130
And before then it was just you to just 
in the Waza yeah.

923
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,280
Well,
I mean you can certainly get something 

924
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:28,280
out of that,
but um,

925
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,120
it seems like the level of A.
I mean there's some people that have 

926
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:37,041
just one rock solid attack,
like Rhonda Rousey at that rock solid 

927
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:38,310
attack with the arm bar and she comes 
from that judo background.

928
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,260
That's a Jambo.
Oh,

929
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:42,840
it's nasty.
Her arm bar to this day I believe is one

930
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,660
of the best arm bars I've ever seen in 
mma.

931
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,280
Not just because,
uh,

932
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:50,250
she's successful with it.
But when you watch her transitions,

933
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,420
you watch how she's able to adjust and 
change.

934
00:46:52,421 --> 00:46:55,230
And like the cat Zingano fight is a 
perfect example of that.

935
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,530
Cat Zingano just charges out or like a 
fucking bat out of hell.

936
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,450
And they have this mad scramble and 
Rhonda realizes a position that she's,

937
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,460
she doesn't even utilize,
but she's,

938
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,330
she understands armbar so well.
She knows what.

939
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:12,340
I could just throw my hip over this way 
and kick back here and I'll catch that 

940
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,921
arm bar.
This is just overall understanding of 

941
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:16,770
the position is so high level.
Yeah.

942
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:22,730
When someone has a movement,
but I used to find a bit with a Hickson 

943
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:28,260
and Hixon use that thing where he ties 
his hands behind his back and you try 

944
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,970
and do something to it and you can't do 
anything to

945
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:35,260
the level of sophistication when it's 
like that.

946
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:35,940
He's so.
He,

947
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:40,430
so technical hixon that it was.
Well,

948
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,960
what I understand about Jujitsu is 
really rather primitive.

949
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:50,070
Um,
but I'm aware I'm primitive and I'm 

950
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,200
aware that my understanding of Jujitsu 
is really quite primitive.

951
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,500
And then when you see something like 
that arm bar come sneaking out of 

952
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,330
nowhere always said that.
It's a magnificent thing to behold,

953
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:02,310
isn't it?
Yeah.

954
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,920
Yeah.
The when and what you're saying is kind 

955
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:07,920
of interesting because that was 
listening to this and go,

956
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,520
how has a black belt primitive?
What do you not primitive?

957
00:48:09,521 --> 00:48:14,521
You're an expert,
but I understand totally because I'm 

958
00:48:14,521 --> 00:48:14,650
also primitive.
I know,

959
00:48:14,651 --> 00:48:17,970
I know what I know.
Like I understand like there's what,

960
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:23,020
what Hickson's languages is a series of 
words that you've never heard before,

961
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:28,141
spoken perfectly in the right order with
no pauses or ums or no filler and the 

962
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:31,480
way he flows with it,
it's just,

963
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:36,510
he's got a level of proficiency that 
very few other than Marcello and Damien 

964
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:41,550
Maia can really appreciate the,
the true beauty of it all because they 

965
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:42,160
just don't like,
I won't,

966
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,280
I won't see things coming.
It will be there.

967
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,570
They're too complex as it's completely 
different language.

968
00:48:46,571 --> 00:48:47,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

969
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,420
But you know enough.
I'm already good lines on my,

970
00:48:50,421 --> 00:48:53,350
the other day that someone had enough 
brains to know that they didn't have any

971
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:55,960
brains.
Um,

972
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:01,540
so you know enough to know that you're 
in treacherous in deep waters here.

973
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,130
Yeah.
Otherwise,

974
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:08,160
your average gazes styles,
styles running around with one of these 

975
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,150
good guys.
Bad guys,

976
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,140
jovial guy.
There'll be the same.

977
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:13,180
They got the same color belt on it.
Let's have a go with that.

978
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:13,890
Yeah.

979
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,250
Yeah.
You just get manhandled now.

980
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:20,230
Um,
you said you had your knee fixed,

981
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,870
you a blue.
Would you blow out an acl acl?

982
00:49:22,871 --> 00:49:23,710
Done it twice.
Yeah.

983
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,060
Did you get um,
cadaver replacement or no?

984
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,650
Hamstring.
And then Patella hamstrings,

985
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,010
patella second to task stream blew out,
right?

986
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,720
Yeah.
Those things blow out a lot.

987
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:34,380
Uh,
yeah.

988
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,970
Eventually gave in.
I had the first one that was about 21.

989
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:42,210
Okay.
And then the second one down was about 

990
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:42,210
31 and it was held together,
but they own needs a bit knackered.

991
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:42,520
Do you know about stem?
So yeah.

992
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,960
How are you feeling about the great.
I was that close to shoulder surgery and

993
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:50,650
I had some placental stem cells shot 
into my shoulder and it's amazing.

994
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,660
And where did you have that done?
Vegas.

995
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:53,740
Really?
Yeah.

996
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:57,400
There's a guy named Dr Rodney Mcgee was 
at the tip of the spear when it comes to

997
00:49:57,401 --> 00:49:59,690
the technology that's involved today,
what was the issue?

998
00:49:59,691 --> 00:50:02,650
And to show the punch of tears,
just stuff,

999
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,550
just years and years of abuse at my 
cartilage is gone on the shoulder now.

1000
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:11,551
My college has gone on the knee and I 
didn't really know anything about stem 

1001
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:12,730
cell about two weeks ago.
And now that's what I'm hearing about.

1002
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,290
Oh,
well I have a podcast.

1003
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:19,291
I'll send you and it was me and Dr 
Rhonda Magee that we did about a month 

1004
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:19,390
ago.
Fabulous.

1005
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:24,750
He's amazing and again he's.
He's well up to date with the latest 

1006
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:28,130
technology and he's also very 
conservative in his approach to it,

1007
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:33,130
but what he's saying is that they are 
able to regenerate cartilage and 

1008
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:37,121
meniscus tissue and this is the first 
time anything has ever come along that 

1009
00:50:37,121 --> 00:50:40,721
actually regenerates these tissue.
They've been able to trim it and do 

1010
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:43,991
things to it to mitigate pain,
but now they can literally regenerate 

1011
00:50:43,991 --> 00:50:45,860
tissue there.
Even injecting it into people's discs.

1012
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:50,840
Now the discs in the spine and they're 
showing that they can regrow disc tissue

1013
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:54,080
yet,
but you've just nailed my three issues.

1014
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,610
This issue and cartilage.
Yeah,

1015
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:01,540
that's the only issue is of course 
meniscus and cartilage and disk and what

1016
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:06,541
have you got going on with your back is 
the traditional issue with those three 

1017
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,200
c,
whatever the ankles at the bottom of the

1018
00:51:09,201 --> 00:51:14,201
bag.
I'm going to show you something else 

1019
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:14,201
that you're gonna need and you're going 
to get after we have this conversation.

1020
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:17,630
I have a machine out back called the 
reverse hyper and it was created by this

1021
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:22,930
mad genius named Louie Simmons and what 
the reverse hypers and machine that 

1022
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,580
decompresses your back and also 
strengthens at the same time.

1023
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:29,880
It decompresses it on the downswing and 
then on the upswing it,

1024
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,120
it strengthens all those muscles around 
it,

1025
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:36,260
but it literally pulls the back apart 
and the compressed discs,

1026
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:40,610
which is bad posture,
load a generation.

1027
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,840
You can look up at the screen.
This is,

1028
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:47,170
this guy's fucking crazy.
He's one of the craziest people I've 

1029
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,231
ever interviewed who was hilarious,
but he's a old time power lifter has 

1030
00:51:50,231 --> 00:51:51,770
been doing it forever.
I mean he's got fake shoulders,

1031
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:53,810
fake knees.
Everything's blown out.

1032
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,050
He has no biceps.
Biceps are completely severed off of his

1033
00:51:57,051 --> 00:51:58,010
arm.
He.

1034
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,840
What was he saying like He.
He was,

1035
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,900
he had his friends were making a Max out
bench like five days after his shoulder 

1036
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,540
replacement.
He's a fucking maniac,

1037
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:10,810
but they were trying to fuse his discs 
and so he came up with this machine and 

1038
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,190
you see as it swings down,
when she's swinging down,

1039
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,860
it's pulling her back apart,
like go to the.

1040
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,750
Here you go.
When it's going down,

1041
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:22,751
it's pulling the back,
an active decompression and as she's 

1042
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:24,770
swinging up,
she's strengthening all those muscles in

1043
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:28,550
the spine in a real weird way where you 
really can't get at them.

1044
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,720
And was it.
This is the efficient because you can do

1045
00:52:30,721 --> 00:52:32,900
the suit might superficially I'm 
struggling there,

1046
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:37,250
but the coal underneath the superficial 
muscles to had the MRI.

1047
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:41,590
You could see all the fat in the 
surrounding muscle,

1048
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:46,690
a muscle around the discs and you could 
see the fat in it and then as soon as 

1049
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,930
you hit the superficial,
you went,

1050
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:48,560
oh,
that's fun.

1051
00:52:48,561 --> 00:52:49,850
There's nothing wrong with the 
superficial,

1052
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,360
so it's a need away.
A lot this year.

1053
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,840
Just buy one of those men were you have 
to beast through.

1054
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,230
You'll superficial muscles to get to 
your colon muscles.

1055
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,640
Well,
it's just it.

1056
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:07,110
It forces that area of the body to work 
like you're sustaining a load and you 

1057
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:10,410
can you lift it up and you hold it in 
that position and then as you let it go,

1058
00:53:10,411 --> 00:53:15,411
it's,
it's decompressing and in the 

1059
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:15,411
decompressed cycle you,
you,

1060
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:19,581
you're feeling your muscles relaxed and 
you can actually feel it pulling like 

1061
00:53:19,581 --> 00:53:21,170
you feel in the lower back in a weird 
way.

1062
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:26,380
You feel it kind of polling and 
separating and then a couple of seconds 

1063
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,411
later you're and again,
and then you pull the and separated and 

1064
00:53:29,411 --> 00:53:32,391
you're strengthened again,
and then I have another thing out back 

1065
00:53:32,391 --> 00:53:35,061
that I bend over from the waist on and 
it allows my lower back to just 

1066
00:53:35,061 --> 00:53:39,891
completely relax and my upper body pulls
down on my lower body and it separates 

1067
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:42,870
and decompresses the lower spine.
I mean,

1068
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:44,940
it's been tremendous.
A huge,

1069
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:49,941
huge asset,
but there's a bunch of things they can 

1070
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:49,941
do.
Now.

1071
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:49,941
If you heard a Regena cane,
do you know what that is?

1072
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:50,280
No.
Regena.

1073
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:55,281
Kina is something that was developed in 
Germany that a lot of professional 

1074
00:53:55,281 --> 00:53:58,491
athletes like coby Brian Mann and they 
went over there and it's a blood 

1075
00:53:58,491 --> 00:54:00,240
spinning procedures similar to platelet 
rich plasma,

1076
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:03,930
but they take the blood and as they're 
spinning it,

1077
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:06,210
they heated it up and when they heat it 
up,

1078
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:11,430
the blood has a reaction to the extreme 
heat like it thinks you have a fever,

1079
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:15,270
so it produces is very intense anti 
inflammatory response.

1080
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,100
Obviously if you're a scientist or a 
doctor,

1081
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:22,101
I'm butchering this,
but then they take this yellow serum 

1082
00:54:22,101 --> 00:54:24,150
which is this an anti inflammatory 
response and they can inject it into all

1083
00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:29,151
these areas that you have massive 
inflammation like bulging discs and it 

1084
00:54:29,151 --> 00:54:33,111
has incredible effect.
Had incredible effect for Peyton 

1085
00:54:33,111 --> 00:54:36,140
Manning,
allowed them to get back to football 

1086
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,551
again.
I had a bulging disc that was making my 

1087
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:39,741
hands go numb.
Totally went away through decompression 

1088
00:54:39,741 --> 00:54:40,170
and through this kind of stuff.
Yeah,

1089
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,680
I heard this added 10 years to Kobe's 
career.

1090
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,670
Am I thinking?
Yeah,

1091
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,260
that's what he thinks.
Yeah,

1092
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:47,430
she didn't.
I didn't up until I'm 48,

1093
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:49,530
[inaudible] 49,
almost 50.

1094
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:54,570
Oh,
so I didn't think about any of these 

1095
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,670
things until this year,
so I accepted a acl,

1096
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,580
has bit of a nuisance

1097
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,360
except the garb of a creaky bank.
But in the last month I went to my,

1098
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:09,470
something happened to my knee and I went
to the doctor a little a x ray and he 

1099
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:12,160
went,
well,

1100
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:16,350
it cut up right for the 10th time I've 
had an operation on that knee,

1101
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,280
but you better off now waiting of 
waiting for what to like if you knew 

1102
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,950
what a canal.
So he's talking about a replacement.

1103
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:29,010
So you're talking about replacement now 
he's saying just hold on.

1104
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,500
Right?
So you're saying in 15 years from now or

1105
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:34,350
whatever it is.
But it all changed.

1106
00:55:34,351 --> 00:55:36,180
And then a month after I went and had 
the shoulder,

1107
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,110
um,
x,

1108
00:55:37,111 --> 00:55:38,850
right.
And he looked at it and went,

1109
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,190
well,
it could operate under,

1110
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:46,320
knew where we would go in here.
You better apply until I give you a new 

1111
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:46,320
one.
Um,

1112
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,220
now that Giza were

1113
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,720
talking about fixing,
told you about giving me new ones right 

1114
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:52,720
now I hadn't.
So you know,

1115
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,070
Ivan out there knows exactly what you're
talking about.

1116
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:00,700
To me the word,
he wasn't a vessel to receive this 

1117
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,801
information.
Now in the last month I'm ready to 

1118
00:56:02,801 --> 00:56:07,721
receive this information.
So in the next three months I will know 

1119
00:56:07,721 --> 00:56:12,150
of what you talk about immediately.
I'm going to connect you with Dr Rodney 

1120
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:16,600
Mcgee.
As soon as we get off the phone or off 

1121
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,281
the podcast here,
I'm going to connect you with them and 

1122
00:56:18,281 --> 00:56:18,281
he'll,
he'll be able to keep you abreast of all

1123
00:56:18,281 --> 00:56:20,150
the stuff.
And it changes constantly.

1124
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:24,730
Like when I first went,
I first got a shot in July of last year

1125
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,850
and I was that close to surgery.
I was trying to figure,

1126
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,350
okay,
I was planning my time.

1127
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:29,890
I was saying,
okay,

1128
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:34,891
if I get the surgery I essentially can't
use this arm for at least a few weeks 

1129
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,240
and it's going to be pretty weak for at 
least three months.

1130
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,910
And I was really accepting that and he 
said,

1131
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:44,911
well let's just give this a shot.
And within a couple of weeks of getting 

1132
00:56:44,911 --> 00:56:44,911
the shot,
I was like,

1133
00:56:44,911 --> 00:56:49,500
God damn,
this thing feels better than it's ever 

1134
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,350
felt before.
And so through a series of exercises,

1135
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:55,351
like a lot of rotator cuff strengthening
exercises and I'm a bottoms up kettle 

1136
00:56:56,741 --> 00:57:01,741
bells like where you.
You have to stabilize the kettlebells 

1137
00:57:01,741 --> 00:57:01,741
ones.
Those are those.

1138
00:57:01,741 --> 00:57:02,620
Those are fantastic for stabilization 
muscles.

1139
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:07,890
And then it also made me realize that if
you're going to do something along the 

1140
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:07,960
lines of Jujitsu,
something,

1141
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:10,960
it's very physically demanding.
You have to strengthen your machine.

1142
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,240
I can't.
You can't just keep going to Jujitsu,

1143
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,850
which is what I was doing for years.
Me Too.

1144
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,770
That was my exercise.
I don't think that's adequate.

1145
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:22,830
I think you have to strengthen the 
machine and I think yoga is also a 

1146
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:26,220
really big and important part of 
strengthening that machine because it's 

1147
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:29,920
lengthening,
decompressing the spine and it's making 

1148
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,040
you strong in these static positions,
which is very similar to the load that's

1149
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:36,810
going to be pushed on those joints.
And on your back when you're doing job

1150
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:39,370
to a traunch,
you go for a year.

1151
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:44,371
I tried every day because usually I can 
get into anything at some point or 

1152
00:57:44,371 --> 00:57:44,371
another.
You've got to keep throwing enough hours

1153
00:57:44,371 --> 00:57:48,271
at it.
The one thing I couldn't get into 

1154
00:57:48,271 --> 00:57:48,790
couldn't do it.
Maybe my approach was wrong.

1155
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:50,560
I was doing the [inaudible],
my ex wife,

1156
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,220
and it was incredibly painful,
incredibly challenging,

1157
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:58,300
but while on come out and fight is 
competitive element of it,

1158
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,680
there's my enemy.
I can have a role around.

1159
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:01,580
With Miami,
there's a tap,

1160
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,600
there's winners and losers,
and for some reason that keeps me 

1161
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:06,600
motivated.
The idea,

1162
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:11,450
I mean in essence,
I imagine it's the what I was talking 

1163
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:11,620
about in the end,
it's,

1164
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,060
it's self again,
self.

1165
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:18,510
With Yoga,
I just haven't made it that far to 

1166
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:22,530
access that struggle and enjoy it.
I feel like I'm always running on fumes 

1167
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:23,530
and yoga.

1168
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,260
Yeah,
well you got to run on fumes,

1169
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,340
but it's.
It's building a house,

1170
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:30,110
one layer of paint at a time.
I mean it's.

1171
00:58:30,111 --> 00:58:32,920
It's not a,
it's not an easy thing to do and I think

1172
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:37,921
that competitive element that you're 
talking about is an internal struggle 

1173
00:58:37,921 --> 00:58:39,430
and that internal struggle is you and 
your breath.

1174
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:44,940
Keeping your breath and calm and check 
and focusing entirely on your breath 

1175
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:50,040
while managing the positions and then 
slowly but surely developing more 

1176
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,240
proficiency in those positions.
More range of motion,

1177
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:57,241
more dexterity,
keep going over and over again and then 

1178
00:58:57,241 --> 00:59:00,500
one day you get to a point.
For me it was like maybe a year and a 

1179
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,900
half into doing it pretty regularly 
while I'm like,

1180
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:05,170
okay,
now I can finally hold this position for

1181
00:59:05,171 --> 00:59:10,171
30 seconds.
Whereas before I would literally count 

1182
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:12,670
to 10 and just try to get to 10 and then
I'd fall down and then I get back up and

1183
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:13,380
try again.

1184
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:16,210
Try to get to 10 and try to get my feet 
would buckle,

1185
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,450
my knee wouldn't be locked out and then 
I'd try again.

1186
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:22,370
Once you develop a certain of 
proficiency,

1187
00:59:22,371 --> 00:59:27,371
then you can concentrate entirely on the
breath and that's where the real 

1188
00:59:27,371 --> 00:59:29,570
struggle is.
And then keeping the mind on track.

1189
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:34,690
Not Thinking about other bullshit.
Now thinking about the just just the 

1190
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:38,831
struggle of life and all the different 
variables that you have to deal with on 

1191
00:59:38,831 --> 00:59:38,990
a daily basis.
Thinking only of the breath,

1192
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:44,170
the posture and the breath,
very difficult to keep on track so that 

1193
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:45,260
invariant,
that's the competitive struggle.

1194
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:46,160
It's in your home.

1195
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:49,490
See a consistency with the theme though.
That theme is this,

1196
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:54,730
that that's all there is,
is the outside world of the noise and 

1197
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:57,260
what comes with that and there's the 
internal self,

1198
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:02,770
but everything is.
Everything is subject to these rules and

1199
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:07,990
yoga in this sense is no difference.
Jujitsu's no different narrative is no 

1200
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:10,580
different.
It's being aware of what the dynamic is.

1201
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,560
It's being aware of what's actually 
going on.

1202
01:00:12,561 --> 01:00:14,990
That I think is fundamental.
Yes,

1203
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,580
yes.
I'm pattern recognition.

1204
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,880
Recognizing that it's the same for yoga 
is for the essence of a narrative.

1205
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:22,720
Absolutely.

1206
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:27,970
Yeah,
and those things become a vehicle for 

1207
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:30,041
developing your human potential,
whether it's yoga or whether it's 

1208
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:32,711
Jujitsu and I think pattern recognition.
It's they take place in bold things in 

1209
01:00:32,711 --> 01:00:33,170
yoga.
You Go,

1210
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,520
okay,
I've been here before,

1211
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,230
I know where this is,
I know I know what to do,

1212
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:39,530
and you go right back into that thing of
concentrating on controlling the breath.

1213
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:44,800
These big long,
deep breaths and these big long exhales 

1214
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,390
and then the focus is entirely on the 
breath and those patterns,

1215
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,050
they come up in Jujitsu as well that 
that ability to maintain breath.

1216
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,200
I mean,
I'm sure you've recognized that in a 

1217
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,420
person who just starts,
like one of the things you see about 

1218
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:58,420
someone who's just starting,
even if they're athletic,

1219
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,990
they don't know what they're doing.
They started hyperventilating.

1220
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,430
They don't know what to do.
They start breathing weird and they.

1221
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:07,460
The breath is like the first thing that 
you lose control over and Hickson from 

1222
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,651
the movie choke.
I mean that was the big thing that 

1223
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:12,380
separated Hickson from all the other 
Jujitsu players is yoga.

1224
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,550
Yeah.
His Yoga.

1225
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:14,810
He made yoga sexy.

1226
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:15,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

1227
01:01:15,841 --> 01:01:16,260
He,
well,

1228
01:01:16,261 --> 01:01:20,010
he was the first guy to make it 
appealing at all to martial artists.

1229
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,630
I mean,
that was with your wife did.

1230
01:01:21,631 --> 01:01:24,270
That's what your mom does.
It's what the housewives do.

1231
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,480
It's not something that a man does,
especially not the top Jujitsu killer 

1232
01:01:29,761 --> 01:01:30,180
ever.

1233
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:35,290
It was a seminal.
It was a seminal documentary that 

1234
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,530
changed a lot of people's lives and it 
sort of turned hixon into a rockstar.

1235
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:38,800
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1236
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:40,290
yeah.
I've had him in here.

1237
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,450
He's an.
He's an amazing guy to talk to.

1238
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,120
I've had him.
I've talked to him several times,

1239
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:50,121
but having him in here and sitting down 
with him and talking to him about 

1240
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:50,121
Jujitsu,
it's like,

1241
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:52,800
it's like the.
It's like sitting down with Michelangelo

1242
01:01:52,801 --> 01:01:57,801
and talking about art.
I mean you're talking about there's 

1243
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:01,700
masters and then there's the master of 
the masters and if you talk to any 

1244
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,580
Jujitsu master,
they all just go.

1245
01:02:02,581 --> 01:02:04,980
Hixon is the number one thing.
There's no dispute,

1246
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,100
which is amazing.
There's very few,

1247
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:13,160
like there's soccer players that are 
just elite and there's basketball 

1248
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,200
players that are elite,
but when it comes to like who's the best

1249
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:20,190
in Jujitsu,
there was always this one and while

1250
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,110
he was competitive and especially while 
he was young,

1251
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:27,320
it was always Hixon,
which is to me amazing that he was able 

1252
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:31,191
to maintain.
And I think one of the things about him 

1253
01:02:31,191 --> 01:02:35,480
was his physicality and his mind and I 
think those two things in many ways were

1254
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:41,301
enhanced by yoga.
I think he's got some disc issues now 

1255
01:02:41,301 --> 01:02:41,301
that it doesn't.
It has quite a few.

1256
01:02:41,301 --> 01:02:42,000
He has quite a few.
Yeah,

1257
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:45,060
I think he has eight bulging discs,
which is horrific.

1258
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:46,590
Maybe you should send him to your mind.
Oh,

1259
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:47,850
I'm going to 100 percent.
I mean,

1260
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:49,350
I've talked to him about a bunch of 
things.

1261
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:53,610
Hixon those are a bit reluctant for 
certain kinds of treatment,

1262
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:54,760
you know,
I mean,

1263
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:59,810
he's a,
he's just gonna eat mangoes and fucking 

1264
01:02:59,810 --> 01:02:59,810
meditate and Shit.
I Dunno,

1265
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:00,850
I dunno what he's,
uh,

1266
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:01,990
what is,
uh,

1267
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,710
what he's tried or what he's willing to 
try.

1268
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:06,710
But I would love to see him.
I mean,

1269
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,160
I would love to see him rolling again.
I mean,

1270
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:13,161
that would be amazing if they could 
regenerate this tissue to the point 

1271
01:03:13,161 --> 01:03:13,740
where he would be healthy.
I mean,

1272
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,760
that's the fear.
The fear for the first time for me is 

1273
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,740
that I've never felt any version of age 
on the mat.

1274
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:23,160
But when people are starting to tell me,
oh,

1275
01:03:23,161 --> 01:03:24,900
we're not going to fix it,
we're gonna wait until we give you a new

1276
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:25,570
one.
Okay.

1277
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:28,980
What side of the this night and when 
they're saying that about your knee,

1278
01:03:28,981 --> 01:03:30,750
what is the issue?
Is that a meniscus issue?

1279
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,360
Um,
it is a meniscus issue,

1280
01:03:33,361 --> 01:03:36,420
but I've lost 75 percent of the meniscus
of the cartilage.

1281
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,600
I get confused between the difference 
cartilage or meniscus.

1282
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:43,020
What is the different cartilage is what 
covers the outside of the bone?

1283
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:48,230
Meniscus has the padding essentially 
that's in between the two bones that 

1284
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,990
keeps them from touching each other.

1285
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:50,790
Right.
Okay.

1286
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:53,130
So they have both.
So it goes bone,

1287
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,320
meniscus,
cartilage,

1288
01:03:55,321 --> 01:03:56,460
cartilage,
meniscus,

1289
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:59,940
the Meniscus,
you can cut some of it out.

1290
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,780
But when you didn't have had that done,
um,

1291
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,200
my left knee,
they,

1292
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:05,150
they did,
uh,

1293
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:10,170
you know,
they go in arthroscopically and they 

1294
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:10,170
trim some of the torn meniscus.
Yeah,

1295
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:10,170
it's,
it's,

1296
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,750
it works.
But if it's less stable,

1297
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:17,900
there's less tissue in there.
It's more subject to inflammation and 

1298
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,560
swelling.
It doesn't handle the load as well.

1299
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:23,430
But I got stem cell shot into there and 
I've never had a problem since.

1300
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:25,500
It's amazing.
I had a problem with it for.

1301
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:30,770
I mean I tore it for the first time a 
more than 20 years ago and had an 

1302
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:36,741
operation I think in [inaudible] 95,
somewhere around there and then I had 

1303
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:40,590
another operation on it in 2001,
2002 and it was.

1304
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,940
It's always been an issue since then.

1305
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,280
It's just one of those things that he 
gets sore.

1306
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:49,281
I just deal with it.
Whether it's kickboxing or whether it's 

1307
01:04:49,281 --> 01:04:49,560
lifting weights or whether it's Jujitsu,
it gets sore.

1308
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:53,760
I just deal with it.
I take glucosamine and Chondroitin and a

1309
01:04:53,761 --> 01:04:56,850
lot of fish oil and antiinflammatories 
and changing.

1310
01:04:56,851 --> 01:05:01,851
My Diet helped quite a bit,
but there was always that thing until 

1311
01:05:01,851 --> 01:05:05,420
they shot the stem cells in there and 
then literally within a few months it's 

1312
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:06,960
nonexistent.
Like I don't think I have this need that

1313
01:05:06,961 --> 01:05:09,540
acts up anymore.
Now I have a knee that never acts up.

1314
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:12,390
It just doesn't bother me anymore.
This is very exciting stuff.

1315
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:17,420
It's very exciting stuff.
And Tell me how thin I'm on the wedge in

1316
01:05:17,441 --> 01:05:17,980
terms of

1317
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,050
this being new.
Well,

1318
01:05:20,051 --> 01:05:25,051
they've been doing it and experimenting 
with it for a couple of decades 

1319
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:28,291
apparently according to Dr Mcgee,
but the understanding of the potential 

1320
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:32,251
and the possibilities and then the 
practical application as over the last 

1321
01:05:32,251 --> 01:05:33,850
10 years has really come to the 
forefront.

1322
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:36,640
It's really become something very,
very viable.

1323
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It's not just theoretical anymore.
Now they're actually seeing people 

1324
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,211
regenerating tissue.
They're seeing people where you have a 

1325
01:05:45,211 --> 01:05:46,150
tear in your shoulder or something like 
that and then go out and you're probably

1326
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,650
going to have to get surgery.
No.

1327
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:52,651
Then they shoot it in there and then 
next thing you know it a couple months 

1328
01:05:52,651 --> 01:05:55,740
later,
I mean I still got some floating tissue 

1329
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:56,110
that like pops and crunches and stuff 
and my shoulder.

1330
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,480
But when it comes to like the actual 
strength in my shoulder,

1331
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:01,000
I don't worry about it at all.
Like it doesn't bother me.

1332
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:06,010
I mean there's,
there's occasionally some light 

1333
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:08,641
soreness,
but as far as like the functional 

1334
01:06:08,641 --> 01:06:09,250
strength of the shoulder,
it's like 100 percent.

1335
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:14,280
It's crazy.
So is this the thin end of the wage 

1336
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:14,280
then?
So is this gonna,

1337
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:17,380
is this gonna turn into one of those 
exponential?

1338
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:18,670
It is.
Oh,

1339
01:06:18,671 --> 01:06:19,750
for sure.
For sure.

1340
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:20,990
They're already generating.
They.

1341
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:23,200
They built this woman.
This is very exciting.

1342
01:06:23,201 --> 01:06:25,300
It's tough.
It's as exciting as it gets.

1343
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:28,240
The regenerating tissue,
they're real regenerate body parts.

1344
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:31,000
They built this woman a bladder.
She had a.

1345
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:34,920
They took skin cells,
stem cells from the skin and they with a

1346
01:06:34,921 --> 01:06:38,050
p in a petri dish.
They started this off and then built her

1347
01:06:38,051 --> 01:06:43,051
a boy.
She had bladder cancer and they built 

1348
01:06:43,051 --> 01:06:43,600
her a bladder and then put it in her 
body and it's functional.

1349
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:49,050
It's amazing.
I mean this is all state of the art now 

1350
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:50,320
and when we're looking at like 10,
20,

1351
01:06:50,321 --> 01:06:55,321
30 years from now,
I mean you're looking at potentially 

1352
01:06:55,321 --> 01:06:57,661
regenerating all sorts of things,
regenerating bone from people who have 

1353
01:06:57,661 --> 01:07:01,621
bone cancer,
regenerating lungs and liver and spleen 

1354
01:07:01,621 --> 01:07:01,621
and heart.

1355
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:06,720
I mean,
they're going to be able to make body 

1356
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:06,720
parts.
They've created an artificial heart that

1357
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:10,981
beats like with stem cells.
They've actually constructed a human 

1358
01:07:10,981 --> 01:07:13,060
heart.
This is a subject,

1359
01:07:13,061 --> 01:07:13,570
you know,
selling,

1360
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:15,430
you're bound to,
fascinated by it,

1361
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:20,520
fascinated by it,
because what they're able to do now is 

1362
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:20,520
just a,
you know,

1363
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:25,501
you're just looking into the future.
You get a window into this and it seems 

1364
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:28,510
like it's exponentially exploding.
I mean all over the world.

1365
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:33,511
There's people experimenting with this 
stuff and trying to figure out new ways 

1366
01:07:33,511 --> 01:07:36,601
to improve things,
which is the fact that I'm having that 

1367
01:07:36,601 --> 01:07:39,021
conversation and this isn't the first 
conversation I've had in the last month 

1368
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:39,021
about this.
Yeah,

1369
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:40,240
it's pot.
There's aunt gus.

1370
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:40,870
No.
Oh,

1371
01:07:40,871 --> 01:07:45,871
it is now.
People are understanding it and people 

1372
01:07:45,871 --> 01:07:45,871
know people that have had issues with 
it.

1373
01:07:45,871 --> 01:07:46,930
Um,
you can't get it in America,

1374
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:49,540
but in Mexico,
I know people that go over there and get

1375
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:52,840
it done intravenously and uh,
you know,

1376
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:55,630
boss route and you know,
boss boss route and the way he described

1377
01:07:55,631 --> 01:07:56,970
on this big character,
he's like.

1378
01:07:57,310 --> 01:08:00,010
And it was like I had energy coming off 
my fingertips.

1379
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:06,180
I had some pretty significant problems.
He's got fused disks in his neck and he 

1380
01:08:07,391 --> 01:08:12,391
had major atrophy in his arm because his
disc was compressed and they.

1381
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,100
It was pushing on the nerves so the 
nerves

1382
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,190
weren't getting.
They weren't firing correctly,

1383
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:24,340
so his right arm,
he calls baby arm because his right arm 

1384
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,530
has kind of shrunk and so he's 
experimented with a lot of these things.

1385
01:08:25,531 --> 01:08:27,080
He's kind of been ahead of the curve 
with this stuff.

1386
01:08:28,530 --> 01:08:31,710
You should get Jason Statham and I would
love to you,

1387
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,210
right?
Yeah.

1388
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:40,430
It's very similar.
These go a couple of tweaks here and 

1389
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:40,430
there.
I met him.

1390
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:44,290
He's a nice guy.
He had a bunch of stuff going on with 

1391
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:44,290
his body too.
I'm sure he's a martial artist.

1392
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:46,940
Better condition now.
He used to be an Olympic diver.

1393
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:50,020
You should die for England.
You know one of those,

1394
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:55,710
right?
I'm fabulous athlete and he takes care 

1395
01:08:56,361 --> 01:08:57,440
of himself.
I believe it.

1396
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,690
A good name,
but you know he's got tweaks,

1397
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,960
got their own knee.
That just never quite goes away.

1398
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,070
Little thing that he does his much and 
by the way,

1399
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:09,260
get him on diet and he's off to the 
races.

1400
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:10,990
You can't shut him up.
He's got,

1401
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:13,460
you know,
leave him there for three hours,

1402
01:09:13,461 --> 01:09:17,780
come back kind of cutlet.
We still banging on about it.

1403
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,960
It's something that he cares profoundly,
but I can tell you now we're sitting in 

1404
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,550
now there'll be a battle about you 
couldn't.

1405
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,880
Who was good to say what to whom because
you'd talk over one another.

1406
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,040
Um,
you should get him in,

1407
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:33,530
in a way he relate to best,
you know,

1408
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:34,070
I'm sure.

1409
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:36,440
Do you watch your diet?
Are you a healthy eater?

1410
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:40,010
Not as healthy as I'd like to be.
I'd go up and down.

1411
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:45,040
I play.
I also liked with 30 pounds of extra 

1412
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:45,280
nonsense.
It's on.

1413
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:46,210
Yeah.
Um,

1414
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:50,810
now I'm weighing 190.
Now I should get one 92 actually today.

1415
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:54,770
And I should be creeping around a good 
fight and weigh about one slash 78.

1416
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,810
So what is it?
Is it a booze Buddhist thing?

1417
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:03,340
It's not the booze.
The booze isn't the issue in terms of 

1418
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,801
the canneries itself.
The booze is the window to the calories 

1419
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:05,801
itself.
The pizza,

1420
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:10,300
the pizza pizza man.
But I do love a pub or a pub or they 

1421
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:12,680
love a pump and a,
a pack of crisps.

1422
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,800
You don't really have packet kitty corn 
chips over here.

1423
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,730
Not Quite the same thing.
They're not,

1424
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:21,760
they don't know an English,
an English crisp is a heavyweight chip.

1425
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:27,790
Um,
and they worked particularly well in 

1426
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,641
pop.
So it's two pints of Guinness and a 

1427
01:10:30,641 --> 01:10:32,431
couple of packs of crisps.
And you've it in a thousand calories is 

1428
01:10:32,431 --> 01:10:33,350
complete nonsense in all about 22 
minutes.

1429
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,080
I'm the salt to is very appealing where 
you're drinking a cold thing,

1430
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:42,590
just work chances each other,
but it didn't take long before.

1431
01:10:42,591 --> 01:10:44,450
There's a heavy price tag that comes 
with that.

1432
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:50,030
I train the law,
recognized train weights three times a 

1433
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:53,180
week and finding bread on the three 
times a week.

1434
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:58,750
I love training Kebab and it's trying to
somehow reconcile that.

1435
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:06,941
And every now and then I'll behave 
myself a stay at the pub style off the 

1436
01:11:06,941 --> 01:11:08,300
booze for three months and I couldn't 
get myself down to one 78.

1437
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:10,610
However,
it's been five,

1438
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:15,611
six years since I've been there.
Now I dropped eight pounds the other 

1439
01:11:15,611 --> 01:11:20,061
day.
Strictly I was strict with myself off 

1440
01:11:20,061 --> 01:11:22,470
the booze because I'm off the booze.
I don't look at food in the same way.

1441
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:25,320
The thing that the whole purpose of 
boozers to relax trouble is as well.

1442
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:27,650
Also reluctance to the rules.
Right?

1443
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,560
Right.
Now,

1444
01:11:30,561 --> 01:11:33,050
when you're dealing with all these 
injuries,

1445
01:11:33,051 --> 01:11:38,051
how are you able to train through all 
the stuff you've got to shoulder they 

1446
01:11:38,051 --> 01:11:38,690
think in one day might need to be 
replaced and needs that might need to be

1447
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:39,190
gone.

1448
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:40,520
Crack on.
Yeah.

1449
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:44,390
I found that and I'm sure you've had the
same through Jujitsu.

1450
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,300
Whenever I get an injury,
a font,

1451
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:49,690
if you stop messing around with it and 
paying too much attention to it,

1452
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:54,260
it kind of don't go on for longer.
Nine or 10 million injuries are just try

1453
01:11:54,261 --> 01:11:59,261
and through and there's almost a 
bluffing game that you have with the 

1454
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:02,981
injury who was in charge had mailed the 
injury and once the injury knows that 

1455
01:12:02,981 --> 01:12:03,490
you mean it.
It tends to move,

1456
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:06,590
walk out the door,
but there are more fundamental ones like

1457
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:11,710
the shoulder and then the next,
and I shouldn't say that actually has 

1458
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:13,430
been giving me a bit of aggro recently.
Um,

1459
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:15,430
so there were a few things that you need
to take it serious.

1460
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:18,620
Now I can see you're onto this job.
I can see you're focused on this.

1461
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:19,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

1462
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:20,970
I know a lot about this stuff.
Yeah.

1463
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:24,000
But you're invested.
Yes.

1464
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,150
Right.
And you need to be invested.

1465
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,730
If you mean it is,
it's ownership again,

1466
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:30,200
your investment is ownership.

1467
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:35,280
Well,
my good friend Eddie Bravo just at his 

1468
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,261
disc replaced.
He had to replace with a titanium 

1469
01:12:37,261 --> 01:12:40,321
articulating lower back disc.
So he had some pretty significant disc 

1470
01:12:40,321 --> 01:12:42,400
decompression or compression issues,
uh,

1471
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:47,430
in deterioration.
And it got to the point where his lower 

1472
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:47,430
back was just constantly inflamed.
You know,

1473
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,100
Eddie's worldclass blackpoll.
Yeah.

1474
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:52,380
He just couldn't come anymore.
Why didn't you send them to you?

1475
01:12:52,381 --> 01:12:57,381
Oh Man.
Well it was before they were actually 

1476
01:12:57,381 --> 01:12:57,381
shooting it into the desk.
He had it done about a year ago,

1477
01:12:57,381 --> 01:12:58,090
about a year ago,
eight,

1478
01:12:58,091 --> 01:12:59,250
nine months ago,
something like that.

1479
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,870
So this might be one that whether you 
just hang on.

1480
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:04,180
Yeah,
I would say with stem cells,

1481
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:05,530
with a lot of things,
hang on,

1482
01:13:05,531 --> 01:13:09,790
what some things you can hang on like a 
acl tears once the tear,

1483
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:13,260
once the ligament is removed you.
There's nothing you can do.

1484
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:15,100
You have to ever replace a terrible 
thing.

1485
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:18,010
Yeah.
The acl and it's such a common injury,

1486
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:20,380
but you know what's interesting is once 
you get it replaced.

1487
01:13:20,381 --> 01:13:23,530
Like for me,
I had a Patella tendon graft on the left

1488
01:13:23,531 --> 01:13:28,531
knee and then a cadaver graft on the 
right knee and had all sorts of things 

1489
01:13:28,811 --> 01:13:29,060
done.
They.

1490
01:13:29,061 --> 01:13:32,020
I've done it all,
but neither one of them bother me at all

1491
01:13:32,021 --> 01:13:33,340
anymore.
And they're stronger.

1492
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,380
Like the,
the.

1493
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,600
When they do a cadaver graft,
they use the Achilles tendon,

1494
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:42,220
which is a 150 plus percent stronger 
than your original acl.

1495
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,100
So it actually makes it a stronger 
joint,

1496
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:47,260
right?
Melinda's.

1497
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:47,600
No.

1498
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:49,020
Yeah.
Well,

1499
01:13:49,021 --> 01:13:54,021
the Patella tendon graft is still 
stronger than when they use a Patella 

1500
01:13:54,021 --> 01:13:57,111
tendon graft that is still strong in 
your patella tendon is a very huge 

1501
01:13:57,111 --> 01:14:00,351
tendon and you can,
you can operate with a third of it 

1502
01:14:00,351 --> 01:14:04,161
missing,
which is essentially what they cut out 

1503
01:14:04,161 --> 01:14:04,161
when they

1504
01:14:04,161 --> 01:14:05,280
my right leg,
which has had the two acl,

1505
01:14:05,281 --> 01:14:10,281
so I've noticed is atrophied and there's
very little I can do to beef up that 

1506
01:14:10,281 --> 01:14:12,250
quad.
That's probably because you're favoring

1507
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,730
your left side.
Yeah.

1508
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,180
But then you know,
isolated and I'm beast the thing,

1509
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:20,170
but I just can't engage it.
I can't get it flat leg like a can on my

1510
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:21,760
left leg,
get it completely flat.

1511
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:24,190
Standard it.
So it bends.

1512
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:29,320
Yes.
Age or your courts does some stem cells 

1513
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,070
in that bad boy.
It's very exciting.

1514
01:14:30,071 --> 01:14:30,630
Sorry.
So yeah,

1515
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,200
it's,
it's the real deal.

1516
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:37,260
I mean it's something special.
Who's the years I've been living with 

1517
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:37,260
it?
Yeah.

1518
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:37,870
They can fix you up,
take a fixture up.

1519
01:14:37,871 --> 01:14:42,871
But diet is huge.
One of the things about diet is 

1520
01:14:42,871 --> 01:14:45,421
inflammation and I never really wrapped 
that in my head and to see about three 

1521
01:14:45,421 --> 01:14:49,861
or four years ago I had a pretty 
significant back injury and then just 

1522
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:53,680
say in my hands were numb and it was 
because I was ignoring it because I 

1523
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:54,840
would pinch it in Jujitsu and then I'd 
go,

1524
01:14:54,841 --> 01:14:56,080
oh,
it's still going to roll light.

1525
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:01,080
I'll just go in there and roll light and
then after awhile it was getting bad to 

1526
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,291
the point in my back was locking up and 
my hand started going numb and I give 

1527
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:07,351
this pretty significant elbow pain,
so I started really researching all the 

1528
01:15:07,451 --> 01:15:12,451
options and what's really going on in 
one of the big ones that I've found was 

1529
01:15:12,451 --> 01:15:13,690
diet.
That when you have too many inflammation

1530
01:15:13,691 --> 01:15:18,691
causing foods in your diet and reading 
too much sugar and bread and booze and 

1531
01:15:18,691 --> 01:15:20,420
all these different things that affects 
it.

1532
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:24,340
It affects like how your body carries 
fat,

1533
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:29,580
but it also affects where your body 
holds onto inflammation and joints in 

1534
01:15:29,681 --> 01:15:31,330
particular.
All the injuries,

1535
01:15:31,331 --> 01:15:34,690
spots were waste sore when I had a 
shitty diet.

1536
01:15:34,691 --> 01:15:36,280
So give me,
give me the evils.

1537
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:41,500
Um,
as Laird Hamilton calls them the three 

1538
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,430
white devils.
Sugar bread.

1539
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,280
What's the other one?
Yeah,

1540
01:15:45,281 --> 01:15:46,900
what is the other one?
Booze.

1541
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:52,080
The kind of white foam on bears.
White.

1542
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,030
What is it?
You should know what?

1543
01:15:55,031 --> 01:15:57,310
The three white flour.
Pasta,

1544
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,510
sugar.
I don't know.

1545
01:15:58,511 --> 01:15:59,650
What is either one.
Dairy.

1546
01:15:59,651 --> 01:16:00,360
I guess.
Mary.

1547
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:01,220
There you go.
Yeah.

1548
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:04,810
I like cheese though.
So do you don't drink alcohol?

1549
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:05,380
Yeah,
I do.

1550
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:07,780
Yeah,
we try not to drink too much.

1551
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,640
I mean it's like all things in 
moderation,

1552
01:16:09,641 --> 01:16:11,690
including moderation.
Yeah.

1553
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,780
I mean,
I'm not a big drinker.

1554
01:16:13,781 --> 01:16:15,400
I don't like.
I'm not drinking every night,

1555
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,550
but if I go out,
you know,

1556
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:21,160
and I have a drink or have a glass of 
wine with dinner or a couple of glasses,

1557
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:21,680
I'm,
I'm cool.

1558
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,920
I think it's just a matter of just 
controlling yourself.

1559
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:26,320
That's really the thing.
So,

1560
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,690
uh,
the three white devils,

1561
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:33,910
you do subscribe to three white devils.
I occasionally will allow myself to 

1562
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,960
dance with the devil,
but the little three of them.

1563
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:38,800
Yeah.
Well,

1564
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:43,810
a little bit of sugar,
a little bit like last night I had some 

1565
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:43,810
linguine with clams.
I don't.

1566
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:48,090
I go on an 80 slash 20,
which means 80 percent of my diet is 

1567
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:49,120
very clean and then 20 percent off fuck 
off,

1568
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:51,640
like whether it's Saturday or Friday or 
whatever.

1569
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:54,190
Had you feel about rural milk on 
posturized love.

1570
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,270
I Love Rob Melton.
I'm opening.

1571
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,230
I'm opening a little raw milk dairy.
Are you really?

1572
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,820
I am.
I'm having,

1573
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,560
I'm very interested in this health 
thing.

1574
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:08,080
I'm more from a culinary point of view 
that I am from a nutritional point of 

1575
01:17:08,531 --> 01:17:09,650
view.
However,

1576
01:17:09,651 --> 01:17:10,280
I suspect,

1577
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:13,070
I suspect that there's a sweet spot 
here.

1578
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:16,390
I'm opening a brewery.
I love a beer.

1579
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:18,770
You're opening a brewery to brewery?
Yeah.

1580
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,570
Which,
how much do you know about making beer?

1581
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,900
Yeah,
quite a lot actually.

1582
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,260
Have you been doing it on your own?

1583
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:28,280
Done all that sort of asking around 
underneath the stairs routine for years.

1584
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,350
Um,
which is great fun.

1585
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,650
I like any sort of form of caveman 
chemistry,

1586
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,530
Francis Mammon.
Mammon is,

1587
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:41,670
it's big fan of that sort of thing.
I'm a bit of a caveman when it comes to 

1588
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:42,920
anything to do with food,
so I do like a nice steak outside.

1589
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:48,360
I'll take my uncle if I say so myself.
I'm on good on a barbecue and I'd been.

1590
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,200
I'd been doing that barbecuing for 20 
years.

1591
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:53,060
Good.
On a slow cook.

1592
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:55,950
Take that quite seriously.
Um,

1593
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,020
but.
So yeah,

1594
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:00,590
only brewery beer.
And then when I'm on it I'm,

1595
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:01,880
I'm putting a butcher,
a baker,

1596
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:06,200
the candlestick makers to.
It's gotten a small hotel place in,

1597
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:07,580
uh,
in England.

1598
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:12,370
Fifteen hundred acres farm.
Got All that sort of nonsense going on.

1599
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:14,630
So you're going to do farm to table the 
whole deal.

1600
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:16,340
I'll make your beer.
Yeah.

1601
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:18,650
Raise your own animals.
Serve them.

1602
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:21,630
Yeah.
The whole thing just got to get into.

1603
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:22,420
So yeah.

1604
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:27,490
Yeah.
I mean jeans traditionally in English 

1605
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:27,490
drink,
but I wasn't really into it until I came

1606
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:29,900
to America and I've found since I've 
been here in the last,

1607
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:30,830
over the last week,

1608
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,850
it's been quite a few gin and tonics 
going on.

1609
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:34,710
Yeah.
And,

1610
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,800
and apparent is the easiest of the 
spirits to mix all my little swing on 

1611
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,921
that too.
I'm good friends with maynard keen in 

1612
01:18:42,921 --> 01:18:46,400
lead singer of tool and he went 
essentially for for years,

1613
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:49,490
just went and developed his own vineyard
at.

1614
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,570
Where is he?
Arizona.

1615
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:56,270
Yeah,
and not in a place in Arizona that's 

1616
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:58,611
known for growing wine,
so he had to manipulate the soil and a 

1617
01:18:58,611 --> 01:18:59,910
baby's having a lovely time.
He loves it.

1618
01:18:59,911 --> 01:19:01,110
Yeah.
He's probably quite an expensive,

1619
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:02,100
lovely time though,
isn't it?

1620
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:04,590
I'm sure he's making money with it now,
but he's.

1621
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:10,040
He's like a legitimate genius and he's 
one of those guys that he cannot be 

1622
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,490
stagnant.
It's not even an option.

1623
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:16,550
I mean his mind works a thousand miles 
an hour and when you're talking to him 

1624
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:20,421
you just kind of kind of jumped on the 
train and hang on there with them as 

1625
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:20,421
long as you can jump off and go,
Ooh.

1626
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,960
But he's just a very,
very,

1627
01:19:21,961 --> 01:19:24,180
very intense guy.
And his,

1628
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:29,510
his particular brand of intellectual 
curiosity led him to start experimenting

1629
01:19:30,781 --> 01:19:35,781
with one.
His wine is absolutely fantastic and 

1630
01:19:35,781 --> 01:19:38,331
these are legitimate wine expert like 
you sit here and talk to them the same 

1631
01:19:38,331 --> 01:19:40,400
way you and I can talk about boot 
Chechnya or Hadzic,

1632
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:41,240
racier,
Henzel.

1633
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:46,250
He can talk to you about why and he's 
also a purple belt in Jujitsu to so he 

1634
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:47,220
can talk to him.
He's an intense guy.

1635
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:50,640
I liked the sound of this.
The one business I do find interesting.

1636
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:52,180
There's something happen.

1637
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,030
Learning with the whole craft movement 
general,

1638
01:19:55,270 --> 01:20:00,270
that's very exciting that we are going 
back to local stuff and people to a 

1639
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:03,760
degree it's ownership again.
Yes.

1640
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:08,820
It's take ownership of your food,
take ownership of everything to do with 

1641
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:14,970
the important components of your life 
and it'll got robbed from us.

1642
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,580
Yeah.
You know,

1643
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:19,590
what happened in the seventies in the UK
is all these breweries bought up all the

1644
01:20:19,591 --> 01:20:24,591
pumps and they brought up all these 
small breweries and used to have all 

1645
01:20:24,591 --> 01:20:27,531
these breweries with their own little 
crafty beer going on and then they have 

1646
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:31,401
merchandised it and then he sold it back
to us and they gave it back to us with 

1647
01:20:31,401 --> 01:20:32,580
that character and we just bought it 
because we were stupid.

1648
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,050
Right?
Yeah.

1649
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:39,110
And then what's happening is we realized
that character is important and local 

1650
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:41,550
character is important and ownership is 
important.

1651
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,720
So there's this movement,
um,

1652
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:48,030
and to a degree things like instagram 
may have a dark side,

1653
01:20:48,031 --> 01:20:53,031
but it was as a light side is given a 
voice to the craft movement on like a 

1654
01:20:53,941 --> 01:20:55,230
man that makes his own knives.

1655
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,120
Yeah.
And followed any of that stuff.

1656
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,000
What are handmade knives?
All the time.

1657
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:03,420
That's what I use to like cut my food.
Like they feel good.

1658
01:21:03,421 --> 01:21:05,550
I like it.
It's a completely different experience.

1659
01:21:05,551 --> 01:21:06,870
I have exactly the same thing.

1660
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:11,980
We order a lot of army knives and when 
you're cutting your food with a handmade

1661
01:21:11,981 --> 01:21:14,650
knife,
it's not what it used to be.

1662
01:21:14,651 --> 01:21:16,700
You realize a knife should be a thing 
thing

1663
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:21,990
and it got robbed from us.
Do you know Steve Kramer is a number of 

1664
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:24,470
days a guy who makes knives with media 
rights?

1665
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:25,880
Yes,
I do know I've seen him.

1666
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,370
I said there's a little thing with 
Anthony Bourdain.

1667
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Say now I'm sitting there thinking the 
people dynamic he takes a chunk of it 

1668
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:34,450
came from space.
It's fabulous.

1669
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:35,480
Yeah,
it's amazing.

1670
01:21:35,481 --> 01:21:35,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

1671
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,090
I actually,
I got a feeling that might have been the

1672
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:41,020
genesis of my interest in knowledge with
antibody thing.

1673
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:44,000
There's a guy,
a mousy fire arts,

1674
01:21:44,001 --> 01:21:49,001
find that on Instagram,
but he just made me this Damascus steel 

1675
01:21:49,001 --> 01:21:49,880
cutting knife and uh,
on a hunting knife to go with it.

1676
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:51,770
And it's just.
I mean,

1677
01:21:51,771 --> 01:21:53,000
I cut with it,
but it's this.

1678
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:55,880
I stare at it for minutes before I cut 
with it.

1679
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:01,120
I look at the blade and the handle's 
made out a thousand year old bog would 

1680
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,220
like wood that was preserved from a 
Bhag,

1681
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:04,220
Bhag.

1682
01:22:04,370 --> 01:22:05,750
Maple.
It's amazing,

1683
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:08,450
this is amazing,
but why is it so interesting?

1684
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,580
But the faculty,
this is interesting.

1685
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:14,510
Look at the pattern in the.
In the steel Damascus steel,

1686
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:17,570
if you go to his instagram,
there's a picture of my knife in there.

1687
01:22:17,571 --> 01:22:19,080
You could see it.
He,

1688
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:24,200
this guy is.
I mean that's it right there at the far 

1689
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:24,200
right.
Far those two.

1690
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:24,680
Those are the two knives that he made 
for me.

1691
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:29,690
That's a sexy bit of kit.
Those ancient bog oak.

1692
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,710
That's what it is.
What is it?

1693
01:22:30,711 --> 01:22:33,170
What's the bulk from?
Is that an American bug?

1694
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:34,700
I don't know.
I'd have to ask him.

1695
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,510
I just took his word for it,
but look at that thing.

1696
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:40,190
That's lovely.
That's what I used to cut up.

1697
01:22:40,191 --> 01:22:44,900
Garlic all sold excalibur.
We've made that Domestica scale man.

1698
01:22:44,901 --> 01:22:46,910
Really?
I'm into a band.

1699
01:22:46,911 --> 01:22:49,490
Damascus stuff.
Did you have a blade?

1700
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:51,680
Smith fashioned for your moving?
Uh,

1701
01:22:51,681 --> 01:22:53,090
yeah.
Wow.

1702
01:22:53,091 --> 01:22:55,220
So you had it specifically made for the 
movie?

1703
01:22:55,270 --> 01:23:00,270
Yeah.
Poor old Charlie Hunnam who plays King 

1704
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:00,920
off there is.
It'd be waiting to receive this sword.

1705
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:02,520
How much does it weigh?
I mean,

1706
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:04,460
this motherfucker had to get in shape 
for that thing,

1707
01:23:04,461 --> 01:23:04,970
right?
Yeah,

1708
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:05,760
always in good.
Nick.

1709
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:08,230
You're like,
you ever do those?

1710
01:23:08,231 --> 01:23:09,220
Um,
uh,

1711
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:14,250
like a shield cast with a steel club.
You realize how difficult it is to 

1712
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:16,390
manipulate even a 15 pound club.
Yeah.

1713
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,550
Bit of hard work.
Very hard work.

1714
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:23,640
If those guys like sword fighters must 
have had intense shoulder strength and 

1715
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:24,010
core strength.

1716
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:26,540
Yeah.
But they think these guys are in the UK.

1717
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:31,560
They every now and then they stumbled 
across a body that's a thousand 500 

1718
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,170
years old and they realized the 
deformity in the shoulders,

1719
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:37,690
the right,
whatever you call that.

1720
01:23:37,691 --> 01:23:39,190
When you pull a biobank.
Yeah.

1721
01:23:39,191 --> 01:23:44,191
Um,
and they used to be in English law that 

1722
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:47,200
every Englishman had to practice for 
eight hours a week to pull back above.

1723
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:52,470
So you've go these skeletons that are 
deformed from the enormous strength of 

1724
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:53,080
the soldiers to these on the shelf

1725
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:54,210
deformed.
How so,

1726
01:23:54,211 --> 01:23:55,800
like what,
what is the issue with it?

1727
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:59,150
It was the sheer Yolanda Joe,
you know,

1728
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:01,330
a lot more about this than me,
but the,

1729
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:06,910
they had become deformed through the 
development of the muscle,

1730
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,460
which in some way then changed the bone 
structure.

1731
01:24:10,461 --> 01:24:11,630
Bone structure.
Yeah.

1732
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,430
Wow.
These massive,

1733
01:24:13,431 --> 01:24:15,440
great,
right arms.

1734
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,110
Those,
I don't know if,

1735
01:24:17,111 --> 01:24:17,750
you know,
in the UK,

1736
01:24:17,751 --> 01:24:19,640
you know,
in this country you do this,

1737
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:22,490
the finger is,
is the single finger in the UK.

1738
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:23,270
It's two fingers,

1739
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,310
right?
But why is that?

1740
01:24:24,311 --> 01:24:25,860
It's for bows and arrows,
right.

1741
01:24:25,890 --> 01:24:30,890
Comes from the English wars and the 
French was um,

1742
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:37,910
and the Englishman we're famous for that
long bows and the famous battle of 

1743
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:40,290
agincourt where there was a couple 
hundred of us and it was 10,000

1744
01:24:40,291 --> 01:24:42,780
of them and they're liberal.
They,

1745
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:48,050
uh,
they had crossbows back then and we had 

1746
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:48,050
this long boat along the way was the 
machine.

1747
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:50,640
Yeah.
In the a bow and Arrow world.

1748
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:53,970
And because the Brits,
that's what they did,

1749
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,200
they were a,
as a week,

1750
01:24:55,201 --> 01:25:00,201
every Englishman have to do that,
that they were pretty lethal with these 

1751
01:25:00,201 --> 01:25:00,201
things.
Anyway,

1752
01:25:00,201 --> 01:25:03,441
they annihilated the entire French army.
There was a famous battle of the French 

1753
01:25:03,441 --> 01:25:05,560
have conveniently forgotten.
Um,

1754
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:09,090
so what the French did thereafter,
if they have recorded Englishman,

1755
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:13,140
was they chopped off two of his fingers,
pull back the bow.

1756
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:16,350
So whenever a,
as,

1757
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,430
as history,
then I'm made eloquent,

1758
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:25,730
is that whenever you saw a freshmen used
to waive the two fingers up at him and 

1759
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:30,441
then since then it's now just become 
ubiquitous fuck off sign.

1760
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,620
Have you seen the way the Mongols did 
it?

1761
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:39,280
The Mongols,
they had these incredibly powerful 

1762
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,240
recurve bows and would take 160 pounds 
to pull back and they use their thumb.

1763
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:44,390
They would have a,
a thumb ring made out of bone.

1764
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:45,540
Have you seen that?
No.

1765
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:48,140
I have a bungalow.
They therapy.

1766
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:53,260
There's a fantastic audio documentary on
the history of the Mongols,

1767
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:56,060
the wrath of the con with Dan Carlin and
I listen to that.

1768
01:25:56,061 --> 01:25:57,290
Yeah,
it's amazing.

1769
01:25:57,410 --> 01:25:58,820
Yeah.
I'll even out there.

1770
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:03,821
There's a bit of a fan of yours that he 
keeps me up to date on the different 

1771
01:26:03,821 --> 01:26:04,100
things that you're in because he's

1772
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:09,100
interested in the same things.
I didn't know about the knives and 

1773
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:09,100
there's a couple of other things I 
didn't know that you knew about,

1774
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,670
but he's a big fan.
He got me onto this.

1775
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,590
See those things.
We might,

1776
01:26:11,591 --> 01:26:14,840
I think he got onto this because you've 
got them onto I'm sure,

1777
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:16,660
but once you hear Dan Carlin,
I mean,

1778
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:20,510
it is absolutely addictive,
but this is the ring that they would put

1779
01:26:20,511 --> 01:26:25,010
on their thumb and they would pull back 
like that and then they would wrap their

1780
01:26:25,011 --> 01:26:27,620
index finger over the thing where the,
uh,

1781
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:31,100
the thumb nail is and then pull it back 
that way.

1782
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:36,130
And then release.
That's how they would release their 

1783
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:36,130
arrows.
Well,

1784
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:36,320
it didn't get very far,
did it?

1785
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:41,500
Well,
it did for a long time until gang is 

1786
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:41,500
Kahn died.
I mean,

1787
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,220
they killed 10 percent of the population
they killed.

1788
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:44,060
I mean,
I was kidding.

1789
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Joking around.
They killed so many people that change 

1790
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,840
the carbon footprint of earth.
There was a New York Times article about

1791
01:26:50,841 --> 01:26:53,510
how many people died during gingiss 
Khan's reign.

1792
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:56,780
That it was so significant.
You could see it in the carbon data.

1793
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:58,180
You're kidding.
No,

1794
01:26:58,230 --> 01:26:59,150
no,
I'm not kidding.

1795
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:04,210
See if he could pull that article that 
he killed between 50 and 70 million 

1796
01:27:04,671 --> 01:27:09,671
people during his lifetime were directly
attributed to his army and his 

1797
01:27:10,221 --> 01:27:13,010
decisions.
Fifty to 70 million people died.

1798
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:18,310
The conservative estimate is somewhere 
around 30 to liberal estimate is 

1799
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:18,650
somewhere around 70.
Nobody really knows what they think.

1800
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:23,700
It's between that Mongol invasion in 
1200 altered carbon dioxide levels.

1801
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:28,560
It killed so many fucking people at this
time.

1802
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:31,720
Earth where there was probably only a 
million people kicking around on it.

1803
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:37,030
I don't know how many people there were.
I thought there was a lot more than a 

1804
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:37,400
million because they killed a million 
people in China.

1805
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:43,450
They killed.
They killed people in numbers that we 

1806
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:43,670
can.
Even in Jen,

1807
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:48,700
I think it was Jen China,
they showed up and this was part of the 

1808
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:49,880
Dan Carlin series,
the,

1809
01:27:49,881 --> 01:27:51,430
um,
the show,

1810
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:55,640
the corpsmen and shaw sent a,
like an envoy,

1811
01:27:55,641 --> 01:27:59,330
like a party to go search this,
a city in China.

1812
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:04,480
And as they pulled up,
they thought what they saw in the 

1813
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,870
distance was a snow covered mountain.
As they got closer,

1814
01:28:05,871 --> 01:28:10,871
they realized it was a stack of bones 
and the roads were so deteriorated from 

1815
01:28:11,331 --> 01:28:14,450
human bodies,
just rotting human bodies.

1816
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:19,540
They had abandoned the roads because 
they couldn't get their cars through 

1817
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:22,590
there.
Their wheels rather through because 

1818
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:23,780
their wheels were getting bogged down.
Their horses were getting bogged down in

1819
01:28:23,781 --> 01:28:27,200
the muck of deteriorating bodies as so 
many people.

1820
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:32,201
The Mongols killed.
What the Fuck I was at?

1821
01:28:33,711 --> 01:28:37,730
Just the design for empire.
It's a real good question.

1822
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:40,370
First of all,
is the dehumanization of the enemy.

1823
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:45,720
I mean,
his idea was that everybody who doesn't 

1824
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,651
live in a tent and anybody who doesn't 
live the way they do these fools that 

1825
01:28:47,651 --> 01:28:47,651
live in cities,
they weren't even human.

1826
01:28:47,651 --> 01:28:52,151
There were sheep like.
There was a certain disconnect between 

1827
01:28:52,151 --> 01:28:53,900
them and the other,
which is imperative.

1828
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:58,930
It's the most important thing in war.
You have to decide that that person's 

1829
01:28:58,930 --> 01:28:58,930
not you.
Right?

1830
01:28:58,930 --> 01:29:03,050
You have decided that there the other,
whether it's the Vietnamese or the 

1831
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:03,050
Germans,

1832
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:04,440
the Nazis,
the Japanese like whatever it is,

1833
01:29:04,441 --> 01:29:09,441
you have to decide that they are less 
than you and they had this thing about 

1834
01:29:09,441 --> 01:29:12,120
people that did not live like they did,
that they were pussies,

1835
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:17,600
these,
these weak people that lived in these 

1836
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:17,600
cities with their walls and so they 
would just find,

1837
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:22,790
find these cities.
They'd stroll up and they would just 

1838
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:24,951
figure out a way to start attacking them
and they would light bodies on fire and 

1839
01:29:24,951 --> 01:29:26,820
launched them with catapults onto the 
roofs of these buildings.

1840
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:30,450
But what was the.
What was the motivation?

1841
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,640
It was just conquering.
Just conquering.

1842
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:37,900
I mean,
they just wanted to expand their empire 

1843
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:37,900
and take over.
I mean,

1844
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:38,910
it's not.
There's no noble pursuit and there is no

1845
01:29:38,911 --> 01:29:40,290
religious pursuit either.
I mean,

1846
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:41,920
it's a expansion.
Yeah.

1847
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,380
Will.
They just wanted to own it all.

1848
01:29:43,381 --> 01:29:45,780
They,
they felt like everyone they encountered

1849
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:49,160
was subject to their rule and they had 
to.

1850
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:53,100
They had to establish that sip very,
very intense series.

1851
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:58,160
Now remember,
I remember I caught into about five 

1852
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:58,160
years ago.
I don't remember the bone thing with the

1853
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,060
bone thing in off,
but I've got mountains of bone.

1854
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:00,890
Oh,
nice.

1855
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:02,220
Now.
But uh,

1856
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:05,460
I do remember some of that food.
How things drift.

1857
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:11,590
You'd appreciate this.
This is a legitimate Samurai sword from 

1858
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:12,810
the 15 hundreds.
Really?

1859
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:13,770
Yeah.
That's a real one.

1860
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:16,590
Well,
that's quite sexy time.

1861
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,930
Was this shock skin going on up here?
I don't know.

1862
01:30:18,931 --> 01:30:19,940
I mean,
I think that the,

1863
01:30:19,941 --> 01:30:21,720
uh,
the case is probably a,

1864
01:30:21,721 --> 01:30:24,810
a modern case,
but that blade itself,

1865
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:29,870
that is a,
that is a blade from somewhere around 

1866
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:29,870
1511.
They think.

1867
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:34,220
How'd you get your hands on this?
It was a gift from my business 

1868
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:35,130
associate.
Aubrey Marcus,

1869
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:36,830
a good buddy of mine.
And um,

1870
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:39,420
we're in business at onnit together and 
he gave me this.

1871
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:41,040
That's quite a thing.
Yeah,

1872
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:42,960
it's quite a thing.
That's a real thing.

1873
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:45,360
It's not one of these blades that once 
you take out,

1874
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:46,800
you go to draw blood,
is it?

1875
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:47,370
No,
no,

1876
01:30:47,371 --> 01:30:48,280
no.
Anything.

1877
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,560
We go this a military unit in the UK 
called the workers that come from the 

1878
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:58,161
poll.
That's been a tradition for a couple of 

1879
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:58,161
hundred years and they have these funded
little knives hooks on.

1880
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:58,580
Yeah,
they're weird.

1881
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:03,590
Nice.
We ate the lives and once they draw 

1882
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:05,931
them,
once they're at the sheath that they're 

1883
01:31:05,931 --> 01:31:08,721
not allowed to put them back into this.
Got Blood on him so they have to cut 

1884
01:31:08,721 --> 01:31:08,721
themselves and the Catholic.
Anybody,

1885
01:31:08,721 --> 01:31:13,020
anybody Christ.
I was like a weird excuse to cut 

1886
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:13,130
yourself.
Yeah,

1887
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:16,830
I mean doesn't that.
That's like a pretty rigid requirement.

1888
01:31:16,831 --> 01:31:18,450
Don't draw unless you're going to draw 
blood.

1889
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:20,360
What can I tell you?
I mean,

1890
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:21,900
being a soldier,
tufts stuff,

1891
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,410
it is as tough as it gets.
Yeah.

1892
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:29,600
Now that says something about your film 
I'm sure is you're dealing with a a 

1893
01:31:29,731 --> 01:31:34,731
different time and that life back then,
although always precious.

1894
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:39,780
The finite aspect of life is more 
solidified.

1895
01:31:39,781 --> 01:31:41,370
It's more obvious.
It's more.

1896
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:46,420
It's something that you're dealing with 
on a daily basis as opposed to the way 

1897
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:46,420
we live.
Yeah.

1898
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:47,400
I think there's all sorts of advantages 
to that.

1899
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,410
If you're looking down the barrel of a 
gun,

1900
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:54,950
nothing so busy looking down the barrel 
of a gun and we've managed to distract 

1901
01:31:55,771 --> 01:32:00,190
ourselves by be comfortable

1902
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:05,220
liberal lives that we lead and that the 
price for that is that we don't really 

1903
01:32:05,831 --> 01:32:10,831
accept the full accountancy of life,
so we do give ourselves crutches where 

1904
01:32:10,831 --> 01:32:13,360
you look down the barrel of a gun or 
your crutches and taken away.

1905
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:19,020
So I suppose in different periods of 
time you didn't have to.

1906
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:24,270
You didn't have the indulgence of being 
able to worry about what people thought 

1907
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:28,600
of you because there were more important
things to worry about.

1908
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:29,810
Yeah,
yeah.

1909
01:32:29,811 --> 01:32:32,360
There were more important things to 
worry about than social media.

1910
01:32:32,361 --> 01:32:34,820
You have to worry about arrows.
Swords,

1911
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:36,130
death.
Yeah.

1912
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:36,710
Constant.

1913
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:40,350
The thing is that even come back to the 
Mongols,

1914
01:32:40,770 --> 01:32:45,210
so what was his desire for gain?
His desire for gain with the more people

1915
01:32:45,211 --> 01:32:47,400
appreciate and respect me.
Then the more I'll be,

1916
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:52,470
is there anything else that kills people
other than that motivation?

1917
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,150
Not like that.
Well,

1918
01:32:56,151 --> 01:32:57,860
not even like that.
I'm just doing about murder,

1919
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:02,970
right?
The whole genesis of murder is based on 

1920
01:33:02,970 --> 01:33:04,640
the principle that someone has more 
power than me,

1921
01:33:04,641 --> 01:33:09,641
so I have to take that power away,
or my comparative sense of self feels 

1922
01:33:10,311 --> 01:33:13,730
augmented if I can take that life away.
Hmm.

1923
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:15,050
No.
Comes back to the same thing.

1924
01:33:15,051 --> 01:33:20,051
You're really asking someone to tell you
who you are and if you have 

1925
01:33:20,051 --> 01:33:22,100
paradoxically and ironically if you 
killed them,

1926
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:25,550
that makes you more powerful than them.
Although they can no longer bear witness

1927
01:33:25,551 --> 01:33:30,551
or they did bear witness for a second,
but what does bear witness is the story 

1928
01:33:30,551 --> 01:33:33,260
in your mind that somehow you are now 
more powerful

1929
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:36,980
or just fucking hate them.
You don't want them around anymore,

1930
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:39,290
but why did you hate them?
Because they're threatening.

1931
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:42,890
Yes.
Threatening to some way a threatening in

1932
01:33:42,891 --> 01:33:47,891
some way that somehow they can diminish 
your idea of who you are or you find 

1933
01:33:48,411 --> 01:33:49,760
them repugnant,
their actions,

1934
01:33:49,761 --> 01:33:53,940
repugnant dangers to their society,
something then that's not murder,

1935
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:56,550
then it's just eliminating an enemy.
Right?

1936
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:59,000
Or eliminating a threat.
Yeah.

1937
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:04,690
If you could go back,
I mean I've often thought about this as 

1938
01:34:04,690 --> 01:34:08,291
technology evolves,
like will there be come a point in time 

1939
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:09,020
where you can have a window to a certain
era,

1940
01:34:09,230 --> 01:34:14,230
like we'll,
we'll time machines ever be a thing 

1941
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:17,540
where there's a time where you could 
actually go back and view the past.

1942
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:19,740
Is there a period?
Yeah,

1943
01:34:19,790 --> 01:34:21,350
zero period that you wanted to quite a 
lot

1944
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:26,150
because of google earth on one of those.
I like a good porn on google earth,

1945
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:30,320
so where I live in wheelchair,
the guard house in English,

1946
01:34:30,321 --> 01:34:35,321
countryside next door to stonehenge.
If you go on Google plus where they 

1947
01:34:35,331 --> 01:34:40,331
plowed the fields,
you can see where there had been burial 

1948
01:34:40,331 --> 01:34:41,450
sites for thousands of years.
Alright,

1949
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:46,500
good.
Stonehenge is about five and a half 

1950
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:46,640
thousand years old,
but all around that area,

1951
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:49,190
in these plow fields you can see they've
still got married,

1952
01:34:49,191 --> 01:34:54,191
old bounds and a burial mounds and 
whatnot and the whole earth is littered 

1953
01:34:57,170 --> 01:35:02,170
with prehistorical earthworks and burial
sites and there were burial sites that 

1954
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:07,880
we have this thing called Ordinance 
survey which registers.

1955
01:35:07,881 --> 01:35:08,990
I mean,
but you will have the same thing.

1956
01:35:08,991 --> 01:35:10,630
He was registered is everything on the 
earth,

1957
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:12,830
right,
so everything of any historical value,

1958
01:35:12,831 --> 01:35:17,831
there's a map and they tell you what the
foot paths are and the roads are and 

1959
01:35:17,831 --> 01:35:19,130
everything's been highly detailed,
how high the mountains are and the roads

1960
01:35:19,131 --> 01:35:24,131
and whatnot,
and I'm a bit of an Anorak for that.

1961
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:27,080
You know the expression and right now 
it's like a geek.

1962
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:30,260
Okay.
You know those guys at trains and planes

1963
01:35:30,261 --> 01:35:32,240
and they usually wear those jackets go 
down.

1964
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:34,210
Anorexia is where the Christian 
counseling,

1965
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:38,470
so I'm a bit of an Anorak for 
typography.

1966
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,810
The history of typography,
so you go and Google Earth.

1967
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,840
This was a bit of a wet dream as far as 
I was concerned because I could spend 

1968
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:49,960
hours and hours pouring over landscape 
and around my house.

1969
01:35:51,261 --> 01:35:53,900
You can find these,
all these burial sites that no one knows

1970
01:35:53,901 --> 01:35:55,820
existed and is only as good as google 
earth.

1971
01:35:55,850 --> 01:36:00,850
It's just an arm confident that still 
I'm the only person that knows these 

1972
01:36:00,850 --> 01:36:01,730
burial.
These burial sites exist.

1973
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,770
So how do you know their barriers sites?
Like what are you seeing?

1974
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:08,850
Because you can build up a,
an understanding of pattern recognition.

1975
01:36:09,591 --> 01:36:14,591
Again,
you can see an established burial site 

1976
01:36:14,591 --> 01:36:15,770
which is seen as a prehistorical 
parasite bronze age or whatever it is,

1977
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:21,250
and then you get step a mile to the 
right and then you can find one under a 

1978
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,310
plowed field where they've got rid of 
the mounds,

1979
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:30,460
but you can still see the depressions,
which isn't exactly the same shape as 

1980
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:32,120
the depression's a mile to the right.

1981
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:35,420
And then you can build up a whole 
pattern.

1982
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,780
So this is the area where you get crop 
circles.

1983
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:39,890
Yeah.
So.

1984
01:36:39,891 --> 01:36:44,480
And then you can build up a whole 
picture which is a much bigger picture.

1985
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:49,810
And then you can start to predict where 
one burial site is going to be and it's 

1986
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:52,490
a bit like finding treasure and you go 
to 100 yards that direction,

1987
01:36:52,491 --> 01:36:55,940
$200 and it should be about a bang.
There it is.

1988
01:36:55,941 --> 01:37:00,230
You can see half of these depressions 
and then it runs into a word or whatever

1989
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:05,231
it is.
But this staff that exists and you 

1990
01:37:05,231 --> 01:37:06,080
wouldn't have known before Google Earth 
came along.

1991
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,220
How much work has been done on like 
trying to study those things?

1992
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:11,270
Well,
the thing is on Joel quite a lot,

1993
01:37:11,271 --> 01:37:12,730
but the thing is,
is prehistorical,

1994
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:15,560
so they're really the only thing that is
there is arrowheads,

1995
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:18,140
right?
And burial mounts and every now and then

1996
01:37:18,141 --> 01:37:23,141
they dig one up and then they find a 
boat buried with a lot of gold and that 

1997
01:37:23,141 --> 01:37:24,020
happens every now and then.

1998
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:29,500
Um,
but there isn't much evidence that was 

1999
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:29,930
left behind.
So,

2000
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:34,960
you know,
most of these things are just amount of 

2001
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:34,960
earth with few bones it.
But it's kind of crazy because that's an

2002
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,070
area where people have been living for 
thousands of years.

2003
01:37:37,071 --> 01:37:40,130
It's not like people went away and then 
came back and now you're trying to,

2004
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:45,500
like,
people have consistently lived in that 

2005
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:45,500
area.
Like,

2006
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:45,650
and then the,
you see things like that horse,

2007
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:48,200
that stone horse in the,
in the countryside.

2008
01:37:48,201 --> 01:37:53,201
Yeah.
The course was a big man with a big 

2009
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:55,991
willie to who's made that chalk chalk.
You can look him up.

2010
01:37:56,031 --> 01:38:00,210
He is a man with the big white willie.
Um,

2011
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:05,340
anyone in that area that you have these 
different emblems of what represented 

2012
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:10,230
tribes or whatever.
So we now live in the UK,

2013
01:38:10,231 --> 01:38:15,231
which is the United Kingdom,
but there is a legacy that,

2014
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:17,160
I mean you'll have the same here.

2015
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:22,440
There is a legacy there that you can,
you can trace back step by step for 

2016
01:38:24,091 --> 01:38:26,260
thousands of years and we get,
you know,

2017
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:31,280
get my not around the Romans.
That was a couple of thousand years ago 

2018
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:34,821
and the Romans been kicking around the 
UK a couple of thousand years and then 

2019
01:38:34,821 --> 01:38:36,840
they went and then in came the saxons.
Um,

2020
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:39,720
and then after the saxons than the 
French came in.

2021
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:43,350
And then the French basically took over 
the UK in 10,

2022
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:48,351
66.
And then you have the culture that we 

2023
01:38:48,351 --> 01:38:48,900
have now,
but you can see,

2024
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:53,930
you somehow you forget that it go that 
your culture goes on for thousands of 

2025
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:59,490
years and you accept really what we see 
as history is the last 6,000

2026
01:38:59,491 --> 01:39:00,600
years old,
5,000

2027
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:03,510
years.
But when you can have a connection to it

2028
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:05,910
and it goes back further than that,
it's hard to get.

2029
01:39:05,911 --> 01:39:09,510
You're not around the Romans,
nevermind the bronze age.

2030
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:12,030
Yeah,
and almost what is that?

2031
01:39:12,031 --> 01:39:13,860
There's the guy with the big willie.
Holy Shit.

2032
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:16,380
What an odd.
How old is that?

2033
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:18,330
Then I say I'm old.
It is.

2034
01:39:19,770 --> 01:39:24,770
There's lots of that that goes on around
the guy running that you fully erect 

2035
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:28,890
with a giant club.
How strange and there's a bunch of these

2036
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:33,891
and they do.
They understand the origins of these 

2037
01:39:33,891 --> 01:39:33,891
things and they know where they came 
from.

2038
01:39:33,891 --> 01:39:35,970
I have no is the answer to that.
These are later.

2039
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:40,560
They look quite primitive.
I think these are later.

2040
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:46,430
How strange,
but that whole area is littered in this 

2041
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:49,300
sort of paraphernalia if you will.
Yeah,

2042
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:53,520
and they don't necessarily know who did 
it or why now,

2043
01:39:53,521 --> 01:39:58,521
but what's exciting to someone like me 
is that you aren't going through any 

2044
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:02,370
other conduit and I suppose it's what it
is.

2045
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:07,110
It's the mystery.
It's the mythology of all of this,

2046
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:10,560
but it's your road into it as an 
individual.

2047
01:40:10,710 --> 01:40:12,540
You're not cancer.
Any history books,

2048
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:15,570
you're seeing it and it's like 
discovering treasure.

2049
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:20,550
You can access it on your own,
on Google Earth,

2050
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:23,190
and you're thinking,
is anyone else doing this?

2051
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:28,560
Why would they be doing it?
I started doing it because I wanted to 

2052
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,011
see.
I can't remember some aspects on some 

2053
01:40:31,011 --> 01:40:31,011
poem Atlanta before.
No.

2054
01:40:31,011 --> 01:40:31,011
Oh look,
there's a burial site.

2055
01:40:31,011 --> 01:40:31,770
I'll have a little look.
And then before,

2056
01:40:31,771 --> 01:40:36,771
you know,
breadcrumbs lead to bakeries and you 

2057
01:40:36,771 --> 01:40:37,770
find yourself filling your boots with 
all the pastries in the world.

2058
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:43,460
Um,
and it's something very exciting about 

2059
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:45,951
that.
So in reference to what it was that you 

2060
01:40:45,951 --> 01:40:45,951
said earlier,
if I could go back to any time,

2061
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,970
a lot of cut back for a minute,
I'm not sure I'd go back for for long.

2062
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:56,310
I see that the period that we're living 
in is the most exciting period to live 

2063
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:59,620
on this planet.

2064
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:05,220
And not not least.
So because of what we've been talking 

2065
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:09,781
about stem cells,
is that going to be the thing that 

2066
01:41:09,781 --> 01:41:13,740
allows you and I to age more gracefully 
and without so much pain?

2067
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:20,130
We have enough wealth that we can live a
comfortable life.

2068
01:41:21,101 --> 01:41:26,101
If you decide,
if you choose to live a comfortable 

2069
01:41:26,101 --> 01:41:28,411
life.
We have medicine that we'd never had 

2070
01:41:28,411 --> 01:41:29,920
before this period in history.
It is.

2071
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:33,490
We are still complaining was still 
complaining,

2072
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:38,140
but if we could just remember what we 
are comparatively,

2073
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,290
where the position we are in history 
comparatively.

2074
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:43,330
It's an end to all complaints.

2075
01:41:44,190 --> 01:41:45,720
Yeah,
comparatively for sure.

2076
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:48,060
It's interesting too when you're talking
about this,

2077
01:41:48,090 --> 01:41:53,090
the use of technology and how what you 
can do now with stem cells in 

2078
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:53,470
comparison,
the pesticide,

2079
01:41:53,490 --> 01:41:58,490
because it's really exciting,
emerging time but similar like the use 

2080
01:41:58,490 --> 01:42:01,030
of google earth to discover these mounds
and things and we see what's going on in

2081
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:06,080
the Amazon now they're.
They're discovering evidence of 

2082
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,190
civilizations that were just rumors and 
myths like the gold city,

2083
01:42:08,191 --> 01:42:13,191
the ancient gold city that there's that.
What is that movie that there is a lost 

2084
01:42:13,191 --> 01:42:13,191
city of Z.
Yes.

2085
01:42:13,410 --> 01:42:18,410
They're finding these established 
irrigation paths and city grids in the 

2086
01:42:20,611 --> 01:42:24,180
Amazon jungle.
Thousands and thousands of years old and

2087
01:42:24,181 --> 01:42:27,030
they don't know the origins.
They don't know who was there.

2088
01:42:27,090 --> 01:42:30,240
They don't know why they're constructed,
what the culture was like,

2089
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:35,450
but this was all at one point in time,
just mythological and now they're 

2090
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:36,200
realizing like,
no,

2091
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:36,510
no,
no,

2092
01:42:36,511 --> 01:42:38,220
this is history and this is.

2093
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:43,220
They've been told and passed down and 
these fables and now we understand 

2094
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:46,701
there's an actual.
There's a concrete physical grid rather 

2095
01:42:46,701 --> 01:42:47,010
that you can go and you could see like,
no,

2096
01:42:47,011 --> 01:42:51,300
these are real cities that did exist and
the jungle is sort of engulfed them.

2097
01:42:51,301 --> 01:42:53,430
It's taken over them.
It's amazing,

2098
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:55,650
eh?
It's a thing bulaff oh,

2099
01:42:55,651 --> 01:42:57,270
it's incredible.
I mean it's allowing,

2100
01:42:57,310 --> 01:43:02,310
and this is only step one.
I think Google Earth is going to give 

2101
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:05,391
way to some sort of a magnetic resonance
type thing where they're going to be 

2102
01:43:05,391 --> 01:43:06,960
able to look deep into the ground.
I think what we're seeing now is you're,

2103
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:08,220
you're going to be able to.
You're right.

2104
01:43:08,221 --> 01:43:13,221
Now we're exploring the surface of the 
earth and we're finding all these 

2105
01:43:13,221 --> 01:43:13,230
characteristics that,
oh,

2106
01:43:13,231 --> 01:43:16,740
this is a body or this is a a burial 
area.

2107
01:43:16,741 --> 01:43:19,560
This is a pathway that was probably 
irrigation,

2108
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:24,860
but I think they're going to be able to 
come up with technology that allows you 

2109
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:27,540
to do the same thing but look deep into 
the ground and then I think you're gonna

2110
01:43:27,541 --> 01:43:32,541
be able to find all kinds of crazy shit 
the same way they can understand like 

2111
01:43:32,541 --> 01:43:35,430
the complete topography of the bottom of
the ocean now and if you look at some of

2112
01:43:35,431 --> 01:43:40,431
those maps that show the ocean and 
literally shows the depths at every 

2113
01:43:40,431 --> 01:43:44,001
stage you,
I think you're going to be able to do 

2114
01:43:44,001 --> 01:43:44,001
that deep into the surface of the 
ground.

2115
01:43:44,001 --> 01:43:44,760
They're going to be able to discover all
kinds of crazy stuff.

2116
01:43:44,910 --> 01:43:47,220
Someone keeps opening that door.
What are you saying?

2117
01:43:47,870 --> 01:43:49,980
We got to get going.
This is why I don't allow people to come

2118
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,950
ruined into a perfect God damn 
conversation.

2119
01:43:51,951 --> 01:43:52,100
That's

2120
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,840
all I've.
I know I haven't.

2121
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:56,210
It's great because you biggest fan.
I'm a big fan of him.

2122
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:58,370
You got some other commitments?
I guess so.

2123
01:43:58,730 --> 01:43:59,970
I do.
Yes.

2124
01:44:00,090 --> 01:44:02,690
I'm selling a film and I'll show you.
Go ahead and say it.

2125
01:44:02,691 --> 01:44:03,620
You're like,
fuck yeah.

2126
01:44:03,621 --> 01:44:05,540
I'm going to go see it.
I love all your movies,

2127
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:06,350
man.
I'm a big fan.

2128
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:07,700
I was really excited to have you in 
here.

2129
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:08,720
So,
uh,

2130
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:11,090
when is it out this weekend?
Not this weekend.

2131
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:14,420
Next weekend.
So that is Ivan.

2132
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,210
Do you want to stick your head back in 
and Ivan's.

2133
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:18,740
He's scared now.
You scared him off?

2134
01:44:18,970 --> 01:44:21,350
I,
even if it's not this weekend,

2135
01:44:21,351 --> 01:44:23,690
it's next weekend.
Is that may the twelfth?

2136
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:26,990
It's the weekend after guardians of the 
galaxy is.

2137
01:44:26,991 --> 01:44:28,580
I believe that is may the twelfth.
Right.

2138
01:44:29,870 --> 01:44:31,460
Excited about it.
Yeah.

2139
01:44:31,461 --> 01:44:36,461
I love the film.
I like it was a tough out there that 

2140
01:44:36,461 --> 01:44:36,461
brother.

2141
01:44:36,461 --> 01:44:39,670
I bet it is tough.
You've got a crazy business when you 

2142
01:44:39,670 --> 01:44:39,670
decide.
And I'll just leave you with this.

2143
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,680
When you decide like to commit to an 
idea,

2144
01:44:42,681 --> 01:44:45,280
I'm sure you have a gang of ideas 
bouncing around your head.

2145
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:47,530
Like what makes you just go,
all right,

2146
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:49,010
this is the one.
Let's run with it.

2147
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,220
Telling how changing and it changes by 
the year.

2148
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:55,250
My next movie is Aladdin.
Oh really?

2149
01:44:55,251 --> 01:44:56,600
Yeah,
like the magic lamp.

2150
01:44:56,630 --> 01:44:58,600
That's the one really?
Yeah.

2151
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:01,700
And in no small part,
because you know,

2152
01:45:01,701 --> 01:45:06,701
you get a weekend a right,
so that plays a little bit of a factor 

2153
01:45:06,701 --> 01:45:08,120
in your motivation,
but it has to,

2154
01:45:08,121 --> 01:45:10,670
you don't spend three years on a movie 
and no one hear about it.

2155
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:15,730
Right a lot.
And they'll buy you would be very 

2156
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:15,730
fascinating.
I'll find it.

2157
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:20,290
You know,
I liked the idea of taking the genres 

2158
01:45:20,301 --> 01:45:22,420
that I don't know anything about retail.

2159
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:27,440
Is it kind of excited you like doing 
this King Arthur thing and in this 

2160
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:30,701
fantasy genre,
and this is sort of a changed your 

2161
01:45:30,701 --> 01:45:31,010
expectations for possibly considering 
other.

2162
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:33,390
I sort of did English gangster films 
from that.

2163
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:35,750
And then Sherlock Holmes don't stop 
doing those though.

2164
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:39,480
Gangster films has to be TV.
It could be TV.

2165
01:45:39,550 --> 01:45:41,420
Were lots of that now because that's 
where it's gone.

2166
01:45:41,421 --> 01:45:43,160
That's sort of interesting.
Netflix,

2167
01:45:43,161 --> 01:45:45,050
hbo type stuff,
that sort of stuff.

2168
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:48,020
Um,
and then man from uncle,

2169
01:45:48,021 --> 01:45:50,960
which is like a spy thing,
and then he jumped to the spine genre.

2170
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,400
So let me go.
Oh right,

2171
01:45:52,401 --> 01:45:57,401
okay.
I can go from this to that genre and 

2172
01:45:57,401 --> 01:45:57,930
that's exciting.
And I've got five kids and he got five,

2173
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:00,110
five kids.
Wow.

2174
01:46:01,010 --> 01:46:03,440
Which means I'm familiar with Disney,
right?

2175
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:06,380
Of course.
So yeah,

2176
01:46:06,490 --> 01:46:06,930
all that.
What?

2177
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,900
That world looks very attractive and 
challenging.

2178
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:12,140
Awesome guy,
reggie or bad motherfucker.

2179
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,850
Thank you joe.
I Love Avenue in here.

2180
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,050
Thank you.
It's been a great pleasure.

2181
01:46:15,051 --> 01:46:16,910
I enjoyed it enormously.
I was.

2182
01:46:16,911 --> 01:46:18,710
Do it again next time.
Your sound.

2183
01:46:18,711 --> 01:46:19,670
Something.
Come on in,

2184
01:46:19,671 --> 01:46:20,570
baby.
Thank you.

2185
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:22,340
All right folks.
That's it for the week.

2186
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:23,390
We'll see you soon.
