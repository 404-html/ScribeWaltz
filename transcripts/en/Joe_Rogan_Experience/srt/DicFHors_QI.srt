1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,710
Don't forget to turn your volume off.
Meow.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,940
Is that meow means we're going, yes.
Okay. My, my volume. Totally off.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,670
Everybody settle down.
Settle down.

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,690
There's no way to say the same shit
every goddamn time and not get bored with

5
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:27,960
it. I wish I had something new to say
about the flashlight, but I don't,

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,770
you know what it is. There are
spots. What the fuck is that Brian?

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,970
Oh, that's somebody from sinister props.
Our friend over there send us another,

8
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:35,930
a thing today.

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,900
Wow. That is dope. And that's the same
guy that made the um, exorcist one. Yep.

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,090
Exorcism. This one has a, this
is a Zombie. Hitler. Well,

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,740
Nazis, his Ma's. He's not allowed to sell
it with a mustache for legal reasons.

12
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:54,910
So I have to put something on there
cause he can't sell dummies with the

13
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:57,250
mustache. I, I'm just, I'm
just joking. I don't know.

14
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,930
It's without a mustache.
He could just be a random Nazi dude.

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,870
Some other scary Nazi dude.
Yeah. And then he moves.

16
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:07,090
He does this like creepy thing
when it's hung up. Right.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,650
Where he's just like moves down.

18
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,600
Oh Wow. Like it's kind of weird.
Yeah. And his eyes turn on and off.

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,190
Yeah. That would be the
worst. A Nazi Zombie.

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,910
Like it was a cunt in life. You know,
what is it going to be like in death?

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,980
You know the Nazis easier. The country
is humans have ever lived, right? Yeah.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,070
If someone's being a con, what do you
say to him? What do you a fucking Nazi.

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,280
You say that? Yeah, like that is the
thing that you say when someone's just a,

24
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:36,730
an utter cunt.
And that along with being,

25
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,280
the only thing that can be
worse is if they were gay.

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,550
Rapist zombies, right? Not just gay.

27
00:01:45,551 --> 00:01:47,860
Just gave rapist sons.
There's nothing wrong with being gay.

28
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:52,660
I mean it would probably be your best
quality if you're a Zombie and a Nazi and

29
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:55,870
gay. He'd be like, well gaze. The only
part that, it's not even a problem,

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,060
but if it was a rapist
Zombie and it was gay,

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,110
that would be like the worst.
If it was a Nazi rapists,

32
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,150
like if it fucked you and just said
horrible antisemetic shit. Well,

33
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:14,080
that's why you better obey the first
rule. Zombie land. What is the first rule?

34
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,430
Zombieland cardio. Oh, that's right,
that's right. That movie, you're a fatty.

35
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:21,970
You're going to get hit by one of those
guys first. Yeah. That was a smart movie.

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,320
That was a great, that was a
fun movie. That was our, like,
it's, it's I, I was like,

37
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,970
somebody told me to see and I was like,
come on man,

38
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:31,300
I can't see another Zombie movie. I
can't, I just don't have the interest.

39
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,720
I know whoever I'm watching the beginning
is going to be there at the end.

40
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,020
You know, they might lose a few friends
along the way, blah, blah, blah.

41
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:40,960
I can't watch it. They usually lose a
few of the Douchey ones. Right? Yeah.

42
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,460
Get wiped out. Of course. Yeah.

43
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:45,100
As soon as someone shows any
unfavorable characteristics, you know,

44
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:46,330
there's Zombie Bait.
Yeah.

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,900
But that was a great example of what
is still possible with the Sharia law.

46
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:52,930
No,

47
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,230
I brought the wife to that one and she
normally would never go to see that shit.

48
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:59,620
And she actually at the end, it was like,
that was actually not, not bad. Yeah.

49
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:03,670
That was a good movie. That was fun. You
know, it wasn't a good movie. Abe Lincoln,

50
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:08,020
vampire hunter. Oh Jesus. Hey,
you're saving the money of going,

51
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,600
how dare you?
It was fun for a little while.

52
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,360
It was fun for like the first
hour and then I was like, okay,

53
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,510
it's getting ridiculous, man. What?

54
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:19,620
They started going through history
and fight for alcohol care. Come on.

55
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,550
It's just silly. This is commercials.
We haven't even gotten to the podcast.

56
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,010
Adam score. Gee, I'm really stoned. Yeah,

57
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:31,360
you might be the germ Rogan experience
podcast. As I was saying before,

58
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,940
I got so rudely interrupted
with my own shenanigans. Uh,

59
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,960
w we are brought to you by the fleshlight.
If you go to Joe rogan.net,

60
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,570
click on the link for the fleshlight.
Enter in the code name Brogan.

61
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,730
He will save yourself 15% off the
number one sex toy for men. Oh,

62
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:49,470
people have been asking us, are we
sponsored by alien? Where there was a,

63
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:52,490
like a thread where people were
saying that like, you know,

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,170
you say you only have two sponsors,
but it seems like you have three now.

65
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,740
Alien ware Alienware is not our sponsor.

66
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,460
Alienware hooked us up and, um, the,

67
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,350
our sponsor is sucker punch entertainment.
So the,

68
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,100
um,

69
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,100
the story behind it is I wanted to
switch to Alienware computers because

70
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,430
Alienware computers are,
uh,

71
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,910
they're supporting a lot of MMA fighters
is a lot of guys that are getting

72
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:23,110
sponsored by Alienware.

73
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,190
And I think that's awesome that a huge
company like Dell has the balls to do

74
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:30,240
something like that. And so, uh, I,

75
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,300
I looked for a way to do a
deal with Alienware computers,

76
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,790
but the way we're doing it is I'm
doing a deal through sucker punch

77
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,190
entertainment. So that is
the answer, that question.

78
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,110
And it's primarily to support a
company that supports MMA fighters.

79
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,120
And I think that's a
good thing for all of us.

80
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:54,121
And if it takes me an extra 15
seconds on a podcast to do that,

81
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,140
uh,
I would like to do that.

82
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,350
Cause I think it's one of the coolest
things that we can do as consumers is a

83
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:04,800
support companies that support,
you know, the things that we enjoy,

84
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,220
the things that we like, especially
companies that take a chance on MMA,

85
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,630
which of course is a, a very
big passion of mine. Um,

86
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:15,820
so that's the answer to that question.

87
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,230
We are also sponsored by on
it on it.com if you go there,

88
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,520
you can check out the new kettle bells
that we have in. We just got them.

89
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:28,480
They're fucking awesome. They're the
best cattle. But you can buy these,

90
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:30,550
your kettle bells,
they're the shit. They're,

91
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:33,910
they're really bad ass
and they're heavy as fuck.

92
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,730
So you have to send these
things through the mail.

93
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,680
The whole thing is up very
to find process. I mean, if
you can't imagine you're,

94
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,700
you're sending cannon balls essentially
cast iron cannonballs through the mail.

95
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,530
I mean, so socks for the ups lady. I
mean it's fucking, you get one of those,

96
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:55,300
fill up the ass for that too. Oh
yeah. Yeah. It's brutal. But you know,

97
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,020
they're the best we can. The best we can
sell. At the lowest price we can sell.

98
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,920
And um, there you get them and they
last for the rest of your life.

99
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:07,880
And I swear you don't need anything
else to get a workout. My best workouts,

100
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:11,390
I use a chin up bar and three
kettle bells and that's,

101
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,990
I don't need to do anything else. I can
do everything with these fucking things.

102
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:19,870
And when you, when you do kettle bells
you get like a functional strength that I,

103
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,510
I never felt that I got from regular
lifting for regularly lifting.

104
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:27,830
Like when you isolate things like
isolate triceps and isolate biceps,

105
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,780
a lot of times that can lead to injury,

106
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:33,710
especially bicep tears happens on a lot
of guys who used to do a lot of curls

107
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,510
because you stress out the muscle from
that weightlifting like that, you know,

108
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:43,511
the isolating one particular body part
and it's an unnatural thing to do.

109
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,700
And then when you go in box
and actually use your arms,

110
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:48,680
that's where guys were blowing
out their biceps tendon.

111
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,050
I hadn't done my bicep but
my shoulders of Clayton,

112
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:54,830
the last cause I for awhile when I was
in New York and I had started my career

113
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,290
in modeling,
then went to film school and sexy bitch,

114
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,830
you sexy bitch that dad now, but how
dare you? I did a lot of just you know,

115
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,950
training just to make the physique and
then went back to boxing because I used

116
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:09,800
to box and I was younger. I was like
western Canadian champ when I was younger,

117
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:14,220
but so now my shoulders would click right.
I had to go get prolotherapy. Oh yeah.

118
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,650
Have you heard about that?
I've had that.

119
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,490
I've had that on my wrist for your
great work. Fantastic. Amazing.

120
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,000
Yet that's considered like if you don't,
yeah folks, if you don't know what it is,

121
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,940
well is it considered a hogwash?
Is that what you were saying? Well,

122
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,480
every time I mentioned like my natural
path is a good buddy of mine from high

123
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:32,450
school and I'll mention him
to regular doctors like,

124
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,360
oh my natural pass said this and they
like my real doctor. We'll stop. Right.

125
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,830
And be like, you shouldn't
listen to what they have to say.

126
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,790
Yeah. That is a tricky thing, right?

127
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,880
Like doctors don't want to listen to any
herbal talk. Like you show your herbs,

128
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,640
herbal, whole natural physician or
whatever the fuck you calling yourself.

129
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,280
You know, cause it's too much
of it that it's just fuckery.

130
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,700
That's why a lot of it might
only be legit. There's,

131
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:56,280
there's probably a lot in
herbal medicine that is legit.

132
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,720
This is a lot of fuckery going on
with that too though. No Man, they

133
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,000
natural paths.
What from our sun?

134
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,710
It seems like it should be an
honorable occupation. You know,

135
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:12,360
get people to live their life in a
healthy way and we'll eat healthy vitamins

136
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,070
and take healthy nutrients.
And you know,

137
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,280
that's what my buddy told me is he
said, you know, when you go that way,

138
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,640
you have to come halfway. Right. Half
of it is you living right. Eating right,

139
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:25,620
looking after yourself. But you know, my,
my natural path also does prescriptions,

140
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:28,260
right? So he's not like he's got his,
you know, he's like, when you get an,

141
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,690
when you get sick you need an antibiotic.
Right.

142
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,920
I tried to make it so your body doesn't
get there. Right? Like my mind is smart.

143
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:38,470
Right. Why is it seem
like fuckery? Break it up.

144
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,860
I mean, I, I'm not, I'm trying
so hard to not be judgmental,

145
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,590
but when if someone says
natural path, I'm like, okay,

146
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,980
maybe he's one of the good guys, you
know? I mean it's like anything else,

147
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:53,300
like when you get into astrology or any,
anytime you go down weird street,

148
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,460
there's just too many people
that are shitting in the alleys.

149
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,850
I'm sure a few people down
weird street have a point.

150
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,290
I'm not saying they don't, I'm definitely
not saying they don't, but God damn,

151
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,800
a lot of them seem to, yeah,
you get seems to be crazy. Yeah.

152
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,680
You get the credit and then they
ruin it for all everybody else.

153
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,100
But you had the prolo done. I mean, I had
it done in my shoulder like mine were.

154
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,830
I would just pick up a milk jug out of
the fridge quick and it slipped a little

155
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:17,430
bit.
Right.

156
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,780
For people who don't know
what prolotherapy is, if you
have a ligament problems,

157
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:25,620
a lot of people recommend this
thing called prolotherapy,

158
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,600
which they inject like a glucose solution
directly into your ligaments and your

159
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:35,601
tendons and it actually forces them to
swell and grow and they strengthened by

160
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,820
as much as 30 to 40% you know,

161
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,300
that's pretty sure that's been proven
yet. I mean, and the way that it started,

162
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:44,080
my uh,

163
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,310
my natural father was telling me that
the way that he got into is in the United

164
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,240
States when you'd have to go,

165
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,750
you get approved for insurance to go get
shoulder surgery and they estimated 60

166
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:55,780
grand. They would try to put you on
the prolo first. They're like, well,

167
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:59,530
this is only five grand, so why
don't we try the prolotherapy first?

168
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,100
Then if that doesn't work then we'll
book you in. So you said some of this,

169
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:05,170
some of the, some of
the mistakes, you know,

170
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,860
in the industry can actually turn out to
have positives and other ways where now

171
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:12,160
that stuff, I mean, I'm not saying for
everybody, there's not the way you put it.

172
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:14,260
To me, that made so much sense. He
said, listen at him. He was like,

173
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:17,770
before you go get surgery and they hack
and shop and they take stuff out that

174
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:21,250
you can't get back. Try
my process. He's like,

175
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:25,330
I've had former NHL players and stuff
that have had it done. If had, you know,

176
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:28,990
wicked, wicked results. If mine doesn't
work, then go get your shoulder chop.

177
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,670
Because once it, well,
what exactly was wrong?

178
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,290
What you're to out of these
commercials real quick.

179
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,670
These commercials are fucking gigantic.
Is this still a commercial?

180
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,720
What is it? Is it really a commercial?
Goddammit, it's a fucking show.

181
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,660
And in the show, this is the beginning
part. Okay. And then the beginning part,

182
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:46,840
we do commercials, but sometimes
we talk to, it's okay. It doesn't,

183
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,320
I like to take a serious,
yeah.

184
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,830
Well this would be just the
Internet's mystery. Okay. Uh,

185
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,690
on a.com kettle bells.
They're awesome. Uh, my,

186
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,750
my point before all that was just that
isolated muscle groups is kind of an

187
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:02,770
unnatural thing.
And the,

188
00:11:02,771 --> 00:11:06,340
the natural way to work out with
weights is to use your whole body.

189
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,390
And that's what the benefit of kettle
bells, the exercises allow you to use,

190
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:14,470
like your momentum and explosive energy.
And it's like, it's all like, you know,

191
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:19,270
they're like real power lifting exercises
like cleans and snatches and today's I

192
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,710
snatches. Yes, I did squats and
you know, and, and, and you know,

193
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:24,910
and alternating cleans is,

194
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:28,540
there's so many bad ass Turkish getups
are so many bad ass exercises you can do

195
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:32,120
with kettlebells. And uh, go check them
out there for sale on at.com. Oh, and,

196
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:36,760
and it also get yourself some
Alpha brain or you'll sound stupid.

197
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,370
It's my new approach.

198
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,210
What's Alpha brain offended that you
didn't give me the new Alpha Brain Joe?

199
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:44,440
I thought I did. No, it,

200
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,710
the new one has like a sticker on it
that says now with something else.

201
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,450
And I might not have that yet.

202
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,940
Do you guys have any of that here but
not in an Ami. Tried it and it's like I,

203
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,913
some of my car

204
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,340
Brett tried it, said he loved it. Yeah.
Whereas writing, yeah, he liked it.

205
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:01,040
So it's legit. There's look
that's very controversial. Uh,

206
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,060
I can't talk about this any
other way other than this way.

207
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,100
So even though it sounds very repetitive,
some people,

208
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:10,300
this might be the first podcast they've
ever heard, so please forgive me, but uh,

209
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:15,160
what they are is nutrients that have
been shown to have a positive effect on

210
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,150
the,

211
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:21,150
your brain's ability to
produce neurotransmitters
that your brain's ability to

212
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,880
work in a smooth fashion of those.
You want some gummy bears? No,

213
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,890
those are scary as fuck.
I know what those are.

214
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,200
Those are those dangerous gummy
bears. Careful out Corgi. Yeah.

215
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:33,640
Don't throw those over there.

216
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,120
If you have any questions about
the nutrients or anything,

217
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,620
the research on the nutrients,

218
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,340
if you go to [inaudible] dot com
all the information is up online.

219
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,840
It's all explained in as scientific
a manner as we are capable of doing.

220
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,780

score gies here ladies and gentlemen,

228
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,050
get down to business.

229
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,480
Okay,

230
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,120
well good experience.

231
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:26,300
Train by day. Joe Rogan podcast show

232
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,330
what's going on? People getting mad at me
from my fucking commercials. What? Ben?

233
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:36,270
I liked the way you do your commercials
cause they actually get into the eye

234
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,200
listening to your podcast. I'll, I'll
get lost in your car. I'm like, Oh shit.

235
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:42,000
They're still in a commercial.
They got to bring it back yet.

236
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,490
Not very professional,
but it is what it is folks.

237
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,510
I think it's better way to let
it fucking fly. Who gives a shit?

238
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,220
I think it's a better way of
doing it. Yes, I agree. Hollow.

239
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,040
Adam scored you ladies and gentlemen, my
friend from another country. Yeah. No,

240
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:02,520
I'm not too far. He's from up
north. Are Our cousin to the north.

241
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:06,510
Is that we are we brothers and sisters?
Are we cousins? Cause that's fucked up.

242
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,580
Who lived right next to her?
We can't be brothers and sisters.

243
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,140
I think we gotta be brothers and sisters.

244
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,320
Then you've got to let the Mexicans
into that means hate me. You know what?

245
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:16,800
Honestly, without skins, fuck your sister.
How hard I have to work on my yard.

246
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,890
We were all going to not trying to be,
I mean how rude.

247
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,060
How dare you suggest it.
Mexicans work on Howard's men.

248
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,370
The ones down from my parents in Texas,

249
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:30,150
they do magical job and
they're 40 bucks a week.

250
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:33,780
Like they cut out sod
and replace it like I,

251
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:38,730
you couldn't get someone to do what they
do for 500 bucks. A lot of fucking work,

252
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:40,050
man.
Being a gardener,

253
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,760
God damn think how hard it is to be a
goddamn Gardner that she has brutal.

254
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,280
I digging ditches all day out in La.
Holy Shit Man.

255
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,980
La.
Kind of a crazy place

256
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,690
to live.
If you really stop and think about it.

257
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,200
We got a lot of people here
and there's no fucking water.

258
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,490
We have to steal the water from the
Colorado River and we call it the l.

259
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,510
We would call our thing the La River.
That is the most hilarious river ever.

260
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,400
And it is like the perfect example
of what's wrong with La. It's cement.

261
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,350
The La River literally is a cement
tube and they call it the La River.

262
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,070
Like that is not a fucking river.
You assholes.

263
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,360
That's a fake river.
And you know what?

264
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:24,650
You guys get power from Canada actually
from dams, not far from where I live.

265
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,630
We steal it or do we buy
it? No, we use by miss who?

266
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:32,930
Dangerous weapons in
Canada. Next thing. Who you,

267
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,460
how do you guys make the power through
big hydroelectric dams on in the

268
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:40,520
mountains. Wow. So then you
sell it to the United States.

269
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,800
What parts of the United States?
California is wine,

270
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:46,250
and we brought it up in a union
member like mayor mayor of Vancouver,

271
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:49,070
Larry Campbell. He says,
he's like, I don't think the
trades would stop. He's like,

272
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:53,560
do you want la in the dark and thirsty
because we ship water to right. Wow.

273
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,610
So that's incredible.

274
00:15:55,611 --> 00:16:00,080
So the dams make so much
electricity that you can power La.

275
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,540
Yeah, the world. I don't
think it powers the whole,

276
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,850
I don't even know how they
ship it or how it works,

277
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:08,630
but we sell it to even understand
electricity. Yeah. I under, no, I don't.

278
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,840
I do know that it's,
I don't,

279
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,990
I have no idea how they save in some mind.
Fuck.

280
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:19,970
Our fucking houses are at
every moment electrocuted.

281
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,740
There's fucking cords and if you lik
dumb, your head would explode. All right?

282
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:29,741
It's just shooting the shit that powers
up TVs and air conditioning and you

283
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:32,770
didn't even think about it.
You just plug in your,

284
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:36,650
plug it into the nuttiest fucking
thing you could ever possibly imagine.

285
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,800
There's some sort of an electrical pulse
and electrical field and electrical.

286
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,930
There's a wire and it's connected somehow
down the river to sell fucking nuclear

287
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:48,280
explosion.
Yeah.

288
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,150
It's 12 fucking nuclear power
plant and it's in your house.

289
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:58,151
There's a direct line from that thing
down into some fucking son in the middle

290
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:02,040
of downtown San Diego.
Wherever the fuck that power plan is now,

291
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,670
you always get people thinking deep too.
That's a terrifying thought. Well, that's,

292
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,170
I was trying to think how do they ship it?
Like how do you store it?

293
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:12,440
Do you put it in a can obviously has to
come through a line and then goes into

294
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,780
it. I didn't even understand
it a little tiny bit.

295
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,790
There was a crow in the Starbucks
of the day in line and uh,

296
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:20,670
you know,
um,

297
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,230
I was getting my coffee and she was
talking to her boyfriend and she was like,

298
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,040
what if it was fucking total chaos?

299
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,990
Like if the power never came back on. And
I was like, wow, isn't that incredible?

300
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:37,991
That what we think of is total chaos
is the grid that if we lost this crazy

301
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:42,710
thing that we've constructed,
there's no way we could live without it.

302
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,250
That's a weird fucking combination of
human and machine and technology and

303
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:55,461
relying on at all all the time and just
being terrified of the idea of being

304
00:17:57,421 --> 00:18:01,680
forced to live off the land.
Use tools,

305
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:07,140
catch your food. You know what I'm saying?
You said it is skynet. Isn't that crazy?

306
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:10,530
What a weird thing that we've
become that we haven't even noticed.

307
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,310
It sort of snuck up on us
and we became like a hybrid.

308
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,120
We're like park people and
fucking part technology.

309
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:22,470
We're constantly on the
tit of technology all day.

310
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,260
Paul Day.
Oh Fuck Day.

311
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,740
How do you do with your Joe?
You're pretty good with your Twitter.

312
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:31,310
Getting back to everybody. I mean, I can't
get back to everybody. It's impossible.

313
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,870
I mean, I would get nothing done if I
did, I would like, you know what I mean?

314
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:39,880
I mean, I try to, I get back to
people occasionally, but I don't,

315
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:42,270
I can't commit to doing it to everybody.
It's a system,

316
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,780
but I think you do a pretty
good job. Like, you know,

317
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,420
I'm always able to hit you up there
and you get back to me and you,

318
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,520
I think you do a pretty good job,
man. I mean, I'm looking at mine.

319
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:53,240
I only have like 11,000 followers and
I'm finding it hard to just try to be,

320
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:57,890
it can get pretty nutty one. How?
Dude Luck Justin Timberlake rocks.

321
00:18:57,891 --> 00:19:01,280
It doesn't even have, I think they just
have guys running. Oh, that's so sad.

322
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,870
That's what I don't like.
People like that.

323
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:04,970
That just seems like it's their
generic tweet where they're like,

324
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,760
my show is here. I'm playing
here. Tickets at like,

325
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:11,060
there's none of them just saying, Oh shit.
I just saw the craze. Like you're like,

326
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:14,690
okay, let's just someone running
it on a generic program anymore.

327
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,190
They just give it the handed over to
the publicist. Some people do. Yeah.

328
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,910
That's unfortunate. You know, cause
I like, like Kevin Smith's tweets.

329
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,340
I know Kevin Smith's writing those tweets.
You know what I mean?

330
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,410
Like a Jim Norton. I love Jim Norton's
tweets, so I know he's writing them. No.

331
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:33,550
And that same I, I'd stopped following
the people that I don't think's writing.

332
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,840
And when it's just these great quotes
all the time and stuff like will Smith's

333
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,830
or quotes every day. And I'm like,
okay. I like, that's I think Joel,

334
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,410
I think that's what I was
talking to Brian earlier,

335
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:46,470
like the community you guys built is
because you guys are like interactive way

336
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,480
and you do do it yourself.

337
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:51,230
You're not having a publicists like
checking everything you tweet and saying

338
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,420
shouldn't do this and
shouldn't and doing it for you.

339
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,980
But we should all totally have.
It's really done that.

340
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,350
Brian wants an intervention.
Someone saved me from myself.

341
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,170
Well maybe I missed it, but you haven't
done a tweet. That's so bad. No, look,

342
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:14,730
we're nice people.
I'm fast deleting the,

343
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,510
but the bottom line is if we're nice
people, you gotta be a nice person, man.

344
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,320
It's like, you know,
life can throw you some,

345
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,290
some situations that could go one way
if you choose to be a nice person or

346
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,280
it could go horribly wrong if you
choose to be a Douche bag or choose to,

347
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:34,690
you know, be weird about it
or not be considered about
another person's feelings.

348
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,600
You know, it's real. It's a,

349
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,940
these little like moments where we
like decide who we are. Like it,

350
00:20:39,941 --> 00:20:43,180
it happens and you know,
you can go down the wrong road.

351
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:46,090
It doesn't mean you're a bad person,
you know, like made a mistake.

352
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:49,630
You might have overreacted, you might've
been stressed out about something.

353
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,710
That doesn't mean you still can't be a
good person and he's just got to reset

354
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,790
and realize you're not the past.
Okay. You're not all your fuck ups.

355
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,250
You're what you've learned.
You're now, you're, you're,

356
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:03,220
you're the you now that
gets it some move forward,

357
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,640
move forward and let that shit
go. Well, I have to, you know,

358
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,140
bring it up for the people listening,
Joe.

359
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,230
I mean like how cool you were when
we first came to do the union, right?

360
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:12,220
Todd called you.

361
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,580
We needed someone that we knew we needed
someone that knew the subject matter,

362
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:19,330
that was a celebrity punch. And you know,
three guys from Canada, you said, yeah,

363
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:21,820
no problem. We come to your house. I've
been, it's still, if you were like,

364
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:24,610
what was the first time you met? Joe was
like, we came to the house and he's like,

365
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:27,220
how long has set up the lighting? And
we're like, Oh, 20 minutes. He's like, oh,

366
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:30,160
the kitchen's over there and I'll be
right back. I'm just going on my computer.

367
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,420
Then I was like,
man,

368
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:35,350
we're just three random guys from
Canada and your Todd Todd is a very good

369
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:40,090
friend and uh, you know, he's,
uh, he's done a lot for the whole,

370
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,630
uh, legalization process and the,
Oh, I shouldn't even say that.

371
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,010
I should say the awareness process.
You know,

372
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,390
he's got a great book on how to grow hemp.

373
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,820
He's a brilliant guy when it comes to
the history of it and it's helped him

374
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,920
personally through cancer. So He's,
he's very passionate about it.

375
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,900
So when he brought it up to me, I
was just like, okay, let's do it.

376
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:02,891
It was awesome man.

377
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:07,150
Cause I mean you're the number one asked
for guy to interview for the next one.

378
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:10,180
Like that's how everyone's like Joe, Joe,
Joe, Joe, Joe was like, oh that's cool.

379
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,150
I was like, I'll talk to him. I was like,
they're like you've got to have a muse.

380
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,380
And I mean Joe,
I mean I had to watch the film 1000 times,

381
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:22,000
but when I'd go to sold out theaters and
every time you think like I could count,

382
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:25,450
we knew the spots where
people are laughing like okay
cheeseburger thing coming

383
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:26,890
up here.
Let's Nerf the world.

384
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,950
And I just literally go up some of
my watching cloud, the laugh now.

385
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,550
And they do it every time man. It was
to see that reaction I think. And,

386
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:35,320
and when we did the union,
it came out,

387
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:38,170
I don't think a lot of people
had seen you in that context.

388
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:39,580
They knew as a UFC guy,

389
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,820
not a lot of people need from news
radio unless they were a die hard fan.

390
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,980
And then they need from fear factor.
Right. So they didn't see it. Like,

391
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,850
cause I remember a lot of people are
in like fear factor guy smokes weed.

392
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:51,250
Like they were so shocked when
you said that in the opening part.

393
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:54,430
We have you saying like I realized when
I was 30 years old that I'd be fucking

394
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:59,270
trek. You gotta be fucking kidding
me. Well that's really what it is. Um,

395
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,380
I was just being honest about it,
you know, I didn't think it was, uh,

396
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,460
I, I didn't think doing it was, uh,
anything other than what I had to do.

397
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,420
You know, I think, I think you have to,
when you know something about something,

398
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:14,920
like when you have an experience,

399
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,100
especially in experience about
something that has such a tainted name,

400
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:22,540
like marijuana, you know,
he just like, oh, Meryl Won.
What if, what is he a loser?

401
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:23,430
Just lists,

402
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,440
lists and no spine and no motivation.

403
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:32,410
It's just got this terrible
connotation and connection to it.

404
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,510
And I bought it hook,
line and sinker until I was 30 years old.

405
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:39,580
And, uh, Eddie Bravo got me high. Yeah,

406
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:42,040
I remember what you brought Eddie
over that day. The first time we met.

407
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,350
But I mean I was the same
way when we did the union.

408
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:46,070
I think that's why the union turned out so

409
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,270
good is that we weren't activists or
anything in the beginning. We just,

410
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:51,770
you weren't a pot smoker it on. That's
what I tell people. They're like, oh,

411
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:54,090
what does he like? Is he a stoner? No.

412
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,790
Easy like clean cut and Kirk
Looking Barbie motherfucker.
Martin, what's his name?

413
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:03,410
Ken. Thanks. I'll tell
you. Why am I saying Kirk?

414
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:07,130
Kirk? Kirk, I don't know how you got Kurt
is there's been a black Barbie guy. Yeah.

415
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,550
Should be. What the fuck man?
It has her. They're scared.

416
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,550
So scared.
So scared of a black man has to.

417
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,830
I bet they're probably have. I mean
there's a bar. There must be. He's got a,

418
00:24:22,831 --> 00:24:26,720
Ken must have a friend. I bet he
has a really white features though.

419
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,920
Let's see what his features look like.
Let's see if there's any black men.

420
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:33,020
I think I remember some of
the Black Barbie friends,

421
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:36,180
but I mean there wasn't my
toy by Black Barbie thing.

422
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,420
Must have blackboard that they do and
it's not as, it looks pretty crazy.

423
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,440
How does that work? That's pretty
cool. That's like Tyrese. No.

424
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:49,480
Or Tyson Beckford. Yeah,
that's a handsome black look.

425
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,460
You just got to accept that
that girl meets that guy.

426
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:56,630
He's going to fuck her representative in
doll form of what would really happen.

427
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,310
Yeah.
Look at his body.

428
00:24:58,311 --> 00:25:01,520
He's a super athlete and wonder if
the white has got a body like that.

429
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,690
Put pull up a white Ken.
See if they only came the black eye.

430
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:09,470
A body like that because that would be
hilarious because if that was a human

431
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:13,330
being, I think that one's just a
spoof one that someone may stop. Stop

432
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,080
fucking with you.
That's a title.

433
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,500
That's a Dyson cinnamon. I,

434
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,620
I apologize. I've been trolled. He
got Brian. That was pretty good.

435
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,513
Son of a bitch.

436
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,370
Are Boys supposed to have the Kendall?
Is that what what it is?

437
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,030
Or a girls by the boy? No, boy. I
thought they tried to sell it as that,

438
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:45,580
but I don't think you'd ever think it was.

439
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:47,810
I think I would think I'd
never was four guys at all.

440
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,870
Oh a few dudes wants to bought it and
been like, what the fuck did I do?

441
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,350
I did GI Joe fucking Barbie.
I was going to say,

442
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:57,140
am I the only guy that every time I go
over to my cousin's and there'd be Barbie

443
00:25:57,141 --> 00:25:57,830
and Ken,

444
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,080
I'd strip them down and put them in a
sexual position when I was like seven.

445
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,490
So you only new missionary, right?
It just always be guy on top. But

446
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,710
yeah,
Barbie Ken,

447
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,430
I would buy like like hulk
dolls and shit like that.

448
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,020
Why is that an, because it's 10 it's the
hall you and saw vendors over was event.

449
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,720
If you had a Ken doll, it'd be like
that's how you get into the Barbie party.

450
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,900
Like if all those little girls
are hanging out and partying,

451
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,220
do you want to party with them?
You got to get a Ken doll.

452
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,520
It's like your car and I definitely go
for getting into the little girl party.

453
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,260
I would have tried more of the approach
of just hulk smash his way in there.

454
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,360
And you can't do that when you're 12 man,
that's a,

455
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:44,060
I just don't think I would have
been that slick actually about the

456
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,890
the hook line to get into the place.
That's ridiculous.

457
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:50,560
Cause 12 year old boys are not
playing Barbie. I wouldn't have,

458
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,850
I wouldn't have been that slick. Right.
Like they usually still insult each.

459
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,620
Is that when they like each
other at that age. Yeah,

460
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:58,320
but I'm just saying 12
years old is way too old.

461
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:02,400
Like they gave up on Barbie when I
think kids give up on Barbie real early.

462
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,830
I think we now hold,
especially now with technology.

463
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,640
I mean so any boy who buys a Barbie
doll is probably just being tricked.

464
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,460
If he buys a Ken doll,
he's been tricked by my thing.

465
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:14,550
He's only been tracked because marketers
have gotten, that's what it is.

466
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,400
I mean I collected Gi
Joes, masters, all those.

467
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,320
I had all the marvel superheroes.
I had all of them too.

468
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,330
I was a big Wolverine Junkie.

469
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:29,430
I had his first 50 comics and men are
dorks somewhere along the line though.

470
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,170
You feel real guilty about that?

471
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,580
Like I got rid of my comic book collection
when I was poor and I needed money.

472
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:39,300
I sold my entire comic book collection.
It was just one of those desperation.

473
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:43,950
I need food moves and uh, I, I've,
there was a part of me that was like,

474
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:47,370
this is good because you
really have to grow up. Like,

475
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:49,560
what are you doing reading comic books?

476
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:52,380
You're in your twenties now and you
have to, you know, you're, you're,

477
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,310
you're struggling out here.

478
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:57,660
You can barely feed yourself your
role in nickels to eat, you know,

479
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:01,560
like finding change in your house, get
the, get rid of the comic book pitch.

480
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,080
Then once I got rid of him, like, man,

481
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,850
did you guys ever experimented with
a visionaries? Excuse me, this toy,

482
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,180
it was like right after Gi Joe and they,
they were like a beefier Gi Joe,

483
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:13,890
but they had like holograms all over him,

484
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,660
like a hologram up a
wolf and it looked like

485
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,120
I only went once they stopped and Gi Joes,
I was pissed.

486
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,540
I was about when I grew out of it and it
was just video games after that and in

487
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,100
sports,

488
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,210
I was a huge comic book fan for a long
time when I wanted to be a comic book

489
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:34,720
illustrator at one point. So I was
always like, yeah, yeah, yeah I could.

490
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,700
I used to draw a real
good when I was young. Um,

491
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,980
but I had a really douchey high school
art teacher that kind of turned me off.

492
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,060
He was like, he kept emphasizing
that yet, well you're,

493
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,650
you're gonna if you want
to be an illustrator,

494
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:48,960
you're going to have to draw things.
You don't want to draw. Okay,

495
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:52,140
you're going to have to draw diaper ads.
And he's like,

496
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:54,900
diaper ads was like the one thing
that he kept bringing it up.

497
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:58,740
Like you're a professional artists. You,
he might have to work and do a diaper,

498
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:02,640
add a, I was like, this guy is just
so negative. Like fuck artists,

499
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,080
you know, it was just, he was
a really, really dour dude.

500
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,930
It sucks when you had those
kinds of teachers in high school,

501
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:13,560
whether it's art class or whatever that
you look back now and realize how they

502
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:16,020
really shouldn't have been there
and didn't put in the time.

503
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,440
And then he was gross man.
Like even if you drew like what?

504
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,620
Like your interpretation of something,

505
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:25,950
like a weird sort of interpretation
of something. He would be like,

506
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:29,880
if they want you to draw
something for an advertisement,

507
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:34,620
you draw what they ask you to draw. I'm
like, dude, you're gross. This is gross.

508
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,791
You're like,
you're,

509
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:40,380
you're putting this weird fucking
spin on what is and isn't cool to dry.

510
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:41,920
I like comic bitch

511
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,490
and they're telling me there's
something wrong with that. Look,

512
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,380
she hadn't looked at comic industry like,
Oh,

513
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,910
they're all transferring video
game industry, which is huge.

514
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:53,830
So those people that were telling them
not to do that silly bitches stupid.

515
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:54,664
But then you get that,

516
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,760
you get that like one good teacher that
actually takes a little bit of time and

517
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:59,260
gives you an, you're like, whoa.

518
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:02,320
Like I can learn so much when I
just get that little bit of respect.

519
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,390
I remember I had an English
teacher and it wasn't,

520
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:07,690
it was in like the 10th grade and I
didn't know how to write essays properly

521
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:11,380
because I didn't pay attention to my other
classes and instead of just giving me

522
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:14,240
c minus or d, She came up to me
after class. She's like, Adam's,

523
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,660
anyone ever told you that you
write like your opening statement?

524
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:20,200
Then your argument of like how to do
it. And I was like, no. And she's like,

525
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:24,580
oh my God. Right. She's like,
okay, well I'll help you
with that. And then I'd like,

526
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,470
but I thought that was so simple.

527
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:29,170
That was the first teacher just asked
like instead of just give me a flunking

528
00:30:29,171 --> 00:30:33,370
grades and be like, do you know how
to do this? Yeah. I had a really,

529
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,380
really cool English teacher though.

530
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,740
Everybody tried to get into her
class when they got in their class,

531
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:41,980
they was psyched because she was
really generous with the grades,

532
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:47,080
but she was just the sweetest,
nicest lady. And when you
would go into her class,

533
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:50,650
it would be a completely different
vibe than all the other classes.

534
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,850
Everybody was happy.

535
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:54,760
They were all relaxed because
there was no like authoritarian.

536
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:58,210
But she was such a nice person. He would
never want to get her upset with you.

537
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,230
Like if if she like had to quiet you
down because you were talking in the back

538
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:02,530
of the room.

539
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,280
Somebody that you would feel genuinely
bad like you know you'd apologize because

540
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,720
she was a sweet, sweet person.
She was so inspirational.

541
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:14,800
There's One lady teacher and I had
one Spanish teacher that was a bad

542
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:19,630
motherfucker as well but right. He
was like he, he wasn't letting it.

543
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,750
I think he was a fairly young guy and
he was handsome and like the girls were

544
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,850
like all over him man.

545
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And the dude like I know we had a dodge
like a lot of 17 year old girls cause

546
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,380
cause he was a really handsome guy.

547
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:40,070
I don't think he was any older than
like 23 or 24 it was a scary situation.

548
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,510
Interesting man.
Because he was not much older than us.

549
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:47,350
I remember that feeling like he was so
much closer to us than all these other

550
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:47,650
teachers.

551
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,190
Like the math teacher was like in her
fifties and if this guy was still alive,

552
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,190
I'm still pulses.
All the rest of their dead dude.

553
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:57,880
There were some dead people teaching
high school. Man. I know we had some,

554
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:02,440
I mean I wasn't, I wasn't the greatest
in high school. Uh, it's just, it's hard.

555
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:06,550
It's doesn't pay well that their kids
aren't behaved. The kids are like me.

556
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:09,830
I wasn't, I wasn't not behaved.
I was an idiot. Oh, I was too.

557
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:13,720
And I mean I used to get in fights all
the time because I was insecure and so I

558
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:15,010
was always getting in trouble for that.

559
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:17,530
But I'll tell you that
like teachers would,

560
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,620
they told me later on is that they used
to hear so many bad things about me in

561
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:23,020
the staff room that they were
terrified to have me in their class.

562
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,740
But the teachers that were cool,
like I never ever, like you said,

563
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:29,170
like if I had a teacher that showed
me respect from the beginning,

564
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,040
like if she asked me, I would feel guilty
like you said. Or he like, I be like, oh,

565
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:36,520
I let them down because this guy like
treats me like he's really teaching me and

566
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:40,250
he treats me as an adult. Right.
And is trying to get to instead

567
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,640
of like you said, like coming in like
a dictator and slashing you down.

568
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:47,560
Like a never responded well
with those teachers, you know,

569
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,190
I don't like anybody that to Douche bag.

570
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,680
I don't want to be them when I grow
up, you know? That's how I would feel.

571
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,240
I would be in their class.
I'd be like, shut down, boom.

572
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,630
It's not paying attention. Barely
squeaked through. That was my strategy for

573
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,030
mine too. I barely, it was
funny cause one of the teachers,

574
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:11,030
my buddy works at a bank and they're
getting a loan and she brought up,

575
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,650
she's like,
where's that Adam's Gorgie kid?

576
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:17,270
Is he in jail or is he with the bikers
now? And then my buddies like, no,

577
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:20,990
actually he's uh, going to be on TV this
week. And he's in and they're like, what?

578
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:23,180
And even her husband grabbed her.
It's kind of like, yeah, he's,

579
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:25,580
he's doing well and she's so people
thought you were going to grow up to be a

580
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:29,330
psycho? Yeah, cause I mean, I grew
up in a different, like, I mean my,

581
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,840
my dad owned a strip club when I was
going through high school and just after

582
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:35,960
high school, while I was up
nightclub first and a strip club.

583
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:41,040
And then that was the madness that I
inherited when he passed away in 2003

584
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:45,800
Jesus, that's when we did. Yeah. So, and
I had been away. And how old were you?

585
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,690
I was 23 Jesus Christ.

586
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:52,010
And you have to take over this crazy
strip club in Vancouver. Is that where no.

587
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,380
Colona Colona. Yeah. And it was,

588
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,480
I mean that was biker gangs
rolling through there and shit. Oh,

589
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,960
well you see most of the agencies that
send the girls and BC are owned by EMC

590
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:07,670
clubs. Holy Shit. Right. So
my dad had worked in, yeah,

591
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,590
when I took over it was,

592
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,970
we've been trying to put
together a screenplay for
years. It was, it was, you know,

593
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:16,760
23 years old. I'm thrown into this. I
was living in New York for four years,

594
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:21,260
came back, hadn't been in that environment
forever. What is that environment like?

595
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:24,700
Like it's Vancouver just have a lot of
motorcycle gangs. Is that like a real,

596
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,170
they're the number one. There's an article
in the Mcclain's at the Ha were it,

597
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,500
it was his rich and powerful and BC some
of the richest out of they. There's not,

598
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,840
they don't have as many rivals.
It's smaller.

599
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,720
I mean there's more people in the state
of California then the entire country of

600
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:41,030
Canada. Right. It's just smaller.

601
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:45,320
So there's less competition and
they are the number one. Wow.

602
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,640
So that's like the organized
sort of situation up there.

603
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,940
How dangerous is it?
Well,

604
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,100
I mean I know some of them like you know
that I went growing up through the bar

605
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:58,720
that I knew that are great and you
know, I'm friends with them. I,

606
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,790
I said is it accepted part of
the culture of super accepted.

607
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,540
Like actually when you look at them as
a young guy and you're like, oh my God.

608
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:06,830
Like when they say crime doesn't pay,

609
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:10,850
and you see these guys that are well
built in shape, beautiful girlfriends,

610
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:15,710
they have $60,000 Harley, $6,000 boats.
They're in their 20s and you're like,

611
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:19,280
damn right. Like they're the Rock
Stars of Colona. Like when you,

612
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:22,370
when you go to my hometown, it's
like, that's, that's the guys,

613
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,190
I mean like they'll have a
boatload of beautiful women.

614
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:29,190
And is it possible to get in trouble for
talking about this? Like if you, you're,

615
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:34,040
you're talking about that, you know,
that's why I said the actual name. Yeah.

616
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,350
Yeah. He can't say to
you guys, it's like a,

617
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:41,540
it's like when Vegas ran the mob.
Yeah. Or was it rather the, uh,

618
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:45,360
the mob Ran Vegas? Yeah. I mean,
they're big part of, I mean there's,

619
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:49,770
there in Colona where I live, there's
150,000 people and there's three MC clubs.

620
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,230
Now.
Do they have like shootouts and shit?

621
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,590
Are they genuinely get
along or all wheeze?

622
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,990
Just bcs had a lot of shootings in general
with the drug trade coming up right

623
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:01,290
now. There's been, she's
been all couldn't be avoided.

624
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,330
You saw that?
Uh,

625
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:05,850
I mean I think it made national news
where there was that shooting downtown

626
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:10,560
Vancouver and the hotel and there was
like a women's national soccer team

627
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:13,590
staying amps. It was broad daylight
raid in the restaurant, five star,

628
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:18,070
four star hotel rate in the lobby,
man makeovers getting back.

629
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,780
Is it about,
of course it's all the drug trade hits.

630
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:24,930
They put a hit on somebody or something.
Something to do with that. Yeah.

631
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,390
It was so scary,
man.

632
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,830
That's a scary culture to be criss
crossing with, you know, and,

633
00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:33,480
and your d and then you put booze in
that mix and you're running and you're

634
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:38,000
dealing with this ticking
time bomb. Right. That's just,
it, it, it was a real task.

635
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,500
I mean, my, my wife and with now,

636
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:43,330
I mean she's stuck there with me
and helped me through, you know,

637
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,210
all of those headaches when we
were going through the place. And,

638
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,850
I mean all this happened,
like I had a bat,

639
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:50,130
I did a bad deal with a
childhood friend on the club,

640
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:55,650
so I didn't get paid 23 and all of a
sudden you've taken over this crazy little

641
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,280
situation, sharks just everywhere.
Right. And even some that don't,

642
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,870
they don't realize they're
going to be a shark.

643
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:04,590
Some friends that because of the club
and what that kind of brought for them,

644
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:07,710
they were like, Oh Adam, you should
never sell. It's your dad's legacy.

645
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:08,580
And you know,

646
00:37:08,581 --> 00:37:11,470
cause I want to just go back to New York
and continue with my film career. Right?

647
00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:15,060
Like I wanted, I had already was starting
to do well there and I wanted nothing.

648
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,630
And then I'd be like, oh it's tell him.
Then I get convinced to stay, keep it.

649
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:20,160
Cause my dad left it,
but,

650
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,020
and so the end of the day I didn't get
half of what I was supposed to get out of

651
00:37:25,021 --> 00:37:27,240
it.
And I was shooting the union.

652
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:29,220
I was planning on using
the rest of that to finish.

653
00:37:29,221 --> 00:37:33,330
So I had to go back to my stepfather
like two or three more times to get the

654
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:37,080
financing we needed to finish and
it was, you know, my first film.

655
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:40,110
So people are starting to think I'm kind
of crazy like they astronaut farmer,

656
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:42,420
right? Like you've been working on
this film for a year and a half.

657
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:46,380
You've sunk everything into it.
You sold your house to make this film.

658
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:51,060
Like it was a really well done movie.
You did a really good job of editing it.

659
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,200
It was very entertaining.

660
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,400
It's like I've seen a bunch of cannabis
documentaries and I think yours is the

661
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:58,140
best. I really do. It's,

662
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,480
it's a really well done piece and show
you showed so many points and so many

663
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:07,950
sides of it that are just irrefutable
and it's all just laid out there and

664
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:11,310
people can choose to make
their own decisions of what
they should and shouldn't

665
00:38:11,311 --> 00:38:15,210
do with their body. But if you think
that that cannabis should be illegal,

666
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:19,040
you're insane. You're compliance.
How bout, how bout that?

667
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:22,350
Like the film was done so
well in parliaments eyes.

668
00:38:22,351 --> 00:38:26,100
I just got invited to Parliament Hill
and Canada. That's Canada's White House.

669
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:27,930
For those who out there,
don't know.

670
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:33,140
I got invited by the Liberals to help
show the other mps the pros and cons of

671
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:36,630
cannabis prohibition with the,
they heard in the war, the,

672
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:40,390
the way it happened is Aaron Kotler,
who is the former to Irwin Cotler,

673
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:42,910
former attorney general of
Canada under John Crutches.

674
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,420
He had originally looked
to put a decriminalization
bill in when crutching was

675
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:50,890
ending his term. Um, but then it didn't
go through and his son are in color.

676
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:53,410
Son was actually like really
pissed off and it was like, man,

677
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:56,380
I can't believe you do that. It gets kids
addicted. What are you thinking about?

678
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,640
So then when it came up recently that
they're now the liberals and Canada,

679
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:03,940
we're looking at putting what they call
the most comprehensive legalization bill

680
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:07,360
that's been tried to be
passed in Canada. They, his,

681
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,450
his dad mentioned this in an interview
in a son called in and was like that,

682
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,450
you know, and he's like, hey,
why'd you say that? I was so
against it. And he's like,

683
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,280
well, that's what you told
me last time. He's like, no,

684
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,200
I watched this movie called the Union.

685
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:20,320
I've totally changed my perspective
and I want you and mum to see it.

686
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,940
So these nps kept hearing about it and
they kept getting letters from people

687
00:39:24,941 --> 00:39:27,340
saying like from this and you
should watch it, you said.

688
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,970
So they sent me an email and
say, hey, can you come out?

689
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:33,690
I thought it was getting punked at first.
Like,

690
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,900
so think about the top of my head been,

691
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,630
could you see that happening
here in the u s Oh,

692
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:42,460
the White House would like to this,
this fucking corrupt cunt farm.

693
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,630
Well that's like,

694
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,970
there's pictures of me and Brett and
we're both just standing there going like

695
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,750
really? Like you really invited us
here. That's incredible. Yeah, it's,

696
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,750
what was it like? We're in
this all oh, dress like, oh,
I put on a suit. I want to,

697
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,790
you know, I went to go be professional and
brightness, full business attire, suit.

698
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,760
I've got some pictures, uh, Brian
if you want to pull them up.

699
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,320
But it's like me sitting with the em,

700
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,710
they did a cool way of doing a screening
is they had a square table and they had

701
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,920
TVs on the inside. They were like this.
So no matter what side you sat on,

702
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:12,490
you could see them. And then on the
tables there's also the big screen.

703
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:15,040
So everybody's sitting there with their
mix and they can all look like they're

704
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:17,320
sitting in the thing looking forward.

705
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:22,090
And then what about the Bolo tie? That
shit's ridiculous. Which one's a Bolo.

706
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,170
Bolo tie. That little string tie
that oh no, no, not for a while.

707
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,910
They tried to remember that the Polo,

708
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,130
they tried to try to pass it off as
a tie though. Yeah, it's a bolo tie.

709
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:35,920
Like you can even sneak it in a lot of
restaurants that you're supposed to have

710
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:37,250
a tie on with a Bolo.

711
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,170
Brett Brett got nailed at the Parliament
Hill restaurant cause we went to go

712
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:44,680
there and he just wears a dress shirt
and like dress pants. But they're like,

713
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,850
oh no tie.

714
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,980
So they had this drawer and I swear they
got the ugliest highs ever made just to

715
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:55,540
be like, don't you ever forget your tie
when you come in here. They were hideous,

716
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,360
silly.
Come on.

717
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,440
How silly is it to say to
someone you're not done.

718
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:06,280
You don't have your full outfit on.
You don't have your full outfit.

719
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,350
You have a shirt, you have a jacket.
No, he didn't have the jacket. No,

720
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:13,990
he just had the dress shirt and like
just a dress shirt and dress pants.

721
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:18,400
I came in the full suits.
Not Enough. That's not enough
to have this extra thing,

722
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,930
this extra piece of cloth.

723
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:24,580
So I know that you're a gentleman
because only a gentleman wears his extra

724
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,040
formal piece of cloth.
Man,

725
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,460
I don't expect you with your tie clip
to be calling anybody a cunt or telling

726
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:32,890
people to go fuck themselves.
You know what I'm saying?

727
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,130
That's when they know they can trust

728
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,340
you.

729
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,800
There's a lot of stuff when you go in
there and you're looking at like the old

730
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:38,900
chairs that they sit in where the queen,

731
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:41,990
if she comes in and he kind of
look at all this and like really?

732
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,370
Does that matter? Like, well,

733
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:46,100
what about in the olden days
when they wore those crazy wigs?

734
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:51,770
I think in Canada things,
powdered wigs.

735
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,430
What was that about? Like when they
were in court and shit, they were crazy.

736
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:59,440
Wigs sexy.
When you really think of that,

737
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:02,090
it's like how much it
must've sucked dick to live.

738
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:06,080
Back then it might've been cool to
have wigs on fuck outta here to live.

739
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:11,081
It's hot ass holes with wigs on are
deciding your future and fucking knock and

740
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:12,350
sticks on the ground.

741
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:18,980
Everyone would look so weird
and mysterious. He die of
the flu. How about that?

742
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:22,100
Yeah, but is log out much better
now? Like maybe there's not the show,

743
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:26,360
but I mean it's a game when you get home
and certainly a game lost confusing man.

744
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:30,350
It's like God, who is this benefiting
the half? So God damn many of them.

745
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:35,090
Even lawyers. I mean folks, let's
just, we need balance. We need balance.

746
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:38,600
We can't, it can't have people
just struggling to try to soupy.

747
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:40,600
But we needed some balance in this.
Well that,

748
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:43,490
that was the other thing is after I had
dealt with all this shit with my dad's

749
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:44,510
club and took over,

750
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:48,240
then my half sister sued me for the estate
because my dad had left. Everything's,

751
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:52,490
when shit gets crafty. I couldn't even
believe, you know, go on that end.

752
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:54,410
Like we hadn't talked in years and I had,
you know,

753
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:57,230
really reached out and I bought her a
car and done things to try like, oh,

754
00:42:57,231 --> 00:43:01,310
you know, maybe out of this tragedy we
can build a relationship. And all, man,

755
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:05,600
it just went 40 wanted people were,
you know,

756
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:09,320
people look at other people sometimes like
a lottery, you know, just, they don't,

757
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,050
they don't think they're ever going
to be able to make money on their own.

758
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,830
And this is a certain amount of people
and they have this sort of like,

759
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:21,020
it's almost like a victim's rights
mentality that life is a fuck them so hard

760
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,620
that though they're going to, they're
going to go after you Ken. Man, I felt,

761
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,530
oh I felt that in the,
in the,

762
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,990
in the club scene he just put out a lot
thought into your health and breaks,

763
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,800
know very specific things. Is that what
you felt like? Well how a sumptuous of me,

764
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:41,060
sorry. No, no, because when,
when I had the club, there's
a lot of people, you know,

765
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,490
when I was running it that felt that,
well if you could fuck the customer,

766
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:46,070
good for us, right. We're making
money and I'm just like, man,

767
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,230
that's a bad Karma situation,
man. You can, you can.

768
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,490
I've met people that are real nice people.
Like how about Bob,

769
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:55,580
the owner of the Ice House.
Perfect example, right? Super Nice,

770
00:43:55,610 --> 00:44:00,560
Super Nice person owns this club. It's
so he's putting out good Karma, you know,

771
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,850
real nice to people. Always very
friendly, very generous guy.

772
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,170
Just a cool guy. So in and
out of that comes, comes good.

773
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,880
You know, you control your environment,
you know totally what that was when,

774
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,920
you know, when my dad ran the club, it
did well because my dad was the owner.

775
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,010
There'd be out there shaking everybody's
hand and he was like, he had resentment.

776
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,690
No,
there's an energy you don't over.

777
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,430
Well here's what is there is a ton of
cocaine being sold all through my place.

778
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,070
So when I took over,
you know I

779
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,850
eyes had been, you know, people are
turning a blind eye for awhile. I did.

780
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,420
I look like the King Pin. Right.
Everybody's working their move in and hey,

781
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:41,430
I know people did what they
have to do to do in the club.

782
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:46,230
So I said that stops in the club and
then all my staff, all my staff laughs.

783
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,880
Oh Shit. Cocaine operation.
No it, yeah. Wow.

784
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:53,970
I heard it from, I mean you inherited
a cocaine operation. Oh yeah.

785
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:58,971
I inherited a mess dated 2123
and I was producing the union.

786
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:03,240
My first film, like that was my
only chance to get out of the hole.

787
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,650
How old were you when I'm at IU?

788
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:10,220
I was 24 or 25 25 well for Todd to
have that much faith in you guys,

789
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:16,420
it showed, it showed, well it
showed, you know once I met you,

790
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:21,210
but it certainly showed with your final
work where, where his head was at.

791
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,680
Cause it's, it's really good man. It's
very, very entertaining. No moves.

792
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,120
Well well if we,

793
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:30,180
I always said if people could
see the story of what it
took to put that together,

794
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:34,320
that would be a more entertaining
doc. Nah, maybe just to you

795
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,770
making, if you're fucking movie cause be
as entertaining as the reason why pot is

796
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:44,010
illegal. No way dude. Get serious.

797
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,730
It might be to you. Well
No. Well that's why we're,

798
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,110
it might be like a wedding video.

799
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:51,180
It's something that's awesome
to you but nobody else wants.

800
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:56,460
It's definitely not man. It's, it's,
it's an honor to see the impact it's had.

801
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:57,260
Like it,

802
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,710
I mean my Stepdad was the one that lent
me the money to do it and for me it was

803
00:46:01,711 --> 00:46:02,131
really cool.

804
00:46:02,131 --> 00:46:05,310
One day we were down at pf Chang's in
Houston and we were eating and I had my

805
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,850
union shirt on in this though. The
waiter comes over and he's like, man,

806
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,090
that movie is fucking awesome.
He's like, I Netflix that.

807
00:46:12,091 --> 00:46:13,350
I got 10 friends coming over,

808
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:15,990
I'm going to show it to all them
like and I was like, oh cool, thanks.

809
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:19,290
And cause I had my hat and glass and he
was like thanks. Then he's like, wait,

810
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:20,550
he's, he get a fucking guy. That's it.

811
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,280
Like you do wasn't swearing
but he's like you're the guy.

812
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:24,780
Oh so he thought he was
just saying it was cool.

813
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:28,050
Yeah cause he saw the logo right
on my shirt and then you know,

814
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,440
I'd had that before and it was
really, it's always flattering. I,

815
00:46:30,441 --> 00:46:33,030
I can't believe anybody, you
know, knows my work that well.

816
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:36,990
But then for my dad to see, right. Cause
he took this huge gamble on us. Right.

817
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:40,200
Give us $200,000 cap. My
God, he did. Holy Shit.

818
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:44,580
Brought 200 grand from your
dad to go shoot it. Whew.

819
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:46,500
That's some pressure son on.

820
00:46:46,501 --> 00:46:49,890
I had to go back two or three
times because when I got
screwed over at the club,

821
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,320
I was anticipating to have money
from that that I didn't get.

822
00:46:52,321 --> 00:46:55,440
And now the film was the
only thing I could use to pay
back. Like I'm like, well,

823
00:46:55,441 --> 00:46:57,630
if I'm ever going to pay him back,
I have to get the film finished.

824
00:46:57,631 --> 00:46:59,130
Otherwise I'll never get out of it.

825
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,630
So I had to keep going back and
back and only now, recently.

826
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:05,160
That's why it's funny some people,
but that's really,

827
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:06,840
how much have you made off the union?
I was like,

828
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:10,920
I still owe my family some money.
Do you really? Yeah. Wow. That's,

829
00:47:10,921 --> 00:47:14,310
so that movie's still hasn't
gotten to the black. Well it did.

830
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,150
The distributors made money.
Right. But you know, they,

831
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,030
there's the marketing shipping and
then it's at the end of the day,

832
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:23,430
we have not seen any,

833
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:26,700
like I've been able to pay off my dad
a majority of his stuff. Thank God.

834
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,010
Right in. There's still residual
checks coming. They're pretty small,

835
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,180
but it's, it didn't make like, it didn't
do millions of dollars or you know,

836
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,370
these numbers that some
people might think,

837
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,690
I think a lot of people might have stole
your shit online if we got a quarter

838
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:44,170
for every like pirate bay and stuff
we did in the green. Yeah. You know,

839
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:46,390
it's funny because people
go, yeah, well you know,

840
00:47:46,391 --> 00:47:49,660
he's not losing any money because
I wasn't going to download.

841
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:52,780
I mean I wasn't going to buy it anyway,
so I would have never bought it.

842
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,660
So it's not like he's losing any money,
but it was okay.

843
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:02,320
I know it's, it's, it's
tricky. It's tricky. But then
at the same time, you know,

844
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:04,750
a lot of people did see
it because that the viral,

845
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:08,170
like Facebook and social media is the
main, cause we had no money for marketing.

846
00:48:08,171 --> 00:48:11,290
Yes.
That's what made it go 100% super viral.

847
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:14,550
So for a first film that was,
you know,

848
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,140
it to get the exposure is great
and we weren't that, you know,

849
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:20,350
as long as we could pay our families off
where we're happy with seeing a bunch

850
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:22,510
of memes from that documentary.

851
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:26,500
Oh now like those Internet memes where
he quotes somebody and there's a photo of

852
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:26,800
them.

853
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,650
Oh there's tons and there's tons of where
they've just cut your clips where it's

854
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:33,520
just the Joe Rogan clips from the
union and then it's like quotes,

855
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:36,880
like they'll have pictures of you that
it'll say like let's nerf the world and

856
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:40,700
all your caught me and my most
indignant moment too, because when,

857
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,740
when we did that,

858
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:46,160
it was when I really had just
started smoking on a reg.

859
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:50,230
What year? What did we do this
2005 we would have interviewed you.

860
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:55,180
So I had only been smoking for
like five years. So I was, I was,

861
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,550
I was like gearing up with like my
frustration with the whole situation.

862
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:01,271
It was like,

863
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,960
it was really like you caught it at
the exact right time where I was having

864
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:07,170
these conversations with people where
they would say there's something wrong

865
00:49:07,171 --> 00:49:09,400
with pot and this and that. I don't
think it should be legal. I'm like,

866
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,300
what are you even yapping about?
Like what are you talking about?

867
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,720
You saying that it should be illegal to
have a beer because do you know how that

868
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:19,060
worked out? Did you ever hear
about that prohibition thing?

869
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,620
I went fucking crazy and organized crime
got a foothold in our society and I go,

870
00:49:23,621 --> 00:49:26,680
and guess what? That's exactly what's
going on right now. It's exact same thing.

871
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:30,850
It's just with marijuana and it's with
a bunch of other different substances

872
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:34,360
that are somehow or another still
getting sold everywhere all the time.

873
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:38,890
They're going to legalize everything.
It's, it's, it's crazy. That's,

874
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,720
you can't eat. You can't, I mean,

875
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:46,050
you got to let people know exactly
what everything does to you.

876
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:50,920
You got to take a massive amount
of taxes from the sale of anything,

877
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:53,650
whether it's marijuana or whether it's,
you know,

878
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,680
I don't know if you should be able
to sell the hard shit, you know,

879
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:58,420
but I think you should be
able to sell mushrooms.

880
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:01,870
I don't think you should be able to sell
like dangerous narcotics that we know

881
00:50:01,871 --> 00:50:04,750
are devastating to actual
life and towards society.

882
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:09,940
But if you can prove that something has
a history of human use, like mushrooms,

883
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,740
and you can prove this is a massive
amount of anecdotal evidence,

884
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,370
people have like changed their lives.

885
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:17,830
John Hopkins University
had this longterm study.

886
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,270
People did one mushroom trip
and 20 years later, they're,

887
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:24,550
they're fucking still like they're a
better person because of the experience.

888
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,690
It's like that kind of shit.

889
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:28,400
You hear those kinds of stories over
and over and over and over again,

890
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:32,870
and you're not. No one's dying. So
you feel like it. It's okay for this.

891
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,870
In this instance,
the argument's ridiculous.

892
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,800
It's ridiculous that you would try to
make this obviously massively beneficial

893
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:42,420
thing illegal. There's gotta be
something going on. Oh, you gotta,

894
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,560
you gotta see what we have
in store for the next one.

895
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,720
Brett wants take it to a whole new level.

896
00:50:46,721 --> 00:50:49,820
It's talking about some of the think
tanks of like why we get into this.

897
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:52,520
Like are we least effective when
caught up in group mentality. Right.

898
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:54,470
Because even when we
were in Parliament Hill,

899
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,250
we're talking to some of
the guys there and like,

900
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,570
like Brett was asking some questions,
key questions. Like he's like, you know,

901
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:02,420
cause they said they had to put a bill
through the day before and it was a

902
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,410
thousand pages and he was like,

903
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:06,860
how often is it that sometimes things
just get missed and they get passed and

904
00:51:06,861 --> 00:51:09,650
the guy was like more often than
you'd think. Well I'll just,

905
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:12,340
because people don't want to read like
it's at the end of the week and they're

906
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,480
like, oh there's a thousand
page bill that you want to read.

907
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,010
You go and you go through it.

908
00:51:16,011 --> 00:51:19,400
And then that's the stuff where the smear
campaigns come up years later. Right.

909
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:22,880
And they're like, he signed this thing
10 years ago and he was working for like,

910
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:25,070
whether it's the conservatives
and they were like, okay,

911
00:51:25,071 --> 00:51:26,200
we're all signing and like,

912
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:28,880
like he's going to go home and
after all the work he's done,

913
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:31,580
16 hour day at the hill,
go home and read a thousand page.

914
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,850
Boring is language ever
too, right? Like not,

915
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:38,660
we're not talking to any God and then try
to make sure that you understand every

916
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:42,110
line before you put your signature on it.
It's really a thousand pages.

917
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,070
That was the one that had
just been passed. Yeah.

918
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:47,660
How many days did this guy have
to work on that? Like they'd have,

919
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:49,730
they'd have a decision at the end
of the week. He was saying like,

920
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:53,930
and then they have a four hour vote. Like
it had been worked on for a long time,

921
00:51:53,931 --> 00:51:56,510
but by the time it got to
that stage and it's like they,

922
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,680
so did they have to read the whole 1000
well that said a lot of the times it

923
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:02,240
depends on who's dealing with it,

924
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:05,110
but who would ever expect
someone to be able to do this?

925
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:08,690
That's what I was looking like. It just,
the workload they have, like they were,

926
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:12,580
we were leaving at six and they were
going into a four hour vote for that.

927
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,260
And I was just like, oh my God.
I was like, I couldn't shit.

928
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:18,890
And they almost like we went to look
through and the, and the guy's like, oh,

929
00:52:18,891 --> 00:52:21,380
if you come through here,
you have to stay through the whole thing.

930
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:24,530
So if you come past this point, then you
cannot leave because it's in session.

931
00:52:24,531 --> 00:52:27,320
I was like, well, I'm not going near
there. Four hours, Jesus Christ die.

932
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:29,870
That will be the,
wow.

933
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,320
Did you see that recent video of the
woman from the DEA fielding questions

934
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:42,500
about, from posted on the gentleman
from Colorado who was, uh, asking,

935
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:43,783
uh,

936
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:49,180
if marijuana was less dangerous than
heroin and she's her bad and she wouldn't

937
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:55,100
respond, she was just like, well, we feel
that all illegal drugs are bad. It was,

938
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,890
have you seen it Brian? Oh my
God. Pull it up because it's,

939
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,670
it's preposterous what we move. What
would you Google? What would be the word?

940
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,910
I'd just put DEA,
DEA agent.

941
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:09,620
I'm stumped marijuana.

942
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:14,270
It was a lady with particularly sad eyes.

943
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:19,220
She really did. And she had
particularly sad eyes like I didn't,

944
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,670
I don't think there's any joy in that job.
And you,

945
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:24,020
when you know that you're just,

946
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:27,060
all you're doing is trying to keep people
from smoking pot because that's what

947
00:53:27,061 --> 00:53:29,490
they're telling you to do.
And there's no joy in that man.

948
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,670
That lady had no joy in her art.
We'll look at,

949
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,740
even though it wasn't eat
bleach as members of the team,

950
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,980
she's just doing her job. That's it.
Yeah, that's her. Yeah. I just hold up,

951
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:40,340
but just check by the dopey
i's a hilariously enough.

952
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,860
What does this gentleman's name?
Cause he's a bad motherfucker.

953
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:47,550
Re w what is his name then? Marijuana.
He's from Colorado. Let's give him props.

954
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,510
All illegal drugs are,

955
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:55,100
is methamphetamine worse for
somebody's health and marijuana?

956
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,670
I don't think any illegal
drugs. Heroin, a worse, uh,

957
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:05,850
for someone's health than
marijuana. Again, all, I mean,

958
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:10,060
I know that you can look this up.

959
00:54:10,061 --> 00:54:13,090
You should know this is the
chief administrator for the
Drug Enforcement Agency.

960
00:54:13,091 --> 00:54:16,330
I'm asking you a very straight forward
question. Is Heroin, Jared Polis,

961
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:21,170
mother Fucker, marijuana. We got to look
at getting him for the culture. Drugs are,

962
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:26,020
are bad. Just mean you don't know.
Heroin causes an addiction. Okay.

963
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:31,030
It causes, uh, causes many
problems is very hard to,

964
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,040
uh,
to what does that mean?

965
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:35,950
That the health impact of
heroin is worse than marijuana?

966
00:54:35,951 --> 00:54:38,050
Is that what you're telling me?
I think,

967
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,350
I think you're asking is the objective
question. No, it's objective. Uh,

968
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,070
just looking at the science, this is
your area of expertise. I'm a lay person,

969
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:47,410
but I've read,
read some of the home aware of it.

970
00:54:47,411 --> 00:54:49,600
I'm just asking you as an
expert in the subject area,

971
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:53,780
is heroin worse for someone's
health and marijuana? You know,

972
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,400
I'm answering as a police officer and
as a DEA agent that these drugs are

973
00:55:00,221 --> 00:55:04,560
illegal because they are dangerous
because they are addictive because they,

974
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,600
they do hurt a person's house. So heroin
is more addictive than marijuana. Heroin,

975
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:14,350
more dick of the marijuana.
I your experience generally
the properties of heroin.

976
00:55:14,351 --> 00:55:17,680
Yes. It's more addictive.
It's methamphetamine. More
addictive than marijuana.

977
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:19,600
Okay.

978
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,440
Well,
both are addictive ways.

979
00:55:23,441 --> 00:55:26,020
Is Methamphetamine more highly
addictive than marijuana.

980
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:34,150
I think some people become addicted to
marijuana and some people become addicted

981
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:37,850
to methamphetamine. You mentioned that
the top, and uh, your top priority,

982
00:55:37,851 --> 00:55:41,780
I believe you indicated to us is abuse
of prescription drugs is one of the main

983
00:55:41,781 --> 00:55:45,680
classifications of prescription drugs,
painkillers that you're concerned about.

984
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,110
That's correct. And are those
painkillers a addictive? Yes,

985
00:55:50,111 --> 00:55:54,380
they are very addictive. Uh, are those
painkillers more addictive than marijuana?

986
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:02,120
All illegal drugs are in
schedule one or addictive.

987
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:05,830
Oh my God.

988
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:11,460
It's amazing that that person in charge
of anything that has anything to do with

989
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:16,390
the legality of marijuana.
Well, see that's where we
want to show in the culture.

990
00:56:16,391 --> 00:56:19,600
High ride is there seems to be this global
cultural shift in the way people are

991
00:56:19,601 --> 00:56:23,950
looking at cannabis laws and the people
that are coming out now are more and

992
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:24,641
stuff than ever.

993
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:28,660
You're seeing some big names like several
members of the DEA that are now part

994
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:32,220
of leap that are talking out against
the big time. Well, it's a, it's a,

995
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:36,790
it's a crime. It's a criminal
thing. What they're doing,

996
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,350
what they're doing is
they're somehow or another,

997
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:43,351
they are being forced into a situation
where they're ignoring the science and

998
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:46,170
ignoring the, the, the, um,

999
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,620
health benefits and ignoring the
medicinal benefits and just the fact that

1000
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:52,470
people enjoy it and joy and,
and,

1001
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,140
and the fact that there's virtually no
one has ever died from it ever. Really.

1002
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:59,590
Realistically, no one has ever
die from it. Just that, just that,

1003
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,220
that anybody keeping you from that,
anybody that keeping you from that,

1004
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:06,580
that's not your friend, that's
not your friend. That's craziness.

1005
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,700
It's craziness that they think they
can keep you from an experience because

1006
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:11,770
that's really at the end of the day,
what it really is,

1007
00:57:11,771 --> 00:57:14,680
you're still responsible for your actions.
You shouldn't be driving.

1008
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,920
We baked out of your fucking head and
forget which way to turn the middle of an

1009
00:57:17,921 --> 00:57:21,070
intersection cause we'll fucking dark man.
I shouldn't ask you much nyquil.

1010
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,660
Exactly.
Exactly.

1011
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:27,040
But you should be responsible for your
actions and that that is what being a

1012
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:29,670
human being should be all about.
Carry your own weight,

1013
00:57:29,671 --> 00:57:33,250
take responsibility for the
sh the shit that you fuck up.

1014
00:57:33,251 --> 00:57:35,770
If you fuck up something
because you're high,

1015
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:39,690
like you'd go and smash a
window if it's not the high you.

1016
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,900
A lot of people could have been high in,

1017
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:43,450
they walk right by that window and
didn't want to break it at all.

1018
00:57:43,451 --> 00:57:47,110
You are an asshole man and you should
have to pay for that fucking window.

1019
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,420
But there's nothing to
do with weed. Joe, come,

1020
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:52,360
come run a nightclub and you want to
see a ticking time bomb. Oh my God,

1021
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:54,470
I couldn't.
Then there's people on booze where I've,

1022
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,850
I've had this conversation a million
times and I used to work the door and you

1023
00:57:57,851 --> 00:58:00,560
have to escort them l cause
they're too drunk. Right core.

1024
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,420
And then the mood when mean this
is a board and I'm like, yeah,

1025
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:07,990
where you're allowed to drink but
you can't get wasted. Right. So then,

1026
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:10,530
but then this goes around in
a circle and a big fine, fine.

1027
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,530
They get out the door and then
they forget and to come up.

1028
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:17,490
So when they get kicked, Oh man, cause
you're too drunk, dude. It's a board.

1029
00:58:17,491 --> 00:58:20,800
I'm like, I just went through this
wreck. Like, I honestly can't understand.

1030
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:23,190
I'm like, are you that like
is it really just goes in,

1031
00:58:23,191 --> 00:58:26,650
it goes blank and then goes blank and
keeps coming and then they start getting

1032
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,410
as you keep being nice and you're
like, listen, you're done for tonight.

1033
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:33,250
Come back tomorrow. I'll even, I'll even
pay your cover tomorrow if you come back.

1034
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:36,320
But tonight you're done. That's very
generous of, you know, and that's,

1035
00:58:36,321 --> 00:58:37,420
that was always the offer.
Be like,

1036
00:58:37,421 --> 00:58:39,730
I'll help you get a cab and a wave
your coverage to come back tomorrow,

1037
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:40,630
but tonight you're done.

1038
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,560
And then they take your kindness
Renin and they start being like, yeah,

1039
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:46,090
well then fucking and the
boost or like it just,

1040
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:50,710
you see them morph into this person
you like and I bet when he was sober he

1041
00:58:50,711 --> 00:58:52,590
would just be a nice guy.
But then there will suddenly,

1042
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,540
it's like he gets too drunk,
he wants to be an ass.

1043
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,800
You start off as polite as you can and
they'll be polite and then their emotions

1044
00:58:58,801 --> 00:58:59,261
shift.

1045
00:58:59,261 --> 00:59:04,261
And those any get dumbest thing to do
too is when you're out and you're drunk

1046
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,670
and you'd be a Douche bag to a bouncer.

1047
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:11,050
It's such a bad move.
I'm such a bad move.

1048
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,800
I've worked the door and I never got
that logic where someone's like, oh,

1049
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,460
well you make 10 books now where
you're trying to get the gold star.

1050
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:22,100
Some people are just assholes.
You know, we, you Kinda,

1051
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:25,250
I have a, uh, I mean,
it sounds ridiculous,

1052
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:29,120
but I have great respect for cops and
great respect for people who are working,

1053
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:32,180
you know, a security in a club or a
nightclub or something like that. Like,

1054
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,420
that's a, that's a difficult position.
It's a, it's a dangerous Bishan.

1055
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:39,020
Thank you very much. That's how I
feel about it. Like, so when I, if,

1056
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,070
if ever I'm in a situation, if I ever
was, I'm never are, but if I was,

1057
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,210
I'll be very polite. But no, sir. Uh,
you know, none, none, no craziness,

1058
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:50,930
no wanting to fight the cop,
you know, like Jesus Christ.

1059
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,690
Those people are assholes. It's, you know,

1060
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:56,930
you can't blame alcohol for those people.
I don't know what it is.

1061
00:59:56,931 --> 00:59:58,160
I don't know what causes it.

1062
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:01,610
But you can't blame alcohol when a guy
tries to punch a cop. You know those guys,

1063
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:05,420
like some people damages that.
It's like that's the thing you're serving.

1064
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:08,300
They see in colonial area,
there's a lot and a lot of growers.

1065
01:00:08,301 --> 01:00:10,640
That's how I knew so much about
the details of the union. Right.

1066
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:11,474
How it all broke down.

1067
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,650
I looked at getting into it when my dad
first died and he passed away like as to

1068
01:00:15,651 --> 01:00:17,480
supplement me to go to film school.
Right.

1069
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,810
I looked at being the Latin
landowner that would buy the house,

1070
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:23,800
have people that would grow for me,
I'd come back every three months,

1071
01:00:23,801 --> 01:00:28,100
but the cash 50 50 but then
dangerous. Is that dangerous? Right.

1072
01:00:28,101 --> 01:00:32,390
Canada is much more lenient
than it is in the u s for sure.

1073
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:36,410
But I, I didn't do it and that was
originally the beginning of the union.

1074
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:38,660
We cut my story out because we
thought at the end of the day,

1075
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:42,830
the union is so much bigger than my
story. It's not care. So we cut it out.

1076
01:00:42,831 --> 01:00:44,930
But that's what got us into that.

1077
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:46,700
And originally when we
were going to do the union,

1078
01:00:46,701 --> 01:00:49,550
we're just going to do an expo,
say the BC industry. Right.

1079
01:00:49,551 --> 01:00:53,210
And how it's so evolved and how like
there's a mortgage broker that'll help you

1080
01:00:53,211 --> 01:00:56,960
cause you got bad credit and they'll
send you to this banker to help put it

1081
01:00:56,961 --> 01:01:00,710
through and that you've got to realtor.
Like they all know, like even my,

1082
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:04,850
one of my friends worked at
a car dealership and they
went to their discretion

1083
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:08,660
whether or not things could flag. Is that
how that works? Well you know the banks,

1084
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:10,740
it's, why am I asking this? So
Am I going into organized crime?

1085
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:14,920
So nosy mill,

1086
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:18,260
it's interesting and it's one that some
people's favorite part of the union,

1087
01:01:18,261 --> 01:01:19,880
right?
But you can,

1088
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,880
that was where I felt guilty is that a
lot of these guys would come in in the

1089
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:23,990
wintertime.
Colona's Dad,

1090
01:01:23,991 --> 01:01:27,140
it's a summer town and they would come
in and they got the most disposable

1091
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,870
income because they've got some cash
that they of always put into things.

1092
01:01:29,871 --> 01:01:32,930
So then they come in and spend two or
three grand and that's awesome for us.

1093
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:36,920
Right? Like I'm like, yeah, and then but
I'm like, okay, who's the bad guy here?

1094
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:39,500
Like a lot of people say he's bad,
he's a drug dealer,

1095
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:44,360
he's growing but then I know what he
does and I'm gladly taking his money to

1096
01:01:44,361 --> 01:01:49,240
serve another drug. Right. So then I
was like, how am I any better? Right.

1097
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:50,780
He's not a drug dealer.

1098
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:54,470
He was selling weed or if
that is a completely different
connection than someone

1099
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:56,690
who will, who will sell you
something that's fucked up.

1100
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:59,360
True are dudes who are real drug

1101
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:03,680
casual about it.
Get people hooked.

1102
01:02:03,681 --> 01:02:05,820
There's people that are
like real clever about it.

1103
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,930
I've known the guys that have sold coke
and stuff. I owned a club through that.

1104
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:13,760
But it's, the problem is, is that
while it's still like the way it is,

1105
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:17,160
well a lot of them are controlled or
they get ripped off by gangs and fray.

1106
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,980
That's where it seems like

1107
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,140
now in Canada you can
get a federal license.

1108
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:24,480
That's the way a lot of guys are going.
If they don't have a criminal record,

1109
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:25,560
they can get a federal license.

1110
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:28,890
So there's no like here that you have
a state license and the feds come in,

1111
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:32,100
like you get a federal license and you
can grow. Why he does no reasons. Yeah.

1112
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:32,461
Okay.

1113
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:36,720
But don't you have like a dispute in
certain parts of Canada where there's far

1114
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:39,450
more conservative? They don't feel the
same way about marijuana and they do,

1115
01:02:39,451 --> 01:02:39,931
but that's,

1116
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:43,650
that is a federal license that they're
looking now to try to shut down,

1117
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:47,100
but it's to grow because there's people
whose looking to try shows down. Oh,

1118
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:51,180
the government's looking to change it,
change it back to make it not available.

1119
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,590
I'm not sure of all that.

1120
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,870
We have to dive into that one
as we get into the research.

1121
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:57,750
But they're trying to pull it back.
But it was interesting.

1122
01:02:57,751 --> 01:03:00,420
I just went into a huge grow op.
It just outside of my town,

1123
01:03:00,421 --> 01:03:05,421
there was a total legal one and it had
like 19 permits for like they could do

1124
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,700
the clones, they could store
for others, they could do huge,

1125
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:12,120
huge operational show you pictures on
my phone. It was like, I think they,

1126
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:17,160
I think they said they had 150 lights.
So if you,

1127
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:18,540
and they were getting high times,

1128
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:21,660
they're doing an article cause they
were getting 2.2 pounds of light.

1129
01:03:21,661 --> 01:03:23,520
So they're getting like 150 pounds,

1130
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:27,390
170 pounds every but completely legal.

1131
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:29,730
Like they had cameras when I was there,

1132
01:03:29,731 --> 01:03:33,060
the cops were coming through it with
them and this thing was so clean,

1133
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:37,560
Joe Bryant, they had offered music,
they had opera music playing in the,

1134
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:40,780
in the thing because planting in it
enhances their growth cycle. My God,

1135
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,290
I want to move to Canada,
I want to move to Canada.

1136
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:45,900
So they wanted me to come cause I was
a union guy. They're like, ah yeah,

1137
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:49,340
you can fill them anything you want
in here. And, and it was beautiful.

1138
01:03:49,341 --> 01:03:50,161
I'll show you guys some pictures.

1139
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:53,580
I got them on the phone is too
fucking stupid to let that happen.

1140
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:57,750
But that would be of great benefit
to people. It would provide jobs,

1141
01:03:57,930 --> 01:03:59,340
it would change the economy,

1142
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:02,340
and once marijuana became legal
than hemp could would become legal.

1143
01:04:02,341 --> 01:04:06,870
Then we'll have legal in Canada too, which
I know. Yeah, we were selling I'd on it.

1144
01:04:06,871 --> 01:04:10,350
We're going to start selling this hemp
protein powder. It's fucking awesome, man.

1145
01:04:10,351 --> 01:04:13,950
I've been, there's a dark chocolate,
I forget the the company's name,

1146
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:17,910
but I've been drinking this stuff really
steady for like a couple months now.

1147
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,890
It's like hemp, hemp protein
doesn't give me like terrible gas.

1148
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:25,770
It doesn't fuck with me.
It feels like really healthy.

1149
01:04:25,771 --> 01:04:30,300
It's like a really easily digestible plant
protein for me. I really love it man.

1150
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:33,030
It really been getting into it,
but we can't get any fucking hemp hearts.

1151
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,630
It's really hard. You can
only get 50 pounds a day.
That's the most you can order.

1152
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:41,260
So it's like the hemp part is just so
bizarre to me because that makes just 0

1153
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:45,280
million cents. So you can, like we
explained in the movie like super, yeah,

1154
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:49,950
you can use it manufacturer to ship at
everything but grow it here in the u s so

1155
01:04:49,951 --> 01:04:52,800
stupid because when people don't
even understand is like hemp is not

1156
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:56,390
psychoactive. Like you can't even
get high from it. It's, it's a,

1157
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:59,610
it's like a cousin plant to the
psychoactive version of marijuana.

1158
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:04,650
Although you could use marijuana as well.
You could use the stems and the sticks.

1159
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,120
I mean it's the same shit.
It's hemp.

1160
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:10,380
It's just that the flowers of the
marijuana plants are the ones that get you

1161
01:05:10,381 --> 01:05:13,090
high.
So it's not whether or not people could,

1162
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,930
I guess someone could pretend
like, oh, booth was Joseph. None,

1163
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:22,870
but I have beautiful flowers,
flowers. What would you say? Oh,

1164
01:05:22,871 --> 01:05:27,760
what happened here? This is a mistake.
Oh, how did this, how did this lie?

1165
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,090
Oh, well let me pull this
out. This is the devil.

1166
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:35,940
But the rest of them just for
making underwear and paper. Well,

1167
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,490
I think it, once it happened,
the thing is though,

1168
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:40,230
once it gets impregnated
then the whole crop,

1169
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:43,740
like you can't keep just the one or two
like that. You don't know enough about,

1170
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,310
I don't know enough about the botany
of how it grows, but I don't know.

1171
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,310
But I think a lot of people think too
is they don't realize like have you seen

1172
01:05:50,311 --> 01:05:53,580
some of the products it's being used for
like in the new Bugattis and stuff like

1173
01:05:53,581 --> 01:05:56,820
that. The interiors she, that
Lotus that they made out of him,

1174
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:02,240
they made a of this Badass Lotus and
it's like part of it was like just the

1175
01:06:03,241 --> 01:06:07,240
actual fiber, not even colored.
The actual fiber of bright.

1176
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:09,990
See if he could pull up a picture
of that cause it really is dope.

1177
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:14,670
Like Lotus handle car. Did you know
that Henry Ford's is that you're moving,

1178
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,170
you're moving.
Well that's not mine,

1179
01:06:16,171 --> 01:06:17,790
but there's a little clip
like that that there's,

1180
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:21,210
I know about Henry Ford stopped.
It was in the union. No,

1181
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:24,670
we do have an opening bit that talks big
about hemp, not Henry for his videos.

1182
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:27,580
Just that little clip that's up there
on its own. For folks who don't know,

1183
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:30,570
Henry Ford's first car
was made out of hemp,

1184
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:36,120
like he made him body panels that you see
that Lotus for folks who are following

1185
01:06:36,361 --> 01:06:40,170
us on Ustream, if you're not
just just Google, uh, hemp Lotus.

1186
01:06:40,171 --> 01:06:42,310
There's a couple other
pictures of this thing, um,

1187
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:44,330
that maybe you could see
it a little clearer, Brian.

1188
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:47,640
But what it is is they
made a car instead of like,

1189
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:50,310
like Corvettes are made out of fiberglass,
you know,

1190
01:06:50,311 --> 01:06:53,850
and like a really expensive cars. A lot
of them are made out of carbon fiber.

1191
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:58,830
Well this car is made out of hemp
and it's stronger than fiberglass.

1192
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:02,820
It's, it's a natural pride
or two lighter. They just,

1193
01:07:02,821 --> 01:07:06,480
there's a car in Canada, bill called
the crestal, that's an electric car.

1194
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:10,380
That's an all the interior and the
majority of the body home brown strip down

1195
01:07:10,381 --> 01:07:14,820
the front. That's exactly,
that's the actual hemp color.
That's the actual fiber.

1196
01:07:14,821 --> 01:07:18,690
It's so bad ass man.
And it's really fucking durable.

1197
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,100
It's a crazy plant.

1198
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:25,610
It's like you could get a stock and it's
really thick and it's light as fuck.

1199
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:30,630
Like you pick it up and like it feels
like nothing, but it's so dense,

1200
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:32,460
like it's really weird
if no one has ever seen.

1201
01:07:32,461 --> 01:07:36,210
If you've never seen a hemp stalk
before, it really does feel like, okay,

1202
01:07:36,211 --> 01:07:38,360
maybe this is an alien plant.
Like wait,

1203
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:41,070
maybe this is not like any plant
I've ever come in contact before.

1204
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:44,430
If you pick up an oak log, you know the
thickness and the would that would it?

1205
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,760
That feels like it's heavy
as shit. Right? Well,

1206
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:52,110
the hemp stocks feel like
the hardness of an oak log,

1207
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:55,050
but it's like really light.
It's weird.

1208
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:59,360
It's like where the fuck did this thing
come from? It's, it's crazy. I mean we, I,

1209
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:00,060
we knew,

1210
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:03,960
I knew nothing about pot
and when I started in the
Union now they wanted to do,

1211
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:07,580
that's hilarious. I just wanted to do,
like I said, the x was a to BC industry.

1212
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:09,360
Then when we discovered all these things,

1213
01:08:09,361 --> 01:08:12,450
that's why some people that really knew
everything in there was like, well,

1214
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,000
like a lot of the activists, like I knew
everything in the union. It was like,

1215
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,010
yeah, but oh, how dare you.

1216
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,980
Me and like 99% of other people don't.

1217
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:23,180
So there's a lot of weeks that know they
think that everybody should catch up.

1218
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:27,560
Yeah, I knew all that stuff will and,
and here's the Kudos that I even,

1219
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,610
I didn't really,
I,

1220
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:32,480
it really clicked with me when we were
parliament hill is that how entertained

1221
01:08:32,481 --> 01:08:35,030
they were. Right. And there's four
of them that weren't going to stay.

1222
01:08:35,031 --> 01:08:37,880
They're going to be there for 15 minutes
and they were going to leave and they

1223
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:40,490
stayed throughout the whole film.
And at the end they were saying that like,

1224
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,180
I didn't know it'd be that funny and I
didn't know what a B and Brett was like,

1225
01:08:44,181 --> 01:08:48,440
well that's the key to getting you to
absorb information is it still has to be,

1226
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:50,930
it's still a movie.
It has to be entertaining.

1227
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:52,490
If it was just a blurb and it was like,

1228
01:08:52,491 --> 01:08:56,120
here we are at or sometimes people
forget that most people don't know that

1229
01:08:56,121 --> 01:08:56,720
information.

1230
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:00,770
Most people don't and it you cannot
tell the story without giving that

1231
01:09:00,771 --> 01:09:04,970
information. If you want things to
be reached by a giant gang of people,

1232
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:08,360
you cannot assume that they already
have this information. It's too potent.

1233
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:11,330
It's too important. It's too
significant. And the story,

1234
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:14,210
well that's why we're diving into
the second one. We're going all out.

1235
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:16,660
What is the second one going to
get involved with the culture?

1236
01:09:16,661 --> 01:09:20,180
I we're looking much more global this
time and like I sold looking at the

1237
01:09:20,181 --> 01:09:23,870
cultural shift that's starting to happen
with regards to the way people look at.

1238
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,170
What do you accredit that
you, do you think the Internet
is responsible for that?

1239
01:09:27,171 --> 01:09:31,550
Is that we, yes. The distribution
of the truth about marijuana.

1240
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:34,940
That's exactly, that's actually a
part in it. We want to interview,

1241
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,510
you know Sean Parker and some of those
people like to talk about how the

1242
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:40,940
Internet, even the playing field,
like remembering the union.

1243
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:42,440
We have Ronald Reagan saying,
you know,

1244
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:45,470
and I'm surprised the scientists haven't
brought out this new information that

1245
01:09:45,471 --> 01:09:46,430
says that marijuana,

1246
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:49,640
it could be the most dangerous drug
that is in use in our society today.

1247
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:53,180
When he said that in the 80s like
unless you're going to go call a medical

1248
01:09:53,181 --> 01:09:56,480
facility and polar old records,
like you're like, hey man,
that's, that's present.

1249
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:56,960
He's,

1250
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:01,010
he must know he is a team that's giving
them that information and he's got it

1251
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,130
right. But now you can go on
Google and you can look at,

1252
01:10:04,131 --> 01:10:05,600
and of course you get
the good with the bad.

1253
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:08,090
There's a lot of fake and hate it when
people going back and forth for saying

1254
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:09,140
this.
But you know,

1255
01:10:09,141 --> 01:10:12,680
you can pick or choose through 10
10 or more articles and that's it.

1256
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:15,560
We did in the union,
we put all the links and stuff up there.

1257
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:18,710
So like if you didn't believe what we
said and like, hey, we're filmmakers,

1258
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:21,380
there's one or two little mistakes
and there that we made. Absolutely.

1259
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,230
But if it got you to research
it and start doing it,

1260
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:27,750
that's a great movie because
you're thinking about it
after you've watched with

1261
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,730
a factual mistakes that you missed
all their very, very slight.

1262
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,850
It was like with the original
declaration of independence,

1263
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:37,970
it was actually the first two drafts,
not the one that's in the museum,

1264
01:10:37,971 --> 01:10:39,650
the one that's in the
museum's made with high.

1265
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:41,900
But the first two drafts
were written on hemp.

1266
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:45,890
So it was a lot of his like clever were,
and then you know,

1267
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:49,280
same with the 30 days of marijuana
being in your system. Lester Grinspoon,

1268
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:53,230
the First Ivy League doctor to
come out and talk about, um, the,

1269
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:57,770
the real medical findings
that he discovered. He said,
it's not always 30 days,

1270
01:10:57,771 --> 01:11:00,110
like if you smoke all the time
and it's in your fat cells,

1271
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:02,480
but it can be if you just
smoke once in the first time,

1272
01:11:02,481 --> 01:11:05,870
there's a good chance in two weeks
we're going to be in your system. So,

1273
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:08,330
so when you hear about
a guy like Nick Diaz,

1274
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:13,070
kitten popped and he's got like
the non psychoactive metabolites,

1275
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,243
what does that mean?

1276
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,280
Does that mean he's like, he's like
really gotten any weakness system, right?

1277
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:22,880
Barely. Barely, barely. I
think that uh, you know, if,

1278
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:27,920
if they're gonna I mean those guys go
through so much pain and you've seen a lot

1279
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:31,320
of tragedy with the painkillers.
Now. Like, I mean, a friend of mine,

1280
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:36,000
Derek Boogaard who was, you know, an Nhl
enforcer, uh, for the New York Rangers,

1281
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:39,310
you know, how to, uh,
accidental mix and I, you,

1282
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:42,870
you'd wished that there would be that
alternative for pain. So maybe Nick Diaz,

1283
01:11:42,871 --> 01:11:46,410
his knuckles are sore. He hits people,
he hits dudes a lot of times in a fight,

1284
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:50,190
like more than anybody else. They
just don't stop. Right. So, you know,

1285
01:11:50,191 --> 01:11:53,190
maybe as he's got arthritis in
his hands are from training.

1286
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:56,180
That's what he wanted to
use. Like at how, by it,

1287
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,690
whatever the fuck reason he wants to use
it. But I'm saying even if that's my,

1288
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:01,920
my take on it now at this
point, it's like, yeah,

1289
01:12:01,921 --> 01:12:04,050
of course he should be
able to use it for anxiety.

1290
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:06,330
Of course he should be able
to use it for insomnia.

1291
01:12:06,331 --> 01:12:08,760
Of course he should be able to use it,
but he really,

1292
01:12:08,761 --> 01:12:11,550
he should be able to use it for whatever
the fuck he wants to use it for.

1293
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:16,551
And this idea that there's any reason
why it should be illegal is just crazy

1294
01:12:16,591 --> 01:12:21,300
talk. It's crazy talk. It makes
you a nicer person. It does.

1295
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:24,030
It might make some people a
little dope here, but guess what?

1296
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,860
That probably means you need
to get their shit together.

1297
01:12:25,861 --> 01:12:28,740
They're probably thinking a bunch of
dumb stupid shit when they're sober and

1298
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:31,320
when they're high,
there's not much to spin around in there.

1299
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:34,920
Maybe it's good for them to feel stupid.
Well think, think about it for the pain.

1300
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:36,330
I'm sure you know fighters,
Joe,

1301
01:12:36,331 --> 01:12:39,300
that if taken like the hard painkillers
and then a lot of notes that I need to

1302
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:41,310
realize their whole careers
because of that stuff.

1303
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:43,800
And they don't even know how addictive
it is. Right? The doctor says,

1304
01:12:43,801 --> 01:12:46,890
take this for pain. They get
hooked to it. So, I mean,

1305
01:12:46,891 --> 01:12:48,600
just that when I've seen in athletes,

1306
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:50,910
like they have to go through a lot
of pain and these constant man,

1307
01:12:50,911 --> 01:12:55,911
I know a dude who was a s a
really like completely clean guy.

1308
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:01,590
He didn't smoke cigarettes,
he rarely ever drank.

1309
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,560
He was a really healthy,
and he was a professional pool player.

1310
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:09,680
He hurt his back and he got hooked on
pain pills and became a complete total

1311
01:13:10,741 --> 01:13:15,540
mess and then died. I mean they,
they literally took this dude's life.

1312
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:20,390
This dude got swamped up in that world
of pills and he's younger than me and now

1313
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,470
he's gone. You know? And I, I knew him,

1314
01:13:22,471 --> 01:13:25,470
I knew him when he was totally healthy
and I knew him when he was gone.

1315
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:30,060
And that's crazy. It's crazy. It's a
sad thing. He was like proud, proud guy.

1316
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,850
And he would like fall asleep
in a plate of mashed potatoes,

1317
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,210
like that kind of shit.
And that's lead.

1318
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:38,380
See how many people I saw like that in
the Bardo. Like you'd see those, how many,

1319
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:42,360
you see these beautiful girls come in
and then like four years later they're

1320
01:13:42,361 --> 01:13:45,720
like, hey, and you're like, it's and a
lot of the dancers and you're like, Hey,

1321
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,870
oh my God. Like you look like you've
died and come back to life already sad.

1322
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:54,270
Those kind of drugs are so
terrible. They're so sad.
And your body, it's just a,

1323
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:57,830
it's a Shitty, I wouldn't recommend
owning a nightclub if someone,

1324
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,210
if someone said to me like,
Hey, I'll do like hi, just,

1325
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:04,350
I don't ever want to be in that business
again. Our business is rough man.

1326
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,240
You know?
So I'd rather,

1327
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,670
I'd rather be a challenge like a
struggling filmmaker that's, you know,

1328
01:14:08,671 --> 01:14:12,030
working three jobs like I am then
go back to that. Yeah. Well you,

1329
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:15,620
you dealing with groups of
drunks on a regular basis,

1330
01:14:15,621 --> 01:14:17,650
it's like and seeing and then you know,

1331
01:14:17,651 --> 01:14:20,710
seeing the sad stories like that or seeing
like times when a guy just got out of

1332
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:24,400
line and bumped into the wrong person
and got smashed. Yeah, that sucks too.

1333
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:28,300
I watched a guy get hit in the face
with a bottle once. It never, you know,

1334
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:30,760
I never expected this to
happen the way it happened,

1335
01:14:30,761 --> 01:14:32,410
the way the guy hit the guy in the face,

1336
01:14:32,411 --> 01:14:36,190
it was like there's no way he just did
that for that reason. It was like nothing.

1337
01:14:36,191 --> 01:14:38,680
And this kind of smashed him in the face,
cut his face.

1338
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:42,550
And I remember thinking now like always
be aware that it's possible that someone

1339
01:14:42,551 --> 01:14:45,550
out there is so fucking crazy that they
would do that for no reason like that.

1340
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:47,320
Oh,
that's why when I worked the door,

1341
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:50,590
I never let someone get to the odd side
of me or anything like that. Right.

1342
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,520
And a lot of the times it's some ways
aggressive in their hands. Clench.

1343
01:14:54,521 --> 01:14:57,520
You don't see it. I mean we would, I
always tell them, I was like, listen,

1344
01:14:57,521 --> 01:15:00,880
you're not supposed to strike and hit
guys, but if, if you're really threatened,

1345
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:02,320
right.
And some guy you're in a corner,

1346
01:15:02,321 --> 01:15:04,360
like you do what you got to do
to look after yourself. Right.

1347
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:07,720
We'll try to get there as fast as we can.
But I mean we had a doorman stabbed,

1348
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,890
oh shit,

1349
01:15:08,891 --> 01:15:11,740
he got stabbed three times and probably
the only time in your life you like to

1350
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:13,150
hear this,
they told them they're like,

1351
01:15:13,151 --> 01:15:16,540
it's a good thing you're
overweight because if you
would have been an inch thick

1352
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:18,190
inch thinner it would appears major.

1353
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:21,400
Cause the guy that got Dave through these
guys out with the guys went out to the

1354
01:15:21,401 --> 01:15:22,234
car,

1355
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:26,470
came back and then they went at the
Dorman and one of our dorm and knocked the

1356
01:15:26,471 --> 01:15:28,570
first one out.
Then he went with the other one.

1357
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:32,010
He was tussling with him and he said he
put him down and then when he put them

1358
01:15:32,011 --> 01:15:34,690
down and he saw the blade hit the
ground and blood all over it and then he

1359
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:38,410
punched in the side and then
he looked and he was like holy.

1360
01:15:38,411 --> 01:15:39,460
It was just pouring out and uni.

1361
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:42,430
And then I remember him telling the story
that really scared me as he sat down

1362
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:45,190
and he went to our other dorm and
just being like, if I pass out,

1363
01:15:45,191 --> 01:15:46,690
please make sure I get to the hospital.

1364
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,530
Cause you don't know what's
going to happen if your
body's going to shut down or

1365
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:53,830
like, you know, you might just faint
out, but you're, you know, so it's, it's,

1366
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:58,140
it's shitty. I, I'd never want to let
another nightclub. Fuck that. Yeah.

1367
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,580
There's just too many douche bags.
They can't keep it together.

1368
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:05,910
It's too many people out there really
at the roadhouse pay hurts really at the

1369
01:16:06,821 --> 01:16:08,760
heart of it, at the bottom at all. It's,

1370
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:11,260
it's really people doing a
shitty job of raising people,

1371
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,890
people doing a shitty job of having
a community and doing a shitty job of

1372
01:16:14,891 --> 01:16:17,650
raising people. And what do you
make? You make shit kids. No Shit.

1373
01:16:17,651 --> 01:16:21,490
Kids grow up to be gigantic fucking
problems. And if you run a nightclub,

1374
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,210
congratulations, you're the new
babysitter. Well you're a new,

1375
01:16:24,211 --> 01:16:28,270
the new babysitter for the drunken Douche
bag and then anything that they do,

1376
01:16:28,271 --> 01:16:30,910
like they're not held responsible.
Like if they, that's where,

1377
01:16:30,911 --> 01:16:32,440
going back to the responsibility thing,
you were saying,

1378
01:16:32,441 --> 01:16:35,650
people should just be held
to their actions where what
you get for nightclub and

1379
01:16:35,651 --> 01:16:38,500
you can get sued then they go out,
not just that.

1380
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:42,940
They go and fight or hurt someone or they
attack our bouncers and then they get

1381
01:16:42,941 --> 01:16:45,940
hurt on the way out. And yes, of
course there's other sides that were,

1382
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:49,240
sometimes the doormen are excessive,
but there's times where guys so drunk,

1383
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:51,640
they like, you carry him out,
you don't, you go to let him go.

1384
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:55,000
And he stumbles and smashes his face on
the concrete and caves his cheekbone.

1385
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:59,490
And right, like I worked as a
security guard at great woods, uh,

1386
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:02,970
center for the performing art. It's like,
it's like in Mansfield or something,

1387
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:06,430
Massachusetts. I think that's where
it's at. And it's, um, it's um,

1388
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,250
this outside performance
area. So it's, it's a part

1389
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,130
of it is inside and part
of it is like covered,

1390
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:17,090
but then there's a back area that's
open that's like a lawn area.

1391
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:21,140
And I was security there and we did it
for a whole summer. And I tell you, man,

1392
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:26,710
after a while you really develop
this us versus them mentality.

1393
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:29,720
And it's really stupid. But
I was 19. I was an idiot.

1394
01:17:29,721 --> 01:17:31,610
I shouldn't have been in that
sort of a job in the first place.

1395
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:36,260
And the guy that I was working for
was carets. He aggressive. I mean,

1396
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,180
oh my God,
I saw him on the first day.

1397
01:17:38,181 --> 01:17:42,590
I worked there Taqa guy and beat him with
a walkie talkie because the guy stole

1398
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:45,330
their golf cart. They had a golf
cart, they would drive around the,

1399
01:17:45,331 --> 01:17:46,250
the great woods width.

1400
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:49,340
So these guys tackle them and they
beat the shit out of this guy with a,

1401
01:17:49,341 --> 01:17:54,130
with a walkie talkie. That dude was a
classic. His name was alley cat. And uh,

1402
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:57,140
he wanted to open up this bar.
He had this dream, you know,

1403
01:17:57,141 --> 01:18:01,100
he was the head security guy with a dream
and his dream was to open up this bar

1404
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:05,450
alley cats, libations and victuals. And
I remember it was the title. Yeah, yeah,

1405
01:18:05,451 --> 01:18:10,220
yeah. Because marketing,
those are the victuals is,
was like a cool name for food.

1406
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:14,750
And libations is like a cool
old name for liquors and drink.

1407
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,790
And so that was his, that was his
dream. And he was a crazy motherfucker.

1408
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:23,270
And he ran, he ran the security thing and
it was me and a friend of mine who was,

1409
01:18:23,271 --> 01:18:28,250
uh, we were, um, on the same competition
teams, same taekwondo competition team.

1410
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:31,160
He got a job there and they said,
do you have any,

1411
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:34,280
any of the other guys that are
martial arts guys that want a job?

1412
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:39,430
And so they essentially hired all the
top martial arts guys from this Jay Kim

1413
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:43,580
Taekwondo Institute. And they were all
the security for this place. But I was,

1414
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:45,770
I was like,
this is the craziest idea ever.

1415
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,640
He was like seven or
eight people you know,

1416
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:52,040
that have like the security jackets
on and it was like fucking thousand.

1417
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,070
Oh yeah.
Thousands of crazy assholes.

1418
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:58,460
And I will always wear a
jacket over my security jacket.

1419
01:18:58,461 --> 01:19:01,910
Like I would just try to blend
in as much as possible. I'm like,

1420
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,700
I'm way too short for this
too. I'm only five, eight.

1421
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:07,910
I can't be around like big giant
dudes with a security jacket on.

1422
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:09,230
That shit's ridiculous.
You know,

1423
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:12,740
I want to have to fucking punch and kick
my way out of this. Oh well that was,

1424
01:19:12,741 --> 01:19:14,450
I remember there'd be slow nights,
right,

1425
01:19:14,451 --> 01:19:17,870
where you'd have a big rowdy
like sports team come in, right.

1426
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:20,690
And it'd be like the bartender
and you'd have one dorm and on,

1427
01:19:20,691 --> 01:19:23,240
cause it's a slow night or
two and then you'd literally,

1428
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:25,430
they begin rowdy and
starting to smash glasses.

1429
01:19:25,431 --> 01:19:28,340
And then literally we'd have to
think like, okay, like be ready,

1430
01:19:28,341 --> 01:19:31,280
like Gba ready to jump over the
bar if you have to help. Right.

1431
01:19:31,281 --> 01:19:34,450
If these guys get to a point where they
really want to cause something that you

1432
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:34,591
say,

1433
01:19:34,591 --> 01:19:37,760
it can be so weird that you just politely
ask them to do something and then they

1434
01:19:37,761 --> 01:19:40,880
get super aggressive. Well
I then, and then they,

1435
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:43,600
then they just really look at
size where they're like, fuck,

1436
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:46,910
there's like nine of us and we're all
in good shape and there's only two or

1437
01:19:46,911 --> 01:19:51,170
three of them. Like why do I
have to respect this guy? Yeah,

1438
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:52,911
it can get bad.

1439
01:19:52,911 --> 01:19:56,390
But what a lot of people didn't know it
was in a small town is a lot of like the

1440
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:58,820
people hanging out.
We're really good friends with the staff.

1441
01:19:58,821 --> 01:19:59,930
They come there all the time.

1442
01:19:59,931 --> 01:20:03,380
So the odd times that that
happened when I was doing it,

1443
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:06,010
you'd have people jump in from outside.
Right?

1444
01:20:06,011 --> 01:20:09,330
Cause they was like serve as
the community more or less you,

1445
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:10,970
you'd have friends that just the common,

1446
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:14,460
you know when their regular you treat
them good and then they'd come in and I'll

1447
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:17,580
tell you the one time my dad was friends
with a lot of the big Mc guys and when

1448
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:21,450
they used to come in there was never a
problem in the bar because everyone was

1449
01:20:21,451 --> 01:20:23,610
worried about bumping into,
one of them are like,

1450
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:26,160
you know some idiots wrestling
and they fall into a table.

1451
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:32,210
So like it was weird on those nights it
would be is usually the young like just

1452
01:20:32,311 --> 01:20:35,670
starting to slang little gang bangers
that think that they're all that and they

1453
01:20:35,671 --> 01:20:37,260
have something to prove and they,

1454
01:20:37,261 --> 01:20:40,050
they're doing something for somebody
else where they've got some kind of

1455
01:20:40,051 --> 01:20:42,480
connections are nutty Gig for you man.

1456
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:47,490
And to be only 23 years of age and having
a handle all that. Oh Man. My, my wife.

1457
01:20:47,491 --> 01:20:50,350
That's, that's, I mean why I married
her. She was a trooper through that too.

1458
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:52,880
Did it last before you got
rid of it? Oh, I had to get,

1459
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:57,390
my dad passed away in 2003 and we were
out of there by 2005 so for two years you

1460
01:20:57,391 --> 01:20:58,061
got to run that mother.

1461
01:20:58,061 --> 01:21:01,540
If I had to get proper books because
my dad didn't do proper books. Oh.

1462
01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:05,760
And so to sell to a legit buyer, they
wanted to use two or three years of books.

1463
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:10,710
Right. I talk to my friend Bobby. Yeah,
well that was over the situation. Well,

1464
01:21:10,711 --> 01:21:14,370
trust me, there was lots of
bad Bobby's coming around.
But my thing was like, okay,

1465
01:21:14,371 --> 01:21:19,080
if I took it is only one bad. Bobby, you
don't know bad by, I mean, I mean bad,

1466
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:22,080
but guys that would come
with a cash offer. Right?

1467
01:21:22,081 --> 01:21:25,860
And then if there's a cash offer that
sounds like bad Bobby. Well, but then,

1468
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:28,500
but then in three years, if it doesn't
do the numbers they think and they say,

1469
01:21:28,501 --> 01:21:33,450
well, I don't think I overpaid. I
want some back. Right. So that's like,

1470
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:36,540
that's why I was like, okay, I
don't want to go that option.

1471
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:41,070
So tried to work it out with like a
childhood friend and then you know,

1472
01:21:41,071 --> 01:21:43,560
didn't do that right either because
we didn't put everything on paper.

1473
01:21:43,561 --> 01:21:45,870
So I got screwed and had to start for,

1474
01:21:45,871 --> 01:21:49,350
I remember when my wife was eight months
pregnant with Riley and my daughter and,

1475
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,610
and uh,

1476
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:55,610
we had negative $400 in our account and
I needed $45,000 to finish the union and

1477
01:21:56,761 --> 01:21:57,930
I didn't know where I was going to get it.

1478
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:01,890
Suck that Dixon to just think
about it. No, fuck about us.

1479
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:04,200
You can find a rich guy and
suck his dick for a million.

1480
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:07,530
I was in New York and worked around those
guys would be no way. Yeah. Would if,

1481
01:22:07,531 --> 01:22:11,040
you know, like for whatever reason you
got flown to John Travolta's house.

1482
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:17,450
No, no, no man, I got bad stories
about those lists and you know, man,

1483
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,580
I did that stuff in New York.
I lived in a model house in New York.

1484
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,690
Not that I don't want to get you in
anything. You don't want to talk about it,

1485
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:28,170
but, no, no, no, no. Me a nod to gay.

1486
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:34,260
Never for the record. Never did any
gain shit shorty. I'm sure. But uh, no.

1487
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:36,040
I lived in a model house
cause I used to work for men.

1488
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:39,480
Thank you for it not getting upset.
Oh, I know. I wouldn't get upset.

1489
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,690
I've listened to your show. I've
listened since you guys had snowflakes.

1490
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,200
I know that the shows that well. Yeah.
Well we've hung out a bunch of time span.

1491
01:22:46,201 --> 01:22:48,900
It was fun.
The UFC a up in Vancouver,

1492
01:22:48,901 --> 01:22:51,790
but right now I don't think they can
come back. I think, I don't know.

1493
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:54,720
I think there's some problem
with the regulatory, well,

1494
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:56,250
I want to try to come see me in Calgary.

1495
01:22:56,430 --> 01:23:00,640
There was some sort of a ruling against
a MMA of Vancouver. I'm come on,

1496
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:04,590
really trying to remember what the actual
ease, no problem was. Yeah, let me,

1497
01:23:04,591 --> 01:23:06,100
let me Google this real

1498
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:10,000
quick. I don't know man.
You know, it's like friends,

1499
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:13,150
like it's a fucking problem
all over the world, dude.

1500
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:18,070
People Successful Shows York that want
to see the UFC and somehow or another

1501
01:23:18,071 --> 01:23:21,450
it's been um, uh, what am I going to do?

1502
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:24,790
They still sell players cigarettes in
Canada. Oh, you bet. Wow. That's great.

1503
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:28,720
What am I Google it again? Jesus Christ.
UFC. Now going back to Vancouver.

1504
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:31,330
Vancouver, right. You guys
are coming to Calgary soon.

1505
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:34,930
That's not far from where I am. Well,
eight hour drive. I got so upset.

1506
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:38,530
I was the all I can think of as Bob Riley,
I start thinking about New York.

1507
01:23:38,531 --> 01:23:42,040
I completely spaced on Vancouver because
the New York thing drives me fucking

1508
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:46,480
crazy. So illogical and it's
so corrupted. It's so gross.

1509
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:50,170
The people of New York would make a
lot of fucking money if they came.

1510
01:23:50,171 --> 01:23:54,160
If the UFC came to Madison Square Garden,
it would be fucking huge.

1511
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:59,310
How about this John Jones versus Anderson
Silva or Anderson Silva versus George

1512
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:01,950
Saint Pierre,
something like that.

1513
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:06,720
Inside Madison fucking square garden
and I'm like a kid in Canada. I would,

1514
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:11,460
that's our cots are keeping that from
happening. That could fucking happen.

1515
01:24:11,690 --> 01:24:15,660
What's the hole back there?
Some,

1516
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:20,910
I don't even want to name names,
political bullshit, nonsense, culinary,

1517
01:24:20,911 --> 01:24:23,040
union, fucking whatever, whatever.

1518
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:26,720
A lot of corruption as people
are getting greased, the,

1519
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:31,650
the desire of the people is
getting ignored. People want
to have it in the state.

1520
01:24:31,651 --> 01:24:35,550
It generates money. The amount of fans
that they have in New York City alone,

1521
01:24:35,551 --> 01:24:37,840
it's fucking through the roof.
Everywhere you look,

1522
01:24:37,841 --> 01:24:41,880
there's a Jujitsu school in New
York does MMA, gyms, boxing gyms.

1523
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:47,150
People are allowed to enjoy it and for
some asshole politician with some fucking

1524
01:24:48,661 --> 01:24:52,230
backing by whatever creepy organization
that's trying to keep this shit out,

1525
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:55,080
it's ridiculous because it
violates the will of the people.

1526
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:58,680
Anybody that does that is a shit
politician. That's a sad statement.

1527
01:24:58,681 --> 01:25:00,540
That's an anti American thing to do.

1528
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:04,860
You're trying to keep something away from
people that want it and you're trying

1529
01:25:04,861 --> 01:25:07,890
to block a business and you're trying to
do it because you're in cahoots with a

1530
01:25:07,891 --> 01:25:11,970
different business. That should be
illegal, but shit, that's corruption.

1531
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:13,460
I can picture.
I did.

1532
01:25:13,461 --> 01:25:16,250
It's not a mirror would be a mistake
within our come back to Vancouver.

1533
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:18,200
It's not American.

1534
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:23,810
You're leaving Vancouver for Calgary.
Yeah. You guys are coming to Calgary.

1535
01:25:23,811 --> 01:25:25,840
That's all good.
I don't know man.

1536
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:30,530
I feel still watch NBC,
but okay,

1537
01:25:30,531 --> 01:25:34,980
here's the latest legislation opens
door for ultimate fighting championship.

1538
01:25:34,981 --> 01:25:38,630
You okay? So this sounds
good. Maybe I read that wrong.

1539
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:41,730
I can't pay attention everything folks.
The fucking,

1540
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:43,760
I know people always go with me.

1541
01:25:43,761 --> 01:25:46,730
Some people try to come up with the
toughest questions about marijuana and be

1542
01:25:46,731 --> 01:25:49,670
like, what do you think about this law
that was passed in Missouri two weeks ago?

1543
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:53,990
And I'm like, man, sorry. I do my best
to try to stay up to date on everything,

1544
01:25:53,991 --> 01:25:58,190
but I, it is physically impossible. I
don't know what's going on in Missouri.

1545
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,980
So they did stop it.
They,

1546
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:04,860
there was an introduction of a provincial
law designed to break the directed a,

1547
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:09,380
the deadlock over regularly regulation
and supervision of Combat Sports.

1548
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:13,730
So originally they stopped it and now
they're trying to figure out the correct

1549
01:26:13,731 --> 01:26:15,830
way to regulate what's going on.

1550
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:21,200
Now it seems like they're opening the door
to it. Coming back. I think people do,

1551
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:23,360
you know, ultimately the
here, the will of the people,

1552
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:26,990
especially today so popular in Canada,
people don't even understand.

1553
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:30,830
It's hugely popular in America.
Way more popular in Canada. No,

1554
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:33,470
it's like in Canada. It's not like
when there's a UFC, it's not like,

1555
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:36,140
are you watching the fights? It's like,
where are you going to watch the fights?

1556
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:40,070
Like dude,
we were at the fucking watchers arena.

1557
01:26:40,071 --> 01:26:43,640
That gigantic Roger Center,
whatever it is. What is it called?

1558
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:47,990
Is it the Roger Center? The things
crazy building that's, it's so big.

1559
01:26:47,991 --> 01:26:49,340
There's a hotel inside of it.

1560
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,980
There's a hotel inside of it and
they used to play baseball indoors.

1561
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:56,820
That's how big this place is. And
it was filled for the, I mean,

1562
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:59,810
I don't know if they could do that
in America. I mean, maybe they could.

1563
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:01,490
It was George Saint
Pierre and Anderson Silva.

1564
01:27:01,491 --> 01:27:06,250
I guarantee you they could do
that in America. But that's
a big goddamn crowd. No,

1565
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:11,150
it's Canada's nutty for it. We, it
has less people. Yeah, we're, we're,

1566
01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:13,690
but I think that comes a lot
with the hockey culture, right?

1567
01:27:13,691 --> 01:27:15,620
There's been fighting in the
hockey culture for years,

1568
01:27:15,621 --> 01:27:17,900
which is like our national sport.
I hate to say this,

1569
01:27:17,901 --> 01:27:22,220
but I think there's more fucking manly
men per capita in Canada or more condoms.

1570
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:27,200
I just think, you know, I
think they, I think you come
from a country, first of all,

1571
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:31,070
that has to survive the cold. Right? And
I think that's good for your character.

1572
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:33,020
You know, I've always compared, uh,

1573
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:36,870
people that have it soft to people that
had it tough and you always see the

1574
01:27:36,871 --> 01:27:41,180
people that have had like
the most interesting people
that I know are all people

1575
01:27:41,181 --> 01:27:44,890
that had it tough. You know, when
you have, it's soft, it's easy,

1576
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:48,940
just come out fucking useless.
When they got it, they got those,

1577
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,560
those battle scars, even if
they're not physical ones. Right.

1578
01:27:51,561 --> 01:27:54,440
The wounds of going through that.
That's a lot of times people said,

1579
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:56,000
I have an old soul for,

1580
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:59,150
that's one of the gas thing someone can
ever say to you and you need to get away

1581
01:27:59,151 --> 01:28:02,930
from him. Probably trying to fuck you.
Right. If it's a dude, especially,

1582
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:06,050
it was a woman who she's
definitely trying to fuck you.

1583
01:28:06,051 --> 01:28:07,410
Look at your handsome ambassador.
No,

1584
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:11,780
I was at a restaurant once and I actually
heard that hack line, that old soul,

1585
01:28:11,781 --> 01:28:15,050
a guy was like reading a book.
It was the weirdest thing, man.

1586
01:28:15,051 --> 01:28:19,070
He's an actor that was in, um, I
don't even want to say his name,

1587
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,280
just some weird old actor that was in a
bunch of movies and then they probably

1588
01:28:22,281 --> 01:28:25,160
went crazy.
So he's sitting by himself with a book,

1589
01:28:25,161 --> 01:28:27,080
which is what you do at a restaurant
if you go to a nice place.

1590
01:28:27,081 --> 01:28:31,070
And so there's this couple next to
me just starts introducing himself.

1591
01:28:31,071 --> 01:28:33,890
Would you do, sorry, sorry.
Glitch. Yeah. He just,

1592
01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:37,460
he starts introducing himself into
their conversation and talking to them.

1593
01:28:37,461 --> 01:28:42,140
And then he's like telling this, uh, this
man that he has an old soul that's lame.

1594
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:45,980
And I'm like, not now you're making me
feel that I use that choice of words. No,

1595
01:28:45,981 --> 01:28:50,720
it's, I mean it's look you, you,
you said what you mean, you know,

1596
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:53,900
it's not nothing wrong with it,
but I had a funny old soul story so yeah,

1597
01:28:53,901 --> 01:28:57,200
I did just have a funny, a funny
image. He like wore a Bandana.

1598
01:28:57,201 --> 01:29:00,590
He's one of those assholes sit by himself
eating dinner with a Bandana on his

1599
01:29:00,591 --> 01:29:02,010
head. Okay. What the

1600
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:05,340
fuck are you doing? Reading
a book? We used to get those
guys in the nightclub to,

1601
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:07,830
they'd come in and sit in the corner,
read a book. It's like really?

1602
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,680
This probably the loudest,
most annoying place to read it.

1603
01:29:10,681 --> 01:29:12,960
You're better off just to have a drink
and stare at the girls cause that's what

1604
01:29:12,961 --> 01:29:14,310
you really would like that though.
You know,

1605
01:29:14,311 --> 01:29:16,170
it's like some people
like to work at Starbucks,

1606
01:29:16,171 --> 01:29:18,270
they want to hear people
come in and come out.

1607
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:22,220
That I could understand but a nightclub
like we can't even hear yourself think

1608
01:29:22,221 --> 01:29:27,210
like that shit man. People are weird.
You know, he pulled a weird dude.

1609
01:29:27,211 --> 01:29:30,420
I don't have to tell you.
You were running a god Damn Strip Club,

1610
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:33,600
Strip club connection at 23 years of age.

1611
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:38,610
How did you avoid getting sucked into
the clutches of organized crime? I just,

1612
01:29:38,611 --> 01:29:41,970
well I left originally when I was younger
and went to New York and I wanted to

1613
01:29:41,971 --> 01:29:46,890
get into the film industry and
stuff like that. So I, I, I just,

1614
01:29:46,891 --> 01:29:48,120
I don't know,
when I came back I never,

1615
01:29:48,121 --> 01:29:51,270
it wasn't much of a big drinker and
wasn't into the party scene. So I was,

1616
01:29:51,271 --> 01:29:54,570
luckily I didn't fall into that.
That trap.

1617
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,510
It was union was like the first
thing you ever did. Really? Yeah.

1618
01:29:57,511 --> 01:30:01,440
The first thing I'd ever produced. Yes.
Did such a fucking bang up job of it, man.

1619
01:30:01,441 --> 01:30:04,760
And you, you went to some
real creepy places like you,

1620
01:30:04,761 --> 01:30:08,580
you were like sort of an investigative
reporter in, you know, in that movie.

1621
01:30:08,581 --> 01:30:12,570
Like when you went to those places where
you went to those drain tiles. Yeah, man,

1622
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,520
explain that cause that's of crazy.

1623
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:17,050
Well we knew the people that were
busted in there and obviously,

1624
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:18,730
and explain what the situation.
Okay.

1625
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,430
Well there is for the
people listening at home,

1626
01:30:20,431 --> 01:30:23,580
didn't know there was 20 full size,
like those square,

1627
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:24,870
they're not actual train cards,

1628
01:30:24,871 --> 01:30:28,320
but they're the cargo carts that they
put on the trains and they'd actually

1629
01:30:28,321 --> 01:30:31,800
buried them and connected them together
so that if you were to look at them that

1630
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:36,120
it'd be five rows with two each way. So
like, or no, 10 rows with two each way.

1631
01:30:36,121 --> 01:30:40,440
So like 20 full sized train cars buried
underground and they had a giant grow up

1632
01:30:40,441 --> 01:30:44,940
under there and it was 10 miles in the
mountain where there isn't a neighbor.

1633
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:46,170
You can hear the craziest part joke.

1634
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:49,680
The guy that got that busted actually
snuck in there and took pictures one night

1635
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:54,370
to show the cops so they can go,
oh my God.

1636
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:56,880
Balls and way up in the
Bush like way the fuck out.

1637
01:30:56,881 --> 01:31:00,180
They're balls of adamant
Tanium oh man. But yeah, that,

1638
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:03,570
that had 287 lights.
What is Wolverine's bones?

1639
01:31:03,610 --> 01:31:05,440
Adamantium but that's
how I always said and

1640
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:12,030
she's a soccer balls to 287 lights and
they were both going to make just the

1641
01:31:12,031 --> 01:31:15,110
growers that I knew in there. We're
going to make half a million in one year.

1642
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:20,370
And so what happens now, because
it's not lake, they got routed.

1643
01:31:20,371 --> 01:31:24,740
So we got very lucky. One of them
got nothing. Got It. Totally wiped.

1644
01:31:24,741 --> 01:31:28,650
The lawyer got her off and the other guy
just got house arrest and had to pay a

1645
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:32,860
big fine. Whoa. Yeah.

1646
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:37,130
Canada is going at it. Gangster
style. I like it because it's,

1647
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,860
they also have a lot of money
to fight it in court right now.

1648
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,540
Don't wait that man.
I think Canada is probably,

1649
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:46,680
it's very obviously being influenced
by the policies of the United States.

1650
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:49,860
Definitely the, the United
States has like, you know,

1651
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,920
they have set parameters for Canada
and told them very specifically,

1652
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:56,610
they don't want them making marijuana
illegal or making illegal rather,

1653
01:31:56,850 --> 01:32:00,460
I mean this has been this, it's been
held up by your carrot, you know,

1654
01:32:00,810 --> 01:32:04,050
and whenever you know,
discussions, we have diplomacy me,

1655
01:32:04,051 --> 01:32:06,940
we'll kind of diplomacy that we have when
we're, we'll let completely connected,

1656
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:10,270
you know, I mean are, we will never,
you know, Canada in the United States,

1657
01:32:10,271 --> 01:32:13,120
it's so weird that we're two
separate countries. Really. It is,

1658
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:16,600
cause we're connected.
You can drive there everywhere you get.

1659
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,450
The whole thing is drivable.
Well that's,

1660
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:21,770
that's why I see where may not really
this woods, you know, we're, we're,

1661
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:25,510
we're Kalona is clone is rate on a border
there and I'm the lake and there's a

1662
01:32:25,511 --> 01:32:30,010
lake in a serious, that's got half of
it as in the u s and half it is Canada.

1663
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:33,310
So you can drive your boat out.
Right. And then you're like,

1664
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:35,970
and they're there and they're
there. Yeah. The marine guys,

1665
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:40,610
my verve or all day long. That's so
gross. That's so fucking North Korea, man.

1666
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:42,640
And it's, yeah, it's bizarre
when you think about it,

1667
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:45,040
but there was guys I knew from
Colona that were smuggling,

1668
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:48,850
they'd get these one body submarines and
go underneath it so they could get into

1669
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:53,050
the, it's so eggs, submarines,

1670
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:57,670
Jesus Christ. It's, it's literally, if
you see Colona it's late. It's, it looks,

1671
01:32:57,671 --> 01:32:59,890
they're the rock stars.
Like if they're doing well,

1672
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:04,990
especially in the late nineties when the
US dollar was like nine 55 cents on the

1673
01:33:04,991 --> 01:33:09,220
Canadian dollar and they were getting
like 4,500 us a pound and then that was

1674
01:33:09,221 --> 01:33:13,840
transferring to like 6,000 Canadian.
Wow. They were making a killing.

1675
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:19,000
It's amazing man. And in,
in Colona like NBC a lot.

1676
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:19,631
Like we sadly,

1677
01:33:19,631 --> 01:33:23,860
it's like one in seven is
what the economists said of
like living dwelling units

1678
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:27,310
or one in 100 it has it.
And then the grow ops,

1679
01:33:27,311 --> 01:33:31,120
like when you say they're in
the almost one in 100 has,

1680
01:33:31,121 --> 01:33:33,070
it has a potential grow up in it.

1681
01:33:33,071 --> 01:33:35,620
So every hundred houses
there's one house to grow up.

1682
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,180
And what is the one in seven,

1683
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:41,770
the one in seven in certain blocks in
like outer small towns of where there's

1684
01:33:41,771 --> 01:33:45,880
grow ops in these farms and it's one
in seven in those areas. Oh my God.

1685
01:33:45,881 --> 01:33:49,060
There's been small towns that they've
done articles on that literally the town

1686
01:33:49,061 --> 01:33:52,630
had nothing. Everything was dry. Then
some guys came off there, the big grow up,

1687
01:33:52,631 --> 01:33:55,240
they're paying all the guys
to do construction, good cash.

1688
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:57,880
And of course that's the whole
thing of why this union evolved.

1689
01:33:57,881 --> 01:34:01,450
Because like the guys building the shed
or the electrician setting up the lights,

1690
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:04,150
that's not illegal. Right? As long
as you're not stealing the power.

1691
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:07,690
So if he gets come to wire it
all and the guy's like, oh, here,

1692
01:34:07,691 --> 01:34:09,760
here's six grand cash, call
it even. Well of course,

1693
01:34:09,761 --> 01:34:13,790
even the electricians like sweet not
thinking to declare all that, right.

1694
01:34:13,810 --> 01:34:18,430
So there's a like a love hate relationship
that's built around the business of

1695
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:21,340
it, right? Which we break down in the
union. I'm rattling on about that.

1696
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:25,840
It's a real strange sort of
situation because uh, it's a much,

1697
01:34:25,841 --> 01:34:28,060
much more illegal in
certain parts of America.

1698
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:31,030
Like if you had to try to run
an operation like that in Texas,

1699
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:35,050
they'll fucking get you, man. They'll
come and get you. Don't mess with Texas.

1700
01:34:35,051 --> 01:34:38,740
I lived in Texas a shame.
I fucking love Texas, man.

1701
01:34:38,741 --> 01:34:40,870
Texas is one of my favorite
places to visit. I,

1702
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:44,110
I did my first CD in Houston.

1703
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:47,650
I did my first where I lived and he
used to be my first DVD and Austin.

1704
01:34:47,651 --> 01:34:51,690
I mean I fucking love taxes,
but make no mistake about it there.

1705
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:52,570
There's some curve.

1706
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:57,110
That's a really fucking
suppressive situation that
you have there when it comes

1707
01:34:57,111 --> 01:34:58,360
to marijuana in Texas.

1708
01:34:58,390 --> 01:35:01,100
Yeah, I'll give you get
caught with medical marijuana.

1709
01:35:01,101 --> 01:35:03,500
If you're like some dude
with the prescription, you
could still get in trouble.

1710
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:03,831
They're like,

1711
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:08,030
they don't respect how you want to be
builders recommendation or of nonsense.

1712
01:35:08,031 --> 01:35:11,780
Like you got some drugs on you boy on
a year and over faggotry about your

1713
01:35:11,781 --> 01:35:15,560
fucking prescription union, you
know, prescription here in Texas.

1714
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:21,940
I in that. It's great. Meanwhile,
everybody could use some wheat if,

1715
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:26,900
if all of Texas. It's the irony of it
all is that if all of Texas had weed,

1716
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:31,250
the cops jobs we way fucking easier,
way easier.

1717
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,590
That's a fact, man. The
people would chill out.

1718
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:37,070
They would get all paranoid and shit
and they do less crime because of that.

1719
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:40,110
And then they would also just be,
you know,

1720
01:35:40,111 --> 01:35:42,750
be a little bit more sensitive to
what the fuck is actually going on.

1721
01:35:42,751 --> 01:35:45,620
And what are the repercussions of your,
your evil actions out there?

1722
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:48,590
Robbing people. Settle the
fuck down, dude. For Real.

1723
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:53,060
They've already proven that it's had a
decline in automobile accidents in places

1724
01:35:53,061 --> 01:35:56,780
where marijuana, medical
marijuana is legal. I can't,

1725
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:59,120
I can't wait to dive into the call.
Like for me,

1726
01:35:59,121 --> 01:36:00,650
I may or may not be true
because you know what,

1727
01:36:00,651 --> 01:36:05,240
I did no research on that
whatsoever. I read it on low.
That does. So I can't wait.

1728
01:36:05,241 --> 01:36:06,074
Caution,

1729
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:12,420
a study done by Dr Rogan
absolutely doesn't mean that
I'm endorsing smoking pot

1730
01:36:12,681 --> 01:36:17,000
and drive it cause some people
can't handle life. Okay. So I'm not,

1731
01:36:17,001 --> 01:36:20,180
I would never say that everybody is
the same when it comes to tolerance of

1732
01:36:20,181 --> 01:36:24,620
aspirin. Alcohol causes, seen
it with alcohol, everything.

1733
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:27,590
You can never tell anybody to do anything
because some people can't do shit.

1734
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:29,450
But some people are binge eaters.

1735
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:33,400
You give them one little piece of sugary
something and they'll go crazy and you,

1736
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:35,150
it's a veracious thing.

1737
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:39,650
I've watched people polished down like
ice cream Sundaes that she shouldn't have

1738
01:36:39,651 --> 01:36:43,070
had an ice cream Sundae. And it's
like, wow, like it's our gas make.

1739
01:36:43,071 --> 01:36:47,510
Like this guy is like fulfilling some
just deep hole inside of them with this.

1740
01:36:47,511 --> 01:36:51,170
This is like sexual,
almost like he's fucking this ice cream.

1741
01:36:51,171 --> 01:36:54,350
You know what I mean? Well it's tough
like when you look at junk, like I wish,

1742
01:36:54,351 --> 01:36:55,760
you know,
when you go look at some of that for me,

1743
01:36:55,761 --> 01:36:59,790
I'm a pastry guy cause my grandmother
was Italian. Right. So like I,

1744
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:02,840
when I see that stuff I'm like, oh, I
can just eat a tray of it. Right? Like,

1745
01:37:02,841 --> 01:37:07,340
and then it's like, what is your shit?
Do you like, um, all those, the polio,

1746
01:37:07,341 --> 01:37:10,550
Ian's man, you know, the three
layers with the chocolate top.

1747
01:37:10,551 --> 01:37:13,490
That was one of my favorite from
my grandmother. Oh, those were my,

1748
01:37:13,491 --> 01:37:16,550
I just called them the three layer cookie.
Those I used to eat those things.

1749
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:20,210
So that was the only time I grab him get
mad is when she'd save them for the big

1750
01:37:20,211 --> 01:37:23,670
Christmas parties and I go in and raid
them and go to lay at the tray spread for

1751
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:26,360
all the family and there'd
be like six left. All those,

1752
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:29,030
my grandmother used to make
these other ones that had like a,

1753
01:37:29,031 --> 01:37:30,230
a black licorice kid.

1754
01:37:30,231 --> 01:37:33,980
They were like a little biscuit that had
like an icing that was slightly black

1755
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:37,100
leaders that in niece or whatever
or whatever. Those are, you know,

1756
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:41,210
it's someone fucked up and forgot to
bring to the west coast when good rice

1757
01:37:41,211 --> 01:37:45,540
pudding. See I always have a bad thought
of all right. I haven't had good right.

1758
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:46,700
I lived in New York.

1759
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:50,660
We used to go to a like little
diners you'd like to eat.

1760
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:54,470
Like if I was doing standup or something,
it stopped at a diner.

1761
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:55,260
Like these little,

1762
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:59,160
they all had a cheeseburger deluxe and
the cheeseburger deluxe was usually two

1763
01:37:59,161 --> 01:38:03,090
patties and they would give you some
coleslaw with and for dessert if you want

1764
01:38:03,091 --> 01:38:05,760
it to that a little glass thing
with like that cake looks good.

1765
01:38:05,761 --> 01:38:08,700
What's that over there? You guys got
any, you got any rice pudding? Yeah,

1766
01:38:08,701 --> 01:38:09,540
we've got some rice pudding,

1767
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:13,440
rice pudding and whipped cream and
it's fucking ridiculously delicious.

1768
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:15,720
It's so good.
And he can't find it on here.

1769
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:19,680
It's real rare that you see rice pudding
were so common on the east coast. Yeah,

1770
01:38:19,681 --> 01:38:21,960
I don't, that's not, mine
has always been a pastry.

1771
01:38:21,961 --> 01:38:24,920
So my grandmother made
everything homemade, homemade
grad, homemade jam. You,

1772
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:27,930
you're healthy dude. Do you watch
what g I try now I'm getting back out.

1773
01:38:27,931 --> 01:38:31,410
I just started in the Isogenix actually
to get back in shape here. So gen x,

1774
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:35,430
it's like the protein shakes.
Scientology now? No, no, no,

1775
01:38:36,730 --> 01:38:39,310
no, no, no. It's the,
the weight loss things.

1776
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:41,970
Cause I got up to two 24
at six foot and I'm like,

1777
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,860
I'd be fighting Cain Velasquez
right now. I'm like hell. Not that.

1778
01:38:46,861 --> 01:38:49,590
Like my ideal weight that I want to get
down to just one 90 not that that would

1779
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:51,780
be much better because it'd be
Anderson Silva, but the way,

1780
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:54,390
the way I really think like that,
like who you guess what?

1781
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:55,890
You don't have to fight any of those guys.

1782
01:38:56,970 --> 01:39:00,380
The weight wouldn't matter what you see.
What I think with the Anderson is Elisa,

1783
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:02,800
just be like a a Ninja
finish, right? Like just bang.

1784
01:39:02,801 --> 01:39:04,700
You'd finish me before
I could breathe Cain,

1785
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:09,150
I just picture the savage brutalizing
before it'd be like a slam and a crunch

1786
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:12,870
and like it just never gets tired.
I'd be a mangled pretzel,

1787
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:16,290
like his dismantling of
big foot Silva was real.

1788
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:21,620
It was disturbing because everybody
knew before Cain ever came to the UFC,

1789
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,180
everybody in the know knew about this kid,

1790
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:28,140
but former Arizona state wrestler who
they were saying was tearing it up at Aki.

1791
01:39:28,141 --> 01:39:29,850
They're like, this guy is a beast. I mean,

1792
01:39:29,851 --> 01:39:33,210
I heard a bunch of guys talking about
a shale son and who is a, you know,

1793
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:37,590
pretty fucking honest with praise or
criticism when it comes to fighters. Said,

1794
01:39:37,591 --> 01:39:41,240
everybody knows the best heavyweight
in the world is Cain Velasquez.

1795
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:43,500
This is before he ever
fought Brock for the title.

1796
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:48,090
And so when he mauled Brock people that
people in the know were like, wow, yeah,

1797
01:39:48,091 --> 01:39:48,990
that guy's for real,

1798
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:52,740
which makes junior dos Santos is fight
and victory over human. The first round,

1799
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:57,630
even more staggering. Junior is such
a bad mother fucker, man. For Real.

1800
01:39:58,550 --> 01:40:02,070
It's just so exciting now with all the
great guys that are there. Like I get,

1801
01:40:02,071 --> 01:40:05,520
I could watch every weekend. I'm so
pissed off. The ream fight didn't happen.

1802
01:40:05,521 --> 01:40:05,900
I wanted to,

1803
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:08,790
that would be a really fantastic five
because that would be one of the first

1804
01:40:08,791 --> 01:40:12,000
fights where a guy wants to
stand up with him. Yeah. No,

1805
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,150
and that's where it gets really crazy
because guess what junior could take guys

1806
01:40:15,151 --> 01:40:19,920
down to man. He took, um, he took
Shane Carwyn down. Well that's a,

1807
01:40:19,921 --> 01:40:20,671
that's what I,
I,

1808
01:40:20,671 --> 01:40:23,370
it'd be interesting to see what happens
if the sand has gets taken out just

1809
01:40:23,371 --> 01:40:27,570
cause we, yeah, I know he's
trained, but I haven't seen
him yet. Yeah. You know, he's,

1810
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:32,040
he's such a fucking great athlete, man.
Junior has some amazing hand speed.

1811
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:33,300
Amazing.
It's really,

1812
01:40:33,330 --> 01:40:37,110
really going to be hard for a lot of guys
to deal with because he has, uh, he has,

1813
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:37,830
uh,

1814
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:42,830
an advantage over almost everybody when
it comes to the thing that's the easiest

1815
01:40:43,051 --> 01:40:46,380
to land, which is your hands, you know,
it's hard to kick somebody, you know,

1816
01:40:46,381 --> 01:40:49,440
it's real hard when you worried about
God's taking you down to, you know,

1817
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:52,380
it's especially hard if the
guy's a real good wrestler.

1818
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,880
It's hard to get those kicks off,
but you know,

1819
01:40:55,210 --> 01:40:58,480
when you're nervous and you're not
sure with your footing yet, you're not,

1820
01:40:58,481 --> 01:41:01,750
you don't have your timing
down yet. You're not going
to throw, we'll kick. Okay.

1821
01:41:01,751 --> 01:41:05,170
You're going to show it. If you're going
to throw a jab, you can throw a jab. Well,

1822
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:10,320
Juniors Jab is like you getting caught
in the end of a telephone pole and he

1823
01:41:10,571 --> 01:41:11,950
throws that shit perfect.

1824
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:16,120
Riding your face and he pops you a couple
of times on the chin with that shit

1825
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:19,030
and you're, you know, you're,
you're still in the fight,

1826
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:23,020
but you're significantly diminished.
I was there for the car when fight.

1827
01:41:23,021 --> 01:41:26,200
That was in Vancouver. Right. I watched
that. That was just like bang, Bang,

1828
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:29,140
like amazing. Like amazing, amazing.
Kerwin's face stayed together.

1829
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:30,430
Colin is up beast dude,

1830
01:41:30,431 --> 01:41:34,360
that guy is so fucking tough and that
if that didn't convince everybody,

1831
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:37,480
he could have quit in between rounds.
His face was smashed up.

1832
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:39,700
They could have called that fight.
They could've called that fight.

1833
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:41,890
I thought it was, I thought they
were going to call it earlier.

1834
01:41:41,891 --> 01:41:45,280
You know and he's close.
He's just so fucking tough man.

1835
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:49,810
He is just so fucking tough.
He's an animal man. He's a tough,

1836
01:41:49,811 --> 01:41:53,710
tough dude and a nice
fucking guy to Shane Collins.

1837
01:41:53,711 --> 01:41:56,200
One of the nicest people you'd ever meet.
Super friendly,

1838
01:41:56,201 --> 01:41:58,690
genuinely nice to everybody.
He meets.

1839
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:02,620
What I've heard you talk in the podcast
show, it's, it seems right to cause,

1840
01:42:02,621 --> 01:42:06,040
I mean I had a boxing background
and you know when you go in there,

1841
01:42:06,041 --> 01:42:08,140
even the best guys have
taken a lick and right.

1842
01:42:08,141 --> 01:42:11,020
And they know what that feeling's like
and to get challenged in there and you

1843
01:42:11,021 --> 01:42:14,890
can get caught on any given night that
you are more humble because you go work

1844
01:42:14,891 --> 01:42:16,210
it out and you've been through there.

1845
01:42:16,211 --> 01:42:20,950
And I like to go like I went to go try
a Jujitsu for my first time a few months

1846
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:21,850
ago and you know,

1847
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:26,110
cause I did boxing and fought and stuff
when I was younger and I wanted to,

1848
01:42:26,111 --> 01:42:27,430
I'm like I'm so enthralled by,

1849
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:30,910
I watch these young kids on youtube
now that are doing jujitsu moves and

1850
01:42:30,911 --> 01:42:31,870
slamming guys.

1851
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:34,870
Have you seen the head button knockout
of the kid on the one I've seen

1852
01:42:34,871 --> 01:42:35,180
everything.
Every

1853
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:38,750
fight that's ever been,
I've got a problem.

1854
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,190
Do a little Ninja kick UK.

1855
01:42:40,191 --> 01:42:44,690
You've seen this when the guy has a shirt
type W into my browser worldstar hip

1856
01:42:44,691 --> 01:42:47,320
hop comes up. Okay. That's
how many fights I've seen it.

1857
01:42:49,110 --> 01:42:52,940
That's the first thing. Google chrome
says all bitch, I know where you're going.

1858
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,860
What's your first Twitter?
Cause mine's like,

1859
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,950
for some reason it's like something
I used to tweet a long time ago,

1860
01:42:57,951 --> 01:43:00,290
but I haven't been on
that for a long time.

1861
01:43:00,291 --> 01:43:03,680
But for some reason that's
always the first one. If I
hit t, it comes up Twitter.

1862
01:43:03,690 --> 01:43:07,130
But it's like backslash something I
don't, I shouldn't. Oh really? So like,

1863
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,900
like it'll come up like weird.
Like a,

1864
01:43:08,901 --> 01:43:11,140
a page that you'd never
visited before who had no, I,

1865
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:13,580
that early visit I used
to visit all the time.

1866
01:43:13,581 --> 01:43:16,580
And Ex girlfriends happens sometimes,
right? Yeah, it's an ex girlfriend and,

1867
01:43:16,581 --> 01:43:20,030
but so, but every time I pressed tea,
it's the first one that comes up. Jesus.

1868
01:43:20,330 --> 01:43:21,770
Because you're,
you're a stalker.

1869
01:43:21,771 --> 01:43:24,900
You don't realize it in the backyard with
the cloud. I think it's in the cloud.

1870
01:43:24,901 --> 01:43:27,080
And you know what I mean? It's cause I
used safari or something. I don't know.

1871
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:30,390
Oh yeah. Probably just
safari take it's, um,

1872
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:34,280
cookies from the cloud to
know, fuck knows. I don't know.

1873
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:38,120
I don't understand that. You
can ask me, don't ask me this.

1874
01:43:38,121 --> 01:43:38,954
Is this what we gotta do?

1875
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:42,740
You gotta all be nice to each
other cause we're getting absorbed.

1876
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:44,330
We're all going to be one thing.

1877
01:43:44,331 --> 01:43:47,030
It's happening saboteur right
now and we've got to learn.

1878
01:43:47,031 --> 01:43:50,180
It'd be nice to each other.
Learn to do your fucking part here.

1879
01:43:50,181 --> 01:43:52,490
Pull your own goddamn weights

1880
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:55,100
because we are one crazy thing and that's,

1881
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:58,550
that shit is slowly being
brought to light technologically.

1882
01:43:58,690 --> 01:44:02,590
Oh Man. Look at the connect. Funny story
today. Not maybe I just fucking got high.

1883
01:44:02,591 --> 01:44:05,710
I made that shit up and
it's why I got all excited.

1884
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:09,670
I think I was on getting on the
plane today from Vancouver. Um,

1885
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:13,360
what's her name? Uh, she was
Kelly Taylor and nine oh two.

1886
01:44:13,361 --> 01:44:18,361
I know the Blonde Janine Garth or Jenny
Garden Jennie Garth has looking at was

1887
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:22,030
like, I think that's her.
And then I looked and I went
online. Right. And I'm like,

1888
01:44:22,031 --> 01:44:24,250
what does she look like now? And
while my phone, I'm right. Okay.

1889
01:44:24,251 --> 01:44:25,084
And I look and then,

1890
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:28,030
and then I saw on her Twitter it said
that she just wrapped filming a movie in

1891
01:44:28,031 --> 01:44:32,590
Canada. So I was like, okay, that's her.
So then I said, oh, I tweeted like, oh,

1892
01:44:32,591 --> 01:44:36,070
it's like I'm in,
I'm in a Yvr and I see this blonde.

1893
01:44:36,071 --> 01:44:38,440
I think I know I looks familiar
and to find out it's her. Oh,

1894
01:44:38,441 --> 01:44:42,730
she still looks beautiful for her age
and then, oh, I just say the age part,

1895
01:44:42,731 --> 01:44:45,010
you could have got it. So no, I
didn't say age. I just said beautiful.

1896
01:44:45,190 --> 01:44:47,440
Actually I just said beautiful.
It's, it's still looks beautiful.

1897
01:44:47,441 --> 01:44:51,040
No age didn't fit. You can check
my Twitter, but yeah, no, no,

1898
01:44:51,041 --> 01:44:54,840
because I tweeted her in and then she
tweeted mother fucker them yet. No,

1899
01:44:54,850 --> 01:44:57,490
you can check it's there forever. I
believe you. I believe you. Right.

1900
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:02,410
Fuck my own quotes up all the time.
And then she yet, but then I see our,

1901
01:45:02,411 --> 01:45:04,450
I had put her in it and then she was like,
Oh hey,

1902
01:45:04,451 --> 01:45:07,300
you must have been on my
flight. Huh. Thank you. Like,

1903
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:09,120
and I was thinking about that
like weird. Like, you know,

1904
01:45:09,121 --> 01:45:12,070
you never had that connectivity
like right there, you know, if you,

1905
01:45:12,071 --> 01:45:15,530
you may contact with a star if you were
a big fan of nine oh two oh that would,

1906
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:18,730
could have made your year just by
going through. Have you followed up

1907
01:45:23,370 --> 01:45:27,310
freak you out man. Married
two kids. There's not feel
like you. Of course you are.

1908
01:45:27,311 --> 01:45:31,640
We're just chugging along with going
to the olive garden. For some reason I

1909
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:34,810
felt like she had a talk show
that maybe I was going to be on.

1910
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:37,480
I don't know if I did it,
but I did.

1911
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:41,470
The Donny and Marie show does get a lot
of shows. Man. When I was on news radio,

1912
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:45,880
we would do as many shows that they
would ask us to do because our show was,

1913
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:47,920
you know,
not doing that well in the ratings.

1914
01:45:48,130 --> 01:45:50,500
So I wound up doing the Donny
and Marie show. I did it twice.

1915
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:55,600
I did it with the chastity Bono before
she became chiles. Really? Yeah.

1916
01:45:56,470 --> 01:46:00,250
Then I'd love to hear stories like what's
up before, after which one felt best.

1917
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:03,910
I didn't see her. I never met her
after, but it was fascinating.

1918
01:46:03,911 --> 01:46:08,911
It was listening to him now
talk about the effect that uh,

1919
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:14,410
turning hormonally into a man has had
on what he likes and doesn't like.

1920
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:17,170
It was really interesting.
Yeah, really fascinating.

1921
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:22,180
And that mindless babble became
incredibly irritating to him,

1922
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:26,640
whereas he enjoyed it when he was female,
but as,

1923
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:30,810
as he made the, so it's not
just to stereotype, you're
saying, oh, what's C'mon man.

1924
01:46:30,811 --> 01:46:32,460
It's to, it's silly. It's real.

1925
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:37,600
It's real clear in almost all primate
cultures that men and women are different.

1926
01:46:37,770 --> 01:46:40,990
You know? It's just you've got to
accept whoever the fuck we are.

1927
01:46:40,991 --> 01:46:44,590
Just don't try to change each other
except the fact that we're absolutely

1928
01:46:44,591 --> 01:46:48,940
completely different things and just be
nice to each other. That's not always,

1929
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:50,063
it's fucking hard.

1930
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:54,780
That's the hard thing. It's like you're
aware. We have to admit, first of all,

1931
01:46:54,781 --> 01:46:55,740
we're in a corrupt system,

1932
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:59,130
so we have to figure out how to fix that
without arresting every single fucking

1933
01:46:59,131 --> 01:46:59,671
he would bang.

1934
01:46:59,671 --> 01:47:04,590
It's in power in every facet of government
that could be responsible and corrupt.

1935
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:08,340
We have to figure out a way to
make this system make more sense.

1936
01:47:08,341 --> 01:47:10,050
Like this is not like
the right kind of system.

1937
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,680
Like this seems like too complicated, this
whole representative government thing.

1938
01:47:13,681 --> 01:47:17,430
I mean, I don't know how you guys rock
it up in Canada. How you, uh, you know,

1939
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:21,090
how you feel about a special interest
groups. I mean, do you have this? No,

1940
01:47:21,091 --> 01:47:23,910
you can't. You can't, uh, uh,

1941
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:28,170
in politics in Canada you can't have big
business give them money like they can

1942
01:47:28,171 --> 01:47:30,030
in the US,
you can't do that.

1943
01:47:30,031 --> 01:47:32,640
It's like the maximum they can
take from one company is like,

1944
01:47:32,670 --> 01:47:35,510
I don't know the numbers correctly,
so if I get ugly, but it's,

1945
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:39,320
it's not very much don't make a mother
fucker moved to Canada do because it just

1946
01:47:39,321 --> 01:47:43,430
keeps, I know you're kind of,
then you bring it up. It's
the best country, man. It's,

1947
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:47,490
I, I, when I go there, I always tell
people it's like 20% less douche bags.

1948
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:51,650
So like I never understand why people
can't be that cool in America. You know,

1949
01:47:51,651 --> 01:47:52,110
what era?

1950
01:47:52,110 --> 01:47:56,040
One of the big differences I see like now
like living in the u s and then coming

1951
01:47:56,041 --> 01:48:00,980
here is there seems to be a bit more
care in Catholic. I hear lots in the US.

1952
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,640
It's like, well, if he didn't
make it, well fuck him,

1953
01:48:02,641 --> 01:48:05,520
it's years and it's my right and you
know what? Instead of being like, yeah,

1954
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:09,870
but if everybody's not doing well and
your name, you're like fuck your neighbor.

1955
01:48:09,871 --> 01:48:12,780
Well you know, if you run out of power
and shit hits the fan, they need help.

1956
01:48:12,781 --> 01:48:14,820
Well is it going to be fuck your neighbor
then no one's gonna be like, Hey,

1957
01:48:14,821 --> 01:48:18,180
can we help each other out soon?
Man, ambition is very good.

1958
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:22,830
But ambition without compassion is empty.
It's nonsense.

1959
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:25,170
That's ridiculous.
That's like not,

1960
01:48:25,171 --> 01:48:29,700
that's not the proper use of your
karmic resources because you know,

1961
01:48:29,701 --> 01:48:31,830
you gotta,
you gotta have like a nice community.

1962
01:48:31,831 --> 01:48:33,540
You got to be happy when you know,

1963
01:48:33,541 --> 01:48:37,020
when you're doing well and when he's
doing well and everybody enjoys each

1964
01:48:37,021 --> 01:48:40,590
other's company and that's why you,
you know, you create a community.

1965
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,530
That's the whole idea is
that we could all do that.

1966
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:48,460
If we accepted every one of us as if
it was us leading another life. It's,

1967
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:51,760
you know all that shit. That's why we do
legal man. Start thinking like that. Joe,

1968
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:52,190
we'll start.

1969
01:48:52,190 --> 01:48:55,290
I'll tell you from listening to your
guys' show from the beginning and seeing

1970
01:48:55,291 --> 01:48:56,760
what you guys have built up,
you and Brian,

1971
01:48:56,761 --> 01:49:00,000
I mean this amazing community
that supports each other.

1972
01:49:00,001 --> 01:49:03,570
The other comedians when people are on
you let them pull plugs for their stuff

1973
01:49:03,571 --> 01:49:06,270
like and it just,
you see how well you guys are doing.

1974
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:10,740
I've seen when you guys had your first
one it was snowy screen and now in the

1975
01:49:10,741 --> 01:49:13,340
kind of people like I
genuinely look forward.

1976
01:49:13,341 --> 01:49:16,050
It's like when you had Ricky Ross on here.
Yeah he was talking to us.

1977
01:49:16,051 --> 01:49:20,490
It was fascinating and like I can't
wait to see Graham Hancock. You old man.

1978
01:49:20,491 --> 01:49:23,220
That's one of my favorite one 42 I
know it off by heart. I'm always like,

1979
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:25,530
oh how dare you crazy.

1980
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:29,880
Have you been paying attention to this
object and the bottom of the ball? Got It.

1981
01:49:29,881 --> 01:49:32,130
Cause of you, right. I
fall through like your,

1982
01:49:32,131 --> 01:49:34,900
your tweets are the ones I
looked at by most of portal, sir,

1983
01:49:34,901 --> 01:49:37,230
because people deliver it to me first.
I just,

1984
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:40,050
they know if they send me something
weird, it gets out there. But that's,

1985
01:49:40,051 --> 01:49:42,120
I mean through your podcast
so people know, right?

1986
01:49:42,121 --> 01:49:45,270
They know that you're doing that kind
of stuff. It's the power that you have.

1987
01:49:45,271 --> 01:49:48,910
I mean, even just the first couple times
you retweeted me when I was building my

1988
01:49:48,911 --> 01:49:52,190
Twitter's like up a couple
thousand followers. It's like boom,

1989
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:55,120
that people are like, oh, it's a union guy
eating. And then it goes, that's awesome.

1990
01:49:55,670 --> 01:49:58,330
Take the first time you retweeted me
cause I'm like, check out this article.

1991
01:49:58,331 --> 01:50:00,590
And you're like, yeah, it's retreat and
my phone all day. It was like, Dang.

1992
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:03,760
I was like, what's wrong?
I'm like, Twitter. That's
when I finally got into it,

1993
01:50:03,761 --> 01:50:06,140
I was like, oh, I see how this works
now. And started going through.

1994
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:09,610
You can create a little community.
Like, I mean for the most part,

1995
01:50:09,611 --> 01:50:13,150
and this is not bullshit and almost
all the tweets I get are positive.

1996
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:16,680
You do get a lot of positive.
They're really nice people and you,

1997
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:18,670
you sort of can kind of cultivate that.
I mean,

1998
01:50:18,671 --> 01:50:21,440
you're going to run across the
occasional, yeah, well we, we,

1999
01:50:21,441 --> 01:50:25,390
we ageable grumpy pants on a smaller
level. We did that for the union. I mean,

2000
01:50:25,391 --> 01:50:25,781
we got,

2001
01:50:25,781 --> 01:50:29,000
we built this Facebook page with no money
or anything like the studios have the,

2002
01:50:29,001 --> 01:50:32,200
has like 40,000 people that follow
it. That's nice. And you know,

2003
01:50:32,201 --> 01:50:36,580
they always like when you know, right now
we're doing, there's a real mean to it.

2004
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,200
Oh,
excuse me.

2005
01:50:38,201 --> 01:50:41,950
Are you should fear it's going out dressed
like a crazy person just walking in

2006
01:50:41,951 --> 01:50:45,490
on a podcast. What's up brother?
Come have a seat, man. Jump in.

2007
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,270
Don't Hawaii Buddy came out.
What the hell is up?

2008
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:51,760
But [inaudible] ladies and gentlemen,
I went, the hell is that my man,

2009
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:56,560
my man or we met in Vancouver.
All right. Hey, what's up dude?

2010
01:50:56,810 --> 01:51:00,700
We this podcast over what the fuck's
going on? Yeah, well it's nine 15. Yeah,

2011
01:51:00,701 --> 01:51:04,600
we usually start at nine 30. Okay,
that's cool. Let's, uh, all right.

2012
01:51:04,601 --> 01:51:08,600
Sit down and join us, man. So you have
a Kickstarter for your new film? Yeah.

2013
01:51:08,690 --> 01:51:13,690
Just the culture high and they can find
it at [inaudible] calm and a is this

2014
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:17,470
trailer worth checking out?
Yeah, the trailer is really
good. We worked hard on it.

2015
01:51:17,530 --> 01:51:19,140
How could you say, is it
worth checking out? Oh,

2016
01:51:19,150 --> 01:51:23,110
I didn't know if it was like a very
long and you know [inaudible] like four

2017
01:51:23,111 --> 01:51:25,210
minutes, right? Silly.

2018
01:51:25,550 --> 01:51:26,383
Yeah.

2019
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:29,873
Thank you.

2020
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:45,740
It is a system which has conscripted vast
human and material resources into the

2021
01:51:47,131 --> 01:51:48,360
building of a tightly knit,

2022
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:52,680
highly efficient machine
that combines military,

2023
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:56,220
diplomatic intelligence,
economic,

2024
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:58,860
scientific and political operations.

2025
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:04,530
Its preparations are concealed,
not published. Mistakes are buried,

2026
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:09,360
not headlined. It's to set
as a silenced, not praised.

2027
01:52:10,050 --> 01:52:15,030
No expenditure is question. No rumor
is printed. No secret is revealed.

2028
01:52:18,890 --> 01:52:23,690
In 2007 a small independent documentary
on bailing the breakdown of marijuana

2029
01:52:23,691 --> 01:52:27,990
prohibition entered the North American
Film Festival circuit. The unit,

2030
01:52:28,190 --> 01:52:31,820
the business behind getting high
would find itself accepted into 33

2031
01:52:31,821 --> 01:52:34,070
international film festivals.
In the span of a year.

2032
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:38,570
The film went on to win numerous awards
in Gardner critical acclaim across the

2033
01:52:38,571 --> 01:52:41,780
globe with little to no
support from big studios.

2034
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:46,760
That union stormed the Internet realm
reaching out to millions of witnessing

2035
01:52:46,761 --> 01:52:48,170
this overwhelming response.

2036
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:51,920
The filmmakers took it upon themselves
to evolve the documentary from a simple

2037
01:52:51,921 --> 01:52:54,470
motion picture into the
beginnings of a movement.

2038
01:52:55,430 --> 01:53:00,350
And so the union social networking
Facebook page was worn quickly growing to

2039
01:53:00,351 --> 01:53:05,351
serve over 35,000 active users arm with
groundbreaking numbers on with many had

2040
01:53:06,081 --> 01:53:07,430
said to be a dead topic.

2041
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:12,580
Distributors and broadcasters were
forced to take notice five years after

2042
01:53:12,621 --> 01:53:16,670
conception that you need in the issue of
cannabis prohibition was launched into

2043
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:19,750
the mainstream.
As the film is released into video stores,

2044
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:24,790
universities and media outlets across
the world with new found exposure at the

2045
01:53:24,831 --> 01:53:28,670
film went on to claim the attention of
Canada's highest level of government as

2046
01:53:28,671 --> 01:53:32,420
it was chosen to be screened on Parliament
Hill in order to educate senators and

2047
01:53:32,421 --> 01:53:32,940
members

2048
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:35,670
parliament on the ramifications
in marijuana prohibition.

2049
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:38,370
The rest is history.

2050
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,290
Now in the twilight of a
public shift of awareness,

2051
01:53:43,410 --> 01:53:47,580
the unions makers have set into motion
plans to create what they hope to be the

2052
01:53:47,581 --> 01:53:50,740
most prolific and relevant
marijuana documentary. To date,

2053
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:54,610
the followup film to the Union
entitled the Culture High.

2054
01:53:55,390 --> 01:53:59,620
Having had six years to grow to
adopt new stories, new heroes,

2055
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:00,610
new villains,

2056
01:54:00,730 --> 01:54:04,810
and an entirely evolved insight and
just society and who we are as a human

2057
01:54:04,811 --> 01:54:06,430
species.
The culture high,

2058
01:54:06,431 --> 01:54:10,000
we'll break down the boundaries that
prevent marijuana prohibition from being

2059
01:54:10,001 --> 01:54:11,620
stripped down to its very core.

2060
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:16,780
Are we at least effective when lost in
the emotion of group mentality as the

2061
01:54:16,781 --> 01:54:19,630
emergence of the Internet equalize
that political playing field,

2062
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:21,161
the culture high,

2063
01:54:21,161 --> 01:54:25,000
we'll raise the stakes with some of
today's biggest celebrities gain access to

2064
01:54:25,001 --> 01:54:27,690
previously unattainable
footage and revealing

2065
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:30,610
incredibly moving testimonies
from both sides of the spectrum,

2066
01:54:31,190 --> 01:54:34,900
the culture high as the documentary that
will tear into the very fiber of the

2067
01:54:34,901 --> 01:54:36,570
longest fought war more time.

2068
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:43,610
But in order to make this documentary
come to fruition, we need your support.

2069
01:54:44,150 --> 01:54:48,890
By August 1st we must raise $190,000
to kickstart the remaining funding

2070
01:54:48,891 --> 01:54:50,660
necessary to produce this film.

2071
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:55,940
What we seek from you is not charity but
the pre pledge support of your copy of

2072
01:54:55,941 --> 01:54:57,770
the film.
It's that simple.

2073
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:03,100
You prepurchase your DVD copy of the
culture high for $35 and by doing so you

2074
01:55:03,441 --> 01:55:06,530
will give the film the ability
to be made in the first place.

2075
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,630
That's brilliant equation.
Then you pretty bad.

2076
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:12,910
The film started saying it alone is like

2077
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,730
the way to go for it
for all these projects.

2078
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:20,050
This is a great way to do it because you
have a great track record. Like I said,

2079
01:55:20,051 --> 01:55:23,890
your first piece, if you haven't seen it,
folks go out and get it and if you can,

2080
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:27,340
if you're not, if you're not
fucking starving, please pay for it.

2081
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:31,630
Cause a Adam's good dude and it's a
really well done piece and it took a long

2082
01:55:31,631 --> 01:55:35,880
time. I know you, it was a labor
of love for a long time. You know,

2083
01:55:35,890 --> 01:55:36,850
I never thought about it,
man.

2084
01:55:36,851 --> 01:55:40,300
We did it and then it was a while after
that before it actually got released.

2085
01:55:40,301 --> 01:55:43,890
Like how long was it? Two years. We
are done in 2007 but it didn't come out

2086
01:55:44,330 --> 01:55:47,580
till 2009 because we couldn't
get a distribution deal.
We didn't know how. Right.

2087
01:55:47,581 --> 01:55:50,430
It was our first time.
Now this time with the culture high,

2088
01:55:50,431 --> 01:55:54,090
we already have a theatrical deal in
place where we have to pay for it.

2089
01:55:54,091 --> 01:55:57,420
That's what the gap and you're going
to be in the movie movies? Yeah. Yeah.

2090
01:55:57,421 --> 01:55:59,580
Like in America or
Canada? No, no. America.

2091
01:55:59,581 --> 01:56:04,080
We feel phase four films that picked
up Kevin Smith's red state. So Ocean,

2092
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:08,070
Abraham, Lincoln, vampire
hunter. You could go see the
culture, how you won't get,

2093
01:56:08,071 --> 01:56:11,250
we'll get only two days unless it
sells out and then it will stay a week.

2094
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:14,670
But are you going to be able to go to
like those mainstream cinemas that like

2095
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:15,181
play?

2096
01:56:15,181 --> 01:56:18,900
Will they distribute like it'll be with
like say whoever it's AMC or whatever

2097
01:56:18,901 --> 01:56:22,050
and then they'll pick their certain
locations. Does that work though? I mean,

2098
01:56:22,051 --> 01:56:26,790
if you have a crazy
controversial documentary like
dark, does that get censored?

2099
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:28,180
Nope.
Doesn't get censored.

2100
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:30,580
I mean without the hard part
is getting your money's worth.

2101
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:33,310
I'm saying does it get
it censored? Um, it,

2102
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:36,930
does it keep you from being in
certain like malls? Oh definitely.

2103
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,690
There's a certain countries that wouldn't
even touch my thing because of its

2104
01:56:39,691 --> 01:56:43,770
subject. Certain territories are just
like, no, it's about that and Canada. No,

2105
01:56:43,771 --> 01:56:46,800
not in Canada but in certain like there's
certain markets like it would never be

2106
01:56:46,801 --> 01:56:48,930
on Air Canada's flights. Right. I saw you.

2107
01:56:48,931 --> 01:56:52,410
I wasn't sure if you said counties or
countries. No, countries and territories.

2108
01:56:52,411 --> 01:56:54,210
Right.
Like if you sell certain parts of Europe,

2109
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:56,610
that's where I saw when the
distribution game, I'm like wow,

2110
01:56:56,611 --> 01:56:59,730
so they're going to be certain types of
films that just don't get out there so

2111
01:56:59,731 --> 01:57:02,640
that culture won't see it. Like they
know if it's an action or whatever.

2112
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:04,860
Certain ones they just not allowed.
They won't certainly was like,

2113
01:57:04,861 --> 01:57:05,611
don't even tell me that.

2114
01:57:05,611 --> 01:57:10,611
I'm looking at it in like an
AMC multiplex cinema in America.

2115
01:57:11,190 --> 01:57:14,470
Yes. All the regular movies like
the Avengers and right next to her,

2116
01:57:14,471 --> 01:57:17,580
the colors might be one of the small,
like say there's two MC GMCS,

2117
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:20,790
it'll probably be the smaller one and
one and one of them smells like feet and

2118
01:57:20,791 --> 01:57:22,590
that's the one.
Yeah,

2119
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:27,630
all those fuck hill for a
doc that's so hard to do. So,

2120
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:31,080
but if you do them like this,
we're like what you guys have done,

2121
01:57:31,081 --> 01:57:34,380
where you build this community
that follows and you make
sure that the few dates

2122
01:57:34,381 --> 01:57:37,620
that they come out are targeted in
targeted areas and the people go see them,

2123
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:39,690
then it makes sense.
Well you know,

2124
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:43,230
this is also a community that would
want to support something like this.

2125
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:46,540
So you know them being able to see
that video and say, hey man, I would,

2126
01:57:46,650 --> 01:57:50,760
I would love to get a copy of that and
you know, have the pride and the, it's a,

2127
01:57:50,761 --> 01:57:52,440
it's a nice feeling to know that you know,

2128
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:55,950
you purchased something that you actually
want and you allow something to get

2129
01:57:55,951 --> 01:57:59,850
made because of the fact that he purchased
it in advance. You gave like, you know,

2130
01:57:59,851 --> 01:58:04,830
a, a vote of trust that just, you know,
I mean, you're an honorable man. It's,

2131
01:58:04,831 --> 01:58:07,470
it's a, it's a worthy investment. I know
you're going to put out a good product,

2132
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:11,520
so it's cool the way you're doing it.
I like it. I like it. You know, it's a,

2133
01:58:11,521 --> 01:58:13,950
it's a good sentiment. Well,
in our first eight days,

2134
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:18,450
we've raised 58,000 bucks and the
town days. That's amazing. Oh,

2135
01:58:18,451 --> 01:58:21,900
this support has been phenomenal.
Like even, it shocked everyone.

2136
01:58:21,901 --> 01:58:25,080
Even Todd was like, dude, he's
like everybody in the marijuana.

2137
01:58:25,081 --> 01:58:29,160
How much do you need to make total
one 91 90 and you're already a,

2138
01:58:29,190 --> 01:58:33,240
we've got 35 days to go. We're 50
almost 57,000 there it is right there.

2139
01:58:33,241 --> 01:58:35,880
You have an arbitrary number of
days to go on. This thing is,

2140
01:58:35,881 --> 01:58:36,900
I wouldn't start or makes it,

2141
01:58:36,901 --> 01:58:40,200
you have to do it because then you can
just always be kind of accepting money

2142
01:58:40,201 --> 01:58:42,200
from. Right, right. And then it's

2143
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:44,520
all or nothing. Right. We have
to hit the whole goal. Right?

2144
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:47,830
Or are we getting nothing? When you
get the one I didn't. You stop. Pardon?

2145
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:50,740
When you get to one nine d no,
you can go over, which is great.

2146
01:58:50,741 --> 01:58:53,330
If we go over then we can put
it into more theaters. Right.

2147
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:56,020
Their laws now on begging
for money on the Internet.

2148
01:58:57,150 --> 01:59:01,040
Do they have like very specific laws?
Like you're not allowed to, you know,

2149
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:04,120
to fuck people over too much.
I ask him for money on the Internet.

2150
01:59:04,121 --> 01:59:07,930
Probably can't do fraud people for one
thing and then just go to go to Vegas.

2151
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:10,150
You can't probably the fraud.

2152
01:59:10,330 --> 01:59:13,300
Well that's the thing is kickstart as a
good way that they have to approve your

2153
01:59:13,301 --> 01:59:16,030
project and improving. You don't
just get to put it up there. Well,

2154
01:59:16,031 --> 01:59:19,420
you could also make a kickstart though.
Fund my lifestyle for a year.

2155
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:22,300
I want to live. If you did a good
enough video and people want it to do,

2156
01:59:22,490 --> 01:59:23,920
there's not just for docs.

2157
01:59:23,921 --> 01:59:27,580
There's people that are creating like
video games or they have a new watch and

2158
01:59:27,581 --> 01:59:29,350
you pre buy the watch when you get it.

2159
01:59:29,351 --> 01:59:32,770
Or I have a kickstart to make a new
Kickstarter type kind of website.

2160
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:38,140
How long before, how you, how dare you,
how long before these Google lenses,

2161
01:59:38,141 --> 01:59:42,250
these Google goggles will
be a subscription service
where you can pay to look

2162
01:59:42,251 --> 01:59:44,050
through someone's eyes.
Hopefully soon.

2163
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:46,420
That's going to have
technology keeps happening.

2164
01:59:46,421 --> 01:59:49,450
How much would it be worth to look
through Tom Cruise's eyes for a day?

2165
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:54,480
I would pay $1,000 you know some celebrity
with sell that for sure this is a gay

2166
01:59:55,421 --> 01:59:58,480
porn cause I would take a chance,
take a chance.

2167
01:59:58,481 --> 02:00:02,830
At the day I tune is a day he decided to
just break his fast and suck her cock.

2168
02:00:04,690 --> 02:00:07,810
I would do, would it be nice
if he could just come out?

2169
02:00:08,710 --> 02:00:11,530
Wouldn't it be beautiful? That's
what I love to be. Think he's gay.

2170
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:13,540
I'll bore at made funny when he was like,
oh,

2171
02:00:13,541 --> 02:00:16,510
I realized all these major
guys are straight. Right.

2172
02:00:16,511 --> 02:00:20,710
And it showed guys that clearly have
reputations for plus. So weird man,

2173
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:22,180
I'm going to rock.
Hudson was gay.

2174
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:25,990
It was like devastating to people and
then afterwards it was like, oh yeah,

2175
02:00:25,991 --> 02:00:28,450
of course.
Tell you if Tom Cruise is not gay,

2176
02:00:28,451 --> 02:00:33,160
that he is the victim of the worst
fucking horrendous smear campaign ever.

2177
02:00:33,490 --> 02:00:36,520
Him and Travolta. You've just become
a part of that. Yeah, it's so, well,

2178
02:00:36,521 --> 02:00:40,000
I'm denying that part right now and
I'm apologizing for my ignorance.

2179
02:00:40,510 --> 02:00:44,410
How do I know what the fuck he does a
great joke about it, about Travolta,

2180
02:00:44,411 --> 02:00:46,960
reaching out and grabbing that guy's cock.
What he says,

2181
02:00:46,961 --> 02:00:49,350
he fondled his balls because
at first he touched my ball.

2182
02:00:49,930 --> 02:00:54,290
Then he reached out and grabbed
my name and then what do
you tap? No, no, no, no, no,

2183
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:58,010
no, no. And then minutes later,
yeah, that's what he said.

2184
02:00:58,011 --> 02:01:00,220
And then minutes later and then
it's the fuck you talking about.

2185
02:01:00,221 --> 02:01:02,310
Minutes later you're still in the room.
You asshole.

2186
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:05,770
Can I just grab your Dick
Norton was on the last podcast.

2187
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:08,350
He was fucking amazing to
listen to what he said it was.

2188
02:01:08,620 --> 02:01:11,680
I'm so happy that Norton exists.
He's one of those guys.

2189
02:01:11,681 --> 02:01:13,060
I'm so happy there's a Norton.

2190
02:01:13,061 --> 02:01:17,410
He was so funny when he was going over
his different perversions. I was crying,

2191
02:01:17,411 --> 02:01:20,170
laughing.
He's so entertaining to me.

2192
02:01:20,171 --> 02:01:22,820
Like the way he's so honest
about it and a blood,

2193
02:01:22,830 --> 02:01:24,670
the way he like relish isn't like you're,

2194
02:01:24,671 --> 02:01:26,770
you're getting to experience
it through him. You know,

2195
02:01:26,771 --> 02:01:30,220
like how he liked girls as it just a
little stinky. Just a little, not at,

2196
02:01:30,221 --> 02:01:33,340
not a terrible smell. Just a little smell.
A little smell. I like a little smell.

2197
02:01:33,590 --> 02:01:36,540
He was like, he's so funny. I
like, I like underarms. He like,

2198
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:40,370
he likes a little feet smell. He likes
when girl's feet smell a little bit.

2199
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:45,470
Love Adrian. He's a crazy
guy, man. I love him.

2200
02:01:45,570 --> 02:01:48,500
It's so nice that there's a
guy like Jim Norton, you know?

2201
02:01:48,501 --> 02:01:51,800
Where would you be without comedians?
Harsh. A female comedians. Yeah.

2202
02:01:51,801 --> 02:01:55,430
If you were forced to hang
out with the average folk, oh,

2203
02:01:56,860 --> 02:01:59,240
you know, if you didn't have a
guy like Jim Norton and your life,

2204
02:01:59,241 --> 02:02:03,050
if I have a guy like Joey
d s and your life, or, uh,

2205
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:07,220
I don't know, I would just be
bored. You really ever stopped.

2206
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:10,010
I realized this recently. I've talked to
this yesterday. I think what it was like,

2207
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:12,650
I don't really have any friends
that aren't comedians. Wow.

2208
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:16,040
I gotta to make some friend friends.
I've Jujitsu friends.

2209
02:02:16,210 --> 02:02:19,070
I have a quite a few friends that aren't
comedians and I hang out with them or

2210
02:02:19,071 --> 02:02:20,970
just attribute to oh well attributes.
Well,

2211
02:02:20,990 --> 02:02:25,210
some of them are hanging out with them
and then uh, I have uh, some um, uh,

2212
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:30,180
pool friends put it just the fuck is I
though. Oh, the Nazi's looking at you man.

2213
02:02:30,181 --> 02:02:34,280
I'd see Nazi zombies zoned
in on our Jewish friends. Oh,

2214
02:02:34,281 --> 02:02:37,400
you should fear how rude with the Nazis.
Zombie.

2215
02:02:38,590 --> 02:02:43,190
This is creepy man.
Imagine if that shit was real life.

2216
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:45,680
Imagine if that was what you had
to deal with out in the streets.

2217
02:02:46,660 --> 02:02:49,430
Just this Nazi zombies. It's fucking
Nazi zombies everywhere, man.

2218
02:02:49,431 --> 02:02:53,360
Trying to eat you. We're so lucky.
We're so soft to grow or where we go.

2219
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:57,620
We just drive around in our cars
listening to satellite radio complaint

2220
02:02:57,621 --> 02:03:01,570
complaint. If our Internet is not
fast enough on her phone, whoa.

2221
02:03:02,150 --> 02:03:04,820
We could be living in that.
That movie.

2222
02:03:04,970 --> 02:03:08,040
What's that TV show where
the walking dead. Oh, dead.

2223
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:10,670
That could be real man as it could
have happened 10 minutes ago.

2224
02:03:10,671 --> 02:03:14,360
We just don't know it yet. They keep
seeing, you know, do you know, I'm sorry?

2225
02:03:14,361 --> 02:03:17,270
Do you know him? Yeah, we met once
at a restaurant. Vancouver. Okay.

2226
02:03:17,330 --> 02:03:20,510
When you guys feed Yack, Yack at that
time. Yeah. That place is awesome.

2227
02:03:20,511 --> 02:03:24,860
What did she call it now? They need just
to sell it the fuck out. It's great.

2228
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:30,170
It's called comedy mix. What happened to
your heart's fear? Pummeled that place.

2229
02:03:30,650 --> 02:03:33,950
You have a chaplain? She's looking
sexy. Always feels looking sexy.

2230
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:36,800
That's what happened. Zombie
Hitler here. That's what happened.

2231
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:43,460
The fabulous are we should fear. You're
fabulous. It's fuck dude, look at you.

2232
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:47,540
You're rocking it. I love it. I
like what you doing? It's perfect.

2233
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:51,460
Just go straight to nothing. I'm not
fucking around for three days. Yeah.

2234
02:03:51,730 --> 02:03:54,950
Do we need to hang out at Starbucks
and just sit there and read?

2235
02:03:54,980 --> 02:03:58,670
Have you been doing some road gigs,
man? Yeah, I'm going to Ottawa.

2236
02:03:58,671 --> 02:04:02,970
Where that you just showed in your,
uh, your documentary. I'll be nice.

2237
02:04:03,030 --> 02:04:04,830
It's beautiful.
Then in the summer and get harsh.

2238
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:09,850
Fear will also be with me and
Duncan Trussell in Calgary
and I think that is was

2239
02:04:10,101 --> 02:04:11,690
that July 20th July.

2240
02:04:11,870 --> 02:04:15,580
It's July 20th is the date and then
that the next day starts true fast,

2241
02:04:15,620 --> 02:04:18,540
2012 snap those IEPs,

2242
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:21,380
Calgary and shroom tech together,

2243
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:26,530
bringing it back to shut.

2244
02:04:26,531 --> 02:04:29,640
Those will give you very different
performance enhancements there.

2245
02:04:30,290 --> 02:04:32,240
I expect everyone in the
UFC to be on my show.

2246
02:04:32,930 --> 02:04:36,810
Every fighter must test
positive or you're queer.

2247
02:04:37,390 --> 02:04:40,770
Can you imagine if there was like a day
that you had to do it as much of the

2248
02:04:40,870 --> 02:04:44,700
fight, no matter what, but everything
you do, the whole culture just agrees.

2249
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:47,400
There's only one way to get through this
as a hundred percent of us have to do

2250
02:04:47,401 --> 02:04:49,740
mushrooms on this day.
That way nobody's vulnerable.

2251
02:04:49,741 --> 02:04:54,741
Nobody drives around from the period of
12 noon to 8:00 PM there is no fucking

2252
02:04:56,131 --> 02:04:56,820
activity done.

2253
02:04:56,820 --> 02:05:00,390
Get everything you have to get done
before 12 noon than everybody in the whole

2254
02:05:00,391 --> 02:05:03,510
fucking city takes mushrooms.
Wow. That would be amazing.

2255
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:06,120
A beam of light would just go
straight up to heaven. Yeah, we would.

2256
02:05:06,350 --> 02:05:10,920
We would all evolve a hundred
years in one day, a hundred years.

2257
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:14,970
You remember how nice people were after
nine 11 I like everybody was like,

2258
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:18,110
especially in New York, people were
super friendly. They like jolted a,

2259
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:21,420
a bolt of humanity into people
if they want it to be kind.

2260
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:24,180
They wanted to appreciate each other
cause they really did realize that, wow,

2261
02:05:24,181 --> 02:05:27,410
we really are at war and fucked up.
Things can happen at any moment right now.

2262
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:30,810
Just hug somebody and say you love
them and be nice and be friendly.

2263
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:35,310
And this would be like disability the
nation for a while. A did for sure.

2264
02:05:35,790 --> 02:05:38,650
The mushroom day would be like
that times a million. Yeah.

2265
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:42,470
It would be like that times and I'm not
bullshitting if people who haven't in

2266
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:43,530
people who don't agree with me.

2267
02:05:43,531 --> 02:05:46,350
The only reason why you don't agree
with me as if you never done mushrooms,

2268
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:49,500
because if you did do mushrooms and you
thought about it and you thought of how

2269
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:54,270
crazy it experience it was and how much
it is a shared experience when you do it

2270
02:05:54,271 --> 02:05:58,670
with other people that do mushrooms,
drink shared experience. No, no drink.

2271
02:05:58,910 --> 02:06:02,970
I just realize that you are doing the
mushroom duck. Any mushroom talk at all.

2272
02:06:02,971 --> 02:06:03,171
It's true.

2273
02:06:03,171 --> 02:06:07,530
I know that everyone needs to do mushrooms
drank I think together one day it was

2274
02:06:07,531 --> 02:06:10,170
not going to hurt anybody. That would
be the greatest holiday of all time.

2275
02:06:10,410 --> 02:06:14,790
One day. The whole population does
mushrooms in the meantime. Yeah.

2276
02:06:14,850 --> 02:06:19,850
2012 July 21st 22nd or 23rd Shizam so
the Mayan calendar was off by several

2277
02:06:20,970 --> 02:06:21,803
months.
Bitches.

2278
02:06:22,490 --> 02:06:27,420
The porter will be open July
21st where will you be? Oh,

2279
02:06:27,421 --> 02:06:30,260
we're doing a shrimp festival in
Montreal. Oh Jesus Christ. Suntrust.

2280
02:06:30,261 --> 02:06:31,980
What are you doing?
Yeah,

2281
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:36,930
my Charles Cool city for materials shows
Ari that weekend and then a bunch of

2282
02:06:36,931 --> 02:06:39,990
other people do the mushrooms,
the Canada ones. Um,

2283
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:41,400
I've got a couple more coming up too.

2284
02:06:41,401 --> 02:06:45,060
If you want to do any more than I look
in the other ones. You want to do a go,

2285
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:47,440
go back to, um, I'm going
to be there at the same.

2286
02:06:48,370 --> 02:06:49,203
Sure.

2287
02:06:49,690 --> 02:06:53,890
So as Tom and Brenda, so you have a show
at the same day that I have my show.

2288
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:55,300
I think they were around the same time.

2289
02:06:55,330 --> 02:06:58,870
Do you think you could bolt over from
one to the other and do both places?

2290
02:06:58,900 --> 02:07:00,190
Probably.
Would they get mad at you?

2291
02:07:00,650 --> 02:07:05,120
Long as they don't announce it?
Hey. Oops. Anyway, nobody heard it.

2292
02:07:06,780 --> 02:07:10,650
Um, either way I will drag,
can't get Joey up there,

2293
02:07:10,651 --> 02:07:13,680
but I'll get to come regardless the
hangout. Yeah. It should be amazing man.

2294
02:07:13,890 --> 02:07:17,940
That a Massey hall is the fucking coolest
old building too, man. It's like a,

2295
02:07:17,941 --> 02:07:21,020
it really historical place in Toronto.
It's a,

2296
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:23,620
it's one of those places where you find
out other people that have played day.

2297
02:07:23,621 --> 02:07:24,570
Like wow.
It's just like,

2298
02:07:24,571 --> 02:07:28,020
I don't even feel like I should be
allowed to walk around here, man.

2299
02:07:28,021 --> 02:07:31,770
Forget about actually go on stage.
This is like a historical monument.

2300
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:34,170
That's how I fell the Parliament Hill.
Like I thought it was a joke.

2301
02:07:34,171 --> 02:07:36,700
I thought at any time they're going to
come out and say, okay, we punked Ya.

2302
02:07:36,790 --> 02:07:39,940
Did they laugh at my shit man?
They loved it. They didn't laugh.

2303
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:42,850
They laugh and I was talking to
yesterday leaving all my bad words,

2304
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:46,600
everything you played the Union for
parliament in Parliament Hill and nick and

2305
02:07:46,601 --> 02:07:49,830
the clip there were in a
square room scored. There was,

2306
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:52,180
you're a bad mother fucker.
What's amazing?

2307
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:54,580
Me and Brett were just waiting
to get attacked and then like,

2308
02:07:54,581 --> 02:07:57,070
you know when we start talking about
politicians and kind of the corruption,

2309
02:07:57,071 --> 02:07:58,480
how it works, like Ooh,
how are they going to,

2310
02:07:58,530 --> 02:08:00,950
but they were giggling
and laughing and they bow.

2311
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:02,200
They were probably all in the throat.

2312
02:08:02,210 --> 02:08:06,760
Now Irwin Cotler probably all high as
fuck outside there and I got real nervous.

2313
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:09,920
That's hilarious. Trust me,
the building when you walk in,

2314
02:08:09,921 --> 02:08:11,770
the security was worse than the airport.

2315
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:16,330
Like you actually picked up the titanium
in my jaw. Wow. Right. So they were like,

2316
02:08:16,331 --> 02:08:20,040
oh, BP to pickup the stealing your
balls. No, didn't pick that up. That's,

2317
02:08:20,170 --> 02:08:22,630
that's a new and a
Menttium shit undetectable.

2318
02:08:24,810 --> 02:08:27,430
We had some drop that amazing
that you pulled that off man.

2319
02:08:27,431 --> 02:08:31,120
It's amazing that seeing that and seeing
those people sitting there watching

2320
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:33,700
that video,
it's really bizarre to me.

2321
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:37,390
You see my face on that screen is really
strange. This does a strange thing.

2322
02:08:37,420 --> 02:08:41,050
Trust me for us two sitting there like
right next. I had an MP right next to me,

2323
02:08:41,051 --> 02:08:42,460
three conservatives over here,

2324
02:08:42,461 --> 02:08:44,560
senator art and cause I'm going
to be honest with you, man,

2325
02:08:44,561 --> 02:08:46,750
when you came over my house, you're
friends with Todd. I'm like, Yo,

2326
02:08:46,751 --> 02:08:49,760
who's the fuck's gonna Watch this. The,
yeah, yeah, I'll do your documentary.

2327
02:08:49,820 --> 02:08:52,480
It'd be just like all the other
documentaries I did that nobody saw

2328
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:57,670
like 20 of those things.
I probably said the same fucking thing.

2329
02:08:57,671 --> 02:09:01,510
There's probably some dude he copies in
circulation shit on the cutting floor

2330
02:09:01,511 --> 02:09:04,360
somewhere from some other
shitty documentary that I
did where I said the exact

2331
02:09:04,361 --> 02:09:08,350
same shit. I'm so repetitive. It's
ridiculous and it kills that subject.

2332
02:09:08,351 --> 02:09:12,010
That's why you need to do mushrooms. If
the world bitch it also, it also come,

2333
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:15,000
you know, it clicks. It's all in how
you edit it too, right? Yeah. No,

2334
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:19,090
you did a brilliant job. Amazing job. You
really got to put it together. Perfect.

2335
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:22,750
Listen, fuck heads. I love you guys.
I don't really mean to call you. Fuck.

2336
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:26,720
I say that like I treat
you like a treat us. Um,

2337
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:30,700
this thing's got to end at some time and
then now is that time. So Adam score,

2338
02:09:30,701 --> 02:09:33,490
you will see you sir are the shit.
He did a fucking tremendous job.

2339
02:09:33,530 --> 02:09:37,580
You took the ball and you ran with
it. You did an amazing job. Pot.

2340
02:09:38,050 --> 02:09:39,550
That's a good idea.
Are you should fear.

2341
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:43,120
You did a really incredible documentary
and I can't wait to see this culture

2342
02:09:43,121 --> 02:09:47,850
high. It's going to be bad ass.
Fuck yeah, it goes to that.

2343
02:09:47,851 --> 02:09:51,020
I ask him what we should do
something from here. We'll do it.

2344
02:09:51,080 --> 02:09:54,910
We'll do it a about the podcast. We'll do
it. We'll, we'll, there's an interject.

2345
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:58,720
We will interject some podcasts footage
in it and we'll promote it through the

2346
02:09:58,721 --> 02:10:03,490
podcast too. I'll help you out, man.
You're all spread the word buddy.

2347
02:10:03,790 --> 02:10:06,400
Spread the word man. You're doing
an awesome job of just doing that,

2348
02:10:06,401 --> 02:10:09,400
getting that real information out there.
The truth out there,

2349
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:11,260
and you know it's not about hippies folks,

2350
02:10:11,261 --> 02:10:14,140
it's spelled fucking personal liberties
and we've been co opted by. Shit.

2351
02:10:14,141 --> 02:10:17,290
Corporations and Dunkin really give a
fuck about you and we need to recognize

2352
02:10:17,291 --> 02:10:20,740
that it's not patriotic to support
that it's unpatriotic. It's,

2353
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:24,160
it's tough sometimes to buck up
and say the situation is fucked,

2354
02:10:24,610 --> 02:10:26,140
but the people that are going to benefit,

2355
02:10:26,141 --> 02:10:29,080
it's not just going to be people
like us that want to smoke weed.

2356
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:31,870
It's going to be those people that
are suppressing people too because it

2357
02:10:31,871 --> 02:10:34,940
shouldn't be within the law to
allow them to suppress people.

2358
02:10:34,941 --> 02:10:37,430
It is in fact an injustice.

2359
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:40,910
It's a terrible thing where people are
allowed to tell other people what they

2360
02:10:40,911 --> 02:10:42,680
can and can't do.
That doesn't hurt anybody else.

2361
02:10:42,830 --> 02:10:45,320
And when you're doing anything because
you have some sort of a financial gain

2362
02:10:45,321 --> 02:10:49,070
that you're allowed to make some sort of
a loophole judgment and make money from

2363
02:10:49,071 --> 02:10:50,630
that,
that's wrong.

2364
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:54,320
You know it's wrong and I know it's
wrong and the sooner we get you off this

2365
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:55,183
evil tit,

2366
02:10:55,250 --> 02:10:58,610
the better your own personal life would
be because I guarantee you if you're

2367
02:10:58,611 --> 02:11:01,820
running around out there making money off
of keeping weed illegal, you're a con,

2368
02:11:01,850 --> 02:11:04,820
you live a cunt life and
you hate yourself. Okay?

2369
02:11:04,821 --> 02:11:07,080
Cause you realize you're doing
something really creepy and you're,

2370
02:11:07,081 --> 02:11:08,300
you're stopping progress.

2371
02:11:08,420 --> 02:11:12,890
And if you in fact stopped doing that
and instead embrace the psychedelic

2372
02:11:12,891 --> 02:11:15,260
experience instead,
take a fucking yoga class,

2373
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:18,200
go work out before you opened your
mouth in the morning. All right,

2374
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:22,910
get your shit together, bitch. It's
not our fault that we can handle it.

2375
02:11:23,070 --> 02:11:23,903
All right?

2376
02:11:24,590 --> 02:11:29,030
Step the fuck up and fall out of
score you on Twitter. It's got a,

2377
02:11:29,031 --> 02:11:32,660
it's his real name as s, c, O, r. G. I. E.

2378
02:11:32,661 --> 02:11:37,040
But he thinks you're retarded.
So he spells it different.

2379
02:11:37,041 --> 02:11:41,180
He goes s, c, O, r, e
and then a big G. Yeah.

2380
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:43,490
Just to emphasize,
you are brilliant.

2381
02:11:43,491 --> 02:11:47,290
You did it phonetically
Gorgie productions, right? So

2382
02:11:48,990 --> 02:11:52,640
that's your production company
production makes it slightly less clever.

2383
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:56,500
Not because I'm a g, but just also
it's it. It's only Twitter handle.

2384
02:11:56,501 --> 02:11:59,780
I could get the other one I'd used on
the union one by accident so I had to use

2385
02:11:59,781 --> 02:12:02,130
that one. Oh, so, but you still
have the union on Twitter as well.

2386
02:12:02,150 --> 02:12:04,010
Can they follow that as well?
They follow that as well.

2387
02:12:04,011 --> 02:12:07,430
And then also the culture is on there
already and nice. Nice. And when,

2388
02:12:07,431 --> 02:12:10,880
when he planted on getting this ball
fully rolling with this culture high fall

2389
02:12:10,881 --> 02:12:13,970
August versus when the deadline
ends for the Kickstarter run.

2390
02:12:13,971 --> 02:12:17,750
And then we'd go into production in
September, our full production in some,

2391
02:12:18,790 --> 02:12:21,320
well Brian and I hope to be a
part of this, correct Brian,

2392
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:26,450
are we down hundred percent bitch and
you guys already should fear powerful.

2393
02:12:26,451 --> 02:12:30,470
Ari Shaffir please follow him.
Smokes smuggles we'd all over the country.

2394
02:12:31,010 --> 02:12:34,970
How dare you.
We're not going to tell you all about me.

2395
02:12:34,971 --> 02:12:38,750
And Ari does edit a new day to the
San Diego shadows. How dare you.

2396
02:12:38,751 --> 02:12:43,070
What Day is this? This
Thursday. So Thursday, Friday.
I will be there on Friday.

2397
02:12:43,070 --> 02:12:45,560
I do not know if I'll be there on Saturday
right now it doesn't look like it,

2398
02:12:45,561 --> 02:12:47,240
but I'll be there on Friday.
Going to be there. I'm sorry.

2399
02:12:47,330 --> 02:12:50,360
What'd you that American comedy company
thing. I'm going to go see the comicon.

2400
02:12:50,390 --> 02:12:53,240
Never been to comic con man. It's like
Mecca. I got to go there before I die.

2401
02:12:54,110 --> 02:12:55,790
Before the Mayans.
Correct.

2402
02:12:55,791 --> 02:12:59,180
Correctly predict because you got rid
of the bureaus and your presence in our

2403
02:12:59,450 --> 02:13:02,780
atmosphere. Do you believe
in a, on an Aki? I,

2404
02:13:02,781 --> 02:13:05,660
I've heard your theories about
it and I got no theories son.

2405
02:13:06,130 --> 02:13:09,400
I got to know the area.
You see Prometheans yes I
did. It was good. Hey Man,

2406
02:13:09,401 --> 02:13:12,020
I did not think it was good. You
didn't like, no, I did not like a man.

2407
02:13:12,021 --> 02:13:13,900
People are split on that thing and I like,

2408
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:19,160
I thought it was a brilliant and moments
in a thoroughly enjoyed it for long

2409
02:13:19,161 --> 02:13:19,940
chunks,

2410
02:13:19,940 --> 02:13:23,840
but ultimately as a whole I felt like
you got to way too many cuts of shit

2411
02:13:23,841 --> 02:13:28,320
scenes for me. Fuck me with the fucking
spaceship landing on the chicken cheese.

2412
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:33,210
Okay. Sorry. Spoiler
spoiler, spoiler, spoiler.

2413
02:13:33,390 --> 02:13:37,260
But I would see it again because I'm a
retard and I love Scifi movies and Ridley

2414
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:40,460
Scott is still God. Yeah.
That's so fucking Dork to say.

2415
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:45,120
Someone who's got really Mazi is God.
You know Ridley Scott is God,

2416
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:47,610
it's amazing director. Oh, I'd
love to talk to them about how,

2417
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:50,460
how he fucks a fleshlight.
How'd that, how'd that,

2418
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:55,680
how'd that guy would love to be cuddled
by the inside wall of the flashlight?

2419
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:57,630
Because Ladies and gentlemen,
there is no better feeling.

2420
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:02,520
The love of your friends is
number one family right up there.

2421
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:04,170
And then there's a flashlight folks.

2422
02:14:04,171 --> 02:14:07,260
It's like the best vagina
you really could ever invent.

2423
02:14:07,530 --> 02:14:10,350
And if it just moves on its own,
it would be too perfect.

2424
02:14:10,351 --> 02:14:11,700
And that's all you would do all day.

2425
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:15,780
You should be lucky that it's a manual
thing is the lazy cunt that I know you

2426
02:14:15,781 --> 02:14:16,710
are.
You know,

2427
02:14:16,711 --> 02:14:19,260
you're going to give it a couple of
thrust and then you gotta throw it in the

2428
02:14:19,261 --> 02:14:22,860
corner of pass out probably without even
pulling your pants up. You sick. Fuck.

2429
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:27,060
What if I had a fleshlight that you know
that the cousin and that would do that,

2430
02:14:27,061 --> 02:14:31,650
like crawl over to you and oh yeah,
that would be fabulous.

2431
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:35,600
Be found. Again, you'd have guys
never leave right next morning would,

2432
02:14:35,610 --> 02:14:38,090
but you would start feeling jealous or,
or rather a,

2433
02:14:38,091 --> 02:14:41,610
you'd start feeling guilty that you are
doing this and this is no way to live

2434
02:14:41,611 --> 02:14:42,001
your life.

2435
02:14:42,001 --> 02:14:45,540
Just getting sucked off everyday by a
robot and you'd go out and you try to find

2436
02:14:45,541 --> 02:14:47,250
like the most religious girl possible.

2437
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:51,000
They'd probably completely ruined your
actual real sex life because you will

2438
02:14:51,001 --> 02:14:54,060
completely disassociate sex
from being like a physical need.

2439
02:14:54,061 --> 02:14:57,960
And instead it will become like this
really heavy duty emotional thing.

2440
02:14:58,830 --> 02:15:00,260
Fuck this shit.

2441
02:15:00,370 --> 02:15:04,290
Like some chickens in the 50
shades of gray and you'll find her.

2442
02:15:04,530 --> 02:15:08,850
And then together you guys could just
slow kiss and you never come ever again.

2443
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:13,570
And then thanked the flashlight.
You go to Joe rogan.net. Yeah.

2444
02:15:13,590 --> 02:15:17,100
And even the code date Brogan and you
save yourself 15% off the number one sex

2445
02:15:17,101 --> 02:15:17,934
toy from Matt.

2446
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:20,880
Yeah,
I'm doing it all luck,

2447
02:15:21,380 --> 02:15:26,380
boy. Now go to [inaudible] Dot Com O. N.
N. I. T. Get yourself some battle ropes.

2448
02:15:26,381 --> 02:15:30,940
Battle ropes is the latest thing,
the fucking latest goddamn fitness craze.

2449
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:35,970
Crazy 40 foot long ropes that you swing
around like a fucking savage pirate type

2450
02:15:37,031 --> 02:15:42,010
character from a thousand years back.
And get yourself some kettlebells too,

2451
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:46,660
so you can be a manly man and stop. Stop
doing your bicep curls. You little bitch.

2452
02:15:47,130 --> 02:15:49,330
Let's do a pushup. At least do
some pushups. Do you know? Well,

2453
02:15:49,331 --> 02:15:50,590
you don't have to do anything really.
