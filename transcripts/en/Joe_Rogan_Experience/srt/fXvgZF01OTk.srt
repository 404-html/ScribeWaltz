1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,310
Five,
four,

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:05,970
three,
two,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
one.
The first man to smoke marijuana never 

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,780
really smoked it and held.
It was a Chinese man.

5
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:17,010
He was a very great man and whenever he 
lit the plant,

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,820
it wasn't to get high,
but he would start to get high and every

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:25,821
time he got high,
a blue bird would come to him and tell 

8
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:30,261
him to conquer his neighboring 
neighborhoods and he listened to those 

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,710
to the bird and that's exactly what he 
did and he became a great emperor in 

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,581
China at that point in the story.
Pablo Escobar because his doctor and he 

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,680
goes,
have you ever been to Disney land?

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,220
And the doctor goes,
no,

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,590
Pablo,
I have this very clean,

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,110
very organized.
Well that's it,

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,910
but it's the truth.
First gather Chinese dude that burnt the

16
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:04,680
plant because he liked the smell of the 
plant and gave him a soothing.

17
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,310
But after days of doing it,
it packed up in his body and he started 

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,361
to loosen that and he saw a blue bird.
Blue Bird came to him and told him that 

19
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:19,431
he had to conquer the neighborhoods 
within a region or crazy bird.

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,210
He got high and a bird started talking 
to them.

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,770
What are you gonna do you know?
Uh,

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,910
I don't know if this is true,
but this is one of the things that are 

23
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,150
the part of fishing Nana was always used
to say is that,

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,210
you know,
when a priest walks down the aisle and 

25
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,140
they have that thing that they swing and
there's burning incense inside of it.

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,370
They used to be,
we'd.

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,230
That's what they used to do was to be in
what dimension?

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,950
I don't know.
At one point,

29
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:48,951
I believe it was,
we got it became that shit that Batman 

30
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:51,600
shot at the Green Hornet like pedophile 
smoke.

31
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,890
You,
you wake up,

32
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:54,660
your shirts bombed backwards.
This shit.

33
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:55,800
Your pants are missing.

34
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,300
Well,
what did,

35
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,560
what is it now?
What kind of instances?

36
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,490
It's smoke.
I,

37
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,650
I go in there,
the church,

38
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:07,230
every once in a while now you have to go
for the full effect.

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,240
One like the five in the afternoon on 
Saturday and the early morning Sunday 

40
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,041
they don't break out the incense that 
don't start breaking out the fucking 

41
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,731
Melaleuca fucking some kid and the guy 
comes out and when the guy comes out 

42
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:23,490
their own water,
Jesus and then the other guy.

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,020
It's so weird how somebody made a great 
point on twitter the other day.

44
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:30,810
They said,
you me,

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,900
Mitch Hedberg,
if there's five of us to deliver 

46
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,220
newspapers is $5.
The delivered newspapers.

47
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,230
You Hedberg did it?
Yeah.

48
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:45,231
You delivered them in a call the other 
places I was an asshole that took a 

49
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,310
route but not the route in my 
neighborhood.

50
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,710
The route in the neighborhood over,
so I had to beat the kids there before 

51
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,641
they get there and steal the papers.
I would deliver them right to the doors 

52
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:57,180
and all.
You did too and then you collected.

53
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,890
I collected from only a handful of 
people.

54
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,190
Most

55
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,470
people are on like a monthly 
subscription plan.

56
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,060
They had.
They were switching over,

57
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,820
but the people that you'd have to 
collect from Yeley this envelope,

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,080
like a tan envelope and you had to mark 
off like,

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,470
you know when they owe things that I 
barely remember it because it was only a

60
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:18,340
couple of the clients and after awhile I
kind of got away from doing them.

61
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,670
I said,
I don't want to do these people that 

62
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,670
have because it's too hard to collect.
It's annoying.

63
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,670
Like I don't want to.
I don't want to have to go to.

64
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,170
That was I didn't like it must have 
been.

65
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:31,171
That was just when I first got a 
Catholic school and my mom gave me an 

66
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:32,100
option that I had to go up there and 
work in the afternoon.

67
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,100
I got to figure something out.
I just don't want to go up there anymore

68
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,740
and my friend said I'm giving up my 
newspaper route,

69
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,440
but he didn't give up the one that my 
navel.

70
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,430
He gave up the one and the next city 
over the next town over that city.

71
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,610
I could still walk day so I'd have to 
leave school run over there because of 

72
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,960
not the dude who steal my papers and 
sell them as their own,

73
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,020
the fucking street corners,
so I'd have to get them,

74
00:03:56,021 --> 00:04:01,021
put the circulars in,
put them in a thing and then throw them 

75
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:04,201
on people's balcony and then on Fridays 
and Saturdays I have to go back with a 

76
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:07,690
ring after dinner and collect.
How you doing Mr Rogan.

77
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,900
I'm here to pick up seventy five cents 
and they give you like a dollar 50.

78
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:15,901
That was your tip and you got like 
twenty two cents a week for the of the 

79
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:16,750
paper.
Did you collect from everybody?

80
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,730
I collected from everybody.
I was this.

81
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,010
What years were these?
This has to be 73.

82
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:26,680
Seventy four.
Seventy five.

83
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,740
Yeah.
So I guess when I started doing it is 

84
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,201
when I started driving,
which had been like 83.

85
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,960
I probably started 83.
I probably started when I was 17.

86
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,490
No,
that was 85.

87
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,700
80 five probably.
Then that's when I probably started 

88
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:44,700
doing it.
Or you're too old to be collected.

89
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,280
I wouldn't be either.
Well it wasn't even that,

90
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,590
it was just annoying,
like what you wanted to do was go to the

91
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,150
depot,
pick up the papers,

92
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:54,520
chuck them into the People's driveways 
and that's it.

93
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,550
And then there was a few people that 
wanted it inside the door so you'd have 

94
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,370
to get out of your car,
open up their screen door,

95
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:04,300
put it in there and then leave.
And the idea was that those people,

96
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,860
everybody would say those people tip you
better.

97
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,510
Those two,
Delta p Bennett Miller.

98
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:12,511
Okay.
And so we would only have like a few of 

99
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:15,901
those and I think after the first couple
of years they stopped doing those kinds 

100
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:18,640
of collections or I definitely stopped 
doing them.

101
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,750
But it was an awesome job when you were 
like a young comic or you know,

102
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,010
even before it was a comical and I was 
fighting,

103
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,460
it was just a.
I didn't have to do anything where 

104
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,640
someone was telling me what to do.
I could get my car,

105
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,840
I could listen to whatever I wanted to.
I listened to Charles Laquidara,

106
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,120
he had a,
the morning the big mattress on,

107
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,420
I think it was bcn.
I'm pretty sure it's wbcn in Boston,

108
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,050
which is awesome radio show.
I listened to that.

109
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,650
Chuck newspapers out windows.
I do that for like three hours every 

110
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:55,680
day,
you know?

111
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,980
It was the best ever because

112
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,000
then I would make enough money where I 
could pay my bills,

113
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,540
but I still had all the time in the 
world.

114
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,120
You stand up

115
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,280
all the time,
the world train all the time in the 

116
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,531
world do anything,
but it definitely fucked me up because 

117
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:16,040
you're not supposed to be getting up 
that early every day.

118
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,040
Like that can't be good for you.
You know,

119
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,890
if you listen to people that know things
about sleep,

120
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,500
like getting up at 4:30
in the morning or five in the morning 

121
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,720
every day and not being responsible.
That was the beginning.

122
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,110
To me.
That was the beginning of the new Joe 

123
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,800
Rogan podcast.
That was the first podcast I listened to

124
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,680
that I agreed with a lot.
What else?

125
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:44,681
I had a couple of mitigating factors 
because I believe that everybody's body 

126
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:46,700
is a lot different.
I know I could rock and roll.

127
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,810
I could throw down on seventh street,
but it's got to be seven straight.

128
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,610
No,
nothing.

129
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,750
No.
Get up the two times because once you're

130
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,820
50 it could be up and down.

131
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,970
See,
once you turn 50,

132
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,200
48,
everything changed his papa.

133
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,340
So if you had night chicken come to it 
was.

134
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,370
It has to come up throughout the night 
and you will be up all fucking night on 

135
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:10,640
the hour.
Every hour.

136
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:13,790
There's no rem sleep.
There's no rem sleep.

137
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,280
So you have to come control once you get
old,

138
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:21,281
you have to control your thyroid dog.
I've been a specialist on asleep since 

139
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:25,751
day one.
That was one of the most interesting 

140
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:27,730
podcasts you had.
I bought the book and everything and he 

141
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,040
made some great points in there.
I didn't.

142
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,780
I wasn't raised under that.
Joe Rogan.

143
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,480
My mom didn't raise me once we came from
Cuba,

144
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,280
my dad died.
There was no nap.

145
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:38,350
I went with.
She went right.

146
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,100
So Mike Day Consisted of eight to three 
in the morning.

147
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,570
She had a manager's room in the back of 
the bar with a cop.

148
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,910
If I got tired at one,
go back there and take a nap,

149
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:51,640
but I gotta stay here till three Momma 
got to work.

150
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,030
Wow.
So my sleep was always her and then when

151
00:07:57,431 --> 00:08:02,260
I was five or six in school that I went 
to normal sleep,

152
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:04,870
I went to Catholic grammar school,
normal sleep,

153
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,000
everything was normal,
but my mom had a bad thing that she did.

154
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,190
My mom had an issue that a lot of 
parents don't do when they work nights.

155
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,040
It was.
She did it from the heart because I have

156
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,280
a friend who does it.
Wake you up at three in the morning,

157
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,900
Joe Rogan,
Joe Rogan.

158
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,510
Get up black ink and Pasta,
which really from them burritos.

159
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,320
And I brought you a newspaper.
Are you fucking kidding me?

160
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,700
Can you imagine if I woke you up and it 
to when you're 26 years old joe at 3:30

161
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:41,701
in the morning and you know I'm doing it
from my heart and seven out of 10 times 

162
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:42,660
you're going to get up and eat the 
school.

163
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,680
Julie or the or the Marinara Sandwich I 
brought you from Leo is because they 

164
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,430
worked in the city,
so if you remember,

165
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,420
if you bartending in New York City on 
the way home,

166
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,620
he stopped.
No,

167
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:58,621
you stopped and get two slices of 
fucking the best pizza there isn't 

168
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,180
Manhattan.
So my mom would wake me up every night 

169
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,420
at 3:30
in the morning with the Cuban sandwich 

170
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,600
that killed me over the years.
That would make me get up every night at

171
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:13,601
three.
They're still nights that I'll be 

172
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:13,601
sleeping.
I get a good night's sleep,

173
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:18,271
but I'll look at the clock and it's 3:00
AM on the fucking died because it's in 

174
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:22,270
my.
But like last night I slept good.

175
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,450
I fucked up.
My sleep was bad after I read the book 

176
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:27,910
for a while.
That's how deep it got into my head.

177
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,330
So when I went back to weightwatchers I 
realized I couldn't eat anymore fucking 

178
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,280
edibles because they wouldn't.
They would make me hungry at night.

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,190
I would fucking go off the charts with 
points.

180
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,740
So I stopped eating edibles and Joe 
Rogan.

181
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:45,280
My sleep pattern changed bad,

182
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,980
like my body did not know how to go to 
fall asleep by itself.

183
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,510
I went through a month or two while I 
was asleep.

184
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,330
Jesus doing with a bunch of shit and 
then three more hours.

185
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,150
Yeah.
Did you try anything?

186
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:03,520
Did you try like Melatonin or anything 
like that?

187
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,260
I did cocaine for 30 years and Melatonin
the 23rd stick it all suck.

188
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:10,450
My Dick Gaba,
Gaba,

189
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,370
google,
Google.

190
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,800
I drink them all together.
The vine.

191
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,890
Leave me alone.
Please leave me the fuck alone.

192
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,680
Fuck this.
Awesome.

193
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,580
I got something.
That's Gaba,

194
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:26,430
Gaba the tea and the trip depending put 
together and they still don't find.

195
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,570
I buy it on Amazon.
I'm bad.

196
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,570
So what I learned to do was rotate it.

197
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,910
So now I'm back on the animals.
I found that about an expired bag of 

198
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,331
Chiba chews,
like the Dave Chappelle to when I went 

199
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:43,440
out with Dave and I found the bag with 
about 24.

200
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,070
Oh my God.
I slice them in half.

201
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:48,560
You take one of those where you wake up 
at six in the morning.

202
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,350
[inaudible] Brown expired.
You understand me?

203
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,140
What happened to me?
IED expired edibles.

204
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,120
Same thing when you eating expired 
Vikatin.

205
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,560
Listen to this.
Listen to this.

206
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:02,520
Listen to this shit.
Ain't fucking around though.

207
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,240
This works.
The jaw.

208
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:06,190
This is.
You got to fight Joe Schilling.

209
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:11,191
He to have these copies back on Monday.
Ain't ain't nobody knocking you out 

210
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:15,751
after he eat one of these times.
Things don't put you in another 

211
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:15,751
dimension.
My God,

212
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,130
I've been in a fucking another dimension
since last week and I don't give a fuck.

213
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,230
I have not left the house in a week.

214
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,900
Do you understand me?
I ate two of them on Saturday.

215
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:25,020
I know you up at night or how beautiful 
though.

216
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,370
Beautiful.
Mangement.

217
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,560
Tremendous.
The nicest people.

218
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:33,240
I took a bunch of really smart people 
that it,

219
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,930
you know,
fuck him.

220
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,820
Fuck Portland.
Fuck New York.

221
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,030
Fuck Chicago.
Take to get mad with blowing up boise.

222
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:45,700
They want to keep it low key.
They want to keep them low.

223
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,070
Kids fucking all of those areas.
You can ski up there.

224
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,120
Ain't got everything up there.
Nobody knows.

225
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,290
Yeah.
They got couple people that hate black 

226
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:57,290
people,
but they keep on the side of the state.

227
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,560
Mark Furman's up there,
fucking Oj sister in law.

228
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,390
You know what I'm saying?
It's all right.

229
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,530
It turned right.
No,

230
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:03,820
no,
no.

231
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:05,430
It's beautiful.
Then you went to sign.

232
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,200
My friend who I kidnap showed up your 
show.

233
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,760
He said he had a great time.
I go,

234
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:14,761
why don't you say a little Brogan?
You could have done a podcast right 

235
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:14,761
there.

236
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:14,761
You said he was embarrassed,

237
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,700
but Saturday night I paid the fucking 
edible Joe Rogan.

238
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,810
I ate two of these expired ones.
I eat one that I said,

239
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:31,420
let me take a chance.
It's Saturday night and a nother one and

240
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,440
I noticed your movie was coming up and 
it is fucking what a phenomenal movie.

241
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,890
Midnight Express.
When they catch the kid coming back from

242
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:44,260
Turkey with Hash on his body,
Joe Rogan.

243
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,400
That is one of the most hardest movies 
you ever fucking watch in the Goddamn 

244
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,970
the first 30 minutes of that like I 
thought I was going to die.

245
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:58,971
Like when they let him go through and 
they played him and as soon as he hit 

246
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:00,950
the fucking plane,
they turned them around,

247
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,960
ripped his shirt,
and they dropped in their hands and 

248
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,720
knees and they gave him the seven years 
and they started raping them.

249
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,140
Jesus.
But I watched up to the part where 

250
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,240
fucking he became friends with this 
dude.

251
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:17,241
They had a cat and the dude name was 
likey likey like he was the guy's name 

252
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,960
and Leckie killed the cat and they let 
this American.

253
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:26,790
Now you don't have point where even 
Michael Douglas and was that movie.

254
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,150
He's on the four or five and he just 
snaps fighting back.

255
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,420
Michael.

256
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:36,230
Then they tried to rob them.
The three Mexicans try to rob him from 

257
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,230
the suitcase.
What was that?

258
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,500
Sorry?
What was falling down?

259
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:44,060
Falling.
He had like his day like that was it.

260
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:48,600
That was the last day to fucking live.
This

261
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,080
finds that they killed that poor 
Americans cat and he throws a fucking 

262
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,840
beat on this left dude.
Joe Rogan isn't one of the most 

263
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,771
disturbing beatings.
There's too disturbing beatings or film 

264
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:05,770
history.
That's number two because he closes it 

265
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:05,770
out because the guy was a rat,

266
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,070
so after he throws a beat man,
look.

267
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,370
Yeah,
yeah,

268
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:08,790
yeah,
yeah.

269
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:13,791
Right there.
He spitting up and guy's tongue in the 

270
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,490
air and they showed it on.
I gotta give a shout out.

271
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:20,491
The Turner classic movies.
You motherfuckers been growing heat the 

272
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:22,740
last six days they had on something else
last night that the gambler on the other

273
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:26,340
night that followed this.
This is the 40th anniversary,

274
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:28,820
Joe Rogan.
He throws a beat man.

275
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,760
Them opens his mouth.
I'm thinking the guy's being a nice guy.

276
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:36,040
He's going to give him mouth to mouth 
and saved the guy's life fucked low.

277
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,060
You see him going and he just pulls up 
like this,

278
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,620
Joe.
They slow it up.

279
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,180
Only I'll call fucking real director 
that on the waterfront last night.

280
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:53,181
Jesus ain't fucking around.
And they once I was watching like what 

281
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:54,920
is the commercials?
And they said,

282
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:59,921
fuck.
One time I had my mother's will play 

283
00:14:59,921 --> 00:14:59,921
this hand.

284
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:00,140
Now they're going to show the tongue.
Joe Rogan.

285
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:05,141
He takes it out.
Did you could see the rage from the 

286
00:15:05,141 --> 00:15:07,010
fucking eight years in a Turkish jail 
getting fucked in the ass?

287
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,630
Eat that Hummus,
drinking that fuck them watered down tea

288
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:16,330
from Korea and he just spits his fucking
look at this.

289
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,610
Beaten the best beat in of all time.
There's only one better beaten.

290
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,620
Our board a Mexican when he beat up a 
pilot.

291
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,380
This is Leptin.
Jesus.

292
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,050
Dude,
I forgot about this move.

293
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,100
This is a classic.
This is a classic seventies movie.

294
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,160
This is crazy,
dude.

295
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,480
Look at him.
He's just.

296
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:40,700
This is eight years of getting beat up 
every day.

297
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,710
I'm not.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

298
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:47,711
You fucking fuck dude.

299
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,340
This is an intense scene.
What year is this moving?

300
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,350
Seventy eight.
I was a kid.

301
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,330
I still remember going to see this in 
the movies.

302
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm leaving.
They're like dog.

303
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,970
I ain't ever gone to Turkey.
Jesus Christ.

304
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,190
The scene for the people that are just 
listening.

305
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,780
Um,
he's,

306
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,660
he's tearing apart this bathroom to get 
it.

307
00:16:09,661 --> 00:16:12,060
This guy,
I don't remember who the guy is.

308
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,180
He is the guy that sells more than down 
hash and he rats you out and he's just a

309
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:22,491
creepy fucking dude,
and then to finally push them over to 

310
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:23,160
tap,
he hangs his hat.

311
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,470
He wakes up to his cat being hung and 
right here people.

312
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,240
This is the fucking strength of the 
seventies.

313
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,280
Balls to the wall.
Oh,

314
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,020
smashes.
Yeah.

315
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,520
No,
this is real deal.

316
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,200
Real right here,
Huh?

317
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,690
Oh Shit.
Are you fucking nuts?

318
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:47,730
Good morning.
Here's the fourth of July.

319
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,400
You're fucking with an American 
motherfuckers.

320
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,490
Even in Turkey,
we lose our fucking minds.

321
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,820
That guy must've been half Armenian when
he bit his tongue out.

322
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,440
There you go.
Dude.

323
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,520
This was.
This guy.

324
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:02,910
Ended up dying of AIDS in real life.
This is a strong,

325
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:07,911
strong.
Next time you had guy was a real life 

326
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:08,040
guy in this guy.
The actor.

327
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,330
Who was he?
What was his name?

328
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:10,710
I forget what his name.
Brett.

329
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,510
Brett.
Brad Davis.

330
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:17,810
Jesus.
Then the second best beating is our man 

331
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,920
Anthony Quinn.
At the end when he was 80,

332
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:28,160
he beat the shit out of the good looking
dude for fucking his girl friend,

333
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:33,161
Mariel stope.
Madeline stowe and a movie called 

334
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:35,700
revenge that.
Oh yeah,

335
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:40,701
I remember revenge.
Kevin Cost Kevin Costner and then he 

336
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:42,900
slices a face and he fucking put your in
a whorehouse right?

337
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,660
Fucked in the ass every hour on the 
hour.

338
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,200
Fucking this is it.
It's a fourth of July.

339
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,070
Get his shit

340
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,030
together.
You know what I'm saying?

341
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,840
If Alex Jones is correct,
we'll go on and have a civil war today.

342
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,930
So what the fuck you talked to Alex,
you've got to calm them down.

343
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:03,290
Alex.
you gotta calm down talking about a 

344
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:03,290
civil war.
He had me doing an extra achievement.

345
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,341
Judy the other night I was polishing the
fuck and the musket.

346
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,210
Alex thinks I'm defending the new world 
order because I didn't think that George

347
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:17,210
Soros was a Nazi.
It's also painful.

348
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,620
What's up Joe?
Rob?

349
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,140
Nothing.
What's happening brother?

350
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,110
Everything's great,
man.

351
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:24,270
I mean,
I feel good.

352
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,230
Alex Jones.
I love you buddy for real.

353
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,760
But you say some silly shit.
That's where this all comes from.

354
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,490
It doesn't mean I don't love you.
You're a great guy,

355
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,480
but there's some shit that's just silly.
It's wasted time.

356
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,290
You know?
That's one of those things,

357
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:47,440
it's just a waste of time.
Does that make sense?

358
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,980
I'm with you.
I think there's real conspiracies,

359
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,440
you know,
but I think there's some that,

360
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,880
you know,
people just get caught up and looking 

361
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,130
for conspiracies and everything and 
after a while it's exhausting.

362
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,950
Let's get the ball off the table.
I love the guy with the podcasts with 

363
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,460
already last week,
yesterday,

364
00:19:07,461 --> 00:19:11,370
18 attorney's son.
Alex Jones going to hear that.

365
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:12,900
So I'm just like,
I'll finish.

366
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,710
Okay.
I'm so sorry.

367
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,280
No,
it's okay.

368
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:15,840
It's just,
I love the guy.

369
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,900
I really do.
I just don't support a lot of the shit 

370
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:20,900
that he said.
Like the sandy hook stuff.

371
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,430
I don't know if he's since disavowed 
that.

372
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:25,950
I don't know if he changed his opinion 
on it.

373
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:30,951
I don't know what it is,
but at a certain point in time you're 

374
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:30,951
like,
Jesus,

375
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:30,951
man,
are you,

376
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:32,040
are you sure?
Like,

377
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,520
you got to be really sure before you say
something crazy like that.

378
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,350
Right,
don't you?

379
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,130
I mean,
don't you think?

380
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,150
Look,
I think he's a great guy and as a person

381
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,130
I'm not attacking it.

382
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,660
I just,
uh,

383
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:54,560
when he goes crazy and gets mad at me,
I love,

384
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:59,561
I want to hug them.
I love Lee told me this story about 

385
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:00,770
trucks pulling up in front of your house
and they could see through your walls.

386
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,910
They probably can do that.
They do that in different neighborhoods.

387
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,070
You know,
I like to do something like that,

388
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,900
but then have to five of those and this 
was my experience.

389
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,060
He'll tell you something that you got to
sit there and go,

390
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:17,150
what the fuck am I doing sitting here?
But that's cool.

391
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,940
That's Alex and we accept them for what 
the fuck is.

392
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,130
I just thought it was a civil war 
starting today.

393
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,350
I really don't.
He was saying the Democrats are going at

394
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,160
it today.
So somebody shooting somebody.

395
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,890
So who the fuck knows to just to calm 
alex down.

396
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:32,450
Nobody's telling me what to say.

397
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,260
No one's telling me what to do.
I'm not involved in new world order.

398
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,990
Who's the new world?
Just enlightened me about the new.

399
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,330
I'm not sure.
I'm not involved though.

400
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,130
I just want Alex to know.
Not involved.

401
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,250
Who were those people you met the other 
day where you get a new world daughter?

402
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,690
Who's the people,
the people you see you eat.

403
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,650
Which Smart,
oh,

404
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,950
these are all podcasters and former 
professors and all these different 

405
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:59,140
people that are doing different things 
together.

406
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,700
Just scared me the other day though.
Yeah,

407
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,780
on the ropes,
right?

408
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:03,670
He was taking.
He went back with the CIA.

409
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,850
What are you talking about?
I ain't gonna say nothing either cheaper

410
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:16,480
too.
It's fourth of July.

411
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,790
Fireworks like fucking CBS Radford,
I think.

412
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,380
I think conspiracies are fun and that's 
part of the problem with conspiracies.

413
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:28,390
They're fun.
They're fun to chase down.

414
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,370
They really are.
They're interests.

415
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,400
I'll tell you what's fun to chase down,
to read about one and to absorb it by 

416
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,631
yourself.
Once I get into a room with three men 

417
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,080
and we're on a conspiracy for 48 
minutes,

418
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,330
that's when I get aggravated.
Well,

419
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,160
that's what I don't ever want to talk 
about.

420
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,220
That's what the shit that kills me.
I don't have the time to discuss with 

421
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,960
little moon landing or that we all have 
an idea of what we think happened.

422
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,770
Guess what?
I really don't want to talk about not on

423
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:58,940
the fucking fourth of July.
No.

424
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,140
The problem with them is,
and this is a tendency,

425
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,080
is that when people get really into 
conspiracy theories,

426
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,660
they're into everything being a 
conspiracy.

427
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,230
It's not like they're into conspiracy 
theories and also into the history of 

428
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,801
Cuba and then give you a detailed 
history of some really crazy shit that 

429
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:21,121
went down like how many people that are 
really into conspiracy theories could 

430
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:23,440
give you a rundown on how Castro took 
over Cuba,

431
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,240
which is like a real thing that happened
in our parents' lifetimes.

432
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,190
Right?
Think about that.

433
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,400
How many people that are really into 
like,

434
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:39,710
you know,
whether or not there's bases on the 

435
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:39,710
moon.
No,

436
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,490
about,
you know,

437
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:42,770
all these different things that have 
happened through human history.

438
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,220
The Mongols,
the Roman Empire,

439
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:51,221
the Greek camp.
Either this crazy shit that definitely 

440
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:53,771
really happened.
All the stuff that happened during the 

441
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:57,700
Vietnam War,
all the stuff that happened during the 

442
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:57,700
Nixon administration.
All that stuff's real.

443
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,620
It's fascinating,
fascinating shit to look into,

444
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,050
but then you get the dumb ones like,
Oh God,

445
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,450
we really discussed and whether or not 
the earth is flat.

446
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,810
Is this a real conversation like people 
really doing that satellites aren't real

447
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,260
goal on social media.
You'll find a bunch of people to agree 

448
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,630
with you.
Two.

449
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,770
Got To be so careful about not listening
to scientists looked at it with going 

450
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,270
Saturday,
Sunday night,

451
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,330
Sunday night on there,
50 years or 60 minutes.

452
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,540
It was showing how they interviewed 
different people.

453
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:39,770
Now the one guy went to some crusade 
assignment,

454
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,640
Saddam Hussein's and he said to him,
ask him to tell him that this

455
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,690
guy said he's crazy and the interpreter 
looked at him and says,

456
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,150
you,
you think Jerry?

457
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,810
I ain't asked her that and there was 
both.

458
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,200
There was one particular interview and 
he was just talking about the interview.

459
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,210
He was one of the best interviews he 
ever did was when he pushed the guy,

460
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:05,510
the guy that was standing behind Kennedy
in the car,

461
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,590
the the,
the agent that should have taken the 

462
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,060
bullet for Kennedy.
They interviewed that guy.

463
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,000
That's a great.
You got on that one now,

464
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,130
but he was one step behind.
I mean,

465
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:21,420
he breaks down into tears.
He's a real American,

466
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:23,990
like this is a guy that's a real 
American.

467
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,250
Took that job and then like it wasn't 
your fault and he's like,

468
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:31,520
you don't understand.
I was a second behind.

469
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,180
If I would have been there just one 
second earlier,

470
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:38,660
I would've caught it in my back and the 
president would have been a lot.

471
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,370
I mean,
it's fucking crazy.

472
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,010
Jesus.
He imagined being dedicated to protect a

473
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:51,011
guy with your own life and to really 
drink the serum and to believe it like 

474
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:57,131
like a fucking soldier.
Those serves very special human beings 

475
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,340
that can do that.
Not a lot of human beings that have that

476
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:06,341
kind of resolve or throw their life in 
front of a bullet to protect someone 

477
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:08,360
else's.
That's intense.

478
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,870
It is intense pain.
You have to hear where the bullet is 

479
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,460
coming from,
what your response time as the B to b.

480
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:23,500
This is when you were real high level 
body guard.

481
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,830
This is.
You are the highest of the highest.

482
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:32,831
You're hearing is impeccable.
This means when you're walking down the 

483
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:37,181
street with this guy inside,
you have to learn by yourself how the 

484
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:43,790
shadow of nature and noises and listened
to footsteps,

485
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,440
weapons,
clicking,

486
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,330
holsters,
opening.

487
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,580
Think of how interesting.

488
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,480
Just that alone is.
That's why sometimes when you see him,

489
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:58,481
they're holding one ear because there's 
zero with anything particular a car's 

490
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:04,751
tires screeching differently.
Think of that fucking job because that's

491
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:08,830
what their job is to react to that.
So if there's.

492
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,420
If Joe Rogan has eight guys when they 
train,

493
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,480
and I don't even know.
I've never trained in Quantico,

494
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,550
but I just know that I think the first 
two guys,

495
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:23,000
the first four guys will lead guys,
they have a mission.

496
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,480
One guy gets to the door.
If there's a shooting,

497
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,750
the other guy ducked.
Two guys buck for the president.

498
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,890
There's got to be planned.
It's like formations and football tunes.

499
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,780
What if the line back,
it goes this way,

500
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:40,781
you want around me,
just take a fucking genius to tell you 

501
00:26:40,781 --> 00:26:44,530
there has to be formation to protect the
president or whoever it is you're 

502
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:44,820
protecting and that level.

503
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:50,390
When I'm protecting Kevin Hart,
how many people are going to try to 

504
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:54,081
assassinate Kevin Hart when I'm 
protecting our president?

505
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:00,960
How many people are going to really try 
to shoot that precedent with weapons?

506
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,660
I mean,
let's go to the Ronald Reagan attempt.

507
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,210
Let's go to these attempts.
How fucking fast this is.

508
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,710
You have to be so high.
He leapt Vietnam,

509
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,200
another war,
and then you had to do a tour with 

510
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,200
something else where you would just like
the sport.

511
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,560
You tiptoed in chilled people with 
toothpicks and shit.

512
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,020
This is my dream.
This is what I think the training you.

513
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,650
I will think you're just born to be 
Rambo.

514
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,750
I think they have to take you to the 
government and they start with a hundred

515
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:36,390
Rambo's.
They just keep training,

516
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:37,530
training,
training.

517
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,830
You'll lose some along the way and after
every hundred you get eight fucking 

518
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,200
savages that never had chance to get 
married.

519
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,110
The government never gave him a chance 
to get married.

520
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,590
They're that good.
Well,

521
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:56,010
all these guys that I know that have 
been navy seals,

522
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,100
all of them are any special forces guys.
Just you.

523
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,070
Those are different humans,
you know,

524
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,660
to Digitas,
different people,

525
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,320
but what's Jocko navy seal.
Okay.

526
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,620
So in that.
Yeah.

527
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,800
And um,
just just a level that you have to be,

528
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,710
you have to have more control over your 
mind,

529
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,460
more control over your will,
more control over your discipline.

530
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:28,670
You're,
you're in the most elite branch of the 

531
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:28,670
military.
I mean,

532
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,800
this is the elite of the elite money.
Make it insanely difficult to get in.

533
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:37,010
So you just get the cream of the crops.
The people who are they just a mental 

534
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:41,610
fortitude is just unlike an average 
person.

535
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,280
If you meet a bunch of people like that,
man,

536
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,960
you realized like,
wow,

537
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:50,210
people come in all kinds of different 
levels.

538
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,160
There's people that just only surround 
themselves with other excellence

539
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:00,770
and those dudes like those Jocko type 
dudes or Tim Kennedy type dudes,

540
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:06,460
those different kinds of human like you,
they don't make a lot of those.

541
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,990
You just want to have only those boy,
you gotta.

542
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:15,890
There's a lot that has to happen before 
you can become a person like that.

543
00:29:15,891 --> 00:29:20,891
You have to,
you have to travel through many valleys 

544
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:24,880
of the mind.
And the body to get to be a person like 

545
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,620
that,
a person have a insane resolve in a time

546
00:29:27,621 --> 00:29:30,230
of war.
It's a very,

547
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:33,730
very intense human being.
It's not even a time a war.

548
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:37,290
Look at these 12 Filipino kids in the 
fucking back caves down there.

549
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,940
Local went to get them to fucking seals.
The.

550
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,070
The seal team

551
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,140
went down that that would happen.
Well,

552
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:48,300
there's different various agencies,
but there's also a seal team there.

553
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,830
Makes Sense.
You know the seal team that that's his 

554
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,100
elite elite.
So why do you.

555
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,070
I don't even know.
That's how you probably become a fucking

556
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:05,250
a bodyguard to the president.
You'd have to fucking start like as an 

557
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,600
attache somewhere for a year or two with
a suit on.

558
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,950
Just to adjust to human life and life 
without fucking Aaron bombs.

559
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:16,951
Go off every 20 minutes and shit and 
then move up in that system until you 

560
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:19,510
get to that level,
the secret service.

561
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,810
There's no way you're going to be a 
sick.

562
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:27,811
They put you to the secret service 
training school and you're there in 60 

563
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:27,820
days.
Let me tell you something.

564
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,990
I got my daughter goes to science camp,
you know,

565
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:36,370
whatever the fuck until pre k starts.
I'm one of the kids.

566
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,020
She goes to his dad's an FBI agent,
so you know,

567
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:43,870
my job is everyday to sneak up on them 
everyday.

568
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,010
Snake upon put a gun to his side,
like what's going on?

569
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,290
Pat Them in the back and he giggles and 
shit.

570
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:54,310
I taught my wife everyday.
He's the worst FBI agent I've ever seen 

571
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,270
in my life because I'm too lazy.
Tiptoeing up to him.

572
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:58,330
He don't even hear me in bushes and 
that's how good I am.

573
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,630
Do you know why though?
Because they admire them.

574
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,510
Random and academy today.
Joe Rogan rather the college.

575
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,250
That's why we have so many shootings.
That's why we have so many accidents out

576
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:13,390
there were police officers.
They don't hire enabled kids anymore.

577
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,500
They hire college graduates that have 
never had what we had seen when you were

578
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:22,030
growing up,
if all else failed,

579
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,050
you've never been arrested in your life.
You really could have been a cop.

580
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,660
You're a nice guy,
but you really could have been killed.

581
00:31:29,661 --> 00:31:34,661
A cop.
You could have been joe the cop in 

582
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:37,560
Quincy,
mass that drives around and shit like 

583
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:37,560
that.
Sure.

584
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,020
Anybody could be.
Anybody could be a class,

585
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,320
but joe,
the cop would have been different if 

586
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,320
Joe,
the cop would've came in here and see me

587
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,870
and Jamie argue joe the cop wouldn't 
arrest me and Jamie,

588
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:47,830
Joe,
the cop would say,

589
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:49,370
I want to meet you motherfuckers 
tomorrow.

590
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:54,460
Retreat will give us both boxing gloves 
and we would box so that when we were 12

591
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:57,040
and both go home and get ice cream the 
next day joe,

592
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,870
the cop wouldn't throw.
It was both in jail.

593
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,510
Joe,
the cop wouldn't throw us against a wall

594
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,930
and if we turned around and shoot one of
us in the fucking leg,

595
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,310
he was part of the community.
Joe The cop and Joe on the cop knew what

596
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:13,030
it was like living in that community as 
a child.

597
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,460
Do you understand me?
So,

598
00:32:15,461 --> 00:32:20,461
and I didn't know this.
I've been thinking about a lot of 

599
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:20,461
baptists and I ran into somebody and I 
asked them,

600
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,130
why are we having the situation we're 
having in this country?

601
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:29,370
The one last week and fucking East 
Pittsburgh is just mind blowing.

602
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:35,670
That motherfucker just now.
There's a lot of different angles for 

603
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,911
that.
They had just finished doing a shoot 

604
00:32:38,911 --> 00:32:40,020
out,
but the kid took off this cop watch them

605
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,440
said,
okay God down,

606
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:45,440
drop down military style.
Blast him three times.

607
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,600
Oh shoot me in the leg,
bitch.

608
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,680
Shoot me in the leg for running away.
That's what joe the cop would do.

609
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,020
Yeah,
but even shooting someone in the leg 

610
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,020
away,
what you get,

611
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,260
it's got to be something that they did.
That's really fucked up.

612
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Well listen,
I believe that she showed me some of 

613
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:02,440
them.
Take your fucking life.

614
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,480
I hear Ya.
I'd rather shoot you in the leg then 

615
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,750
take your life if it's an iffy call,
but just so you know,

616
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,880
it's not safe to shoot someone in the 
leg.

617
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,420
People die from getting shot in the left
ankle.

618
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,410
No.
Okay,

619
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:20,411
but I'm just mentioning the risk.
I don't want to give anybody the 

620
00:33:20,411 --> 00:33:20,411
impression they can just go around 
shooting people.

621
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,840
How many movies did we grow up,
but then the guy got shot in the 

622
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:25,840
shoulder.

623
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,810
We just went,
you live getting show miss shaver.

624
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:32,850
It is.
They get pistol whipped and then when 

625
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:32,850
they wake up it's like nothing happened.
They just start duking it out.

626
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,640
They got pistol whipped.
Everybody was pistol whipping.

627
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,650
People remember that.
They would club them in the head with 

628
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:41,990
the pistol.
That was so crazy.

629
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,710
That was like a thing and then these 
people will wake up.

630
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:47,420
Why?
What happened?

631
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:52,421
I didn't get pistol whipped with the but
I got pistol whipped with the gun to the

632
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:56,390
head.
Nothing blood,

633
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,460
thank God,
but if fucking hurt,

634
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,390
I don't know what the fuck type of gun.
It was like an automatic,

635
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:04,650
like a,
like a nine millimeter tighten.

636
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:09,710
It wasn't like a revolver.
I never got hit with the bud or what a 

637
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,250
weird feature of the human body.
If you hit it in the right spots,

638
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:16,820
it goes out.
We have like a plug.

639
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,460
We have like a loser,
like some people's plugs.

640
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:22,700
A little looser than others.
Some people's plugs like Mark Hunt.

641
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,510
It takes forever to knock it loose.
Some people could just take it,

642
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:29,760
some people can't.
It's fucking weird.

643
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,700
So weird characteristic hit people.
And they go unconscious.

644
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:39,130
It's very strange.
It's very strange feature that we 

645
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:41,700
exploit,
you know,

646
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,970
but movies,
they always make it like it's no big 

647
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:47,970
deal.
It's a big fucking deal.

648
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,410
It's a big deal.
You should avoid having it done to you.

649
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,560
It's a big deal to get knocked 
unconscious.

650
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,370
You know,
it's so weird.

651
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,380
When we first started hanging out one 
afternoon,

652
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,280
you took me to see that boxing coach at 
the time he had four academy award.

653
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:11,381
God as he was training.
Was that Terry Clay Bond try reclaimed 

654
00:35:11,381 --> 00:35:12,410
Monteith.
Terry's amazing.

655
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,070
He's a great guy.
We walked in there,

656
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,310
we went upstairs and I,
I think uh,

657
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,050
at the time when we walked the Nicholas 
cage is up there at the time,

658
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,880
was a piece on his shit at the bar and 
stuff.

659
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:30,881
And then Terry came over and gave you a 
hug and we went downstairs and tyree 

660
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,090
grab Steve Simone later on because Steve
worked there at the time.

661
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,600
This is 97,
98 as a gym.

662
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,660
And he goes,
boy,

663
00:35:39,661 --> 00:35:41,770
that guy's in the wrong profession.
As a comic,

664
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:43,950
he should've been a boxy.
It's like a meal,

665
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,980
you know.
And I never forgot that him saying that 

666
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,510
and all the stuff you talk about brain 
damage and and whatever,

667
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,800
it took a lot for you that at that age 
to realize that this was fucking for 

668
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,430
real.
This was,

669
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,610
this was dangerous.
There was no money in it.

670
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,310
There was no temptation.
This head,

671
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,780
this head shit is not.
This is real.

672
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,800
It was real.
But it was also a.

673
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:11,590
I didn't have any temptation.
Now what happened before this?

674
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Like what happened to the guys that I 
saw playing football and black and white

675
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:18,400
with leather helmets.
Well,

676
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:19,750
you know,
leather helmets are safer,

677
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,570
believe it or not because you don't feel
as confident.

678
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,420
When they had those leather helmets,
it didn't crash into each other the same

679
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:27,000
way.
There's a,

680
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:32,310
there's a opinion.
I don't know if I agree with it because 

681
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,640
I don't know much about the sport,
but there's an opinion that no pads,

682
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,940
no helmets,
football would be safer because you 

683
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:38,940
wouldn't be able to do the same things 
that they're doing now.

684
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,020
You can't just run into people head to 
head.

685
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:44,830
You just just destroy you and you can 
only do it a few times.

686
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:49,830
Your body will start breaking,
but if you're putting helmets on and 

687
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,131
pads,
it accentuates your ability to run into 

688
00:36:53,131 --> 00:36:56,310
someone with all your force that's 
unnatural and it creates an unnatural 

689
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,500
jarring of the body and the brain that 
the rugby guys don't get.

690
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,840
The rugby guys don't have all those 
paths,

691
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,940
so when they're clashing into each 
other,

692
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,230
they're learning how to roll with things
and not just colliding into each other.

693
00:37:08,231 --> 00:37:10,720
They're not.
There's a different game when you've got

694
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,910
padding,
so if you take away the padding,

695
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:17,110
people have to be more careful and how 
they're engaged.

696
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:19,270
They can't just charge in and smash into
each other.

697
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,420
They won't last.
I always cte the game context sport for 

698
00:37:25,331 --> 00:37:27,640
sure.
Getting banged up.

699
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:31,690
It's a contact sport context.
Are there any.

700
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,290
Don't know.
Interesting fun though.

701
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,670
I remember being a kid.
I'm from New Jersey.

702
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,320
It's a real good question.
And fucking Jersey,

703
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:38,770
right?
Yeah,

704
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,940
we know football.
I didn't even go to soccer back then 

705
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,950
when I lived in Jersey through soccer's 
a couple of Spanish people,

706
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:49,660
played the dark side of the court.
It played soccer on Sundays.

707
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:51,090
They will even let.
Nobody wants me,

708
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,410
a couple of Spanish guys.
But besides that,

709
00:37:53,411 --> 00:37:54,240
soccer was not

710
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,820
begging my area.
But uh,

711
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:02,050
when I moved to Aspen I would go to the 
hospital on Saturday just to walk around

712
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:05,300
and get a big of the sandwich and I'd 
see rugby.

713
00:38:05,301 --> 00:38:10,301
I had never saw that.
I didn't even know what the fuck it was 

714
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:10,301
and I was like,
I'm in good shape.

715
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,180
And after about three times I went,
one of the guys at I want you to show up

716
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,540
on a fucking Saturday.
And I looked at them like,

717
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:19,750
what are you crazy?
Like,

718
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:21,620
I don't even know what the fuck you guys
are doing.

719
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,980
They have a big rug rug fest in Aspen 
every year,

720
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,850
pretty much every year.
That's where I first saw rugby was in 

721
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:30,850
Colorado.

722
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,780
I don't think you've ever seen it live.
I've only seen it on TV.

723
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,990
No,
I've seen it live,

724
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,860
but it's,
you know,

725
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:42,190
I saw three,
I saw two things that blew me away live 

726
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,611
and in Colorado I saw rugby and I saw 
when they did like a tour de France star

727
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:51,090
type race,
but they did it sludge snowmass village 

728
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:55,000
and I knew exactly what it was the road 
up and how we would have to be a circle 

729
00:38:55,181 --> 00:39:00,181
to go by and you didn't have to go back 
down to rule to would just do circles 

730
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:03,820
around snowmass and I still remember 
being on a hill,

731
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:09,510
listening to them going up the hill and 
it just blew my fucking mind the way the

732
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:16,801
tire was hitting the speeds,
like how fast they were going uphill and

733
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:23,341
then 20 years later you realize that 
doing ppo and fucked and hanging out 

734
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:26,320
with Sheryl Crow's though husband 
shooting all that shit.

735
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,870
Can you imagine when they were shooting 
in the eighties when I saw him,

736
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:34,100
Jesus was shit stronger back then.
I can only imagine what's the drug that 

737
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:37,120
they shoot at.
The legs won't stop moving at night.

738
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:39,220
So they got a gun on a bicycle.
Oh,

739
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,750
epo.
It's not the delay,

740
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,910
the blood gets thick apparently,
I'm probably saying it wrong,

741
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,120
but uh,
they have this feeling like they have to

742
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:54,121
exercise.
One of our buddies was a biker and you 

743
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:56,380
know,
he was professional tour guide,

744
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,460
just like,
you know,

745
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,220
not like a super famous super successful
one,

746
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:05,221
but he was a professional bike rider.
What would you call one of those 

747
00:40:05,221 --> 00:40:05,380
cyclists?
Professional cyclists.

748
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,290
And he would tell us about it,
how guys you'd hear them.

749
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,320
He knew that they were on epo and then 
you would hear them when they were on a 

750
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,380
tour bus.
They'd get up in the middle of the night

751
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:15,220
and go ride their bike.

752
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,100
Like they felt like they had to 
exercise.

753
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:22,250
So I guess if you're on a lot of it,
I don't know,

754
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,840
I've never done it.
It seems like it would be awesome 

755
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,051
though,
if you could take some drug that like 

756
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:32,230
super juiced up your endurance.
That sounds awesome.

757
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:37,330
But apparently it's just not very safe.
And there were saying that um,

758
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,990
a lot of executives take it now.
Like there's,

759
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
there's people that are executives that 
are just entering endurance races and 

760
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:52,171
they're taking epo and entering into 
these endurance races that like regular 

761
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:55,470
people with regular jobs just decided to
take it.

762
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,930
There was some article about that,
see if he could find it.

763
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,800
It was like Ceos,
uh,

764
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:07,450
entering into an endurance races taking 
epo,

765
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:12,570
but it's a few fighters.
I'm been caught with it and it 

766
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,200
apparently just really juices up your 
urine.

767
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,250
You go 16 rounds instead of fucking type
shit.

768
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Yeah.
I had a friend that used to shoot me 

769
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,450
steroids and never do a pushup.
Jesus Christ,

770
00:41:24,451 --> 00:41:26,730
he was whacked.
That's crazy dog.

771
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,750
When are you going to go to the gym?
Next week?

772
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:35,030
That's same.
I'll never forget seeing him eat like 

773
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,030
half a bottle

774
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,470
of Winnie v,
the pink football.

775
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:39,320
Like the pink ones in the eighties.
He would just put them into this.

776
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:40,370
I'm like,
pick the X.

777
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:44,150
would it be a Oh my God,
tomorrow did some pushups today.

778
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,830
Just my biceps.
That's all I need.

779
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:50,831
A few biceps.
A talions crazy group of humans that 

780
00:41:57,411 --> 00:42:00,230
came out of always wanting you to do the
impersonation from you.

781
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:03,150
When the Italian people in Jersey.
From that,

782
00:42:03,151 --> 00:42:04,760
that Marlon Brando is gay.

783
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:14,040
I can't fucking believe in 20 years he 
was the godfather and no,

784
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:14,640
no,
no.

785
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,770
He couldn't blow a regular dude.
No.

786
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,800
God forbid he blows a black dude really 
stabbed me right here and the fuck they 

787
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,490
lot.
I couldn't even take it no more.

788
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,840
I had to throw the DVD collection away 
and fucking.

789
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,930
I would love to hear one of those guys.
What they said.

790
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,000
They found that,
that that week,

791
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,920
didn't they say that he fucked 
everybody?

792
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,630
Men and women.
He banged.

793
00:42:36,631 --> 00:42:38,040
Everybody fucked everybody.
Yeah,

794
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,710
and then it came out.
He was banging the guy with the big Dick

795
00:42:40,711 --> 00:42:42,560
and cube.
That's right.

796
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:47,280
Superman.
That's so fucking poor Italian people.

797
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:52,281
If that godfather fans,
they will lighten those fucking dvds on 

798
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:52,770
five.
Fuck.

799
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:54,190
Marlon Brando.
Poor.

800
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:58,290
Poor homophobes.
I like them more now.

801
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,440
I like Marlon Brando Brando.
Yeah.

802
00:43:01,441 --> 00:43:05,450
I don't give a fuck.
I don't listen to me.

803
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,460
Richard.
Prior to thinking about Richard Pryor 

804
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,051
getting so coked up that he lit Marlon 
Brando fucker was one of the things I 

805
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:13,320
was like,
unless he that's prejudice with me,

806
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:18,321
I should just assume he enjoyed it and I
assume he enjoyed having sex with a 

807
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:18,930
brand.
Why should I give a shit?

808
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,970
Listen to the first number one thing,

809
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,370
because you're going to die when I tell 
you this.

810
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,140
Oh,
Marlin Brando.

811
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,030
Talk to studio and to give them like 100
grand to read superman.

812
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,230
Like you know when people call you up 
Joe.

813
00:43:34,231 --> 00:43:36,940
Hi Joe.
This is Cynthia from your agents,

814
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,100
right?
We're sending you a script over to 

815
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:42,100
approved to read.

816
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:42,760
Yeah,
hundred grand.

817
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,320
Give me a hundred grand and I'll reduce 
it because he went to the island.

818
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,770
He went deep and he believed his ego.
You got to remember that was an all time

819
00:43:49,771 --> 00:43:52,130
record for a long time.
When he got Super Mad,

820
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,870
he banged him out.
He took them to the cleanest time.

821
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,790
Shoot him.
He fucked them up in the ass.

822
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,820
Bad.
My big find that what they pay them in 

823
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,791
1970 whatever for Superman member,
he fucked them big time.

824
00:44:07,891 --> 00:44:12,891
Um,
I think it's mutiny on the bounty and 

825
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:12,891
one of those movies they kept saying,
Oh,

826
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:16,420
we have a beautiful spot for you right 
here in little marina though,

827
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:18,450
right?
If we do this,

828
00:44:18,451 --> 00:44:20,220
we'll do this on this island.
My phone,

829
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,450
he had gone down there from La.
He's like,

830
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:27,451
there's a bunch of running around.
There's a bunch of women running around 

831
00:44:27,451 --> 00:44:27,451
with leaves on it.
No damage.

832
00:44:27,451 --> 00:44:27,451
I didn't do that.

833
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,100
He made the studio shoot down there then
and then went down there.

834
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,500
Who wants to go to the fucking?
Whatever island they shot that.

835
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,090
So that's where he lived.
Right.

836
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,280
So he went down there,
he got down and he's like,

837
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:43,281
Jamie,
which your job pa no more either 

838
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:43,560
director Rogan,
you're this.

839
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:45,750
And everybody was shooting.
They were shooting his feet.

840
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:52,160
They were shooting him rotten and like 
the shore and meanwhile he was just 

841
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:55,680
banging fucking Hawaiian when either the
time this happened.

842
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,740
Oh,
gas bagging kids.

843
00:44:57,741 --> 00:45:00,940
All those kids that shop themselves,
all those kids he had no more.

844
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh my God,
those poor kids that fucking God rest 

845
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,201
his soul that all those problems he had,
he was down there like fucking just 

846
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:13,380
matador and whatever paramont whether 
the network was showed up,

847
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:16,110
down and so let's see the dailies and 
said,

848
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:17,310
what the fuck is this?

849
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,630
You're done.
They brought somebody else in.

850
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:22,020
Malden ended up saying,
fuck it,

851
00:45:22,021 --> 00:45:24,720
I'll buy the island he bought the 
island.

852
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,700
Didn't need like,
this is just crazy shit.

853
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:31,701
I heard over the years and they just 
lived on the island and then if they 

854
00:45:31,701 --> 00:45:35,691
wanted to have a quality island and they
have like levels or you want me to read 

855
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:35,980
the script?
That's what,

856
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,270
of course she had.
Oh you want me to come to the studio?

857
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:44,300
That's $300,000.
But he had levels of fucking and they 

858
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:44,300
would give it to them.
They will.

859
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,260
And then they didn't want him for the 
Godfather.

860
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,460
They were like,
Nah,

861
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,340
there's no way we want that fucking guy.
Wow.

862
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,610
And then finally he put the tape in his 
mouth and all that shit.

863
00:45:53,611 --> 00:45:58,611
And they approved them and he didn't 
know that movies like a point to one.

864
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:04,311
He did that last tango in Paris isn't,
that's like a light porn and then the 

865
00:46:04,501 --> 00:46:05,190
chick came out.

866
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,560
He just laid there and said that 
motherfucker stone cold rape me.

867
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,320
He.
Yeah,

868
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:13,860
he was the king of me too.
He invented me too.

869
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:16,590
That motherfucker dog.
Wow.

870
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:22,570
Yeah.
She came out years later and said 

871
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,411
something about she didn't know what 
Marlon Brando went in there and choked 

872
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:29,550
her out like mcqueen and fucking and the
getaway.

873
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,580
She thought she was just getting pushed.
You had the mcqueen and who was with 

874
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,110
him?
That was hard to watch,

875
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:39,960
Dude,
because you could tell that was real.

876
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:45,110
There's no way that wasn't real.
Like he was really hitting her and let 

877
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:49,100
her know he was a method actor is harsh.
He's crazy.

878
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,980
He was crazy.
Scene was so real because of it.

879
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:58,560
I mean it's awful to watch but.
But it's real,

880
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:02,400
right?
It's an awful scene.

881
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:07,670
It's real fuck man.
That you imagine being her and all of a 

882
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:09,570
sudden that do just start smacking you 
in the head for real.

883
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,630
You don't know what to do and you don't 
want to bail out of the scene.

884
00:47:12,631 --> 00:47:16,890
You're getting fucked up though.
He fucking you up and she didn't stop.

885
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,950
She just kept saying the lines and 
working with it.

886
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,910
Fuck Dude.
Jesus Christ.

887
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,460
What do you say to somebody after that 
game?

888
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,800
And I'm sorry,
but that's what the scene call for

889
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,720
you can't see out of peep for it sounds 
fucked up to say,

890
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:43,100
but I think even just that recent time,
people did not understand that if you're

891
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:48,780
smacking people in the head like that,
you're giving them fucking brain damage.

892
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,630
Like you smack someone in the head like 
that.

893
00:47:51,631 --> 00:47:56,631
Like you could seriously fucked them up.
Like something could be wrong with them 

894
00:47:56,631 --> 00:47:58,650
for a long time.
Even if they don't go unconscious.

895
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:01,010
Your mother is Maggie?
No,

896
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,110
no.
My mom wasn't a or really?

897
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:04,280
No,
she wasn't a head.

898
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:09,310
Which Matthew,
that very few people.

899
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,040
Uncle.
No,

900
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,280
very few people.
I'll tell you,

901
00:48:17,281 --> 00:48:19,110
it won't be my grandmother cracked me 
once,

902
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:20,340
but it was,
you know,

903
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,640
just like get your shit together.
Not like trying to hurt me,

904
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,530
you know,
just a little smack.

905
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:28,830
I didn't get beat as a kid.
But uh,

906
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:33,390
I saw a lot of violence.
I saw the scene violence when you were a

907
00:48:33,391 --> 00:48:38,391
kid.
There's something about like seeing 

908
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:41,450
someone you're close to who is an adult 
be beating up like a 10 or 11 year old.

909
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,170
You ever see that before?
When you see,

910
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,240
when you see somebody that you ever see 
a grown adult beaten the shit out of a 

911
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,130
10 or 11 year old when you're a little 
kid?

912
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,830
Yes.
That to me was.

913
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:03,700
That was like a defining moment when I 
was a little kid as a parent or I only 

914
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:06,210
show a parents beat the children.
Yeah.

915
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:11,220
I saw someone beat somebody else's kid.
It was fucked up to watch man

916
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,770
when I lived on 200,
five west,

917
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:16,530
88th street.
We can't.

918
00:49:16,531 --> 00:49:18,480
When I came from Cuba,
we live in New Jersey for him.

919
00:49:18,481 --> 00:49:23,310
My Dad died at 89th street.
Then something happened at the building.

920
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:28,380
We ended up moving to 88th street and 
they had a kid I had a beef with every 

921
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,050
day and one day I finally got my shit 
together and karate

922
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:38,260
like one day on my side kickstart at 
working and that fucking right cross 

923
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:42,671
started working to learn how to use my 
fucking block and I finally had this 

924
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:44,120
kid.
His name was rudy,

925
00:49:44,121 --> 00:49:49,121
the Haitian.
He was the only Haitian kid in the 

926
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:50,831
neighborhood.
We lived on 88th street and I fucked 

927
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:53,811
them up this day and his father came 
down and held my arms and he made rudy 

928
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,670
punched me and I'll never forget that my
lip was bleeding and he took me upstairs

929
00:49:58,671 --> 00:50:03,671
and knocked on my mother's door and my 
mother opened up the door and half a 

930
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:05,210
fucking angle and she goes,
what's the problem?

931
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,590
She goes out with Coco,
you know,

932
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,620
and he goes,
next time you sun hits my son,

933
00:50:09,621 --> 00:50:10,690
I'm going to hit him.
And I'm like,

934
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:15,691
come on you.
My mom turned around and got a butcher 

935
00:50:15,691 --> 00:50:17,900
knife and chased rudy's.
Fall up the stairs,

936
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,360
chops claim and the lady next door.

937
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:25,360
So she didn't see a knife,
but at that point we were done in the 

938
00:50:26,031 --> 00:50:27,500
building.
Geez.

939
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:32,560
That was one of the worse there.
When I moved to North Bergen,

940
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:39,040
I saw parents that you don't like.
You ever hear a comedian go hang out 

941
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:43,110
with white kids?
He wasn't a house.

942
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,510
How they talked to their parents.
I could never talk to about.

943
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,520
You know,
that's the first thing I noticed when I 

944
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:50,520
went to jersey,
there was,

945
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,370
there were certain kids that will take 
the addition go,

946
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,080
I don't want to fish sandwich.
If I ever did that in my house.

947
00:50:57,081 --> 00:51:01,670
Joe Rogan are you fucking kidding me?
My mom would take the dish,

948
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:07,530
throw it against the wall and say,
now you're not fucking eat and go to 

949
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:07,530
bed.
Like that type of shit.

950
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:12,311
But I also saw a fucking parent in the 
hallway one day I was standing in the 

951
00:51:12,311 --> 00:51:12,320
way.

952
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:17,320
You are with his arms crossed.
Torque them to the teacher the way I'm 

953
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:22,511
talking to you.
And a kid standing right here with 

954
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:24,290
glasses on.
And I'm walking towards him like,

955
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,320
you know,
I went to the bathroom and like a hall 

956
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,260
pass and I'm talking,
talking,

957
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:31,820
talking,
and in the middle of it,

958
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:36,821
the father just going back and hitting 
them with a backhand kick goes down,

959
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:38,940
glasses,
broken.

960
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:44,050
Blood's coming out of the nose.
Oh please tell them to get the fuck up 

961
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:45,450
before I fucking kill you.
You dumb mother fucker.

962
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,600
Oh,
you said that to him.

963
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:48,620
You dumb.
Fuck.

964
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,090
I have seen that.
Oh,

965
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,490
that kid was the devil.
I know that kid.

966
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:57,730
Well,
the reason why they can't get Kim's the 

967
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,711
devil probably because his dad beat him.
And then there was another kid when I 

968
00:51:59,711 --> 00:52:03,011
went to Catholic school,
we know Father Ginzo the whole fucking 

969
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:04,820
thing,
bro.

970
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,990
He would come that the nicest guy in the
world.

971
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,520
But the sun was fucking crazy.
And every time he get there,

972
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,140
the nun would tell him about what he did
and dog.

973
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:20,900
He would punch him the way.

974
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:27,420
Old Guy always throwing punches.
Guy fucking Steve Bay.

975
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:33,230
I switched rooms.
Was griff right as he was crawling into 

976
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:35,060
the car like a frown.
Pounded them 12.

977
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,450
Jesus,
I got thrown out of that 11.

978
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:44,050
So now are you looking at me saying Joey
did they deserve it or whatever.

979
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,870
Everybody,
every parent had a different,

980
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:48,440
uh,
you know,

981
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:53,441
I watched a couple of weeks ago I was 
stung to the gills and I was laughing 

982
00:52:53,441 --> 00:52:55,430
about how people put people down and 
shit.

983
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:00,830
And I was laughing about when Julia 
serving first when the Aba shut down,

984
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,320
when the Aba for a shut down,
if they were,

985
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,570
I don't know Joe,
but if there was eight categories,

986
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:10,900
Julius Irving's lead seminars and the 
Aba shut down and the six is picked up.

987
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,870
Julia serving.
They gave him $6,000,000,

988
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,180
which can you imagine that?
What would they give that guy yet?

989
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:21,560
What they give Le Bron?
Ron's getting about 30 or 40,

990
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:26,010
but yet he got $6,000,000
over two years or that was Julius and

991
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,210
he was the biggest play in the world 
that now this guy's getting 1:54

992
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:35,070
for three cheeses.
So Dr Jay switches number from 32 to six

993
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,580
and now the NBA All star game came.
So all the critics were like,

994
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,210
he came from the Aba,
he's gonna,

995
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:46,810
get his ass kicked in the NBA All star 
game.

996
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,810
What?
Go look at those statistics.

997
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:54,140
He went off,
he went off because I'm a white dude 

998
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,590
named Pistol Pete Maravich.
That is.

999
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,840
He went to Lsu and lead the country in 
scoring a white dude and ended up 

1000
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,791
becoming a fucking booze about that dude
knew how to handle the ball because his 

1001
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:09,771
father would beat him.
His father would make him sleep in the 

1002
00:54:09,771 --> 00:54:12,951
garage and the winter and beat him until
he learned how to play basketball 

1003
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:14,460
because there was no losing in this 
fucking house.

1004
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:15,750
Do you understand me,
Joe Rogan?

1005
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:19,800
No.
Fucking my fucking house.

1006
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,600
Sleep in the garage.
No data pistol.

1007
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:27,630
Pete knew how to dribble jacket with a 
pistol.

1008
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,060
Pete would take you deep pistol.
Pete can.

1009
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:35,210
Anybody could cover by the best black 
dude in the league and cover pistol 

1010
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:39,021
pete.
But if you watch the NBA All star Game 

1011
00:54:39,021 --> 00:54:42,720
Pistol Pete stomping chomping people and
give them behind the back passes to 

1012
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,060
Julius Irving.
He even looks at a do a one path.

1013
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,400
He's looking at Bob Mcadoo.
I'm coming,

1014
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,560
I don't think just puts the ball between
his legs and he gives it to Julia 

1015
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:52,590
serving.
Why?

1016
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,660
Because that kid's father stayed on.

1017
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:59,390
There's different thoughts of some 
people can handle that.

1018
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,270
Some people have to like some.
Some guys are broken,

1019
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:07,420
but I mean it's like how much pressure 
is too much pressure to create like a 

1020
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,270
superstar like that.
I didn't.

1021
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:13,271
Tiger Woods didn't.
His Dad put a lot of pressure on him as 

1022
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:13,271
well.
It was.

1023
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:15,110
Now let's talk about the.
The guy that died last week,

1024
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,180
but that's a different thing I can tell.
Well,

1025
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,620
the tiger woods,
Joe Jackson.

1026
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
What the fuck is different about that?
He created three fucking kids that 

1027
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,730
changed the fucking one kid that change 
the fucking world.

1028
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,680
He beat on me.
Fuck them in the ass.

1029
00:55:27,681 --> 00:55:29,790
Opposed to.
I don't know.

1030
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,240
He did sexual assault.
One.

1031
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,240
Got To be really careful with the same 
things.

1032
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,610
I'm sorry.
Listen this to me.

1033
00:55:34,611 --> 00:55:35,840
Two things.
Things come out.

1034
00:55:35,841 --> 00:55:40,841
What are you going to do?
Everybody's getting the blame for 

1035
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:40,841
something.
You know what I'm saying?

1036
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:43,930
But this is something you really heard.
I have heard sexual abuse allegations 

1037
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:44,380
from his father,
but,

1038
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,420
but I listen to what,
listen to what did he create,

1039
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:53,470
what do they do?
What did Joe Jackson do by making them 

1040
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:56,210
not letting them fucking and,
and let me tell you something to one kid

1041
00:55:56,211 --> 00:55:58,490
could have gone to a college to play 
basketball.

1042
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,200
The kids had talent as it was gary,
Indiana ever go to carry and then.

1043
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,970
No,
it's like hell

1044
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,970
a fucking Delaware.
And then Gary,

1045
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:11,430
Indiana,
like,

1046
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,860
you know what I'm saying?
Like Gary's like crazy.

1047
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,460
He made these kids for her.
She pulled them out of Gary,

1048
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,380
took him up to fucking Berry Gordy,

1049
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,340
you know,
you think about this shit.

1050
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:27,330
Some of them probably hated him for what
he did.

1051
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:31,090
You look back at those lessons that you 
got Joe Rogan.

1052
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:33,580
How many people did you look at one day 
and go,

1053
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:38,581
fuck you motherfucker.
But then two years later you look back 

1054
00:56:38,581 --> 00:56:43,051
and you look at the lesson you learned 
from the whole experience and you 

1055
00:56:43,051 --> 00:56:44,320
actually have to go back and hug that 
person and go,

1056
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:46,720
hey man,
thank you for that time.

1057
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:51,990
It made me better motherfucker tonight.
Because what you did made me a better 

1058
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:55,990
person will have to agree with 
everything that happens along the way.

1059
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,390
Joe wrote,
but it's maintenance.

1060
00:56:58,391 --> 00:56:59,740
Who the fuck we are today?

1061
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:05,370
That's an interesting thing because we 
grew up in a time where kids were just 

1062
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:08,950
allowed to run around outside.
Everybody ran around outside.

1063
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,170
That was just normal.
Right.

1064
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:14,050
When you were a little kid,
you ran around outside.

1065
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,920
Nobody just runs around outside.
I remember the first time I saw a grown 

1066
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,920
lady hit.
She hit my cousin.

1067
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:26,890
We were both around the same age.
I was probably six and she was five and 

1068
00:57:28,751 --> 00:57:33,751
this lady slipped on ice in front of her
apartment building and she got up and my

1069
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:39,961
cousin just unfortunately happened to be
standing right in front of her when she 

1070
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:41,110
fell and she got up and she said,
don't you laugh at me?

1071
00:57:41,111 --> 00:57:44,530
And she smacked her in the face.
She wasn't laughing at her either.

1072
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:47,770
Just she smashed her in the face,
man like it was.

1073
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,920
She smacked her hard and I was like,
oh my God.

1074
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:56,820
Was that we were both little,
little kids and watching some grown 

1075
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,240
adults smash our cousin in the face real
like

1076
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,160
like,
hey,

1077
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,970
you can't you,
you know,

1078
00:58:05,971 --> 00:58:10,971
you gotta be polite.
There's some fucking people that was 

1079
00:58:10,971 --> 00:58:11,400
smack you in the face and she didn't 
even do anything wrong.

1080
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,720
Here's some evil fuckers out there 
that'll hit little kids.

1081
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:21,210
That's a dark shit man.
Smack and little kids in the face.

1082
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:27,320
I swear to God.
I read into probably when I first moved 

1083
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:27,990
from Cuba,
but to Ada street,

1084
00:58:27,991 --> 00:58:32,991
there was a dude on the block that would
smack the little kids and I'm telling 

1085
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:36,261
you right now to my little daughter that
was words on the street that he would 

1086
00:58:36,261 --> 00:58:37,530
take it through his house and fuck you 
the ass.

1087
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:42,800
Oh my goodness.
That is that early 70 [inaudible].

1088
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:51,650
This was the early seventies,
which I turned into a joke later on 

1089
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:52,400
because it would be like,
Bro,

1090
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,620
have you seen Joe Rogan lately?
I haven't seen them in a week.

1091
00:58:56,430 --> 00:59:00,510
Sticky Charlie go like,
what was his name?

1092
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,600
Mr Martinez.
Mr Martinez the Martini Guy.

1093
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,840
Like when you first moved to 88th 
street.

1094
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,180
That's the first and the kid to tell you
like,

1095
00:59:09,181 --> 00:59:11,290
I will you this guy.
Don't fuck them,

1096
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:12,190
Mr.
Martini.

1097
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,280
Oh Jesus.
He's a monster and it's nearby.

1098
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:18,090
Kenny wore a black suit with a white 
shirt and black shoes.

1099
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:23,100
His wife would die and he owned the 
building at Eighth Street in the middle 

1100
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:26,180
and he was angry and he would sweep and 
you know,

1101
00:59:26,181 --> 00:59:29,030
like when you were a kid and you stop in
front of somebody's house,

1102
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,650
he would always come out and go get the 
fuck outta here.

1103
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,130
You little fucking Douche bags.
Get the.

1104
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:35,150
And I was Cuban.

1105
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:40,180
I didn't understand the language.
I didn't really understand what he was 

1106
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:40,520
saying.
I understood the anger,

1107
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,360
but other than understanding the 
language and they will come out with a 

1108
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:46,360
broom,
get the fuck out of here.

1109
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,390
One day I realized I'm like,
this motherfucker wants to rock.

1110
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,540
So while my other friends didn't want to
fuck with him,

1111
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:55,541
I'm like,
we're going to fuck with this 

1112
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:56,651
motherfucker.
So all humans have at like one in front 

1113
00:59:56,651 --> 01:00:00,041
of their house and there's something 
that your mother's role is changing 

1114
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:00,041
every day.
Good luck.

1115
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:04,541
Statue.
And I would steal the change and bring 

1116
01:00:04,541 --> 01:00:04,541
it downstairs and I will look at the 
poor kids and I go,

1117
01:00:04,541 --> 01:00:06,440
come in,
if there's anything you want to call it.

1118
01:00:06,441 --> 01:00:07,220
And they would go,
yeah,

1119
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:10,280
we'll get a quarter.
I would take a quarter and throw it with

1120
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:11,420
Mr.
Martini lived.

1121
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:13,520
He lived like in a basement area.

1122
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:17,870
He ran the whole bit.
He'd be right there and he chased us.

1123
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:23,950
We'd go Mr Matine something like weaning
and fucking chases chases caught yet he 

1124
01:00:27,621 --> 01:00:31,460
would fucking hit you like 50 times.
But we fucked him up.

1125
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:36,490
We would fuck him up dog.
I saw some shit the first day like New 

1126
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,020
Jersey to me.
Was it completely?

1127
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:44,090
That was like Mars to most people,
like most people listening to me and go,

1128
01:00:44,091 --> 01:00:46,340
you grew up someplace that doesn't 
exist.

1129
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:49,910
I'll bring eight people,
throw these chairs to tell you about the

1130
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:52,490
parents and the people and the 
situations.

1131
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,220
But the first day I went out in my 
hometown,

1132
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:58,850
I'm up Bergen.
I saw me and Joe Rogan fight.

1133
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,510
And even though I had Joe Rogan on his 
back,

1134
01:01:02,511 --> 01:01:04,940
I saw Joe Rogan's father come down the 
stairs.

1135
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,660
Pulled me off.
Joe Rogan smack me,

1136
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,500
punched me.
He kicked me,

1137
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:11,690
throw me on the floor and make this kid 
go in.

1138
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,080
That was my first experience ever.
North Bergen,

1139
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:18,740
New Jersey.
I saw Mr Robson come downstairs.

1140
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,920
He took anthony off.
His son drew him off.

1141
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:26,970
She smacked him in the fucking face.
Joe Rogan had two half after fucking 

1142
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:31,211
noon in 90 degree.
He punched him in the stomach and told 

1143
01:01:31,211 --> 01:01:31,340
them to go home.
You Little Guinea,

1144
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,430
fuck,
go home.

1145
01:01:34,431 --> 01:01:35,870
You Little Guinea.
Fuck.

1146
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:38,600
Say that now they'll throw you in jail 
for two years.

1147
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:39,830
He told them,
go home,

1148
01:01:39,831 --> 01:01:40,760
you go to Guinea.
Fuck.

1149
01:01:40,761 --> 01:01:42,800
And Anthony looked at him crying a 
little bit.

1150
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:45,260
He picked up his shirt.
He went like this,

1151
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:50,470
like he took the thing off.
I think it was unclear on my fucking 

1152
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:50,470
father.
You're fucking dead.

1153
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:54,821
Motherfucker.
Call Your fucking Guinea fucking 

1154
01:01:54,821 --> 01:01:54,821
greaseball father.
God I,

1155
01:01:54,821 --> 01:01:56,720
he's probably a grease ball just like 
you.

1156
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,230
And I'm sitting there going,
I want to see how this plays out.

1157
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:06,770
And next thing you know,
two cop cars pull up and it's one cop 

1158
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:06,920
car that's unmarked.

1159
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:11,980
It's another one that's marked and it's 
a big fucking Italian looking detective 

1160
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:16,860
like you know the,
the short stumpy paddling and he comes 

1161
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:17,510
out of his car.
He puts his fucking jacket on.

1162
01:02:17,511 --> 01:02:22,511
It barely fits,
but till this day I remember the more 

1163
01:02:22,511 --> 01:02:23,070
the dowels he had on his hand and he 
goes,

1164
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:24,630
what the fuck's going on here?
Kids?

1165
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,750
And the little Italian kid completely 
goes missing the fucking Mr.

1166
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,330
Robinson came down and he fucking smack 
me in the face.

1167
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:35,600
These are my witnesses.
Then he fucking hit me and I'm sitting 

1168
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:35,600
there going,
oh,

1169
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,490
this is going to get fucking good.
Then next thing you know the,

1170
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:42,270
the fucking cop,
the detective tells the cop,

1171
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,700
go look around and see if there's 
tickets.

1172
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,150
Go spread tickets.
And he goes,

1173
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:49,620
where's the sky live?
And he goes,

1174
01:02:49,621 --> 01:02:50,130
yeah.
And he goes,

1175
01:02:50,131 --> 01:02:52,230
and he grabbed all the other kids and he
goes,

1176
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,130
tell me what happened.

1177
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:58,580
And he goes,
anthony and him were fighting and he 

1178
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,861
came down here and he fucking pulled him
and that this time they know that the 

1179
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:01,800
cops are there.
And Mr Robson,

1180
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,170
I kind of opened this door to be kind of
tough,

1181
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:10,190
like he's not coming up where he's on 
the normal fucking knock came up to and 

1182
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:10,260
the cop goes,
okay,

1183
01:03:10,261 --> 01:03:11,070
okay,
okay.

1184
01:03:11,071 --> 01:03:12,750
And he grabbed the kid and he goes,
you're okay,

1185
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:13,340
right?
Yeah.

1186
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:18,890
And he goes,
he just hit me in the face and he 

1187
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:18,890
fucking walked up the stairs.
Brown took come five minutes,

1188
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:23,040
got to the top thing.
I opened the fucking door.

1189
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,560
Joe Rogan.
This guy will put his hand.

1190
01:03:25,561 --> 01:03:30,561
Then he pulled the fucking put them 
against the fucking thing on the second 

1191
01:03:32,071 --> 01:03:35,550
floor with everybody out and just 
started punching him,

1192
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,480
punching him,
punching him like fucking John June.

1193
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:43,770
It's one of these,
got you're down.

1194
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:48,780
He's hitting you with those shots to the
head until the guy killed over and they 

1195
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:49,500
started kicking him with the fucking 
thing.

1196
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,030
Bam,
Bam,

1197
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:52,770
Bam.
And he goes,

1198
01:03:52,771 --> 01:03:55,740
don't you ever fucking hit my son again?
Let's get outta here.

1199
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:01,660
Or that was how I became friends with 
the family because as soon as he came 

1200
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:01,950
down,
he goes,

1201
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:03,060
who's this kid?
He goes,

1202
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:05,070
he's good.
He's the only one that jumped in.

1203
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:07,320
He goes,
you want to come home for dinner?

1204
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:11,190
And that was the beginning of my life 
when I got in that police car.

1205
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:15,270
Wow.
Because I did whatever I did.

1206
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:17,280
Whatever the fuck I want to look at this
until today.

1207
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:22,580
This is fucking crazy.
And you know me and you don't fuck 

1208
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:22,650
around with.
He got over there.

1209
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:27,860
This is still,
that's what happened in 1970 fucking 

1210
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:30,090
three and once that today that's.
I'll go the car.

1211
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:32,460
What is this car to do it.
It does what?

1212
01:04:32,461 --> 01:04:34,770
It will need it to do.
It does whatever I needed to do.

1213
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:37,110
You know what I'm saying?
You're a family member.

1214
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:43,160
Why?
Because of that fucking day because I'm 

1215
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:43,160
the only guy that jumped in.

1216
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:48,770
I like how cops have things like that.
A family member have a card you can get 

1217
01:04:49,021 --> 01:04:51,410
from one of your buddies who's a cop 
show.

1218
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:53,730
Do you ever get pulled over and put this
on your license plates?

1219
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:57,930
A little sneaky little thing.
So now what type of meeting the house.

1220
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,320
I'm eating fucking pasta with fresh 
Mozzarella in the middle.

1221
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:03,210
Oh,
I could open up the front door,

1222
01:05:03,211 --> 01:05:04,740
whatever I wanted.
I called the mom,

1223
01:05:04,741 --> 01:05:06,330
mom.
She makes cream pops.

1224
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:07,980
Oh Wow.
I'm tight with them.

1225
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,970
I'm the only Cuban in 1974.
Let's even walking in there.

1226
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,740
So now we're in the sixth grade and 
we're playing kickball.

1227
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,430
Can Lee had no,
fucking remember two months ago I wanted

1228
01:05:20,431 --> 01:05:23,670
to generously donated 50,000
to a grammar school.

1229
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:27,400
Was my grandma's school North Bergen?
New Jersey a couple months ago?

1230
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:28,890
Yeah.
I wanted to.

1231
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:33,900
Genesis donated $50,000
when I went to that grammar school was 

1232
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:34,570
motherfuckers didn't have a gym.
Joe Rogan.

1233
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:36,790
You shovel snow.
They're going to be

1234
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,380
shoveled.
Snow shoveled snow.

1235
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,300
When it snowed out,
you shovel snow.

1236
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:47,540
That was part of your physical education
and you did pushups and sit ups and 

1237
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:51,420
fucking Russian Shit Bro.
And they had a bar in the kitchen.

1238
01:05:51,421 --> 01:05:56,421
We didn't know they were brutal.
Finally they built a gym in the eighth 

1239
01:05:56,421 --> 01:05:56,680
grade.
Yeah,

1240
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,290
but before that we played kickball 
outside in the fall.

1241
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:06,320
One day will king playing kickball,
and I forget this guy's name was Mr 

1242
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,770
Laura.
That was the teacher's name.

1243
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:10,260
Was he a good guy?
It was a little gym,

1244
01:06:10,261 --> 01:06:13,230
PJ and we're out there and we're playing
kickball and again,

1245
01:06:13,231 --> 01:06:16,170
that little Italian kid,
the one that invited me,

1246
01:06:16,171 --> 01:06:20,370
there was four other dude.
We're playing kickball and he's throwing

1247
01:06:20,371 --> 01:06:23,580
the ball and every time I swing and I 
miss,

1248
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:28,940
he's calling me Gacaca.
That means I'm a boogie face in Spanish 

1249
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:30,200
because it rhymes a coco.
Right.

1250
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:32,670
And the teacher keeps going.
But a,

1251
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,580
I told you a thousand times,
none of that SPEC sheets allowed.

1252
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:43,990
This is the sixth grade North Bergen,
New Jersey school teacher.

1253
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:47,420
Mr [inaudible] was like,
Hey,

1254
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,220
none of that shit over here.
Right?

1255
01:06:50,221 --> 01:06:51,420
This is America.
Right?

1256
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,580
Really?
That was at that time.

1257
01:06:53,581 --> 01:06:57,300
That was a big issue because a couple 
weeks before that,

1258
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:02,780
a guy named Portora was a baseball coach
and he threw a kid off for speaking 

1259
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:07,761
Spanish on the bus.
He told me there's no Spanish on the 

1260
01:07:07,761 --> 01:07:07,761
bus,
and the kid goes,

1261
01:07:07,761 --> 01:07:08,670
fuck you.
Or they spoke Spanish.

1262
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,130
They threw them off like 20 miles from 
the house.

1263
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,970
Became a big problem in my hometown.
They're going to kill the fucking dude,

1264
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:17,190
but I remember going home,
my mom going,

1265
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:19,410
he's talking to the truth

1266
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:24,060
and now she speaks Spanish.
This is America outside.

1267
01:07:24,061 --> 01:07:27,840
You speak American.
So my mom cut me off right there.

1268
01:07:27,841 --> 01:07:32,841
Like I went home,
like ready to fucking be like a 

1269
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:32,841
protestor.
She was like,

1270
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:33,450
that don't happen here.
We're Americans.

1271
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,460
He wants to expand.
It's totally like the house.

1272
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:40,200
I think there's a real benefit to being 
able to speak more than one language.

1273
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:43,680
Definitely is complete different 
mindset.

1274
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,400
I'm happy I do it.
I speak to my daughter in Spanish.

1275
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,460
If I tell him I asked him mercy,
something.

1276
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:55,210
I reasked her in Spanish.
If I read,

1277
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,940
I read tyler and spread.
Nice.

1278
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:02,780
Yeah.
They say that things like that they're 

1279
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:05,480
learning new languages in particular 
opens up parts of your brain that if 

1280
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,650
you're just a dummy like me that only 
speaks English.

1281
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:13,070
You can access different.
Just different ways of looking at 

1282
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:13,630
things,
you know?

1283
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,120
Well,
it's very analytical.

1284
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:15,970
Say you wanted

1285
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,710
to be a lawyer,
one of your pre.

1286
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:21,010
Whatever would be a language,
right?

1287
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:26,240
You'd also have a heavy math to be a 
lawyer,

1288
01:08:26,241 --> 01:08:29,630
you have to have a very heavy math 
prereq.

1289
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:30,620
Iom.
Yeah,

1290
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:35,621
a lot of history.
You probably ended up being a history 

1291
01:08:35,621 --> 01:08:38,021
major,
but there'd be a lot of math while the 

1292
01:08:38,021 --> 01:08:38,930
economy,
a lot on the analytics because it forces

1293
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:42,800
your mind to solve equations,
so when,

1294
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:46,670
if you look at the prerequisites,
if you whatever the fuck it is,

1295
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:47,890
what is the glue?
Requisites.

1296
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:51,980
Prerequisites to be an attorney.
It was a lot of math involved.

1297
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:54,260
Interesting.
There's got to be the language involved.

1298
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:57,850
There's got to be politics involved,
American political systems,

1299
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,560
American history systems,
all that shit,

1300
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:04,490
but it's got to be heavy math once you 
get the law.

1301
01:09:04,491 --> 01:09:07,970
School was heavy reading and.
But before that,

1302
01:09:07,971 --> 01:09:09,320
it's a lot of problem solving.

1303
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,970
Yeah,
that's the.

1304
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:15,260
That's how you become a problem solver 
by fucking whatever.

1305
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:17,090
Yeah,
I agree with you.

1306
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:20,720
Whatever you just said,
but before I got locked up,

1307
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:22,770
I was planning to be an attorney,
so I was really.

1308
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:24,380
I'm a history major.
Yeah,

1309
01:09:24,381 --> 01:09:26,780
that's that.
That was the fucking plan.

1310
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:30,230
And then history,
podcasts.

1311
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:32,360
I love them.
They're the best.

1312
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:34,720
I was thinking of going back to school.
No,

1313
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:35,020
no,
no,

1314
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:35,330
no,
no,

1315
01:09:35,331 --> 01:09:35,530
no,
no,

1316
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:35,810
no,
no,

1317
01:09:35,811 --> 01:09:36,110
no,
no.

1318
01:09:36,111 --> 01:09:41,111
There's no reason.
Just listening and refresh and then go 

1319
01:09:41,111 --> 01:09:43,811
on and read about it,
but that you listen to the great but a 

1320
01:09:43,811 --> 01:09:48,310
hardcore history and ever listing my boy
Daniel de la history on fire.

1321
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:52,790
His Shit.
It's fantastic.

1322
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:56,300
He was telling me about this road to 
Rome.

1323
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:01,390
I've never forgot this image where there
was I think something like a hundred and

1324
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:07,331
50 miles of bodies that were put on 
steaks.

1325
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:13,390
He sent it to me.
He just sounded to me a couple of days 

1326
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:15,431
ago,
hundred and 50 miles of of human bodies 

1327
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:21,370
that they stuck on these big poles and 
shoved him into the ground for like for 

1328
01:10:23,991 --> 01:10:25,610
my,
like every 30 yards,

1329
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:27,560
they put a new person's body.
Here it is.

1330
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:33,580
One hundred 25 miles with one body 
crucified every 30 yards or so for a 

1331
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:38,231
total of about 6,000
people crucified on the road between 

1332
01:10:38,271 --> 01:10:43,230
Capua and Rome.
What the fuck now?

1333
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:46,760
What was your purpose?
I would have to go back and listen to it

1334
01:10:46,761 --> 01:10:47,540
again.
I forgot.

1335
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,160
Sansa,
Shalom rather here.

1336
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:50,690
Whew.
That's shit's intense.

1337
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,450
I want to start with.
I'm going to start from zero.

1338
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,650
I'm going to start with the Mongolians 
and go listen.

1339
01:10:57,651 --> 01:11:02,651
Wrath of the con Dan Carlin greatest 
podcast world ever.

1340
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:06,080
And then I want to move on to American 
history.

1341
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:07,920
Oh,
he's the one I need to.

1342
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,220
American history one.
Oh,

1343
01:11:10,221 --> 01:11:13,130
one day one.
We're going back to the roots.

1344
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:17,430
Let's go from roots.
Let's go to 17,

1345
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:19,560
76.
What happened all there?

1346
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,200
I need all that.
Refresh.

1347
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:24,120
Yeah.
All that stuff needs to be refreshed.

1348
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:29,780
Do Carla and guy has got some stuff on 
world war one that's covered both wars 

1349
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,770
was covered.
Both wars.

1350
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:36,800
Let's cover the third war.
Vietnam and let's cover the fucking 

1351
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,610
whatever the conflict.
All that shit.

1352
01:11:38,611 --> 01:11:41,130
I was doing comedy so he watches the 
news.

1353
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,790
I don't know who the fuck was watching 
the news in 1991.

1354
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:49,791
Not Me.
I didn't watch TV again until 2003 or 

1355
01:11:49,801 --> 01:11:54,801
something like that and watch the 
fucking news and have a chance to be 

1356
01:11:54,801 --> 01:11:56,540
inclined politically or what the fuck 
was going on.

1357
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:58,610
I was just worried about doing standup.
Right.

1358
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:06,170
This silence brought to you by marijuana
or.

1359
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:06,600
I didn't.
No,

1360
01:12:06,601 --> 01:12:06,880
no,
no.

1361
01:12:06,881 --> 01:12:11,881
I didn't know.
I thought he was looking for something 

1362
01:12:11,881 --> 01:12:11,881
or whatever.
Or I'm ready to fucking go.

1363
01:12:11,881 --> 01:12:12,800
You know,
we've got a great fucking card.

1364
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,290
Just fucking breakdown.
Now.

1365
01:12:14,291 --> 01:12:17,080
You broke it down with Brendan.
I gotta tell you man,

1366
01:12:17,081 --> 01:12:19,870
I like.
I'm leaning and I love Dan male.

1367
01:12:19,871 --> 01:12:21,640
He's a fucking champions.
The champions.

1368
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:26,610
He took a fucking couple bombs from 
Anthony Johnson bomb,

1369
01:12:26,611 --> 01:12:29,260
Samantha Johnson,
but Jesus Christ,

1370
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:32,290
every time they put an obstacle in front
of steep based way,

1371
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:35,210
he figures out a way to take it down.
You know,

1372
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:40,610
he's hell bent on staying champion.
He's a giant dude like steep pays a big 

1373
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:45,340
guy and I know that Daniel has beaten 
every single heavyweight.

1374
01:12:45,341 --> 01:12:50,341
He's fought.
He's undefeated as a heavyweight and 

1375
01:12:50,341 --> 01:12:51,010
including like throwing Josh Barnett 
around who's just a beast,

1376
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:56,380
but a steep pays a as the most 
accomplished heavyweight champion of all

1377
01:12:56,381 --> 01:12:56,710
time.

1378
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:01,950
That's just a fact.
He defended his title against the top 

1379
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:04,690
contenders and did it successfully three
times.

1380
01:13:04,691 --> 01:13:06,940
Nobody else been able to do that.
Okay,

1381
01:13:06,941 --> 01:13:08,320
good.
Holloway.

1382
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:11,220
Jesus Christ.
When we fight both fights or Jesus,

1383
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:14,590
man,
a DC fight is a fascinating,

1384
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,750
fascinating fight to it.
So funny.

1385
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Nominal wrestler and steep a is.
I mean he's as good as it gets.

1386
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,640
You're doing the show Friday night?
Yeah,

1387
01:13:24,641 --> 01:13:26,860
we're doing.
Me and Ian are doing the Mirage.

1388
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:27,850
Okay,
beautiful.

1389
01:13:27,851 --> 01:13:28,600
Yeah.
Should be fun.

1390
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:31,570
Nice.
You ready for it?

1391
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:32,950
Yeah man.
I'm excited.

1392
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:35,590
I'm excited for this card.
It should be.

1393
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:40,620
It should be very interested in what's 
going on with you and the running 

1394
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:40,620
lately.
You're really digging it.

1395
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:40,620
Yeah,
I'm digging it,

1396
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,430
but I have a little bit of a tear in my 
meniscus.

1397
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:47,710
Are you thinking of if you fix them in 
this case of doing something with 

1398
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:48,640
running,
like running,

1399
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:50,600
but your buddy does those marathons?

1400
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:55,680
Oh No.
Have you considered something like that 

1401
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:55,680
or not really,
man,

1402
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:55,680
I'm not.
I don't.

1403
01:13:55,720 --> 01:14:00,720
I'm not into doing something that I know
is hard to do and it's definitely not 

1404
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:04,501
good for your body.
I just think you get beat up doing that 

1405
01:14:04,501 --> 01:14:05,320
shit.
Tomlin was just take your friend.

1406
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:07,960
I mean as good as Shannon.
Different kinds of human.

1407
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:12,980
Well,
he believes that in some ways they take 

1408
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:12,980
them to recover from something that.
Well,

1409
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:16,891
that's an interesting thing.
You just a good good time for that 

1410
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:16,891
question because he just ran a race 
today.

1411
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:21,360
He ran like a six mile race and he was 
saying that his legs are not fully 

1412
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,690
recovered.
Who was saying in the post that,

1413
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,250
you know,
his cardio was really good,

1414
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:28,030
but you got to figure you run for 24 
hours.

1415
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:32,320
I mean he ran for 24 hours just a month 
ago,

1416
01:14:32,321 --> 01:14:32,650
right?

1417
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,990
Was it a month ago?
Not even a month ago,

1418
01:14:34,991 --> 01:14:36,400
three weeks ago.
Something like that.

1419
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,640
Um,
that shit takes time and he's 50,

1420
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,620
you know,
when you're 50 years old,

1421
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:45,880
it's not as a recovery is that.
Recovery is very tough.

1422
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:49,150
He's an animal.
He lives to push himself like that.

1423
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:54,010
I'm more inclined to try to preserve my 
body.

1424
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:58,150
I like pushing myself,
but I'm just a chicken shit.

1425
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:03,210
I don't want to be,
I don't want to be breaking hips and 

1426
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:04,180
knees and shit.
Our brother just had shoulder surgery,

1427
01:15:04,181 --> 01:15:06,280
Eddie Bravo and he just got the stitches
out.

1428
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:09,820
This is his second surgery that he's had
just this year,

1429
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:11,740
you know,
he had um,

1430
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:15,850
he had knee surgery real recently,
like a few months ago,

1431
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:21,030
right?
Didn't he have his meniscus done a few 

1432
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:23,760
months ago?
This generation of Jujitsu guys is 

1433
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,340
learning a lot and they're learning what
they're going to pass on to the next 

1434
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,700
generation is that it's great to roll.

1435
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,190
The lego blocks are great at all.
That is great.

1436
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:35,850
But there's another aspect to this.
Disposition was called yoga and keeping 

1437
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:37,900
your muscles strong conditioning has to 
be good.

1438
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:39,210
And your,
uh,

1439
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,120
you know,
there's just take care of yourself.

1440
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,590
These,
these guys didn't.

1441
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:45,100
No,
you didn't.

1442
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:45,810
No,
no,

1443
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,580
no.
Well,

1444
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:51,640
it took a while to learn.
But the reality of Jujitsu is it's a 

1445
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:57,061
thing that as you get older you have to 
be much more careful who you trained 

1446
01:15:57,061 --> 01:15:58,990
with and how you train.
You can't just go balls to the wall like

1447
01:15:58,991 --> 01:16:03,991
you could when you were 27.
You have to keep your shit together and 

1448
01:16:03,991 --> 01:16:05,140
you know,
injuries are real.

1449
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:08,770
You can't just work through them.
Like that was a big fallacy.

1450
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:13,771
People would get hurt and they would try
to roll light and nobody ever rose 

1451
01:16:13,771 --> 01:16:13,810
light.
Then we say they're gonna roll light and

1452
01:16:13,811 --> 01:16:14,920
then the guy almost gets you in.

1453
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,350
Then you're trying to get him.
Next thing you know you're defending and

1454
01:16:17,351 --> 01:16:20,080
it's fucking serious.
Heated up roll session,

1455
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:21,970
which is great.
But then you're like,

1456
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:23,810
ah,
like you're next.

1457
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:24,780
All fucked up.
And you go,

1458
01:16:24,781 --> 01:16:25,470
all right,
next guy.

1459
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,830
I'm just going to lay on my back at 
work.

1460
01:16:26,831 --> 01:16:31,831
My half guard bullshit.
As soon as it starts getting hot and 

1461
01:16:31,831 --> 01:16:32,050
heavy,
almost got caught in an arm bar.

1462
01:16:32,051 --> 01:16:34,450
They didn't try to pop up,
but then try to pass his guard.

1463
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,240
Then you get into it.
You know,

1464
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,730
it's a,
it's a thing that's exciting,

1465
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,230
you know,
and she jitsu.

1466
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,490
Uh,
and when I say rolling hard,

1467
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:46,870
I don't mean like,
not even.

1468
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:48,760
No,
no,

1469
01:16:48,761 --> 01:16:51,290
no.
Listen to me passing your garden and lay

1470
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:53,260
it on you.
That's tough.

1471
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:58,450
That's a tough morning.
Even though I'm giving you love on top 

1472
01:16:58,450 --> 01:16:58,450
joke and you breathe.
Yeah.

1473
01:16:58,450 --> 01:16:58,450
Yeah.

1474
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:01,140
I'm good Joe.
I'm letting you get the book.

1475
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,720
I will give tons of love it.
I love it.

1476
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,000
Yeah,
addicted to it.

1477
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:07,930
It's changed who I am,
you know,

1478
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,580
I had an attack from a different 
foundation.

1479
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:13,910
I was attacking it from looking at Jamie
and going,

1480
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:19,240
I got to do what Jamie does and not 
realizing I got Jamie by 25 years and I 

1481
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:24,011
can't do what Jamie does.
So my game has to be completely 

1482
01:17:24,011 --> 01:17:26,000
different to Jamie's Mondays when I come
into class,

1483
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:27,680
it's more about the,
uh,

1484
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:29,270
the,
the uh,

1485
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:34,300
drilling less about the rolling and I'll
do an hour conditioning class with 

1486
01:17:34,671 --> 01:17:36,650
bread.
We do everything.

1487
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:39,320
We do the ball things,
the ropes.

1488
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:42,470
I do everything and I'll do that Jujitsu
class,

1489
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,560
but I'll do the drills are roll once or 
twice and papa's got to go Thursday.

1490
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:51,770
I go balls to the wall on the roaming,
which means three or four role.

1491
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:57,310
That's awesome.
And then I tried to take Friday off and 

1492
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:57,860
Saturday I'll do and conditioning and 
I'm done for the week.

1493
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:00,820
Joey Diaz getting fit.
You got to do it.

1494
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,750
I got this five year old,
number two,

1495
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:07,751
I watched your thing and I really do it.
I go to fucking crowd therapy and I put 

1496
01:18:07,751 --> 01:18:12,611
my head in that I got a US cryotherapy.
I'm a Novus or guy to that bed is making

1497
01:18:13,161 --> 01:18:14,870
me feel fucking phenomenal.
What is it?

1498
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,420
I'm getting tremendous Harlan's.
What is it?

1499
01:18:17,421 --> 01:18:19,700
The Nova thought bed.
The bed that you lay on,

1500
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,770
it cleans out yourselves and shit like 
that.

1501
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:24,050
Do it.
Does everything look it up?

1502
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:30,080
You understand me?
Plus I get in that freezer for three 

1503
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:30,870
minutes and 30 seconds.
I put Madonna.

1504
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:32,450
Burn enough you love.
And what?

1505
01:18:32,451 --> 01:18:36,200
The Gay Pride.
I forgot all about the gate center.

1506
01:18:36,201 --> 01:18:37,070
Fitter.
Healthier,

1507
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:38,570
happier.
What is it?

1508
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:43,570
Tremendous job doing it.
They're going to talk us into getting 

1509
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:45,860
into a pod and next thing you know 
you're going to be locked into the.

1510
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:47,670
Into the Matrix.
What?

1511
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:52,870
So what is this treatment?
No negative side effects clients or 

1512
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:56,540
supply supplied with safety goggles and 
then relax into Novo Thor treatment prod

1513
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:01,670
for eight to 15 minutes of whole body 
restorative light treatment.

1514
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:07,090
The treatment maybe repeated two or more
times a week.

1515
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,140
What is it?
Doing something what it's done,

1516
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,670
but like what does the instigate the 
fucking the other look into before,

1517
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:20,850
but tell me why I should get your light 
box.

1518
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:27,610
It's a whole body delivery system of PBM
therapy that has been designed to 

1519
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:31,220
deliver optimum wave lengths power.
What does that word?

1520
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:36,250
Densities and dosages based on the 
published clinical research outcomes.

1521
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,810
Huh?
I can't read.

1522
01:19:38,811 --> 01:19:40,940
For me it works the whole body,
just six slash 15 minutes.

1523
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:45,940
The intended use of Nova thor or to 
redevelop muscles or restore motion to 

1524
01:19:46,011 --> 01:19:51,011
joints or for use as an adjunct therapy 
for obesity.

1525
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:54,650
That seems like it does a lot of shit.
I don't know.

1526
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:56,600
Is that real?
I'm trying to hang on.

1527
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,410
Is that real?
Jamie?

1528
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:59,240
Do I look okay?
You look good.

1529
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:04,300
All right.
Then moving gun like you're losing 

1530
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:04,300
weight.
Yeah.

1531
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,030
No,
you have to do something.

1532
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:10,490
We all that training.
You do and you're doing that much 

1533
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:10,490
training.
That's crazy.

1534
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:10,710
That's really awesome.
I really love it.

1535
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,630
That's beautiful.
Yeah.

1536
01:20:11,631 --> 01:20:15,300
They tried to do one strength training 
at the House on that style with club.

1537
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:16,680
If you want to come here,
man.

1538
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,570
Well I'll work you out.
We'll work out together.

1539
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:22,550
I was thinking about calling you.
Maybe you can give me a kickbox and less

1540
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:24,030
than this and you know what else we 
could do?

1541
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:26,880
We could do like a circuit,
a circuit training because I have that,

1542
01:20:26,881 --> 01:20:30,180
a eco air bike,
that echo bike I've never done.

1543
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:34,870
That's phenomenal.
So we could do a rose the ACO bike and I

1544
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:36,750
got a versa climber and I like to do,
um,

1545
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,300
in a,
do those Tabata sequences.

1546
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:44,301
So it's like you go hard for 20 seconds 
and then you rest for 10 seconds and 

1547
01:20:44,301 --> 01:20:49,221
then you go hard for 20 seconds and the 
restaurant and you do like eight rounds 

1548
01:20:49,221 --> 01:20:49,650
of those.
It's fucking intense.

1549
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:51,560
And then you jump on over to the row 
machine.

1550
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:54,600
The machines,
there's another one similar number.

1551
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,130
It's like 30,
30,

1552
01:20:56,131 --> 01:20:57,540
hard,
30 off,

1553
01:20:57,630 --> 01:21:00,150
something like that.
And then you go to the versa climber and

1554
01:21:00,151 --> 01:21:01,820
you plug in some.
Yeah,

1555
01:21:01,821 --> 01:21:02,770
yeah.
I'm 52.

1556
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:05,290
I'm almost 51.
I'll be 51 in August to August.

1557
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:10,080
It's really interesting what I've 
learned and what I read about 50,

1558
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,920
I show a picture of Carol.
Okay.

1559
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:16,170
About a year ago when he was 46 years 
old,

1560
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:21,171
when he was doing,
while she finishes what Jesus only said,

1561
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:25,050
well,
go to that picture.

1562
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:28,330
Archie bunker was stopped or when he 
started out,

1563
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:32,370
it was a picture and it was 46 and I was
like,

1564
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:35,140
there has to be a better way.
Let me see that.

1565
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:38,070
I saw holy Shit,
you know,

1566
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:43,610
this is what America is crazy.
What did you look like at 46 and 47?

1567
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:46,020
And you were like,
look at that dude.

1568
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:51,440
He looked like,
well maybe that was like in the later 

1569
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:51,440
years.

1570
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,770
There's a funny thing,
right?

1571
01:21:53,771 --> 01:21:58,771
The lovable racist.
He was like the last of like he 

1572
01:21:59,801 --> 01:22:04,801
represented a real guide that might've 
had racist views that were kind of funny

1573
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:11,280
and he was just some way in deering 
because he was such a good actor and it 

1574
01:22:11,861 --> 01:22:16,861
was such a good character.
So well written and his relationship 

1575
01:22:16,861 --> 01:22:18,550
with his wife and his kids and with 
meathead.

1576
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:22,060
I mean the whole thing was,
it was a brilliant show.

1577
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:24,820
Well,
it's such a well crafted show.

1578
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:30,070
Sammy Davis kissed him on the lips when 
fucking Puerto Ricans do wallet.

1579
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:40,040
Rican guy comes over there talking.
He looks at his wife from Puerto Rico 

1580
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:43,440
was alice,
don't just stand there or something.

1581
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,580
And she goes,
I don't know what he likes.

1582
01:22:45,581 --> 01:22:46,770
And he goes,
I don't know,

1583
01:22:46,771 --> 01:22:49,240
a Puerto Rican his drink.
And he looks at him,

1584
01:22:49,241 --> 01:22:50,650
the guy smiling.
I'm like,

1585
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:53,370
he looks something like Puerto Rican 
drink.

1586
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,730
He goes,
I don't know.

1587
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,240
How about some pineapple juice?
You know what I'm saying?

1588
01:22:58,241 --> 01:23:01,360
The guy looks at it,
you get thrown off the Ed today,

1589
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:04,840
but it wasn't that.
It wasn't hateful.

1590
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:10,450
It was queens.
Racism.

1591
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,720
Well first of all,
pineapple juice is delicious.

1592
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:19,120
And why is it racist that a dude from an
island would want some pineapple juice?

1593
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:24,210
I would think that.
Would you be culturally sensitive to 

1594
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:28,591
like introduce that possibility,
that something that you do have a 

1595
01:23:28,591 --> 01:23:29,620
tradition of drinking?
Because if I said to you,

1596
01:23:29,621 --> 01:23:30,460
listen,
I'm leaving him,

1597
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:35,470
I'm going to try and make a fireworks.
Somebody heard me say it to you right 

1598
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:36,940
now.
Tomorrow we'd be good fucking.

1599
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:38,410
Yeah,
we would have a problem.

1600
01:23:38,411 --> 01:23:41,470
I would have a problem where everybody 
knows at 20 years ago,

1601
01:23:41,471 --> 01:23:46,471
right now,
I'd be heading to Chinatown in New York 

1602
01:23:46,471 --> 01:23:46,471
City.
Get the fuck on the matter of fireworks.

1603
01:23:46,471 --> 01:23:49,750
One hundred and 44 bottle rockets.
A couple of Roman candles.

1604
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:54,870
You know what's the most stupid man is 
that the food is somehow racist.

1605
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:58,690
Like there's.
There's food that's racist food.

1606
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:03,930
Like if you talked about black people 
and also talked about delicious fried 

1607
01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:07,921
chicken or delicious Orange Soda or 
grape soda would be grape soda right 

1608
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:09,310
now.
Orange Soda.

1609
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,510
So it white people.
Yeah.

1610
01:24:11,511 --> 01:24:13,060
Orange Soda is a white people thing,
right?

1611
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,530
White Trash,
Orange Soda?

1612
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,390
No.
Is that.

1613
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:22,860
Not that I'm anti Orange Soda,
but I'm saying like those foods like 

1614
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:24,640
watermelon and particular,
if you talk about a black person and you

1615
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:27,580
talk about watermelon,
that's a racist term.

1616
01:24:27,610 --> 01:24:30,910
Even though watermelon is delicious.
It's fucking weird.

1617
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:36,360
Like what the hell could be wrong about 
watermelon if you don't like the taste 

1618
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:40,801
of watermelon.
If it's a hot summer day and somebody 

1619
01:24:40,801 --> 01:24:42,100
busts open a cooler and gives you a 
slice of watermelon,

1620
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:43,720
how fucking pumped are you?

1621
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:47,350
How could watermelon ever be negative?
That don't make any sense.

1622
01:24:47,351 --> 01:24:52,351
To me,
it makes zero sense and the only way it 

1623
01:24:52,351 --> 01:24:55,081
makes sense that fried chicken can be 
negative to you is if you're a Vegan or 

1624
01:24:55,081 --> 01:24:56,500
a vegetarian and you don't want to eat a
chicken.

1625
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:01,680
That's the only way it makes sense that 
that would be a negative because 

1626
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:02,410
otherwise like fried chicken,
it's fucking delicious.

1627
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:04,840
Who doesn't like fried chicken?
If you eat meat,

1628
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:07,390
fried chicken is something you smell it.
You.

1629
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:12,750
Oh,
if someone's really good at making it 

1630
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:12,750
and they got a nice flaky lay on the 
outside,

1631
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:17,611
you bite into that juicy,
perfectly cooked chicken fried chicken 

1632
01:25:17,611 --> 01:25:21,590
in Tennessee,
Tennessee,

1633
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:24,910
a little fried chicken,
Jesus Christ.

1634
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,700
There's places that know how to do some 
fried chicken.

1635
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:29,410
God,
how could that be bad?

1636
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:31,580
How could that ever be racist?
I.

1637
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:32,950
That doesn't make any sense.

1638
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:38,950
We got to let that go.
I'm going to tell you a racist but not 

1639
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:38,950
really like sad.
That went to the park with my daughter.

1640
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:43,921
I'm sitting there.
This was sitting on Sunday with the 

1641
01:25:43,921 --> 01:25:47,731
beanie and his wife with glasses was 
Sherman oaks and had a $10 bills to 

1642
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:51,660
pocket that wanted to work my fucking 
pickpocketing skills.

1643
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:54,040
I want to say still pickpocket 
motherfucker.

1644
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:56,800
I even have my daughter bumper into his 
leg and stuff.

1645
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,680
You can't pick pocketed,
jude.

1646
01:25:58,690 --> 01:25:59,710
Doug,
you can't do it.

1647
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:01,750
You know,
when I was a kid,

1648
01:26:01,751 --> 01:26:04,040
that was my first fucking dream to

1649
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:09,110
pickpocket movie with our boy that and 
Michael Cyrusone who are the.

1650
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:14,550
The first pickpocket movie is called 
Harry in your pocket with a boy in your 

1651
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,220
flint.
Flint,

1652
01:26:16,221 --> 01:26:17,630
James Coburn.
Teams.

1653
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:21,660
Colburn was in a pickpocket.
Nobody knows about it.

1654
01:26:21,661 --> 01:26:26,661
Hit the American's greatest secret and 
they would work airports and shit like 

1655
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:29,930
that every pocket.
So I hunted down my mom.

1656
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:33,890
I used to hear them talk about this 
Cuban pickpocket guy and Cuba Cuban,

1657
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:35,930
the 15.
Oh yeah.

1658
01:26:35,931 --> 01:26:37,040
Tremendous.
Tremendous.

1659
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:38,960
You do with him.
You did something with him,

1660
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:39,430
right?
Oh yeah.

1661
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:44,440
I did two things with him.
I did American gun with him and I did a 

1662
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,070
list with him.
All this is up.

1663
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,120
You could find out that's online.
Somebody just posted in the wallet,

1664
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:54,180
I forgot about our list.
That's one of those shows that I forgot 

1665
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:57,011
about,
but I watched him and I asked this guy 

1666
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:57,011
out.

1667
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:58,100
He become a pickpocket.
I bumped into him at a Cuban joint.

1668
01:26:58,101 --> 01:27:01,240
There was a rumor going around that he 
was a good Cuba pickpocket and Cuban.

1669
01:27:01,241 --> 01:27:06,241
He goes,
you've got to get a dummy and put bells 

1670
01:27:06,241 --> 01:27:07,490
on the pockets.
That's where I went and I don't know how

1671
01:27:07,491 --> 01:27:12,491
I got it.
A little dummy and I put bells on and 

1672
01:27:12,491 --> 01:27:12,491
fucking years.
I tried to be a pick pocket,

1673
01:27:12,491 --> 01:27:14,260
but I have begun hands.
Yeah,

1674
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:16,610
you got to have those slender,
slender,

1675
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,830
slender,
her fingers.

1676
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:21,710
Little tells on fucking pockets and you 
bump into them and shit.

1677
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:26,970
I'm very light footed that I am.
I was a good burger because I can tip 

1678
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:27,200
toe.
You know what I'm saying?

1679
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:29,720
Like that's where my ears are.
Tip Toeing on the dummy.

1680
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:31,660
So trying to take the wallet from the 
dummy.

1681
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:36,670
I could just never fucking dummy.
It's great that you're doing so many 

1682
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:36,670
different things though.

1683
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:41,440
It's really cool to hear your role.
Then doing some more time and the 

1684
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,470
rolling has really improved because at 
first you can't roll.

1685
01:27:44,471 --> 01:27:49,471
I,
I dropped the weight because I figured 

1686
01:27:49,471 --> 01:27:49,760
for every five pounds I'd be a little 
bit more cardio.

1687
01:27:49,761 --> 01:27:51,790
Get.
Plus I got the mouthpiece.

1688
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,930
I spoke to them yesterday again.
He liked that thing.

1689
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:55,380
Huh?
I really believe in it.

1690
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,650
I use it while you're working out or do 
you usually what?

1691
01:27:58,651 --> 01:27:59,930
I walk.
You're walking.

1692
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,910
When I walk,
I take a walk in the morning,

1693
01:28:01,911 --> 01:28:04,340
20 slash 30 minutes explaining to people
what it is,

1694
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:07,490
the boss,
the boss route and mouthpieces on Amazon

1695
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:12,491
that says webpage.
I saw it because he was on joe talking 

1696
01:28:12,491 --> 01:28:16,451
about it.
I was having such a struggle with my 

1697
01:28:16,451 --> 01:28:16,451
breathing.
I was having such a struggle,

1698
01:28:16,451 --> 01:28:19,670
but it was just common sense.
Number one,

1699
01:28:19,671 --> 01:28:21,260
I smoked cigarettes for 20 years.

1700
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:24,110
Number two,
I smoked for 40 years,

1701
01:28:24,111 --> 01:28:27,860
but all those are just excuses.
The number one thing was the weight.

1702
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:32,110
Every fucking second is some smart guys 
at hand.

1703
01:28:32,111 --> 01:28:34,650
Some bastard.
He's such a handsome motherfucker.

1704
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:37,790
He's a great guy too.
He's one of the best people I know.

1705
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:39,540
Some guys say to me,
great guy,

1706
01:28:39,670 --> 01:28:43,130
a great brown belt,
told me that whenever he rose,

1707
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:45,860
he could feel the difference when he's 
10 pounds every.

1708
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:46,970
Oh yeah,
for sure.

1709
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,820
Whenever I go to my mother's and I come 
back that first week,

1710
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:52,610
it's brutal really.
And I go,

1711
01:28:52,611 --> 01:28:56,090
so if I'm walking around with three or 
nine trying to be fucking Eddie,

1712
01:28:56,210 --> 01:29:01,210
it's not gonna work.
So I just started shopping the way I 

1713
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:01,980
went back to weight.
I

1714
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,380
walked in there at three,
10,

1715
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:06,390
have a bunch of different rules now,
like what you can eat,

1716
01:29:06,391 --> 01:29:07,680
what you can eat.
I'm going to tell you something.

1717
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:12,740
You can eat as many eggs as you will see
you in the face and the face will look 

1718
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:12,870
in the face and tell you because you 
know,

1719
01:29:12,871 --> 01:29:17,871
you and I always had this conversation.
If you're heavy and you don't go to 

1720
01:29:18,001 --> 01:29:20,160
weight watchers because you're a fucking
loser.

1721
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,000
Whoa,
that's it.

1722
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:27,090
It's that easy.
It's that easy because I'm an idiot.

1723
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:29,220
I'm going to enjoy it.
I'm a fucking idiot.

1724
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:31,790
And pop hip hop.
Come on.

1725
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,210
That's my guy.
That's my guy.

1726
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:36,930
So,
so you,

1727
01:29:36,931 --> 01:29:38,940
uh,
put everything you eat into this app,

1728
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:40,450
to the APP.
Oh Nice.

1729
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,180
Okay.
Let me show you what I was.

1730
01:29:42,181 --> 01:29:45,210
I got dinner,
snacks total.

1731
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:47,070
And then you,
uh,

1732
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:52,071
you counted on by points.
Is that what they do is they do it 

1733
01:29:52,071 --> 01:29:52,071
themselves.

1734
01:29:52,071 --> 01:29:52,071
You know how many points you get in a 
day?

1735
01:29:52,071 --> 01:29:54,120
Thirty nine.
Now let's say Joey,

1736
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:57,840
would you eat that?
Give me a can of coffee right there.

1737
01:29:58,150 --> 01:30:00,230
Give me that one problem.
You don't think?

1738
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,070
Okay,
we don't know.

1739
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:06,090
So you scan that and then it'll tell you
how many.

1740
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,700
I don't think that has many calories.
Does coffee,

1741
01:30:08,701 --> 01:30:10,830
plain coffee of calories?
Not really.

1742
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:14,230
Maybe a couple,
but not really.

1743
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:19,340
When you get the fucking milkshake 
coffees for breakfast and he and the 

1744
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:21,060
fucking flat white,
the flat white don't cut you.

1745
01:30:21,061 --> 01:30:22,220
All right.
This isn't in that.

1746
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:24,120
You go like this,
boom.

1747
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:26,160
And then you got this Joe Rogan.
You're ready.

1748
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:31,400
You press this over here and you press 
this here and you press this here and 

1749
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:32,970
they give you points for whatever you 
do.

1750
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:36,240
Walk Circuit Training.
Then you have custom.

1751
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:40,620
So I press Brazilian Jujitsu.
Lets you go to an hour class.

1752
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:42,330
How much do you really fuck them?
Roll.

1753
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:47,780
Fifteen minutes.
People don't know what class you're 

1754
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:47,780
doing.
Technique.

1755
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:49,890
He teaches you how to do the drill and 
he tells you a joke.

1756
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:53,970
So you press and 15 done and then you 
press the intensity.

1757
01:30:54,230 --> 01:30:55,520
Will you breathed on?
Adam?

1758
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:59,130
I just bet seven points.
You leave this in your phone,

1759
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:04,150
in your pocket.
You put this in your pocket and fucking 

1760
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:05,040
guess what happens?
It counts the steps.

1761
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:08,430
When I went to Disneyland,
that burge dirty one fucking points.

1762
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:14,300
So it's all the executive for breakfast.
So for breakfast I go to John's and I 

1763
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:18,081
got to see that role.
Even if I give myself full fucking 

1764
01:31:18,081 --> 01:31:18,420
points for the row,
five points,

1765
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:21,990
six points for the role.
I put two eggs on that motherfucking,

1766
01:31:21,991 --> 01:31:26,120
which is 14 grams of protein.
I put a thin slice of humans.

1767
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:30,000
Boys had an American cheese and some 
frank's hot sauce on that motherfucker.

1768
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:30,850
I ain't gonna.
Talk to me.

1769
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:37,050
Talk to me.
So you essentially can eat anything you 

1770
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:37,050
want as long as you know what the points
are.

1771
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:39,030
I get a certain amount of points.
Fish,

1772
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:44,540
I cut out fish you for days,
so I'll leave here and go to fucking 

1773
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:45,720
Sushi Dan,
and I'll get the crunchy albacore,

1774
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:48,420
which is.
I can't wait for Rogan to visit me.

1775
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,540
It sliced albacore covered with 
Jalapenos,

1776
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:54,960
onion and garlic cloves.
It's possible.

1777
01:31:54,961 --> 01:31:59,961
Let me ask you this.
Is it possible that you could eat just 

1778
01:31:59,961 --> 01:32:01,490
all eggs all day and it has zero point,
zero point?

1779
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:05,040
Really eggs all day,
all day.

1780
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,270
That sounds crazy.
Fish all day.

1781
01:32:07,271 --> 01:32:12,271
Sea Bass,
all you could eat salmon and sea bass 

1782
01:32:12,271 --> 01:32:12,271
all day.
Chicken breast,

1783
01:32:12,271 --> 01:32:14,470
no skin,
no skin all motherfucking day.

1784
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:16,900
All Day.
Chicken breasts,

1785
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:20,660
not chicken cutlets.
Mom made with Italian breadcrumbs.

1786
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:21,100
No,
no,

1787
01:32:21,101 --> 01:32:21,410
no,
no.

1788
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:26,870
That's fried grilled chicken breast with
red crushed peppers and a baked potato.

1789
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:30,070
Five points for the baked potato.
Oh,

1790
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:33,810
so you want to tell me again how 
listening.

1791
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:35,890
It's not a journey.
It's not a fucking race.

1792
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,260
She before.
It's only healthy.

1793
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:40,570
Lose like a pound,
pound and a half a week.

1794
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:42,390
Is that what it is?
That's what it really.

1795
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:47,410
They say anything after that,
you go into that loser show where they 

1796
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:51,061
lost all that weight at one shot and 
then that's why all these diets and 

1797
01:32:51,161 --> 01:32:54,040
stuff that you have to do on something 
that you're going to do forever.

1798
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:57,340
I've always liked this.
I lost 100 pounds with this.

1799
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:02,400
Yeah,
and then I gained 40 and now I lost 

1800
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,520
another 30.
That's awesome.

1801
01:33:03,521 --> 01:33:06,130
And it hasn't been killing me like I 
don't miss nothing.

1802
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:08,170
You know,
when I learned I didn't know this,

1803
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:12,030
I will go get an outside.
He bought American thinks announcer.

1804
01:33:12,150 --> 01:33:14,020
Ebola was great.
Let me explain something to you.

1805
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:19,480
Eating a banana and putting them banana.
The blend is two different things.

1806
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:23,410
I did not know that when that was making
one of those,

1807
01:33:23,411 --> 01:33:25,590
because I switched.
I have on it proteins,

1808
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:27,670
which I use the vanilla or the 
chocolate,

1809
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:32,720
the Mexican chocolate,
and then I had this other one that's a 

1810
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:36,041
polio type protein.
It's coconut milk and I put a use that 

1811
01:33:36,521 --> 01:33:41,521
one in one day.
So let me put a bland in this 

1812
01:33:41,521 --> 01:33:41,521
motherfucker just to see it.
I'm like,

1813
01:33:41,521 --> 01:33:41,521
damn,
this is delicious.

1814
01:33:41,521 --> 01:33:43,420
I'm onto something.
I gained weight that week.

1815
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,640
I didn't know what it was.
I'm the banana.

1816
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:49,660
When you blend the banana,
it's eight points,

1817
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:52,900
but when you eat a banana,
it's gods,

1818
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:57,730
but it's for you because when you eat 
fruit and when you drink fruit,

1819
01:33:57,731 --> 01:34:00,700
it's two different things.
That's why walgreens fat people,

1820
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:02,290
when you see him going,
I don't eat breakfast.

1821
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:05,200
I drink a smoothie.
You're killing yourself.

1822
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:10,510
You were killing yourself every time you
puree fruit because when you eat fruit,

1823
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:13,320
the sativa,
it's alive.

1824
01:34:13,321 --> 01:34:18,321
It's saliva's.
God forbid the saliva in your mouth 

1825
01:34:18,321 --> 01:34:21,160
breaks the fruit down and digestive the 
sugar a different way.

1826
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:24,970
When you bypass that enzyme in your 
mouth,

1827
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:27,850
that's when you get 300 pounds like 
uncle joey.

1828
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:30,880
So when you drink fruit,
I don't care if they tell you,

1829
01:34:30,881 --> 01:34:32,050
oh,
it's frozen fruit.

1830
01:34:32,051 --> 01:34:34,600
You lose some of the sugar.
That's bullshit.

1831
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:39,220
Once you fucking blend that fruit,
you dead because it goes right into your

1832
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:40,710
sister.
Go out as the assistant,

1833
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,220
all the fiber and was like,
why?

1834
01:34:42,730 --> 01:34:43,280
Why?
Why?

1835
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:48,880
You're not supposed to learn that shit 
any other way other than the way that 

1836
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:52,771
comes when you eat it.
You can go to that fucking little 

1837
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:53,650
Mexican stand with the umbrellas.
You ever see those guys?

1838
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:55,540
The cartel could delivery.
Is that what that is?

1839
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,650
Yeah.
That's when the cartel drops that money.

1840
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,420
Shake him down and I got three that guys
over there cutting fruit with a machete.

1841
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:03,860
Go ahead.
I dare you to go up.

1842
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:07,610
When you see a cod,
tell umbrella that that's a cartel money

1843
01:35:07,611 --> 01:35:12,611
that,
that they got tons of money in those 

1844
01:35:12,611 --> 01:35:12,611
days.
They just confuse people.

1845
01:35:12,611 --> 01:35:13,170
They even got them across the street 
from one another.

1846
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:17,450
Well that starbucks.
Don't you think they're just poor people

1847
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:19,010
and trying to make some money?
Not really.

1848
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:24,090
You're not going to get me apples.
You've got to sell the fucking pay rent 

1849
01:35:24,090 --> 01:35:24,520
in this 10 days and times.
Nobody stands out there.

1850
01:35:24,521 --> 01:35:26,570
Look at those.
Mexicans don't even use SPF.

1851
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:29,470
They're out there raw with no fucking 
umbrella out there.

1852
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:32,240
They look darker than dark.
They get dark.

1853
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:33,100
Were you thinking you?
You know,

1854
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:35,150
but you got to pay me to standing out 
there on fucking thing.

1855
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,940
This weather a lot.
They got like $200 a day,

1856
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:42,941
$300 a day.
Not because they're cutting the apples 

1857
01:35:42,941 --> 01:35:45,581
up because the guy comes with a Poncho 
and takes what's underneath them and 

1858
01:35:45,581 --> 01:35:46,640
takes it straight to Mexico on 
Thursdays.

1859
01:35:46,641 --> 01:35:51,641
Nobody sees nothing that every time you 
eat that fruit and sprinkled with 

1860
01:35:51,641 --> 01:35:52,250
cocaine.
He told me that fruit.

1861
01:35:52,251 --> 01:35:57,251
Well now watch the energy.
You get like that box of roaring for be 

1862
01:35:57,251 --> 01:36:00,220
poor farmers because that's how nice 
people are using.

1863
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:01,280
For me,
I'm a criminal.

1864
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:04,700
I see people for what it is.
I see things for what is.

1865
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:10,270
I'm trying to sell the leader or rehab 
because I got a friend that's got to 

1866
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:10,270
rehab.
You go down there,

1867
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:14,240
so send lead to him because he could 
make money.

1868
01:36:14,241 --> 01:36:16,700
There's a rehab,
there's a bunch of rehabs or Florida you

1869
01:36:16,701 --> 01:36:20,450
go to and they get your insurance and 
they bang your insurance for 60 and then

1870
01:36:20,451 --> 01:36:21,890
they give you a cut back at 30.

1871
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:24,740
I totally let me send you down into my 
buddy's.

1872
01:36:24,741 --> 01:36:26,740
Give me 10 percent.
I get three grid,

1873
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:32,830
get acupuncture to give you a few 
massages or do you give a fuck the rehab

1874
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:41,900
business?
Imagine who would be in terms of his 

1875
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:46,031
marijuana consumption.
Imagine where he would be if it wasn't 

1876
01:36:46,031 --> 01:36:46,190
for you,
like terrorists.

1877
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:51,490
That guy when you first started having 
him on your show when you guys first 

1878
01:36:51,651 --> 01:36:55,280
started doing smoke pot,
maybe three times in college,

1879
01:36:56,240 --> 01:37:00,380
a couple months in.
He's done superhero doses of edibles.

1880
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:03,320
Couple months.
I mean like little by little,

1881
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:08,350
little by little bit.
When you would sneak him in on him and 

1882
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:08,350
you would take away at 2:50
and pointed a $500.

1883
01:37:08,351 --> 01:37:09,430
What I would do,
wrap it,

1884
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:14,500
I get this is Joey Diaz,
Costar and the Church of what's 

1885
01:37:17,661 --> 01:37:20,060
happening now is completely asleep at 
the wheel.

1886
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:24,110
He's on the show and his eyes are almost
totally closed,

1887
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:27,560
is barely a slip.
They just dazed.

1888
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:29,390
Who's the guest?
Who is that?

1889
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:33,560
It's right in Bosnia.
A kid that I told on this podcast,

1890
01:37:34,990 --> 01:37:39,080
he can't take him though high.
What is the name of this video?

1891
01:37:39,081 --> 01:37:43,130
Jamie Lee space.
Outer Space.

1892
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:47,860
Look at him.
Go.

1893
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:50,480
He's guy.
I would get these.

1894
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:53,480
Okay.
I would go in the afternoons and I would

1895
01:37:53,481 --> 01:37:58,481
get a one 80 and I would rip the cover 
off the one 80 and I would take a 67 

1896
01:37:58,891 --> 01:38:00,960
slash 60 milligram woman.
I'd eat that one.

1897
01:38:00,961 --> 01:38:03,240
It was like two in the afternoon.
They don't do nothing to me.

1898
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:07,530
I'll eat like a 60 and I'd take the one 
80 and pulling the 60 rapper.

1899
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:10,320
Oh No.
And then I bring it to him,

1900
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:15,350
put it on the table and in front of them
I go here and then open it up for him 

1901
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:17,000
and he wouldn't see it.
It was half open the reading,

1902
01:38:18,290 --> 01:38:19,290
give them the 60,

1903
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:25,100
but it was like last night I gave him an
expired where they had a little bit of 

1904
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:27,951
mold on it.
He's going to be a good comment a bro.

1905
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:38,400
Look at eleanor.
Eleanor sat there for 15 years,

1906
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:44,090
shut her mouth and watched.
There's a really special gift to that.

1907
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:48,470
What do you think was funny in it?
Whether you agree with her.

1908
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:53,770
I give her the balls.
A lot of people don't like just sitting 

1909
01:38:53,770 --> 01:38:56,040
there and watching.
There's a lot of people that do though,

1910
01:38:56,041 --> 01:38:57,840
you know,
there's a lot of people that work in and

1911
01:38:57,841 --> 01:39:00,180
around comedy clubs that probably want 
to do it.

1912
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,640
They just don't know how to get started,
you know,

1913
01:39:02,641 --> 01:39:05,610
they just don't have it in them to get 
the ball rolling.

1914
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:07,110
It's hard.
It's hard to.

1915
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:09,810
Hard to try something new.
He keeps thinking about when's the right

1916
01:39:09,811 --> 01:39:10,410
time to do it.

1917
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:11,450
Is it now?
Maybe.

1918
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:12,580
Should I wait a week,
you know,

1919
01:39:12,581 --> 01:39:17,581
you know what?
I want to lose 10 pounds and then I'm 

1920
01:39:17,581 --> 01:39:19,401
going to try it.
And you get all these things in your 

1921
01:39:19,401 --> 01:39:19,401
head.
How long did it take you?

1922
01:39:19,401 --> 01:39:19,401
Seriously?
Honest,

1923
01:39:19,401 --> 01:39:19,530
honest,
honest engine.

1924
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:24,150
Well,
my birthday was August 11th and uh,

1925
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:29,180
when I turned 21 was August 11th of 2019
88 rather.

1926
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:36,080
So I got on stage August 27th.
So from my birthday too,

1927
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:39,180
when I got on stage,
it was just a few days.

1928
01:39:39,330 --> 01:39:42,540
It was just terrified.
Terrified.

1929
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:47,780
I was trying to check it out.
I'm Jonathan Katz was the emcee and um,

1930
01:39:48,270 --> 01:39:53,270
I was maybe going to get up.
It was one of those things were signed 

1931
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:53,270
up for the list,
you know,

1932
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:58,011
you get,
I think it was five minutes and there's 

1933
01:39:58,011 --> 01:39:59,931
a bunch of people that are going to do 
five minutes and Jonathan Katz who was 

1934
01:39:59,931 --> 01:40:01,080
already an established standup comedian,
really funny guy,

1935
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:04,000
and he was the host and he's like,
um,

1936
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:06,000
he came up to me,
he said,

1937
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:08,690
let me check in a half an hour in to see
if I can get your.

1938
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:12,870
Cause sometimes people wouldn't show up.
And so a half an hour in,

1939
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:18,590
I'm,
I'm thinking I'm just going to check it 

1940
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:18,590
out.
I'm just going to bail.

1941
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:20,880
I'm just gonna tell him forget about it.
And when I'm thinking this in my head,

1942
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:22,830
I walked up to him and he's,
I got you in jail.

1943
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:23,670
So,
uh,

1944
01:40:23,671 --> 01:40:26,940
you'll be going up right here and you'll
have five minutes.

1945
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:28,170
Good luck.
And I said,

1946
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:28,500
well,
all right,

1947
01:40:28,501 --> 01:40:29,430
thank.
Thanks man.

1948
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:31,980
Okay,
so I was ready to push out,

1949
01:40:31,981 --> 01:40:36,981
dude.
I was totally ready to push you out and 

1950
01:40:36,981 --> 01:40:37,710
I was so nervous.
The first time I went on stage,

1951
01:40:37,711 --> 01:40:42,711
I was fucking terrified.
I couldn't believe it was the name of 

1952
01:40:42,711 --> 01:40:42,711
the place.
Stitches,

1953
01:40:42,711 --> 01:40:42,711
stitches,
comedy club.

1954
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,370
August 27,
19,

1955
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:46,740
88.
I was terrified.

1956
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:49,530
Terrified.
I couldn't believe I was scared.

1957
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,030
I didn't.
It didn't make any sense to me.

1958
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:54,040
I didn't think I was going to be scared.
I thought maybe it'd be like a little

1959
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,590
nervous,
like I'd never performed before.

1960
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:58,990
So this idea of doing and it was like,
well,

1961
01:40:58,991 --> 01:40:59,580
you know,
I've,

1962
01:40:59,581 --> 01:41:04,581
I've taught taekwondo classes in front 
of people before I can talk in front of 

1963
01:41:04,581 --> 01:41:08,221
people.
And then I thought about the idea to 

1964
01:41:08,221 --> 01:41:10,090
stand up in front of people,
so don't fuck it took me.

1965
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:15,120
It's crazy.
It took me a year to think about it 

1966
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:19,951
because then it snowed.
I couldn't go to work because we can't 

1967
01:41:19,951 --> 01:41:21,590
roof in Colorado.
Right.

1968
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:26,920
Should I read to the punchline with Tom 
Hanks and sally fields?

1969
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:30,370
Angel Salazar.
Damon Wayans,

1970
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:36,330
a bunch of people in that movie.
I watched punchline and that pissed me 

1971
01:41:37,451 --> 01:41:40,690
the fuck off.
That was it.

1972
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:43,600
I went into the yellow pages.
I found comedy clubs.

1973
01:41:43,601 --> 01:41:48,030
I called them and comedy works offered a
Tuesday night open mic.

1974
01:41:48,031 --> 01:41:50,830
How do I get on?
You have to call in and they'll give you

1975
01:41:50,831 --> 01:41:51,490
three minutes.

1976
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:55,150
Okay,
so for two months I called him nothing.

1977
01:41:55,180 --> 01:42:00,180
And then one night there like Joe Diaz 
and I called him back that night I got 

1978
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:06,390
sick.
I got the float was like I'm not going 

1979
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:06,390
out of their.
Wow.

1980
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:08,410
And then I was roofing,
roofing,

1981
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:09,460
roofing,
roofing,

1982
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:12,340
Mr Madan jobs.
I'm going to different jobs and dropping

1983
01:42:12,341 --> 01:42:16,030
off material.
I'd like to cruise working and I went to

1984
01:42:16,031 --> 01:42:17,380
one crew when they go,
hey man,

1985
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,910
we're stuck here,
this job.

1986
01:42:18,911 --> 01:42:21,940
Can you get us the morning break?
And I go,

1987
01:42:21,941 --> 01:42:22,780
yeah,
I'll go over there.

1988
01:42:22,781 --> 01:42:25,930
And I went over to this little diner 
right off the fucking dirty,

1989
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:30,820
whatever that I 77,
25.

1990
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:35,910
Which one?
But when the Denver it was like our 

1991
01:42:35,910 --> 01:42:37,780
industrial area trucks everywhere.
I don't remember what the number of that

1992
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:39,320
road is.
A road there,

1993
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:44,680
but there was a place around the corner.
Jamie had the best fucking Green Chili.

1994
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:49,030
You add your fucking life and when you 
pulled him over fucking scrambled eggs,

1995
01:42:49,031 --> 01:42:53,680
you dick would get fucking fuck.
Two to a t is,

1996
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:58,720
are you kidding me?
That goes fucking to walk over there.

1997
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:03,780
I sit down and you know,
there's always a paper in front of you 

1998
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:05,020
ever go to a diner or something.
There's always a paper.

1999
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:08,100
Somebody read and I sit down,
I give the waitress.

2000
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:11,320
I'm sitting in,
I look over and I went like this just on

2001
01:43:11,321 --> 01:43:12,190
a,
you know,

2002
01:43:12,191 --> 01:43:15,430
you just go like that to the middle.
And when I opened it it said,

2003
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,360
do you want to be a standup comic?
Whoa.

2004
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:25,740
And it was an article on Roseanne became
a standup comic and now because of 

2005
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:29,850
Denver,
she had just blown up like Rosanna had 

2006
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:33,240
just blown up.
It was maybe march of 91.

2007
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:39,490
Rosanna had just blown up.
Denver was a hotbed Jack.

2008
01:43:39,490 --> 01:43:43,990
Everybody was drinking the water or be 
wanting to see what Rosanne was doing.

2009
01:43:43,991 --> 01:43:48,991
So it had a big thing about Roseanne and
it had all these open mic spot and it 

2010
01:43:48,991 --> 01:43:53,791
had the classes that you could take and 
there was a class in boulder for $33,

2011
01:43:55,370 --> 01:43:59,210
three Sundays in a row at the University
of Colorado.

2012
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:02,470
Part of the continuing education,
the guy that taught it,

2013
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:07,480
his name is jeff harms and I went the 
first Sunday that okay with the second 

2014
01:44:08,271 --> 01:44:13,271
Sunday did okay.
In the third Sunday I performed on the 

2015
01:44:13,271 --> 01:44:13,820
way out.
He took me aside and he goes,

2016
01:44:13,821 --> 01:44:15,590
I don't know how serious you are about 
this,

2017
01:44:15,591 --> 01:44:18,470
but you're onto something.
If you want to do it,

2018
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:20,090
let me know.
And I left there going,

2019
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:25,470
I want to sell coke.
Fucking crack jokes,

2020
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:32,220
cracked fucking jokes,
pickpocket or fucking fucking come up 

2021
01:44:34,191 --> 01:44:36,830
with birds and shit.
I swear to God.

2022
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:38,300
I'm like,
are you fucking crazy?

2023
01:44:39,110 --> 01:44:44,110
I don't know if I can be a comedian.
And then about a month later I saw an ad

2024
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:47,240
in the paper for Dorman for comedy 
clubs.

2025
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:51,680
I called it up and they said,
come up on the way there.

2026
01:44:51,681 --> 01:44:54,530
I called Jeff.
He gave me his number because he said,

2027
01:44:54,690 --> 01:44:55,970
when we got on stage,
just me,

2028
01:44:56,060 --> 01:45:01,060
I'll put you up somewhere and I go,
there's a job for a doorman at wit's 

2029
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:02,600
end.
Do you think I could get it?

2030
01:45:02,601 --> 01:45:04,120
And he goes to the alcohol.
The Guy Right now,

2031
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:05,540
you got it.
Just dragged them,

2032
01:45:05,541 --> 01:45:07,850
fill out the APP,
you tell them you're friends with me and

2033
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:13,170
it made me a doorman slash sound guy in 
the bar back quit.

2034
01:45:15,630 --> 01:45:20,630
So I was the door guy,
sound guy in the bar back and after 

2035
01:45:21,471 --> 01:45:24,650
about six months I had two jobs.
I hated going home.

2036
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:29,120
I had a marriage that was just fucking 
just like the one that we all talk about

2037
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:31,880
when you cannot go home,
it's not your home anymore.

2038
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:36,230
I would basically leave at six,
come home at five,

2039
01:45:36,231 --> 01:45:40,460
take a shower,
eat whatever fucking crap she cooked,

2040
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:44,780
give the baby a kiss and I get in my 
truck and go back to Westminster.

2041
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,980
It was a club away from the comedy 
works.

2042
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:50,450
It was in Westminster,
but it wasn't.

2043
01:45:50,451 --> 01:45:52,340
It didn't get the best people in the 
world.

2044
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:54,680
You know what I'm saying?
You have to lose people in there.

2045
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:57,620
People will poach bands and shit like 
that.

2046
01:45:58,490 --> 01:46:01,670
So I still have.
And then in the middle of all that,

2047
01:46:01,671 --> 01:46:06,671
it took me two months to get a spot from
Wendy and then I went down at Nicholson 

2048
01:46:07,990 --> 01:46:09,270
army,
one of the original owners.

2049
01:46:09,610 --> 01:46:13,850
Mr Wendy with comedy comedy,
comedy works in Denver.

2050
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:16,390
He was one of the original owners,
but when he had Nicholson,

2051
01:46:16,450 --> 01:46:21,450
he told me to keep coming back,
but I knew when I walked off that stage,

2052
01:46:22,670 --> 01:46:26,870
that life as I knew it has ad ended.
How so?

2053
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:31,350
Whatever I thought life was at that 
point.

2054
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:36,490
I had gone out the window like I.
Saturday was fucked up for me because 

2055
01:46:36,921 --> 01:46:39,680
Saturday I was supposed to be somewhere 
this week,

2056
01:46:39,681 --> 01:46:43,130
but I couldn't go.
I had to go to my friend's mother's 80th

2057
01:46:43,131 --> 01:46:46,310
birthday party and why it was important.
It was in Philly.

2058
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:49,070
It was away from philly.
She's in an old folks home.

2059
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:53,310
They're the second family that took me 
in when my mom died,

2060
01:46:54,190 --> 01:46:56,620
but they took me in a crucial spot.
Gel,

2061
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:01,560
you're throwing me out.
I'm 17 and I know where to go.

2062
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:07,220
I couldn't go to my stepfather,
so I had an aunt in New York and I can 

2063
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:11,961
live with and I had a godmother in 
Harlem and I didn't want to live with 

2064
01:47:11,961 --> 01:47:11,961
both on the job.

2065
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:17,120
Like I wasn't mad.
I just mentioned to a friend one day we 

2066
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,840
were out snorting coke drinking and I 
told him,

2067
01:47:18,841 --> 01:47:23,841
I know what I'm saying,
they gonna throw me out of the data and 

2068
01:47:23,841 --> 01:47:26,040
he wasn't even good friends with me and 
about a week later I saw him at school.

2069
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:27,690
I think it was a man.
I talked to my father.

2070
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:30,540
You could move in with us.
That was whose birthday?

2071
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:35,541
It was on Saturday,
so when I got off the phone with her I 

2072
01:47:35,541 --> 01:47:36,810
was thinking about how important they 
were to me,

2073
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:41,930
but I still remember being 17 and 
sitting on that hill on 86th and county 

2074
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:46,401
blvd.
Thinking about how I had nowhere to go 

2075
01:47:46,401 --> 01:47:48,540
bro.
Like This was my only shot.

2076
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:53,720
Like I had nowhere to go nowhere.
There wasn't like a homeless shelter.

2077
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:58,590
I didn't know where the fuck to go.
I probably had $10 in my pocket and then

2078
01:47:58,591 --> 01:48:00,010
the younger brother ran up,
down.

2079
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:05,030
When he goes dog,
they're waIting for you to come to eat 

2080
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:05,030
the dinner.
I'm over there.

2081
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:08,100
I had never met the parents.
How lucky am I?

2082
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:13,820
I never met the parents.
That's pretty lucky and I walked in and 

2083
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:16,980
they had like six kids and there wasn't 
like what I was used to living.

2084
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:22,040
They had nowhere to conditioning.
The parents were blue collar and they 

2085
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:22,860
took me in.
I made me a part of that home,

2086
01:48:23,850 --> 01:48:28,850
never asked me for rent,
wasn't the fucking best house on the 

2087
01:48:28,850 --> 01:48:32,751
bLock,
but to this day I'm tight with all the 

2088
01:48:32,751 --> 01:48:33,090
four brothers and sisters.
It's like,

2089
01:48:33,091 --> 01:48:34,440
well,
we're all one big family,

2090
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:39,980
but then kind of fucking lucky like I'm 
not even talking about being thankful 

2091
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:43,080
for the comedy bridge.
Just a personal bridge over like I was a

2092
01:48:43,081 --> 01:48:48,081
killer and in and at that point I had 
lost all faith in humanity.

2093
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,620
Like I was done.
like I wasn't a catholic no more.

2094
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:56,040
I was just waiting to kill somebody.
That's it.

2095
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:57,210
That's all I was waiting,
man.

2096
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:02,780
It's such a weird,
like I'm not even worried about the 

2097
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:06,051
comedy bridge.
No more was the personaL bridge where I 

2098
01:49:06,051 --> 01:49:06,051
grew the most,
you know,

2099
01:49:06,051 --> 01:49:06,510
I don't even know how we got In this 
conversation.

2100
01:49:06,511 --> 01:49:08,420
This week is killing me.
It's good weed.

2101
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,070
They're going to kill the good weed now.
Right.

2102
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:12,810
Is that what's happening?
How does this work?

2103
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:13,660
How does it.
No,

2104
01:49:13,661 --> 01:49:14,150
no,
no.

2105
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:16,040
I still got some guys.
Yeah,

2106
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:18,930
I'm sure you do legally,
but illegally for.

2107
01:49:18,931 --> 01:49:21,170
It'll still be available for medicinal 
people that have.

2108
01:49:21,230 --> 01:49:23,190
we've got to get a card.
Recreational.

2109
01:49:23,191 --> 01:49:24,990
It's going to be to renew that card.
Son.

2110
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:27,990
I go,
I got to redo that car.

2111
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:33,470
I don't want any of your bullshit weed.
I don'T want to eat your fucking water 

2112
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:33,470
down.
We'd.

2113
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:33,780
What are they going to do?
They've got to water it down.

2114
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:36,630
18 percent.
Something like that,

2115
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:38,310
but never fear.
But here's the thing.

2116
01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:41,500
Isn't that strong?
Look at this.

2117
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,580
we've got a da went to.
Oh wow.

2118
01:49:44,581 --> 01:49:45,840
Will you think you're dealing with his 
joy?

2119
01:49:45,850 --> 01:49:47,040
Bananas.
We got state,

2120
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:47,770
federal.

2121
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:50,470
We've got them coming from all over.
You know what I'm saying?

2122
01:49:51,730 --> 01:49:54,430
Damn tea.
Fuck you.

2123
01:49:54,490 --> 01:49:58,210
Just in case,
just in case with tom cruise,

2124
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:03,220
the american made.
I was looking up the medicinal rules in 

2125
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:06,541
Ohio recently.
You can't grow your own there if you 

2126
01:50:06,541 --> 01:50:06,541
have a card.
Yeah,

2127
01:50:06,541 --> 01:50:06,790
they're sneaky with that shit,
right?

2128
01:50:06,910 --> 01:50:11,910
Yeah.
Hopefully people eventually voted that 

2129
01:50:11,910 --> 01:50:11,910
out,
but you had to get it in there first.

2130
01:50:11,910 --> 01:50:12,760
That's the only way It would have 
passed.

2131
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:14,930
They have everything wired up,
but it's a.

2132
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:18,820
It's a victory because it's gonna be 
very difficult to make it illegal.

2133
01:50:18,850 --> 01:50:23,850
Now that it's legal,
it's going to be very difficult to go 

2134
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:26,191
backwards.
So then you have to figure out like why 

2135
01:50:26,191 --> 01:50:28,420
do these companies have a monopoly on 
making it as if it's legal,

2136
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:30,910
why can't you make it yourself?
Aren't tomatoes legal?

2137
01:50:31,090 --> 01:50:32,740
I can grow tomatoes.
Can I.

2138
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,640
You could even probably grow,
like,

2139
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:37,090
do you need a tax stamp or something to 
grow tobacco?

2140
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:40,390
How does that work?
Maybe to sell it.

2141
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:44,500
I don't know.
If you want it to grow your own tobacco,

2142
01:50:44,501 --> 01:50:45,970
would you be able to do that?
Like if you said,

2143
01:50:45,971 --> 01:50:50,110
I want to make my own fucking pipes and 
fill them with my own tobacco,

2144
01:50:50,290 --> 01:50:52,420
I want to make my own cigars.
Could you do that?

2145
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:57,280
It's a possible for personal use.
That's crazy.

2146
01:50:57,281 --> 01:51:02,281
So if you could do that federally and 
then they're saying you can't in Ohio,

2147
01:51:02,441 --> 01:51:06,400
you can't grow your own weed.
That's so stupid.

2148
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:12,200
That's so dumb.
Like you even know what you're doing.

2149
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:15,910
Know I don't know dick about it.
I wouldn't do it,

2150
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:19,270
but you should be able to.
If it's legal,

2151
01:51:19,271 --> 01:51:22,330
of course you should be able to grow it.
That's it's a fucking plant.

2152
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,030
Not blow it.
Where can you not grow?

2153
01:51:25,031 --> 01:51:26,620
In Ohio,
if you have a card,

2154
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:31,800
here's the worry.
The worry is that you wouldn't charge 

2155
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:32,050
taxes.
You would keep the money.

2156
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,060
You wouldn't be accurate.
You just do it with cash.

2157
01:51:34,061 --> 01:51:36,190
You do cash transactions.
That's the worry,

2158
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:40,090
but that would be a tax worry more that.
Right?

2159
01:51:40,091 --> 01:51:41,710
Is that what it is,
what they're saying tobacco to?

2160
01:51:41,711 --> 01:51:43,180
Yeah.
You can grow as much as you want.

2161
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:44,220
You just can't sell it.
Oh,

2162
01:51:44,290 --> 01:51:49,290
okay.
But you did not even allowed to grow 

2163
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:49,290
their own for personal use when it comes
to marijuana,

2164
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:51,220
so it's more restrictive than tobacco,
which is,

2165
01:51:51,221 --> 01:51:54,220
hi larry,
this silly fucks.

2166
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,770
That's so dumb.
Does that make any sense to you?

2167
01:51:58,010 --> 01:52:03,010
Listen,
we have some wacky laws that we let 

2168
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:06,030
sneak through,
like why would you let other people 

2169
01:52:06,030 --> 01:52:08,101
decide that different people in this 
group can't grow a plant that's legal 

2170
01:52:08,651 --> 01:52:10,750
now,
get the fuck outta here.

2171
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:12,940
That's dumb.
That's a dumb rule.

2172
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:17,620
They can't some edibles over a hundred.
No weed.

2173
01:52:17,621 --> 01:52:21,520
That's loose.
So if I come into your store and I go,

2174
01:52:21,521 --> 01:52:26,521
what do you got?
You can open up the container and show 

2175
01:52:26,521 --> 01:52:26,521
me the butter.
Let me smell it.

2176
01:52:27,310 --> 01:52:31,300
They all have to be sealed and stuff.
There's just a lot of silly rules.

2177
01:52:31,301 --> 01:52:32,680
I don't know which one to stay.
Don't.

2178
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:36,280
I'm very happy I found this bag of 
expired.

2179
01:52:36,290 --> 01:52:41,290
Fucking sheba.
Choose to listen.

2180
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:43,690
You know me?
I make it work.

2181
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:46,060
Are they diminished in any way?
No,

2182
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:46,520
no,
no.

2183
01:52:46,570 --> 01:52:47,870
A couple of her.
A little bit of mold.

2184
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:49,450
Donald,
would you just take them old glove?

2185
01:52:49,850 --> 01:52:52,770
I put a little brown nail polish on it 
and nobody knows about that.

2186
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:55,560
Like Who gives a fuck?
A little mold.

2187
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:57,920
never killed.
Nobody motel people.

2188
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:00,570
Penicillin.
Penicillin came from some old,

2189
01:53:00,571 --> 01:53:01,790
didn't it?
Something like that.

2190
01:53:02,590 --> 01:53:07,580
It's so crazy how you see your kids.
You see it with your kids.

2191
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:11,150
I took my kid to science camp and when I
came from Cuba,

2192
01:53:11,151 --> 01:53:16,151
I had a lot of problems medically here 
when I came to this country and one of 

2193
01:53:16,151 --> 01:53:20,861
them was the allergies.
The allergies were completely different 

2194
01:53:20,861 --> 01:53:21,440
than what I was used to.
A different country.

2195
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:24,690
Their fucking mind boggling.
So my allergies.

2196
01:53:24,691 --> 01:53:26,060
Have you ever hit me?
Made that noise?

2197
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:28,970
You ever do that?
Because I don't.

2198
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I can't scratch the back of my throat 
like normal people.

2199
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:37,460
Normal people do that noise.
So you all sealed up up there.

2200
01:53:37,830 --> 01:53:40,790
The first week of camp I saw my daughter
to do shit.

2201
01:53:40,890 --> 01:53:45,890
I felt so bad for her.
She would try to scratch her nose and I 

2202
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:49,961
would see her get frustrated.
Joe rogan just scratching and scratching

2203
01:53:50,361 --> 01:53:54,820
and scratching and now it's three weeks 
in the summer camp.

2204
01:53:54,821 --> 01:53:55,650
She don't scratch.
No.

2205
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:58,970
How come?
Because you build up your immune system.

2206
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:02,690
It's so weird how you see it in front of
you.

2207
01:54:02,691 --> 01:54:04,810
Now you see,
I see.

2208
01:54:04,811 --> 01:54:07,670
I saw in front of me like I went right 
to my wife and I go,

2209
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:12,700
let me tell you something,
you want to take it to the fucking 

2210
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:14,111
doctor and get a fucking tonsils out 
because that's the shit that started 

2211
01:54:14,111 --> 01:54:17,420
with me at that age when I came from 
Cuba right away I was in the hospital on

2212
01:54:17,421 --> 01:54:22,421
a weekly level dog weekly between the 
tonsils and the fucking allergies and 

2213
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:27,850
asthma and the asthma,
but my mother didn't pay attention to 

2214
01:54:27,850 --> 01:54:27,850
the.

2215
01:54:27,850 --> 01:54:31,310
But that's why I don't have it today.
Like I might have bits and pieces,

2216
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:33,680
but I don't have it.
mercy's got it.

2217
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:38,600
My daughter's got it.
They got to do the inhaler and the whole

2218
01:54:38,601 --> 01:54:41,330
thing as most fucking rough.
It's rough.

2219
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:43,880
That's rough.
I've seen people have asthma attacks and

2220
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:47,090
you can hear the wheezing and you have 
no fucking idea.

2221
01:54:47,091 --> 01:54:49,070
So I have to work it from a different 
angle.

2222
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:51,050
What can,
what can they do?

2223
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:54,080
LIke if someone doesn't have an inhaler 
and they have an asthma attack,

2224
01:54:54,630 --> 01:54:58,520
a strategy or technique referenced and 
mother fucking party.

2225
01:54:58,550 --> 01:55:03,550
Oh no.
So you have to be like,

2226
01:55:03,690 --> 01:55:06,860
I was having a party right there.
Have a great tIme.

2227
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:12,020
I got an estimate.
Their inhaler opens up your lungs,

2228
01:55:12,870 --> 01:55:15,770
children,
my wife has the machine,

2229
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:21,550
the machine,
the machine that blows some powder in 

2230
01:55:21,550 --> 01:55:24,951
there with a thing.
And then there's a regular machine that 

2231
01:55:24,951 --> 01:55:24,951
my wife has.
And then she has dna.

2232
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:26,790
Uh,
you know,

2233
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:30,440
my wife and her doctor been working on 
different things.

2234
01:55:30,441 --> 01:55:32,360
She's healthy kids.
Healthy is fuck.

2235
01:55:32,361 --> 01:55:34,270
She runs,
she swims jujitsu.

2236
01:55:34,630 --> 01:55:35,900
That ballet,
you know,

2237
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,210
it's,
it's four days a week.

2238
01:55:38,211 --> 01:55:40,250
We don't stop at that fucking house.
You know,

2239
01:55:40,251 --> 01:55:41,270
you just,
you see it,

2240
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:44,000
you know people.
I love these people that

2241
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:44,820
say,
oh,

2242
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:48,660
let's meet at 3:30.
You tell your mother ministry 33,

2243
01:55:48,670 --> 01:55:52,930

saying I'm writing jokes at eight that.

2244
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:54,840
Because I want that because that's what 
I got.

2245
01:55:55,030 --> 01:55:56,550
Yeah,
that's what I got.

2246
01:55:56,580 --> 01:55:58,750
That's what I got because I got this,
that,

2247
01:55:58,800 --> 01:55:59,340
this,
that,

2248
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:04,750
and at 3:00
from monday to friday this different 

2249
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:06,210

Sometimes you do three at a time,

2250
01:56:06,211 --> 01:56:08,460
bro.
We gonna write from jujitsu right to the

2251
01:56:08,461 --> 01:56:09,630
pool.
When she jumps in,

2252
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:14,070
you think we could do me then go for 45 
minutes.

2253
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:16,260
Fuck you,
jack.

2254
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:17,670
You gotta.
See it.

2255
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:19,170
It's unbelievable.
People like,

2256
01:56:19,171 --> 01:56:20,580
nah,
let's meet.

2257
01:56:20,610 --> 01:56:23,130
Fuck you.
I got ballet.

2258
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:26,070
I got a thousand fucking activities 
during the week.

2259
01:56:26,130 --> 01:56:30,420
Kids are little energy machine and if 
you don't burn that energy then you deal

2260
01:56:30,421 --> 01:56:35,421
with it and from seven to nine when you 
fucking trying to do your own shit and 

2261
01:56:35,421 --> 01:56:37,230
trying to get it together,
they're just constantly ready to go.

2262
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:42,290
THey're ready to go.
A couple of weeks ago she took her to 

2263
01:56:42,290 --> 01:56:43,140
the fucking zoo.
Six hour walk around la zoo.

2264
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:44,960
I get home at four.
He's like,

2265
01:56:44,970 --> 01:56:46,350
what's the story?
We're going to the park.

2266
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:49,040
I looked at my wife like park,
took it to the park,

2267
01:56:49,090 --> 01:56:53,430
two hours on the monkey bars and then 
another hour at the fucking yogurt place

2268
01:56:53,431 --> 01:56:57,650
jumpIng up and down to music and Michael
Jackson and drawing pictures.

2269
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:06,430
Really?
It's crazy being a fucking debt 

2270
01:57:06,430 --> 01:57:06,430
especially because then I'll know I 
kidnap some bio.

2271
01:57:06,430 --> 01:57:07,430
She's.
She has no idea.

2272
01:57:07,431 --> 01:57:09,050
She has no idea.
I'm a savage,

2273
01:57:09,530 --> 01:57:12,580
so she thinks I'm on the up and up,
like when we go to church and shit,

2274
01:57:12,590 --> 01:57:13,430
she's like,
daddy,

2275
01:57:13,431 --> 01:57:15,280
look at jesus as well.

2276
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:18,090
Nothing turns people more on the up and 
up.

2277
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:20,400
then being a father,
it really does.

2278
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:21,720
Yeah.
It changes who you are.

2279
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:25,220
You're responsible for these people now 
and you just do.

2280
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:28,590
You have to think of things differently.
You have to make sure that you provide.

2281
01:57:28,610 --> 01:57:30,840
Do you have To make sure that they're 
taken care of?

2282
01:57:30,841 --> 01:57:32,130
You've got to give them love.
It's like,

2283
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:38,030
ooh,
it's an intense world and you feel more 

2284
01:57:38,030 --> 01:57:40,311
vulnerable and it's just the whole world
around you opens up and you also have 

2285
01:57:41,461 --> 01:57:46,461
more empathy.
I have way more empathy for people now 

2286
01:57:46,461 --> 01:57:47,640
because I'm becoming.
You know,

2287
01:57:47,641 --> 01:57:52,641
as you're raising children,
you're seeIng how they develop and then 

2288
01:57:53,581 --> 01:57:58,581
you considering how other people have 
been mistreated and how things have gone

2289
01:58:00,390 --> 01:58:05,390
terribly wrong.
They've been abused and beaten and 

2290
01:58:05,390 --> 01:58:05,820
fucked up and then left and terrible 
situations,

2291
01:58:05,821 --> 01:58:10,821
and you realize that so much of what 
happens with people with even terrible 

2292
01:58:13,441 --> 01:58:18,441
behavior comes from other terrible 
behavior like they didn't get a chance 

2293
01:58:18,441 --> 01:58:21,861
to stop the cycle and there are a lot of
people that we consider like really bad 

2294
01:58:22,471 --> 01:58:24,030
people,
violent people,

2295
01:58:24,031 --> 01:58:29,031
people that do terrible things that we 
don't even realize that so many of them 

2296
01:58:29,031 --> 01:58:33,890
are product of violence,
like they're a product of someone doing 

2297
01:58:33,890 --> 01:58:33,890
it to them like they've.

2298
01:58:33,890 --> 01:58:38,870
They've almost,
they're trying to get back at the world 

2299
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:41,390
for all the horrible shit that's been 
done to them and there was no one there 

2300
01:58:41,390 --> 01:58:41,470
to put a stop to it.
There was no one there to save them.

2301
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:46,030
There was no one there to protect them 
and this is what we're seeing.

2302
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:51,060
When we see fucked up people,
we always just think of it as fucked up 

2303
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:54,781
people would.
That fucked up person is the product of 

2304
01:58:54,781 --> 01:58:55,120
some terrible things that have happened 
to them.

2305
01:58:55,121 --> 01:58:57,550
Almost universally.
Almost every angry,

2306
01:58:57,551 --> 01:59:02,551
fucked up person has come from a place 
where something has gone really wrong 

2307
01:59:02,551 --> 01:59:02,770
against them.
You don't,

2308
01:59:02,830 --> 01:59:05,230
you're not angry and fucked up.
If everything's awesome,

2309
01:59:05,530 --> 01:59:10,530
if every day just get an ice cream,
getting your dick sucked and driving a 

2310
01:59:10,530 --> 01:59:11,920
ferrari and watching awesome movies like
you know,

2311
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:13,000
it's,
you,

2312
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:18,150
there's a,
there's an anger that some people have 

2313
01:59:18,150 --> 01:59:20,940
violent criminals in particular that 
comes from someone doing that to them.

2314
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:27,760
I had a job.
I know you had that anger from 1979.

2315
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:32,460
You had that shit when I met you.
I had that angle.

2316
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:34,260
But no,
the met you.

2317
01:59:34,261 --> 01:59:35,990
I've seen it.
I've seen it with people.

2318
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,460
Let me explain some to wanted to attack 
people.

2319
01:59:39,110 --> 01:59:42,630
Anger was very,
uh alright.

2320
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:44,010
First of all,
under control.

2321
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:49,020
I was always a happy kid and,
but not really because I was always 

2322
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:53,401
confused about the death of my father.
So had always had a little certain 

2323
01:59:53,401 --> 01:59:53,401
unhappiness.
Yeah.

2324
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:59,100
But I always had the catholic faith.
I was really raised catholic and I 

2325
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:03,541
always believed he was in the habit that
he was in that box from my mom did the 

2326
02:00:03,541 --> 02:00:05,080
things,
so at ease the pain a little bit.

2327
02:00:05,081 --> 02:00:10,081
Then my mother's death was just fucking 
horrifying and that broke the central 

2328
02:00:11,441 --> 02:00:16,441
nervous system belief system that broke 
your belief in the world.

2329
02:00:17,530 --> 02:00:22,530
how can there be a god that takes a 
mother away from a chIld when you're 16 

2330
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:27,640
and you wrap that around?
Your head does not a good result.

2331
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:31,710
It's not going to be a good result.
So how I lashed out with,

2332
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:35,800
by robin you,
that was the only weapon I had world was

2333
02:00:35,801 --> 02:00:36,400
to rob you.

2334
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:37,870
Joe rogan,
fucktard,

2335
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:42,900
me.
The studio will get robbed and lit on 

2336
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:43,180
fucking fire and joe knew was me.
And what the fuck was he going to do?

2337
02:00:43,181 --> 02:00:46,650
I'm,
we combine the fuck you going to do it?

2338
02:00:46,690 --> 02:00:49,720
Call the cops.
I'm going to answer the phone next time.

2339
02:00:49,721 --> 02:00:51,910
Don't fuck with me.
You know,

2340
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:56,911
next time when I tell you to give me 
that grandma coke and I'll pay you on 

2341
02:00:56,911 --> 02:00:57,490
friday,
you'll give it to me,

2342
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:59,200
right?
Because that's what it was.

2343
02:00:59,201 --> 02:01:00,650
IT was simple shit like that,
right?

2344
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:04,120
Like joe,
give me 100 bucks or $100 bucks.

2345
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:05,560
Okay,
now rob,

2346
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:07,870
your fucking house should have given him
100 bucks.

2347
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:13,350
You know,
I was lashing out at the fucking world 

2348
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:14,860
number two.
The other issue I had is I lost a child.

2349
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:19,510
I lost the job.
I was not ready for that child at all.

2350
02:01:19,511 --> 02:01:21,400
I love that little girl with all my 
heart,

2351
02:01:21,401 --> 02:01:25,030
but I was not ready for her at all.
My intentions are good,

2352
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:30,450
but the result was not going to be well.
I was noT ready and because I lost that 

2353
02:01:30,851 --> 02:01:33,790
child and I'm a no contact with that 
child,

2354
02:01:33,850 --> 02:01:36,130
it makes me a better father than I am 
today.

2355
02:01:36,730 --> 02:01:38,500
This is never going to happen to me 
again.

2356
02:01:38,890 --> 02:01:39,860
You understand me?

2357
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:42,920
I see.
I see the,

2358
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:48,250
we see daughters of comics,
we've seen daughters of comments and 

2359
02:01:48,841 --> 02:01:53,780
sons of comics and if fucking lost,
you know,

2360
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:58,960
I don't want my daughter to be fucking 
lost and that stupidity in that world,

2361
02:01:59,540 --> 02:02:01,960
you know,
you have to be that job.

2362
02:02:02,030 --> 02:02:03,750
We have to be there.
Yeah.

2363
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:08,770
You know,
I'm trying to be there as much as I can 

2364
02:02:08,770 --> 02:02:10,580
be engaged.
You have to be engaged.

2365
02:02:10,581 --> 02:02:12,930
Were your parents engaged as much as 
you're engaged?

2366
02:02:12,931 --> 02:02:15,590
In my mind,
but I didn't want a different world.

2367
02:02:15,591 --> 02:02:16,640
Yes,
it's a different world,

2368
02:02:16,641 --> 02:02:18,870
but my parents were very openminded 
what?

2369
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:21,600
What my parents gave to me that was 
really important was they.

2370
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:25,760
They are like the most nonjudgmental,
non racist,

2371
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:30,260
non homophobic people ever.
They don't judge about anything.

2372
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:31,720
They were hippies.
You know?

2373
02:02:31,790 --> 02:02:36,790
When my mom met my stepdad,
he had crazy long hair and he had it 

2374
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:38,150
like all are all too.

2375
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:40,600
I was like almost in high school.
It was when he cut,

2376
02:02:40,610 --> 02:02:42,380
I was so happy when he caught it.
I was like,

2377
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:49,270
people were.
It was like back then dudes grew their 

2378
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:49,270
hair long.
They were hippies,

2379
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:53,680
like legit hippies.
But because of that I was raised around 

2380
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:56,540
like no racism,
no homophobic.

2381
02:02:56,870 --> 02:02:59,360
We had a no homophobic thoughts in our 
house.

2382
02:02:59,361 --> 02:03:00,290
We never.
That never came up.

2383
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:04,700
We lIved in san francisco from the time 
I was seven until I was 11.

2384
02:03:05,690 --> 02:03:08,360
We lived on a series gate and the one 
thing that did disturb me though,

2385
02:03:08,361 --> 02:03:13,361
once I was walking with my stepdad,
some dude whistle that adam was like,

2386
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:21,740
I knew the dudes were gay,
but there's a thing about when a dude is

2387
02:03:21,741 --> 02:03:24,230
hitting on your straight stepdad and 
you're like,

2388
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:26,870
oh my goodness,
this is ridiculous.

2389
02:03:26,871 --> 02:03:30,620
Like guys are growth.
It makes you realize,

2390
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:34,490
doesn't even really make you realize 
what it would like to be a chicken.

2391
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:38,030
That same exact grew up completely 
different.

2392
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:41,960
Not in my home,
not my home,

2393
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:45,460
but the surrounding.
You know,

2394
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:50,530
when I would walk down the corner,
mr tina and we'll go pick a rule where 

2395
02:03:50,530 --> 02:03:50,530
you going,
you know,

2396
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:54,530
there was a kid and I still talk to him 
on facebook.

2397
02:03:54,860 --> 02:03:59,030
His name was louis and in this he's 
dominican cho,

2398
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:01,310
he's dominican,
he's dominican.

2399
02:04:01,610 --> 02:04:06,610
They didn't give a fuck.
They called him louie the nigga 

2400
02:04:06,610 --> 02:04:06,610
constantly,
louis the negativity.

2401
02:04:06,610 --> 02:04:07,370
The guys,
he's dominican.

2402
02:04:07,790 --> 02:04:09,890
If they gave a fuck,
they didn't give a fuck.

2403
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:11,660
They didn't give a fuck.
So funny.

2404
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:16,750
You know,
they didn't give a fuck a pro or just 

2405
02:04:16,750 --> 02:04:16,750
different than.
It's a different world.

2406
02:04:16,750 --> 02:04:19,760
We're talking about right.
I remember there was a kid that is today

2407
02:04:19,761 --> 02:04:21,440
gay.
I still talk to him.

2408
02:04:21,441 --> 02:04:23,350
He's my brother.
As a matter of fact,

2409
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:25,520
he's one of my brothers.
I gotta be honest with you.

2410
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:28,520
He lives in miami.
He's got hiv.

2411
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:29,540
I mean,
listen,

2412
02:04:29,541 --> 02:04:31,430
if you didn't know he was gay when he 
was 12,

2413
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:35,660
there's something wrong with you.
Ms dot tina used to call him.

2414
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:38,100
He was lightened the slippers looking.

2415
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:40,150
Look at jimmy,
he's white and this slip is,

2416
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,630
you know,
and you had to sit there and take it.

2417
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:47,160
It was whatever.
It should be.

2418
02:04:47,161 --> 02:04:49,350
Okay.
for a little jimmy lightness slippers.

2419
02:04:49,351 --> 02:04:51,720
Everybody should just let him be who he 
was.

2420
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:55,350
He had a dog named tramp that wouldn't 
have his dog ever.

2421
02:04:55,540 --> 02:05:00,540
He lived outside tramp skin.
Like when you pet the fucking thing was 

2422
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:01,380
the hardest.
It was like a,

2423
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:04,140
like with those brushes you scrub the 
metal brush,

2424
02:05:04,710 --> 02:05:07,440
like you've lived outside tramp.
But he followed him everywhere.

2425
02:05:07,441 --> 02:05:10,920
He was beautiful.
I love dogs,

2426
02:05:11,860 --> 02:05:15,570
but you're very lucky because I did the 
best.

2427
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:20,640
I grew up in an environment standing 
with you when my man on the corner,

2428
02:05:20,641 --> 02:05:23,380
we see a trans gender person crossed 
mystery,

2429
02:05:23,410 --> 02:05:25,230
like look at the shape of this fucking 
guy.

2430
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:30,180
As simple as that is as a judgment,
but that judgment,

2431
02:05:30,570 --> 02:05:32,220
but it was more of a sense of humor.

2432
02:05:32,870 --> 02:05:35,240
You know,
before we were looking at a picture of a

2433
02:05:35,790 --> 02:05:40,790
of archie bunker,
America understood it because he knew 

2434
02:05:40,790 --> 02:05:43,530
where he was coming from.
He wasn't saying nothing malicious.

2435
02:05:44,070 --> 02:05:49,070
It was a world where he came from and 
the idea was that he was reluctantly 

2436
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:52,770
open to occasionally taking new 
information.

2437
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:58,820
Today,
every guy's sItting at home fucking 

2438
02:05:58,820 --> 02:05:58,820
looking at a window,
pick him,

2439
02:05:58,820 --> 02:05:59,810
waiting to fuck him to get me.
Dude,

2440
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:05,680
there's a thousand men at home waiting 
right now to get me fucking to everyday 

2441
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:06,810
a new guy get called out for something 
like that.

2442
02:06:07,290 --> 02:06:09,210
What's this going to be like in five 
years?

2443
02:06:09,211 --> 02:06:11,340
Nobody's going to be able to even ask 
for fucking piece,

2444
02:06:12,460 --> 02:06:13,820
right?
Nobody's going to go,

2445
02:06:13,830 --> 02:06:15,030
hey,
let me give you a little stab.

2446
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:17,670
Let me give you a little buckaloo wish.
I think

2447
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:24,270
going to come a time and then I don't 
think it's going to be very long within 

2448
02:06:24,270 --> 02:06:26,950
10 years where we're going to be able to
read each other's minds.

2449
02:06:27,340 --> 02:06:32,340
I think we're going to be able to 
communicate in a different way and I 

2450
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:36,151
think it's just going to be step one 
into some sort of a technological world 

2451
02:06:36,430 --> 02:06:41,430
where we all read each other's minds.
We can connect together and some almost 

2452
02:06:41,430 --> 02:06:43,150
like telepathic web way.
The way you use a.

2453
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:48,540
This is obviously just an idea,
but I think that if technology continues

2454
02:06:50,861 --> 02:06:52,810
to give us closer and closer access to 
people,

2455
02:06:52,811 --> 02:06:57,811
we're gonna lose all boundaries between 
what a person is and you're going to 

2456
02:06:57,811 --> 02:07:01,771
know everything about everyone's past 
and everyone's going to know everything 

2457
02:07:01,771 --> 02:07:04,030
about yours and it's going to be like 
some unlimited library of the mind.

2458
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:06,340
You can.
You can travel through anyone's mind and

2459
02:07:06,341 --> 02:07:11,341
read anyone's thoughts and as hundred 
years goes by and the technology gets 

2460
02:07:11,341 --> 02:07:12,940
better and a thousand years go by,
we're going to integrate.

2461
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:17,290
We're gonna fIgure out a way whether 
it's in our grandchildren's lifetimes or

2462
02:07:17,291 --> 02:07:22,291
their grandchildren's lifetimes.
And I think that cultural shifts and 

2463
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:25,690
things that are happening in the news 
and people waking up to things that they

2464
02:07:25,691 --> 02:07:30,040
think are horrible and people trying to 
correct the misdeeds of the past.

2465
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:35,400
All of that is us waking up in the 
middle of our culture and trying to 

2466
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:42,060
figure out what's right,
figuring out what's the healthy way to 

2467
02:07:42,060 --> 02:07:42,880
move forward,
figure balance this thing out.

2468
02:07:43,340 --> 02:07:45,550
Slow down.
What are we doing?

2469
02:07:45,730 --> 02:07:50,730
We're waking up as grown adults trying 
to figure out our system and there's 

2470
02:07:50,730 --> 02:07:52,930
some injustices.
Those injustices have to be corrected or

2471
02:07:52,931 --> 02:07:57,931
at least recognized.
We have to understand what's the 

2472
02:07:57,931 --> 02:08:00,541
difference between normal male female 
interaction and what sexual harassment.

2473
02:08:02,170 --> 02:08:04,510
What when is it when someone doesn't 
want you to do it,

2474
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:09,750
when does it become a crime and you 
don't want your daughter to ever 

2475
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:13,141
experienced that and I don't want 
anybody that's a woman to experience 

2476
02:08:13,141 --> 02:08:16,531
real sexual harassment.
It's the worst fucking thing that could 

2477
02:08:16,531 --> 02:08:19,741
probably ever happen to you because you 
can't do anything physically about it 

2478
02:08:19,741 --> 02:08:21,940
other than rape or being beaten up or 
murdered too creepy place to be in.

2479
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:28,050
I've had guys hit on me before.
Have you ever had a guy hit on you 

2480
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:28,050
before?
We use.

2481
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:28,820
Where is this going?
I was like 13.

2482
02:08:30,140 --> 02:08:32,930
I didn't know what to do.
I ran out of the car and it was my fault

2483
02:08:32,931 --> 02:08:37,931
for getting in the fucking car.
I also acknowledged it never fucking 

2484
02:08:37,931 --> 02:08:40,190
happened again and I would go to gay 
this when I was a kid,

2485
02:08:40,191 --> 02:08:44,240
like we thought it was a joke to go to a
fucking porn theater on a sunday.

2486
02:08:44,241 --> 02:08:49,241
Here we got to a point on a sunday,
like we're stupid friends and going to 

2487
02:08:49,241 --> 02:08:52,780
the bathroom and there's always a guy 
that gets next to you in the store when 

2488
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:53,540
you go pick and it looks at your dick 
and he smiles.

2489
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:56,420
Come on guys.
I bumped into a lot of creep.

2490
02:08:56,510 --> 02:08:58,340
You been out here.
first of all,

2491
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:01,880
I tell you what bothers me about the 
current situation now.

2492
02:09:01,881 --> 02:09:06,881
Went off that this fucking place.
He has always been a fucking haven for 

2493
02:09:06,881 --> 02:09:06,881
sexual harassment.

2494
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:11,920
This fucking neighbor down the corridor 
here in hollywood is with sexual 

2495
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:12,200
harassment.
Got invented.

2496
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:13,550
Did you ever see,
um,

2497
02:09:13,610 --> 02:09:18,100
all the stuff about fatty arbuckle?
I heard pieces about fattier but,

2498
02:09:18,110 --> 02:09:23,110
but I don't need to know about fatty.
I know about a chick named Marilyn 

2499
02:09:23,110 --> 02:09:23,860
Monroe that they passed around,
so they killed the,

2500
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:25,850
I know about a game,
a liberace.

2501
02:09:26,210 --> 02:09:31,210
We used to suck his dick and fucking 
clean you out and then send you out the 

2502
02:09:31,210 --> 02:09:32,870
fucking cold and worse get plastic 
surgery.

2503
02:09:32,871 --> 02:09:37,871
So you looked like you look like him,
but is one of the most intense things a 

2504
02:09:37,961 --> 02:09:40,160
person's ever made a person to.
Let me tell you something.

2505
02:09:40,700 --> 02:09:44,840
Let me tell you something else too.
That's while we welcome the elephants in

2506
02:09:44,841 --> 02:09:49,841
the room.
The fucking we hang out was known for 

2507
02:09:49,841 --> 02:09:49,950
comedy.
Fucking hell of them.

2508
02:09:50,350 --> 02:09:52,910
Convicted a lot of years.
The comedy store,

2509
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:55,680
a lot of dick sucker went down to 
fucking calm you store.

2510
02:09:55,940 --> 02:09:58,160
I don't know how long harvey weinstein 
been around,

2511
02:09:58,490 --> 02:10:03,490
but there's a song by the eagles in 1980
that was released on the fucking long 

2512
02:10:03,490 --> 02:10:06,050
run than last.
Now it's called the king of hollywood on

2513
02:10:06,051 --> 02:10:07,340
the way home.
Put it on.

2514
02:10:07,341 --> 02:10:09,830
listen to it in the car.
You're going to crash your car,

2515
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:13,490
called the king of fucking hollywood and
you're going to go,

2516
02:10:13,491 --> 02:10:14,510
hold on.
Fuck.

2517
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:17,980
Were they talking about?
I have to assume I'm going to.

2518
02:10:17,981 --> 02:10:22,981
It just breaks it down.
It would be a shame to see all that 

2519
02:10:22,981 --> 02:10:25,640
talent go to waste.
You know?

2520
02:10:25,641 --> 02:10:30,050
What are you willing to sacrifice would 
really be just nice.

2521
02:10:30,890 --> 02:10:31,370
Oh,
you got.

2522
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:34,430
Look at this shit down here beside me.
Honey.

2523
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:39,470
Let's have a little heart to heart.
That's the fucking lyrics to this song.

2524
02:10:39,950 --> 02:10:41,090
Well,
Kenya,

2525
02:10:41,190 --> 02:10:42,560
hollywood,
1980.

2526
02:10:42,561 --> 02:10:45,530
Nobody knew.
Now look at me and tell me,

2527
02:10:45,531 --> 02:10:47,750
darlene,
how badly do you want this part?

2528
02:10:48,490 --> 02:10:53,490
Yeah.
What's listened to put men in positions 

2529
02:10:53,490 --> 02:10:53,490
of power and hiring women like that and 
that,

2530
02:10:53,490 --> 02:10:58,320
that crazy position of what you're 
trying to cast something and you've got 

2531
02:10:58,320 --> 02:10:59,540
a hundred people that want it so bad and
you're.

2532
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:02,630
You know,
you're some creepy dudes.

2533
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:07,660
Some people actually think this would 
change their life if I came to you right

2534
02:11:08,691 --> 02:11:09,870
now,
Joe rogan.

2535
02:11:09,950 --> 02:11:12,050
You're fucking delivering papers in 
boston.

2536
02:11:13,670 --> 02:11:17,630
You'd have to show her podcast.
There's all you to do is look my fucking

2537
02:11:17,650 --> 02:11:18,660
bowl.
Oh my goodness.

2538
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:21,920
Just swap one time,
but I want you to.

2539
02:11:21,921 --> 02:11:24,560
Do I want you to do that thing at the 
end.

2540
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:25,590
like a dice?
Yeah.

2541
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:30,620
Like would you do it?
How much think,

2542
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:35,030
how much do I get and how long do I have
to suck them for?

2543
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:37,610
Did he says it's going to be over pretty
quick.

2544
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:42,060
This is the career changer.
If I may do this,

2545
02:11:42,061 --> 02:11:42,740
do that.
Right?

2546
02:11:43,090 --> 02:11:44,130
That's who they're talking about.
Oh,

2547
02:11:44,210 --> 02:11:48,520
the king of hollywood.
It was clark gable a um,

2548
02:11:49,070 --> 02:11:51,200
was he a gay man?
It was based off a book.

2549
02:11:52,130 --> 02:11:53,720
Apparently all this stuff that was in 
there,

2550
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:57,230
but he was,
he alleged to be a gay man.

2551
02:11:57,600 --> 02:11:58,440
Is this.

2552
02:12:00,470 --> 02:12:05,470
But there was also a book released in 
hollywood in 1997 or eight called.

2553
02:12:05,781 --> 02:12:07,370
You'll never work in this town again.
Oh.

2554
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:10,160
So those lyrics were about clark gable.
Yo,

2555
02:12:10,220 --> 02:12:11,960
I'm sorry.
I thought it was something.

2556
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:12,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

2557
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:16,940
But then there was a book released in 
1997 or eight in this hollywood called.

2558
02:12:16,941 --> 02:12:21,941
You'll never work in this town again.
And there was about a chick who 

2559
02:12:21,941 --> 02:12:25,481
described her sexual relationships with 
a bunch of people in town and she 

2560
02:12:25,481 --> 02:12:28,880
described it was fucking don henley,
the drummer from the eagles,

2561
02:12:28,881 --> 02:12:32,480
the guy that sings and he would get 
hooked us to come up to the house,

2562
02:12:33,470 --> 02:12:36,620
wouldn't even talk to them,
but why them up,

2563
02:12:37,340 --> 02:12:39,020
turn around,
don't even look at me,

2564
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:42,320
don't even make fucking eye contact on 
me.

2565
02:12:42,350 --> 02:12:45,190
They understand me.
Bend over.

2566
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:51,280
So he would sIt on the couch,
we road bond with his dick out snorting 

2567
02:12:52,851 --> 02:12:56,000
coke and they would all be in front of a
fireplace.

2568
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,470
Breadth over,
where'd you hear this?

2569
02:12:57,530 --> 02:13:00,470
Because this book will never work in 
this town again.

2570
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:04,290
Jesus christ.
And he would fuck it.

2571
02:13:04,310 --> 02:13:06,330
You never eat lunch at this time again.
Oh,

2572
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:08,090
you never eat lunch.
And he would take the thing,

2573
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:12,230
do a line of coke,
get up and walk up to one of them,

2574
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:16,820
spread them,
putting them in their ass a little bit.

2575
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:18,770
Firstly,
puppet twice,

2576
02:13:18,771 --> 02:13:20,420
and then go,
I'll be back in five minutes.

2577
02:13:20,770 --> 02:13:23,660
and then he would go sit down,
put his feet up,

2578
02:13:23,661 --> 02:13:26,510
do another line.
And he would do that for eight hours,

2579
02:13:27,090 --> 02:13:32,090
just get up,
fuck one for five minutes and sit back 

2580
02:13:32,090 --> 02:13:34,661
then before he'd come.
So he would never crack a nut and he 

2581
02:13:34,661 --> 02:13:36,810
would just keep going to keep a heart on
a live fucking.

2582
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:39,060
Who the fuck knows?
Listen,

2583
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:44,090
you know,
it's like they all through the harvey 

2584
02:13:44,090 --> 02:13:44,090
under the bus.

2585
02:13:44,090 --> 02:13:45,840
But these animaLs had been doing this,
says jesus loves chicago.

2586
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:51,770
Since jesus miss chicago,
this one I read that article about the 

2587
02:13:51,770 --> 02:13:52,490
cuban superman that they brand them with
sleeping,

2588
02:13:52,491 --> 02:13:57,491
with what they blatantly talked about In
our article was exactly what we're 

2589
02:13:58,801 --> 02:14:03,801
seeing today.
only behind closed doors that Cuba had 

2590
02:14:03,801 --> 02:14:07,791
become a haven for sex.
Where you couLd go see a fucking go get 

2591
02:14:07,791 --> 02:14:11,901
fucked.
They passed a rule thIs week in Mexico 

2592
02:14:11,901 --> 02:14:12,690
that a girl could get fucked up.
she's 12 years old.

2593
02:14:13,410 --> 02:14:14,960
You really need that room.
Really?

2594
02:14:14,970 --> 02:14:19,290
That's the rule.
You need something that you Could be the

2595
02:14:19,290 --> 02:14:21,170
age.
12 years old is an act of,

2596
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:22,820
and this is Mexico,
Mexico,

2597
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:26,340
james,
12 years,

2598
02:14:26,370 --> 02:14:29,490
12 fucking years old when he just as a 
woman,

2599
02:14:29,491 --> 02:14:31,170
12 years old.
That's insane.

2600
02:14:31,230 --> 02:14:32,010
That's insane.
It's

2601
02:14:32,590 --> 02:14:36,710
scary it.
Oh jeez,

2602
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:38,890
you fucking believe that.
oh my god,

2603
02:14:38,891 --> 02:14:43,891
look at this.
The federal law established at the age 

2604
02:14:43,891 --> 02:14:46,201
of 12 as the minimum age of consent,
while the age at which there are no 

2605
02:14:46,201 --> 02:14:49,861
restrictions for consensual sexual 
activities is 18 sex with someone 12 to 

2606
02:14:49,861 --> 02:14:54,601
18 is not illegal per se,
but can still be open to prosecution 

2607
02:14:54,601 --> 02:14:55,980
under certain circumstances.
He really.

2608
02:14:56,230 --> 02:14:57,710
What does that mean?
So It's,

2609
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:02,710
it's age 12 is the age of minimum age of
consent,

2610
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:07,150
but the age in which there are no 
restrictions for consensual sex is 18.

2611
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:10,900
So the idea is that sex between someone 
who's 12 and 18,

2612
02:15:11,740 --> 02:15:15,370
it's not illegal,
but they might be able to lock you up if

2613
02:15:15,371 --> 02:15:18,520
you do something super creepy.
That is nuts,

2614
02:15:18,521 --> 02:15:23,521
man.
You imagine if there was some person 

2615
02:15:23,521 --> 02:15:26,761
that just only went after 12 years,
is that the United States or Mexico?

2616
02:15:28,190 --> 02:15:30,230
It's Mexico,
so that's why people would fly down.

2617
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:35,390
Actually I typed it in Mexico,
but this is an article on wikipedia 

2618
02:15:35,390 --> 02:15:37,210
about aging consent in north America.
Why federal law?

2619
02:15:37,211 --> 02:15:38,410
So I'll find out,
wait a minute,

2620
02:15:38,411 --> 02:15:40,570
that what I just read was about north 
America.

2621
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:43,210
How is that real?
I just saw north America too,

2622
02:15:43,211 --> 02:15:44,740
and that's why I asked her states.
Right?

2623
02:15:44,820 --> 02:15:46,270
I'm sorry.
Not in north America.

2624
02:15:46,271 --> 02:15:47,640
United states of America.
Right?

2625
02:15:47,660 --> 02:15:49,030
North americas,
Canada to.

2626
02:15:49,540 --> 02:15:50,430
That is,
that is uh,

2627
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:52,750
that is not possible thing.
How is it?

2628
02:15:53,350 --> 02:15:58,350
Is that really possible?
The 12 can be the age of consent 

2629
02:15:58,350 --> 02:15:58,930
anywhere.
What are you talking about?

2630
02:15:58,931 --> 02:16:00,200
That's crazy.
18,

2631
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:01,980
right?
That's the federal law of Mexico.

2632
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:03,910
Mexico.
He scared the shit out of me.

2633
02:16:03,911 --> 02:16:06,370
Jamie.
Here in America.

2634
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:07,760
It's not yet.
Yes.

2635
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:09,700
That's what the article is about.
North America.

2636
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:11,410
Age of consent in north America.

2637
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:16,920
And there is states here where it's 
lower than like there's a couple.

2638
02:16:18,341 --> 02:16:20,440
I believe it's 14.
Dude.

2639
02:16:20,441 --> 02:16:22,700
Is that real?
It might've changed it.

2640
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:24,670
Okay.
So 12 for the ones.

2641
02:16:25,450 --> 02:16:28,780
The 12 are the ones that were in white,
which is,

2642
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:30,990
that's in Mexico right here.
Yeah.

2643
02:16:31,030 --> 02:16:36,030
Okay.
There are spots and all the way up the 

2644
02:16:36,030 --> 02:16:36,030
coast.
Right?

2645
02:16:36,030 --> 02:16:36,920
You have,
that's still Mexico done here.

2646
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:38,440
Yeah.
That side.

2647
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:40,940
But that,
that whole thing is 12 years old.

2648
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:44,140
Is the age of consent a blue is all 16.
who?

2649
02:16:44,170 --> 02:16:45,920
That's a lot of states.
16.

2650
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:47,680
Yeah.
That's kind of crazy.

2651
02:16:49,830 --> 02:16:54,370
A lot of fucking us dates.
That's crazy.

2652
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:55,690
14.
18 central.

2653
02:16:55,780 --> 02:17:00,130
Excuse me.
was this say central America slash 14 to

2654
02:17:00,131 --> 02:17:01,780
18 and central America.
Interesting.

2655
02:17:02,110 --> 02:17:04,780
That's that age of consent thing is 
bananas.

2656
02:17:04,930 --> 02:17:09,220
Go back to that little map again please.
That is weird to look at.

2657
02:17:09,670 --> 02:17:12,970
I would have thought there would be way 
less of those 16.

2658
02:17:12,971 --> 02:17:16,450
Look how many sixteens there are and 
what are the darker ones?

2659
02:17:16,451 --> 02:17:18,700
Can you scroll all the way down so we 
could see the whole scale?

2660
02:17:18,820 --> 02:17:22,510
So 17.
Is that around and then wow.

2661
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:27,460
Tax green is 18.
So like Florida,

2662
02:17:27,461 --> 02:17:30,340
California is less greens in there are 
blues more.

2663
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:33,750
The age of consent is 16.
Is this current,

2664
02:17:35,180 --> 02:17:37,220
is that possible?
This is not current.

2665
02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:42,000
It seems not.
Alaska 16 to.

2666
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:44,830
I assumed it was all

2667
02:17:45,720 --> 02:17:50,720
Florida was like eight.
You know Florida could be like seven,

2668
02:17:52,890 --> 02:17:55,260
six and a half.
You never know that.

2669
02:17:55,261 --> 02:17:59,040
I'm fucking that crazy place.
That is a fucking crazy place.

2670
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:04,110
That's where white people go to boogie.
An interesting.

2671
02:18:05,790 --> 02:18:10,790
I just found out about,
it was a time you go down and just buy 

2672
02:18:10,790 --> 02:18:11,880
pills over the counter or something.
Go pain.

2673
02:18:11,881 --> 02:18:13,460
Doctors.
Pain medication.

2674
02:18:13,461 --> 02:18:18,461
Yeah.
Like I just read this shit recently 

2675
02:18:18,461 --> 02:18:18,461
that,
that,

2676
02:18:18,461 --> 02:18:19,710
that law got abolished something.
That's why so many people left Florida.

2677
02:18:20,070 --> 02:18:21,950
There were people moving to Florida in 
droves.

2678
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:24,000
Just whose pain?
Doctors in droves.

2679
02:18:24,090 --> 02:18:25,670
I didn't know about this shit.
Yeah.

2680
02:18:26,390 --> 02:18:31,390
Well,
there's a great documentary that we've 

2681
02:18:31,390 --> 02:18:33,401
talked about many times called the 
oxycontin express and they sort of 

2682
02:18:33,401 --> 02:18:38,320
documented that whole route from Ohio 
and Kentucky and all the way down 

2683
02:18:39,201 --> 02:18:44,201
through georgIa.
All the people that would go into 

2684
02:18:44,201 --> 02:18:46,001
Florida just to get pain pills,
all you had to do is just get into 

2685
02:18:46,001 --> 02:18:48,800
Florida and you'd get a doctor and say 
you hurt your back and they would have a

2686
02:18:48,801 --> 02:18:52,400
pharmacy right next to the doctor's 
office and all the pharmacy had his pain

2687
02:18:52,401 --> 02:18:54,050
pills.
So you go there,

2688
02:18:54,350 --> 02:18:55,350
you tell the doctor,
you're heard.

2689
02:18:55,460 --> 02:19:00,460
The doctors is great here.
Here's some fucking serious hardcore 

2690
02:19:00,460 --> 02:19:01,530
drugs that can kill you.
Don't take more of these die.

2691
02:19:01,730 --> 02:19:06,730
They're super powerful opiates.
But since I wrote the wrote it on this 

2692
02:19:06,730 --> 02:19:06,730
piece of paper,
you can go buy it.

2693
02:19:06,730 --> 02:19:11,680
So you go next door and you're buying,
you're buying the hardest of the 

2694
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:13,760
hardcore.
You're buying hillbilly heroin,

2695
02:19:14,420 --> 02:19:16,790
you're buying oxycontin and you're going
deep.

2696
02:19:17,090 --> 02:19:18,260
Now.
I've never done that shit.

2697
02:19:18,261 --> 02:19:20,330
I did morphine when I got my knee 
operated on.

2698
02:19:20,331 --> 02:19:25,331
They gave me that little pump thing and 
you could press it and press it and 

2699
02:19:25,331 --> 02:19:25,331
present and you want to get more 
morphine.

2700
02:19:25,331 --> 02:19:27,550
I don't,
I have no idea what oxycotton like,

2701
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:28,250
but that morphine

2702
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:33,250
felt wonderful.
It feels like the cognitive not feel 

2703
02:19:33,250 --> 02:19:33,250
good.
What does it feel like?

2704
02:19:33,250 --> 02:19:35,510
I one time and that was good enough for 
me.

2705
02:19:36,130 --> 02:19:39,650
Some people must like it.
Everybody likes different shit.

2706
02:19:39,710 --> 02:19:41,910
You know?
I like blow black,

2707
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:43,480
like met.
What did,

2708
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:47,570
what did oxy do for you?
Like why is it not good?

2709
02:19:47,630 --> 02:19:52,630
I took a little tiny piece,
like I'm always a fan of something that 

2710
02:19:52,630 --> 02:19:56,591
might put me to sleep.
View like this caN put you to sleep.

2711
02:19:56,690 --> 02:19:58,370
You know what?
I'll give it a fucking shot.

2712
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:02,210
I like sleep.
You try to go to sleep on oxycontin?

2713
02:20:02,250 --> 02:20:03,050
Yeah,
I didn't know.

2714
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:03,740
I go,
what?

2715
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:06,740
He goes,
you might pass out or he gave me a 16th.

2716
02:20:06,770 --> 02:20:08,450
It was,
there was nothing,

2717
02:20:08,451 --> 02:20:13,451
there was nothing that I popped it and I
just felt like my blood pressure 

2718
02:20:13,761 --> 02:20:15,500
dropped.
Like I couldn't even do anything.

2719
02:20:15,501 --> 02:20:18,500
So I went to sleep and I just know never
to take that shit again.

2720
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:23,920
There's certain shit I've taken that I 
just knew that I was never gonna that 

2721
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:25,570
just wasn't going to work for me.
Damn,

2722
02:20:26,270 --> 02:20:31,270
you know,
heroin has done effect too for a little 

2723
02:20:31,270 --> 02:20:31,270
while.
I,

2724
02:20:31,270 --> 02:20:33,240
it takes you somewhere and if you don't 
put the brakes on it and shit,

2725
02:20:33,241 --> 02:20:37,250
then your gun on that thing.
I don't even know how to describe It,

2726
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:39,330
but I don't mind that feeling,
you know,

2727
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:43,960
the cocaine feeling you'd like in the 
beginning then we're go,

2728
02:20:44,030 --> 02:20:46,670
you don't like it and it gets worse and 
worse and worse,

2729
02:20:46,671 --> 02:20:48,260
but by that time you were addicted to 
it.

2730
02:20:48,350 --> 02:20:49,610
You know what I'm saying?
Matt?

2731
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:53,420
I never understood that shit.
Wanting to be up for four days that that

2732
02:20:53,421 --> 02:20:58,421
just seems.
And you will be up for two fucking days 

2733
02:20:58,421 --> 02:21:02,110
thinking you tie it,
but let me go lay down and I can't 

2734
02:21:02,110 --> 02:21:02,750
sleep.
I'm sweating on dose to sweat.

2735
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:08,240
So pills I've always had.
I like a little fucking sleeping pill or

2736
02:21:08,241 --> 02:21:13,241
something,
but they can't because of this sleep 

2737
02:21:13,241 --> 02:21:13,241
apnea.
Yeah,

2738
02:21:13,241 --> 02:21:13,241
they're too dangerous.
Right.

2739
02:21:14,210 --> 02:21:16,790
I can take the anxiety medication.
That'll help me.

2740
02:21:16,791 --> 02:21:20,780
Sometimes I'll pop a few.
We're just stuck there like as a plan.

2741
02:21:20,781 --> 02:21:23,270
But like one point five told them to 
nothing.

2742
02:21:23,271 --> 02:21:25,580
To nobody.
Point five.

2743
02:21:25,790 --> 02:21:30,550
Do find that we'd let you go to sleep at
night.

2744
02:21:30,750 --> 02:21:35,750
Don't do deck.
You ever seen me at night smoking weed 

2745
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:37,130
because the initial effect was in the 
daytime.

2746
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:39,450
I like that morning.
Hi.

2747
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:44,840
Why do you like that?
Because that's the one that gets the 

2748
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:47,060
whole.
That's the one that lets me email text.

2749
02:21:47,061 --> 02:21:52,061
We didn't think that the all by 9:00
or by 9:00,

2750
02:21:54,140 --> 02:21:57,500
get It either way.
Call six,

2751
02:21:57,890 --> 02:22:01,510
put the coffee on the computer,
feed the cat,

2752
02:22:02,660 --> 02:22:07,660
pablo it,
she the pablo escobar pablo.

2753
02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:13,700
Open your eyes and bed.
Roll over and take a joint and smoke it.

2754
02:22:14,060 --> 02:22:19,060
That's no brainer.
You got to let your body wake up that 

2755
02:22:19,060 --> 02:22:20,510
low.
Whether that's the quickest way was that

2756
02:22:20,511 --> 02:22:21,510
fucking thing.
Yeah.

2757
02:22:21,570 --> 02:22:24,270
Let me take a hit.
I love that little blunt.

2758
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:29,280
That fucking gino from speed.
we'd the some of the best fucking jamie 

2759
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:29,710
picked this one up.
This is.

2760
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:34,590
This is a place down the street.
what's it called?

2761
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:38,170
The blunt or something?
I don't know.

2762
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:43,340
Hollywood's dedicated.
Blind.

2763
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:48,600
Yeah.
Waken up and pulling the pablo people 

2764
02:22:48,750 --> 02:22:49,850
dedicated.
Yeah,

2765
02:22:49,870 --> 02:22:52,260
it's medicine man.
okay,

2766
02:22:52,590 --> 02:22:56,040
but you wake up and give your body some 
chance to like.

2767
02:22:56,041 --> 02:22:57,900
I remember smoking cigarettes in the 
morning.

2768
02:22:58,170 --> 02:23:03,170
You don'T know what,
what damage is to your body until you 

2769
02:23:04,981 --> 02:23:07,590
wake up in the morning.
Take six steps,

2770
02:23:08,370 --> 02:23:10,650
sit down and pull the cigarette out and 
whited.

2771
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:12,570
There is no worse damage.

2772
02:23:13,670 --> 02:23:15,300
A human being could do that.
Body.

2773
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:20,720
Forget heroin.
Forget eaten a few avocados for getting 

2774
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:20,720
a burger.
king.

2775
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:24,000
Whopper.
Get up at six in the morning.

2776
02:23:24,420 --> 02:23:29,420
Give yourself three minutes and by the 
cigarette you body does not recovered 

2777
02:23:29,420 --> 02:23:31,340
from that and you don't know how bad it 
is to you.

2778
02:23:31,341 --> 02:23:35,040
Stop doing it.
That damage.

2779
02:23:35,820 --> 02:23:39,720
So I look at it the same day we reef,
I let my body wake up a little bit,

2780
02:23:39,830 --> 02:23:44,830
but at a drink water.
Let the bodies heat could drink a glass 

2781
02:23:44,830 --> 02:23:47,670
of water with ice.
Let my body wake up,

2782
02:23:47,671 --> 02:23:52,671
get the stomach going,
drink a little coffee and then bang out 

2783
02:23:52,671 --> 02:23:55,260
some referral.
It's a different day.

2784
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:57,120
And you'd like to work out in the 
morning to write.

2785
02:23:57,720 --> 02:24:00,510
I'm 55.
I can't come to your house at 8:00

2786
02:24:00,511 --> 02:24:01,680
at night,
but I can't.

2787
02:24:01,890 --> 02:24:03,780
I'm not going to roll with you.
Is six in the morning either.

2788
02:24:04,140 --> 02:24:05,900
Most attacks happened before.
One time.

2789
02:24:06,060 --> 02:24:06,800
Do that?
Yeah.

2790
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:07,920
How come?
I don't know.

2791
02:24:07,950 --> 02:24:09,600
I didn't write the book and check it 
out.

2792
02:24:09,670 --> 02:24:12,120
MosT heart attacks happened before 
fucking 12:00.

2793
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:18,080
So you don't want to be.
I know you don't want enjoy in your 

2794
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:18,990
site.
Control at six in the morning either.

2795
02:24:19,740 --> 02:24:23,280
I'm good at nine to kickbox tend to 
kickbox 11,

2796
02:24:23,290 --> 02:24:24,860
12.
The jujitsu eyes.

2797
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:27,990
You got to wake everything up.
That's the whole deal.

2798
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:30,210
Heart attacks are more common in the 
morning.

2799
02:24:30,211 --> 02:24:35,211
Says fox news five to six times more 
likely to occur in the morning hours 

2800
02:24:35,761 --> 02:24:37,740
between one and 5:00
AM,

2801
02:24:37,741 --> 02:24:41,190
and studies have shown that morning 
heart attacks tend to be more severe and

2802
02:24:41,191 --> 02:24:46,191
those that happened later in the day too
long or too short of an interval can 

2803
02:24:46,191 --> 02:24:48,090
result in abnormal heart rhythms called 
arrhythmias.

2804
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:50,640
As a matter of fact,
I had stuff giving mother stabbed in the

2805
02:24:50,641 --> 02:24:55,641
mornings.
You're worried about heart attacks 

2806
02:24:55,641 --> 02:24:57,030
because that was my more.
I love pushing in the wake them up.

2807
02:24:57,190 --> 02:24:57,420
Whoa.

2808
02:25:00,180 --> 02:25:02,020
When you kick mama with that leg in the 
moRning,

2809
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:07,040
you know what I'm saying?
You can be a little wife a tap in the 

2810
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:07,040
morning.
She pops her head up and then they,

2811
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:08,280
they already know they get up,
they pee,

2812
02:25:08,281 --> 02:25:11,010
they drIve the monkey good.
They come back,

2813
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:15,400
they could you eat that fucking monkey 
and then you start giving them a stab.

2814
02:25:15,401 --> 02:25:18,030
Him like a soldier and that stabbing 
dog.

2815
02:25:18,031 --> 02:25:19,950
I wouldn't have to get up and start 
breathing heavy.

2816
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:25,880
And then I thought about that.
That fucking gangster tells me to 

2817
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:27,730
testify that time in court and he bent 
over to tie his shoes and he had a heart

2818
02:25:27,731 --> 02:25:32,731
attack and the guy ended up doing a 
fucking jail and we had to talk about 

2819
02:25:32,731 --> 02:25:34,630
that in a second,
but we will cover the heart attack.

2820
02:25:35,020 --> 02:25:40,020
I take a baby aspirin before I go.
I drink something from gnc to get me 

2821
02:25:40,020 --> 02:25:41,470
going a little bit in the mornings.

2822
02:25:41,470 --> 02:25:44,110
I still take my protein powder I live 
by,

2823
02:25:44,860 --> 02:25:49,860
but I do take us up before I go to the 
gym and I do drink something while I'm 

2824
02:25:49,860 --> 02:25:50,860
at the gym to calm me down a little bit.
What do you drink?

2825
02:25:51,310 --> 02:25:53,590
something from gnc.
Gnc.

2826
02:25:54,280 --> 02:25:56,030
I don't know.
Hm?

2827
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:57,810
No names,
no names.

2828
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:03,370
performance levels.
I always pop a shroom tech again,

2829
02:26:03,371 --> 02:26:08,371
I don't pop to showroom texts.
I pop one and I started with a half a 

2830
02:26:08,371 --> 02:26:11,941
capsule because it was finally my heart 
was beaten too much to take a year.

2831
02:26:12,450 --> 02:26:14,260
You got to watch the ticket.
That's interesting.

2832
02:26:14,660 --> 02:26:15,460
You know,
listen,

2833
02:26:15,540 --> 02:26:17,740
god gives you a certain amount of text 
to your heart.

2834
02:26:19,150 --> 02:26:21,820
I did cook that.
That fucked up the whole clock.

2835
02:26:22,670 --> 02:26:25,370
That fucked up the speedometer.
You get sand in your dials.

2836
02:26:26,230 --> 02:26:31,230
The dials I got fucked up the dominance 
and I got to strengthened a little bit 

2837
02:26:31,230 --> 02:26:34,720
in that strengthens it,
but there's a lot of shit you could do 

2838
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:35,590
without thinking like a marathon or 
something.

2839
02:26:36,310 --> 02:26:39,010
I watch my fingers numbness.
I go,

2840
02:26:39,460 --> 02:26:43,720
I get a finger up my ass as much as I 
could from the doctor I use.

2841
02:26:43,800 --> 02:26:48,800
I overuse insurance dollars.
Like I'm going friday for a blood test 

2842
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:52,240
wide join because I'm in the mood.
You gotta switch up every couple months.

2843
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:58,260
You know what I'm saying?
You gotta switcH it up like Keith 

2844
02:26:58,260 --> 02:27:00,360
Richards.
He's still alive because he switched it 

2845
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:00,360
that women don't die of heart attacks.
why?

2846
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:01,560
Because they believe every month will.
He only answers that.

2847
02:27:01,570 --> 02:27:06,570
don't take the fucking word.
I'm just relaxed.

2848
02:27:08,530 --> 02:27:10,720
You don't want to be enjoying your 
conversation.

2849
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:13,600
You're just smoking so much weed.
You getting paranoid?

2850
02:27:13,810 --> 02:27:18,810
No.
I love take it down and getting deeper 

2851
02:27:20,831 --> 02:27:23,590
and deeper into the whole like what's 
the matter?

2852
02:27:23,750 --> 02:27:28,590
Nothing doesn't matter at all.
It's great to see you.

2853
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:34,400
what's going on with normal shit now I'm
coming tonight.

2854
02:27:36,950 --> 02:27:37,930
You go down there tonight.

2855
02:27:38,560 --> 02:27:43,560
Tonight.
I've been taking a few days off after 

2856
02:27:43,560 --> 02:27:43,560
the netflix.
Yeah.

2857
02:27:43,560 --> 02:27:48,500
Nice.
I want them to fall in love again with 

2858
02:27:48,500 --> 02:27:50,050
it.
I want it to a good to take time off.

2859
02:27:50,380 --> 02:27:54,970
It's really weird how you live and you 
learn and you still for dumb shit.

2860
02:27:55,750 --> 02:27:58,750
You know the only person I should listen
to him when it comes to comedy is you.

2861
02:27:59,130 --> 02:28:01,800
And I don't see you enough that I don't 
talk to you enough about that.

2862
02:28:01,801 --> 02:28:06,801
I got to get more planes with you 
because when I tried I watched the john 

2863
02:28:06,801 --> 02:28:09,100
and special fell in love with his joke 
writing and stuff.

2864
02:28:09,180 --> 02:28:11,200
It's very funny guy.
Really nice guy.

2865
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:13,360
Really nice guy.
That's fucking great.

2866
02:28:13,361 --> 02:28:14,710
Fucking special,
you know?

2867
02:28:15,700 --> 02:28:18,010
But every once in a wHile.
I'm sorry I'm saying this word.

2868
02:28:18,011 --> 02:28:20,530
I always think I get the white moment 
and I'm not a white.

2869
02:28:21,740 --> 02:28:22,190
The reason

2870
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:23,910
why you liked me and the people like ms 
dot [inaudible].

2871
02:28:23,911 --> 02:28:26,990
You doN't know what's going to come out 
of my mouth when I become a writer.

2872
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:29,120
That's what I'm not a comedian,
normal.

2873
02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:32,680
When I go home and start writing stupid 
fucking jokes and you laugh at them.

2874
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:34,640
I'm not joe.
He is no more.

2875
02:28:35,690 --> 02:28:40,190
That's not what joey diaz as opposed to 
do you know what I'm supposed to do.

2876
02:28:40,670 --> 02:28:43,340
But this shit that's happened now scares
the shit out of me.

2877
02:28:44,030 --> 02:28:46,670
So now I gotta go up there.
You pay 25 bucks to see me.

2878
02:28:46,671 --> 02:28:48,950
I ain't got a luck thing and leaving my 
soul up there.

2879
02:28:49,730 --> 02:28:54,730
I take that shit seriously now,
but I'm starting to take a little bit 

2880
02:28:54,730 --> 02:28:54,730
too seriously.
ThIs shit you see now in what way?

2881
02:28:56,280 --> 02:28:59,990
That the people coming to the shows,
people coming to the shows to see you.

2882
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:03,020
They need and they want to do you to see
you do well.

2883
02:29:03,620 --> 02:29:08,620
So I go up there with this plan material
that I work on heart that I believe in 

2884
02:29:08,630 --> 02:29:12,530
that bullshit because I'm a lot 
friendlier when I go up there and I just

2885
02:29:12,550 --> 02:29:16,370
fucking yell and scream and go off the 
cuff and go crazy and my eyeballs jarden

2886
02:29:16,371 --> 02:29:18,080
red.
But no,

2887
02:29:18,081 --> 02:29:23,081
I want to be john waYne because he makes
me fucking laugh and he's what in your 

2888
02:29:23,081 --> 02:29:25,700
mind that you comic is everybody's got 
their own way of doing it?

2889
02:29:25,910 --> 02:29:27,110
No,
and that's what I realize.

2890
02:29:27,111 --> 02:29:28,940
I'm going back to being a fucking 
lunatic.

2891
02:29:28,970 --> 02:29:32,630
I'm going back to midnight spots next 
week.

2892
02:29:32,631 --> 02:29:35,750
I'm going back to midnight spots going 
back to kylie,

2893
02:29:36,140 --> 02:29:37,220
kylie,
kylie,

2894
02:29:37,610 --> 02:29:41,120
going back to cali,
going back to those spots.

2895
02:29:41,121 --> 02:29:43,930
I know they're late,
but they're the only ones that keep you.

2896
02:29:43,931 --> 02:29:46,640
If you're going to play it,
if you listen for me to be in uniform,

2897
02:29:46,641 --> 02:29:47,630
that's the only way I could do it.

2898
02:29:48,320 --> 02:29:49,940
That 10:15
following you.

2899
02:29:49,941 --> 02:29:53,420
That ain't fun no more.
We gotta be back there late like we used

2900
02:29:53,421 --> 02:29:58,421
to go on four hours of sleep for two or 
three weeks and then you gotta walk me 

2901
02:29:58,421 --> 02:30:00,830
over and buy me a fucking pink that 
sandwich like in the old days.

2902
02:30:00,860 --> 02:30:02,630
Why don't you like the 10,
15 spots?

2903
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:08,030
because they put me in that position.
I'm sick of fucking been in that fucking

2904
02:30:08,031 --> 02:30:10,070
john malaney position.
I'm not john malaney.

2905
02:30:10,090 --> 02:30:10,640
I'm going,
what do you mean?

2906
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:16,440
But I like your dad to see me because 
something's going to come out of my 

2907
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:16,730
mouth.
That's going to be funny,

2908
02:30:17,330 --> 02:30:19,370
funny coming out of my fucking mouth and
listen,

2909
02:30:19,460 --> 02:30:21,500
I love you,
but you're.

2910
02:30:21,700 --> 02:30:23,690
That's crazy.
Talk you.

2911
02:30:23,691 --> 02:30:27,680
What you do is your way of doing it.
It's great at 10.

2912
02:30:27,740 --> 02:30:28,690
It's great.
At eight.

2913
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:33,700
You could do it.
Three in the afternoon show would be 

2914
02:30:33,700 --> 02:30:33,700
amazing.

2915
02:30:33,700 --> 02:30:35,380
They stare at me at the original room.
I'm going back to midnight.

2916
02:30:35,790 --> 02:30:40,790
I'm taking the kennison spots again 
three nights a week because that can 

2917
02:30:40,790 --> 02:30:44,270
handle it.
That means I get home at 1:32.

2918
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:45,990
You're going to do the late spots.
Yeah.

2919
02:30:45,991 --> 02:30:50,991
You know what I mean?
The reason why I do this early shit is 

2920
02:30:50,991 --> 02:30:51,200
because I'm trying to be normal.
I read that book,

2921
02:30:51,350 --> 02:30:52,650
your podcast.
Like I said,

2922
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:54,170
okay,
now I like this.

2923
02:30:54,171 --> 02:30:59,171
Hold on a second.
So you're going to close out the store 

2924
02:30:59,171 --> 02:30:59,240
and do like an hour long set.
No,

2925
02:30:59,241 --> 02:31:00,290
no.
15,

2926
02:31:00,291 --> 02:31:02,500
12 slash 12 slash 15.
Oh god.

2927
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:04,640
So you're not going to do like the don 
burris situation.

2928
02:31:05,220 --> 02:31:09,190
That's what listening to joey,
at least for the moment.

2929
02:31:11,190 --> 02:31:16,190
I've just saying you got,
but you can if you're closing out the 

2930
02:31:16,190 --> 02:31:16,190
show,
right?

2931
02:31:16,190 --> 02:31:17,420
You could go along.
I don't want to close out the show.

2932
02:31:17,420 --> 02:31:18,420
One of the more.
I don't want to be out.

2933
02:31:18,421 --> 02:31:21,330
I'm scared of go out at night.
So it's not a thought.

2934
02:31:21,331 --> 02:31:22,800
You were saying you want to do the 
kinison spot?

2935
02:31:23,560 --> 02:31:28,560
Midnight.
Midnight spot when he would do that 

2936
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:28,560
spot.
Oh,

2937
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:29,640
I thought he was always the last guy.
I thought it was the.

2938
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:31,170
I mean that's what they always say about
brody,

2939
02:31:31,171 --> 02:31:34,210
but he does the kinison spot and I 
thought it was the midnight run.

2940
02:31:34,700 --> 02:31:36,570
Let's call it the poem on the spot.
Okay.

2941
02:31:36,930 --> 02:31:39,390
Well just you want to do a late night 
spot?

2942
02:31:40,100 --> 02:31:42,610
I think they do a lot better.
I don't have to go to.

2943
02:31:42,940 --> 02:31:45,000
This will be out for sure.
Yeah.

2944
02:31:45,090 --> 02:31:47,010
Yeah.
You ready for me to.

2945
02:31:47,011 --> 02:31:49,170
It's time for me to be.
I'm a fucking degenerate.

2946
02:31:49,171 --> 02:31:51,290
I should say that fellow degenerates.
Yeah.

2947
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:54,400
I'm to block in the morning.
Nobody's saying one.

2948
02:31:54,420 --> 02:31:55,110
Do I say one?

2949
02:31:55,110 --> 02:31:57,870
I said 12.
One in the morning.

2950
02:31:57,900 --> 02:31:59,280
12,
12:00.

2951
02:31:59,281 --> 02:32:00,630
You know you're getting up at one 
though.

2952
02:32:00,820 --> 02:32:02,270
12 slash realistic?
No.

2953
02:32:02,390 --> 02:32:03,090
12,
10.

2954
02:32:03,750 --> 02:32:05,600
You might get disturbed professionals at
the store.

2955
02:32:05,601 --> 02:32:07,230
They're pretty professional,
professional.

2956
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:09,390
There's no more fucking people coming in
and bumping you.

2957
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:11,160
Well,
that still happens a little bit,

2958
02:32:11,161 --> 02:32:13,250
but not too much.
They don't.

2959
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:18,320
They don't.
No one jumps on and does an hour and a 

2960
02:32:18,320 --> 02:32:18,320
half like the old days.
I miss.

2961
02:32:18,320 --> 02:32:20,060
I missed that 12:00
thought of mind.

2962
02:32:20,870 --> 02:32:23,730
The top tWelve for me in the old days 
was.

2963
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:27,150
I swear to god joe.
They've already heard everything.

2964
02:32:27,610 --> 02:32:29,050
Yeah.
If they.

2965
02:32:29,070 --> 02:32:33,450
If I think they really want to hear 
these three jokes,

2966
02:32:33,540 --> 02:32:38,540
but pocket.
I got think of it and it taught me how 

2967
02:32:38,540 --> 02:32:41,180
to write really good.
What do you.

2968
02:32:41,220 --> 02:32:46,220
What has changed recently?
Like the one of the things a lot of 

2969
02:32:46,220 --> 02:32:47,490
people have been saying with a 
especially the me too,

2970
02:32:47,491 --> 02:32:52,491
movement,
that people are more cautious about st 

2971
02:32:52,491 --> 02:32:55,440
controversial jokes now.
do you feel that you feel like energy in

2972
02:32:55,441 --> 02:32:59,350
the air being different?
Do you feel like,

2973
02:33:00,610 --> 02:33:03,730
I know you won't get mad at me.
I feel the eneRgy is different,

2974
02:33:03,731 --> 02:33:06,190
but guess what jay,
but it don't apply to me.

2975
02:33:08,700 --> 02:33:11,550
It don't apply to me,
doesn't apply to me,

2976
02:33:11,551 --> 02:33:14,790
and it's never going to apply to me.
Okay.

2977
02:33:14,880 --> 02:33:17,550
I understand me shooting your special on
your network.

2978
02:33:17,551 --> 02:33:21,840
You don't want me to use certain words.
This parts and I get that.

2979
02:33:21,870 --> 02:33:26,870
This is a business.
This is business as I got mouths to 

2980
02:33:26,870 --> 02:33:27,780
feed,
but when I'm at the comedy store,

2981
02:33:27,990 --> 02:33:30,210
when I'm at the improv,
when I'm at the laugh factory,

2982
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:32,780
when I'm in flappers,
when I'm at the ha,

2983
02:33:33,450 --> 02:33:36,780
when I'm at the New York gotham,
you got to let it fly.

2984
02:33:37,310 --> 02:33:38,220
I'm old.
Let it fly,

2985
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:39,510
let it fly.
Okay.

2986
02:33:39,511 --> 02:33:40,510
And I'm sorry.
No,

2987
02:33:41,100 --> 02:33:42,260
no,
no.

2988
02:33:42,270 --> 02:33:42,870
He.
Sorry.

2989
02:33:43,350 --> 02:33:45,210
Just so you know,
you know what I put on yesterday.

2990
02:33:45,360 --> 02:33:50,360
Would you put on.
That's what I put on the studio 

2991
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:51,210
yesterday and this is it.
This is it because it's time.

2992
02:33:51,540 --> 02:33:54,720
We're not taking it no more.
I'm not taking it no more.

2993
02:33:55,080 --> 02:33:56,340
I put on an album,
but again,

2994
02:33:56,341 --> 02:33:59,250
I'm very sorry if I offend somebody.
I didn't name it.

2995
02:33:59,730 --> 02:34:02,130
He did.
So take your fucking problem up with.

2996
02:34:02,250 --> 02:34:06,540
The name of the album is bicentennial 
nigga by James Richard.

2997
02:34:06,541 --> 02:34:07,770
Richard pryor.
I put it on,

2998
02:34:07,980 --> 02:34:10,770
I listened to it twice and I did it.
had a ball and cried.

2999
02:34:11,100 --> 02:34:13,860
I got fucking.
I've got the,

3000
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:18,400
the periscope listening to richard.
Okay.

3001
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:19,810
I got it.
Yeah.

3002
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:24,840
Okay.
And I've liStened to lenny bruce live 

3003
02:34:24,840 --> 02:34:25,540
from carnegie hall in the last couple of
weeks.

3004
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:31,200
I don't know when the last time you 
listened to that because we can't 

3005
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:31,200
because of our,
uh,

3006
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:33,520
we guys like you and I can't.
Definitely not jamie.

3007
02:34:33,521 --> 02:34:38,270
And definitely if you're under 30 you 
can't because of the cost.

3008
02:34:38,700 --> 02:34:41,800
This is how slow cultural references and
how slow it is,

3009
02:34:42,250 --> 02:34:46,340
but It's a lesson I listened to that and
I'm going home gets wrong.

3010
02:34:46,350 --> 02:34:48,400
Listen to tonight what I'm staying in 
tonight.

3011
02:34:48,440 --> 02:34:52,000
Listen to the one when he meets the wine
on to dRacula.

3012
02:34:52,220 --> 02:34:53,280
Oh,
I think you'd see the.

3013
02:34:53,420 --> 02:34:55,750
Is it something I said or the niggas 
crazy.

3014
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:58,780
Both of those albums.
A masterpieces.

3015
02:34:59,290 --> 02:35:03,910
and that's how he wanted us to do it.
That was how we have to do it.

3016
02:35:04,450 --> 02:35:07,720
He didn't give a fuck what the fuck was 
said.

3017
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:13,320
If a company wants to pay you hbo or cbs
and joey,

3018
02:35:13,651 --> 02:35:16,510
can we talk to him in the corner?
We can't have that jump because we got a

3019
02:35:16,511 --> 02:35:18,940
complaint about that.
I'm an adult.

3020
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:20,770
I can't sell.
You know,

3021
02:35:20,820 --> 02:35:22,500
listened to bill hicks is dead.
No,

3022
02:35:22,520 --> 02:35:24,420
I don't feel too good myself.
Okay.

3023
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:26,710
All right.
Let's cut the fucking shit.

3024
02:35:26,770 --> 02:35:29,050
Okay.
we do this for profit.

3025
02:35:29,080 --> 02:35:31,510
at the end of the fucking day.
We're feeding our families.

3026
02:35:32,180 --> 02:35:32,890
Right?
So.

3027
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:34,660
But there's also a way you do it.

3028
02:35:34,780 --> 02:35:37,810
And there's also the way you do it for 
profit.

3029
02:35:37,830 --> 02:35:42,830
you know,
when I watched the richard pryor thing 

3030
02:35:42,830 --> 02:35:44,611
and I know he went into a hollywood bowl
and they were doing the thing for gays 

3031
02:35:44,611 --> 02:35:44,611
and he went up there and win against the
gays.

3032
02:35:44,611 --> 02:35:46,660
I got it.
It's something I would do.

3033
02:35:46,661 --> 02:35:48,670
I don't know.
I don't know,

3034
02:35:49,660 --> 02:35:52,690
but it's who was supposed to be in a way
as a comedian.

3035
02:35:54,220 --> 02:35:59,220
What's supposed to be the social column 
of society in a way,

3036
02:36:01,270 --> 02:36:06,270
in some way.
So now you want to take that away from 

3037
02:36:06,270 --> 02:36:06,270
me.
You want to take the way.

3038
02:36:06,270 --> 02:36:08,500
I can't say I grew up on the word 
retarded.

3039
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:12,610
I grew up on the word faggot.
I grew up on the word.

3040
02:36:12,611 --> 02:36:17,611
I grew up on a lot of words that people 
don't accept today and I'm very sorry 

3041
02:36:17,800 --> 02:36:22,800
that you don't accept them,
but it's too late for me to change my 

3042
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:22,900
game right now.

3043
02:36:23,590 --> 02:36:25,240
Yeah,
I'll try my hardest.

3044
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:27,370
I try my hardest.
I'm still gonna.

3045
02:36:27,371 --> 02:36:29,980
Say tranny from time to time.
I know it offends,

3046
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:33,790
but when you're a comic.
Listen man,

3047
02:36:33,791 --> 02:36:38,791
the first seven minutes of any news is 
about what's going on in the world in 

3048
02:36:39,210 --> 02:36:42,040
the next 10 minutes is bad.
I never talked about politics.

3049
02:36:42,300 --> 02:36:43,630
To top it off.
I'm a felon,

3050
02:36:44,110 --> 02:36:46,170
so I need to talk about pounds.
You know what I'm saying?

3051
02:36:46,180 --> 02:36:46,560
Like,
well,

3052
02:36:46,770 --> 02:36:48,190
there's just things I'm not going to 
talk about.

3053
02:36:48,191 --> 02:36:52,990
Kicking an abortion child.
Remember for a long time every comic was

3054
02:36:53,700 --> 02:36:56,650
kicking a born at freedom.
That's not my style.

3055
02:36:56,890 --> 02:36:58,880
I'm up there to talk about,
you know,

3056
02:36:59,000 --> 02:36:59,960
for the board of.
Yeah,

3057
02:37:00,030 --> 02:37:05,030
you go to comedy shows and there's 
always trying to be shocked at wants to 

3058
02:37:05,030 --> 02:37:06,350
be shocking.
I'm not going to be shocked.

3059
02:37:06,380 --> 02:37:09,010
I'm 15 and I'm here to tell you hoW I 
see it.

3060
02:37:09,011 --> 02:37:11,750
You want to see it.
This is how I see it.

3061
02:37:12,040 --> 02:37:16,130
If I offend you,
I didn't offend you to before.

3062
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:21,130
In the beginning of the shoW,
I said something very offensive until 

3063
02:37:21,130 --> 02:37:21,860
term,
but in my reality was really,

3064
02:37:21,861 --> 02:37:26,861
you won't fire crackers.
You buy it from a chinese dude now then 

3065
02:37:26,861 --> 02:37:26,861
charlie,
why is that racist?

3066
02:37:26,861 --> 02:37:28,550
Because that's racist,
but as a society,

3067
02:37:29,020 --> 02:37:32,080
how is it racist,
factual chinese people out of fireworks?

3068
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:36,140
Weird.
There's weird ones that we all let fly.

3069
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:38,990
Like black dudes with big dicks.
No one's complaining about that.

3070
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:44,140
Right?
Do you ever hear that you assume black 

3071
02:37:44,140 --> 02:37:44,140
dude as a big deck because anybody 
combined?

3072
02:37:44,140 --> 02:37:48,550
Probably They're looking to.
Now that might be like maybe I'm the 

3073
02:37:48,550 --> 02:37:48,550
first one to get called out on it.
That's racist.

3074
02:37:48,550 --> 02:37:50,000
To think that black dudes have big 
decks.

3075
02:37:51,890 --> 02:37:56,300
Is it is if it's positive,
is it pot is like a positive attribute.

3076
02:37:56,301 --> 02:37:59,450
Racist.
Like if you said asian people are better

3077
02:37:59,451 --> 02:38:00,950
at math,
people would say that's racist.

3078
02:38:01,490 --> 02:38:02,660
How is it racist?

3079
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:07,660
If they're really good at something,
like if they have more talent or skill 

3080
02:38:07,761 --> 02:38:12,170
or more accomplishments hasn't racist 
but isn't that racial if it's good,

3081
02:38:13,430 --> 02:38:14,810
right.
Like jews accepted.

3082
02:38:14,990 --> 02:38:19,990
If you tell ari that more european jews,
one nobel science prizes,

3083
02:38:20,510 --> 02:38:21,770
he's like,
of course we're smarter.

3084
02:38:22,790 --> 02:38:25,610
Is it,
is it racist to talk about how many jEws

3085
02:38:25,611 --> 02:38:27,380
are so fucking smart?
Like why is that?

3086
02:38:27,381 --> 02:38:32,381
Why they say god damn smart.
even think about how many german and 

3087
02:38:32,381 --> 02:38:34,970
european jews were like fucking serious 
geniuses.

3088
02:38:35,150 --> 02:38:37,940
It's crazy trend.
Like what happened over there.

3089
02:38:37,941 --> 02:38:39,650
Callum waS trying to explain it to me 
once,

3090
02:38:39,980 --> 02:38:44,980
but their values and their education and
the experiences and what led to just 

3091
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:49,670
google the numbers of european jews that
have won nobel science prizes.

3092
02:38:49,671 --> 02:38:53,760
It's kinda like it's eyeopening.
You know how many Guinea from New Jersey

3093
02:38:53,761 --> 02:38:58,761
and zero.
Zero guineas from New Jersey when 

3094
02:38:58,761 --> 02:38:58,761
insights.
Right.

3095
02:38:58,761 --> 02:39:02,891
None of my relatives went in science 
projects in this up a couple of weeks 

3096
02:39:02,891 --> 02:39:02,891
ago.
It was hard to look at.

3097
02:39:02,891 --> 02:39:02,891
Oh,
is it?

3098
02:39:02,891 --> 02:39:06,380
Yeah.
What did european jews that have won the

3099
02:39:06,381 --> 02:39:09,020
nobel science prize?
Try that.

3100
02:39:09,290 --> 02:39:11,900
I don't know.
I don't even know what these numbers.

3101
02:39:11,940 --> 02:39:14,000
I'm talking about my ass.
I know that it's.

3102
02:39:14,030 --> 02:39:18,020
I've definitely heard it discussed that 
there was a giant number.

3103
02:39:19,010 --> 02:39:19,810
What are you doing over there,
joe?

3104
02:39:19,910 --> 02:39:24,910
He doesn't text me and let me know what 
body I need to be at.

3105
02:39:25,490 --> 02:39:27,170
Oh,
4th of July baby.

3106
02:39:27,171 --> 02:39:31,760
This is our.
Our country's birthday is a time that we

3107
02:39:31,761 --> 02:39:36,761
should cherish.
I think we should play the national 

3108
02:39:36,761 --> 02:39:37,550
anthem mayBe later.
We got it.

3109
02:39:37,570 --> 02:39:37,840
Okay.

3110
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:41,690
But you got to play the national anthem 
real quick.

3111
02:39:41,710 --> 02:39:43,730
They have on this morning by my house.
I loved it.

3112
02:39:43,970 --> 02:39:44,780
I fucking love it.

3113
02:39:44,890 --> 02:39:46,930
So how was your experience during your 
netflix special?

3114
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:48,910
Everything was good.

3115
02:39:48,910 --> 02:39:49,820
Great.
Netflix.

3116
02:39:49,821 --> 02:39:51,830
I'd take my hats off to them.
Everything was great.

3117
02:39:51,860 --> 02:39:54,470
It was my fuck up.
It was my fuck up.

3118
02:39:54,471 --> 02:39:59,471
I let it get into my head too much.
I listen to too many people because I 

3119
02:39:59,471 --> 02:40:04,271
forgot the number one thing.
Just be felony that shit.

3120
02:40:04,790 --> 02:40:07,820
Be yourself.
It doesn't matter how many shows did you

3121
02:40:07,821 --> 02:40:10,580
film to?
First of all,

3122
02:40:10,581 --> 02:40:13,140
I think was a disaster.
The second one,

3123
02:40:13,141 --> 02:40:18,141
I redeemed myself a little bit.
We'll put something together and we'll 

3124
02:40:18,141 --> 02:40:19,000
save something.
So now I'm working really hard.

3125
02:40:19,001 --> 02:40:19,730
I'm like,
no,

3126
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:23,580
I'm going back to my old roots.
How I want to do my stand up again.

3127
02:40:24,060 --> 02:40:27,720
It's hard when you only have two shows.
Going to shows.

3128
02:40:27,721 --> 02:40:29,470
Is todd more bullshit?
No more.

3129
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:31,670
No more.
I Listened to.

3130
02:40:31,690 --> 02:40:33,810
This guy has nothing to do with me.
I'm a stand up comic.

3131
02:40:35,320 --> 02:40:39,310
That's what I signed up for.
What do I got left?

3132
02:40:39,550 --> 02:40:41,290
I'm 55,
but I go back to doing.

3133
02:40:41,291 --> 02:40:44,530
Stand up another 10 years maybe.
I got to stop now.

3134
02:40:44,531 --> 02:40:48,070
You're going to shut me down now.
This is where we get started

3135
02:40:50,200 --> 02:40:52,850
is where we get started.
We got to.

3136
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:54,870
We got daughters.
When do you think about.

3137
02:40:54,871 --> 02:40:56,610
Do you think about ever stopping doing 
standup?

3138
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:59,410
Because I do.
Occasionally I think about it and then I

3139
02:40:59,411 --> 02:41:04,411
take a flight back with dice from New 
York and I look at dyson before I 

3140
02:41:04,411 --> 02:41:04,411
approach them.
I sit down,

3141
02:41:04,411 --> 02:41:09,030
I look at them from 10 feet away for 10 
minutes and I think to myself,

3142
02:41:09,031 --> 02:41:10,890
is this what I want to be doing at that 
age?

3143
02:41:11,880 --> 02:41:13,770
And I think about what,
what would we be doing?

3144
02:41:15,270 --> 02:41:20,270
What would you really want to be a run 
your wife and your daughters every 

3145
02:41:20,270 --> 02:41:24,921
fucking weekend for every fucking week.
You're already used to leave in one 

3146
02:41:24,921 --> 02:41:28,491
weekend at least already used to it.
There's going to be a casino.

3147
02:41:29,550 --> 02:41:34,550
SomeboDies going to pAy you once a month
and leave the house with two if you 

3148
02:41:34,550 --> 02:41:35,910
would you be happy with your act if 
you're only going out once a month.

3149
02:41:36,510 --> 02:41:41,510
Like if you weren't going up and 
practice and going out once a month 

3150
02:41:41,510 --> 02:41:44,151
could be awful.
But I'm saying yOu still hosting the 

3151
02:41:44,151 --> 02:41:47,250
pizza place on Wednesday nights and you 
still,

3152
02:41:47,251 --> 02:41:52,140
let's pretend you move to columbus,
Ohio to columbus,

3153
02:41:52,141 --> 02:41:56,490
Ohio was so high io and you work the 
funny bone once a year,

3154
02:41:57,390 --> 02:41:59,880
right?
And you do your little pizza,

3155
02:41:59,881 --> 02:42:03,060
open mic somewhere down the corner a 
couple of nights a week.

3156
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:07,290
They look at you as the older guy.
They all came up looking into comedy,

3157
02:42:07,291 --> 02:42:09,060
Watching it,
you know,

3158
02:42:09,061 --> 02:42:10,080
they listened to you.
You know,

3159
02:42:10,081 --> 02:42:11,520
when I started in economy,
I started,

3160
02:42:11,521 --> 02:42:16,390
the guy's name was george mccalvi and 
george mccalvi was a really special guy,

3161
02:42:16,391 --> 02:42:21,391
joe joe,
because he had been on the tonight show 

3162
02:42:21,391 --> 02:42:23,280
with,
with the whatever as a comic I sustained

3163
02:42:24,040 --> 02:42:26,700
and that's the fucking epitome for one 
of us.

3164
02:42:26,730 --> 02:42:29,760
Whether he became a richard pryor or 
not.

3165
02:42:29,910 --> 02:42:31,710
He was on,
what's his name?

3166
02:42:32,100 --> 02:42:33,990
Come on fucking help me.
I have no idea.

3167
02:42:33,991 --> 02:42:38,991
Tonight show Johnny Carson.
Carson did stand up and johnny put them 

3168
02:42:38,991 --> 02:42:39,180
on the couch,
you know,

3169
02:42:39,290 --> 02:42:41,970
to derail the Georgia mccalvi was the 
real deal.

3170
02:42:42,300 --> 02:42:44,970
When george was 70,
I'll never forget.

3171
02:42:44,971 --> 02:42:45,990
He called me one night.
He's like,

3172
02:42:45,991 --> 02:42:46,850
hey,
what are you doing kid?

3173
02:42:46,870 --> 02:42:47,750
I go home to sydney.
He goes,

3174
02:42:47,770 --> 02:42:51,000
drive to Colorado springs and get 
onstage.

3175
02:42:51,080 --> 02:42:51,830
Open up me.
I go,

3176
02:42:51,831 --> 02:42:54,720
I can't get on that stage because of 
famous manager.

3177
02:42:55,410 --> 02:42:56,660
That was that.
That's that.

3178
02:42:56,680 --> 02:42:59,640
That club at the time [inaudible] 
wouldn't let you get on stage unless you

3179
02:42:59,641 --> 02:43:02,310
took a comedy class with 35 bucks.
Oh,

3180
02:43:02,311 --> 02:43:04,170
that was a scam.
Fuck,

3181
02:43:04,440 --> 02:43:08,730
I'll waive it.
So he threw me out on stage and this old

3182
02:43:08,731 --> 02:43:12,280
guy,
me that old guy had no career

3183
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:14,320
basically.
He did the local places.

3184
02:43:14,321 --> 02:43:18,700
He owned two clubs and he worked a 
couple clubs at,

3185
02:43:18,701 --> 02:43:22,150
hired him still he died on the road or 
whatever.

3186
02:43:22,151 --> 02:43:26,770
My point being that he helped me a lot 
as an old guy.

3187
02:43:26,771 --> 02:43:31,771
Like I looked at him and at first my 
first opinion of him was this whole 

3188
02:43:31,771 --> 02:43:31,771
losing.
No,

3189
02:43:31,771 --> 02:43:34,270
it wasn't a no loser.
He hadn't been doing it for 30 years.

3190
02:43:34,271 --> 02:43:38,290
He committed to this and no matter what 
his turnout was or whatever,

3191
02:43:38,291 --> 02:43:40,090
he was still a comedy.
He died a comic.

3192
02:43:40,750 --> 02:43:45,010
I talked to him maybe two years until he
died and I had lost contact with them.

3193
02:43:45,030 --> 02:43:47,450
Well george carlin died on the road.
You know,

3194
02:43:47,560 --> 02:43:49,630
my greatest of all time.
I don't want to die on the road.

3195
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:51,850
And then I know you don't want to die on
the road.

3196
02:43:51,910 --> 02:43:53,620
No,
but I can't.

3197
02:43:54,070 --> 02:43:56,980
For years I thought I wouldn't be doing 
this at 50.

3198
02:43:57,850 --> 02:44:01,840
Guess what?
I'm 55 and I'm still doing it.

3199
02:44:01,841 --> 02:44:04,690
This is what's important.
You're still letting it swing.

3200
02:44:05,290 --> 02:44:10,290
You're still having fun and doing a lot 
of crazy shit that gets you in a lot of 

3201
02:44:10,290 --> 02:44:10,290
trouble today.
This is what I brought up with.

3202
02:44:10,320 --> 02:44:11,650
We were talking about the,
you know,

3203
02:44:11,740 --> 02:44:16,740
in air quotes me to era.
People are going after people today for 

3204
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:19,240
good or for bad and to still have a 
wild,

3205
02:44:19,241 --> 02:44:23,350
controversial act in this politically.
Hold on one second.

3206
02:44:23,670 --> 02:44:25,690
What are we going after?
Me to people for?

3207
02:44:26,140 --> 02:44:27,950
For me,
taking him to back grabbing it.

3208
02:44:27,960 --> 02:44:32,960
Teddy's grabbing your pusher for you.
Sucking my dick for a movie role or for 

3209
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:36,751
something like that.
All those things really don't exist in 

3210
02:44:36,751 --> 02:44:36,751
my life,
right?

3211
02:44:36,751 --> 02:44:38,280
I have a wife and I have a child.
The only exist them right away.

3212
02:44:38,500 --> 02:44:42,780
If you want to come at me for sucking my
dick and night in 2002,

3213
02:44:42,940 --> 02:44:47,620
we were both doing blow be my guest,
be my guest,

3214
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:48,730
but I want to see footage.

3215
02:44:49,240 --> 02:44:52,060
I can be.
I'm sorry and take it and just.

3216
02:44:52,061 --> 02:44:53,920
You know what I'm saying?
There's a lot of people out there.

3217
02:44:53,921 --> 02:44:55,660
They're going to get me to look at this 
other guy.

3218
02:44:55,840 --> 02:44:57,730
For years he was known as a heroin 
addict,

3219
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:03,000
never got accused of sexual misconduct 
and some chicks that cima less than when

3220
02:45:03,041 --> 02:45:05,620
he was 11 years old and now he's like,
you need that,

3221
02:45:06,190 --> 02:45:08,620
you need that,
and the chicks on drugs.

3222
02:45:08,621 --> 02:45:11,170
She's doing the press conference while 
she's on drugs.

3223
02:45:11,440 --> 02:45:16,440
What's his name rather than one?
The guy that was in heat that the neuro 

3224
02:45:16,440 --> 02:45:19,150
put them in a rehaB himself and then he 
married heidi fleiss for awhile.

3225
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:24,800
Who was with tom?
That guy's been a junkie for 2000 years.

3226
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:30,510
All of a sudden.
Why can't I remember his last sizemore 

3227
02:45:30,510 --> 02:45:31,840
size?
Mom have some girl comes up when she had

3228
02:45:31,900 --> 02:45:33,700
26.
Yeah,

3229
02:45:33,701 --> 02:45:36,000
he molested me on a movie set when I was
11.

3230
02:45:36,030 --> 02:45:41,030
That's great and dandy dog.
But you can't ruin some of these life 

3231
02:45:41,030 --> 02:45:41,980
now,
but what do you think is happening?

3232
02:45:42,010 --> 02:45:43,780
This is my question,
like why are.

3233
02:45:43,840 --> 02:45:48,840
Why are people accepting these,
these situations like the chris hardwick

3234
02:45:48,911 --> 02:45:53,911
situation or why is everybody instantly 
thinking that the guy's guilty?

3235
02:45:54,370 --> 02:45:57,070
No one giving him the benefit of the 
doubt.

3236
02:45:57,071 --> 02:45:59,280
No court,
no justice court.

3237
02:45:59,290 --> 02:46:01,450
There's no nothing and in some some 
cases,

3238
02:46:01,451 --> 02:46:03,550
like the worst case was garrison 
keillor,

3239
02:46:03,670 --> 02:46:05,530
garrison keillor's,
the host of the lake,

3240
02:46:05,531 --> 02:46:09,460
woebegone chronicles like this radio 
show on pbs think it is,

3241
02:46:09,461 --> 02:46:10,070
is that what it is?

3242
02:46:10,580 --> 02:46:14,540
He apparently hugged a woman and his 
hand went down her back.

3243
02:46:14,590 --> 02:46:17,000
This is,
this is the depiction,

3244
02:46:17,360 --> 02:46:20,510
and he apologized to her and he sent her
an email.

3245
02:46:20,511 --> 02:46:21,590
She said,
don't Worry about it.

3246
02:46:21,591 --> 02:46:23,240
It's no big deal.
It was nothing.

3247
02:46:23,390 --> 02:46:25,550
And then they continued,
I believe,

3248
02:46:25,551 --> 02:46:30,551
to correspond and we're friends again 
and then this is all this stuff start 

3249
02:46:30,551 --> 02:46:35,381
happening with al franken.
And then he had this complaint brought 

3250
02:46:35,871 --> 02:46:39,110
up by this woman.
She reintroduced it and said that a long

3251
02:46:39,111 --> 02:46:44,111
time ago,
he put his hand on my back and they 

3252
02:46:44,111 --> 02:46:46,181
canceled the show.
They took his name off of it and they 

3253
02:46:46,181 --> 02:46:48,860
did it like really quickly and it's one 
of those things where you just go,

3254
02:46:48,861 --> 02:46:53,861
okay,
I really like the guy in one moment in 

3255
02:46:53,861 --> 02:46:56,210
time touches someone's back.
I don't know if it was creepy or not.

3256
02:46:56,420 --> 02:47:00,290
Let's assume it was a terrible error and
it was creepy.

3257
02:47:00,350 --> 02:47:02,540
I don't think it was.
I don't know.

3258
02:47:02,990 --> 02:47:05,930
I'm not saying I know,
but that's it.

3259
02:47:06,110 --> 02:47:10,040
Just touching someone's back and you.
That is a hysterical reaction.

3260
02:47:10,190 --> 02:47:15,190
That is hysteria.
That's almost the definition of 

3261
02:47:15,190 --> 02:47:17,561
hysteria.
If you're not talking about evil person 

3262
02:47:17,561 --> 02:47:17,561
talking about a person who touched 
someone's back,

3263
02:47:17,561 --> 02:47:21,851
like we got to be real careful with what
you destroy a person's whole life with.

3264
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,760
So on the one side you have the worst 
case scenario,

3265
02:47:25,761 --> 02:47:29,930
which is like a bill cosby who's 
drugging people and raping people.

3266
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:34,960
So worst case scenario for these 
powerful elite type people that are 

3267
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:38,930
getting these women into their web and 
pretend he's another one,

3268
02:47:39,680 --> 02:47:44,330
which they will all live on it and 
everybody knew about it was written into

3269
02:47:44,331 --> 02:47:47,660
his contract.
It was sexual harassment clauses were in

3270
02:47:47,661 --> 02:47:49,040
his contract,
right?

3271
02:47:49,140 --> 02:47:50,960
It wasn't that.
It was known for.

3272
02:47:51,270 --> 02:47:52,220
Make sure we're correct.

3273
02:47:52,680 --> 02:47:57,680
We really bothers me about harvey.
I'm going tell it what bothers me about 

3274
02:47:57,680 --> 02:47:58,250
harvey,
what we got to die.

3275
02:47:58,320 --> 02:48:03,320
There is a lot of people that have to be
indicted and this is one of my feeling 

3276
02:48:03,351 --> 02:48:04,300
right now.
This would be,

3277
02:48:04,640 --> 02:48:08,060
this should be a rico act.
This is the rico act.

3278
02:48:08,390 --> 02:48:12,520
Agents manages oprah,
eddie,

3279
02:48:12,620 --> 02:48:16,730
because everYbody knew everybody,
but here's a question.

3280
02:48:16,731 --> 02:48:21,731
How much do they know in 2005?
Everybody knew Joe Diaz was a kofi.

3281
02:48:23,240 --> 02:48:27,200
that's a dIfferent thing though to stay.
Let's pretend the same thing.

3282
02:48:27,201 --> 02:48:29,330
Okay,
but let's call Joe Davis is a coke feet.

3283
02:48:29,510 --> 02:48:33,140
It's 2007.
Joe is comes to a party house.

3284
02:48:33,410 --> 02:48:37,430
There's two cell phones missing.
Okay.

3285
02:48:37,490 --> 02:48:38,870
Let me.
Let me say this though.

3286
02:48:39,320 --> 02:48:44,320
Do you think that it's possible that his
behavior was shielded from some of the 

3287
02:48:44,320 --> 02:48:49,301
people that he interacted with,
like hillary clinton or oprah or bill 

3288
02:48:49,551 --> 02:48:52,220
clinton or whoever that was,
that they.

3289
02:48:52,390 --> 02:48:54,410
Some high profile people that he 
interacted with.

3290
02:48:54,440 --> 02:48:56,960
Is it possible that they didn't know?
Is it possible that they just thought he

3291
02:48:56,961 --> 02:49:01,961
was a pussy hounD or do you think they 
all knew he was a pussy hound and they 

3292
02:49:01,961 --> 02:49:04,850
heard little chitter chatter,
but it's okay.

3293
02:49:05,510 --> 02:49:08,150
It's okay.
Would just let him show

3294
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:09,610
me.
That's number one.

3295
02:49:10,180 --> 02:49:11,220
Number two,
jamie,

3296
02:49:11,221 --> 02:49:12,900
you ready for this?
Oh jesus.

3297
02:49:13,080 --> 02:49:14,730
Okay.
I see joe,

3298
02:49:14,731 --> 02:49:15,390
uh,
whatever.

3299
02:49:15,490 --> 02:49:18,190
Not now,
but Five years ago.

3300
02:49:19,540 --> 02:49:21,790
I see joel and the first thing I had to 
go with joe,

3301
02:49:21,820 --> 02:49:23,470
before you leave,
don't forget I got a.

3302
02:49:25,490 --> 02:49:28,310
What was that story would be about,
about benson.

3303
02:49:28,311 --> 02:49:33,311
Henderson is choke about a joke that 
somebody said the store going to place I

3304
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:40,680
went to and some chick took me in the 
back of suck my dick on the car and then

3305
02:49:41,011 --> 02:49:44,220
she stuck a finger in my ass and that's 
what we talked about.

3306
02:49:44,221 --> 02:49:49,221
So if that's what we talked about,
you're going to look me in the fucking 

3307
02:49:49,221 --> 02:49:53,010
face like a man that you are in,
the men that you've been around and told

3308
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:58,040
me harvey weinstein never turned to brad
or his other bodies and listen to.

3309
02:50:00,330 --> 02:50:03,190
Remind me to tell you the story about 
that dirty fucking battle

3310
02:50:04,450 --> 02:50:05,520
for sure.
Okay.

3311
02:50:05,521 --> 02:50:07,500
Then for sure.
But that was after that.

3312
02:50:07,580 --> 02:50:10,270
That's been admitted.
I think they've had conversations.

3313
02:50:10,300 --> 02:50:12,430
Oh my god.
If you don't think that the wig,

3314
02:50:12,490 --> 02:50:15,070
ben affleck and the other guy and I'm 
not offended.

3315
02:50:15,071 --> 02:50:16,770
No,
but I'm Just talking about boys.

3316
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:17,490
What boys?
Right.

3317
02:50:17,570 --> 02:50:19,120
And I have boys.
What?

3318
02:50:19,121 --> 02:50:20,380
You won't say that,
jamie,

3319
02:50:20,410 --> 02:50:23,170
you'll say to me because you're going 
watch blind date.

3320
02:50:23,740 --> 02:50:26,350
No,
I've never watched a movie blind date,

3321
02:50:27,340 --> 02:50:31,630
blind crackers going off in a movie 
named blind date with Bruce Willis.

3322
02:50:31,940 --> 02:50:33,320
Oh,
I remember that movie.

3323
02:50:33,370 --> 02:50:38,370
Kim bassinger,
how larry's came asked me just steals 

3324
02:50:38,370 --> 02:50:39,310
the show when she walks in,
the japanese lady and she was like,

3325
02:50:39,311 --> 02:50:44,311
you know,
you're entitled to 50 percent of your 

3326
02:50:44,311 --> 02:50:46,440
husband's assets in California.
And the chinese woman kept saying me,

3327
02:50:46,450 --> 02:50:47,410
no,
speak english.

3328
02:50:47,790 --> 02:50:48,870
Speak english.
I was like,

3329
02:50:48,910 --> 02:50:52,210
you don't even tell 50 percent as she 
opens up The door.

3330
02:50:52,210 --> 02:50:54,040
Fifty percent,
50 percent.

3331
02:50:54,460 --> 02:50:59,460
That movie is a great word,
but this is seen in the opening of that 

3332
02:50:59,460 --> 02:51:02,041
movie.
Both of those aCtors are around where 

3333
02:51:02,041 --> 02:51:02,080
the guy comes up to him.
He goes,

3334
02:51:02,140 --> 02:51:03,910
you're not gonna believe what happened 
last night.

3335
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:05,920
And Bruce Willis goes,
hey,

3336
02:51:05,930 --> 02:51:09,220
we go one of these fucking sex stories 
Again.

3337
02:51:09,660 --> 02:51:10,250
And he goes,
so,

3338
02:51:10,251 --> 02:51:11,190
um,
that's bongos.

3339
02:51:11,210 --> 02:51:16,120
I hope when I walk out with some lady,
pulls up with a limo and I say,

3340
02:51:16,121 --> 02:51:17,620
I've never been a little limo.
She goes,

3341
02:51:17,621 --> 02:51:22,621
we'll get in.
And we were riding down sunset hard 

3342
02:51:22,621 --> 02:51:23,500
times in the summer and the next thing 
you know,

3343
02:51:23,501 --> 02:51:27,200
she's sucking my dick.
She's got leotards on eating,

3344
02:51:27,240 --> 02:51:28,960
harass,
and he's telling the story.

3345
02:51:28,961 --> 02:51:29,760
And Bruce Willis,
listen,

3346
02:51:29,770 --> 02:51:30,760
when it goes,
no,

3347
02:51:30,980 --> 02:51:33,640
no,
why does this always happen to you?

3348
02:51:33,940 --> 02:51:35,200
This is some other bullshit.
He goes,

3349
02:51:36,840 --> 02:51:37,660
and he goes,
ms dot.

3350
02:51:37,830 --> 02:51:42,830
He starts whIpping out polaroids.
That I've always known one of those guys

3351
02:51:44,021 --> 02:51:45,880
in my life.
of course,

3352
02:51:45,940 --> 02:51:49,960
we've all known one guy in my life.
That was the difference between that guy

3353
02:51:50,050 --> 02:51:52,090
and what harvey.
Why don't believe stuff?

3354
02:51:52,430 --> 02:51:53,410
Yeah,
I know that.

3355
02:51:53,800 --> 02:51:55,330
But I also believe that harvey,

3356
02:51:55,460 --> 02:51:57,100
I was telling people

3357
02:51:58,050 --> 02:52:01,050
he probably was because listen,
everybody was telling him.

3358
02:52:01,051 --> 02:52:02,940
Was he telling him that he was holding 
people down?

3359
02:52:02,941 --> 02:52:04,440
What do they usually tell him?
What was he telling?

3360
02:52:04,470 --> 02:52:05,780
He was raping people ass.

3361
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:07,330
No,
not at all.

3362
02:52:07,480 --> 02:52:08,670
Do you think that he did?
Well,

3363
02:52:08,720 --> 02:52:11,540
you only want to use a piece of ass.
She's a piece of ass.

3364
02:52:11,610 --> 02:52:16,610
You've got to see her suck a dick.
She'll do anything she is an animal 

3365
02:52:16,610 --> 02:52:20,560
with.
That's what we do as men were 

3366
02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:22,021
braggadocio.
So there was like a community of that 

3367
02:52:22,021 --> 02:52:26,070
were actors and actresses.
I think he had four or five guys that 

3368
02:52:26,951 --> 02:52:31,951
knew what he was doing.
I want you to remember being 27 and 

3369
02:52:32,051 --> 02:52:36,070
having floor your boys that would come 
back every monday with a different story

3370
02:52:36,071 --> 02:52:37,690
to karate school.
Yeah.

3371
02:52:38,890 --> 02:52:41,050
Eight harassed.
I fucked her on fire.

3372
02:52:41,740 --> 02:52:44,350
Whatever the fuck is that yOu do.
he told somebody.

3373
02:52:44,351 --> 02:52:49,351
Somebody knew about all these stories.
Some agents knew somebody because for 

3374
02:52:50,200 --> 02:52:53,770
100 of them that said no and whatever.
That had to be.

3375
02:52:53,771 --> 02:52:55,690
Twenty five.
He was playing the percentages,

3376
02:52:55,700 --> 02:52:57,210
joe.
Well,

3377
02:52:57,280 --> 02:52:58,150
definitely.
In fact,

3378
02:52:58,151 --> 02:53:00,820
a lot of people said Yes.
They blamed that one girl.

3379
02:53:01,450 --> 02:53:05,710
They had the one girl that did rounders.
They accused her.

3380
02:53:06,440 --> 02:53:07,100
Yeah.
Heard that.

3381
02:53:07,230 --> 02:53:09,890
That played matt damon's girlfriend.
She was.

3382
02:53:09,900 --> 02:53:14,900
She went from being an extra and fucking
a donnie brasco to being the guest star.

3383
02:53:16,270 --> 02:53:17,920
Opposite fucking.
Yeah.

3384
02:53:17,930 --> 02:53:19,300
If you want to.
Donnie brasco,

3385
02:53:19,600 --> 02:53:21,790
she's what's his name?
Sonny black's girlfriend,

3386
02:53:22,050 --> 02:53:22,760
you know,
made lines.

3387
02:53:22,800 --> 02:53:23,650
She has in that movie

3388
02:53:25,720 --> 02:53:28,630
zero,
zero smart move.

3389
02:53:28,920 --> 02:53:33,040
And then a year later she's a fucking 
guest opposite.

3390
02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:36,540
So there's a bunch of them that said yes
to you,

3391
02:53:36,580 --> 02:53:38,110
but do you fault the girl for doing 
that?

3392
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:44,120
Have a girl decides to harvey weinstein 
on her own freewill and we come here 

3393
02:53:44,120 --> 02:53:47,950
with a dream and there's two ways to 
enhance that dream.

3394
02:53:48,740 --> 02:53:52,080
Because I always knew that I wasn't good
looking man.

3395
02:53:52,090 --> 02:53:55,470
I always knew I was fat.
Now I always knew I was already lit art.

3396
02:53:55,480 --> 02:53:58,480
Listening to what I always knew that I 
was funny.

3397
02:53:58,481 --> 02:54:03,481
So I always worked on being funny.
I didn't think somebody was on let me 

3398
02:54:03,481 --> 02:54:06,340
suck their dick or eat their pussy to be
a star.

3399
02:54:06,400 --> 02:54:09,870
So that was never in my mind.
But think about people who.

3400
02:54:10,720 --> 02:54:12,790
How many people have you met with sell 
that?

3401
02:54:12,791 --> 02:54:17,791
So when this town,
how many people have come and gone in 

3402
02:54:17,791 --> 02:54:20,281
front of you?
The reason why our friendship is still 

3403
02:54:20,281 --> 02:54:20,281
intact,
it's because you know more and worker,

3404
02:54:20,281 --> 02:54:21,610
you know,
always hard worker.

3405
02:54:22,030 --> 02:54:25,390
You respect hard work.
how many times did you pull me aside and

3406
02:54:25,391 --> 02:54:26,740
said,
look at this fucking clown.

3407
02:54:27,810 --> 02:54:30,700
You're not trying to be judgemental.
You just know that he's pulling the wool

3408
02:54:30,701 --> 02:54:35,701
over anybody's eyes.
We know who's talking to talk and 

3409
02:54:35,701 --> 02:54:36,930
walking the walk.
We see it on stage,

3410
02:54:37,260 --> 02:54:42,260
we hear about it.
We only twitter or facebook hear about 

3411
02:54:42,260 --> 02:54:42,400
it.
We get to that club.

3412
02:54:42,430 --> 02:54:45,280
The club owner otitis joel.
Joe was here two weeks ago.

3413
02:54:45,550 --> 02:54:48,670
He was falling asleep on stage.
You know his shit.

3414
02:54:48,690 --> 02:54:51,250
Right?
So it's the same thing.

3415
02:54:55,480 --> 02:54:56,140
Yeah.
No,

3416
02:54:56,141 --> 02:54:57,790
I think so.
I think,

3417
02:54:57,791 --> 02:55:02,791
um,
I think what's one of the things that 

3418
02:55:02,791 --> 02:55:03,980
stand up is good for is it's,
it's an

3419
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:08,870
exercise that you're doing while you're 
living your life and the better stand up

3420
02:55:08,871 --> 02:55:13,871
gets.
It's usually a better indication that 

3421
02:55:13,871 --> 02:55:16,061
you're thinking better.
Like your life's more in order you more 

3422
02:55:16,061 --> 02:55:16,061
tuned in,
you know,

3423
02:55:16,061 --> 02:55:18,950
you're dealing stuff that's hitting 
harder because you've got better points,

3424
02:55:18,951 --> 02:55:23,630
you know how to edit it better,
and they usually that you can use that.

3425
02:55:23,690 --> 02:55:24,920
I think it's like,
remember,

3426
02:55:24,921 --> 02:55:26,030
see,
remember that moving mo.

3427
02:55:26,031 --> 02:55:27,710
Betta blues',
denzel Washington.

3428
02:55:27,711 --> 02:55:32,711
I love that movie.
One of the things I loved about that 

3429
02:55:32,711 --> 02:55:34,871
movie,
I got inspired to work on my act after 

3430
02:55:34,871 --> 02:55:34,871
that movie.
I was like,

3431
02:55:34,871 --> 02:55:34,871
thinking about how much musicians 
practice.

3432
02:55:35,330 --> 02:55:36,070
He was just,
oh,

3433
02:55:36,071 --> 02:55:37,310
he's practicing.
And these girls,

3434
02:55:37,311 --> 02:55:39,470
these hot girls would want to fuck.
And you're like,

3435
02:55:39,471 --> 02:55:40,280
no,
not right now.

3436
02:55:40,310 --> 02:55:41,660
I got to practice.
I got to practice.

3437
02:55:41,661 --> 02:55:42,380
I was like,
damn,

3438
02:55:42,381 --> 02:55:47,381
the discipline crazy discipline that 
that man has to play that trumpet and 

3439
02:55:47,381 --> 02:55:47,870
practice it over and over again.

3440
02:55:48,110 --> 02:55:50,210
And it made me really think like as a 
comic,

3441
02:55:50,990 --> 02:55:53,600
we don't work like that.
We don't have to rehearse all day,

3442
02:55:53,940 --> 02:55:55,340
you know,
we don't really rehearse at all.

3443
02:55:55,460 --> 02:55:57,650
But musicians like a really good 
musician.

3444
02:55:57,651 --> 02:56:02,651
I mean they're always working,
they're always trying and training and 

3445
02:56:02,651 --> 02:56:04,010
working on their craft and we do it on 
stage in front of people.

3446
02:56:04,011 --> 02:56:09,011
Probably more than a lot of musicians do
unless they're constantly regularly 

3447
02:56:09,011 --> 02:56:10,000
touring.
But it's,

3448
02:56:10,160 --> 02:56:15,160
we don't,
we don't have that kind of a work ethic 

3449
02:56:15,160 --> 02:56:18,041
attached to what we do.
Like if you want to play a phenomenal 

3450
02:56:18,041 --> 02:56:18,041
trumpet,
those guys,

3451
02:56:18,041 --> 02:56:19,910
their breath control and the way they 
can blow those horns,

3452
02:56:19,911 --> 02:56:22,100
man,
they practice all the time.

3453
02:56:22,370 --> 02:56:25,460
They put an hours and hours working on 
that.

3454
02:56:25,810 --> 02:56:28,430
And I was thinking about it.
That's a different kind of craft.

3455
02:56:28,670 --> 02:56:30,250
It's a different kind of craft.
The,

3456
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:32,450
the ability to play a musician musical 
instrument,

3457
02:56:32,600 --> 02:56:36,470
the thing about standup that becomes a 
problem sometimes is that it's kind of,

3458
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:42,040
you can kind of pull it off like you 
could do it really well or you can kind 

3459
02:56:42,040 --> 02:56:42,800
of pull it off and to kind of pull it 
off.

3460
02:56:42,800 --> 02:56:47,800
You don't need a whole lot of effort and
just need a few good subjects and a few 

3461
02:56:47,800 --> 02:56:51,910
good ways of expressing it,
but to get that where you can kind of 

3462
02:56:51,910 --> 02:56:56,291
pull it off and turn it into a bit.
That just smashes a bit that you put it 

3463
02:56:56,291 --> 02:57:00,521
in the.
You can't wait to get to that punchline 

3464
02:57:00,521 --> 02:57:00,521
because you know it's gonna be a nuclear
bomb.

3465
02:57:00,521 --> 02:57:02,900
That's where the real work comes in and 
I think for a lot of us,

3466
02:57:02,990 --> 02:57:06,560
it's the difference between how much 
energy you put towards anything,

3467
02:57:06,561 --> 02:57:09,320
whether it's your standup comedy or 
painting or whatever the fuck you do.

3468
02:57:10,250 --> 02:57:11,540
How much energy put towards your 
writing,

3469
02:57:11,570 --> 02:57:13,220
how much energy to put towards thinking 
about it.

3470
02:57:13,460 --> 02:57:15,620
The more you can do,
the better it's going to be,

3471
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:18,560
and that's a fundamental thing that 
nobody ever tells you.

3472
02:57:18,680 --> 02:57:21,500
People tell you you should write,
but it's not just that you should write,

3473
02:57:21,830 --> 02:57:23,210
you should also listen to your shit.

3474
02:57:23,210 --> 02:57:28,210
You should also perform,
but the whole key to it all is just 

3475
02:57:28,210 --> 02:57:30,520
applying different kinds of focus 
towards your act and if you look at like

3476
02:57:30,530 --> 02:57:32,480
a movie like mo betta blues,
like he's doing,

3477
02:57:34,010 --> 02:57:39,010
he's playing that fucking trumpet and 
you realize like this guy is like lost 

3478
02:57:39,010 --> 02:57:42,440
in the act of practicing this beautiful 
musical instrument and this is his craft

3479
02:57:42,441 --> 02:57:45,470
and he takes pride and being excellent 
at his craft.

3480
02:57:45,471 --> 02:57:50,471
He could just hang around all day and 
still probably blowing awesome tune at 

3481
02:57:50,471 --> 02:57:50,471
night,
but no,

3482
02:57:50,471 --> 02:57:52,310
he fucking practices and I remember 
thinking about that going,

3483
02:57:52,311 --> 02:57:54,020
damn,
that's probably something that's missing

3484
02:57:54,021 --> 02:57:59,021
from the lives of most stand ups and I 
should probably try to think about that 

3485
02:57:59,021 --> 02:58:00,740
more with my own life.
I love.

3486
02:58:00,741 --> 02:58:01,710
I love the

3487
02:58:02,730 --> 02:58:06,330
writing and I love the performing.
I hate the listening.

3488
02:58:07,080 --> 02:58:08,210
Yeah,
that's a hard part.

3489
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:13,240
Listen,
this is very rough for me and I 

3490
02:58:13,240 --> 02:58:13,240
listened.
I forced myself in before the special.

3491
02:58:13,560 --> 02:58:18,000
I forced myself to listen a lot and it 
made me to fucking over critical,

3492
02:58:19,280 --> 02:58:24,280
you know,
got me to over fucking critical a week 

3493
02:58:24,280 --> 02:58:27,801
before I tape.
I also went to places that I didn't put 

3494
02:58:27,801 --> 02:58:30,660
my name on the gazebo just to see how my
job should do in front of regular people

3495
02:58:31,080 --> 02:58:32,730
and that fucked with my head a little 
bit.

3496
02:58:32,940 --> 02:58:35,340
A couple of little mistakes in training 
camp,

3497
02:58:36,120 --> 02:58:38,980
but that's a training camp before.
Don't worry you.

3498
02:58:39,640 --> 02:58:40,270
No,
I agree.

3499
02:58:40,310 --> 02:58:42,840
It's not been doing this for 27 years.
I loved doing it.

3500
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:46,560
I get better every fucking year.
My breathing,

3501
02:58:46,590 --> 02:58:51,590
I get something better going up on stage
or confidence levels and a talk.

3502
02:58:52,730 --> 02:58:54,210
It's 27 fucking years.

3503
02:58:54,660 --> 02:58:59,660
You're going to be doing 30 this year.
Next month is going to be 30 fucking 

3504
02:59:00,451 --> 02:59:05,451
years.
Did you ever see yourself doing this for

3505
02:59:05,731 --> 02:59:10,731
30 years?
I still remember walking into the main 

3506
02:59:10,831 --> 02:59:15,831
room and mitch,
he was in a booth and paul was onstage 

3507
02:59:15,831 --> 02:59:20,300
slice in that room apart and she called 
me over and she goes naturallY 

3508
02:59:21,310 --> 02:59:22,990
happening,
no income.

3509
02:59:23,030 --> 02:59:26,850
He 20 years and at that time I was like,
damn,

3510
02:59:27,060 --> 02:59:32,060
I've been doing comedy for 11.
I still did anotHer nine and now I'm at 

3511
02:59:33,001 --> 02:59:38,001
27.
Crazy and it's like you watch people 

3512
02:59:38,001 --> 02:59:38,610
like john john,
right?

3513
02:59:38,940 --> 02:59:43,940
Who will fuck you up effortlessly 
without even breathing heavy.

3514
02:59:44,730 --> 02:59:45,780
John jocko.
Yeah,

3515
02:59:45,890 --> 02:59:48,570
you'll be in.
You'll get that fucking hell.

3516
02:59:48,571 --> 02:59:50,700
You think you got them in the fucking 
guillotine.

3517
02:59:51,270 --> 02:59:56,270
Next thing you know you're on your back 
and looking up with the army and that's 

3518
02:59:56,440 --> 03:00:01,440
what we're doing right now.
I feel myself when I see a guy with a 

3519
03:00:01,440 --> 03:00:03,490
coral belt on,
I'm like,

3520
03:00:03,530 --> 03:00:05,400
that's the level now that we're at.

3521
03:00:05,610 --> 03:00:08,910
I can control a lot of shit.
Joe,

3522
03:00:08,911 --> 03:00:13,911
one of your secrets was following me.
It was putting yourself in bad 

3523
03:00:13,911 --> 03:00:18,261
positions,
which in jujitsu is like getting the 

3524
03:00:18,261 --> 03:00:18,261
biggest guy in the room and go,
hey,

3525
03:00:18,261 --> 03:00:21,690
you busy right now.
Did I tell you on the road with me?

3526
03:00:21,691 --> 03:00:24,570
They'd be like,
what the fuck is wrong of me?

3527
03:00:24,571 --> 03:00:29,571
And just choked me.
You taking me on the road is like 

3528
03:00:29,571 --> 03:00:30,270
somebody going,
hey,

3529
03:00:30,330 --> 03:00:33,390
come here for a second.
What do you wait $300?

3530
03:00:33,570 --> 03:00:37,000
I weigh 1:40,
get on top of me and amount.

3531
03:00:37,100 --> 03:00:41,790
I put one hand and we'll start there.
Let's start right there.

3532
03:00:42,020 --> 03:00:46,170
Start right fucking there.
Only if you think about it that way.

3533
03:00:46,200 --> 03:00:51,200
See,
this is what's important about it and 

3534
03:00:51,200 --> 03:00:51,690
there's one thing that's important about
traveling with all really funny people.

3535
03:00:52,190 --> 03:00:55,770
It only becomes a negative when you 
think at it as a negative.

3536
03:00:55,980 --> 03:01:00,980
When someone's funny,
you should be laughing and enjoying it 

3537
03:01:00,980 --> 03:01:00,980
and it

3538
03:01:00,980 --> 03:01:02,270
makes your time more enjoyable when you 
go on stage.

3539
03:01:02,271 --> 03:01:07,271
Yes it does.
I needed to learn that and the way I 

3540
03:01:07,271 --> 03:01:10,411
learned that,
one of the ways was going on the road 

3541
03:01:10,411 --> 03:01:12,301
with you.
I knew that you were going to crush and 

3542
03:01:12,301 --> 03:01:13,600
so I knew that everybody else would like
to take,

3543
03:01:13,780 --> 03:01:18,780
you know,
we were both relatively young in our 

3544
03:01:18,780 --> 03:01:18,780
comedy careers back then.
Right.

3545
03:01:18,780 --> 03:01:22,321
So it was like we're talking about,
I've been doing comedy maybe nine years 

3546
03:01:22,321 --> 03:01:24,220
or eight years.
You were a lot wiser about the game,

3547
03:01:24,310 --> 03:01:29,310
like you introduced me to shit,
but I've never even like I read a few 

3548
03:01:29,310 --> 03:01:30,760
books,
watched a few tapes,

3549
03:01:30,820 --> 03:01:33,670
but you had the practical knowledge that
I needed.

3550
03:01:33,730 --> 03:01:36,580
Like you were the votech school.
Well,

3551
03:01:36,581 --> 03:01:39,940
what I did is I thought about it the 
same way I thought about martial arts.

3552
03:01:40,150 --> 03:01:45,150
That's one of the reasons why I wanted 
to go on the road with your all the 

3553
03:01:45,150 --> 03:01:45,150
time.

3554
03:01:45,150 --> 03:01:47,490
I was like,
you don't get better or aspiring people 

3555
03:01:47,490 --> 03:01:49,141
that suck.
You get better when you spar with 

3556
03:01:49,141 --> 03:01:51,840
wizards.
You gotta be real careful when you're 

3557
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:51,840
sparring with wizards and so it was 
like,

3558
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:56,220
what I would need to do is have someone 
who goes on stage in front of me and 

3559
03:01:56,220 --> 03:01:59,191
just crushes and we had some.
I had some Tough sets going on after 

3560
03:01:59,191 --> 03:02:02,731
you.
I remember one time in rascals rascals 

3561
03:02:02,731 --> 03:02:02,800
and a west orange,
right?

3562
03:02:02,830 --> 03:02:05,470
Was in west orange or east orange,
west west orange,

3563
03:02:05,471 --> 03:02:07,900
New Jersey.
Fucking great club,

3564
03:02:07,930 --> 03:02:12,930
but you went up and you got into it with
some people in the audience about 

3565
03:02:12,930 --> 03:02:15,430
something and you were just on fire just
on fire.

3566
03:02:15,790 --> 03:02:20,790
You crushed and I had a real hard time 
going on after you and I remember 

3567
03:02:20,790 --> 03:02:20,790
thinking,
oh,

3568
03:02:20,790 --> 03:02:22,480
okay,
this is a very important lesson.

3569
03:02:22,510 --> 03:02:27,510
Like this is important.
Like there's something that I'm not 

3570
03:02:27,510 --> 03:02:27,510
doing right that he is doing right,
like,

3571
03:02:27,510 --> 03:02:27,510
what am I?

3572
03:02:27,510 --> 03:02:28,780
How come I'm not,
oh,

3573
03:02:28,781 --> 03:02:33,781
I'm nervous.
I'm nervous going on after him so I'm 

3574
03:02:33,781 --> 03:02:36,511
not having fun up there.
So he's having fun and I'm being tense 

3575
03:02:36,511 --> 03:02:36,511
going,
oh jesus,

3576
03:02:36,511 --> 03:02:40,771
it's better not suck,
so I'm putting in my head this better 

3577
03:02:40,771 --> 03:02:40,771
not suck.
It's the total wrong way to approach.

3578
03:02:40,771 --> 03:02:41,680
Like if you approached a fight like 
that,

3579
03:02:42,220 --> 03:02:43,480
man,
you're going to get smashed.

3580
03:02:43,510 --> 03:02:48,510
Most likely you want to approach a fight
thinking about the things you're going 

3581
03:02:48,510 --> 03:02:51,171
to do,
not the things that you want to like 

3582
03:02:51,171 --> 03:02:51,280
worry about what's going to happen if 
you get hit,

3583
03:02:51,310 --> 03:02:56,310
you don't think like that.
You just think about doing your thing 

3584
03:02:56,310 --> 03:02:58,780
and then adjusting along the way,
and I had the wrong mindset and I needed

3585
03:02:58,781 --> 03:03:01,570
to see someone kill a bunch of times in 
front of me and then bomb,

3586
03:03:01,571 --> 03:03:04,420
go after them to realize something's 
wrong here,

3587
03:03:04,720 --> 03:03:09,720
the wrong things,
and I'm going onstage tense because 

3588
03:03:09,720 --> 03:03:09,720
someone was funny.

3589
03:03:09,720 --> 03:03:10,630
That's ridiculous.
Like I should be the opposite.

3590
03:03:10,870 --> 03:03:14,950
I should be happy that someone was funny
because I love comedy and this is what I

3591
03:03:14,951 --> 03:03:15,910
like to do.
I mean,

3592
03:03:15,911 --> 03:03:18,460
I like to watch it if I'm not doing it,
so why am I so tense?

3593
03:03:18,810 --> 03:03:23,810
It was just a bad way of approaching a 
problem and I think this is one of the 

3594
03:03:23,810 --> 03:03:28,681
things that fucks people up in life.
You approach a problem the same way 

3595
03:03:28,681 --> 03:03:32,551
every time and you never stop and just 
completely look at the whole thing from 

3596
03:03:32,551 --> 03:03:33,700
the top down.
JusT look at the whole thing.

3597
03:03:33,701 --> 03:03:34,270
Go,
what?

3598
03:03:34,510 --> 03:03:39,510
What am I trying to do here?
I'm trying to get tighter and funnier 

3599
03:03:39,510 --> 03:03:42,601
and better.
What do I gotta do I gotta do a lot of 

3600
03:03:42,601 --> 03:03:44,461
sets.
I got to write and I got to work with 

3601
03:03:44,461 --> 03:03:44,461
murderers.
That was the key.

3602
03:03:44,461 --> 03:03:48,940
It's like working with guys like you and
all of us working together and also 

3603
03:03:48,940 --> 03:03:49,390
people knew if they came to see us like,
hey,

3604
03:03:49,391 --> 03:03:54,391
this isn't just going to be.
Joe goes up and he's the hero of the 

3605
03:03:54,391 --> 03:03:57,271
show.
Now you're going to get ari who's going 

3606
03:03:57,271 --> 03:03:57,271
to go on and murder your going to go on 
and murder and then I'm going to go up.

3607
03:03:57,560 --> 03:03:58,670
I mean,
it's a fucking

3608
03:03:58,790 --> 03:04:00,530
rock 'em sock.
'em robots show.

3609
03:04:00,531 --> 03:04:02,270
We had.
We went on the road,

3610
03:04:02,271 --> 03:04:05,270
dude.
We did cut college clubs or other across

3611
03:04:05,271 --> 03:04:06,800
the country.
We did.

3612
03:04:06,860 --> 03:04:08,510
I mean who knows how many fucking 
cities.

3613
03:04:08,511 --> 03:04:13,511
You and I and already toured on fucking 
crazy numbers just over and over again,

3614
03:04:14,451 --> 03:04:18,080
bonding together,
hundreds of shows together,

3615
03:04:18,290 --> 03:04:21,860
figuring out how to fucking get 
everything perfect.

3616
03:04:21,861 --> 03:04:25,160
Figure out the right amount of weed to 
smoke before you go on stage,

3617
03:04:25,310 --> 03:04:27,590
the right amount of getting joey diaz 
riled up.

3618
03:04:27,950 --> 03:04:32,950
You would come in yelling about 
something or hair or I want you to see 

3619
03:04:32,950 --> 03:04:32,950
something.
I'd go into the bathroom and they'd be a

3620
03:04:32,950 --> 03:04:37,871
shit.
It looks like a crocodile trying to 

3621
03:04:37,871 --> 03:04:37,871
crawl out of the toilet bowl.
All that stuff.

3622
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,160
That's some rock and roll comedy,
man.

3623
03:04:40,520 --> 03:04:42,350
You know,
it helped both of us.

3624
03:04:42,380 --> 03:04:47,380
It helped both of us a lot and it also 
like set a tone that I think for a lot 

3625
03:04:47,380 --> 03:04:51,700
of us,
like you should be with funny people 

3626
03:04:51,700 --> 03:04:51,700
should all.

3627
03:04:51,700 --> 03:04:53,480
Everybody should try hard.
Should not think that anybody doing good

3628
03:04:53,600 --> 03:04:54,920
is bad for you.
It's great.

3629
03:04:54,950 --> 03:04:59,950
it's great for you.
It's great for everybody that 

3630
03:04:59,950 --> 03:05:00,410
everybody's like doing good together is 
better for everybody.

3631
03:05:00,440 --> 03:05:04,420
When I go on the road now I go onto the 
road and those joe rogan principles,

3632
03:05:05,650 --> 03:05:07,160
right?
That's my whole road thing.

3633
03:05:07,400 --> 03:05:12,400
The only thing I added to the leg added 
to it is my travel fast.

3634
03:05:13,101 --> 03:05:15,950
I don't fuck around.
I don't want to see nobody.

3635
03:05:16,720 --> 03:05:18,160
I'm.
Yeah,

3636
03:05:18,410 --> 03:05:19,580
go right over there.
You know,

3637
03:05:19,581 --> 03:05:22,240
there's no radio necessary.
I played just like,

3638
03:05:22,260 --> 03:05:23,370
you know,
we,

3639
03:05:24,360 --> 03:05:27,830
they'll try because they have 
relationships with local radio stations.

3640
03:05:27,831 --> 03:05:28,380
They like,
you know,

3641
03:05:28,410 --> 03:05:31,490
casey ewi wants to get you in there.
Cool.

3642
03:05:31,790 --> 03:05:35,270
I go in because you want to talk to the 
people on the way up.

3643
03:05:35,460 --> 03:05:40,460
The same people for sure way down.
There's a lot of people that were there 

3644
03:05:40,460 --> 03:05:40,460
for me when I was in.

3645
03:05:40,460 --> 03:05:44,200
Sorry to do this station.
The problem is the waking up in the 

3646
03:05:44,200 --> 03:05:47,231
morning but just killed.
It just kills her and you've got to get 

3647
03:05:47,231 --> 03:05:49,010
in there a day earlier because if you 
want to do friday morning,

3648
03:05:49,011 --> 03:05:51,250
you gotta get in there thursday now.
You can't just show up friday,

3649
03:05:51,270 --> 03:05:52,190
3:00
in the afternoon.

3650
03:05:52,191 --> 03:05:54,380
I can't do it.
I fly out thursday.

3651
03:05:54,381 --> 03:05:56,840
It fucking sucks man.
That's the best you got out of me,

3652
03:05:57,230 --> 03:06:02,230
right?
Because was I got the family and I got 

3653
03:06:02,230 --> 03:06:02,230
people.
We got a lot of shit.

3654
03:06:02,230 --> 03:06:05,201
It's not like it used to be mad so.
But the thing that I love about this 

3655
03:06:05,361 --> 03:06:07,400
time is that even though people are 
super sensitive,

3656
03:06:07,401 --> 03:06:12,401
like we were talking about,
people are real sensitive about getting 

3657
03:06:12,401 --> 03:06:13,700
in trouble for stuff.
There's still rock 'em sock 'em robots,

3658
03:06:13,701 --> 03:06:16,340
comedy going on.
It's still wild up there.

3659
03:06:16,610 --> 03:06:20,180
Like dudes are still doing crazy fucking
jokes.

3660
03:06:20,420 --> 03:06:25,420
It's fun.
People taking real chances that doing 

3661
03:06:25,420 --> 03:06:25,800
real stand up,
you know,

3662
03:06:25,801 --> 03:06:27,880
and there's a lot of them that's built 
burr.

3663
03:06:28,160 --> 03:06:29,960
There's.
You can go down the list.

3664
03:06:30,070 --> 03:06:32,450
Ari,
ari's doing real standup.

3665
03:06:32,510 --> 03:06:34,730
You know,
there's a bunch of real killers now.

3666
03:06:34,890 --> 03:06:37,670
Santino,
he's doing some dangerous stand up.

3667
03:06:38,070 --> 03:06:40,590
You know,
I'm writing for my.

3668
03:06:40,930 --> 03:06:42,220
That's it.
Like the reason,

3669
03:06:42,370 --> 03:06:44,420
the point of that fucking story I told 
you,

3670
03:06:44,990 --> 03:06:49,990
being on top of that hill at 17 and 
being homeless is because I had a lot of

3671
03:06:50,601 --> 03:06:55,601
chances to ice myself.
Show has a lot of chaNces to ice myself

3672
03:06:56,110 --> 03:07:00,450
that could get not a fucking prison.
And thinking about getting out on bail.

3673
03:07:00,540 --> 03:07:03,810
when I got out on bail,
I had a lot of fucking doubts my friend.

3674
03:07:04,410 --> 03:07:09,410
Thank you.
Get not a bail and knowing you're going 

3675
03:07:09,410 --> 03:07:09,960
to look at 48 fucking years and you're a
fucking loser as it is.

3676
03:07:10,740 --> 03:07:15,000
Think of all those opportunities.
I used to break into a friend's house to

3677
03:07:15,001 --> 03:07:20,001
sleep in this house at night.
I slept in a rocket ship for a month 

3678
03:07:20,001 --> 03:07:24,830
outside of the park.
You and see those rocket ships and your 

3679
03:07:24,830 --> 03:07:28,161
kids play on them.
I still remember going up to the third 

3680
03:07:28,161 --> 03:07:28,161
floor,
the rocketship finishing off my coke and

3681
03:07:28,161 --> 03:07:33,111
jerking off on the third floor at five 
in the morning outside in the fucking 

3682
03:07:33,480 --> 03:07:38,480
park with leaves around me and shit.
So it was a lot of times I had that one.

3683
03:07:40,480 --> 03:07:42,350
It's amazing.
You have no fucking idea.

3684
03:07:42,350 --> 03:07:47,350
I would go up to the third floor with a 
bottle of fucking schmear silver vodka,

3685
03:07:48,350 --> 03:07:50,460
a bag,
a hooded sweatshirt,

3686
03:07:50,550 --> 03:07:55,550
gloves with a missing finger so I could 
fucking touch the rock and put them in 

3687
03:07:56,431 --> 03:07:59,530
my nose and shit.
You know?

3688
03:07:59,720 --> 03:08:04,720
No,
that's funny on the way up the stairs 

3689
03:08:04,720 --> 03:08:04,720
and shit.
But when you're.

3690
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:07,160
When you come down and you're in that 
rocket ship,

3691
03:08:07,200 --> 03:08:12,200
it's five in the morning.
It's 22 below zero and you're thinking 

3692
03:08:12,961 --> 03:08:14,330
to yourself,
fucking god took a.

3693
03:08:14,331 --> 03:08:17,940
When my mother got did this,
this is all god's fault because it's the

3694
03:08:18,030 --> 03:08:21,510
same guy I was raised to believe that 
was going to help me,

3695
03:08:21,810 --> 03:08:26,810
is doing all this.
Lot of times I wanted to fucking do a 

3696
03:08:26,810 --> 03:08:27,080
swan dive,
but I didn't.

3697
03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:29,740
You know,
it's so fucking weird.

3698
03:08:29,741 --> 03:08:32,630
That was in those positions for a long 
time.

3699
03:08:32,650 --> 03:08:35,550
Joe.
Now I got to look at you and go,

3700
03:08:35,551 --> 03:08:37,500
jesus christ,
look at what I turned this.

3701
03:08:37,530 --> 03:08:37,920
No,
no.

3702
03:08:37,980 --> 03:08:40,080
Tina turner'S son killed himself 
yesterday.

3703
03:08:40,530 --> 03:08:43,100
It wasn't.
I thought it was like son with her,

3704
03:08:43,770 --> 03:08:48,770
you know,
this trend of fucking people isin 

3705
03:08:48,770 --> 03:08:48,770
themselves.
That scares me.

3706
03:08:48,770 --> 03:08:49,630
That concerns me.
Is this something where we're eating?

3707
03:08:49,650 --> 03:08:51,670
This is something that we're getting 
weakened,

3708
03:08:52,080 --> 03:08:57,080
you know,
there was no drugs and bourdain system 

3709
03:08:57,080 --> 03:08:57,080
so we can't blame fucking prescription

3710
03:08:57,080 --> 03:09:00,690
drugs while he was on one medication,
some sort of medication.

3711
03:09:01,090 --> 03:09:04,500
Um,
and it was something that was prescribed

3712
03:09:04,501 --> 03:09:09,501
for them.
Someone told me that it was malaria 

3713
03:09:09,501 --> 03:09:09,501
medication.
I don't know,

3714
03:09:09,501 --> 03:09:09,501
probably,
I don't know if they've released that,

3715
03:09:09,501 --> 03:09:11,460
but I'm sure he had to take some of that
stuff sometimes,

3716
03:09:11,461 --> 03:09:16,461
but you know,
you don't know what it was that did him 

3717
03:09:16,461 --> 03:09:16,461
in.
According to some people,

3718
03:09:16,461 --> 03:09:17,800
he really wasn't doing well.
You know,

3719
03:09:17,801 --> 03:09:18,540
I don't,
I don't know.

3720
03:09:18,541 --> 03:09:20,220
I need to.
I mean,

3721
03:09:20,250 --> 03:09:25,250
it's almost unnecessary to get,
for me to get the full story.

3722
03:09:25,470 --> 03:09:26,910
I missed the guy.
He's gone.

3723
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:28,150
That's it.
You know what I mean?

3724
03:09:28,200 --> 03:09:33,200
I don't need to.
I think when whenever someone does 

3725
03:09:33,200 --> 03:09:34,410
something like that,
whatever it is,

3726
03:09:34,411 --> 03:09:36,450
if there's one thing that people could 
point to and say,

3727
03:09:36,451 --> 03:09:41,451
hey,
there's a chemical that's responsible 

3728
03:09:41,451 --> 03:09:43,221
for this,
or there's a gene problems responsible 

3729
03:09:43,221 --> 03:09:46,551
for this or the like,
how could someone who's loved so much 

3730
03:09:46,551 --> 03:09:49,800
want to step out?
I mean that must be a terrible moment of

3731
03:09:49,950 --> 03:09:51,870
pain to want to do it.

3732
03:09:52,400 --> 03:09:54,310
I had ever been on the computer 
listening

3733
03:09:54,310 --> 03:09:59,310
to music on youtube and you're right and
it just keeps playing songs and you 

3734
03:09:59,341 --> 03:10:00,540
know,
you don't have no control,

3735
03:10:00,541 --> 03:10:02,940
but I think I started with lending skin 
skinner,

3736
03:10:02,980 --> 03:10:07,350
a simple man kept going to the one 
that's going to trip and I went.

3737
03:10:07,370 --> 03:10:12,370
I came back and at one point blow up the
outside world and I'm sitting there and 

3738
03:10:13,481 --> 03:10:17,200
he says that line about going out or 
something.

3739
03:10:17,860 --> 03:10:21,310
Joe rogan,
my lip started shaking like,

3740
03:10:21,311 --> 03:10:26,311
I'm like,
I don't even know this guy and I miss 

3741
03:10:26,311 --> 03:10:26,311
him.
This guy,

3742
03:10:26,311 --> 03:10:27,100
you want me to look you people will tell
you.

3743
03:10:27,101 --> 03:10:28,250
I know.
I met her.

3744
03:10:28,260 --> 03:10:29,500
I met chris.
I don't know.

3745
03:10:29,501 --> 03:10:30,850
I don't know.
I never,

3746
03:10:30,870 --> 03:10:34,270
I saw him one time at the comedy store,
60 feet away from me,

3747
03:10:34,271 --> 03:10:35,800
chris cornell,
that's it.

3748
03:10:36,280 --> 03:10:40,510
And I started crying like how could 
somebody like this go in a room and just

3749
03:10:40,511 --> 03:10:41,380
iced themselves?

3750
03:10:41,650 --> 03:10:46,650
Is this what I'm going to do because I'm
in this fucking entertainment field 

3751
03:10:46,650 --> 03:10:49,840
because what happens?
And then I think about all these times.

3752
03:10:49,960 --> 03:10:54,960
One time I broke into my friend's house 
and I broken the window and it was 

3753
03:10:54,960 --> 03:10:56,170
freezing so I couldn't even sleep in 
that room.

3754
03:10:56,171 --> 03:10:59,590
I had to sleep in the hallway and there 
was a mattress on the wall that had like

3755
03:10:59,591 --> 03:11:04,591
piss stains from older kids and I pulled
it down and I slept on it and when I 

3756
03:11:04,591 --> 03:11:06,400
woke up he got a dog and it was too 
cold.

3757
03:11:06,401 --> 03:11:11,401
He just let the dog shit downstairs and 
there was like 20 pieces of little 

3758
03:11:11,410 --> 03:11:15,600
rolled up shit that had been like when 
the juice goes out of them,

3759
03:11:15,601 --> 03:11:19,520
they just roll up.
Once those things that you use it as one

3760
03:11:19,660 --> 03:11:23,440
of those accordion accordion,
it was like a piece of shit straight.

3761
03:11:23,440 --> 03:11:26,190
It's like an accordion.
What the moisture goes out of it.

3762
03:11:26,191 --> 03:11:30,330
It really does take a shit that's this 
big and you put it in a box.

3763
03:11:30,331 --> 03:11:32,790
come back a week later.
It's like this big,

3764
03:11:33,110 --> 03:11:36,060
how do I know that?
Because I didn't to a guy in prison took

3765
03:11:36,061 --> 03:11:41,061
a shit in the welfare box.
One time jesus boxes of cheese with the 

3766
03:11:41,061 --> 03:11:45,501
cheese comes in american cheese.
This dude had long hair and will always 

3767
03:11:45,501 --> 03:11:48,650
try to play me like he was with the 
biker dudes comebacks for him.

3768
03:11:48,660 --> 03:11:51,330
But he played he where he lived in a key
working in the kitchen.

3769
03:11:51,720 --> 03:11:55,080
He forgot I ran the kitchen and there 
was all me and black dudes.

3770
03:11:55,500 --> 03:12:00,500
So when dad got one of the welfare 
cheese boxes and I took like a 22,

3771
03:12:00,630 --> 03:12:03,210
24 inch,
it looks like a lizard.

3772
03:12:04,160 --> 03:12:06,380
It was just a long like,
you know.

3773
03:12:06,480 --> 03:12:11,480
Then at the end,
like one of those things that like a 

3774
03:12:11,480 --> 03:12:14,060
snail brown snail mail,
I fit perfectly into this cheese box and

3775
03:12:15,211 --> 03:12:20,211
I took a flag,
an american flag from the cheese and I 

3776
03:12:20,211 --> 03:12:23,541
put it on and I put it in this drawer 
and every night and he had the first 

3777
03:12:23,911 --> 03:12:28,911
bunk on the way out so that everybody 
had a walk and all the black guys were 

3778
03:12:28,911 --> 03:12:30,250
opened that door and go,
god damn,

3779
03:12:30,251 --> 03:12:31,860
it smells like shit in this 
motherfucker.

3780
03:12:32,130 --> 03:12:33,720
And he kept saying,
I know it does.

3781
03:12:33,960 --> 03:12:35,070
I don't want to answer it.
I was like,

3782
03:12:35,071 --> 03:12:38,390
shit in there and after like a month 
when they went draw,

3783
03:12:39,360 --> 03:12:40,470
everybody kept saying,
man,

3784
03:12:40,471 --> 03:12:42,960
it smells like shit.
Then he went in this drawer,

3785
03:12:42,961 --> 03:12:44,970
opened it up,
and they found this box.

3786
03:12:45,450 --> 03:12:47,820
He opened it up and I never forget him 
knocking.

3787
03:12:47,860 --> 03:12:52,860
I'm like going,
I'm going to find out who did this to 

3788
03:12:52,860 --> 03:12:52,860
me,
what they do to you.

3789
03:12:53,020 --> 03:12:54,060
And he goes,
look at this.

3790
03:12:54,061 --> 03:12:54,790
And like,
well what is it?

3791
03:12:54,791 --> 03:12:59,791
And I knew his shit had shrunken down 
from the 24 inches to six inches.

3792
03:13:02,090 --> 03:13:04,580
Just shrunk down with all the moisture 
goes out.

3793
03:13:05,090 --> 03:13:10,090
It just shrunk down like a fucking.
I don't even know why I'm telling you 

3794
03:13:10,090 --> 03:13:11,360
that story.
That's hilarious story.

3795
03:13:11,600 --> 03:13:14,030
That's fucking crazy.
It's a hilarious story.

3796
03:13:15,380 --> 03:13:16,730
He's a fun times.
Joey diaz.

3797
03:13:16,731 --> 03:13:18,620
I think we're the last of the regular 
humans.

3798
03:13:19,290 --> 03:13:22,220
I think we got our children's 
generation.

3799
03:13:22,221 --> 03:13:25,310
Maybe one more after that and I really 
do believe it's over.

3800
03:13:25,610 --> 03:13:27,530
I think we're going to integrate with 
fucking computers.

3801
03:13:27,531 --> 03:13:32,531
I think we're real close to it now.
Can even go whole podcast without 

3802
03:13:32,531 --> 03:13:32,531
looking on our phone.
Oh,

3803
03:13:32,531 --> 03:13:34,040
what time is it?
You know,

3804
03:13:34,190 --> 03:13:37,370
It's weird.
We're going to integrate with computers.

3805
03:13:37,580 --> 03:13:39,350
We're going to all be living in some 
weird world.

3806
03:13:39,380 --> 03:13:41,270
we got this fucking virtual reality 
thing here.

3807
03:13:41,270 --> 03:13:44,420
Now.
The htc vibe should try this thing out.

3808
03:13:44,780 --> 03:13:48,260
It was freaking the fuck out.
You think you're another place.

3809
03:13:48,710 --> 03:13:53,710
There's a zombie games and games where 
you're on top of a castle defending the 

3810
03:13:53,841 --> 03:13:58,841
castle,
shooting arrows down at monsters that 

3811
03:13:58,841 --> 03:14:01,511
are coming at you.
We're wearing 10 to a weird world right 

3812
03:14:01,511 --> 03:14:01,511
now.
Joey diaz.

3813
03:14:01,670 --> 03:14:04,190
Computers.
Too much information.

3814
03:14:04,200 --> 03:14:08,200
Joe rogan part of these thIngs too much 
and from what?

3815
03:14:08,210 --> 03:14:09,770
Listen,
I'm this thing,

3816
03:14:09,771 --> 03:14:12,410
I do not have social media.
Good for You.

3817
03:14:12,440 --> 03:14:14,200
You do know that I only have twitter on 
it.

3818
03:14:14,510 --> 03:14:15,500
Oh,
that's social media.

3819
03:14:15,650 --> 03:14:19,000
I don't have facebook.
I don't have nothing on social media.

3820
03:14:19,560 --> 03:14:21,080
My hotmail.
Hotmail.

3821
03:14:21,200 --> 03:14:26,200
Oh nobody.
Even people when I tell people out 

3822
03:14:26,200 --> 03:14:26,200
middle,
they go,

3823
03:14:26,200 --> 03:14:28,670
what the fuck are you talking about?
So you limit your into your interaction.

3824
03:14:28,880 --> 03:14:29,870
That's good.
That's smart.

3825
03:14:29,871 --> 03:14:31,520
And limit my interaction.
I'm the road.

3826
03:14:31,520 --> 03:14:33,980
The ipad.
No social media.

3827
03:14:34,130 --> 03:14:39,130
I'm convinced we're going to flex and a 
writing on my ipod.

3828
03:14:39,770 --> 03:14:41,510
That's it.
What do you use for writing app?

3829
03:14:42,430 --> 03:14:45,490
Whatever came with it.
Writing whatever it section.

3830
03:14:45,500 --> 03:14:48,950
So I have jones books,
I have chapters.

3831
03:14:49,040 --> 03:14:50,530
This died.
Thoughts.

3832
03:14:50,730 --> 03:14:52,550
So I'm working on.
Is it notes?

3833
03:14:52,551 --> 03:14:57,551
Is that what you write on?
I don't know what it's because like 

3834
03:14:57,551 --> 03:14:57,551
they,
it looks like yellow paper.

3835
03:14:57,551 --> 03:14:57,551
No,
no,

3836
03:14:57,551 --> 03:14:57,760
no,
no,

3837
03:14:57,770 --> 03:15:00,770
no,
no notes I have on the phone and I write

3838
03:15:00,771 --> 03:15:05,771
on here from time to time,
but nothing too follow you write it on 

3839
03:15:05,771 --> 03:15:06,320
something that's on your ipad.
Yeah.

3840
03:15:06,440 --> 03:15:11,440
So what I do is I'll write on a notebook
in the mornings and then once I take the

3841
03:15:12,621 --> 03:15:17,621
baby to whatever,
I go to the coffee shop in and transfer 

3842
03:15:17,621 --> 03:15:19,160
it if I really like it to the ipad and 
I'll work on it from there,

3843
03:15:19,970 --> 03:15:24,970
and then I look at the whole thing as a 
whole and stuff and the notebook and I 

3844
03:15:24,970 --> 03:15:28,211
don't know my spelling and I can't 
remember what that word was and the 

3845
03:15:28,211 --> 03:15:32,411
social media part is a big part of all 
this that I'm talking about and said 

3846
03:15:32,411 --> 03:15:35,320
we're just getting closer and closer to 
each other in some weird ways is going 

3847
03:15:35,320 --> 03:15:38,180
to be nothing compared to the next wave,
whatever the next wave is,

3848
03:15:38,270 --> 03:15:38,900
what they really do.

3849
03:15:38,900 --> 03:15:43,900
Figure out a way to integrate either 
virtual reality or what they're calling 

3850
03:15:43,900 --> 03:15:47,710
augmented reality.
What you'll wear a pair of sunglasses 

3851
03:15:47,710 --> 03:15:47,710
and you could have google maps sitting 
up on it.

3852
03:15:48,080 --> 03:15:50,580
He can google things.
You could see images

3853
03:15:50,580 --> 03:15:53,580
give you navigation.
It's going to get real weird.

3854
03:15:53,581 --> 03:15:54,660
Joe.
I see joe rogan.

3855
03:15:54,661 --> 03:15:56,440
I'm still a fan of life.
Me too.

3856
03:15:56,441 --> 03:16:01,380
It bothers people and it bothers me when
somebody is not a fan of life,

3857
03:16:01,410 --> 03:16:03,990
so I don't want him around me anymore.
Who's not a family life.

3858
03:16:04,090 --> 03:16:06,360
A lot of people we forgot.
We forgot.

3859
03:16:06,410 --> 03:16:06,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

3860
03:16:06,820 --> 03:16:09,150
Too many cameras.
Too many pictures,

3861
03:16:09,660 --> 03:16:11,280
too many videos.
Listen,

3862
03:16:11,281 --> 03:16:16,281
I was raised in society.
You don't see too many really talked to 

3863
03:16:16,281 --> 03:16:16,860
me to find pictures of me as a young 
kid.

3864
03:16:18,480 --> 03:16:19,560
Really thought,
yeah,

3865
03:16:19,561 --> 03:16:24,561
there's not a lot of pictures taken back
in society where and I came from a 

3866
03:16:24,561 --> 03:16:25,110
society will put the camera away.
Right.

3867
03:16:25,290 --> 03:16:26,010
Good.
What's that?

3868
03:16:26,140 --> 03:16:29,230
For tHe camera?
Yeah.

3869
03:16:29,880 --> 03:16:31,420
Why but put the camera.
Well,

3870
03:16:31,430 --> 03:16:33,180
we need more of that backstage,
right?

3871
03:16:33,970 --> 03:16:36,210
My way.
You know we live.

3872
03:16:36,270 --> 03:16:37,920
You know I,
I'm a stern believer.

3873
03:16:37,920 --> 03:16:41,460
I don't like text messages because I'm a
prick or a douche bag.

3874
03:16:41,820 --> 03:16:44,720
I want to hit joe rogan's voice.
No,

3875
03:16:44,730 --> 03:16:47,250
we've taught some people.
I don't want your fucking voice.

3876
03:16:47,700 --> 03:16:49,980
I want to hear your voice because I know
what you're thinking.

3877
03:16:49,981 --> 03:16:52,830
If I hear you voice it,
can't I care about you?

3878
03:16:53,010 --> 03:16:55,170
I care about you too.
So I want to hear your voice.

3879
03:16:55,410 --> 03:16:58,260
I told us telling people that I love 
that thing that you do,

3880
03:16:58,261 --> 03:17:00,570
like you don't want to have My one 
friend.

3881
03:17:00,571 --> 03:17:02,610
The only time I ever texted you is if 
you text me first.

3882
03:17:02,611 --> 03:17:04,140
Yeah,
I texted you back,

3883
03:17:04,410 --> 03:17:06,690
but I call you.
We talk on the phone.

3884
03:17:06,780 --> 03:17:08,700
You have to check in.
You have to have that.

3885
03:17:08,701 --> 03:17:10,890
You.
You have to be as human.

3886
03:17:10,920 --> 03:17:13,380
These days.
I don't have nothing on my books.

3887
03:17:14,170 --> 03:17:16,200
I don't want to do comedy,
but guess what I'll do.

3888
03:17:16,710 --> 03:17:21,710
I'll push myself.
I'll be sore and I pushed myself to go 

3889
03:17:21,710 --> 03:17:24,360
row because that's human contact and 
it's.

3890
03:17:24,420 --> 03:17:25,410
It's,
it's,

3891
03:17:25,440 --> 03:17:30,440
it's the most positive human contact 
you'll ever think about your role on the

3892
03:17:34,171 --> 03:17:39,171
street with fighting about something 
means knuckles and I grabbed you and 

3893
03:17:39,171 --> 03:17:41,970
pull you into cars.
If I'm fucking,

3894
03:17:42,240 --> 03:17:45,090
that's is human,
so I know I'm not going to do this,

3895
03:17:45,110 --> 03:17:46,980
but I'm not going to do that.
Then to rent a lIttle bit,

3896
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:49,520
maybe spend some time with the girls.
Maybe I'm gonna.

3897
03:17:49,540 --> 03:17:52,370
Take the girls for dinner,
but I also know that I'm gonna.

3898
03:17:52,860 --> 03:17:56,730
Make myself have that human contact of 
jujitsu.

3899
03:17:57,350 --> 03:17:57,720
You,
oh,

3900
03:17:57,721 --> 03:17:58,610
you're gay.
Joe,

3901
03:17:58,611 --> 03:18:01,250
are you just a closet fag roller with 
men.

3902
03:18:01,440 --> 03:18:03,960
That's great,
but I had human contact.

3903
03:18:03,961 --> 03:18:06,480
I had an emotion.
I shook hands with the guy.

3904
03:18:06,670 --> 03:18:11,670
The guy sweat on me and I sweat on a man
which builds a certain type of emotion 

3905
03:18:11,670 --> 03:18:13,980
between two men and then they'll have to
be a homosexual.

3906
03:18:14,550 --> 03:18:17,010
That's a different type of fucking man.
It really is.

3907
03:18:17,070 --> 03:18:22,070
It is.
When you stop what you're doing and go 

3908
03:18:22,070 --> 03:18:22,070
jojo.
Jojo.

3909
03:18:22,070 --> 03:18:25,491
Jojo stopped after.
Get the hook and while you're teaching 

3910
03:18:25,491 --> 03:18:29,181
me something,
I'm sweating my fat fucking potato 

3911
03:18:29,181 --> 03:18:30,630
chips.
Sweat is landing on joe rogan's neck.

3912
03:18:30,631 --> 03:18:32,710
but you going joe,
he grabbed my neck.

3913
03:18:34,310 --> 03:18:36,000
Squeeze.
Yeah,

3914
03:18:36,460 --> 03:18:37,980
there you go.
Now do that to me.

3915
03:18:37,981 --> 03:18:42,981
Next time.
You know what that does to your psyche 

3916
03:18:42,981 --> 03:18:45,801
as a man that a man that's beating you 
is teaching you how to get up.

3917
03:18:48,490 --> 03:18:50,350
So joe,
I got in this guillotine,

3918
03:18:50,380 --> 03:18:53,830
but stick in co and you're sweating and 
you're like,

3919
03:18:55,980 --> 03:18:56,500
no,
no,

3920
03:18:56,520 --> 03:18:58,240
no.
don't just put your hand in at one time.

3921
03:18:58,570 --> 03:19:00,660
Just squeeze real tight.
Good.

3922
03:19:00,670 --> 03:19:01,300
Joey,
joey,

3923
03:19:01,301 --> 03:19:02,730
joey,
you fucking killing me.

3924
03:19:02,740 --> 03:19:03,310
Jesus.
Joe,

3925
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:06,490
that's a complete different part of a 
man.

3926
03:19:06,880 --> 03:19:11,880
I think so too.
I think that that you think is good for 

3927
03:19:11,880 --> 03:19:12,370
you.
No human contact.

3928
03:19:12,550 --> 03:19:17,550
It also alleviates the tension of like 
men have tension that they might get 

3929
03:19:17,550 --> 03:19:19,570
into a physical altercation.
You don't think that way.

3930
03:19:19,571 --> 03:19:20,810
If you do jujitsu,
great.

3931
03:19:20,970 --> 03:19:24,190
You relaxed walking.
People are scared of vitamin d.

3932
03:19:24,191 --> 03:19:28,680
The society scared people have sunlight.
You got to get on with something.

3933
03:19:28,700 --> 03:19:33,310
A little bit of depression because 
depression people talk about again,

3934
03:19:33,520 --> 03:19:35,080
you know,
I many times I had to be depressed.

3935
03:19:35,160 --> 03:19:38,110
You know how many times I've had 
opportunities to call you up and go,

3936
03:19:38,650 --> 03:19:39,490
I'm depressed.

3937
03:19:39,520 --> 03:19:41,780
I get depressed for 10 fucking minutes.
Right?

3938
03:19:41,920 --> 03:19:46,920
Then I smoked the solutes and expired 
fucking chiba chew or I think of 

3939
03:19:46,920 --> 03:19:48,850
something that you said and I left my 
fucking ass off.

3940
03:19:49,540 --> 03:19:54,540
You know,
on the way up here I was high as fuck 

3941
03:19:54,540 --> 03:19:57,240
and they used to be.
This guy that used to fuck with me at a 

3942
03:19:57,240 --> 03:19:57,480
body shop was a detailer.
Used to fuck with me every day.

3943
03:19:57,910 --> 03:19:59,980
Couldn't beat him up.
He's a lot bigger than I would,

3944
03:20:00,550 --> 03:20:02,980
so how to use my mind.
So I saw a dead mouse one day.

3945
03:20:03,970 --> 03:20:08,970
I took him out of his jacket pocket.
He was driving to work one morning and 

3946
03:20:08,970 --> 03:20:13,111
he went in his pocket for a cigarette 
and he found the mouth and he crashed 

3947
03:20:13,111 --> 03:20:13,111
his car.

3948
03:20:16,180 --> 03:20:20,330
Oh joey,
we're at almost four hours.

3949
03:20:20,331 --> 03:20:21,670
All right,
let's get the fuck out of here.

3950
03:20:23,050 --> 03:20:24,320
Get the fuck out of there.
I love you.

3951
03:20:24,350 --> 03:20:27,680
Thank you very much for having me.
A vegas.

3952
03:20:28,370 --> 03:20:31,250
Utah's sold that.
I'm in Kansas city with you.

3953
03:20:31,520 --> 03:20:33,310
I'm at the improv.
Why urine?

3954
03:20:33,480 --> 03:20:36,380
Oh,
doing the theater Like gentlemen.

3955
03:20:36,440 --> 03:20:39,860
And then I'm in nashville in huntsville,
Alabama at the end of the year.

3956
03:20:40,130 --> 03:20:42,530
But besides that I'm home.
It was a pleasure seeing you.

3957
03:20:42,531 --> 03:20:43,640
Look great.
I love you brother.

3958
03:20:43,641 --> 03:20:45,500
We'll take your off for up and we'll 
train them.

3959
03:20:45,501 --> 03:20:48,140
We'll have jamie.
We'll come in,

3960
03:20:48,141 --> 03:20:53,141
we'll do a cycle of dIfferent 
cardiovascular machines and then we'll 

3961
03:20:53,451 --> 03:20:58,451
do a circuit of the cardiovascular 
machines and do a circuit of some 

3962
03:20:58,451 --> 03:20:58,850
kettlebell exercises.
Would do.

3963
03:20:58,880 --> 03:21:00,910
Can you do chin ups?
Chin ups at all?

3964
03:21:00,920 --> 03:21:02,120
How's your shoulder?
Terrible.

3965
03:21:02,180 --> 03:21:03,020
Terrible.
Okay.

3966
03:21:03,170 --> 03:21:04,900
Have you ever done clubs?
You've done clubs,

3967
03:21:05,940 --> 03:21:07,240
clubs,

03:21:23,061 --> 03:21:23,780
man.
We could do that.

3976
03:21:23,850 --> 03:21:28,850
What time do you usually get here?
I think you dropped the girls off and 

3977
03:21:28,850 --> 03:21:31,541
then you shoot right over.
A lot of times I come here early and 

3978
03:21:31,541 --> 03:21:33,821
workout,
but sometimes I can't do it until the 

3979
03:21:33,821 --> 03:21:33,821
afternoon,
but we'll work something out.

3980
03:21:33,821 --> 03:21:34,340
We'll do some shit and thank you for the
experience.

3981
03:21:34,420 --> 03:21:36,680
Disneyland.
Jesus fucking christ,

3982
03:21:36,681 --> 03:21:37,490
bro.
It's fun,

3983
03:21:37,491 --> 03:21:41,240
right?
But just the way you told me to do it.

3984
03:21:41,270 --> 03:21:42,620
Like I looked at it.
My wife's like,

3985
03:21:42,621 --> 03:21:43,430

3988
03:21:47,070 --> 03:21:48,680
I invite our brother,
addy.

3989
03:21:48,740 --> 03:21:51,530
We had a great time with the kids heard.
It was awesome.

3990
03:21:51,820 --> 03:21:53,210
It was awesome man.
Thank you brother.

3991
03:21:53,270 --> 03:21:55,610
Thank god for some place like disneyland

3992
03:21:55,611 --> 03:21:56,860

When you didn't have kids,

3993
03:21:57,070 --> 03:21:59,600
who gives a fuck about disneyland,
but when you have kids it's like,

3994
03:21:59,660 --> 03:22:04,660
oh,
taylor stopped me at the gate because 

3995
03:22:04,660 --> 03:22:06,380
they found them that a boy.
He did tell me they fucking let and then

3996
03:22:06,400 --> 03:22:08,360
they ate half of it and the guy goes,
I didn't see you.

3997
03:22:08,361 --> 03:22:11,780
I was naive.
I love you.
