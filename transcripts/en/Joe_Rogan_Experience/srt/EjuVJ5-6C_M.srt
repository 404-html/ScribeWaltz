1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,910
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,650
Have you eaten polar bear?

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,191
Oh,

4
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:05,850
absolutely.

5
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,960
What does polar bread tastes like?

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,880
You know what I've eaten at?

7
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:10,290
It's up in the Arctic with the annual it.

8
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,190
And so they,

9
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,960
they boil everything.

10
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,720
It's a boiled and,

11
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,583
and uh,

12
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,400
it's funny you put salt,

13
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,263
lick the brisket.

14
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,520
It normally where we need the backstraps,

15
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,150
you know,

16
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,290
that'd be the first choice or 10 wines,

17
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,850
the Inuit nod,

18
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,880
it's the brisket because when you boil it,

19
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,090
that's where you've got
this great textures,

20
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:30,301
you know,

21
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,290
that they're crunchy.

22
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,071
Uh,

23
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:32,371
I mean,

24
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:35,730
I don't even know what you'd call
a cartilage and connective tissue.

25
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,260
There's not just meat and fat.

26
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,420
So that's the,

27
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,000
you know,

28
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,391
it was,

29
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:40,141
it was a delicacy.

30
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:43,440
I would rate it right up there with
the best of the meat I've ever had now

31
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:44,010
Healy.

32
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,131
Oh,

33
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:44,964
absolutely.

34
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,270
But boiled with salt and being
very hungry out on the ice.

35
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:48,811
You know,

36
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:51,040
you spent 20 days out in the
ice with annual it on a dog.

37
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,330
Sledger you're hungry.

38
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:52,581
He,

39
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:52,951
you know,

40
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:54,570
they kill a barrier unit near,

41
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,530
it's like the best finest Coby
beef and downtown New York City.

42
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,920
Is it relative to where you're at
and the struggle that your enemy,

43
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:03,300
if you had it in La,

44
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,530
if I took it to a restaurant down the
street and hard to say because there is no

45
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:08,320
restaurant serves it,

46
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,780
so it's hard to,

47
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,080
hard to take it out of
that context and say,

48
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,010
is it the best meat?

49
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,940
Now here,

50
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,020
I don't know.

51
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,040
I mean while cheap,

52
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:17,431
same thing.

53
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:22,110
You're on a mountain and you've been
backpacking for 10 days carrying 50 to 70

54
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:27,090
pounds on your back and you finally get
you around and run down to below Alpine

55
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:30,060
and find some little sticks and make
a fire and roast the ribs on it.

56
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,510
I defy anybody to tell me there's a
better piece of meat in this world that

57
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:39,090
tastes better than that wild sheep
on a mountain after a sheep hunt.

58
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,890
But would it be that good if I was
downtown New York City or here in la?

59
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,301
You know,

60
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:46,131
I don't know because you,

61
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:47,730
you just can't do it.

62
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:48,480
It doesn't exist.

63
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,190
One of the best meals
I've ever had in my life.

64
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:51,450
We shot a mule deer,

65
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,880
that deer right there in Montana.

66
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,020
And uh,

67
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,550
we,

68
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,530
we ate the liver and
the heart of that night.

69
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,610
It was insane.

70
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,530
It was so delicious.

71
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,100
That's the camp fire and just cooked it
over oil with a little salt and pepper.

72
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,250
And we were just moaning
with delight like an orgy.

73
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,590
Anyone that doesn't hunt,

74
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,980
that isn't out there can
never know what we're,

75
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:14,230
what,

76
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,090
what you're describing.

77
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:15,924
I know it.

78
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,793
I know it.

79
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,300
I've had the same thing and I've had,

80
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,571
you know,

81
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,130
Moose liver and name it,

82
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,521
name it,

83
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:21,090
you know,

84
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,070
antelope all around the world.

85
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:23,940
We've had the same thing.

86
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,280
It's the best of the best.

87
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,360
It's the perfect,

88
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,870
I think it's because that's who we are.

89
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,831
That's who we are.

90
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:31,941
We're,

91
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:33,020
we're not the,

92
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,770
the fancy restaurant,

93
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,203
you know,

94
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,250
thousand dollar bottles of wine and whole
whole wait cuisine is not what we are.

95
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,561
We're,

96
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,394
we're just,

97
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,390
we're just that we eat
wild game cooked on a fire.

98
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,831
That's the truth.

99
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:47,311
We can ever be.

100
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:48,210
That's the truest,

101
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,130
most natural flavor and,

102
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,460
and eating that we could ever do.

103
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,271
I don't know,

104
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:54,631
man.

105
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:55,171
I don't know.

106
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,190
It's interesting.

107
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,640
I,

108
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,440
I don't have it gets stuck in your head,

109
00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,650
but I don't know either.

110
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,903
Good.

111
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,411
But it,

112
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:04,210
it seems like a very likely scenario.

113
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,601
I mean,

114
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,140
the,

115
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,920
the brain's functional and it's
the most traumatic experience ever.

116
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,780
And you don't have any context.

117
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,760
Don't have any language.

118
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,570
You don't have any knowledge
of why you're there.

119
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,440
No one's explained what's going to happen.

120
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,610
All of a sudden you're born,

121
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,070
that's gotta be unbelievably traumatic.

122
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:21,950
You've been hearing this,

123
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,150
right?

124
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,983
Oh,

125
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,771
hold on.

126
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,380
Top of that.

127
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,490
Add circumcision.

128
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,240
And how about the apple?

129
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,290
Slice your fucking Dick with a razor.

130
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,760
Welcome home.

131
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,820
Why you cut his dick?

132
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,480
Wyatt,

133
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,231
welcome to Earth.

134
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:38,820
We're just going to let the kid be clean.

135
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,840
What about soap?

136
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,043
Anybody ever?

137
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,720
Everybody we're talking about
soap to cut his fucking Dick.

138
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,290
Wow.

139
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,051
Hit screamings.

140
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:49,950
Dick's on fire.

141
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,421
Screaming.

142
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:52,310
Just came out of a pussy.

143
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,400
Dixon actually,

144
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:54,890
how long do they wait
for the circumstances?

145
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:55,830
They probably don't do it right away,

146
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,960
but they definitely stick
you with needles right away.

147
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,790
They vaccinate you like instantly.

148
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,050
We're worried about disease.

149
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,990
Fucking shove needles right
into that baby's body.

150
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,460
Start pumping chemicals.

151
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,900
Do you ever do a home birth?

152
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,190
Fuck No.

153
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,660
What am I living in a cave.

154
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,100
What am I on a fucking farm somewhere
and a Clint Eastwood movie about the 18

155
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:16,230
hundreds to fuck out of here.

156
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,361
Sally.

157
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:19,500
I don't think she's going to make it.

158
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,080
Try your hardest.

159
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,260
That's how the whole damn blue rosary,

160
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,210
every western birth movie,

161
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:28,050
it's like they act.

162
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:29,850
If you get the water bucket there in time,

163
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:30,990
that baby will survive.

164
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,540
It fixed me a bucket of water.

165
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,623
Yeah.

166
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,670
Fucking a water.

167
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,770
Went some cloths and clean clauses.

168
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,673
Walter,

169
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,260
what is the bucket of water?

170
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:40,691
Dh?

171
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:41,940
It like baby's turned around.

172
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:42,760
I'm gonna have to go in there.

173
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,251
He goes anywhere.

174
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:44,760
It's farmer hands and ruins.

175
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:49,761
Your wife's pussy shoves his gigantic
gorilla like farmer hands into that pussy

176
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,900
and spins it around.

177
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,930
He's the only guy knows how to do
it cause he's done it with calves.

178
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,280
We've got a breach crab.

179
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:56,880
Alrighty.

180
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,400
Rolls his sleeves up to his
elbow and just fucking lubes.

181
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:00,234
The whole thing,

182
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,130
just launches it in there and spins around
your kid fingernails just under half.

183
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,090
Good fucking country doctor.

184
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,330
Just fucking go for shit.

185
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,730
Monkey bullshit.

186
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,130
He wiped his ass with his
fingernails better 12th every yet.

187
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:22,030
It just took a giant farmer,

188
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,570
doctor crap and your in your,

189
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:29,520
in your outhouse and he's reaching into
your wife's Plessy and out gotta have

190
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:33,150
strangled the [inaudible]
mountain nurse baby.

191
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,250
And then he'd do a
smack it to make it cry.

192
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,413
Yeah.

193
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,051
And the poor thing,

194
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:37,620
it's just like,

195
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,700
what happened?

196
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:39,850
What happened?

197
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,590
Why?

198
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,020
And that's what pushed us to
go out and look at this like,

199
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,790
so we,

200
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,990
we went to the West Bank and hung
out with this comedy satire troop.

201
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,650
Whoa.

202
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,180
Who has a television show that it's,

203
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,180
it's once a week,

204
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:57,090
but during Ramadan it's
every single night for 30.

205
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,810
And so,

206
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,893
whoa.

207
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,640
Um,

208
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:01,971
yeah.

209
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:03,440
And so like we hung out with these folks,

210
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:03,620
like,

211
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,370
so these are people who are there
living in the West Bank and they're

212
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:08,840
criticizing everyone.

213
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,940
So they're criticizing the Palestinians,

214
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:11,510
Israel,

215
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,280
the Israelis,

216
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,580
the Americans,

217
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,043
Brock,

218
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,213
um,

219
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:16,850
wow.

220
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,240
Uh,

221
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,481
you know,

222
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,630
like Oh,

223
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:20,990
Sama and Obama in the same sketch,

224
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:21,201
right?

225
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:21,461
Like the,

226
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:21,650
you know,

227
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,480
these guys are doing really cutting
edge stuff in this place that there,

228
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,910
there aren't comedy clubs like your,

229
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,640
the way that you get professional comedy,

230
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,240
there's like two shows on Palestinian
national television or you need to find it

231
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,110
broadcast from Egypt or from
Jordan or I'm not sure Jordan,

232
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,940
because evidently the Jordans
aren't terribly funny.

233
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,080
Jordanis aren't very funny.

234
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:47,060
But the Egyptians are like rural areas,

235
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,590
Jordanians or funny,

236
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,030
that Guy Right now listening.

237
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:50,870
It's fucking pissed.

238
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,850
There is a no,

239
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,510
we talked to these guys and they're like,

240
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:53,781
oh yeah,

241
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:54,490
there's a,

242
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,130
um,

243
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,130
there's like a hierarchy of comedy in
the Middle East and according to them the

244
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,330
Palestinians are about the middle.

245
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,410
The Egyptians are hilarious really.

246
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:11,411
And the Jordanians evidently are
like the most serious or Hawaii.

247
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,800
They're very funny.

248
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,250
Yes.

249
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,270
What do you attribute that to?

250
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,060
I can't remember.

251
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,983
I don't know.

252
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,411
Uh,

253
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:18,681
I was,

254
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:19,281
Joel was here.

255
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:20,330
He remembers everything.

256
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,920
He cause he writes it all down.

257
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,510
But uh,

258
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,661
yeah,

259
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:24,890
there's like a long history of,

260
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,301
uh,

261
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:25,880
of,

262
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,340
of Egyptian comedy.

263
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,330
Ha.

264
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,320
Very funny people.

265
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,220
What about,

266
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,730
uh,

267
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,950
the Israelis do they factor in there?

268
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,281
Yeah.

269
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:34,640
So,

270
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,580
so what was really fascinating was that,

271
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:38,481
um,

272
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:38,900
so we,

273
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,081
you know,

274
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:41,120
you have kind of the stereotype of the,

275
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,013
of the,

276
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,820
the funny Jewish person,

277
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,181
right?

278
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:45,750
Very self deprecating.

279
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,790
Um,

280
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,780
but you don't find that style
of comedy in Israel as much.

281
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,363
The Israeli,

282
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,410
um,

283
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,130
comedy is a lot more aggressive.

284
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:55,964
Like it's the,

285
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,880
it's the comedy of the victor not of the,

286
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,350
of the victim.

287
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,221
Oh.

288
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:01,480
How's,

289
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,020
and so we found this weird reversal where
the Palestinians were much more sort

290
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:11,021
of self deprecating and their
comedy was much more Jewish in,

291
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,860
in the American sense than you
would have necessarily expected.

292
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,320
So it was really,

293
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:18,350
I was really fascinating.

294
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:28,430
Okay.
