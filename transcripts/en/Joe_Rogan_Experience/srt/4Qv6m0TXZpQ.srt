00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,610
Now you,

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,230
but you've also been real open about
steroids in which I think is very

4
00:00:08,231 --> 00:00:11,680
commendable because it's one of those
things in the world of power lifting the

5
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:13,960
world of bodybuilding and
even in the world of fighting,

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,310
it's a dirty,

7
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:18,460
dark secret that people
like to keep to themselves.

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,840
But your grandpa can take it.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,250
Yeah,

10
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:21,551
yeah.

11
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:21,940
Right.

12
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,710
Yeah.

13
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,050
I,

14
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:23,950
I believe in my,

15
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:24,790
in my opinion,

16
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,481
there should be,

17
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:26,620
you should pass the physical.

18
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,080
No one has the right to tell
you what to do in this world.

19
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:29,560
One,

20
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,400
when it comes time to die on the one
that's got a die so much time for me to

21
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:33,641
live,

22
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:35,170
let me lead the life I want to live.

23
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,060
But what do you think in terms of the,

24
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,240
the problem with a lot of
people have the problem,

25
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,640
the problem they see with using steroids
in sports is it's going to force young

26
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:49,520
people to use steroids to be able to
compete with the people that are using

27
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:50,000
them.

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,130
Hey,

29
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,331
good.

30
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:51,164
Anyhow.

31
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,093
Yeah.

32
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,670
But if everybody's forced to be cleaned
and they don't like what we're doing now

33
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:56,361
with the UFC,

34
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:57,770
you were like the Usada,

35
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:58,360
the,

36
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:58,560
the,

37
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,660
the people that have stepped in,

38
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,370
Jeff Novitsky running that program,

39
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:03,320
the guy who caught Lance Armstrong,

40
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:04,540
well,

41
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,310
actually Lance Armstrong was never caught,

42
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:06,600
right.

43
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:06,980
Hey Pat,

44
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,570
right.

45
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,080
He passed 25 tests for seven years
in a row and never was tested.

46
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:11,501
See,

47
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,060
it's not against the rules to take drugs.

48
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,640
It's against the rules and
get caught taking drugs.

49
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,263
Um,

50
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,150
that's a fucking loophole.

51
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,160
You've got a good doctor.

52
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,270
You're on the craft,

53
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:22,631
but not,

54
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:23,290
not.

55
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,590
So that's why there should be no,

56
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:25,120
do you know,

57
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,580
uh,

58
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,330
tie should period said make
it an even playing field.

59
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,470
Stopped the drug test.

60
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:32,710
I'd say the same thing and we're not
all born was seeing my testosterone.

61
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,370
That's true.

62
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:33,641
I mean,

63
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:34,474
when I was a kid,

64
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,580
if I was born today,

65
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:37,600
I would be in prison.

66
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,910
You're not telling me I teach all these,

67
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:41,140
you know,

68
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,790
some of those fighters have
got way more testosterone.

69
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,910
Did another fighter that's true.

70
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,360
Not born.

71
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,193
Same amount.

72
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,410
So the only thing you could,

73
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:48,040
why not for,

74
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,340
you know,

75
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:48,671
train.

76
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:49,504
You've got a better,

77
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,500
if you've got a better,

78
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:50,800
uh,

79
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,400
you know you could kick my ass because
you do Jujitsu and shit and I don't do

80
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:54,880
any,

81
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,200
but that don't mean
you're tougher than me.

82
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,970
I just mean you had a better coach in me.

83
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,710
So are you cheating me?

84
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,233
That's a good point.

85
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,560
But if two guys do have the same coaches
and they do have similar body types,

86
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,040
and one guy's taking steroids,

87
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,390
he's going to have an advantage,

88
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:10,710
right?

89
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,450
But isn't it pharmaceutical?

90
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,020
What are you looking at your watch
TV every five minutes you got a drug

91
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:16,854
commercial one,

92
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,130
right?

93
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,130
Every year I'll be 69
and let's take all the,

94
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:20,370
God,

95
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,370
I'm 68 I'll be 600 to almost take all
the health medication of 68 year old.

96
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,760
I'd be the only one left on her.

97
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,140
I don't have any ailment.

98
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,620
Common will tell you my problem is they
go to the doctor does note that Romy,

99
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:32,454
there's nothing wrong with me.

100
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,830
I had to beat the crap
out of myself physically.

101
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,200
I don't have high blood
pressure and cholesterol,

102
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,700
I don't have anything.

103
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,100
And so let's just take all the drugs away.

104
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,560
But all the old 68 year old
guys die off as permanent.

105
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,581
Well,

106
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,190
it'd be the only one lip for garlic.

107
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,033
All the old women.

108
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,133
Yeah.

109
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,860
Well for a guy like you
who's not competing and Z,

110
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,800
one of the arguments for fighting is
that steroids allow you to do more damage

111
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:58,634
to your opponent.

112
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,210
And that is one of the reasons why,

113
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,451
uh,

114
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:04,900
steroids should be illegal is
because you can train harder,

115
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,700
you have more endurance
and not just steroids,

116
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,040
but things like EPO and
bunch of other stuff.

117
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,590
You'll have more energy in a fight.

118
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,490
You could possibly land more blows,

119
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,200
possibly wind up beating someone that you
wouldn't be able to beat and do damage

120
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:17,501
to them.

121
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,180
So it's different in a lot of ways.

122
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,310
Or why,

123
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,230
why wouldn't person take us force for him?

124
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,680
You know,

125
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,530
it's called PE,

126
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,830
these performance enhancing drugs.

127
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,540
Why wouldn't you do that in sport?

128
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,510
Well,

129
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,900
it's because they would
think of it as cheating.

130
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,171
Well,

131
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:32,004
who does?

132
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,581
Well,

133
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:35,310
a lot of people don't know how
many guys are cry their eyes out,

134
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:36,144
but you get caught.

135
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,380
Then it cried like bitches.

136
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:38,214
And they lie.

137
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:38,700
Right?

138
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,570
Baseball players,

139
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,171
they don't,

140
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:40,951
they never took drugs.

141
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:42,450
You get caught in a cry like bitches.

142
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:42,780
Right.

143
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,650
That's what I don't like.

144
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:44,460
Just tell him.

145
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:44,760
You know,

146
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,361
I'll tell you,

147
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:46,440
I'll never read the Bible,

148
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,750
but I see the billboards
on the freeway says,

149
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:49,800
I shall not lie.

150
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,340
Just quit line and come out and say,

151
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:54,180
I take droids,

152
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,601
you know,

153
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,434
the NFL.

154
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,970
Why would you be on as
far as like the NFL,

155
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,770
you know what drugs do is for recovery.

156
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,970
That's all it is.

157
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,200
Right?

158
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,600
You know,

159
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:00,991
you take,

160
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,690
I can give my strongest
people I've ever seen,

161
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,250
uh,

162
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:04,580
doing,

163
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:04,770
uh,

164
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,710
I've seen we'd guys take more drugs
than anyone I've ever had my gym.

165
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,930
Really?

166
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:09,660
Yeah.

167
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,830
Jugs don't make you strong.

168
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,300
You're born that way.

169
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:13,111
You're born fast.

170
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:13,980
You're born slow.

171
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,840
You're born with an attitude.

172
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,030
I know you're not well,

173
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:20,040
that's the big misconception
about steroids,

174
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:20,310
right?

175
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,690
Is that they make you bigger.

176
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,040
The work makes you bigger,

177
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,130
is to recovery,

178
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,570
right.

179
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,890
Cause you to recover.

180
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,400
To do more workouts so everyone
doesn't want to do workouts.

181
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,020
Did the people you know,

182
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,700
say they want to be an MMA fighter,

183
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,151
intimidate,

184
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,350
get in a cage one time?

185
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,520
They never get,

186
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,360
but Coleman told me,

187
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:39,450
mark said he had a million restaurants
when he had hammer house here.

188
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,920
Soon as they got our bar one time,

189
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:41,910
but he never came back.

190
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,333
Yeah.

191
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,833
But there's,

192
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,430
there's a mile benefit
to taking testosterone,

193
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:49,950
a bunch of other stuff without
doing any physical work.

194
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:52,730
But almost all of it is in the fact
that you could put in more work or

195
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,220
work and you recover far
quicker than the average person.

196
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,241
Yeah.

197
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:57,770
But see that way if everyone took it,

198
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,693
you're not cheating.

199
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,330
You know,

200
00:04:59,330 --> 00:04:59,780
you don't,

201
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,613
you gotta you got,

202
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,663
you got a corvette,

203
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,400
you don't have to put high test cas in.

204
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,620
All right.

205
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,610
But don't you think that like it also,

206
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:08,480
but for young guys,

207
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:11,420
he can fuck up your endocrine system
and fucks up your body's production

208
00:05:11,421 --> 00:05:12,290
testosterone.

209
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,753
So what?

210
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,850
So that's what hcg sport,

211
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,890
you got to spark donkey.

212
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,430
Take Ha.

213
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,490
Everybody takes ACG cause your nuxle
streak up because if you take roids you

214
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:23,031
take tests,

215
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,910
you're taking more than mother nature
told you so you're not shrink up.

216
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,390
But there are morons anyhow because
you took Casey cheat your nuts wouldn't

217
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:31,310
drink up hcg.

218
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,091
What does that stand for?

219
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:32,930
Any trophic hormone?

220
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,550
It raises all your home meant
vendors and sports there you cannot,

221
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:39,740
there's no sportsmanship and sports.

222
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,830
It mean you was to fight
in front of a big crowd.

223
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,500
Half the crowd would want me to knock
you out and the other half the crowd,

224
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,570
we want you to knock me out.

225
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:48,470
Does that sportsmanship?

226
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,200
Well that's just people.

227
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,890
I mean but,

228
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,370
but that sportsmanship is supposed
to be the athletes competing without

229
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:56,090
cheating.

230
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,610
I mean if I,

231
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,350
if,

232
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,100
if there was a pill

233
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,840
that you can take that
made you invulnerable,

234
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,990
gave you like a God pill and you took
and you went into a fight and the other

235
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,160
guy thought he was fighting a man,

236
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:04,610
but you're,

237
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,700
you're invulnerable,

238
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,573
no one can hurt you.

239
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,430
You can't be hurt and you don't
get tired of superhuman strength,

240
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,010
which show Roy still be
legal or illegal point.

241
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:13,910
Well,

242
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,440
it would be better than steroids.

243
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,390
It would be like a superstar.

244
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:18,081
Roid but I mean,

245
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:19,580
wouldn't you think that
that would be cheating?

246
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,300
No,

247
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,930
no,

248
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,350
no,

249
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,820
but we'll then nobody can beat old buddy.

250
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,640
You just beat the fuck out of each other
and nothing would ever happen to hills

251
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,450
right here.

252
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,680
It all starts up in your brain,

253
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,521
man.

254
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:28,731
See,

255
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:32,600
I kind of could see how you can make
that argument with other sports.

256
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,590
But with fighting,

257
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,960
I mean fighting is about,

258
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,830
is fighting is problem solving
with dire physical consequences.

259
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,790
I mean that's what it is.

260
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,660
And if you can minimize those
consequences through drugs,

261
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,760
a lot of people would think
that that would be cheating.

262
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,650
I look at like this,

263
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:49,970
I look at the Diaz brothers.

264
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,790
I'm guessing they got
a lot of testosterone.

265
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,650
I don't know who in
the hell their dad was,

266
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,170
but he must had a lot of tests.

267
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,750
Testosterone.

268
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:56,931
Well,

269
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,501
it's interesting.

270
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,080
Those guys eat Vegan and
for the most part thing,

271
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,300
Nate eats fish and eggs too.

272
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,350
I don't even know if Nikki,

273
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:05,600
it's fish he might have in the past,

274
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:06,620
but I don't think he does anymore.

275
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:07,880
I think he's pretty much Vegan,

276
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,090
which most people that eat vegan have
lower testosterone because the substrate

277
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,880
for developing testosterone is fats is
like a cholesterol and fats and one of

278
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:20,324
the most important,

279
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,490
it's like when people
get on ketogenic diets.

280
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:25,340
One of the more interesting things that
happens when they consume a large amount

281
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:29,510
of fats and saturated fats and cholesterol
is that their testosterone goes way

282
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:30,344
up.

283
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,990
I should wait and that you're
going high cholesterol diet.

284
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,920
Yes.

285
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,670
So I don't,

286
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,070
I don't necessarily know if those
guys have high testosterone.

287
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:38,720
What they do have is high endurance.

288
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:39,980
Their endurance is through the roof.

289
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,220
Right.

290
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,710
But a lot of that is because
they participate in triathlons,

291
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:44,570
a lot of endurance running
and during swimming,

292
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,860
biking things on those lines.

293
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,500
So you still have to have,

294
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:48,780
uh,

295
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,280
the,

296
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,930
the,

297
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,890
the brain thought to
go kick someone's ass.

298
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,490
Right.

299
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,010
But don't tell you think that Ronda
Rousey has that brain thought to.

300
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,240
She doesn't have any testosterone.

301
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,461
Well,

302
00:07:56,461 --> 00:07:56,630
I mean,

303
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,980
she has some but not a lot.

304
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,521
You know what I mean?

305
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,600
But more than other girls.

306
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,201
Yeah,

307
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:01,580
but not more than fine work.

308
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,200
Well that's a little different.

309
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,810
See that's the argument
for steroids right there.

310
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,510
That's the argument because
she actually has been caught,

311
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,050
but she's actually tested positive
and then she's passing a test now,

312
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:12,884
right?

313
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,551
Yes.

314
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:18,290
But you know as well as I do that when
a woman takes male hormones for a long

315
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,130
period of time,

316
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,930
even if they get off of them,

317
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,180
there's benefits that they keep forever.

318
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,470
Same thing with men.

319
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,400
Yes.

320
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,050
And just because you're
passing the drug test,

321
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,310
I won't say who,

322
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,770
but I trained the top
international shot putter.

323
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,440
He could golf off hand YPAR in
eight days and pass a drug test.

324
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:34,350
IOC said,

325
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:35,060
I will say,

326
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,893
see that's it's,

327
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,290
it's only eight days you can get on.

328
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:37,850
Oh Nana.

329
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,020
Is the antivirus one of the
quickest ones to get off,

330
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,190
right?

331
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:40,730
Yeah.

332
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,550
So I mean,

333
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,300
and I mean how I forget to
take stuff for eight days.

334
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,230
So the benefits unquestionably a are
permanent or at least some of them are.

335
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,130
What I think about,

336
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:52,431
you know,

337
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,211
what you're looking at.

338
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:56,280
You're looking at a fight career
as you see it in an envelope.

339
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,140
And then when that day
that tough fire retires,

340
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,043
you forget about them.

341
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,250
But what about the years later
after a fighter's career,

342
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,170
if he was on antibiotics,

343
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,610
he would survive the fighting years and
be able to continue with his older years

344
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:09,444
like me.

345
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,510
So what you're saying is that listening?

346
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,060
Well,

347
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,950
longevity post career.

348
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,160
I totally understand that.

349
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:18,590
And a lot of fighters
believe that as well.

350
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,970
Like testosterone replacement,

351
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:23,240
growth hormone therapy
for guys who have retired.

352
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,280
But while they're competing themselves,

353
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,950
they don't want to do anything because
they don't want to think that the reason

354
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,090
why they accomplish those goals,

355
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:30,290
because they were taking drugs.

356
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,240
I could shoot tons of Roy's and someone's
ass ain't going make them kick my ass.

357
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,370
It's not going to make
them kick their ass.

358
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:41,030
But there's no question that some
fighters fight better when they're taking

359
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:41,820
steroids.

360
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,970
How about just a nutritionist?

361
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,680
I was just cut out the nutritionist.

362
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:46,941
Yeah,

363
00:09:46,941 --> 00:09:48,320
but the nutritionist look,

364
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:48,560
look,

365
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,060
everybody knows how to eat healthy.

366
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:50,811
I mean,

367
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:53,000
if you're eating healthy
and you're training hard,

368
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,490
but one guy's taking
steroids and one guy's not,

369
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:57,830
there's a giant advantage for
the guy was taking steroids.

370
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,700
I just know too many people
take steroids in any passenger.

371
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,210
I guess that's all I'm trying to say.

372
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,601
Right.

373
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,740
Well that bring up any names.

374
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,480
I understand and I know you're not,

375
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:09,710
but that's one of the reasons why the
UFC has instituted this incredibly

376
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:10,580
invasive.

377
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,030
You sought a policy where they don't
wake you up at six 30 in the morning.

378
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,430
Well l how'd you like that
watch you piss in a cup.

379
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,990
I don't like it exactly,

380
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,390
but that's the only way to catch people.

381
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,283
Well,

382
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,320
I just,

383
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,680
I mean,

384
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,980
I'll never go to drug test.

385
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,910
I don't think the NFL,

386
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:25,601
she had drug test.

387
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:26,490
I don't think in India.

388
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,360
There's a good argument there,

389
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:28,960
you know?

390
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,441
First of all,

391
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:31,240
it's a good argument for
baseball because baseball,

392
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:33,280
no one's getting hurt in the NFL.

393
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,700
You can make the argument that you're
able to hurt guys more and then that

394
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:38,770
damages them and it shortens their career.

395
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,520
But,

396
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,181
but baseball,

397
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:40,871
there's no argument,

398
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:41,500
in my opinion,

399
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,820
baseball's boring as fuck.

400
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,530
And if,

401
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,320
if,

402
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,370
I mean some people like it,

403
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:46,000
I get it.

404
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,560
But what I'm saying is like if,

405
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,210
if you,

406
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,010
if you got a drug that lets you
hit more balls over the fence,

407
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,053
take that.

408
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,400
That's the only thing interesting
about baseballs home runs.

409
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,470
So how do you let that
for get away with it?

410
00:10:58,471 --> 00:10:59,161
You know what I'm saying?

411
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:00,570
Why not make it legal for all?

412
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,021
You know,

413
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:02,580
like baseball's a funny thing.

414
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:02,970
You know,

415
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,290
if he hit less than 50 home runs,

416
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,071
that gets your drug free,

417
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:08,790
but you start hitting 51 your Roy dry
and seems like that's what this called.

418
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,810
And he talked about the base,

419
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,713
the steroid year.

420
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,020
[inaudible] we're taking a drug in 1960.

421
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,700
So who are they trying to kid where they,

422
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,340
yeah,

423
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,020
it's Saint Louis,

424
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,321
you know,

425
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:16,550
uh,

426
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,700
as a football team,

427
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,360
um,

428
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,541
you know,

429
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,374
the Raiders,

430
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:19,660
uh,

431
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,380
I've heard stories where I
think it's a document on ESPN.

432
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,560
Never gone and had the ball
tabs on the training table.

433
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,340
All right.

434
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,340
Well you know what I just
say to the Raiders or the
baseball team that the oral,

435
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,680
the um,

436
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,350
the A's,

437
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,183
the athletics.

438
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,423
What was like,

439
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,610
if they're in the same town,

440
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,450
it's like Siamese twins.

441
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:39,990
You're having sex with
one girl's room section.

442
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:40,824
Both the girls.

443
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,443
What

444
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,550
if no one tested it?

445
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,270
New football players were taking it.

446
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,500
Okay.

447
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,050
And uh,

448
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,550
Oakland but why was,

449
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,030
why wouldn't the baseball player,

450
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,670
you taken it right down the street.

451
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,970
Clearly it probably would,

452
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,210
but do you think that people were
thinking of steroids is being like,

453
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,690
uh,

454
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,150
like that kind of power being
a crucial aspect of baseball?

455
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,150
I think what it was.

456
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,810
Sure.

457
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,170
But baseball is more of a skill game.

458
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,320
Did anyone ever from Mickey Mantle,

459
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,280
Roger Maris,

460
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,413
Hank Aaron,

461
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,710
do you think Hank Aaron
was doing steroids course?

462
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,390
They had steroids back then.

463
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,680
Pants,

464
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,880
shirts 1939.

465
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,450
But where Pete were athletes
taking them know exactly.

466
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,171
Yes.

467
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,190
That's what I'm trying to say.

468
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:20,510
Okay.

469
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,990
If the football team was taking it,

470
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,100
why wouldn't the baseball,

471
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,110
so we'll get these fortunate answers.

472
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:25,561
All geeks.

473
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:25,920
Anyhow,

474
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,570
there was a god damn thing in her life.

475
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,590
But there they're also a hypocritical
and they got these ideas and their puppy

476
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:33,120
on air probably taking a,

477
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:33,851
you know,

478
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:34,110
um,

479
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,970
testosterone therapy as it is.

480
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,081
How's that?

481
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:40,800
Apparently one time and his doctors are
big fat guy and he's talking about how

482
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,420
bad boy jar sub does listen to them.

483
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,411
And then when,

484
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:43,831
for instance,

485
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:44,760
what's a patch on here?

486
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,091
He's all,

487
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:46,200
that's a testosterone patch.

488
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,413
Huh?

489
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,350
What kind of thinking is that?

490
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,740
I mean it's very,

491
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,593
it's a true story.

492
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,750
Well there's a lot of hypocritical you
when it comes to that stuff for sure.

493
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:56,490
It's just,

494
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:56,761
it's,

495
00:12:56,761 --> 00:13:00,280
it's an interesting debate and a lot of
people think that you should be able to

496
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:01,120
do whatever you want.

497
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:04,330
Like the pride days during the pride days,

498
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,290
which in my opinion,

499
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:09,550
where some of the most exciting
all time mixed martial arts fights,

500
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,680
those guys did whatever
the fuck they wanted.

501
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:16,681
And the Japanese literally told them like
in their contract we will not test you

502
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:17,530
for steroids.

503
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,570
They told them that like,

504
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,530
look at horse racing.

505
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,543
Yeah.

506
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:21,910
Right.

507
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,810
Dog Racing.

508
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,620
Yeah.

509
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,341
But everybody,

510
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:24,920
that's okay.

511
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,320
So he just were worried about that.

512
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:26,640
Well,

513
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,910
equal poise right.

514
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,370
Echo.

515
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,520
Poises aqua.

516
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,780
It's like got a horse
in the fucking title.

517
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,321
Yeah.

518
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:32,730
I mean,

519
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,040
and that's something that people
take and it's a hormone for steroids.

520
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:36,940
For horses.

521
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,774
Exactly.

522
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,733
Now,

523
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,190
so you don't think
there's anything negative.

524
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,460
There's obviously gotta be
some drawbacks of steroids.

525
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:46,294
Right.

526
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,710
I went on antibiotics in 19 January,

527
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,170
1970 1970 1970 and uh,

528
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,750
so it was this 2016.

529
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,350
Yeah,

530
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,183
I'd never been off.

531
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,940
You never been off in 46 years.

532
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,230
That's insane.

533
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,890
It just stay on him.

534
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,580
That's right.

535
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,960
No cycle that go off

536
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,040
to tell everybody or off him.

537
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,193
Exactly.

538
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,060
I go out there and tell him the truth.

539
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,040
I don't lie to people get upset.

540
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,420
Are you that you're so honest about it?

541
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,860
I don't give a damn of the upset,

542
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,330
but I'm just curious and you'll never
come up at the council self-respecting.

543
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,290
I give him hell about these geeks.

544
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,520
They're not doing crap.

545
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,170
They suck when they were kids.

546
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:29,390
They suck when you're at middle
age and they suck when you're old.

547
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,920
That's how I look at it.

548
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,181
Our Damn prison.

549
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:38,901
I'll be on roids.

550
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:39,640
I'll count you bev.

551
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:39,831
Roy,

552
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:40,491
you wouldn't be putting,

553
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:41,750
our world would be in its shape.

554
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:42,584
It's in the day.

555
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,000
If they had some nuts,

556
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,390
but if they had nuts,

557
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:47,380
they wouldn't need steroids.

558
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:47,621
Right.

559
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:48,454
Cause then

560
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,093
let's just say some,

561
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,160
right.

562
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,810
Some aggression.

563
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,290
Yeah.

564
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,250
So my premise is a psychologist and
he would test people in prisons,

565
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,700
a rapist hammers.

566
00:14:58,701 --> 00:14:59,860
He said he had tested some,

567
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,090
had 25 times the rate testosterone
and normal man does 25 one time.

568
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,300
That's why I say,

569
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:07,961
you know,

570
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:09,040
it wasn't even possible.

571
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,990
Well why are they out there raping people
and why they killing people with no,

572
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,080
no remorse.

573
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,990
Because he got an enormous amount.

574
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,650
He said that he saw it.

575
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:18,760
That's why they probably did it.

576
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,683
He didn't,

577
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,140
um,

578
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,973
you know,

579
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,630
if you can't do that stuff,

580
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:23,231
he realized that.

581
00:15:23,231 --> 00:15:26,200
But he thought that's why they would
be on a course to do stuff like that.

582
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,520
It just absolutely crazy.

583
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,480
You take,

584
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,201
look at elephants,

585
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:30,970
you dug these elephants while they call,

586
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:31,720
when they,

587
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,590
they just ease.

588
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:33,550
I'll test house in or out,

589
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:35,110
killing each other and knock it down.

590
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:35,944
Villagers.

591
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,550
So the world needs more of that.

592
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,161
Well,

593
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:40,350
I think it needs more because
of the kind of look at,

594
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,430
you know what?

595
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,270
When I was a kid,

596
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:43,230
just 10% gay.

597
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,180
Now they say there's 34

598
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,990
four 34% 4% but colleges,

599
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,740
I believe it too,

600
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,280
me,

601
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,113
boy bands,

602
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,160
there's no ways.

603
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,940
34% 4% oh man.

604
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,420
Okay,

605
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,440
well I'm sure someone probably
want to test out your,

606
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,490
because look at Jeffrey Dahmer.

607
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,350
He's out there killing people.

608
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:04,911
Well,

609
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:05,744
he was gay too,

610
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,843
but I don't think,

611
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,040
I don't necessarily think
that's a testosterone thing.

612
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:10,281
Right?

613
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:12,280
That's a sociopath psychopath thing.

614
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,130
Who knows?

615
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:13,963
I will say that.

616
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:14,240
Well,

617
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,930
I don't think,

618
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,763
well,

619
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,210
I'm not talking about the gay part,

620
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,320
the other part of the
eating people crazy ash.

621
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,673
I mean,

622
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,701
but that's,

623
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:25,910
but that's not a good
argument for testosterone if
you seen that prisoners and

624
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:27,680
rapists and murderers have a lot of it,

625
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:28,330
so,

626
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,100
but it got a lot of opinions about Roy's,

627
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:33,160
but I've seen probably a thousand
people on Roy's over the years.

628
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,640
Right,

629
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,010
okay.

630
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,721
Dell maybe more,

631
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:34,961
right?

632
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:35,560
That's right.

633
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,620
The ones who took the most drugs
were not always the strongest.

634
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,370
I can see the strong guys didn't
take that much and a lot of them.

635
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,650
And then the lesser
guys take a ton of shit,

636
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:45,440
but he just can't do it.

637
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,680
Nothing.

638
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,740
They're just not what strong.

639
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,311
Well,

640
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:51,540
isn't there also a point of diminishing
returns where like taking too much of it

641
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,290
throws your body out of balance to the
point where you're not going to recover

642
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,810
correctly.

643
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,350
Cause your body's constantly dealing
with this and it makes you crazy.

644
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:58,960
Right.

645
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,820
It can't concentrate.

646
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,451
Yeah.

647
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:00,841
That's a,

648
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:02,880
that's a real problem that
people don't want to admit.

649
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:04,440
The roid rage isn't a real thing.

650
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,061
I've seen it.

651
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:05,551
It's real.

652
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:06,510
It's 100% real.

653
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,070
I don't think there's such a
thing you don't think so know.

654
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,410
Well you said it makes you crazy.

655
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,011
Yeah.

656
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:11,910
But I don't see the little,

657
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:12,840
the little guys,

658
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:13,051
you know,

659
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:16,590
there's plenty of fighters would fight a
300 pound guy cause they're just crazy,

660
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,370
crazy.

661
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:17,611
Right.

662
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:18,444
You know,

663
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,830
enrollees are fucking crazy.

664
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,161
Right.

665
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:24,030
But when people are taking too much
steroids and it makes you crazy,

666
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,320
a little guy's not going to jump
on a big guy and get his ass great.

667
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:27,670
You know,

668
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,710
