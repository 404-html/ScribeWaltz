1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,060
Try My day,

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,720
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,660
which brings us to the fight
that was pulled off this card.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,210
Cain Velasquez versus Fabrizio for doom.

5
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:09,990
The rematch,

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,990
which everybody was looking forward to
and a cane did that meeting with that uh,

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,060
that whatever a association.

8
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:18,421
Yes.

9
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:22,140
The Fighters Association and said that
he's going to have to have a surgery

10
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:22,974
after this fight.

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:23,963
And they went,

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,163
what?

13
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,050
Why don't you step that he fucked up you.

14
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,411
They like,

15
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:31,860
you can't say you need a surgery
before you have a major fight.

16
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,860
First of all that that's going
to fuck with a betting lines.

17
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:38,430
There's a disaster there that's going
to fuck with the insurance if something

18
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:39,181
happens to you.

19
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:40,590
And then afterwards they say,

20
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:40,921
Oh,

21
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:41,221
you know,

22
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:41,551
you,

23
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:43,650
you told us that you are already hurt.

24
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:44,730
We're not paying for this.

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,780
Like do you,

26
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,770
do you get paid,

27
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,550
um,

28
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,930
for like when you're in training camp
and you get to a fight and you have to

29
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:52,860
pull out because the injury,

30
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:53,730
you don't get nothing.

31
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,330
Right.

32
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,163
What do you get?

33
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,370
Uh,

34
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:56,850
nothing.

35
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,241
Nothing.

36
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:58,080
So you got nothing.

37
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,330
So if he chose to fight with that injury,

38
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:03,420
he said he was going to be 100% he's going
to have a cortisone injection and the

39
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:04,370
doctors disagreed.

40
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:06,750
The Nevada State Athletic
Commission disagreed that,

41
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:06,930
uh,

42
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,651
Bob Bennett Guy,

43
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,970
he doesn't fucking playing the games man.

44
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:09,270
He's like,

45
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,020
you can't say something like that.

46
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,260
And then finally long to do that.

47
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:14,040
I fucked up.

48
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,873
He fucked up.

49
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,640
Just emotional when I called
Linacre a little monkey earlier,

50
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,653
I fucked up.

51
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,980
See came fucked up.

52
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:20,670
You just talk,

53
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,503
you say things,

54
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,500
you know,

55
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,041
I was going to say,

56
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,000
well that's kind of racist,

57
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,680
but I call myself a monkey though.

58
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:25,981
I just,

59
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:26,600
it sounds,

60
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,720
it sounds worse than it really is.

61
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,651
It's not racist.

62
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:29,320
It's not race.

63
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,990
I'm the last person racist.

64
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,860
But the point is with when it comes to
Cain is that it was a giant error and

65
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,460
that error pulled him off of this card
and now he's going to have to fight.

66
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,040
He's going to have to get surgery
and then he didn't have to fight.

67
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,330
Whoever the fuck has left and it's,

68
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,350
you're talking about more months out
and then even more examination next time

69
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,060
and it's going to cost
him a shit load of money.

70
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,070
A ton of money went
through the entire camp.

71
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,350
He was a week out and
they pull them from it.

72
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,370
And then he was saying,

73
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:54,300
I don't know what this is about.

74
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:54,531
I'm,

75
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,770
I'm 100% good to go.

76
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,210
I've been told I've been cleared.

77
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,600
So he was tweeting that he had been told
that he was cleared right before they

78
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:01,434
pull them.

79
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,280
I thought you know I think you give the
guy a physical examination in terms of

80
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:05,850
his movement.

81
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,660
Like what can you do?

82
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,170
Like,

83
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:07,710
how do you,

84
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,120
how do you tell the guy business wise,

85
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,081
business wise,

86
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:13,440
you can look in his bag back some since
I added this why slide you kick cause

87
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:14,880
the UFC goes man,

88
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:15,930
you have a bulging disc,

89
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,140
you get the cortisone shot and then if
you get punched in the face by her doing

90
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:20,850
where you get the guilty
and you're paralyzed,

91
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,430
you sue the fuck out us cause
we let your true business,

92
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:24,330
you just can't do that.

93
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,050
No deny.

94
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,370
I don't think it falls on.

95
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,080
Kay came knows better.

96
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,160
The people around this association
shouldn't have let him do that.

97
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,950
Well first of all they should have known
about first the Bjorn revenue thing is

98
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:36,451
very weird.

99
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:39,840
Like I was reading with John Fitch had
written that John Fitch rather than an

100
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:43,950
interview said that he was
very a disturbed by all
this because there's a class

101
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:44,910
action lawsuit.

102
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,940
And what they're saying is that if the
class action lawsuit is dropped like that

103
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,260
they could form this,

104
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:52,471
uh,

105
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:53,460
this union.

106
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,750
And if the all agreed to abandon
the class action lawsuit,

107
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,320
it would,

108
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,550
it would like help the
strength and form the union.

109
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,660
And John Fitch was like,

110
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:02,110
what?

111
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,770
Like,

112
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,120
so you're saying that the UFC would
accept you as a union if you abandoned the

113
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:10,150
class action lawsuit that we've been
chasing down for two years now without

114
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,260
picking any sides.

115
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,330
Like if you're on the
side of the fighters,

116
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,440
not picking any sides,

117
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
you just have to look at that and go,

118
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:20,200
well what benefit would it be for the
people that are not in this to accept that

119
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,730
the class action lawsuit has dropped?

120
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:25,780
This all sounds like someone's trying to
get some money because there's no one's

121
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,614
doing this for free.

122
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,830
That's what everybody has to realize
when it comes to like these agencies and

123
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,710
there's like three different
competing ones that are stepping in,

124
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:32,861
right?

125
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:33,401
One soon.

126
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:33,700
The other,

127
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,521
there's the associate,

128
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:35,261
the two big ones.

129
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:36,120
There's association,

130
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:36,954
there's the Union.

131
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,200
Yeah.

132
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,990
Well ultimately I think we
all want the same thing.

133
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,450
We all want fighters to
be compensated fairly.

134
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:46,150
Want them to make a lot of money because
it's a short window of time and it's an

135
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:47,200
awesome sport to watch,

136
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,830
right?

137
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,663
Correct.

138
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,830
So you got to wonder,

139
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:51,880
does this help that?

140
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,840
Does this help them?

141
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,060
Does it do any of these organizations?

142
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,021
They haven't yet.

143
00:03:56,021 --> 00:04:01,021
Because if they can get
together and organize and
they're gonna fight right then

144
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,200
no one's gonna take you serious.

145
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,220
There's three different leaders,

146
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:04,150
three different ones,

147
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,470
and they all want different things.

148
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:08,050
And then you've got to wonder
whose agenda's over here?

149
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:09,280
Whose agenda's over here?

150
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,540
What it has to come.

151
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,800
It can't come from businessman,

152
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,240
can't come from another promoter.

153
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,100
How's it come from the fighters,

154
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:15,820
the fighters,

155
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,530
you know what I'm saying?

156
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,050
Yeah.

157
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,260
And I'm not saying current fighters
because they need to fight and then they

158
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,300
need to have someone speak
for them who's been there.

159
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,021
But you,

160
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:26,500
you can't have these business guys
with other hidden agendas trying to get

161
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,071
things done.

162
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:27,370
Or,

163
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,960
or in a B,

164
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,591
orange case,

165
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:30,200
he has this,

166
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,910
you know,

167
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,530
weird jealousy with Dana
and what's seem destroyed.

168
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:33,651
Well,

169
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:34,480
we can't have that.

170
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,680
Why are you speaking for us?

171
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,430
What are you doing?

172
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,870
Yeah,

173
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,150
you have,

174
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,100
you don't have the respect of the
is what the fuck you're doing.

175
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,130
And notice he's taking a
seat back because everyone,

176
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:43,380
when everyone saw him speaking,

177
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:43,721
they were like,

178
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:44,070
we're out,

179
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,570
man.

180
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:44,861
Yeah.

181
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:45,041
Well,

182
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:49,300
he was going old school bell tour when
he was running things over there and a

183
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,920
king mo was pissed off at them and King
Mo most of this day calls him a Dick

184
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,420
Rider all the time.

185
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:54,850
There's the whole,

186
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,600
it's not good when you've got a guy like
king mo who's a very respected guy who

187
00:04:58,601 --> 00:04:59,860
is horrible things to say about you.

188
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,720
And I talked the association,

189
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:01,931
I went,

190
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:02,810
what are you guys doing?

191
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,310
Like you have one way to make
an impression and you do this.

192
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,790
You put your best foot forward
with this guy and then,

193
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,220
well,

194
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,120
I don't know the dude.

195
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,043
Do you know him?

196
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,410
I know of fighters who
have dealt with them.

197
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,730
I never thought for Bella tour.

198
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,970
So I know inside the fight or circle that
people have dealt with him for manager

199
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:20,860
and stuff like that.

200
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,400
But also personally I was looking at all
the tweets and all the negative stuff.

201
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:29,020
I think you can take a very positive
angle about improving the life and the

202
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:31,750
conditions of these fighters
without attacking people.

203
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:31,991
Yeah,

204
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:32,380
there's no,

205
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,280
there's no reason to attack.

206
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:35,470
It's also see what you
want about Dana White.

207
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:38,860
It's not his job to make sure you
guys get your shit together and form a

208
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:39,611
association.

209
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:39,941
He's like,

210
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:40,840
I'm a businessman.

211
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,710
I put on fights.

212
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,760
If you guys want to do that,

213
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,421
cool.

214
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:45,110
Get your shit together
and then bring it to,

215
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,390
and then let's figure something out.

216
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,920
But if you guys are
fighting with each other,

217
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,070
you don't want to Mcdonald's Gino

218
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,070
[inaudible].

219
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,140
Yeah.
