1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,860
Ready?
Five,

2
00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:03,270
four,
three,

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,950
two,
one.

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,830
Larry Sharp.
How are you sir?

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,990
I am doing great.
Thanks for having me.

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,400
Uh,
before we get started,

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,810
I like you.
Oh,

8
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,010
that's good.
I like you a lot.

9
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,330
I like winning Ryan,
man.

10
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,373
I'm just telling you right now upfront,
I've been listening to a lot of 

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,280
interviews,
watching a lot of your interviews.

12
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,670
You make sense.
It's almost like,

13
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:24,720
you know,
you can't win,

14
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,180
so you talking so logically you might 
win the,

15
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,090
yeah.
The hope is that the people who actually

16
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,640
have given up who think it's so stupid,
they don't bother voting.

17
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:36,474
Right.
So the hope is I say something that 

18
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:39,090
makes sense and I go,
oh,

19
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,130
maybe I should vote.
Oh my God,

20
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,620
maybe I should vote.
If those people vote,

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,790
you win.
I win.

22
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,823
Yeah.
There's an untapped resource of 

23
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:50,340
unmotivated people who are too fuck.
But how do we fix that?

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,290
Is it,
is it a matter of getting people,

25
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:57,291
I believe firmly that if we could get 
people to register and vote online,

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,810
especially with their phones,
it changes the world.

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,980
Yes.
Are Really,

28
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:03,180
really,
really believe that.

29
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:07,650
And I think that this is also a concern 
of the people that are in the Democratic

30
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,230
Party and the Republican Party and I 
think they want that 100% look.

31
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,990
They have a lot.
They're relying on voter apathy.

32
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,043
There were also relying on people who 
are committed to their parties and who 

33
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:20,370
are politically active,
which is not the majority of the people.

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,390
It's the establishment.
Right.

35
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,070
Look,
you asked how we fixed this.

36
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,790
Bernie and trump actually told us this 
in 2016 they told us two things.

37
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,430
Number one,
if you can get people to an event,

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,410
you can get them to the polling station.
Number one,

39
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:32,550
that's what they did.
A lot of events.

40
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,460
I do over 30 events every month.
I'm always doing events,

41
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:38,040
getting people to show up because if I 
can get him to show up to my event,

42
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,660
I can get them to a polling booth,
right?

43
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:42,900
Cause to come to s to hear me speak.
You have a lot of choices out there.

44
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:43,734
You can be on Netflix,
you can have with your family and 

45
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,070
friends.
You could be playing a video game.

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,310
You choose to come hear me speak,
you'll come to the polling station.

47
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,144
That's number one.
But how do I get into care in the first 

48
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:53,730
place?
It's hope.

49
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,370
The average person who votes often,
right?

50
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:59,010
If you vote often you use the vote 
because of fear.

51
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,200
The two party system installs fear,
right?

52
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,040
I don't really care about my guy or Gal,
but I'm so afraid of the other guy.

53
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,980
I'll go out and support my guy or gal 
even don't even know his name.

54
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,200
I just know I don't like the red team.
So by blue,

55
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:11,610
I don't like the blue team,
so I vote red.

56
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,550
But to get someone who doesn't vote and 
He York states really bad.

57
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,710
New York state,
about 70% of New Yorkers don't vote.

58
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,660
It's a huge chunk over 7 million New 
Yorkers.

59
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,200
70% yeah,
70% yeah.

60
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:21,034
Last likes,
I think it was 67% so it helped us 

61
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:27,180
around 70 to get those people out.
You have to give them hope.

62
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,120
Bernie gave the left hope.
Trump gave the right hope.

63
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,820
If the Democratic Party wasn't so broken
as a party,

64
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,150
Bernie would have been their nominee.
It would have been hope against hope.

65
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,340
It was hope against establishment hope.
One.

66
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,443
That's how it works.
I'm hope the other two guys who are 

67
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:42,170
running in my,
in my,

68
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,080
um,
election,

69
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,760
that totally establishment.
Well you say some really logical things.

70
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:50,090
So one of the things that you've said 
that nobody wants to touch you,

71
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:50,924
you were talking about gun violence and 
you were talking about these mass 

72
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:54,960
shootings.

73
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,793
Yep.
And you said there's two things that 

74
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,420
they have in common.
One of them,

75
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,950
they don't have relationships.
They're,

76
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,270
they don't have girlfriends.
Boyfriends,

77
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,420
well,
it's almost always girl,

78
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,120
a guy that does it.
Usually it don't.

79
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,490
And boys tend to be more violent in a 
tent.

80
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,740
Males tend to,
people get mad at me being sexist,

81
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:09,574
but I'm guessing are in stats.
That's just statistically males tend to 

82
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,070
outwardly strike.
Women tend to him when the strikers,

83
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,320
the general statistically,
and there's exceptions,

84
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:18,730
obviously.
The only other,

85
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,660
the other factor is psychotropic drugs.
Yep.

86
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,870
And these are two things that no one 
wants to talk about.

87
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:26,704
Correct.
And they're both real and they're both 

88
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,194
facts.
And why is it that you think that these 

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,873
are there obvious facts that people want
to ignore because they don't actually 

90
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,230
want to fix the problem?
Right?

91
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:40,570
If you fix the problem,
then you don't have controversy.

92
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,403
If you know of controversy,
you don't have a left versus right 

93
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,160
paradigm.
Do you realize that that's what it is?

94
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,250
Yes.
First off,

95
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:47,350
they don't want to touch the car.
They don't want to fix the problem.

96
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,420
If you want to fix the problem with 
school shootings,

97
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,130
right?
There's two things.

98
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,910
Remember as I'm,
as you've heard me say before,

99
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,600
the school shooting,
while it is a murder at its core,

100
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,823
it's actually a public suicide and 
people don't understand that at its 

101
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,200
core,
most mass shootings are public suicides.

102
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,630
They would understand that show.
It's like death by cop,

103
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,430
right?
It's public suicide,

104
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,070
so you have to make sure you have 
happier people,

105
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,780
right?
But then why did they school?

106
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,210
Why did they choose schools?
Several reasons.

107
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,380
One,
because that's where they're,

108
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,410
they're assumed enemies are right.
The insoles think that the guys,

109
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,240
the bad guys and the bad girls were 
there.

110
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,370
But something else,
the soft targets.

111
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,730
The other thing you remember from all of
these school shootings is there planned,

112
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,983
and that's a critical aspect.
You want to stop school shooting in New 

113
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,013
York state.
You don't have to pass one extra law at 

114
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:30,724
all.
Have do one minor thing and one thing 

115
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,810
only.
And that is say if you are a licensed,

116
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,060
uh,
if your license and you have a permit to

117
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:39,520
carry a firearm,
if you want to in school,

118
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,640
you may,
if you a teacher or administrator,

119
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,350
if you want to,
you may.

120
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,423
That's it.
You don't have to force a teacher to 

121
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:48,100
carry,
you don't need a resource officer.

122
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,470
Why?
Because if you have a resource officer,

123
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,170
which is what most Republicans will say,
put an officer there,

124
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,020
they'll just shoot him first.
If you all democrats,

125
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,760
no guns,
they'll shoot everybody.

126
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,590
So if you instead say,
well,

127
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,400
I don't know who's armed.

128
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,980
Is it an administrator as a teacher?
Is everybody isn't nobody.

129
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,250
The planning goes away once there's no 
planning available.

130
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,220
The school was no longer a soft target.
They stop choosing the school.

131
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,083
Okay,
Linda,

132
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,463
what's on practice?
So you're saying that if you have an 

133
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:19,210
officer on the school that carries a gun
and this person knows that officer has a

134
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,530
gun,
they will shoot him first?

135
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:21,364
Correct.
And that if just teachers are carrying 

136
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:24,034
guns,
there's no way this person knows and so 

137
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:28,300
they're less likely to shoot people.
They're are less.

138
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,830
There's two things.
If you,

139
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,380
here's the core of it.
What's killing our children?

140
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,990
It's not firearms.
The the one of the,

141
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,470
I think it was the Texas shooting,
I think it was before he stole the guns.

142
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,304
He had put together and set up pipe 
bombs and pressure cooker bombs in case 

143
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:43,360
he couldn't steal the guns.

144
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,940
So if he couldn't get guns,
he was going to kill people.

145
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:46,774
Anyway.
The key thing here is what's killing 

146
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,950
these kids?
Lack of community,

147
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,840
lack of purpose and loneliness.
That's what's killing our kids.

148
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,670
Those three things.
Take those three things away.

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,720
Kids don't do that.
You give a kid who's 16 1718 purpose,

150
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,760
he can't go off and kill people.
There's something to do.

151
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,380
Here's a reason to live.
Remember,

152
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:07,214
this is a public suicide.
If you have a reason to live and you 

153
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:11,420
think the right answer is to go do 
something,

154
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
you don't kill yourself.
If you don't kill yourself,

155
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,610
there's no public suicide,
mass shootings all of a sudden,

156
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,860
a tremendously reduced,
it's just how it works.

157
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,480
It's human nature.
You have to understand that,

158
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,240
but if you do that,
then there's no extra law.

159
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:24,800
Then there's no one to point a finger 
at.

160
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,300
You can't restrict guns.

161
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,463
What I'm saying just makes actual sense.
This is where you and I brick company 

162
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:31,004
because I don't agree with that.
I don't think that anyone is trying to 

163
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:36,650
keep the school shootings in the same 
state.

164
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:39,260
There are now.
I think that there's two things.

165
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:40,094
One,
no one wants to demonize psychotropic 

166
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:43,244
drugs and especially politicians.
They have a really hard time with that 

167
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,333
because they don't want to tell people 
who are on psychotropic drugs that 

168
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:53,630
they're either suspects or suspicious or
potential mass shooters.

169
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,633
It's incorrect.
We made the safe act and the safe act 

170
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,300
literally says,
if you go on these drugs,

171
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,134
you lose your firearm.
So that's absolutely not true in New 

172
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,410
York state.
It may be true in California,

173
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:05,360
I don't know your laws here,
but in New York state,

174
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,380
the opposite is true.
We've,

175
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,333
we've already done that.
We have made our medical personnel part 

176
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:13,520
of our secret state police,
which means if you go in and say,

177
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,570
I'm,
you know,

178
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,790
I'm feeling depressed,
I need some drugs,

179
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,170
I'm thinking about suicide.

180
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,423
The state police might combine,
take your firearms that's already 

181
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:24,650
happening in New York state and they now
want to create red flag laws,

182
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:27,260
which means a teacher can now do it.
So now a teacher says,

183
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,123
oh,
there's a student who I see drew a 

184
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,430
firearm.
He a gun cops and robbers,

185
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,013
maybe a red flag.
Let me go to a judge and see if I can 

186
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:37,310
have the cops go and take his father's 
firearm.

187
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,153
I'd definitely want to talk about this,
but I want to bring it back to what you 

188
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:40,574
said earlier.
You don't think they want to fix the 

189
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,520
problem yet?
Yeah,

190
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,583
I don't think that's true.
I just don't think they have a viable 

191
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:51,080
solution that they think is politically 
viable perhaps.

192
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:54,020
But I think my solution seems bloke 
avaiable people,

193
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:55,940
I,
I say everyone I say this too,

194
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:56,960
they go,
oh wow,

195
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,823
you're right.

196
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,083
Well,
you are definitely right that they're 

197
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,180
lonely,
sad people that are lashing out.

198
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,750
And I think you're definitely right that
in many instances it's a public suicide.

199
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,700
Yup.
And I think you're definitely right that

200
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:10,550
the vast majority of them are on 
psychotropic drugs,

201
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,730
which do have a disassociative,
uh,

202
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:14,564
aspect to them where they're not even 
sure they're aware of what they're 

203
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:17,540
doing.
This is,

204
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,980
if you've talked to him on those people 
that have been on these things,

205
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,083
things don't mean anything anymore.
Like a car accident in front of them 

206
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:30,260
doesn't mean anything.
People have various reactions to various

207
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,333
SSRS and the antidepressants.
But one thing that happens is you lose 

208
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,420
the highs and lows and everything is 
just flat.

209
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,680
You become numb.
Yes.

210
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,050
And you become numb to almost anything 
good happens.

211
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:43,490
Absolutely.
And again,

212
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,010
it varies depending upon the individual 
that's on these things.

213
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:46,844
Sure.
Part of that would allow someone to do 

214
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:53,150
something horrific,
which they wouldn't be able to before.

215
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,980
Well,
there's two things to remember here.

216
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,980
One.
I'm

217
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,140
not concerned with being righteous.
I'm concerned with happy New Yorkers and

218
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:00,300
happy people.
That's what I want.

219
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,210
Righteousness is very low on my priority
of things.

220
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:06,870
So if that doesn't sound,
if what I'm saying sounds bad,

221
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,820
I'm okay.
I want to fix the problem.

222
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,560
The second thing is I'm not a 
politician,

223
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,370
which means I don't have,
I don't have a uh,

224
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,020
a career I have to protect.
I don't have interests.

225
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,790
I have to serve.
The average donor is $75 so I don't have

226
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,530
a bunch of people who are,
I'm a huge checks,

227
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,513
so don't have that concern either.
So maybe in four years I'll be corrupt 

228
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:28,200
and you can beat your corrupt,
I mean,

229
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:31,410
I'm not saying that at all.
[inaudible] they're corrupt.

230
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,640
I mean,
I'm sure many of them are,

231
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,570
but I think that they just,
there's things they don't feel like they

232
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:38,370
can discuss politically.

233
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,533
And I think one of those things is in 
any way demonizing people who are on 

234
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,470
antidepressants because a lot of people 
along the highest percentage of people,

235
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,070
absolutely.
Our opiate crisis is,

236
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,100
is heavily based upon the idea that when
you have pain of any type physical,

237
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,573
mental,
the answer is not dealing with that 

238
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,660
pain.
But the answer is a once a day pill,

239
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,830
right?
Yes.

240
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:04,680
That is the answer for all of our pain.
And because of that,

241
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:07,470
you have a lot of people who are on 
drugs and you probably got a stat,

242
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,130
about 80% of all the people who are 
currently heroin addicts,

243
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,233
uh,
somehow started on someone's that even 

244
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:17,040
though it was theirs,
but someone's prescription legal,

245
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,903
legal drug,
I mean that was prescribed for the pain 

246
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:22,230
medication or something like that.
Usually pain medication.

247
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,420
But other things too,
you're totally correct.

248
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:25,020
This is a problem.

249
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,750
But what I'm saying is this,
where I talk about often people say,

250
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:28,860
Larry,
you know,

251
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,320
why should I vote for you?
Why should I support you?

252
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,170
Here's the reason why,
whether you believe I can win or not,

253
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,480
it's actually irrelevant.
If you think I could win,

254
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:38,430
awesome.
I can win and to be forward with you.

255
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,360
If I went in New York as a libertarian,
the entire nation changes overnight.

256
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,520
And that's not exaggeration.
The entire nation changes overnight.

257
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,120
This is the most impactful election.
Hands down the entire nation.

258
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,230
2018.
Why?

259
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,760
Because it's New York.
That's correct.

260
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:55,910
New Mexico.
Mary Johnson won.

261
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,090
Yes.
If I would,

262
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,480
New York State was ranked 50th by Cato.
Uh,

263
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:01,920
when it comes to freedom,
it is,

264
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,783
we have the most people leaving over a 
hundred thousand people leaving every 

265
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,200
single year more than any other state.
We also,

266
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,034
on top of that,
we were ranked the least friendly to 

267
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:10,494
retirees.
All of a sudden Larry Sharp libertarian 

268
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:13,284
becomes governor.

269
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,730
I mean,
it's insane.

270
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,790
The advantages.
It's a five way race in a five way race.

271
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,640
30% could win.
This is actually winnable race.

272
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:21,803
How's it a five way race?
It's going to be his majesty who are 

273
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:24,810
current king.
He will run,

274
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,610
um,
there'll be a republican slowmo cuomo.

275
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,240
Yes,
correct.

276
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,130
There'll be a republic home and His 
Majesty,

277
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,570
cause he's thinks he's a king and he is 
a king.

278
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,910
That's the reason when I'm in front of 
him,

279
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:37,911
I'll call him your grace to you.
I met him one time in 2014.

280
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,900
It was,
yeah.

281
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,930
Um,
yes he was.

282
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,250
Yes,
he was.

283
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,780
He was,
he was very dismissive.

284
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,853
Yes,
he was.

285
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,693
I was,
I was actually with the libertarian 

286
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:49,050
candidate.
Then in 2014 he was dismissive.

287
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,913
So His majesty will run a,
there'll be a republican sacrificial 

288
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:53,950
lamb placeholder.
Who knows.

289
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:54,784
He'll come in second,
probably third to me because New York 

290
00:11:56,061 --> 00:11:58,900
has basically always been a left wing 
state.

291
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,190
Not always.
Now I,

292
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:03,340
the last 16 years and the last 16 years 
in New York state,

293
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:05,020
same thing happens in a state wide 
election.

294
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,840
Blue team comes in first red team comes 
in second.

295
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,490
Nothing changes,
nothing changes.

296
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:11,410
That's been the last 16 years.
But prior to that,

297
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,820
Republicans did when it did happen,
but it in citizens tubes in,

298
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,693
what is she running as a,
she won't be running in about a week or 

299
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,570
so.
No.

300
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,381
She'll be finished.
Yeah,

301
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:21,220
she'll be fine.
Yeah.

302
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,350
How do you know?
Let,

303
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:23,184
let me,
let me give you the five people that 

304
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:24,970
I'll cover her.
Right?

305
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:27,400
Those two,
then Stephanie minor will run.

306
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:28,211
She's a,
uh,

307
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:31,640
an independent who runs out of Syracuse.
There'll be a green party communist.

308
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:33,130
So run how we hawkins.
Communists,

309
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,620
yes.
And if you call communism,

310
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,220
he wouldn't be unhappy if I called them 
that.

311
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,240
Really?
He's,

312
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,260
he's,
he's,

313
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,630
he would nod his head probably close.

314
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,380
Yeah.
Wow.

315
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,790
He'd be okay with that.
Um,

316
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,820
so him and then myself.
So five people running.

317
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,843
Okay.
With five people running New York 

318
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:51,820
state's a plurality state.
So 30% in theory could actually win this

319
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:52,654
thing with people who know who I am.
I already pulled it 25% this is about 

320
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,020
the Quinnipiac poll on Gravis marketing.
Paul both Poles,

321
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,960
I pulled about 25% of people who know 
you will know who I am.

322
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,000
My problem is name recognition,
right?

323
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,150
If more people get to know who I am,
then that number of,

324
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:09,580
obviously we'll be going higher.
And how much time do we have here?

325
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,070
Two months.
Here's the reality.

326
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,220
I get $2 million.
I win because all in dollars is all text

327
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,093
because I just need to get my name out.
I already have infrastructure already 

328
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,000
had the message.
All I needed to get my name out,

329
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,760
which takes what it takes is 
advertisements on local news.

330
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,980
News on local stations,
get my name out.

331
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,690
That happens.
I win.

332
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,870
That's not an exaggeration.
How important are the debates?

333
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:32,830
Debates are important.
If I,

334
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:33,664
if I don't get that money,
I'll have to intubate so I have to do 

335
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:36,294
it.
Jesse Ventura,

336
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,210
right.
Just even sure.

337
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,670
In Minnesota when he had the debates,
he won.

338
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,700
He handled the one in debates and that 
really gave him the,

339
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:43,900
uh,
they gave him the election.

340
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,763
That will give me the election.
People were a big fan of that movie 

341
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:48,280
Predator that yes,
because he didn't,

342
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:50,500
he didn't have time to bleed.
That's exactly right.

343
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:51,120
You Go,
yes.

344
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,953
But those are drawn fragments for those 
of you old enough to remember that 

345
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:55,270
movie.
Yes.

346
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,490
Jessie didn't have time to bleed,
so yes.

347
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,750
Um,
so that's,

348
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,210
that's what I'm saying with that we make
that happen.

349
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:04,150
We can actually win and change 
everything because all I need is my name

350
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:04,984
to get out.

351
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,100
But you asked about it.
The next Nixon,

352
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,233
Cynthia Nixon made an error.
Cynthia Nixon is not a politician and 

353
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:13,690
doesn't know politics and she thought 
that her celebrity would get her a pass.

354
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:18,580
The the democratic machine which is run 
by by Cuomo in our state,

355
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,390
so she ran a democrat.
Stephanie minor is also a Democrat,

356
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,870
but she chose not to run as a Democrat 
because she knew that if she ran is that

357
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,883
Cuomo crusher as Comos crushing Nixon.
How was he crushing Nixon in the 

358
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:31,384
Democratic convention?
If you are able to get 5% of the vote 

359
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:36,280
from delegates and you get to speak on 
stage,

360
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,550
cuomo controlled those delegates with an
iron fist so much.

361
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,413
He made sure Cynthia Nixon did not even 
get 5% she couldn't even get on the 

362
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:45,304
stage to speak and when to be clear said
the next one is a popular actor who 

363
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:49,960
lives in New York City.

364
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,700
There is no way they were enough people 
who would have,

365
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:53,534
if they wanted to hear out speak could,
would have voted 5% of course he made 

366
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:57,404
sure it didn't happen.
She had to submit 65,000 signatures to 

367
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:03,470
get on the actual ballot so she could be
in the primary.

368
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,280
There is no way that he allows her to.
When she doesn't win,

369
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,293
he debated her and because he thought,
let me just show people that that I 

370
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:13,430
don't care.
I can just dismiss her and that's why he

371
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:14,264
debated her and he's going to win and 
she's going to lose she and once she 

372
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:18,320
loses,
I don't think she's going to stay in.

373
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,110
I doubt she will if she does better for 
me because in the basics way race,

374
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,090
but I doubt she will,
she'll probably drop out in some way,

375
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:23,990
shape or form.
My odds.

376
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,820
All should run for Congress or something
like that.

377
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,833
In the working,
the working families party to do 

378
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:30,230
something like that.
The Working Families Party?

379
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:31,270
Yes.
That's another party.

380
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:32,031
So the party,
New York State?

381
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:32,864
Yes.
How New York state runs New York states 

382
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,150
has a,
is a fusion state,

383
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,910
which means you can run as multiple 
parties if you want to.

384
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,920
You can have three or four or five lines
if you want to.

385
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,680
So what often happens is the big two 
parties,

386
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,100
they use it as a way to have issue based
voters.

387
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,760
So they'll literally create parties to 
their credit part that says,

388
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,430
I'm the working families party.
And then people go,

389
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:53,510
oh,
well it's not a democrat.

390
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm a working family.
And they'll click that and it's the same

391
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:56,834
guy,
Como be on four or five lines happens 

392
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:01,250
off the Republicans on three lines and 
the Democrat.

393
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:05,270
I think we'll be on probably four lines.
It's a very complicated process.

394
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,480
No.

395
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,313
Is there any effort made or is there any
discussion whatsoever about potentially 

396
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:14,600
moving voting to online and is that 
something that you would not fail?

397
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,850
I'm not in New York state right now.
No,

398
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,780
I'm unsure.
Unsure of it.

399
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,510
I love the concept completely.
I do.

400
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,670
The only thing I don't know is it don't 
have the technology behind it.

401
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:23,900
I don't know how safe it is and you 
don't know,

402
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,480
but what about banking?
If you can bank online,

403
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,890
that's where all your money goes.
No,

404
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:28,724
I love the idea I missed.
I don't want to commit without knowing 

405
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:31,430
that the technology,
if we,

406
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,150
New York state is a problem because New 
York state throws out everything that is

407
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:36,950
new.
We've thrown up blockchain.

408
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,650
We don't want to do any open source.
Um,

409
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,530
we throw out a hemp and marijuana.
Um,

410
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,380
we were,
we,

411
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,410
we were trying to show the vaping 
industry.

412
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,240
I mean,
anything that's new in New York state,

413
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,103
we try to get rid of,
we able to stick with beating up uber 

414
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:49,934
now or taxing uber to pay for the MTA 
because the corruption by established 

415
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:57,080
bodies that are a hundred percent New 
York state likes old money.

416
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,320
We're really happy with old money.
We do not like new money at all.

417
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:02,240
Which is another reason why the youth is
leaving.

418
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,930
We are the hardest time getting the UFC 
and to New York because of yes,

419
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,003
absolutely.
I had to wait until they're one 

420
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:10,220
politician was arrested.
What was that one guy that went to jail?

421
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,320
New York state.
There's so many at you.

422
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,760
Yeah.
I forget who it was,

423
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:14,594
but he was corrupt.
He was one of the main reasons that it 

424
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,920
was,
they were trying to make an illegal.

425
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,030
Absolutely.
Um,

426
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,160
it's new,
which means by default,

427
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,910
hit it with a stick.

428
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,040
That's how New York thinks.
It's new.

429
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,240
Hit of a stick.
Don't like it.

430
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:29,660
It's new.
We want old stuff for a place called New

431
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,350
York.
Yes.

432
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,183
It's,
which is why my slogan is a new New 

433
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,520
York.
That's the reason why.

434
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:38,150
My slogan is that because we are right 
now an old New York and it's not helping

435
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:41,480
at all now as part is the Old New York 
speaking of,

436
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:43,580
of the people who are older people are 
retiring.

437
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,280
They can't stay in New York state 
because it's too expensive,

438
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:47,114
too expensive.
So they pack up and go to a North 

439
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,201
Carolina,
South Carolina,

440
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,820
Florida,
is it taxes?

441
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,550
The real estates?
Both its taxes and it's an opportunity.

442
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,900
It's both of those two things.
Right,

443
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:57,420
so it's so,
so they decided to head on down in North

444
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,021
Carolina,
South Carolina,

445
00:17:58,021 --> 00:17:58,854
Florida,
Tennessee.

446
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,840
They actually have a name for us in the 
Carolinas.

447
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:03,510
They call us halfbacks.
We went to Florida and halfway back.

448
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,970
That's true.
They call it halfbacks.

449
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,190
That's how many New Yorkers go there.
But he was the worst part.

450
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:09,150
Go to Florida.
Go,

451
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,440
ah,
this is a mistake.

452
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,060
There we go.
Say,

453
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,403
well,
the sad part here is though Florida 

454
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:18,640
actually has more people than we have 
and half of our budget and,

455
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,613
and Scott actually the governor Scott 
actually thanked Cuomo for sending all 

456
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:23,154
the people on that because 15% of New 
York state's budget is actually 

457
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,604
pensions.
And so many people who are pensions are 

458
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,900
actually leaving New York state and 
going someplace else.

459
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,793
So New York state people are paying for 
the pensions and then they're being 

460
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,540
spent in other states.
It's terrible idea.

461
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,400
We,
the state is broken.

462
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,030
It is so broken and people are talking 
about if you're Democrat,

463
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:44,570
you're saying everything's still great.
If you're Republican,

464
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,230
you're saying,
well tweak this or tweak that.

465
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,300
I'm saying rebuild from scratch.

466
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,163
There are things you have to change.
You have to change the route so you can 

467
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,720
make the branches actually die.
We keep clipping branches,

468
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,680
the weeds to keep growing.
Now we got way off track with this um,

469
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,210
school shooting thing.
And I wanted to get back to it because I

470
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,890
think it's a very complex issue and I 
need is,

471
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,480
I don't know what the answer would be.
I think there is no one in town.

472
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,363
Right.
I think you've found problems and these 

473
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:14,370
problems that you're willing to discuss 
it.

474
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:17,520
Very few people are,
are these people are lonely and sad that

475
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:20,010
it's a public suicide and that they're 
on psychotropic drugs?

476
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,873
Absolutely,
and I don't know why you don't think 

477
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:23,364
that other people want to fix it.
I just don't think that they have a 

478
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,064
solution that they can discuss that is 
not so controversial that it overwhelms 

479
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,850
the rest of their messages.

480
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,430
What could be done?
Sure.

481
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,800
I have a couple of answers.
Okay.

482
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,140
The issue is this is an issue that's 
been going on literally for decades,

483
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,950
so there is no do this and it's done.
Right.

484
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:43,920
Right.
There are several things.

485
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,670
One of them is fixing education.
The other one is fixing family courts.

486
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,560
Is it two things?
You start slow.

487
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,570
How do you fix education?
Absolutely.

488
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,433
It is a complete reboot right now.
The first thing I'm gonna do with 

489
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:55,464
education is you want to make sure there
is no standardized testing until high 

490
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:00,330
school.
None whatsoever sounded nice.

491
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:02,250
Testing is bad for several reasons.
Number one,

492
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,740
it's an unfair way of grading teachers,
right?

493
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:07,470
Teachers are now graded by how their 
students do on a standardized test,

494
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:09,090
which is silly.
That doesn't mean you're a good or a bad

495
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:10,440
teacher.
Next,

496
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,363
it makes a bunch of kids who are 10 11 
1213 years old feel stupid because 

497
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:15,354
they're not good test takers and you 
create now a secondary class of student 

498
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,553
for absolutely no reason because the 
next reason is standardized testing is 

499
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:23,370
no indication of success in life.

500
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,180
You could be a great test taker at 12 or
13 or terrible test taker,

501
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:29,760
and it does not mean you'll be 
successful or not successful in life.

502
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,300
Last is how New York state,
often we'll decide how to fund schools.

503
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,910
So it's a way of funding schools.
That's also unfair.

504
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,983
There's no advantage to standardize 
testing except it mean it means the 

505
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:42,360
federal government now begins to control
our schools more.

506
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,700
So when you say the standardized testing
has an,

507
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,073
there's an effect on funding,
does that mean that if a school does 

508
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:49,390
really well,
they get more money?

509
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,140
Yep.
Often.

510
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,973
It's part of a,
a very complex algorithm that New York 

511
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:55,420
state has that almost no one can 
actually find.

512
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,820
That seems like it should almost be the 
opposite,

513
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,953
that if a school does poorly that they 
should put more resources into that 

514
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,640
school because it's not being effective 
in theory.

515
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,380
That's true.
I'm not sure that's accurate either.

516
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:06,214
I mean,
we throw about $22,000 per student per 

517
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,930
year in New York state and we'll even 
than California and it doesn't work.

518
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:13,790
We have mediocre results at best dollars
isn't the answers.

519
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,370
It's revamping the system.
Right?

520
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:18,070
Funding is not the answer,
so how do you revamp the system?

521
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,400
There's more parts than that.
First one was just covering of that.

522
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,263
The second thing is we shouldn't even 
have k through 12 k through 12 was an 

523
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:25,594
anachronism in shouldn't exist because 
the last two years she be k through 10 

524
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,680
the last two years of high school for a 
huge chunk of people.

525
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,410
Jim,
study hall,

526
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,390
Video Games and probably smoking weed,
just nothing but bad foot.

527
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,070
Too many students just sitting around 
doing nothing.

528
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,560
They have no purpose.
There are no community.

529
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,670
They have.
They have no,

530
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,770
no reason to do anything.

531
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,670
They were unhappy.
Right.

532
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:49,504
Another reason why they're unhappy.
It's not a gross generalization that 

533
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,520
they're unhappy and I know thing.
I mean,

534
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,383
there's probably a lot of kids listening
to this that are 16 and 17 they're 

535
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:58,744
working their ass off right now and I 
have a section for that future and I 

536
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,410
have a solution for them.
That's even better.

537
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,460
I have a solution.
Again,

538
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:05,540
your limits moving,
right?

539
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,780
First thing is how do I know what I just
said is true,

540
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,950
right?
You just asked that question.

541
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,510
I'll tell you why.
What I just said.

542
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:11,344
Well,
I know it's true because for the vast 

543
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:14,050
majority of students going to college 
now,

544
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,943
the First Year of college is 13th grade 
because they're not ready for school 

545
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,030
because the last two years didn't 
prepare them for college.

546
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,580
If it did,
we wouldn't require 13th grade,

547
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,930
I don't know.
It's 13th grade.

548
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,110
The adverse that now take six years to 
graduate college,

549
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,260
so the results show me that I'm correct.
Right?

550
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,810
The results of what's happening and 
here's the worst part.

551
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,823
Now we shift these kids off to college.
Who many of them don't even want to go 

552
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:39,040
to college.
So we sent him anyway.

553
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,053
It takes them six years to graduate.
The 24 years old with at least 50 k in 

554
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:44,500
debt,
if not more,

555
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,570
minimum decay.
Some a hundred k something,

556
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:47,404
200 k depending what it is.
And now there's no job for what they 

557
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,910
want to do.
And now they're working at starbucks.

558
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,250
Wow.
What a disaster that is.

559
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:56,570
We wonder why our kids coming back home.
So how about this,

560
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:59,530
since that at 10th grade,
take a test.

561
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,080
You pass the test,
you get diploma with you,

562
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,400
a home school,
private school,

563
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:04,440
Public School,
diplomas,

564
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,283
yours.
Awesome.

565
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,020
Now you have five choices and this is 
exactly to your point.

566
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,940
You have five choices.
Choice number one,

567
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,760
you're a kid who's hardcore.
You think that college is your answer?

568
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,260
Good.
Go to to get prep school.

569
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,110
Imagine that kid who right now you just 
had is busting his ass.

570
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,670
He could be in,
in a prep school of his choice and,

571
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,563
and the people in that prep school are 
all kids who want to be in that prep 

572
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:26,260
school.
It would change his entire situation.

573
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,210
No more knucklehead who don't want to be
there,

574
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:30,400
who are forced to be there,
who will cut in class.

575
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,800
The kids would be,
there are those who want to be there,

576
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,410
the teachers and this,
no disciplinary issues.

577
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,980
They have more kids who want to be there
better for them.

578
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,840
They could hustle better now they're 
ready for college.

579
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:43,500
When they get there,
they take advantage of incubators of,

580
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:46,610
of internships,
maybe even graduate in three years now.

581
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,790
The Rock and roll them less debt.
Better off life is good.

582
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:52,310
Better services,
better everything for less money.

583
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,020
I'm not done.
You're not that kid.

584
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,260
You're the kid who is super smart human.
Become a scientist.

585
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,820
You want to be,
get a phd.

586
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,460
Awesome.
Go right to an associate's degree.

587
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,600
Start right away.
16,

588
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,700
17,
18 your degree because you're that good.

589
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:06,290
Take your sats.
You're that smart.

590
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,910
You're Einstein.
Awesome.

591
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,290
Go do that.
Not,

592
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,220
you know,
one of those things.

593
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,660
No worries.
Could Trade School,

594
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,300
uh,
become a plumber or a carpenter,

595
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,440
Mason,
whatever the case.

596
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:16,274
Let me go do it.
New York state desperately needs 

597
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:18,674
tradesmen desperately.
The average trade's person in New York 

598
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:21,524
states about 50 years old.
Too old for an average should be 30 

599
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:26,990
something for an average 35 and before 
an average it's too high,

600
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,973
which means we have a lot of trades,
jobs that are not filled and a lot of 

601
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,580
foreign labor that has to come to New 
York state,

602
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,530
right in New York or kids aren't doing 
it.

603
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,880
Why we've been told a lie and that lie 
is the only way to success.

604
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:40,370
The only way is to do well in high 
school.

605
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,250
Get a great for you degree and go get a 
job and sit behind a computer all day.

606
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,550
That's a lie.
That is a way to success.

607
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,640
It is not the only way to success.
There are a lot of kids now,

608
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,520
and I'm sure you know people like this 
who they spent the first five,

609
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:55,280
10 years of her life trying to make it 
that way,

610
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,520
struggling through school.
Then at 28 years old they go,

611
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,690
it's going to build houses,
man.

612
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,110
The nigga build the house or that's what
I make.

613
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,340
It's going to be a computer guy and they
just make apps.

614
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,420
He's gonna do something.
Want to do.

615
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,390
They should have been doing that at 18 
I'm still not done.

616
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:11,180
Most people though,
they don't know what they want to do.

617
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,270
This is a part and I get that.
The time don't have a passion.

618
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:16,940
They don't have a direction and they're 
confused.

619
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:17,803
Yes.
I,

620
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,760
this is one of my biggest complaints I 
got about this plan.

621
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:21,470
Right.
Because of the two ideas are cause he'll

622
00:25:21,471 --> 00:25:22,310
get a job,
right.

623
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,850
Just go work or start a business.
And what you just said is what I get all

624
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:26,550
the time.
But Larry,

625
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,820
they're 16 they don't,
they're doing good.

626
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,910
Make Your mistake at 16 not 26 we're 
making mistakes at 26 we have people who

627
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:35,624
are lost at 26 we have a generation now.
If you ask the people in their twenties 

628
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:40,080
right now across this,
across this nation,

629
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,710
and you say,
do you feel like an adult over half will

630
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:43,544
say no over half,
say no 40 year olds also the not as 

631
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:48,380
much,
but yes.

632
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,180
But not as much though.
It probably would be over half.

633
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,470
It won't be over half.
Okay.

634
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,270
You go to your 20,
somethings over,

635
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:54,350
half will say,
no,

636
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:55,970
I don't feel like an adult.
Right,

637
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,120
because they're making the same mistakes
that many people may 18,

638
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,730
1916 they're not making a 25,
26,

639
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:02,564
28 this was also not a rights of passage
things though thing that actually 

640
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:07,550
happens.
This would actually be that.

641
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:11,150
They'd have to make that choice at 16 
but here's the issue.

642
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,340
How do I pay for,
and this covers the entire sheet of what

643
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:14,510
you're talking about it.
That's the next question I get.

644
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:16,070
How you paid for it.
New York state says,

645
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:18,770
I have to pay for a full 12 years of 
school.

646
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,060
Have to pay for it.
It's pay for it.

647
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,070
No worries.
I was a marine.

648
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,520
When I got in Marine Corps,
I got a Gi bill x dollars,

649
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:27,350
I think it was $100,000.
I forgot what it was back then.

650
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,830
This was in the 90s.
Um,

651
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,800
I think at $100,000,
like 10 years to use it,

652
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,760
we're going to give all of our kids 
$20,000 and five years to use it.

653
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,653
They don't get the physical check,
but the state will pay a check to 

654
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:39,950
whatever school they want to go to for 
$20,000.

655
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,840
They have five years to use it.
Where does that mean?

656
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,860
You can at 16 slow experimenting.

657
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,241
You can say,
you know what?

658
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:47,400
I know college is for me.
I'm gonna go to prep school.

659
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,010
Here's what I promise you.
I promise you this,

660
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,570
the,
but any amount of money you want,

661
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,790
promise you this.
As soon as this comes into play,

662
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,833
you will find tons of all of a sudden 
prep schools and trade schools the pop 

663
00:26:58,421 --> 00:27:00,540
up and guess how much they're going to 
cost for two years,

664
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,870
$20,000 that's going to be a tuition.
You might say,

665
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:04,300
well,
wow.

666
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,550
[inaudible] a lot of money.
It isn't.

667
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:08,130
We're paying $44,000 now.
If each of those kids,

668
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,960
we're saving $24,000 per kid and giving 
them better schooling,

669
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,080
more accurate actual choices,
they can learn something.

670
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,033
They make their mistakes at 1617 which 
is way better than 26 or 27 and maybe 

671
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:24,780
they figure out they want to do well.
Why is it so cheap?

672
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:25,614
Why are you going to be able to do that 
for $20,000 when it costs so much more 

673
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:28,740
now?

674
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,470
What's going to be different that people
can be choosing,

675
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:32,851
right?
Yeah,

676
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,980
so the people that are educating these 
people,

677
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,360
yeah.
How are they going to get paid?

678
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,920
Oh,
where's the money gonna come from?

679
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:38,850
Great question.
Now,

680
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:41,010
a couple of things.
Remember teachers ask me all the time,

681
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:41,844
they say,
Larry,

682
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,710
how are you going to help us?
Here's what I tell you.

683
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,310
I'm going to get rid of a bunch of your 
administrators in New York state.

684
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:50,700
We actually have school districts that 
have more administrators than teachers.

685
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,930
What?
Yes,

686
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,330
that's correct.
Do you want homework?

687
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:55,530
What's the value of having 
administrators?

688
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,660
Because you have to check boxes for 
government.

689
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,240
You have to check boxes for coming.
Did you do x that you do?

690
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:02,250
Why did you do z?
These administers required,

691
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,750
that's what's going on.
That's correct.

692
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:06,500
There's,
there's about $60 billion in our budget.

693
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,353
New York state for education,
give or take about 4 billion comes from 

694
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,374
the federal government.

695
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,650
About 35 billion comes from the state 
and about 20 billion comes locally,

696
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,513
give or take it to it.
These are round numbers and they change 

697
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,190
yearly depending on,
on,

698
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,690
on who you talked about.
It's about that.

699
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,600
Once we get rid of the federal 
government,

700
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:22,950
being involved in,
in the,

701
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:23,784
uh,
in New York state for being [inaudible] 

702
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,210
goes away.
People get afraid.

703
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,290
Oh my God,
we lose that money.

704
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,000
Good,
good.

705
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:32,040
Let it go away because all of the 
ministers go away.

706
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,690
Also,
if you can give her a three,

707
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:34,321
four,
five,

708
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:36,060
six administrators for every one or two 
teachers,

709
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,460
oh my God,
I'm not good nutritional educator,

710
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:41,940
but I would imagine that if I was a,
I would be upset at this.

711
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:42,774
I would say that there's a reason why 
those administrators are there and we 

712
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:46,464
need them to take some of the 
administrative weight off of the 

713
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:48,894
teachers.
The teachers are stressed out enough by 

714
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,144
teaching students,
they don't have the time to be taken 

715
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:53,904
care of.

716
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,580
All the formalities and the things that 
these administrators too.

717
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,713
Um,
I have never heard that ever because 

718
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:00,384
that's not true.
You're the first person that ever said 

719
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,720
to me ever in over a year of me doing 
this.

720
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:05,970
So,
and the reason is those with you?

721
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:06,541
No,
no,

722
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:06,930
no,
no.

723
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,760
Not every teacher said,
I never heard it.

724
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,950
You never heard it.
Talked to a lot of,

725
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,380
lots of them.
Dozens of them does.

726
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:15,540
What did they say about administrating?
They say awesome.

727
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,080
Not In those words,
but yes,

728
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,973
because most of those administrators are
actually administrating teachers that 

729
00:29:22,821 --> 00:29:23,910
teach,
tell them how to teach,

730
00:29:23,911 --> 00:29:24,990
what to teach,
when to teach,

731
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:26,400
grading them.
Even if they don't,

732
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:28,020
who will the parents?
Well,

733
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,550
the parents will,
yes.

734
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:30,384
You think the parents have the time or 
the understanding of what an education 

735
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:37,230
should comprise of to be able to direct 
not just their,

736
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,840
their student,
what their child needs,

737
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,913
but you know,
a group of 50 or however large the 

738
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:43,450
class.

739
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,370
Great question.
And generally speaking?

740
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:47,320
Probably not.
But teachers do.

741
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,410
Teachers too.
They're going to self police.

742
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,300
There'll be some administrators.
You're,

743
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,250
you're assuming that I'm going to get 
rid of all administrators?

744
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:54,530
No,
no,

745
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,370
no,
I'm not.

746
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,220
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying,

747
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,480
but you're definitely saying you went to
school though.

748
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,670
Hold on.
You went to school.

749
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,103
Do you remember how many vice principals
that were any of your schools you 

750
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:05,210
remember?
No,

751
00:30:05,211 --> 00:30:06,044
I don't.
Probably two or three that was normal 

752
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,850
and met most schools when I was his 
goal.

753
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,890
Often it was two or three.
I don't remember.

754
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Now there's 12 1210 40 why?
Why is that?

755
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:20,140
Because their administrators and they're
making sure other things,

756
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,070
they're making sure boxes are checked.
So here's your alternative.

757
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,600
You're alternative is keep funding a 
broken system and be afraid,

758
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,980
which is what you're saying.
No,

759
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:30,814
I'm not saying you're saying,
you're saying teachers will be afraid 

760
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,070
because I'm afraid.

761
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,933
Yeah,
because then Hio Frey who educated our 

762
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,041
kids.
No,

763
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,240
no.
Overwhelmed.

764
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,230
Overwhelmed.
Okay.

765
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,820
Fear of,
of being overwhelmed.

766
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:41,200
Not just,
not just that,

767
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:45,940
but also like having a mandate,
like having,

768
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,980
Yup,
a very strict,

769
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,200
I'm with you.
Curriculum.

770
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,063
Yes.
See she's children and that is nothing 

771
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:52,864
but a bad thing.
I'm going to give you real fast if you 

772
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:54,964
don't mind.
Let me give you a list of all the time 

773
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:57,394
centralized control has worked.
Finished centralized control doesn't 

774
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:02,554
work in in education meaning what?
In anything when a centralized control 

775
00:31:06,471 --> 00:31:08,980
and make things better defined,
centralized control,

776
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,610
a strict mandate from Albany,
a strict mandate from DC.

777
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,120
I'll ask you a question.
I'm,

778
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:14,954
I'm assuming you're old enough that you 
were in school at one point at 1980 or 

779
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:19,390
older.
Oh yeah.

780
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,860
Or before I was,
yes.

781
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,700
Prior to 1980 basically the partner of 
education didn't really exist as it does

782
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:25,390
now.

783
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,520
It did exist,
but it was basically as a repository for

784
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:28,354
information.
It didn't really do anything and I 

785
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:32,170
didn't have any power since that's an 80
began to have power.

786
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,930
Do this and we'll give you money.
Don't do this.

787
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,850
We don't give you money.
Here are your rules.

788
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:37,684
Follow them up.
We punish you that that's what they are 

789
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:42,520
now.
You learn to read and write.

790
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,150
You learn to function in society,
so die somehow.

791
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:48,730
Every American prior 1980 when the 
school learn how to read and write,

792
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,130
learn how to function in society.
Somehow it worked.

793
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,100
Do I trust the administrator or a 
teacher?

794
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,443
I would rather trust the teacher.
Now does that mean they'd be no 

795
00:31:57,491 --> 00:31:58,840
ministers?
Of course then there'll be a minister.

796
00:31:58,841 --> 00:31:59,674
Of course they will be.
There'll be still principles and things 

797
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:03,370
of that sort of course.
But the differences,

798
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,230
an administrator cares about checking a 
box,

799
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,323
check a box.

800
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,390
Your cigarettes aren't better off 
because boxes are checked.

801
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,463
You said it's a better off because these
students are getting better and because 

802
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:14,620
the parents are happier.
Right,

803
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:16,660
but when you're saying boxes being 
checked,

804
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:17,494
that means things being covered that 
they feel the signet for a standardized 

805
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:20,740
test.
Yes.

806
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,270
You two said that they feel 
significance,

807
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:23,104
correct?
Yes.

808
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,490
Well,
that's someone,

809
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,210
I mean I would assume,
I don't know how curriculums are set up,

810
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:29,044
but I would imagine that people get 
together and they decide that children 

811
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:32,830
need to have a certain amount of 
ability.

812
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,480
Yup.
And with grammar.

813
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,413
Yes.
Certain amount of understanding of 

814
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:36,880
mathematics.
Yes,

815
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,380
I would agree.
Yes.

816
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,220
Who's going to do that?
How about

817
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,280
teachers and the local administrators 
and how about the local PTA?

818
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:45,180
What's wrong?
So less administrators,

819
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,020
an elimination of administered.
I never said that,

820
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,913
so I didn't say you did,
but how do we decide how many 

821
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:53,540
administrators are necessary and how 
many can you cut out?

822
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,060
How much money can you save this and 
this is even better.

823
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,190
You know that you're going to love my 
libertarian ways on this one.

824
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,760
Right now what happens is there is a 
convoluted way of deciding house.

825
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,990
What a convoluted way I thought he said 
come loaded.

826
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,850
Did you hear that?
It could be,

827
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,073
but no,
I don't think it alluded and convoluted 

828
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,233
way.
Like this is a new word and I don't 

829
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:13,550
think it should be used.
Is that,

830
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,260
is that new?
No,

831
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:17,690
not convoluted.
The other ones I'm loaded.

832
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:18,770
I was like,
this is,

833
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,770
I'm sure as a fetish there somewhere.

834
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,710
I'm sure there is.
I just haven't heard of me there.

835
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,640
See you.
You're ready to go now.

836
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,900
So there's a calm that a way of actually
of funding these schools.

837
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,850
I don't want that.
I want to be very simple.

838
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,580
I want a flat fee to come from the state
here,

839
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:36,350
district,
depending on how many kids you have,

840
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,540
here's your money.
What does that mean?

841
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,910
Well,
the reality of it is there are about,

842
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:41,744
if I'm not mistaken,
about 700 school districts in New York 

843
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:43,850
state.
A lot.

844
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,500
A lot.
That's a lot.

845
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,363
It is a lot.
And so what happens now is there's your 

846
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:49,184
money.
Most of them are going to make no 

847
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:52,760
changes because they're gonna be afraid.
But it's like anything else.

848
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,890
There'll be early adopters and early 
adopters are going to say,

849
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:57,470
wait a minute.
So the federal government isn't going to

850
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,570
do this.
The state government isn't telling us to

851
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:00,404
do that.

852
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,390
So we can change some things here.
So when you say,

853
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:03,224
here's your money,
they're going to get less money than 

854
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:06,110
they're getting now.
It depends.

855
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,810
It depends on the school district.
So we'll somewhat there.

856
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,630
It's not like you'll have less jobs 
there.

857
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:14,760
They're going to have to decide whether 
or not minnis traitors.

858
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,310
You got it.
Exactly right.

859
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,080
Yes.
And you're saying,

860
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:19,340
oh my God,
that's scary.

861
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,860
Some of our school districts will fail.
Yes.

862
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,120
But in New York state,
they're all failing now.

863
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:26,300
So I don't care.
But the trailers in mass right now,

864
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,860
I'm okay,
let me finish.

865
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:28,803
Please go.
I don't want government to be what you 

866
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:32,750
always hear,
which is,

867
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,970
you know,
elections have consequences.

868
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,163
So I,
when I now get to impose my will upon 

869
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:39,980
all of you,
cause I won.

870
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,220
So what I say goes,
I'm supposed to know everything,

871
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:45,320
be everything,
create boards and make things happen.

872
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,770
I instead want to be the guy who when 
you have trouble,

873
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,083
I can help.
So as school districts begin to have 

874
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:53,384
trouble,
I will without question try to help 

875
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:55,900
them.
Of course I wrote,

876
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,820
but there's 700 that's correct.
How would you have time to do that?

877
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,470
I won't personally.
I'll have people who would have,

878
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:03,680
right now there's already an 
infrastructure to handle that already.

879
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,600
I don't have to create a new one already
exists,

880
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,200
but right now it's just,
it's making up reasons to punish people.

881
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,360
I don't want it to make it reasons to 
punish people.

882
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,950
I want instead to say,
okay,

883
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,290
this school district is lost.
How do we help?

884
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,500
I only have one string attached to the 
money.

885
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:21,020
I give only one,
and that is transparency.

886
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,243
As I told you before,
I'm a business guy and here's what I 

887
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:24,134
know.
This is an actual equation that works 

888
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,870
every single time.
Very simple,

889
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:30,140
simple equation,
personal freedom plus transparency,

890
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,430
plus accountability equals innovation.
If we do that,

891
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:35,264
the other doctors will come on.
They will find great ways of making 

892
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:38,040
things work.

893
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,450
They will get rid of some 
administrators,

894
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,610
they will get rid of some teachers,
they will hire new ones.

895
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:43,530
They will decide which one should be 
given raises.

896
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,790
That will happen.
Okay,

897
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,080
those after you there,
please go ahead.

898
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:46,914
Because what you're saying may work in 
the world of business because people 

899
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:51,504
have incentive to succeed in business 
and that extensive is monetary success 

900
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,970
when he always monetary,
but yes.

901
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,680
Okay.
Not always,

902
00:35:58,681 --> 00:35:59,940
but for the most part.
Yep,

903
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,880
sure.
When you're talking about a school,

904
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,753
yes.
And you cut the funding for the school 

905
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:05,341
and say,
Hey,

906
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:06,174
figure it out.
You guys decide how many administrators 

907
00:36:08,491 --> 00:36:10,800
you want to keep art.
The administrators',

908
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,680
essentially the bosses,
aren't they the ones who are in control?

909
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,900
I mean they're not going to get rid of 
their own jobs,

910
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:16,763
so what are they going to do?
You're going to pay the teachers last 

911
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:20,730
and they going to get an inferior 
teachers and it's a great question.

912
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,340
Ramp up their,
their control of the,

913
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:25,950
of the cashflow because they realize 
that there's less of it.

914
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:26,843
It is a,
it's a great question and here's the 

915
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:29,340
issue.
It's not going to happen overnight.

916
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,830
It's not like I went in November and go,
great.

917
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,560
All the money's gone to how it works.
I went in November.

918
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,590
People know what the plan is.
We start talking about it already.

919
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,720
We start bringing parents on board.
We said,

920
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:41,310
coming up with plans already,
the plans,

921
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:41,790
it's like,
uh,

922
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,800
it's like,
it's like any other organization.

923
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,730
You're saying business.
I'm like,

924
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:45,990
oh,
this works in military.

925
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,360
This works in,
this works in business.

926
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:49,620
It doesn't matter.
Works and everything.

927
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:50,454
What's your family?
It doesn't matter if you knew that six 

928
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:56,700
months from now you're going to have a 
sniff and decrease in your income.

929
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,680
You would start to make change.
Typically,

930
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:00,720
if there was someone above you saying,
hey joe,

931
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,490
you're going to have a decrease in your 
income.

932
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,280
How do we make this work?
What can we do?

933
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:09,630
If someone's there to guide you and you 
already have infrastructure there,

934
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,553
you'll begin to fix it.
My fear would be that they would have 

935
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:16,590
less teachers and then we have larger 
classes.

936
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,380
Totally possible administrators because 
they're in control.

937
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:23,490
People don't like to give up control and
control.

938
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,440
Well,
who's actually in control with the PTA?

939
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,393
Right?
The parent teachers association can and 

940
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,880
have a lot to heat to the board to sign 
boards would decide,

941
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,720
but they would have to agree with you.
Yes.

942
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,060
They want to get rid of administrators 
and if they didn't universally,

943
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:36,894
if they didn't universally across the 
board in this fails miserably and then 

944
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:42,300
classes get larger and then kids get 
less attention.

945
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,540
Yup,
and then the already Piss poor education

946
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:49,470
system sinks further into the abyss and 
we have two choices.

947
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,423
Number one,
we can be afraid of that and stay a 

948
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:55,164
hostage to a terrible system that's not 
working as failing our kids and making 

949
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:58,360
us in happiness.

950
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,193
Jordan estate.
That's option one or option to do that 

951
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,050
and just watch over it.
Right.

952
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:08,070
Understanding that that could happen 
because those were the only two options.

953
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,210
These other options.
The other option is yes,

954
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,610
funded more.
Ooh,

955
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,590
fuck a bad system.
Boom.

956
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,250
No.
Why is that?

957
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,630
If you had a 10 what's,
what's wrong with the system?

958
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:19,770
Let's go over that.
I just told you.

959
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,430
I don't know,
but no,

960
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:23,280
but I mean in terms of like how much 
money are they making,

961
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,210
right,
and what would increasing that amount of

962
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:30,000
money enhance.
Okay.

963
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,133
Two things.
Remember the first thing is there's no 

964
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,100
way in the world that a governor

965
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,340
should be deciding what every teacher 
makes an estate.

966
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,350
Okay.
That's just philosophically wrong,

967
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,800
so I'm never going to do that.
That is simply philosophically wrong.

968
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:46,810
It's against who I am.
Centralize,

969
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,570
centralize.
Control was a bad idea.

970
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,790
Localized control is always a better 
idea for,

971
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,300
so that's so that that premise,
I'm never going to even touch that.

972
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,780
What I'm trying to achieve here is to 
make change.

973
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,153
I know that locally there will be people
who do it right because that always 

974
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:05,890
happens.
That's just how it works.

975
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,420
You will see out of seven districts,
some of it decide to to,

976
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,450
you know,
get together and,

977
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:12,130
and,
and mix this together.

978
00:39:12,131 --> 00:39:14,740
Some will decide not to.
Some will do different things.

979
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:17,530
You'll see it happen.
My point is this is a major overhaul.

980
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:18,740
I get it,
right?

981
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,980
Businesses there all the time.
Families do all the time.

982
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,053
If you're able to watch it,
I don't want to be the mother or the 

983
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:27,460
father,
right?

984
00:39:27,461 --> 00:39:29,560
Democrats won't be your mother.
They wouldn't to give you everything,

985
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,870
going to be a father and protect you 
from everything.

986
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,003
I wonder,
your brother,

987
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,930
let me to get you love.
You don't want to live with them,

988
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,610
but you love him and when you need a 
ride to the airport,

989
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:39,640
he's there for you and with the 
firefighter,

990
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,140
the guy who comes to help when you need 
me.

991
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,180
Now you're saying,
but Larry is good.

992
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,014
This will fail.

993
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,480
Yes.
I want them saying,

994
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,440
well,
okay,

995
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,130
some might fail.
That's you're saying some,

996
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,860
some.
I'm not even saying they might fail.

997
00:39:49,861 --> 00:39:52,830
What I'm saying is that you're going to 
put them in a compromised situation.

998
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,720
Yes.
You're going to give them less money and

999
00:39:54,721 --> 00:39:56,310
you're going to say figure it out.
Yes,

1000
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,144
but not just see.
You're assuming that it's just here's 

1001
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:00,570
money.
Good luck.

1002
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,770
No,
here's less money.

1003
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,120
Yes.
He's less money.

1004
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:03,954
Yes.
I think you have too many 

1005
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:05,470
administrators.
Yup.

1006
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,030
And let's talk this out over a series of
several months.

1007
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:09,864
When you talk to professional educators,
do they agree that they have too many 

1008
00:40:11,881 --> 00:40:14,580
administrators do money?
Yes.

1009
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:16,500
So far everything's your,
I've met everyone,

1010
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,260
but they agree they do well with less 
money if they didn't have to.

1011
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,103
Miniaturize is yes.
And how much less money are we talking 

1012
00:40:21,571 --> 00:40:23,100
about?
I'm not sure to be fair with you.

1013
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,113
Not sure yet.
This is the one show you that you feel 

1014
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:26,364
like the way to fix the education system
is the cut funding that would like for 

1015
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:33,000
people like me who are on the outside,
you hear that and you go,

1016
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,863
Ooh,
I already feel like teachers are 

1017
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,900
underappreciated.
And probably because of that unmotivated

1018
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:42,960
because you decided to say the answer is
cut funding.

1019
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,330
It's not what I saw on,
no,

1020
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:44,690
no,
no,

1021
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,523
no.
When I started this of what you were 

1022
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:46,980
saying.
Yup.

1023
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,190
Regardless of what you're saying.
What I'm saying is currently,

1024
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,420
Yup.
Even in California,

1025
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:52,300
forget about New York.
Yup.

1026
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,080
I feel like teachers are 
underappreciated.

1027
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,973
I would agree with that and I feel like 
it's a noble profession that's 

1028
00:40:58,651 --> 00:41:01,950
incredibly valuable and the people 
should be able to make a decent living.

1029
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,210
Agreed.
I don't know how.

1030
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,450
The solution to that is to give less 
money to the school.

1031
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,800
You're missing a very valid,
very important point.

1032
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,010
If you ask most teachers whether 
underappreciated,

1033
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,033
most of them,
they're not going to say that people 

1034
00:41:14,061 --> 00:41:16,730
like you and I don't appreciate them,
they're going to say,

1035
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,713
the system doesn't appreciate me.
That's why they're always fighting the 

1036
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:20,810
system.
Oklahoma,

1037
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,540
they fought the system.
They always fighting the system.

1038
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,600
What I'm saying is fix the system.
The system is heavily controlled in many

1039
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,800
cases by the federal government.
$4 billion worth,

1040
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,873
so we have to lose $4 billion unless we,
unless we want to keep the federal 

1041
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:37,310
government in our system,
but you don't want that.

1042
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,370
Your fix is to let them figure it out.
Get the federal government out.

1043
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,400
Hold on,
let them figure it out with less money.

1044
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,870
I have to,
I have to push back here.

1045
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:45,671
Okay.
You,

1046
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:46,504
you keep saying,
let him figure it out as if I'm just 

1047
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:49,880
going to walk away and say,
oh well good luck.

1048
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,620
I hope I'm going to go off and now you 
know,

1049
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:53,840
hang out in Puerto Rico for a while.
No,

1050
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,420
I'm saying I'm gonna facilitate it 
because you know what I do.

1051
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,820
I trust teachers more than twice 
administrators.

1052
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,210
I trust the local people that if I give 
them the right tools,

1053
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,690
they'll do the right thing,
but more importantly they'll show others

1054
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,703
as also transparent.
What's going to happen is they're going 

1055
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:10,310
to figure out the right way to deal with
teachers.

1056
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,110
Should should school district one hire 
more Spanish teachers versus going stick

1057
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,530
to,
I don't know.

1058
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,393
I'm not supposed to know that,
but they do and if they make a mistake 

1059
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,350
then they'll fix it.
And then other counties,

1060
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,843
are you talking about the teachers 
themselves or are you talking about 

1061
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:27,050
these administrators who you want to 
eliminate?

1062
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:29,250
I'm talking about the school boards,
the school board.

1063
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,350
The school boards are going to be the 
ones with the,

1064
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,660
with the PTA.

1065
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:39,580
If we make this work the right way,
it will be everyone talking together.

1066
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,860
It will be school boards talking to 
administrators,

1067
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,660
talking to teachers,
talk with parents.

1068
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:49,670
I don't want schools graded beat by 
standardized tests.

1069
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,460
We've been doing that for years and we 
have very,

1070
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:54,650
very unhappy people.
Unhappy Students,

1071
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,740
unhappy parents.
I want parents to be happier.

1072
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,750
I want students to be happier and you 
might say,

1073
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:01,640
but then Larry,
they won't learn certain things.

1074
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,623
Is that a horrible thing?
I'd rather than be happy than learn ap 

1075
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:08,030
chemistry.
Yes.

1076
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,163
If that means one school decides that ap
chemistry isn't that important in a 

1077
00:43:11,711 --> 00:43:12,920
school district,
it's fine.

1078
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:13,783
Those kids will learn it in the prep 
school and some kids won't learn ap 

1079
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:16,994
chemistry.
If that makes your school district 

1080
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:18,584
happy,
I'm okay with that because it goes to 

1081
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:20,744
the next level,
which of course becomes kids with 

1082
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:23,114
special needs.

1083
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:26,330
You have a special needs kid.
How do you make that kid happy?

1084
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:27,980
How do you decide whether a kid kids 
successful or not?

1085
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,160
The standardized testing doesn't work.
What do you do?

1086
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:33,260
These are doing check boxes.
Does that work?

1087
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:34,094
Of course.
That's why you literally have hundreds 

1088
00:43:35,061 --> 00:43:37,580
of parents every single year,
so in New York state,

1089
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:38,414
because they were unhappy with their 
kids getting services but not getting 

1090
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:42,650
better.
I want your kid getting better.

1091
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,373
You're assuming that because the federal
government puts these standards in it 

1092
00:43:46,701 --> 00:43:48,500
that makes them good or bad.
It doesn't.

1093
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,850
If anything,
it makes them worse.

1094
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,360
If kids,
if my kids are happy,

1095
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:57,020
that's what I want.
Happy New Yorkers means they stay in New

1096
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:57,853
York.
Happy New Yorkers means they grow their 

1097
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:00,970
businesses in New York.
Keep their families in there.

1098
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,813
I get that,
but saying happy and saying that 

1099
00:44:03,681 --> 00:44:04,514
solution and the key to happiness is 
funding them less and getting rid of 

1100
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:11,240
administering goggling the Democrat Joe,
I'm the Democrat.

1101
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,730
Yes you are.
Thank God you are so a Democrat.

1102
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,593
How am I a democrat?
You got [inaudible] being the world's 

1103
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,800
ending less funding means the world's 
anymore.

1104
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,250
People that hear that you're going to 
take money away from school.

1105
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:23,084
The person who only hears that.
If the person says all he's going to do 

1106
00:44:26,091 --> 00:44:28,940
is get rid of money from schools,
that's that person's never going to vote

1107
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:30,740
for me.
That person's probably a democrat.

1108
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,510
That problem's person's going to vote 
for Cuomo and that's fine.

1109
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:35,100
I'm not gonna win everybody.
I can't win everybody,

1110
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,740
but I'm going to change a system that is
completely broken.

1111
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,933
If you say this,
what you're talking about people talk 

1112
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:42,090
about with the MTA also in New York 
City,

1113
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:43,770
the MTA,
you got to keep funding the MTA.

1114
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,920
I'm not going to be hostage to a shit 
system,

1115
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,690
period.
I don't care.

1116
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,290
I'm not going to be hostage to a shit 
system.

1117
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,170
This is a terrible system that is 
failing New Yorkers.

1118
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,300
That is failing people in New York City.
When it comes to the MTA,

1119
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,760
that's fairly big state.
That's mass transit.

1120
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:00,361
I'm sorry.
Yes.

1121
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:02,610
If those of you are not in New York,
it's a bad system.

1122
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,350
I'm not going to be a hostile because of
fear.

1123
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,243
No,
I will fight my jailer period and my 

1124
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:10,110
Jello is a system that is broken that 
says if you,

1125
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,880
if you,
you better give me more money.

1126
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,430
Otherwise it'll happen.
You better give me more money.

1127
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,510
Otherwise it will happen.
No,

1128
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,660
no,
I'm going to fix that system.

1129
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,990
I'm going to help facilitate fixing that
system.

1130
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,750
Am I just to let them go away?
I'm not saying that.

1131
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,200
What I'm saying is I'm going to help 
facilitate that system and to do that we

1132
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:30,450
can lose $4 billion and we'll get over 
that.

1133
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:31,740
We'll fix that,
we'll make it happen.

1134
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:32,723
We'll make it work so by,
and if you get more people into this 

1135
00:45:35,281 --> 00:45:37,140
state,
and this is the most important piece,

1136
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:38,723
you can raise money through other ways 
and just raising taxes on people and 

1137
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:44,550
this is the most critical piece when we 
hear funding,

1138
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:45,384
and this is why I'm,
I was teasing you in Konya Democrat 

1139
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,630
because we need to about funding.
You're talking about more taxes.

1140
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:49,913
I'm not talking about that.
If you get more people to stay in New 

1141
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,270
York state,
you raise your revenue without having to

1142
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:56,400
raise taxes on anybody.
But if you raise your revenue,

1143
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:58,530
we're going to put more revenue into the
schools of course,

1144
00:45:58,531 --> 00:45:59,970
to be more people in the schools.
More reverent.

1145
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:01,950
Yes,
absolutely.

1146
00:46:01,951 --> 00:46:02,784
Your money in the school,
there'll be more people in the schools 

1147
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:06,480
and more Morton.
Of course we would if we could.

1148
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:07,920
Re of course we would.

1149
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,173
Of course,
New York state has $170 billion budget 

1150
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:15,690
with about a $4 billion deficit and $300
billion in debt,

1151
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,170
and the answer for every Democrat or 
Republican is more funding.

1152
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,240
There's going to be nothing left.
This state is going to go different.

1153
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,083
It's gonna go.
It's going to,

1154
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:24,143
it's going to go under in 10 years.
How do you get more people to come to 

1155
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,950
the stair right first thing by having a 
really super court cases,

1156
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:32,670
and I talked about super cool education 
that'll get people to come back.

1157
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,940
Are you going to hire someone to create 
this super cool education system?

1158
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:37,710
Are you going to let these teachers 
figured it out on their own?

1159
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,573
If we need teachers,
build me a super cool education system 

1160
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:43,110
so that we get more fun.
I already have the,

1161
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,870
I already have the infrastructure for 
the super cool system.

1162
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:47,800
I just told you,
I've already told you what that,

1163
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,030
what the instructor is done.

1164
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,030
The concept or at a skeleton is already 
there.

1165
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,460
Now,
once I win in November,

1166
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,000
we begin to build it out and yes,
it will be me and other people be clear.

1167
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,220
It's not like New York doesn't have 
enough.

1168
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,173
New York's doesn't have enough workers.
We have tons of workers that we can 

1169
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:07,170
absolutely use to make this happen.
Tons of them that if I'm not mistaken,

1170
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:10,440
the New York state has the most by 
percentage,

1171
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,840
uh,
government employees I think.

1172
00:47:11,841 --> 00:47:13,920
And I think in the nation,
I know we are the most unionized,

1173
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,180
but I think we're the most,
uh,

1174
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,830
uh,
government employees by percentage.

1175
00:47:16,831 --> 00:47:18,520
You're going to move their jobs.
Sure.

1176
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,280
Love it.
Yes,

1177
00:47:20,281 --> 00:47:21,750
let's do that.
Love the idea.

1178
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:22,913
You're asking details that are simple to
fix when the time comes and simple to 

1179
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:27,144
fix.
So you're going to take people out of 

1180
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:30,070
what professions move them

1181
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,460
into fixing.
I actually it beside it for every person

1182
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:34,660
in New York state where they're going to
do.

1183
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,520
I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

1184
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,170
Of course not you.
This is a,

1185
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:40,870
you're doing it like a show now.
I'm not doing a show.

1186
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:42,250
Do you?
You're a democrat.

1187
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:43,120
Look at you.
You're a democrat.

1188
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,130
I'm not.
I'm giving,

1189
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:49,030
I'm just asking you a real clean 
questions here.

1190
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,030
You four times said you're going to take
money away,

1191
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,040
but you are right.
Yes.

1192
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,990
You've said like four times because you 
going on about these other things,

1193
00:47:58,991 --> 00:48:02,080
which is what matters more than losing 
$4 billion from education.

1194
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:02,914
Right?
But I just want to be clear about what 

1195
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:04,534
you're saying about what the actual 
going to fix this system by creating a 

1196
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:11,680
good skeleton off the bat that people 
are going to enjoy and like,

1197
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:12,993
and then once I went in November,
we're going to fill that skeleton up to 

1198
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:18,400
make an amazing school system that 
people can be proud of.

1199
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,770
They're going to want to bring their 
people,

1200
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,604
they're gonna come back from North 
Carolina that had come back from 

1201
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:23,920
Tennessee.
They're going to move from,

1202
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,580
from Pennsylvania and Massachusetts and 
want to be part of their system.

1203
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,800
They're going to see schools that 
actually work well.

1204
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,720
They're going to see prep schools,
get kids into college.

1205
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:32,703
They're going to see colleges that 
actually educate kids and get them into 

1206
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:36,310
jobs.
When they see that happened,

1207
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:38,230
that all start coming.
That's going to happen.

1208
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,200
It doesn't happen by me saying,
how do I fund this?

1209
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,810
It doesn't happen by me saying,
being afraid of making a step.

1210
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,200
You don't have to have the perfect plan 
to move forward.

1211
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,423
No plan is perfect anyway.
You want a good solid plan with 

1212
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:52,444
motivated people.
If you have motivated people to take up 

1213
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:56,890
a plan,
it'll wind up being successful again,

1214
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:57,724
it's how it works.

1215
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:59,103
So this grandiose plan is I like,
you're going to get rid of the last two 

1216
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:08,311
years of high school and you're going to
offer potential prep school for children

1217
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,130
and you're going to,
for other kids,

1218
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:14,050
offer them trade schools,
schools.

1219
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:17,590
Sure you're going to get rid of $4 
billion in federal funding.

1220
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:18,653
You're going to let the schools figure 
out how many administrators they should 

1221
00:49:21,641 --> 00:49:23,770
have with help with help,
with help,

1222
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,080
and who wants to help,
who are you going to hire it?

1223
00:49:26,081 --> 00:49:27,730
Oversee this whole thing.
We'll figure it out.

1224
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,350
You figure that out.
Look,

1225
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:30,683
I'm two months from the election away 
from the election and then at least six 

1226
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:36,290
months reputation,
right?

1227
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,650
At least if I met,
that's probably low,

1228
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:39,484
but mark nine put anytime this is,
this is something to play until next 

1229
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,010
September,
right?

1230
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,300
At earliest.
Right.

1231
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:48,700
The earliest thing coming to play is 
next September.

1232
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,590
I hope it's that fast.
That'd be amazing.

1233
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,690
I hope it is that fast,
but it isn't five minutes.

1234
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,050
It's like up.
I'm not doing this so I can become king.

1235
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,360
We already have a king and that's why 
we're in trouble.

1236
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,140
Right?
Right.

1237
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:02,020
I want to give localized control many 
more options.

1238
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:03,263
I'm a,
I'm the crazy guy who actually means 

1239
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,330
what he says.
When I say let teachers teach,

1240
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,463
I actually mean that most people say it 
and then they and their response then 

1241
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:16,170
becomes give more administrators.
So you think what's stopping them now?

1242
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:20,740
Standardized tests and administrators 
and then funding.

1243
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:24,370
That's based on the success of the test.
That's correct.

1244
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:26,890
In the school district it's correct.
The answer is always more funding.

1245
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,220
The is always more funding

1246
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,730
and it isn't.
It is not that people always say we have

1247
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:33,930
to fund fund fund.
That is not the answer there.

1248
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:36,020
There are better answers out there.
Of course there are.

1249
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,700
My main done,
let me go to the,

1250
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,280
to another piece on how to raise money.
Okay.

1251
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,410
The first thing is of course,
as I mentioned,

1252
00:50:42,411 --> 00:50:44,150
get more people.
If more people show up to the state,

1253
00:50:44,151 --> 00:50:45,770
New York state could,
in theory,

1254
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:46,813
and this is theory,
easily hold 30 million people if they 

1255
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,420
the state could.
It's possible how many done the city?

1256
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:55,610
Seven is about eight and a half in a 
city to say right now,

1257
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,680
but I didn't happen to see right now,
but that's a lot.

1258
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,573
It is a lot.
It's the largest city in the country by 

1259
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:01,220
far.
It's,

1260
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,260
it's over double a Los Angeles,
Los Angeles,

1261
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:04,730
about three and a half,
not mistaken.

1262
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,330
Went down sort of La.
There's no end to it.

1263
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,201
Yes.
Well,

1264
00:51:09,201 --> 00:51:11,640
if about LSD,
look at the metro area of,

1265
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:14,390
of New York state,
and New York City's had 16 million metro

1266
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:15,230
areas,
60 million.

1267
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,160
The actual city itself is a half.
So it's,

1268
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:20,030
it's by far the largest city in the,
uh,

1269
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:21,290
in the nation.
So yes.

1270
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,840
So it could in theory,
take 30 million people.

1271
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:26,540
It's possible if we get that amount of 
people,

1272
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:27,570
oh my God,
the,

1273
00:51:27,571 --> 00:51:29,200
the tax revenue would be insane.
Right?

1274
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:32,420
But you can get people to move to New 
York state by having a better state.

1275
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:33,860
And one of the things I mentioned was 
education,

1276
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:34,970
but there are several other things you 
can do.

1277
00:51:34,971 --> 00:51:35,804
First of all,
why aren't we supporting small 

1278
00:51:36,891 --> 00:51:37,724
businesses?
And we don't know is that we punish 

1279
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:39,531
them,
right?

1280
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:40,970
We punish them.
But with licensing,

1281
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:42,380
we punished him.
In New York state,

1282
00:51:42,381 --> 00:51:44,030
there's actually a licensed to braid 
hair.

1283
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,800
There's a license to walk a dog.

1284
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,140
There's all kind of license.
The license to walk her dog.

1285
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:49,003
Correct?
Yes.

1286
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,750
It's involved in that.
I don't know.

1287
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:52,360
I'm not a dog walker.
No,

1288
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:54,170
no.
There should be none here.

1289
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,020
Here's my rule and licensing.
I got a good,

1290
00:51:56,021 --> 00:51:57,020
nice,
good general rule.

1291
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:00,550
Would you ask your friend to do it?
If you were a,

1292
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:01,384
a a woman who had lots of long hair,
would you ask your friend to braid your 

1293
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:06,350
hair?
You probably would when you probably,

1294
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,213
Yep.
Probably would.

1295
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,130
If you had a dog and if you have a dog,
but assuming you have a dog,

1296
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,270
would you ask your friend to walk your 
dog?

1297
00:52:11,271 --> 00:52:11,841
Sure,
sure.

1298
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:14,060
Of course you would.
Why is their license for that?

1299
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,490
Would you ask your friend to remove your
appendix?

1300
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:21,530
But I think the idea would be that you 
wouldn't want someone to screw it up,

1301
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:22,364
so we'd want to make sure someone has 
insurance so that the consumer doesn't 

1302
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:25,880
get ripped off.

1303
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,990
Yes.
But the,

1304
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,660
the appendix and you wouldn't let them.
Yeah.

1305
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:29,563
Good license for that.
I'm fine.

1306
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:30,740
Right.
Get a license for that.

1307
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,960
But your point's a valid one.
How about instead?

1308
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:35,420
There's a difference between licensing 
and what you just said,

1309
00:52:35,421 --> 00:52:39,740
which is insurance difference.
Licensing says the government decides if

1310
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:44,000
you can or can't do it and if you don't,
the government will find you and or jail

1311
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:45,470
you.
That's a license.

1312
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,710
So you don't have to have hair braiding 
insurance or dog walker insurance.

1313
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,360
You might want to have insurance.
I didn't say that.

1314
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:51,770
I said license.
There is a difference.

1315
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,600
Right?
The assumption is,

1316
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:54,434
and you've made it by make that step.
You made the assumption which is 

1317
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,150
licensing is for safety.
It is not that.

1318
00:52:59,151 --> 00:53:00,900
It's full control.
It's all it's for.

1319
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,860
The example I'll give you is vaping in 
New York state,

1320
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:05,420
many calories you have to have a license
for vaping.

1321
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,970
So what does it likes his intestines to 
sell?

1322
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,621
Yes.
To sell that.

1323
00:53:08,621 --> 00:53:09,660
A vaping store?
Yes.

1324
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:11,120
Have that because have to have a 
license.

1325
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,540
They have a vaping store similar to that
of having a tobacco store similar.

1326
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:15,141
Right,
right.

1327
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:16,310
They do that.
So you might say,

1328
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:17,340
well,
vaping a licensed,

1329
00:53:17,341 --> 00:53:18,650
it's grades for safety.
Right?

1330
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,560
Well does the person who has done the 
vaping shit thought maybe,

1331
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:22,394
I don't know,
learn CPR or understand the effects of 

1332
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,870
nicotine in the body?
No.

1333
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:30,930
They have to write a check if a lot of 
form.

1334
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:32,543
That's it.
There's no safety involved that the 

1335
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:37,500
license is approved for license.
That's correct.

1336
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,370
They can't be a felon with a history of 
fraud.

1337
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,530
I'm not sure if that's even the case in 
[inaudible] the main thing,

1338
00:53:43,531 --> 00:53:45,450
I don't think that's true.
I think in vaping that's not true.

1339
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,310
In certain cases there are.
That's true in certain,

1340
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,770
but this is one tobacco controlled 
substance.

1341
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,693
It is.
So I would assume that they do have to 

1342
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:52,554
have a license based on not being a 
felon for tobacco prep until about 

1343
00:53:55,281 --> 00:53:56,150
vaping.
Vaping is,

1344
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,930
no,
it is not.

1345
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,400
It's not.
No,

1346
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,810
not at all.
Not Tobacco,

1347
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:01,770
right.
Some is.

1348
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:02,604
Some is not.
So the stuffing is basically a is 

1349
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:06,540
though.
Isn't that a controlled substance?

1350
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:07,250
No.
No,

1351
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,280
no.
Nicotine.

1352
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:11,130
I don't think it is.
I don't think it is.

1353
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,090
Hmm.
Tobacco was,

1354
00:54:12,091 --> 00:54:17,091
I know that's hilarious.
If tobacco itself is the point,

1355
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:18,143
active ingredient isn't.
The point of all of this is why is any 

1356
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:26,310
of it controlled and why is vaping 
controlled?

1357
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,030
If you're talking about safety and this,
let me go to safety.

1358
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:32,730
I'm glad you brought this up.
Safety.

1359
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,430
Everyone will tell me.
W W will tell me,

1360
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:36,600
well,
licensing is for safety.

1361
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:38,580
Regulations is a for safety.
They're not.

1362
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,020
They're not,
they're not.

1363
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:41,640
And then I'll give you the best example 
I can give you.

1364
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:42,923
Health food stores,
the healthiest people you know shop at 

1365
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:47,304
health food stores.
There is almost one is a health food 

1366
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:50,334
store.
It's a store like a store where you 

1367
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:53,520
might go and buy vitamins that are not,
that,

1368
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:58,550
that's not GNC or store where you might 
go and purchase organic things.

1369
00:54:58,651 --> 00:55:01,860
That's not a regular food.
Not a whole foods.

1370
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,550
Whole foods is similar,
but the mom and pop health food store,

1371
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:08,220
which generally speaking is usually 
privately owned.

1372
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,110
Usually it's kind of his thing from the 
past,

1373
00:55:10,111 --> 00:55:11,520
isn't it?
Health food store.

1374
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:12,923
Yeah.
I say that because most people 

1375
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:16,830
understand what I mean when I say that,
but if you did not,

1376
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,270
I apologize.
But most people do understand.

1377
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,104
When I say hopefully,
I mean basically a local store that was 

1378
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:23,520
some things like vitamins and it will 
sell things like supplements.

1379
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,430
It'll be,
it's like a GNC is often,

1380
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:29,010
often it's a mix of like a GNC and 
grocery store,

1381
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,860
usually owned by an individual,
but not always our family,

1382
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,000
but then kind of store.

1383
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,000
Those stores are almost not regulated at
all.

1384
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:36,834
I mean probably 90% of their products 
have no FDA approval because of there's 

1385
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:43,080
no FDA approved for supplements.
Correct.

1386
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:46,260
So there's just a stamp that says not 
approved by FDA.

1387
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:49,110
Right.
Most of their products are um,

1388
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,011
most of their,
their,

1389
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:50,611
their,
their,

1390
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:51,444
their products are just out there.
Where are all the deaths from health 

1391
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:57,150
food stores?
There aren't what health,

1392
00:55:57,151 --> 00:56:00,450
food stores have our standards,
lots of standards,

1393
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,313
tons of standards.
Now some people buy certain products 

1394
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:04,374
because they believe in them.
Some people buy certain bras because 

1395
00:56:05,551 --> 00:56:07,950
they believe in the brand name up to 
them.

1396
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:10,020
Some maybe go to certain stores that 
trust those stores.

1397
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,760
It's fine.
It happens all time.

1398
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,020
It's just,
it's a standard.

1399
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:14,603
What would happen if,
say there was a health food store or 

1400
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:16,944
even a GNC or any place like that and 
there was a supplement that if he took 

1401
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:21,204
that supplement and uh,
most people who took it will get 

1402
00:56:23,471 --> 00:56:24,790
addicted and do crazy things.

1403
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,530
And that came out to the news.
Look,

1404
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,350
here it is.
If you take xyz product,

1405
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,520
you'll probably go crazy or do something
not so whatever happened,

1406
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,870
they removed them.
You know,

1407
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,150
things like that's correct.
Fuel those away.

1408
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,350
Yes,
that's exactly my point.

1409
00:56:39,351 --> 00:56:40,810
To kill you.
Thank you.

1410
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,003
It goes away.
There's actually repercussions and it 

1411
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:45,190
goes away.
Right,

1412
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,110
and maybe there's a lawsuit,
maybe not,

1413
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:49,930
but it goes away.
What if it's FDA approved?

1414
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,770
Nothing happens.
80% of all of our addicts,

1415
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,050
FDA approved drugs,
nothing happens.

1416
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:00,100
When it's a government monopoly from by 
a government regulatory body,

1417
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,400
there's no repercussions.
It just keeps killing us.

1418
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:04,263
Well,
that's certainly still feel 

1419
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:05,910
pharmaceutical interest.
Yes.

1420
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,023
Slowly.
It just keeps killing us on and on and 

1421
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,070
on and on.
If you want things to be safe,

1422
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,880
then let's focus on safety.
Not Focus on control,

1423
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:20,500
so I want products to be safe,
not controlled.

1424
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,180
Controlled is useless,
so make them safe.

1425
00:57:23,181 --> 00:57:25,420
They're safe.
I'll use a health food store examples,

1426
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,190
for example,
how about competing standards?

1427
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:28,803
Standards that are competing.
I don't have a problem with the 

1428
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:31,744
government saying these are the 
standards we believe have the 

1429
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:36,310
appropriate standards to be safe.
They should do that.

1430
00:57:36,311 --> 00:57:38,050
Absolutely.
A practice is a choice.

1431
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,123
Take the stamp or not.
The the only exception is why they 

1432
00:57:42,341 --> 00:57:44,960
punishing you.
If you choose not to see what it does.

1433
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:48,070
It's of innovation with government 
stamps.

1434
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:48,963
Not at all,
but it has to be something that is 

1435
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,170
voluntary.
It's correct.

1436
00:57:53,171 --> 00:57:55,330
The person who owns the store and buy 
the consumer.

1437
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,673
Now,
how do what my example I give is this 

1438
00:57:58,481 --> 00:57:59,950
water?
I would probably has it.

1439
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:00,611
Yes,
it does.

1440
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:02,800
It has that circle you the circle.
You.

1441
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,420
Do you know what that means?
No.

1442
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,400
It's the Orthodox Union,
right?

1443
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:07,270
I'm live in New York.

1444
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,010
City's a very high Jewish population,
New York City.

1445
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:09,844
I'm in a Jewish friends,
and the Orthodox Union means it's a 

1446
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:12,610
kosher product.
Oh,

1447
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:14,230
so their water's kosher.
This water's kosher?

1448
00:58:14,231 --> 00:58:15,064
Yes.
How does it become kosher to bless 

1449
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,630
blessing.
There's the issue.

1450
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:18,610
I don't know the circle you on it.
You know?

1451
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:19,563
So if,
if you're Jewish and you care about 

1452
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:22,534
keeping a kosher household,
you would buy this product because you 

1453
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:25,330
trust the circle.
You.

1454
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,290
Is this kosher?
I don't know.

1455
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,130
But the person that buys it believes it 
and buys it.

1456
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:30,993
And what if they found out this was the 
water was not kosher then that'd be a 

1457
00:58:33,641 --> 00:58:34,260
problem.
That'd be it.

1458
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,000
Then there'd be some kind of backlash.
Well,

1459
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:37,893
as a person who is a partner in a 
supplement company and also someone who 

1460
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:42,754
works for the UFC who hasn't,
the UFC has giant issues with people 

1461
00:58:46,511 --> 00:58:47,670
taking tinted supplement.

1462
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:48,503
Sure.
There's third party independent 

1463
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,530
verification,
third independent testing.

1464
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,080
Absolutely.
Really good supplement companies like on

1465
00:58:56,081 --> 00:58:56,914
it and many others use where you can 
find out that you don't have tainted 

1466
00:59:00,551 --> 00:59:01,810
supplement.
Absolutely.

1467
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:04,600
I'd rather have that than how about we 
had those stamps on.

1468
00:59:04,601 --> 00:59:06,430
Products are like that.
Yes,

1469
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,293
I had the stamps and if you have a 
government that have that and guess 

1470
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:10,240
what,
maybe you want 4 cents,

1471
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,103
maybe want the government stamp plus 
third party stamp plus authoritarian 

1472
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:14,263
stamp.
Well what I liked was the side business 

1473
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,593
does third party independent company 
absolutely has their own personal 

1474
00:59:20,471 --> 00:59:22,010
standards and you know when there

1475
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,440
are really good company you can rely 
upon them.

1476
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:25,850
Yes.
And if you don't,

1477
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:29,060
you could have competing standard 
multiple companies because you trust one

1478
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:31,190
company more than the other or you want 
both.

1479
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:34,070
Is that possible solution for education,
a third party,

1480
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:37,220
independent verification of the 
education system.

1481
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:39,140
We've been here for what about an hour 
or so?

1482
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:41,090
And you already gave a good idea.
Yes,

1483
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:42,080
exactly.
My point.

1484
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,480
That seems like a good idea to me.
There we go.

1485
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:45,523
Yeah,
there should be some effective school 

1486
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:51,170
system that works and then they take the
people that run that effective of school

1487
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,004
system and they have a curriculum and a 
way of doing things that they could 

1488
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,330
perhaps uh,
you know,

1489
00:59:56,331 --> 00:59:57,164
teach other other school systems.
That's the idea of transparency and 

1490
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:00,800
accountability.
That's the whole point.

1491
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:03,350
So this is the deal with people that are
libertarian,

1492
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:04,184
right?
The idea is that you are a free market 

1493
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:06,704
person and that you believe in the free 
market and you believe in less 

1494
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:09,920
government.

1495
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,750
I believe in the consumer,
right?

1496
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,460
I believe in the consumer.
And then Jennifer,

1497
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:18,010
the pool and things are consumer driven.
And this is not hundred percent role.

1498
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,750
Government isn't always wrong.
It's often wrong.

1499
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,760
But not always.
Right,

1500
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:24,170
and the consumer isn't always right,
but often,

1501
01:00:24,171 --> 01:00:26,030
right.
So as a general role,

1502
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:29,390
consumers tend to drive things better.
Like as I said,

1503
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:30,224
kosher water like supplements.
If you don't allow the consumer to 

1504
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:35,420
decide,
you by default stifle innovation,

1505
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,733
you just stifle innovation.
You stifle everything new because if it 

1506
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:42,920
can't get through the FDA that it can't,
it almost can't be done.

1507
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,310
And you have centralized control that's 
very difficult to get past.

1508
01:00:46,311 --> 01:00:47,750
You got it.
Exactly right.

1509
01:00:47,751 --> 01:00:51,200
Or not really motivated to improve or to
no end to the opposite.

1510
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,053
They're,
they're actually incentivized to make 

1511
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:56,810
sure nothing goes wrong.
So always err on the side of no,

1512
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,530
no.

1513
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,620
It becomes the rule of no one meaning 
everything is about,

1514
01:01:00,621 --> 01:01:02,750
no,
there's no one's job to make it work.

1515
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:05,480
This is my point on the education 
system.

1516
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,470
The job there has to be someone who's,
who says,

1517
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,650
we have to make this thing work.
I'm the guy who says that I want to make

1518
01:01:12,651 --> 01:01:14,990
it work.
Let's make this thing work.

1519
01:01:14,991 --> 01:01:15,824
Let's just not make sure things go bad.
Let's make sure that things actually 

1520
01:01:19,251 --> 01:01:20,360
work.
Now,

1521
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:24,020
you obviously know far more about New 
York politics than I do.

1522
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:24,854
I know very little about it,
but one thing that I do know is it's 

1523
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:29,630
almost universally regarded as being 
insanely corrupt.

1524
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,493
True.
You get to a position where you become 

1525
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:32,960
the governor.
Yup.

1526
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,740
How do you clean up that fucking 
hornets?

1527
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:38,690
Yes.
The one thing people always say is,

1528
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,770
Lara,
you got to clean it up.

1529
01:01:39,771 --> 01:01:40,460
Like you just said.

1530
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,170
It's funny you use that.
I think I hear all the time.

1531
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,660
You got to get these guys in jail.
You got to punish them.

1532
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:48,710
Whatever I ran,
we talk about that and the reason is,

1533
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,570
okay,
you put some guy in jail,

1534
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:52,010
you punish him.
Whatever the case may be.

1535
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:52,844
Great.
Who's family came back from North 

1536
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,090
Carolina?
Who's kick I that education?

1537
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,880
Who got a better job?
Whose taxes went down?

1538
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,490
Who's happier,
whose business didn't go under?

1539
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:02,653
No one's helped by people going to jail.
We feel righteous and then we pack up 

1540
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:07,550
and move to North Carolina.
I mean,

1541
01:02:07,551 --> 01:02:10,370
this is not the right answer.
North Carolina is beautiful.

1542
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,160
It is and that's another problem.
It is.

1543
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:15,110
You go there,
it's all green and it is people,

1544
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,810
it's grave or not to have it a little 
Twang to the way they talk.

1545
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:18,783
Barb can,
it's pretty fucking good to try to make 

1546
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:20,010
sure

1547
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,450
a bunch of New Yorkers don't go there 
and ruin it.

1548
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:23,340
Say I understand.
I understand.

1549
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,410
That's keeping New York,
keeping New York.

1550
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,330
Um,
I want to keep them all in New York.

1551
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,190
So my,
my point being,

1552
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,040
um,
I forgot my point now.

1553
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,541
Um,
I don't know.

1554
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:36,890
Your point by point of corruption,
getting rid of the jail,

1555
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:38,880
the goal is not to just put people in 
jail.

1556
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:40,140
The goals make a better system.
Right.

1557
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:41,003
Well,
I'm not really even interested in 

1558
01:02:41,461 --> 01:02:43,980
putting them in jail.
What I'm interested in is figuring out a

1559
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:46,050
way to stop corruption.
Several things.

1560
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,360
The first thing,
first of you can't stop corruption.

1561
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:52,530
You can absolutely lessen it and you can
catch it fast that you can do,

1562
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,510
you can make less corruption and catch 
it fast.

1563
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,080
Then you remember,
is the average person who is about to do

1564
01:02:58,081 --> 01:03:00,630
something which may or may not be 
unethical or maybe corrupt?

1565
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:01,663
Is it thinking,
I wonder if I'll get five years or 10 

1566
01:03:03,901 --> 01:03:05,220
years?
They just thinking,

1567
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:06,263
will I get caught?
It's all the thinking about will I get 

1568
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:09,810
caught and will my be over?
Right.

1569
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:10,763
So several things.
The one I went less opportunity for 

1570
01:03:12,781 --> 01:03:15,060
someone to be caught.
What does that mean in New York state?

1571
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:18,960
Less money coming from Albany,
which is our capital less money.

1572
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,670
The less money the governor has to give 
out,

1573
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,650
the less chance that there'll be 
corruption.

1574
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,420
That's number one.
But on top of that,

1575
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:25,403
New York state is filled with boards and
committees and authorities and things 

1576
01:03:30,211 --> 01:03:32,820
that the governor creates to make other 
things happen.

1577
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,073
We'll create this authority to make this
happen and this commission to make that 

1578
01:03:35,971 --> 01:03:38,160
happen.
And then he appoints all of his cronies,

1579
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,023
all of his buddies onto these,
onto these commissions and boards and 

1580
01:03:41,491 --> 01:03:43,710
such.
Now he now has one step away,

1581
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:48,630
but he is raised over $800,000 for his 
campaign for people he's put on boards.

1582
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,280
So he gets lots of money for these 
people,

1583
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:51,690
rewards them up,
putting on boards,

1584
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:54,780
and then they become corrupt.
If you've noticed that your politics,

1585
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,790
many people have been indicted,
arrested,

1586
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,624
convicted,
almost every one of them is either on a 

1587
01:03:59,581 --> 01:04:04,581
board or a commission or authority.
Trashing those is a huge part of getting

1588
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:05,594
a corruption.
Getting me what we have in New York 

1589
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:07,464
state.
We have regional economic development 

1590
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:09,234
corporations.
These are basically with the government 

1591
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:13,380
decides where the money goes to develop 
areas.

1592
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:14,423
Yes.
The government decides where to develop 

1593
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,760
areas.
You mean any gap jump?

1594
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:19,620
Yes.
Yes.

1595
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,600
Well,
we're going to put money into whether it

1596
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:24,060
can be infrastructure,
building a hospital,

1597
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,570
putting a new downtown in all these 
types of things,

1598
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,880
so who would then,
how about the local,

1599
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:31,980
the local people,
the local government.

1600
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:33,330
The mayor,
absolutely.

1601
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:34,164
Why not?
Okay.

1602
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:37,170
Need the government.
You have a be the local,

1603
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:39,600
local and local less as something else.

1604
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:42,870
How about just like bankers who want to 
invest in things,

1605
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:45,510
businessmen who think this is a good 
idea.

1606
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:49,320
How about the local woman who thinks 
this is a great place for it opened up a

1607
01:04:49,321 --> 01:04:52,020
whole new business.
How about the guy or Gal who thinks this

1608
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,420
is a great place for a new school as 
opposed to what it is now,

1609
01:04:54,421 --> 01:04:56,910
which is we all that petition to the 
government.

1610
01:04:56,911 --> 01:04:58,800
I'm not joking.
We think we should.

1611
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:59,783
The government then agrees,
blesses it gives us a certificate of 

1612
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:04,140
need and then says here's the government
money to build this thing.

1613
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,110
That is completely the wrong answer.
Right.

1614
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,180
But then it's going to be some 
regulation.

1615
01:05:09,181 --> 01:05:13,020
Like you don't really want a nightclub 
opening up right next to us and we go,

1616
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:14,940
there's gotta be some regulations gene,
that guy's,

1617
01:05:14,941 --> 01:05:15,820
there should be.
Yeah,

1618
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,950
of course I did that.

1619
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,640
At what point did I say destroy 
everything?

1620
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,610
Well,
I'm not saying you have ever said that,

1621
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:25,590
but I'm asking you if there should be 
some regulation based assays.

1622
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:29,680
If I'm arguing to control,
not I based upon safety,

1623
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,520
not control safety.
If it is based upon safety,

1624
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,600
I'm in.
Right.

1625
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,700
Like a scroll would be right next to a 
strip club.

1626
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,040
Is that safety right?
Is it?

1627
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:39,940
Yeah,
I would think so.

1628
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,350
Then I'm okay with it.
I'm not sure that's true.

1629
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:42,280
I really,
I don't know enough about that,

1630
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:43,510
but if that safety,
I'm okay.

1631
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:45,580
It's not safe for those kids.
Then there we go.

1632
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,850
Some of those girls then that,
then I'm fine with that and have,

1633
01:05:48,851 --> 01:05:50,710
I don't have a problem if it's based 
upon safety,

1634
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:51,893
but just because,
just because I decide I don't like this 

1635
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,230
thing here.
Right.

1636
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:58,023
If someone was stability or the ability 
that if the community doesn't want it 

1637
01:06:00,131 --> 01:06:02,590
there as a general rule,
the community doesn't support it.

1638
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:03,483
What's the main argument against 
libertarian philosophy when you fear 

1639
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:08,140
fear.
Fear.

1640
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:09,760
Fear of change.
Fear.

1641
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:12,010
Fear of not having big brother and 
control.

1642
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,140
Remember something in New York,
I mean New York.

1643
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:17,140
In America in general,
as a general rule in America,

1644
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,290
the government does not just take our 
rights as a general rule,

1645
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:22,720
we eagerly vote them away because we're 
afraid.

1646
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:26,050
I'm afraid take my rights,
I'm afraid.

1647
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:28,390
Take my rights.
That's what usually happens.

1648
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,000
Fears of problem,
which is why as you've said will,

1649
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:31,834
there'll be no regulation.
There are a lot of libertarians who 

1650
01:06:33,581 --> 01:06:34,540
probably heard that and went,
yeah,

1651
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:36,730
Larry say no regulation.
I'm not going to,

1652
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:37,683
and here's the reason why.
If I decided to pull the rug out from 

1653
01:06:39,881 --> 01:06:41,410
people,
they will be afraid.

1654
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:45,160
People who are afraid make bad decisions
all the time.

1655
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:48,070
The word that I'd use more here,
and maybe it's not landing,

1656
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:50,020
maybe this is my error for not making 
this land better,

1657
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,093
is facilitate.

1658
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:55,810
I want to facilitate better options.
I would facilitate better answers.

1659
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:58,840
I'm not just going to go to school.
Some may say take away the money,

1660
01:06:58,841 --> 01:06:59,674
go away.
That would create fear and bad 

1661
01:07:01,961 --> 01:07:03,730
decisions.
What would you do instead?

1662
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:04,564
I would say in x number of months,
the federal government regulations and 

1663
01:07:08,711 --> 01:07:11,140
the federal government dollars are going
to go away,

1664
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:13,190
which means by this time we're not going
to have it,

1665
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:14,770
which means that only do you not have 
the money,

1666
01:07:14,771 --> 01:07:16,930
but also you don't have these 
restrictions.

1667
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,333
How can we fix this system to win so you
don't have district restrictions 

1668
01:07:20,951 --> 01:07:23,260
anymore?
What can you make to be better,

1669
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,280
stronger,
faster?

1670
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:26,440
How can we do this now let's talk this 
thing out.

1671
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:27,483
Some people will fight me.
Of course some people will not make a 

1672
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:31,390
change of course,
but some will go,

1673
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:32,770
oh my God,
thank you so much.

1674
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:33,603
Yes,
I would much rather not spend the money 

1675
01:07:35,231 --> 01:07:36,310
here,
but I'd rather spend it here.

1676
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:37,151
Okay,
let's try that.

1677
01:07:37,151 --> 01:07:37,984
Let's do that and before the others will
follow and then others will follow and 

1678
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:43,030
that might take a year or two.
It might take three years.

1679
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,313
But what will happen,
we'll have a much better effective 

1680
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:50,040
system and when one fails,
but hopefully,

1681
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,660
hopefully none yet because it hasn't 
been done before.

1682
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,430
Okay.
It's been done in everything.

1683
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:56,800
We'll give you the best example I can 
give you with education with,

1684
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,300
I'll give you the best of,
I can give you.

1685
01:07:58,330 --> 01:07:59,710
Okay.
Um,

1686
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:01,360
google,
google,

1687
01:08:01,361 --> 01:08:01,930
Google.
Yes.

1688
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:04,870
Google had a program and I think they 
still have it.

1689
01:08:04,871 --> 01:08:06,310
I'm sure someone will let me know if 
they don't,

1690
01:08:06,311 --> 01:08:08,700
but I believe they do to where you had 
an um,

1691
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,740
an employee could choose to take 20% of 
their,

1692
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:15,380
their work time and do it on any project
they wanted to,

1693
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,600
any project,
whatever they want to do.

1694
01:08:17,601 --> 01:08:19,100
Did you work on if they want to do it 
was voluntary.

1695
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,900
You didn't have to just do your regular 
workload if you want it to,

1696
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,480
but if you wanted to be like 20% and 
work on anything you want,

1697
01:08:23,481 --> 01:08:24,314
whatever you think is appropriate.
The only rule was you have to be 

1698
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:28,790
transparent and you're accountable to 
your team what you did.

1699
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Again,
in uh,

1700
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,390
freedom plus transparency plus 
callability.

1701
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:32,991
Right,
okay.

1702
01:08:32,991 --> 01:08:33,824
And was that many of the people did 
things mindup up doing things that 

1703
01:08:36,231 --> 01:08:37,850
didn't really work very well,
but when they did it,

1704
01:08:37,851 --> 01:08:39,320
they said,
hey joe,

1705
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:40,730
I went and tried this thing.
It didn't work.

1706
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:42,860
You might have tried it too.
You learn something,

1707
01:08:42,861 --> 01:08:44,060
figured things out,
made it better.

1708
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:47,060
But a bunch of their most profitable 
things,

1709
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,510
profitable applications came from this.
Now what I actually want,

1710
01:08:50,511 --> 01:08:53,720
I'm happening also is some people that 
20% some people weren't even more,

1711
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:55,730
let's get more work out of some people.

1712
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:56,563
They have more innovation out of people 
because they were doing stuff they 

1713
01:08:58,111 --> 01:09:00,470
wanted to do.
Now does everyone take it?

1714
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:01,304
No.
Some people just did their own work and 

1715
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:03,920
we're happy with her work at their 
salary moved on,

1716
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,473
but what happened is you got innovation 
and other people learn from it and it 

1717
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:11,030
became better and better and better.
That happens all the time.

1718
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:12,143
All the time.
That is a very different system than 

1719
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:17,630
talking about the education system.
When you're talking about Google,

1720
01:09:17,631 --> 01:09:18,464
you're talking about people that are 
hired to make money for a mega 

1721
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:21,794
corporation that makes billions and 
billions of dollars and you give them a 

1722
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:27,170
chance because they're engineers and 
techies,

1723
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:30,020
you give them a chance to innovate.
They innovate,

1724
01:09:30,021 --> 01:09:33,320
but their financial incentive is 
massive.

1725
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:34,243
I mean,
I have differential instead of hasn't 

1726
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,400
changed,
and who's a big executive at Google?

1727
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:39,240
They make a shitload of money.

1728
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,073
Absolutely.
The people that work underneath them 

1729
01:09:42,051 --> 01:09:42,884
have the potential to move up that 
corporate ladder to show none of this 

1730
01:09:44,841 --> 01:09:46,610
financial incentive in the school 
systems.

1731
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:49,490
That's not only that you're limiting 
their amount of money.

1732
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:54,140
You're not just offering them the 
possibility to exchange creative ideas.

1733
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:54,974
You're saying we're going to give you 
less money and we're going to have the 

1734
01:09:57,321 --> 01:10:00,290
administrators who are still going to be
in a position of power.

1735
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,333
You're going to have that.
Everyone's going to have to figure this 

1736
01:10:02,721 --> 01:10:03,790
out.
All right.

1737
01:10:03,791 --> 01:10:05,840
This is not,
this is not a parallel situation.

1738
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:07,010
Absolutely is.
Let me tell you why.

1739
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:07,863
Parallel situation a wide is the first 
thing is the people who get into 

1740
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:13,130
teaching,
they don't get in because my God,

1741
01:10:13,131 --> 01:10:15,710
I'll make millions of dollars.
They don't do that.

1742
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:19,460
They get into it because they think it's
a viable career path for them.

1743
01:10:19,461 --> 01:10:20,630
They have skill at it.

1744
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,910
They enjoyed doing it and they want to 
make a difference.

1745
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:24,200
All those things.
Yes,

1746
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:25,760
that's correct.
If you're lucky,

1747
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:26,630
if you,
if,

1748
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:28,460
if everyone's lucky,
that's what they do it for.

1749
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:30,200
Well,
the same thing with Google,

1750
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:31,070
right?
Does everyone go there?

1751
01:10:31,071 --> 01:10:32,180
Cause I'm gonna make tons of money.
No.

1752
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,073
A lot of them didn't show.
And a lot of teachers go there because 

1753
01:10:34,341 --> 01:10:35,450
they don't make a difference.
Yes.

1754
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:36,463
So the incentive you women,
I don't think anybody's going to google 

1755
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,250
because they want to make a difference 
in how teachers,

1756
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,390
teachers,
yes,

1757
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:43,660
while there,
but somehow they're parallel.

1758
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:46,190
Something you want to go to muscle,
giant business.

1759
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,270
How many,
how many?

1760
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:48,103
One of the biggest businesses in the 
world and the New York City in New York 

1761
01:10:50,391 --> 01:10:51,224
state schools,
a system and say 60 billion odd 

1762
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:55,520
business,
still a bunch of money.

1763
01:10:55,521 --> 01:10:58,310
It's not profitable.
That's the same thing.

1764
01:10:58,660 --> 01:10:59,493
The same thing by any stretch of the 
imagination and it's certainly not 

1765
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:02,324
profitable for the individuals that are 
involved in this innovation that you 

1766
01:11:04,641 --> 01:11:07,610
seek and I think you are wrong in many 
ways.

1767
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:12,020
How am I wrong that it's not profitable 
for the individuals that you're asking?

1768
01:11:12,021 --> 01:11:15,540
You are assuming because we lose $4 
billion.

1769
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:18,870
You're assumption is that means teachers
don't get more money.

1770
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:21,570
That's your assumption.
She was going to get more money.

1771
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:24,780
If you're giving them less money.
I'm not keeping teachers less money.

1772
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,410
You're giving the school last month.
That's correct.

1773
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:29,060
School district class money.
Teacher's not going to get less money.

1774
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,080
Schools get more less money.
Well,

1775
01:11:31,081 --> 01:11:32,370
what if you got rid of,
I don't know,

1776
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,890
a bunch of administrators?
What if you got rid of,

1777
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:35,743
you would have to,
who would decide that these 

1778
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:38,064
administrators are removed?
Don't know how many times I've got to 

1779
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,000
say this.
You never said anything clear.

1780
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:43,560
That's why I'm asking you over and over 
and over again.

1781
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:45,390
This is not clear.
Okay?

1782
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:47,160
You're saying it's going to work itself 
out.

1783
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,020
Yes,
we're going to facilitate it,

1784
01:11:49,021 --> 01:11:52,110
but then you comparing this to google 
when you're giving people who are making

1785
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:53,820
a fantastic salary.

1786
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,950
Yep.
The ability to innovate for 20% of their

1787
01:11:55,951 --> 01:11:56,820
time.
Sure.

1788
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,713
I don't think,
I don't think these are valid 

1789
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:01,050
comparison.
Humans are humans.

1790
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:02,423
We want to have purpose.
We want to do better at whatever we're 

1791
01:12:05,911 --> 01:12:06,744
doing.
We want tap accolades from those who 

1792
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,320
respect.
That's what humans want.

1793
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:11,213
Okay?
I agree.

1794
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:13,830
No matter what humans want that if 
you're a teacher,

1795
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,260
you want accolades from those you 
respect.

1796
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,213
You want to be good at what you do.
You also want to be able to feed your 

1797
01:12:19,261 --> 01:12:20,094
family.
You also want to be able to make a 

1798
01:12:20,881 --> 01:12:24,120
living.
So in most of them make piss poor money.

1799
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,680
All right.
This is an Oklahoma,

1800
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:27,420
it's New York state,
right?

1801
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:32,220
So most of them are doing well enough to
not starve it down.

1802
01:12:32,221 --> 01:12:34,390
How much did I make?
How much show how my teacher makes it?

1803
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:37,800
Didn't you just get done saying how 
expensive it is to live in New York?

1804
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:39,720
It is expense.
Taxes are outrageous.

1805
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,310
It's outrageous.
Absolutely.

1806
01:12:41,311 --> 01:12:42,780
We're moving out in droves.
It's true.

1807
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:43,883
And then there's going to be less money 
for people that already get paid less 

1808
01:12:46,741 --> 01:12:49,890
than they should.
That not saying that's true.

1809
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:50,993
Your saying that's true,
but there's going to be less money that 

1810
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:53,850
goes to the school,
goes to a school district.

1811
01:12:53,851 --> 01:12:54,684
Yes.
So how was that not going to translate 

1812
01:12:57,481 --> 01:12:59,550
into less money that goes to the 
teachers and less.

1813
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:00,970
I will try it again.
How?

1814
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:01,280
No,
no,

1815
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,550
no.
You've never said it.

1816
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:03,563
Tell me what he wanted me to say.
No one has decided how this is going to 

1817
01:13:06,721 --> 01:13:08,250
somehow know the benefit.
The teachers,

1818
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:08,960
yes,
but you've,

1819
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,340
you've,
you've not firing these administrators.

1820
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:13,380
You're making everybody figured out on 
their own.

1821
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:16,020
The administrators will wind up being 
fired.

1822
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:18,270
They will by WHO,
by what?

1823
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:19,960
The PTA.
I'm some PDA.

1824
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:22,050
The at the school boards,
they will begin to it.

1825
01:13:22,051 --> 01:13:22,884
You're going to,
it's going to happen.

1826
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,720
We're going to facilitate the way out.
It's going to happen.

1827
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:26,220
You know,
if you,

1828
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:27,083
if you want me to say there are 700 
school districts and I'm going to fire 

1829
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:32,130
that guy,
that guy,

1830
01:13:32,131 --> 01:13:33,150
that guy,
that guy,

1831
01:13:33,151 --> 01:13:33,984
that guy,
and I'm literally two months out from 

1832
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:39,600
the election and then at least nine 
months middle mentoring it.

1833
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:42,330
You're simply asking too much of me just
asking too much of me.

1834
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,690
The skeleton is built.
The idea is good.

1835
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:48,270
It will work when we fill out,
of course we will.

1836
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,390
Absolutely.
How am I going to which guide a fire and

1837
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:53,760
I'm a year out from doing this,
basically asking much of me.

1838
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:55,170
It's,
it's an unfair question.

1839
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:56,483
It's an unfair question.
I'm not asking you which particular 

1840
01:13:58,291 --> 01:13:59,124
human being defier.
I'm asking you how you're going to 

1841
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:02,274
facilitate paying less money to the 
school districts and somehow or another 

1842
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:07,883
having them organize the right way to 
make the school runs smoother and more 

1843
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:17,050
efficiently while you're comparing it to
people who work at a multibillion dollar

1844
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:17,884
tech company where you're allowing 
engineers who get paid substantial 

1845
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:24,340
amounts of money to innovate for 20% of 
their time.

1846
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,173
And I was saying that these,
this is not a valid comparison and I'm 

1847
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:27,904
saying you're incorrect cause they,
both human humans want to be good at 

1848
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:34,540
what they want to be.
The reality of it is,

1849
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:35,613
as I said earlier,
a lot of school districts won't do much 

1850
01:14:37,691 --> 01:14:38,524
different at all,
but there will always be early adopters 

1851
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:41,074
that happens in everything.
They will always be early adopters and 

1852
01:14:44,201 --> 01:14:46,780
some people will jump in and go,
this is a wonderful idea.

1853
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,360
Let's start working on this now.
And some will,

1854
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:50,283
some sort just,
we'll do absolute nothing and they will 

1855
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:53,560
think Larry was going to fail.
Who Cares?

1856
01:14:53,561 --> 01:14:55,330
Let's change nothing.
Of course.

1857
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:58,570
And probably most will do absolutely 
nothing once I'm elected.

1858
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,300
Nothing but a bunch of going to say,
oh my God,

1859
01:15:01,301 --> 01:15:02,134
what an awesome thing this is.
And they'll begin making changes right 

1860
01:15:03,821 --> 01:15:06,190
away and as they do,
we'll start watching,

1861
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:06,940
oh,
what do you,

1862
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:07,773
what are you proposing?

1863
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:09,700
What's the right way?
That sounds great.

1864
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,860
What do you think?
What do you think?

1865
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,180
As I said,
my business guy,

1866
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,340
I go in,
I,

1867
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:16,300
I've,
I've been an officer in a public company

1868
01:15:16,301 --> 01:15:17,134
for short periods.
I'm twice and in both cases when I went 

1869
01:15:18,731 --> 01:15:19,780
in,
I didn't go and going,

1870
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,040
ew,
ew,

1871
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:22,030
ew,
ew.

1872
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,490
That's TV show stuff.
It's not how it works.

1873
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,040
How it works is you walk in,
you talk to people,

1874
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:30,100
you begin to figure out what's going on.
You try new things until the right thing

1875
01:15:30,101 --> 01:15:32,380
works.
That's how you fix a business.

1876
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,990
And if you know anyone who does it,
they'll tell you that's how you do it.

1877
01:15:34,991 --> 01:15:36,340
You don't walk and go,
I know everything.

1878
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,600
So it works well.
Let me,

1879
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:40,300
let me come at you from a position of 
fear.

1880
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:41,223
Please.
Let's pretend that I'm a parent and I'm 

1881
01:15:42,731 --> 01:15:46,870
hearing this plan and I'm thinking,
this is not a plan.

1882
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:47,733
You're eliminating money.
What if my school system doesn't figure 

1883
01:15:51,371 --> 01:15:53,710
out a way to innovate?
Would if they cut funding,

1884
01:15:53,711 --> 01:15:58,711
would have the kids classes get bigger?
What if there's just a just a mass panic

1885
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:02,470
throughout the organization because you 
essentially gutted their infrastructure.

1886
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:04,930
Wow.
I gutted their infrastructure.

1887
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,750
I really hope they don't believe that.
But they might your right.

1888
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:10,810
That would be if I was your opponent.
That's absolutely what I would argue.

1889
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:11,703
Sure,
and I guess you could argue that if you 

1890
01:16:12,491 --> 01:16:14,170
wanted to,
here's my response.

1891
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,170
Okay.
Keep the same system,

1892
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:22,450
keep paying your same taxes,
keep your kids unhappy,

1893
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:23,523
sue the state,
and you can pack up and move to South 

1894
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:28,003
Carolina this time.
Is it North Carolina or Tennessee 

1895
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,120
instead of North Carolina,
Florida.

1896
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,370
Cause your hat going move if you want 
to.

1897
01:16:33,371 --> 01:16:35,710
That is an option for you.
If I was your opponent,

1898
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:38,470
I would say that is a ridiculous 
proposition.

1899
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:43,470
So you're saying either we keep the 
current system or we adopt your system.

1900
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:45,303
These are the only two options.
We either leave or we take your option 

1901
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,850
and Nope,
you're would say,

1902
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:55,300
why don't you throw more money at these 
teachers?

1903
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:59,950
Give them more incentive to succeed,
figure out a way to take money away from

1904
01:16:59,951 --> 01:17:00,784
something else and apply it to education
because we believe that it is the least 

1905
01:17:04,361 --> 01:17:05,194
appreciated thing that is the most 
important because we've been doing that 

1906
01:17:07,751 --> 01:17:09,710
for 20 years and failing.
That's why.

1907
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,660
Yes,
they've been paying teachers more.

1908
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:12,943
Nobody had been throwing more money at 
the system with for 20 years to hiring 

1909
01:17:16,611 --> 01:17:18,620
administrators.
They've been throwing my,

1910
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:20,750
we've been doing it for 20 years.
It hasn't worked yet.

1911
01:17:20,751 --> 01:17:22,610
When are you gonna stop?
That's my response.

1912
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:25,850
We've been doing it for 20 years,
at least throwing.

1913
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:26,743
We spend more money per kid than 
California does and we have worse 

1914
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:32,144
results.

1915
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:36,650
If you're happy with that system,
awesome Volk Cuomo,

1916
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:38,540
you'll get it.
You'll keep it,

1917
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:41,720
no worries.
But if you actually want change,

1918
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,390
if you're unhappy with the system,
you got to change it.

1919
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,790
And they said to my system with people 
all the time,

1920
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,530
what I'm doing right now,
I think the same thing.

1921
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:49,423
Yeah,
but I haven't even prepared and I'm 

1922
01:17:50,481 --> 01:17:52,190
finding all these problems with it.
Does he ever,

1923
01:17:52,191 --> 01:17:54,800
you haven't given me one prom at all.
I haven't given you any problem.

1924
01:17:54,801 --> 01:17:56,870
What have you heard me say?
Not One you just said,

1925
01:17:56,871 --> 01:17:57,441
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid.

1926
01:17:57,441 --> 01:17:58,970
I'm afraid not.
It's not what I said.

1927
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,980
That's what I heard.
That's I haven't said it.

1928
01:18:00,981 --> 01:18:02,990
I'm afraid.
Never said that once.

1929
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:05,360
You said,
but what if but what if but what if,

1930
01:18:05,361 --> 01:18:08,300
but one last what if questions.
It's not saying I would says I'm afraid.

1931
01:18:08,301 --> 01:18:08,540
I'm afraid.

1932
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:09,920
I'm afraid.
That's what I hear.

1933
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:15,370
But what if is asking you to define how 
your system is going to succeed?

1934
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:19,670
It's not saying I'm afraid that's 
hyperbole.

1935
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:22,840
Didn't you just say if I'm,
if maybe I'm,

1936
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:25,700
maybe I didn't hear you correctly,
but then you just say,

1937
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:29,130
but what if this bad thing happens?
What if it's my school district went,

1938
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:34,390
what I did is I had an exercise where 
I've made a parent who was scared.

1939
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,290
I didn't say,
that's me.

1940
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:40,040
And I'm telling you as a person who's 
not debating you,

1941
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:41,780
I'm just asking you questions about 
this.

1942
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:43,430
Please.
I'm curious,

1943
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:44,463
but I see massive flaws in the logic 
behind allowing these systems to figure 

1944
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:53,150
out how to eliminate administrators in 
order to stay alive with less money.

1945
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:57,890
I'll try it again.
I'm facilitating this to make it happen.

1946
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:00,050
I'm going to oversee it.
Of course.

1947
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:00,943
There's already administrators in,
in at Albany who can help to facilitate 

1948
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:04,310
these.

1949
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:07,700
I understand what you've said and you 
can repeat it at nauseum.

1950
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:08,534
I'm just curious about it,
but it seems very loosely defined and 

1951
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:13,100
it's very,
would agree with you.

1952
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,890
I don't think it's confusing at all.
Loosely defined is true.

1953
01:19:15,891 --> 01:19:17,450
It's a skeleton and it's a good 
skeleton.

1954
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,700
Well,
it's confusing in the fact that you have

1955
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:23,000
these administrators and they're in this
position where you're going to eliminate

1956
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:25,970
some of them,
but you don't know how many or which way

1957
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:26,983
or how to do that and you're going to 
allow the PTA and the teacher's unions 

1958
01:19:29,961 --> 01:19:32,180
to figure this out or not the teachers 
union,

1959
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:33,860
but whoever would be just to be part of 
it too.

1960
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:34,371
Of course.
Look,

1961
01:19:34,371 --> 01:19:36,380
you used to be part of it.
PTSB part of it.

1962
01:19:36,381 --> 01:19:37,214
School boards be part of it.
Of course Albany's administrators to be 

1963
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:42,230
part of it.
Of course it you can't,

1964
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:43,183
you can't do a long term solution for 
any problem by just dictating what is 

1965
01:19:47,931 --> 01:19:48,764
right and what is wrong.
I agree with you more worried about the 

1966
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:51,704
short term consequences are the ones 
that are going to vote for you or not 

1967
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:56,030
vote for it?
Probably not though.

1968
01:19:56,031 --> 01:19:57,680
For me.
My assumption is not built for me.

1969
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,570
Right.
Yeah.

1970
01:19:58,570 --> 01:19:59,690
I'm with you.
I think most,

1971
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:00,733
most people who are afraid of that,
who think the way you're presenting to 

1972
01:20:04,011 --> 01:20:05,390
me,
most of them are not gonna vote for me,

1973
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:08,070
but you've got to play devil's with 
yourself when

1974
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,860
you're going over these things and is 
what I know for sure.

1975
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,990
There are a bunch of people who are not 
going to vote for me.

1976
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:15,960
I'm okay with that.
I'm still right.

1977
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,480
It's the right answer.
Whether I win,

1978
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:19,314
lose or draw,
everything I'm saying is true and right 

1979
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:24,060
and there is no better alternative in 
New York state period.

1980
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:25,163
No other,
every other person who's running is 

1981
01:20:27,061 --> 01:20:29,550
saying we have to fund more fun,
more fun,

1982
01:20:29,551 --> 01:20:31,800
more.
That's not going to work.

1983
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:32,753
That I'm sure of,
and anyone who knows the system also 

1984
01:20:34,681 --> 01:20:37,770
knows that it is impossible that funding
more's going to work.

1985
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,880
That's correct.
Why is that?

1986
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:40,140
Because you're not changing the system 
itself.

1987
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:41,723
You still just have a bunch of teachers 
being told you're goal is high test 

1988
01:20:45,631 --> 01:20:48,930
scores in standardized testing.
That's your goal.

1989
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:51,750
That's how you're funded.
That's how you're judged.

1990
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:54,360
That's how you decide if you're going to
stay a teacher or not.

1991
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,120
That's everything.
That's the current system.

1992
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:59,400
And there's no opposition to that other 
than you.

1993
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:00,690
That is correct.
Yes.

1994
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:05,580
So everyone else wants the people that 
are doing the best to get more money.

1995
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:08,130
The people that do school systems,
no,

1996
01:21:08,131 --> 01:21:08,400
no,
no.

1997
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,233
They judge them by standardized testing,
but they're doing the best and now 

1998
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:15,900
they're not doing the best.
Whoever's getting the best scores.

1999
01:21:15,901 --> 01:21:16,734
Thank you.
Those are the ones that are getting the 

2000
01:21:17,161 --> 01:21:17,911
most money.
Correct.

2001
01:21:17,911 --> 01:21:19,440
The people that are doing the best.
Yes.

2002
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:20,281
Now,
not to be the best,

2003
01:21:20,281 --> 01:21:23,470
best scores.
The scores don't mean to me.

2004
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:25,440
Well,
they mean something.

2005
01:21:25,441 --> 01:21:27,750
You take a test,
so I mean,

2006
01:21:27,751 --> 01:21:29,850
it means something.
It means you're going to taste tech.

2007
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:33,690
You're better at the test and the 
publisher of the best tests.

2008
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,560
Correct?
Yeah,

2009
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:35,430
but,
but,

2010
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:39,660
but test taking standardized test taking
is no indication of success.

2011
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,730
What is a good indication of success?

2012
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:44,130
Emotional intelligence.
But you can't measure that.

2013
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,470
And the emotional intelligence,
yes,

2014
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,640
but that's not going to work for some of
his goals.

2015
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:50,220
Right?
Um,

2016
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,340
but if you're teaching kids,
how do you,

2017
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:55,950
how do you judge whether or not you're 
doing a good job,

2018
01:21:56,910 --> 01:21:58,410
you know,
other than tests,

2019
01:21:58,411 --> 01:21:59,244
how would you judge as an example,
how do you judge things when they're 

2020
01:22:03,091 --> 01:22:03,924
hard to judge?
And I bring this up in my business 

2021
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:06,391
often,
right?

2022
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:07,500
When you can't,
when it,

2023
01:22:07,501 --> 01:22:09,450
things aren't,
when it's not easy to find a win,

2024
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,070
right?
If I don't know what a win is,

2025
01:22:11,071 --> 01:22:14,670
how do I figure out what a win is?
Sometimes can be challenging,

2026
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,863
right?
Um,

2027
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:16,740
if you're,
uh,

2028
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:20,550
if you own a something a company,
you might judge it on sales,

2029
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,650
which is a lot easier,
but you might not,

2030
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,420
you might,
you might judge on or something like,

2031
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:25,141
you know,
um,

2032
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:25,974
how many of your competitors,
how many of your customers are a 

2033
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:29,574
professional athletes?

2034
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:30,690
You might judge it or something like 
that.

2035
01:22:30,691 --> 01:22:33,090
You could find another way of judging it
if you felt the appropriate,

2036
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,073
depending upon what you thought was a 
win or valuable the syndicate happen in 

2037
01:22:37,231 --> 01:22:38,064
schools,
you could judge it by simply how many 

2038
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:42,250
parents are happy and you could judge 
them by,

2039
01:22:42,251 --> 01:22:43,590
uh,
how many show up.

2040
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,240
You could judge them by having an 
actual,

2041
01:22:45,241 --> 01:22:49,440
a rating system similar to how Google 
writes things or yelp rates things.

2042
01:22:49,441 --> 01:22:51,800
There's many ways you could jut getting 
system to help.

2043
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:53,880
Well,
you could in theory shorts,

2044
01:22:53,881 --> 01:22:54,714
another option of course.
But how would you be able to figure it 

2045
01:22:56,011 --> 01:22:56,844
out?
Like fi spell this out for me but I 

2046
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:02,910
don't,
what's your question?

2047
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:05,630
You're saying a rating system for kills.
You can,

2048
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:09,140
it minute.
You could be a parent's judge.

2049
01:23:09,141 --> 01:23:12,640
The school could be the teachers do a 
three 60 on themselves,

2050
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:14,410
right,
and many businesses are three 60 I don't

2051
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:15,230
know if you know if that means,
I'm sorry.

2052
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:16,450
I'm sorry.
It's a business thing.

2053
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,990
Sometimes what'll happen is in a,
in a business,

2054
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:21,093
how you judge the individual is you do 
what's called a three 60 and people who 

2055
01:23:24,131 --> 01:23:28,000
are around that person will judge them,
usually anonymously.

2056
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:33,150
So person may be has seven juniors,
seven peers and three or four seniors.

2057
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,383
They'll pick a couple of juniors,
a couple of peers and a couple of 

2058
01:23:36,431 --> 01:23:37,264
seniors who will then grade this person.
It's called a three 60 and now that 

2059
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:43,710
person gets graded every six months or 
every year or depending upon the company

2060
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:44,663
every quarter and now you know how the 
person is doing because everyone around 

2061
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:50,140
them is judging him or her.
So the teachers are judging each other.

2062
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:51,250
They could do that too.
Sure.

2063
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,680
You're asking me for specific plan.
Could be,

2064
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:54,514
I think these are all viable plants.
What I'm saying is can be a combination 

2065
01:23:57,220 --> 01:24:01,720
of viable alternative to testing to find
out how well children are doing.

2066
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:03,910
It could be only thing you should write.
How about graduation rate?

2067
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,310
I like that too.
Graduation rate could work,

2068
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:07,144
but it's a great way.
By what standard are they graduating if 

2069
01:24:08,921 --> 01:24:11,260
they're not taking tests and I said,
I've taken tests.

2070
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:13,880
They're not taking standardized tests.
We're going to take standards.

2071
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:16,540
That's what I said.
So taking some tests of course.

2072
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:19,180
So you're judging them by these tests?
It's correct.

2073
01:24:19,181 --> 01:24:20,980
And letting me teach standardize.
That is correct.

2074
01:24:20,981 --> 01:24:23,860
That's why I said difference between the
tests that you would judge them on.

2075
01:24:23,861 --> 01:24:24,694
And standardized test.
Standardized test is usually given by 

2076
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:28,144
federal or state authorities.
It's usually written someplace out of 

2077
01:24:30,851 --> 01:24:31,684
state.
It's usually decided based upon the 

2078
01:24:33,581 --> 01:24:34,414
company that bids the right bid and it 
doesn't necessarily decide what's 

2079
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:39,130
important to the local kids.
Also the parents.

2080
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:42,820
So what would be the difference and the 
test teachers are,

2081
01:24:42,821 --> 01:24:44,350
these teachers would have their own 
tests,

2082
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:49,720
so there would be no standard that the 
state would enforce.

2083
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:52,240
They would all be up to the community.
Sure.

2084
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:55,030
Love the idea.
I love the idea.

2085
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,910
Let's let the school districts create 
their own tests and the odds are they'll

2086
01:24:57,911 --> 01:25:00,490
wind up copying each other most of the 
time anyway.

2087
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,900
That's fine.
You see what works.

2088
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,930
The issue is you're assuming that a 
standardized test has value.

2089
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:06,460
I don't,
I'm not gonna assume me.

2090
01:25:06,461 --> 01:25:07,294
A standardized test has value.
I'm just asking you what would the 

2091
01:25:08,651 --> 01:25:10,570
alternative to a standardized test will 
be?

2092
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:14,150
Is is a,
is a district wide test district.

2093
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,170
What's wrong with that?
Standardized for the district.

2094
01:25:17,171 --> 01:25:18,004
The district.
I'll take back.

2095
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,151
Sure.
Much better.

2096
01:25:19,151 --> 01:25:20,680
Why would that be better than for the 
state?

2097
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:21,663
Because each,
each school district is different 

2098
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:27,880
because each,
because each county in New York state is

2099
01:25:27,881 --> 01:25:29,890
different.
Each region is different.

2100
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:33,160
They're just physically,
socially,

2101
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:34,690
they're just,
they're different regions.

2102
01:25:34,691 --> 01:25:36,370
So there's sort of different standards.

2103
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:38,110
Sure.
In terms of how they graduated,

2104
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:39,543
what an a is and what's a pass,
how you get through school and with 

2105
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:49,300
that,
would it be even across the board?

2106
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,091
I mean,
would you,

2107
01:25:50,091 --> 01:25:51,940
would you know what you mean by that?
It wouldn't be better.

2108
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:52,953
Would you have schools that will be be 
worse and they would all have the same 

2109
01:25:54,851 --> 01:25:56,230
grains?
Look,

2110
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:59,080
if you wanted to,
I think you could easily create a system

2111
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:02,590
to where at the end of the day,
meaning at the end,

2112
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:03,573
at the end,
meaning 16 in this case where I'm 

2113
01:26:04,461 --> 01:26:05,294
talking to k through 10 at a k through 
10 where there is one statewide 

2114
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:09,224
standardized test,
which is why I said no standardized 

2115
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:12,520
testing until high school.
Right,

2116
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:13,663
so prior to high school,
I don't want standardized testing at 

2117
01:26:17,331 --> 01:26:19,820
high school.
I'm fine with it at that point,

2118
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:20,654
the kids a bit more mature,
the kids kind of know where they're 

2119
01:26:22,491 --> 01:26:23,840
going,
the Senate,

2120
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:26,120
it have more value for them in that 
regard because they'll know,

2121
01:26:26,121 --> 01:26:26,954
wait a minute,
I'm doing standardized testing because 

2122
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:31,040
I'm thinking do I want to go to college,
do I want to go to prep school?

2123
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:35,150
Do I want it to trade school 
standardized testing in high school.

2124
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,350
This is where I said,
okay,

2125
01:26:36,351 --> 01:26:38,510
so for 14 to 16 basically just two 
years.

2126
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:39,470
That's correct.
Yes.

2127
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,633
In those areas.
I'm totally happy with that because at 

2128
01:26:42,651 --> 01:26:43,484
that point the kids are deciding where 
they want to go and being a good test 

2129
01:26:45,681 --> 01:26:47,540
taker in those years might make you 
think,

2130
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:49,790
you know what,
maybe I'm good for sciences,

2131
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:52,460
maybe I'm good for math,
maybe I should be a plumber,

2132
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:55,490
maybe I should be a truck driver.
Maybe I should be an insert thing here.

2133
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,660
Right.
Maybe for a teacher.

2134
01:26:56,930 --> 01:27:01,170
So I'm totally happy in high school.
So I said until high school doing in the

2135
01:27:01,171 --> 01:27:03,860
youth doesn't do anything except make 
things bad.

2136
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:05,593
So once we get to the high school level,
yeah there's standardized testing at 

2137
01:27:07,971 --> 01:27:10,010
that point.
But I'm saying before that,

2138
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,340
but before that is when the kids are 
building up who they are.

2139
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:16,730
Right before that was when the kids are 
building up who they are as,

2140
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:17,743
as students,
as as who they think they are in their 

2141
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:19,874
life.
Are you familiar with other types of 

2142
01:27:21,531 --> 01:27:26,531
teaching like wall door for some of the 
other alternative forms of education and

2143
01:27:27,130 --> 01:27:30,670
have you ever looked at those models and
no,

2144
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:31,790
I have not.
Not Teacher.

2145
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:33,410
Yeah,
I have not.

2146
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:36,380
But I'm happy to to look at those too.
I'm happy to look at them.

2147
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:37,253
If those are,
if those are models that would give our 

2148
01:27:40,581 --> 01:27:43,310
kids an upper hand and a better chance 
of success,

2149
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:45,560
I would happily take them.
If they are,

2150
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:47,180
I'm happy to.
I'm happy to do that.

2151
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:48,643
To be fair with you,
as I'm trying to tell you everything 

2152
01:27:50,721 --> 01:27:54,200
you're saying right now in the 
conversation we've had in the past,

2153
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,033
hour and a half,
you've already come up with some 

2154
01:27:55,071 --> 01:27:56,420
different ideas in such already you 
have,

2155
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:58,670
can you imagine what teachers were doing
was they had this,

2156
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:00,920
the concepts and ideas they would come 
up with.

2157
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,160
We can facilitate things actually 
working maybe even by region,

2158
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:07,130
maybe even by county,
maybe even counties that would test.

2159
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:08,063
Even test schools.
Schools have a test things out for a 

2160
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:10,873
year.
You imagine even that teachers have the 

2161
01:28:12,441 --> 01:28:17,441
kind of freedom to innovate and I mean 
in any foreseeable future like that,

2162
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:18,800
yes.
Decide,

2163
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:21,510
decide some of the things that we've 
talked about now,

2164
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:24,440
third party certifications and trying to
figure out.

2165
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:25,910
Absolutely,
yes.

2166
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:29,690
What you're hearing me say?
What you have so many people get afraid.

2167
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:31,190
Not saying you are,
but many people do.

2168
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,353
If some talking about an actual revamp,
a reboot of our education system where 

2169
01:28:35,871 --> 01:28:36,704
you're talking about change,
radical change because my state is 

2170
01:28:39,591 --> 01:28:43,280
collapsing and I understand that radical
change.

2171
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:44,143
Yes.
Do you think it's collapsing or do you 

2172
01:28:45,531 --> 01:28:47,540
think the current numbers are just 
unsustainable?

2173
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,150
Is there a difference?
Yeah,

2174
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:51,050
the differences.
It will still maintain,

2175
01:28:51,051 --> 01:28:52,130
but there'll be less people.

2176
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:56,180
It's not collapsing.
Collapsing to me seems like it's falling

2177
01:28:56,181 --> 01:28:56,960
apart.
Yes.

2178
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,640
That's what I say.
I think there's a lot of people that are

2179
01:28:58,641 --> 01:29:00,080
in New York that are like,
Holy Shit,

2180
01:29:00,081 --> 01:29:01,620
this is too much.
I gotta Outta here.

2181
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:02,543
Which in my eyes tells me that it's 
cloud because you have situation where 

2182
01:29:04,891 --> 01:29:07,110
you have counties that are one third 
have Medicaid,

2183
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:08,153
one third of Medicare with a,
a bunch of unfunded mandates that force 

2184
01:29:12,121 --> 01:29:12,954
them to pay for certain things and with 
people leaving you have a dwindling tax 

2185
01:29:16,291 --> 01:29:17,850
base.
So at that point,

2186
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:19,500
yeah,
that's collapsing.

2187
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:23,850
At what point does it stop?
I don't see it stopping.

2188
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:26,670
I just see larger chunks of Medicaid,
Medicare,

2189
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:30,750
and at one point when it's Medicare,
even they pack up and head to Florida,

2190
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:33,090
North Carolina or South Carolina,
right?

2191
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:34,223
Families are keeping people in New York 
state more than anything because their 

2192
01:29:36,931 --> 01:29:37,950
relatives or close by.

2193
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:39,570
Yes.
So now if they're not,

2194
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:40,703
if so,
I see it's continuing education out of 

2195
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:45,120
the equation.
So if we've got education cured,

2196
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:47,940
how do you make amazing,
be amazing.

2197
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,073
How do you make it more attractive for 
people to stay in New York that don't 

2198
01:29:52,711 --> 01:29:53,920
have children,
Yadda,

2199
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:56,130
you make it more attractive to 
businesses?

2200
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,170
Absolutely.
Several things.

2201
01:29:58,290 --> 01:29:59,150
Number one,
we,

2202
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,033
as I said before,
we have to raise money through ways 

2203
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:02,520
other than taxation,
right?

2204
01:30:02,521 --> 01:30:03,354
We can still raise money.
We can find ways to fill gaps and if we 

2205
01:30:06,091 --> 01:30:06,924
have to fill a gap,
say the 4 billion from the federal 

2206
01:30:07,981 --> 01:30:09,030
government,
we have to fill the gap.

2207
01:30:09,031 --> 01:30:11,670
If we find that the first six months of 
discussion,

2208
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:14,550
there's no way we can do this without 
the forebay Nelson,

2209
01:30:14,551 --> 01:30:15,570
the federal government,
let's say.

2210
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,433
Let's say I'm wrong.
Let's say I'm wrong and the 4 billion 

2211
01:30:19,441 --> 01:30:21,900
now is I want to get rid of from the 
federal government is no,

2212
01:30:21,901 --> 01:30:22,734
we have to have it that we,
the plans you've come up with that we 

2213
01:30:24,151 --> 01:30:24,870
think will work.

2214
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:25,703
What card?
That money.

2215
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:26,693
Okay.
Deal.

2216
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:28,200
I got it.
We can still raise it some other way.

2217
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:29,363
Now.
In the past we've done things very 

2218
01:30:29,881 --> 01:30:31,350
poorly in New York state.
We've done things like,

2219
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,930
let's have a lottery and a lottery.
We will pay for education.

2220
01:30:33,931 --> 01:30:35,760
Then it goes off to the general fund and
it goes away.

2221
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:37,470
We can do,
is that something like this?

2222
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,950
I talk often about using our 
infrastructure in New York state.

2223
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:42,173
As we of raising money,
we have bridges and tunnels and through 

2224
01:30:45,621 --> 01:30:46,454
ways and the Erie canal,
which is about a 500 miles and about 

2225
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:50,670
three dozen locks and lots of stuff like
that.

2226
01:30:50,671 --> 01:30:51,504
Right?
Why in the world do we have a bridge 

2227
01:30:52,651 --> 01:30:53,484
right now in New York state that's named
after one of our previous governors 

2228
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:58,350
called the Mario Cuomo bridge.
That's embarrassing.

2229
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,770
We literally have an,
uh,

2230
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:01,230
uh,
an imperial bridge.

2231
01:31:01,231 --> 01:31:02,280
Neva throw royal family.

2232
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:04,000
That bridge should not be named that 
there,

2233
01:31:04,001 --> 01:31:06,570
but she'd be the staples bridge,
the verizon bridge,

2234
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,250
the a,
the three m bridge,

2235
01:31:08,251 --> 01:31:10,650
the Kellogg's bridge,
the Apple Bridge,

2236
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:11,513
whatever.
We should be leasing the naming rights 

2237
01:31:12,871 --> 01:31:14,400
out.
I'm a business guy.

2238
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:16,470
Want to retain the asset.
We don't lose the asset.

2239
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:17,730
Lisa naming rights out,
right?

2240
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,880
These are companies that pay billions of
dollars every year in marketing.

2241
01:31:20,881 --> 01:31:21,714
Old Time,
they dropped $20 million for a a a a 

2242
01:31:25,441 --> 01:31:28,940
stadium that gets used on the weekends.
Instead we have them pay a,

2243
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:29,783
how'd it make dollars for bridge?
That's across by hundreds of thousands 

2244
01:31:31,741 --> 01:31:33,930
of cars every single day.
So you call it the verizon,

2245
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:35,100
the rise of rich.
Love it.

2246
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,173
Perfect.
And it's mentioned hundreds of times 

2247
01:31:38,491 --> 01:31:42,210
every single day during rush hour in a 
16 million person metro area.

2248
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,770
But here the next piece is on top of 
that.

2249
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:44,933
Once he has the money,
they're also responsible for the 

2250
01:31:46,411 --> 01:31:48,420
maintenance.
We used to inspect the bridge,

2251
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:49,020
right?

2252
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:51,570
People say [inaudible] is responsible 
for that is correct.

2253
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:52,500
That's part of it.
Yes.

2254
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:54,870
So they have to pay you and they have to
fix the bridge.

2255
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,070
They can go,
yes.

2256
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:57,223
That's all I know is I already have 
already asking me about how long is the 

2257
01:32:00,911 --> 01:32:01,701
lease?
What are we gonna do?

2258
01:32:01,701 --> 01:32:02,680
They already love it.
Yes.

2259
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:03,903
People already tell him,
know that you want them to fix it to 

2260
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:05,980
correct.
Yes,

2261
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:08,320
absolutely.
But be part of the contract again,

2262
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,393
I don't have to.
And this is a common theme that you'll 

2263
01:32:11,441 --> 01:32:13,510
find that people don't like and you 
didn't,

2264
01:32:13,511 --> 01:32:15,040
you don't seem to like it either,
which is,

2265
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:17,830
I don't have the answer for exactly what
the contract is.

2266
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:19,540
I'm not saying I don't like and I'm just
saying,

2267
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:21,130
man,
if I was verizon I'd be like,

2268
01:32:21,131 --> 01:32:21,964
Shit.
So Yang you guys just to put my name on 

2269
01:32:23,981 --> 01:32:24,070
it.

2270
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:25,380
Now I've got to fix this.
Yes,

2271
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,350
there may be.
You know what,

2272
01:32:26,351 --> 01:32:28,000
if you don't want to,
maybe we negotiate.

2273
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:30,580
You pay a little bit less pain,
90 million instead and fix the bridge.

2274
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:31,503
But I want you fixing the bridge and 
there's a reason why she fixing the 

2275
01:32:33,221 --> 01:32:37,330
bridge right now across our country,
but just collapse concrete cancer.

2276
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:38,920
They,
they all old time.

2277
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,873
Right?
And,

2278
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:41,800
and why?
Because the government has to run it and

2279
01:32:41,801 --> 01:32:44,020
the government runs out of money or drop
Rossi fails.

2280
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,400
Right.
But in this case,

2281
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:50,530
we would actually have someone who has 
to fix it so we could actually check the

2282
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:53,240
bridge and to say it's at at a b and an 
a diesel.

2283
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:54,580
Osa can get to as an example,
right.

2284
01:32:54,581 --> 01:32:56,510
Has to be,
verizon refuses to fix it.

2285
01:32:56,511 --> 01:32:57,344
It goes to see rice and fix it.
Now you lose a contract and I guess now 

2286
01:32:59,951 --> 01:33:00,784
it's gonna be a sprint bridge.

2287
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:02,200
Right?
They have to fix it.

2288
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:03,483
The British who actually gets fixed,
that makes sense to not even know what 

2289
01:33:05,261 --> 01:33:06,270
that is.
So yeah,

2290
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:07,090
that's,
that's one.

2291
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:07,923
Right?
So immediately at that point we're 

2292
01:33:08,831 --> 01:33:11,800
getting money.
The bridge are actually getting fixed.

2293
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,840
And here's the best part,
the need for tolls.

2294
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:17,620
If you've been through New York state,
you know we are the toll monsters.

2295
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:19,900
I mean we are horrible.
It's brutal.

2296
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:20,734
Yes.
When a tree establish those tolls under 

2297
01:33:22,211 --> 01:33:24,310
the false premise of once the bridge is 
paid,

2298
01:33:24,311 --> 01:33:25,960
got it.
Correct.

2299
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:28,450
Once they got addicted to that money,
he said,

2300
01:33:28,451 --> 01:33:29,830
well,
we're never paying this bitch off.

2301
01:33:29,831 --> 01:33:31,090
That is correct.
Yes.

2302
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:32,163
So instead they now know it's creepy,
which means now those truckers that are 

2303
01:33:35,111 --> 01:33:37,600
paying a hundred bucks every,
every time across that breaks,

2304
01:33:37,601 --> 01:33:39,880
they pay by the axle.
Those go away.

2305
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:42,820
This isn't a $100 every time they cross 
the bridge for a big truck.

2306
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:43,693
A trailer.
Yeah.

2307
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,880
Cause they paid per axle dirty.
Yes.

2308
01:33:45,881 --> 01:33:47,680
It's horrible.
That is so dirty.

2309
01:33:47,681 --> 01:33:50,170
They're paying tons of money every time 
across that bridge.

2310
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:52,600
And if that goes away to see if you 
could do that,

2311
01:33:52,601 --> 01:33:54,810
you would when the governor,
I would hope so.

2312
01:33:54,811 --> 01:33:57,840
If you could figure out how to do that,
you would become governance.

2313
01:33:57,841 --> 01:33:59,770
It's already be this.
The idea is not crazy.

2314
01:33:59,771 --> 01:34:00,604
We already have a doppler.
They ever brought this up besides you 

2315
01:34:02,111 --> 01:34:04,150
never,
we already have adopt a highway.

2316
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:06,250
Fuck your education system.
This shit would work.

2317
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,370
See that?
I got you on that one away.

2318
01:34:08,371 --> 01:34:09,530
So all right,
so I'll tell you what,

2319
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:10,750
we're working on.
This one.

2320
01:34:10,751 --> 01:34:11,590
I said,
but here's a better,

2321
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:12,424
but not even done yet.
Not only at their paying for 

2322
01:34:13,631 --> 01:34:14,464
maintenance,
which means we have lower spending 

2323
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:17,050
because we're not paying for 
maintenance.

2324
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,273
And his even better part,
the less money I have to give out for 

2325
01:34:21,011 --> 01:34:21,844
these contracts,
less corruption because I'm not giving 

2326
01:34:24,161 --> 01:34:25,000
out the contracts anymore.

2327
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,880
Verizon's given car.
How much money do they get though in the

2328
01:34:27,881 --> 01:34:32,020
tolls over a year.
I would imagine it'd be bigger than $100

2329
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:32,380
million.
Um,

2330
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:33,850
no it isn't.
It's not.

2331
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:35,020
No.
Yes it is.

2332
01:34:35,021 --> 01:34:35,530
I'm sorry.
Yes,

2333
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:36,970
the tolls.
I'm sorry.

2334
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:38,020
I'm thinking of billions.
Yes,

2335
01:34:38,021 --> 01:34:40,300
because the New York state budget,
I was like a billions.

2336
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:41,051
I apologize.
Yes,

2337
01:34:41,051 --> 01:34:42,480
it's not $100 billion,
but it's several days.

2338
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,590
I think just New York City,
if I'm not mistaken,

2339
01:34:44,591 --> 01:34:46,540
there's over 2 billion,
2 billion a year in tolls.

2340
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:47,403
Just know he's dead is so dirty.
But that may include people you can't 

2341
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:54,760
drive unless you give us money.
You want to cross this line?

2342
01:34:54,761 --> 01:34:57,130
Pay Attacks.
Pit Tariff.

2343
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:58,030
Yes.
Oof.

2344
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:00,050
That's so gross.
It's tons of money.

2345
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:03,350
We're so lucky here in California,
so we could raise that money.

2346
01:35:03,351 --> 01:35:05,360
So to make you see,
I'll make your education unhappy.

2347
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:05,810
I'll,
I'll,

2348
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:08,690
I'll take four being off of that.
I'll put it back in the teachers and the

2349
01:35:08,691 --> 01:35:10,610
money's the same.
Well how you're,

2350
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,473
if you're taking that,
let me again and said I did not love 

2351
01:35:13,881 --> 01:35:15,770
you.
I was just finding holes in your game.

2352
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:18,770
Now when you're,
when you're talking about the holes,

2353
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:20,600
don't be silly.
No holes there.

2354
01:35:20,601 --> 01:35:21,860
Don't be silly.
This isn't halls there.

2355
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:22,910
No,
come on.

2356
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:23,893
Come.
So when you take away all that money 

2357
01:35:25,671 --> 01:35:28,640
that people are paying on the toll is $2
billion a year.

2358
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:29,780
How do you replace that?

2359
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:34,260
I they're paying $2 billion in young 
hungry.

2360
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:37,400
If we're getting $100 million from one 
bridge,

2361
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:38,960
that's just one bridge.
Okay.

2362
01:35:38,961 --> 01:35:39,794
How many bridges you got?
There's over a dozen just in New York 

2363
01:35:41,931 --> 01:35:42,501
City,
Justin,

2364
01:35:42,501 --> 01:35:44,120
the MTA.
And I didn't even,

2365
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,233
I didn't even count the Erie Canal.
That's 36 locks would get named each 

2366
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:50,720
lock,
repair the entire Erie Canal.

2367
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:54,800
Make it commercially viable without 
paying any tax payer dollars whatsoever.

2368
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:55,853
And we had McDonald's could own one.
They put Mcdonald's on every single log 

2369
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:59,420
lock.
These are for,

2370
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:00,860
um,
commercial boats.

2371
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:01,450
Yeah.
Well,

2372
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:03,230
we can make whatever we want.
Right now.

2373
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:06,430
The Erie canal is run by the parks and 
rec switch it.

2374
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:09,230
It costs us about a hundred million 
dollars every year,

2375
01:36:09,231 --> 01:36:11,720
including capital projects to maintain 
the Erie Canal.

2376
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:12,673
We make less than 5 million.
Have you crunched all the numbers on 

2377
01:36:14,751 --> 01:36:17,810
putting different advertisers and 
sponsors?

2378
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:19,250
You can't.
Just different bridges.

2379
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,480
You can't.
And the issue,

2380
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:25,510
I mean in theory you will absolutely 
raise billions that I'm sure in theory,

2381
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:26,960
but you will raise billions.

2382
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,540
But the problem is you don't know which 
one goes first,

2383
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:32,810
which one is more valuable?
You don't know how long ago shades is.

2384
01:36:32,811 --> 01:36:34,220
We'll take.
You also don't know.

2385
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:37,520
Will they take the throughways also what
bridge they'll take.

2386
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:41,450
Some just may not be viable to be taken.
So I don't know each,

2387
01:36:41,451 --> 01:36:42,284
once I'm tunnels,
they may not want to take and then how 

2388
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:44,564
fast was catch on.
But the advantage is you could do this 

2389
01:36:47,361 --> 01:36:50,540
with tunnels.
You can do this with roadways.

2390
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:54,290
I mean nobody gives a shit what the 
parkways called the Verrazano Parkway.

2391
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:57,140
It's not making anybody any money by 
calling it the Verrazano Parkway.

2392
01:36:57,141 --> 01:36:58,520
Right.
Unless there's another idea.

2393
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:01,430
This is a,
there's an iad one in upstate New York,

2394
01:37:01,431 --> 01:37:04,430
which is falling apart.
So my idea for that is this thing,

2395
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:08,240
how are we going to fund this interstate
Youporn youporn highway?

2396
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:09,103
Well,
if they're willing to give you the most 

2397
01:37:09,951 --> 01:37:12,020
money,
what I'd rather do with the highway,

2398
01:37:12,510 --> 01:37:13,343
um,
but I'd rather the highway is have 

2399
01:37:16,561 --> 01:37:17,630
instead make it a google road.

2400
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:20,080
Google road.
Jesus.

2401
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:22,220
Save those fucking people.
Grip on your state.

2402
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:23,900
Oh yeah.
Well look,

2403
01:37:23,930 --> 01:37:26,810
if they want to give me a road,
here's whole road here.

2404
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:27,400
No,
here.

2405
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,660
Here is how it works.
They get their own road,

2406
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:30,523
they get their own road and they can 
make it a driverless car road whenever 

2407
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:34,123
they want.
The rent for that is maintenance of the 

2408
01:37:37,341 --> 01:37:38,540
regular road.
Okay.

2409
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:39,920
That's the rent.
That's it.

2410
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:43,640
You,
you maintained the road for free,

2411
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,980
right?
You get to keep the next to it.

2412
01:37:45,981 --> 01:37:48,740
Google road.
Now people have an option.

2413
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:50,980
You want to drive in a driverless car is
they come up with that.

2414
01:37:50,981 --> 01:37:52,820
A driverless buses or whatever they come
up with.

2415
01:37:52,821 --> 01:37:55,350
I don't care what they come up with you.
Then you take it if want to.

2416
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:58,140
If you don't drive the regular road.
If Google says,

2417
01:37:58,141 --> 01:37:59,820
I don't want to pay for anymore,
they lose the,

2418
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:00,690
someone else buys it.

2419
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:02,690
Now it becomes an Amazon road or a 
battlecat,

2420
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:04,690
whatever road becomes apple road,
whatever.

2421
01:38:04,691 --> 01:38:05,524
It was so will and it's funny.
That makes sense to me and I liked that 

2422
01:38:08,821 --> 01:38:11,190
because nobody really gives a shit what 
a road that's correct.

2423
01:38:11,191 --> 01:38:12,390
It's called,
which is why you don't,

2424
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:15,570
you don't name the road.
You give them a road next to it,

2425
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:16,710
right,
right.

2426
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:17,761
That they do.
They can,

2427
01:38:17,761 --> 01:38:18,594
but you can use that.
They can either what they want to just 

2428
01:38:20,041 --> 01:38:21,720
to transfer their goods.
For Amazon,

2429
01:38:21,721 --> 01:38:24,630
it can be an amazon hub that just moves 
Amazon products.

2430
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:25,501
Fine.
I don't care.

2431
01:38:25,501 --> 01:38:27,990
As long as you maintain the regular 
road,

2432
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:31,860
do what you want with the other road.
What other road is this again,

2433
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:33,030
it could be an Amazon road.
Where did,

2434
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:35,580
the only thing is is the hub to move 
Amazon products back and forth.

2435
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:36,810
It's fine.
Again,

2436
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,250
I don't have to know what this is.

2437
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,200
It's not required.
Okay.

2438
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:42,150
They will figure it out.
And what works for them.

2439
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:44,820
That's an innovative way to generate 
income.

2440
01:38:44,850 --> 01:38:46,620
Absolutely.
Bridges the roads.

2441
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:47,543
Not even done.
The MTN is subway ride the subway plan 

2442
01:38:49,351 --> 01:38:52,020
right now the answer is the same thing.
Just give them more money.

2443
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:54,540
No,
I'm not going to be a hostage to the MTA

2444
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:56,370
either.
The t-mobile subway.

2445
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:57,241
No,
not that.

2446
01:38:57,241 --> 01:38:58,970
No.
Instead I don't want no,

2447
01:38:59,060 --> 01:38:59,893
no.
Instead.

2448
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:00,733
Uh,
cause I think anybody would care about 

2449
01:39:01,141 --> 01:39:03,350
that anyway.
The issue is this older airlines,

2450
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:04,673
there are rail lines that the MTA 
crosses about 11 I think or maybe even 

2451
01:39:07,831 --> 01:39:09,630
12 different counter things.
11 different counties.

2452
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:10,583
So it's all over.
So and not have these lines we at night 

2453
01:39:12,661 --> 01:39:13,494
aren't used.
So why don't they freight lines that 

2454
01:39:16,831 --> 01:39:20,760
Amazon move its product from upstate New
York into Manhattan on a freight line.

2455
01:39:20,761 --> 01:39:21,594
Is that being used at night?

2456
01:39:21,810 --> 01:39:22,890
What's the,
what's the fee for that?

2457
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:25,980
Fix the lines,
fixed the lines,

2458
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,090
fixed them and maintain them.
Is that a viable alternatives?

2459
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,460
Absolutely.
Run this by people with a good sense for

2460
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:32,450
them.
People really liked the idea.

2461
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:33,450
Suppose.
Yes,

2462
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:35,550
I live in,
I live in New York City,

2463
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,010
right?
I live in Queens.

2464
01:39:38,011 --> 01:39:38,844
I work in Manhattan.
I know lots of bankers and I asked him 

2465
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:42,000
these questions and they all say,
yeah,

2466
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:42,834
nice idea.
Sometimes they say no to some stuff I 

2467
01:39:44,131 --> 01:39:44,970
say,
but these,

2468
01:39:44,971 --> 01:39:48,090
they say they actually asked how long 
the lease would be on the bridge.

2469
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:49,283
They went that far.
That's how I say like the bridge of 

2470
01:39:51,431 --> 01:39:52,710
that.
You'd like to bridge it into a obviously

2471
01:39:52,711 --> 01:39:53,580
a good idea.
It's a good idea.

2472
01:39:53,581 --> 01:39:56,400
They like it very much.
Now the answer all your idea.

2473
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:59,120
Of course she got a lock that shit down.
Why stealing?

2474
01:39:59,150 --> 01:40:02,130
Let Cynthia Nixon let let them,
Joe,

2475
01:40:02,131 --> 01:40:05,750
you just came out with the reason why 
this is so important because win,

2476
01:40:05,751 --> 01:40:09,600
lose or draw everything I'm talking 
about stays and we'll fix my state.

2477
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:10,913
People say all the time like what 
happens if everyone takes all your 

2478
01:40:12,271 --> 01:40:13,110
ideas?
Good.

2479
01:40:13,111 --> 01:40:15,390
I'll go home and go back to work.
I can stop doing this.

2480
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:16,463
So the reason why you're doing this,
it's just cause you want to affect 

2481
01:40:19,501 --> 01:40:21,840
change in New York?
I don't.

2482
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:23,550
There are three reasons why.
Number one,

2483
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:26,220
I don't want to leave New York and I'm 
noticing change.

2484
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:27,820
Do you ever go to North Carolina?
I have.

2485
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:30,190
I know.
I know that barbecue.

2486
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:32,940
I get it and I don't and I don't want to
go.

2487
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:34,830
So yes,
stop teasing me.

2488
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,630
So yes,
I don't want to go.

2489
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:39,150
That's the number one reason is I want 
to stay in New York.

2490
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:40,020
Okay.
Number one.

2491
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:43,530
But also I want to change the state for 
better,

2492
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:46,710
but even more,
I can change the nation for better.

2493
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:50,070
When New York can be the place where we 
will look and go,

2494
01:40:50,071 --> 01:40:51,360
wow,
you know what?

2495
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,100
We can start doing these things.
I'm not even done.

2496
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,110
Okay.
Talking about a small business,

2497
01:40:56,111 --> 01:40:59,350
right?
Wyoming has a law right now that says,

2498
01:40:59,351 --> 01:41:02,590
if you're a small farmer and you agree 
to not sell outside of Wyoming,

2499
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:03,663
that you're immune from federal 
regulatory bodies helps the small 

2500
01:41:06,641 --> 01:41:07,780
farmers,
they get a leg up.

2501
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:09,173
There's something in New York,
but why can't they just for every 

2502
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:11,800
business,
every small business,

2503
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:12,843
if you agree you will only sell locally.
Why are you being bothered by the 

2504
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:16,363
program and how does uh,
the commerce clause come into effect 

2505
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:18,753
here?
It doesn't.

2506
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:21,640
So how about we make that happen?
So that applies to all restaurants.

2507
01:41:21,641 --> 01:41:22,270
Of course.

2508
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:23,103
Absolutely.
But unless some border restaurants 

2509
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:26,890
actually deliver across the border.
Okay.

2510
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:28,870
So you live across the border now that 
won't work.

2511
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:29,980
And what will get delivered?
That's great.

2512
01:41:29,981 --> 01:41:31,270
If you deliver across the board doesn't 
work.

2513
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:33,280
If you don't deliver or don't cross the 
border,

2514
01:41:33,281 --> 01:41:34,114
you're fine.
What about if you used one of those 

2515
01:41:34,721 --> 01:41:37,450
third party delivery services,
you know where they are using an app and

2516
01:41:37,451 --> 01:41:38,284
they order something and the APP would 
be the people who are actually doing 

2517
01:41:40,361 --> 01:41:42,100
delivery would be responsible.
You would not.

2518
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,420
Okay.
As long as that.

2519
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:44,950
As long as that company's based in New 
York state.

2520
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:47,320
So this keeps all the money in New York 
state?

2521
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:48,303
No,
it does give all the money in your 

2522
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:49,590
state.
Good amount of it.

2523
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:54,600
It gives the small business owner a shot
at competing as large businesses,

2524
01:41:54,851 --> 01:41:57,180
which almost always cross borders.
Right.

2525
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:59,170
Gives farmers a much greater incentive.

2526
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:02,470
Yes.
And to be more farm to table less stuff.

2527
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:03,613
Now I've gotta help my farmers out.
My New York state farmers are hurting 

2528
01:42:05,111 --> 01:42:06,490
badly.
That's one idea.

2529
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:07,473
But a second thing is you want to treat 
farmers like small businesses and 

2530
01:42:09,941 --> 01:42:10,774
they're not,
which means they don't get the SBA 

2531
01:42:12,101 --> 01:42:13,570
loans,
they don't get help.

2532
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,433
They'll get treated that way.
It does not work when you treat them 

2533
01:42:15,611 --> 01:42:19,750
like small businesses.
But next I want to completely legalize a

2534
01:42:19,751 --> 01:42:22,480
hemp and cannabis.
And then whenever you're talking,

2535
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,300
and I want to regulate them like onions,
onions,

2536
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:27,310
like onions and my joking,
like onions,

2537
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:29,630
onions.
He's the reason why a lot of onions come

2538
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:30,880
out of New York.
That's right.

2539
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:33,640
Yes.
So as my onions and no one cares.

2540
01:42:33,650 --> 01:42:35,020
Bingo.
Exactly correct.

2541
01:42:35,021 --> 01:42:35,854
And here's the issue.
There are three reasons why I want to 

2542
01:42:36,561 --> 01:42:39,430
leave lives.
Hemp and cannabis and most of the things

2543
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:40,240
you want to get high.

2544
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,073
No,
the only drug I use is cannabis because 

2545
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:44,080
cannabis is a caffeine.
Oh,

2546
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:45,220
buff cell.
This is the only drug.

2547
01:42:45,221 --> 01:42:46,054
Freud.
Yeah,

2548
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:47,410
I like that.
And that's about cannabis.

2549
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,180
I know.
But if I use cannabis,

2550
01:42:49,210 --> 01:42:51,640
I would happily tell you so I don't have
him to hide.

2551
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:52,783
Why not happily tell you don't use it.
That my thing [inaudible] paranoid and 

2552
01:42:55,871 --> 01:42:57,190
worried about the school system.
When you get hired.

2553
01:42:57,191 --> 01:43:00,550
I think I talk even more.
I don't want to talk even more,

2554
01:43:00,551 --> 01:43:01,170
do I?
Nobody.

2555
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:04,420
I would have my grampy introspective.
You might sit back and go,

2556
01:43:04,421 --> 01:43:05,470
God,
I talk too much.

2557
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:07,290
Yeah,
maybe then I could mushrooms.

2558
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:09,280
Then I could do this.
I've never done mushrooms.

2559
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:11,680
I never want to do mushrooms.
I feel like I talked too much,

2560
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:13,370
so maybe,
maybe I should try them one day.

2561
01:43:13,371 --> 01:43:15,880
I've never done mushrooms and mushroom.
That makes me uncomfortable.

2562
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:16,391
Yes.
Yeah.

2563
01:43:16,391 --> 01:43:16,731
I'm,
I'm,

2564
01:43:16,731 --> 01:43:17,564
I'm,
I'm,

2565
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:21,040
I'm 50.
I'm 51 there we go.

2566
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:22,360
You've never done mushrooms?
Never.

2567
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:23,620
So somebody came up to you go,
Larry,

2568
01:43:23,621 --> 01:43:24,760
you want to do some mushrooms?
And you're like,

2569
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:26,320
no man,
one day I want to be governor.

2570
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:28,750
That's what I was thinking.
I was seven and I thought,

2571
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:29,943
can I be governor went this says who's 
bringing questions to a fucking seven 

2572
01:43:32,051 --> 01:43:32,620
year old?
Oh,

2573
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:34,430
that's what I'm was psycho.
Are you hanging around with it?

2574
01:43:34,570 --> 01:43:35,540
You got it.
You don't understand why?

2575
01:43:35,570 --> 01:43:36,910
Where I grew up,
when I grew up,

2576
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:39,220
where I grew up now I grew up in south 
bronx.

2577
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:40,720
Oh,
even more crazy.

2578
01:43:40,721 --> 01:43:42,820
It was crazy.
And then Tim dog,

2579
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:44,500
I didn't know who tim dog is.
Sorry,

2580
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:47,230
I haven't been in the Bronx.
South Bronx.

2581
01:43:47,231 --> 01:43:48,064
Sorry.
I haven't been in the bronx in many 

2582
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:49,893
years.
I'll dress.

2583
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,560
But anyway,
it wasn't obscure.

2584
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,740
Reference Mushrooms and marijuana.
Yes.

2585
01:43:54,741 --> 01:43:55,574
Thank you.
All right.

2586
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:57,950
You've never smoked pot?
I have not.

2587
01:43:58,370 --> 01:43:59,150
Nope.
Never.

2588
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:02,090
Never have what I can't ever have behind
you,

2589
01:44:02,091 --> 01:44:02,924
bro.
Sorry.

2590
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:04,610
Never had.
What kind of square are you?

2591
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:06,460
Damn snow.
No Pie.

2592
01:44:06,461 --> 01:44:08,510
L Mushrooms.
Acid?

2593
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:09,620
Nope.
Do you want to try it?

2594
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:11,600
Maybe one day.
Live on right now.

2595
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:12,620
No,
not now.

2596
01:44:12,670 --> 01:44:13,170
No,
no,

2597
01:44:13,170 --> 01:44:13,491
no,
no.

2598
01:44:13,491 --> 01:44:14,630
I'm running.
Can't pay my friend.

2599
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:17,260
Oh,
maybe we'll help you then.

2600
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:20,330
Odds are now talking to them as seventh.
Okay.

2601
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:23,000
Did I'm a seventh to be forward.
I'm not against any of these things.

2602
01:44:23,001 --> 01:44:23,781
Right?
It's your body.

2603
01:44:23,781 --> 01:44:24,770
You owned your body.
Okay,

2604
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:25,633
so if I,
if I tried cannabis now I don't drink 

2605
01:44:27,231 --> 01:44:28,550
either.
You don't have her drink.

2606
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:32,630
Not even a glass of wine with dinner.
If people are around drinking,

2607
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:34,220
I'll drink,
but I don't,

2608
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:35,600
I don't have any alcohol in my house.

2609
01:44:36,110 --> 01:44:37,790
I don't drink unless all those were 
drinking.

2610
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:38,773
Okay.
Um,

2611
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:39,790
I'll socially drank again.
I'm,

2612
01:44:39,791 --> 01:44:42,220
I'm getting out of bed.
Theresa will drink.

2613
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:44,480
You are focused for most of your life 
has been what?

2614
01:44:44,481 --> 01:44:46,080
Business?
Uh,

2615
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:48,950
first it was military.
I was a marine for seven years and then,

2616
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:51,230
and then it was business.
Yes.

2617
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:52,370
So you're just,
uh,

2618
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:54,500
keep your nose to the grindstone kind of
guy.

2619
01:44:54,910 --> 01:44:56,600
Get this done.
How else could I do this?

2620
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:57,493
Have you seen my campaign?
This is the last three gubernatorial 

2621
01:45:01,701 --> 01:45:06,701
campaigns in New York state combined 
didn't raise $10,000 combined.

2622
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:08,023
I raised over a quarter million already.
The last three gubernatorial candidates 

2623
01:45:10,821 --> 01:45:11,654
combined didn't do anywhere near the 
amount of stops I've made and I slept 

2624
01:45:14,001 --> 01:45:15,410
too much.
Like how much is Cynthia Nixon?

2625
01:45:15,411 --> 01:45:17,630
Raise a 1.7,
I think.

2626
01:45:17,631 --> 01:45:18,020
Male,
you know,

2627
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:19,280
ain't,
that is crazy.

2628
01:45:19,281 --> 01:45:22,070
I think people are getting behind sex in
the city a lot.

2629
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:23,750
There's a lot of that menopause money 
out there,

2630
01:45:23,751 --> 01:45:25,100
bro.
I need some of that,

2631
01:45:25,101 --> 01:45:26,060
I guess.
I Dunno.

2632
01:45:26,090 --> 01:45:29,150
It's flickering around my point being 
yes,

2633
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:31,250
nose to the grindstone.
I'm doing this.

2634
01:45:31,251 --> 01:45:32,380
Of course.
I believe it.

2635
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:34,550
Literally no mushrooms,
no mushrooms,

2636
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:35,780
no.
Maybe later,

2637
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:39,080
no.
Wait till November 7th and then once you

2638
01:45:39,081 --> 01:45:41,720
hit then maybe we'll see maybe your 
party with me.

2639
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,690
Maybe if I win,
I can't do it while while I'm governor.

2640
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:45,920
That would be,
that would be,

2641
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:48,500
that would be not cool,
but marijuana,

2642
01:45:48,650 --> 01:45:50,120
isn't it legal in New York state?
No,

2643
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:52,340
still not.
You have to have serious diseases,

2644
01:45:52,341 --> 01:45:53,174
right?
That's correct.

2645
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:56,540
Medical and you fix that of course.
Why the point?

2646
01:45:56,570 --> 01:45:57,403
Yeah,
that seems really proposed to my whole 

2647
01:45:58,581 --> 01:46:01,820
point on cannabis and hemp is heavily 
because of farmers also,

2648
01:46:01,821 --> 01:46:02,654
right?
Right.

2649
01:46:02,710 --> 01:46:04,910
Small farmers right now,
yes.

2650
01:46:04,911 --> 01:46:05,601
Particularly has,
yes.

2651
01:46:05,601 --> 01:46:06,434
Hoadley,
uncontroversial and it's a fantastic 

2652
01:46:08,060 --> 01:46:08,630
commodity.

2653
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:10,550
It's good,
it's good for the soil,

2654
01:46:10,551 --> 01:46:14,510
it's good for the environment and the 
best thing is if you treat small farmers

2655
01:46:14,511 --> 01:46:16,820
like small businesses,
they can now specialize,

2656
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:20,750
meaning they can specialize in hip and 
then also create products in their farm.

2657
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:21,943
Then with specialized hemp products,
they can do that and create niche 

2658
01:46:24,771 --> 01:46:25,870
industries.
Right,

2659
01:46:25,890 --> 01:46:26,723
right.
And we see that in New York state with 

2660
01:46:27,051 --> 01:46:29,420
both coffee and um,
and breweries,

2661
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:30,710
we said already happening in New York 
state.

2662
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:35,360
And you would have the same sort of 
incentives for them to sell in New York.

2663
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:36,590
Absolutely.
Yes.

2664
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:37,453
So particularly hemp,
which would be incredibly beneficial 

2665
01:46:39,141 --> 01:46:40,760
with zero controversy.
That's correct.

2666
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,790
In terms of like psychoactive effects,
it doesn't have people,

2667
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,440
people would be very happy to do that.
Right.

2668
01:46:45,710 --> 01:46:46,543
But cannabis too,
because I want you to be able to create 

2669
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:50,250
cannabis products,
but there's something else

2670
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:51,113
and that is,
there are a lot of people in this 

2671
01:46:51,661 --> 01:46:52,494
country,
but I'll tell about New York state 

2672
01:46:53,171 --> 01:46:56,550
civically who have chronic pain.
And right now they have three choices,

2673
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:59,670
one opioid and maybe get addicted to 
suffer,

2674
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:02,310
which I don't accept all three.
What people tell me,

2675
01:47:02,311 --> 01:47:03,270
and for some reason,
again,

2676
01:47:03,271 --> 01:47:04,440
it's only been women who have told me 
this,

2677
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:06,120
they walk up to me and say,
you know,

2678
01:47:06,121 --> 01:47:08,250
Laurie,
I hope we can legalize marijuana because

2679
01:47:08,251 --> 01:47:10,110
I smoke a little at night so I can go to
sleep.

2680
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:12,840
What about cbd?
CBD is legal in your state?

2681
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:14,100
I don't think so.
It's not,

2682
01:47:14,101 --> 01:47:16,110
I don't think it is fucking,
I don't,

2683
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:17,041
you know,
that's a good question.

2684
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:18,520
I don't think it is.
That's crazy.

2685
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:19,340
My medicinal,
no,

2686
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:21,510
I'm sorry.
It's probably medicinal cbd.

2687
01:47:21,550 --> 01:47:23,100
Probably minute.
That'd be my assumption.

2688
01:47:23,430 --> 01:47:27,240
But CBD has no psychoactive effect,
but it comes out of it.

2689
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,380
It comes from cannabis,
right?

2690
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:30,900
So I,
I think it is,

2691
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:32,430
look it up real quick.
I think it's just,

2692
01:47:32,431 --> 01:47:36,270
I think it's medical in New York state 
did some sort of a doctor's prescription

2693
01:47:36,271 --> 01:47:38,410
to get cbd.
So my point is if it's onion,

2694
01:47:38,411 --> 01:47:39,630
you can grow in your backyard,
right?

2695
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:40,503
Great medicine.
Your backyard,

2696
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:42,300
right?
If we heavily,

2697
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,433
yes.
If we heavily regulate cannabis and or 

2698
01:47:45,781 --> 01:47:47,610
hemp,
big business wins,

2699
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:51,570
small business loses guaranteed,
it'll become big business cronyism.

2700
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:54,300
The small farmers collapse.
It's the wrong answer.

2701
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:55,920
Right?
So we need to make that happen.

2702
01:47:55,921 --> 01:47:58,830
And people already smoking it and maybe 
you don't want to smoke it.

2703
01:47:58,831 --> 01:48:00,810
Why don't you have an edible?
Why don't Ya,

2704
01:48:00,811 --> 01:48:01,644
I have liquid.
Why don't you have whatever is your 

2705
01:48:02,821 --> 01:48:04,110
thing.
You don't have to smell it.

2706
01:48:04,111 --> 01:48:05,190
If you want to smoke it,
please smoke it.

2707
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,590
But there's many ways of,
of taking advantage of,

2708
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:11,220
of both thc and cbd,
which you prefer.

2709
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:13,050
And look at your body,
not mine.

2710
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,273
And why in the world what I want you to 
have to live with chronic pain if you 

2711
01:48:16,921 --> 01:48:19,560
don't have to write.
Why do you see,

2712
01:48:19,561 --> 01:48:22,340
because cbd again is not psychoactive 
isn't legal.

2713
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:23,581
Yeah.
Okay.

2714
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:24,720
It is legal in New York.
There we go.

2715
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,240
It's,
it's pretty legal everywhere.

2716
01:48:27,241 --> 01:48:28,074
CBD because of the fact that it doesn't 
have any psychoactive effects and it's 

2717
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:35,250
fantastic for people with arthritis.
And so we got older folks are,

2718
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:36,480
I mean,
shit,

2719
01:48:36,481 --> 01:48:38,670
I got Ted nugent taken it.
How about like that?

2720
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:43,770
He's never even touched anything tech 
related does he likes my facebook stuff?

2721
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:45,900
Well,
one of the things can be Ted likes.

2722
01:48:45,901 --> 01:48:48,970
Is that your second amendment proponent?
I am.

2723
01:48:48,971 --> 01:48:49,804
You know,
very true.

2724
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:51,410
Uh,
you know,

2725
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:52,253
there's an issue that I have with people
demonizing the National Rifle 

2726
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:56,303
Association.
And one big issue is they always point 

2727
01:48:57,421 --> 01:48:59,250
to these school shootings and I'm like,
God damn it,

2728
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:02,160
not a single NRA member has ever 
committed.

2729
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,890
One of these mass shootings.
This is not NRA members.

2730
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:09,180
So you guys are going after people that 
are fighting for the right for people to

2731
01:49:09,181 --> 01:49:13,950
have arms when there's people that are 
taking these arms and they're using them

2732
01:49:13,951 --> 01:49:15,470
completely illegally.
Yeah.

2733
01:49:15,490 --> 01:49:17,940
None of them are in the NRA.
It doesn't make any sense.

2734
01:49:18,090 --> 01:49:19,560
Yup.
We find a boogie man.

2735
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:21,083
Right.
But that boogeyman is culturally 

2736
01:49:21,901 --> 01:49:22,750
accepted.
Yes.

2737
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:23,663
And it's really confusing.
And then it's not helped by the fact 

2738
01:49:26,821 --> 01:49:28,950
that a lot of people that are nra 
proponents get,

2739
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:30,133
you know,
they dig their heels in the sand and 

2740
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:32,753
they fight hard and very much 
emotionally so against people who are 

2741
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:41,400
against the NRA.
And then it becomes this tribal thing.

2742
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:42,770
It does.
And the tribal issues,

2743
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:44,130
the biggest issue.
I totally agree.

2744
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:46,950
It's a point where you're not even 
listening to each other.

2745
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,130
Yeah.
And this is why

2746
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:51,160
I say the third party is the way,
look,

2747
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:53,620
people ask Larry,
can you win this thing here?

2748
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:54,850
And I hear it all the time.
And the biggest,

2749
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:58,870
the biggest critique I get is you can't 
win,

2750
01:49:58,871 --> 01:49:59,704
man.
What do you do when you can't play in 

2751
01:50:00,531 --> 01:50:01,780
that too?
Particularly right now,

2752
01:50:01,781 --> 01:50:03,230
Republicans,
but some Democrats to,

2753
01:50:03,490 --> 01:50:04,930
they're heavily said you can't win.
You can't win.

2754
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:06,460
You can't win.
But to answer,

2755
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:08,390
there are some aren't win.
Yeah.

2756
01:50:08,450 --> 01:50:09,281
A lot of them are.
Some are,

2757
01:50:09,281 --> 01:50:10,420
some aren't.
But the two things,

2758
01:50:10,421 --> 01:50:13,690
remember that the first thing is I can 
win.

2759
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:14,733
And here's the reason why the Republican
cannot win because there's only about 

2760
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:18,694
two and a half million Republicans in 
New York state and about 600 million 

2761
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:22,800
Democrats in New York state give or take
the,

2762
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:25,660
the tribalism we have now,
if you're a Democrat,

2763
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,430
you're not going to vote for Republican.
If you're a Republican,

2764
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:31,520
you're not going to vote Democrat,
but you might vote for the material.

2765
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:34,270
You might have up with somebody who is 
not the other evil guy.

2766
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:37,240
So I have the option of getting the 
other things.

2767
01:50:37,241 --> 01:50:38,074
I can get the other guys and I can get 
the setting percent of New Yorkers who 

2768
01:50:41,171 --> 01:50:42,700
don't vote.
I can get those.

2769
01:50:42,701 --> 01:50:45,040
So there's a chance to win.
Add on top of that.

2770
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:47,860
A five way race,
only getting 30% to win.

2771
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:50,140
This is a winnable,
racist can be done.

2772
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:53,260
But let's say I'm wrong.
I've been wrong.

2773
01:50:53,290 --> 01:50:54,123
Maybe all my ideas are wrong.
Maybe every hole you found is a is a 

2774
01:50:57,221 --> 01:50:58,054
real hole and it can't be done.
And maybe they all destroy me and they 

2775
01:51:01,181 --> 01:51:04,300
beat me up and I can't win.
Get rid of those poles and you win bro.

2776
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:08,380
Get those fucking balls out.
Get those tolls.

2777
01:51:08,410 --> 01:51:10,310
Not polls rather tolls.
You mean you told us,

2778
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:12,310
yes,
you can win the whole thing,

2779
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:13,630
but say I'm wrong and I can't win.

2780
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:15,940
Great.
If I just come in second,

2781
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,670
I beat the Republican.
Only imagine what it does for the state.

2782
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:19,953
The first thing it does is it shows them
that a third party can actually have 

2783
01:51:22,241 --> 01:51:23,074
impact in New York state,
which changed the entire nation off the 

2784
01:51:25,301 --> 01:51:26,090
bat.
People,

2785
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:27,370
third parties without thinking,
wait a minute,

2786
01:51:27,371 --> 01:51:29,620
we can do something in a big state.
Yes.

2787
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:31,960
And something else.
It'll make better republicans and better

2788
01:51:31,961 --> 01:51:33,610
Democrats.
Cause right now,

2789
01:51:33,611 --> 01:51:35,590
neither of them does anything for 
anybody.

2790
01:51:35,591 --> 01:51:38,170
They don't care if nothing gets done.
But when there's a third party,

2791
01:51:38,171 --> 01:51:40,480
I become the referee.
I'm the one who says,

2792
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:41,493
Democrats,
you're supposed to be about civil 

2793
01:51:42,191 --> 01:51:43,810
liberties.
You're not what's wrong?

2794
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:44,943
Republican's,
you're supposed to be about less 

2795
01:51:45,461 --> 01:51:47,650
government and second amendment and 
small business.

2796
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:49,570
You're not what's wrong?
And now the media,

2797
01:51:49,571 --> 01:51:50,404
here's me now people hear me.
They have to become better because if 

2798
01:51:53,591 --> 01:51:54,424
they're not,
they'll come to me instead and they'll 

2799
01:51:55,391 --> 01:51:57,790
see it and had a fear.
They'll begin to change.

2800
01:51:57,950 --> 01:52:01,400
Now what do you think about this move 
toward Democratic Socialism?

2801
01:52:01,401 --> 01:52:04,550
And you're seeing this a lot in young 
kids in particular.

2802
01:52:04,551 --> 01:52:09,290
They seem to be abandoning this old 
system and trying to adopt a,

2803
01:52:09,430 --> 01:52:12,520
a much more radical left wing system.
Yes.

2804
01:52:12,830 --> 01:52:15,110
And uh,
apparently there's some real problems.

2805
01:52:15,111 --> 01:52:16,210
That lady who won,

2806
01:52:17,050 --> 01:52:18,840
she's literally my congresswoman.
She wouldn't,

2807
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:19,541
my counseling.
Yes.

2808
01:52:19,541 --> 01:52:20,374
Yeah.
AOC.

2809
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:23,630
Yeah.
Alexandria ocasio Alexandria.

2810
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,000
Um,
Bushy Cortez.

2811
01:52:25,001 --> 01:52:25,260
Was

2812
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:25,510
it,
it,

2813
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:26,343
was that true or they smear on her?
Or is it true that she used to be a 

2814
01:52:29,441 --> 01:52:32,080
Republican?
Antiabortion uh,

2815
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:33,580
I have no idea.
Person.

2816
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,220
I don't know.
And that she's really from Florida.

2817
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:37,880
I don't know.
I don't know.

2818
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:41,920
There's a lot of people are so terrified
of her and yet you know,

2819
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:44,830
and attacking her and she's made some 
missteps too.

2820
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,040
You know,
on her

2821
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:49,310
own.
We have to realize is socialism for most

2822
01:52:49,311 --> 01:52:50,144
Americans today till the young young 
ones is just the newest ideology of 

2823
01:52:53,781 --> 01:52:54,790
rebellion.
Bright.

2824
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:56,570
It's all it is.
Most of them don't know.

2825
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,090
Most of the people,
the youngsters particularly who actually

2826
01:52:59,091 --> 01:53:01,880
supported Bernie couldn't tell you any 
of his policies.

2827
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:03,073
Right.
They just knew he wasn't the 

2828
01:53:04,041 --> 01:53:05,750
establishment.
Disabled trump though.

2829
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:07,000
There are a lot of people swear trump 
who would,

2830
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:09,740
couldn't tell you one policy,
but there's things he was in rebellion.

2831
01:53:09,770 --> 01:53:12,560
The Bernie says that that resonate with 
people.

2832
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:13,543
Yes.
One of them is that there's income 

2833
01:53:15,591 --> 01:53:17,450
inequality in this country.
Very true.

2834
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:19,580
That's a big one.
And so people say,

2835
01:53:19,581 --> 01:53:20,414
Oh,
well the game is rigged and Bernie is 

2836
01:53:21,211 --> 01:53:22,400
going to fix it.
Yes.

2837
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:23,391
Well,
the game is rigged.

2838
01:53:23,391 --> 01:53:25,250
That's true.
And it didn't quality.

2839
01:53:25,251 --> 01:53:26,090
It's having,
that's true,

2840
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:27,770
but it's rick,
because of corruption,

2841
01:53:27,771 --> 01:53:28,940
because of the two party system.

2842
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:31,960
It's rigged because of crony capitalism.
Right.

2843
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:33,470
That's why it's rigged,
but it is rigged.

2844
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:38,300
The problem is you have a system where 
people keep saying it's the free market,

2845
01:53:38,570 --> 01:53:40,070
right?
This happened with Obamacare,

2846
01:53:40,071 --> 01:53:41,210
by the way,
with obamacare.

2847
01:53:41,211 --> 01:53:41,631
They said,
well,

2848
01:53:41,631 --> 01:53:42,890
we have,
we have markets,

2849
01:53:42,891 --> 01:53:43,724
right?
We have the market place where you can 

2850
01:53:44,541 --> 01:53:47,450
go buy insurance.
And what people that heard was,

2851
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:48,710
oh,
it's a free market.

2852
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:50,630
It's not a free market.
But that's what they heard.

2853
01:53:50,631 --> 01:53:51,464
It was a free market.
So then when obamacare fails in certain 

2854
01:53:53,901 --> 01:53:54,800
states,
what do they say?

2855
01:53:55,130 --> 01:53:56,360
The market didn't work.
See,

2856
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:58,820
we need single payer.
The market didn't work.

2857
01:53:58,821 --> 01:54:01,250
We need single payer.
That's how it's spun.

2858
01:54:01,550 --> 01:54:02,660
And single payer is,
oh,

2859
01:54:02,661 --> 01:54:03,710
single payer.
What's the right answer?

2860
01:54:03,890 --> 01:54:05,930
It's Medicare for all.
Well,

2861
01:54:05,931 --> 01:54:06,764
that sounds amazing,
but it won't be what it will be as va 

2862
01:54:09,771 --> 01:54:12,290
for all and the va to disaster.

2863
01:54:13,070 --> 01:54:15,410
It'd be a two tiered system.
And I said disaster.

2864
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:16,453
And what most we don't realize is 
socialism actually equals a two tiered 

2865
01:54:18,501 --> 01:54:19,334
system.
The reason why so many people who are 

2866
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:23,930
wealthy will will be fine with obamacare
or socialism.

2867
01:54:23,931 --> 01:54:26,840
Is it because they're not gonna use it?
They're not using it.

2868
01:54:27,050 --> 01:54:28,130
I see him Manhattan,
right?

2869
01:54:28,131 --> 01:54:29,330
Where we're,
I'm in Manhattan,

2870
01:54:29,331 --> 01:54:30,164
it's already happening because of how 
New York state works and how bad the 

2871
01:54:32,451 --> 01:54:33,284
system is.
You have less and less options for 

2872
01:54:34,851 --> 01:54:35,684
insurance.
And only like one or two insurers and I 

2873
01:54:36,471 --> 01:54:38,020
left the New York state,
they leave and they're walking away with

2874
01:54:38,030 --> 01:54:38,870
them.
It can't make any money.

2875
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:42,620
So what's happening now is all the best 
doctors shouldn't say all,

2876
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:44,960
most of the best doctors don't take 
insurance anymore.

2877
01:54:45,650 --> 01:54:46,340
Really?
Don't.

2878
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:48,200
They just don't think it.
Really.

2879
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:49,850
Yes.
So what you have to do,

2880
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:53,060
just doctors have enough patients that 
are wealthy,

2881
01:54:53,061 --> 01:54:55,010
that want the best medical care there 
can go,

2882
01:54:55,011 --> 01:54:56,300
look,
you're going to have to pay me.

2883
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:57,090
Yes.
And,

2884
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:58,430
and it's actually a better,
I know,

2885
01:54:58,431 --> 01:54:59,450
cause in my own family.
Right?

2886
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:01,520
That's crazy.
I'm a business owner,

2887
01:55:01,521 --> 01:55:03,410
so I have to pay for my own obamacare.
Right.

2888
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:04,273
But my wife phone going obamacare.
So my wife takes private doctors and I 

2889
01:55:08,541 --> 01:55:11,390
take obamacare doctors.
That's how I spoke to my actual family.

2890
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:15,110
So when we go to a doctor's office and 
you can see a difference,

2891
01:55:15,111 --> 01:55:15,944
right?
If it's,

2892
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:20,750
if a doctor takes insurance,
two doctorates in a doctor's office,

2893
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:21,913
five people who are administrators and 
they care more about photocopying your 

2894
01:55:27,891 --> 01:55:29,210
documents,
then you,

2895
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:31,430
you're in the way that the,
the,

2896
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,080
the rooms bad.
No one cares.

2897
01:55:33,081 --> 01:55:34,610
Whatever your appointment's at two 
o'clock,

2898
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:38,300
you can see that three 45 now change it.
Now it's a doctor who does,

2899
01:55:38,330 --> 01:55:39,163
who does not take insurance when I was 
five doctors and that office two 

2900
01:55:41,181 --> 01:55:42,830
administrators,
you show up to that,

2901
01:55:42,831 --> 01:55:43,470
hey,
how are you?

2902
01:55:43,470 --> 01:55:45,000
What's going on?
Please have a seat.

2903
01:55:45,001 --> 01:55:45,834
Whatever.
They take your credit card or your 

2904
01:55:46,831 --> 01:55:47,551
check,
whatever,

2905
01:55:47,551 --> 01:55:48,540
boom,
you're good to go.

2906
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:50,490
You want me to two o'clock.
He sent two oh five.

2907
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:54,060
While the comparison of valid comparison
is the Canada's healthcare system versus

2908
01:55:54,061 --> 01:55:54,894
Americans.
I have friends from Canada to come to 

2909
01:55:56,611 --> 01:56:00,840
America to get healthcare because the 
healthcare system over there,

2910
01:56:00,841 --> 01:56:02,640
although it's free,
it's not as good.

2911
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:03,503
That's correct.
Many aspects and the waiting lists are 

2912
01:56:04,711 --> 01:56:06,780
massive.
And the wealthy come someplace else.

2913
01:56:06,781 --> 01:56:07,680
A two tiered system.
Exactly.

2914
01:56:07,681 --> 01:56:08,300
Correct.
Right,

2915
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:09,133
right.
They live out of a thing now where you 

2916
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:12,480
go go on vacation and get your uh,
your,

2917
01:56:12,481 --> 01:56:13,770
your,
your stuff done right.

2918
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:15,320
I'll get my case.
I mean,

2919
01:56:15,321 --> 01:56:16,081
it's,
it's horrible,

2920
01:56:16,081 --> 01:56:18,690
right?
But let me finish the last piece in the,

2921
01:56:18,770 --> 01:56:20,040
if you have a,
uh,

2922
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,080
an insurance,
the author takes insurance,

2923
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:24,210
he'll talk to you for maybe five,
10,

2924
01:56:24,211 --> 01:56:25,044
15 minutes at most,
and it will always end with one or two 

2925
01:56:26,881 --> 01:56:29,170
things,
a prescription or procedure.

2926
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:31,710
It's how they get paid.
The bill Medicare,

2927
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:33,180
right?
They build Medicaid,

2928
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:36,060
they bill your insurance company,
prescription or procedure.

2929
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:38,970
They always doing this.
I didn't make money private.

2930
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:40,950
The person talks for 20 minutes,
30 minutes.

2931
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:42,870
Ask you things that matter.
Like how are you eating?

2932
01:56:42,871 --> 01:56:44,850
How are you sleeping?
What's your stress level?

2933
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:47,880
Things actually matter when it comes to 
your health.

2934
01:56:47,881 --> 01:56:50,070
They asked those questions,
what's going on?

2935
01:56:50,090 --> 01:56:52,320
One of those things,
they begin to ask these questions to see

2936
01:56:52,321 --> 01:56:54,270
if it works.
Then it doesn't always end with that.

2937
01:56:54,271 --> 01:56:55,104
It ends with whatever's appropriate 
because you're writing them a check 

2938
01:56:56,671 --> 01:56:57,480
anyway,
right?

2939
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,070
They're getting a 300 bucks for one 
visit,

2940
01:56:59,100 --> 01:56:59,933
no matter what.
You write him a check where you swipe 

2941
01:57:00,541 --> 01:57:01,374
your credit card and there's an 
incentive for you to talk about what a 

2942
01:57:03,661 --> 01:57:05,070
good doctor they are.
So correct.

2943
01:57:05,150 --> 01:57:07,200
More business that pays them the same 
way you're paying.

2944
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,033
That is exactly correct.
And they don't have to go through 

2945
01:57:09,570 --> 01:57:11,040
paperwork.
You are the customer,

2946
01:57:11,090 --> 01:57:12,090
right?
Right.

2947
01:57:12,091 --> 01:57:14,520
When it comes to anyone takes insurance,
the insurance companies,

2948
01:57:14,521 --> 01:57:15,354
the customer,
no people that are listening to this 

2949
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:19,710
that don't have enough money to pay for 
that are saying,

2950
01:57:19,711 --> 01:57:24,090
well I want that kind of care and I I 
wanted to be federally funded.

2951
01:57:24,150 --> 01:57:25,440
Yup.
Is that possible?

2952
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:28,160
The combination?
No.

2953
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:29,910
No.
Can you get good care?

2954
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:30,960
Yes.
And how do I know this?

2955
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:31,943
Again,
anything I'm saying is based on 

2956
01:57:33,181 --> 01:57:33,960
something,
right?

2957
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:34,793
Right.
And the best example I can give you is 

2958
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:40,820
non nonemergency or non critical care 
things like Lasik,

2959
01:57:40,821 --> 01:57:43,920
eye surgery,
things like cosmetic dentistry,

2960
01:57:44,130 --> 01:57:45,300
all types of things.
Right.

2961
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:47,370
Um,
getting breast enhancements,

2962
01:57:47,371 --> 01:57:48,840
things of that sort.
Any type of enhancement.

2963
01:57:48,841 --> 01:57:49,621
Yes.
Any of those things.

2964
01:57:49,621 --> 01:57:51,300
Right?
If you remember years ago,

2965
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:52,110
you're as old as I am.

2966
01:57:52,110 --> 01:57:54,420
So you know when,
when Lasik first came out,

2967
01:57:54,690 --> 01:57:57,270
they should charge you per eye cause 
it's so expensive.

2968
01:57:57,750 --> 01:57:58,583
It was so expensive as per eye.
Now you get both done for less than a 

2969
01:58:01,710 --> 01:58:02,620
thousand bucks.
Right.

2970
01:58:02,650 --> 01:58:04,140
And I was a couple hundred bucks 
depending on where you go.

2971
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:07,890
So what's happened in every instance,
service level's going up,

2972
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,233
price has gone down,
technology has gone up in every case 

2973
01:58:13,170 --> 01:58:14,003
that's happened.
So why don't we follow the same model 

2974
01:58:15,691 --> 01:58:18,000
and in this and can it work sort of 
happening.

2975
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:20,430
The Oklahoma Surgery Center right now,
right?

2976
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:22,110
It's doing it right now.
Leading Lady,

2977
01:58:22,230 --> 01:58:24,450
they list other pricing,
right?

2978
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:25,810
So you can,
you can actually like,

2979
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:26,581
oh okay,
I can get this.

2980
01:58:26,581 --> 01:58:27,710
I know what the cost is cheaper than 
anything.

2981
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:29,370
House outside of insurance.
Correct?

2982
01:58:29,371 --> 01:58:30,270
No assurance.
Yes.

2983
01:58:30,450 --> 01:58:32,160
There's a motto popping up in certain 
areas.

2984
01:58:32,161 --> 01:58:35,130
Now doctors that are coming out of is an
Oklahoma only that I know of.

2985
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:37,380
There may be others,
but then that one I know of interests,

2986
01:58:37,381 --> 01:58:38,570
right?
So I think it's,

2987
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:41,740
I think it's actually called the 
Oklahoma Center for surgery or something

2988
01:58:41,741 --> 01:58:42,910
like surgery center or something like 
that.

2989
01:58:43,090 --> 01:58:43,923
And so the ideal situation would be that
would be available for people that can 

2990
01:58:48,851 --> 01:58:51,520
afford it.
And for people that can't afford it,

2991
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:53,340
there's always going to be catastrophic 
healthcare.

2992
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:55,240
You break your leg,
you're going to be taken care of.

2993
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:57,370
Well here's the hit the flu,
you're going to be taken care of.

2994
01:58:57,371 --> 01:58:58,204
There's a bigger issue here and the 
bigger issue is we in this country have 

2995
01:59:00,881 --> 01:59:04,210
confused healthcare with healthcare 
insurance.

2996
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:05,613
They are two totally separate things.
I don't talk much about healthcare 

2997
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:09,333
insurance that much.
We like cam more about the healthcare 

2998
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:12,730
system itself.
The system itself is broken.

2999
01:59:12,731 --> 01:59:14,290
It's a cartel system,
right?

3000
01:59:14,291 --> 01:59:15,960
So it's literally a people in a room 
getting ready,

3001
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:17,020
get together and go,
Hey,

3002
01:59:17,021 --> 01:59:17,620
what do you think?

3003
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:19,480
A aspirin,
85 bucks.

3004
01:59:19,481 --> 01:59:20,314
When do you think?
Yeah,

3005
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:24,140
85 bucks it is for aspirin and it's not 
based on how much it cost to make it.

3006
01:59:24,141 --> 01:59:25,180
No,
not at all.

3007
01:59:25,330 --> 01:59:27,550
Not at all.
It is a little bit and stuff like that.

3008
01:59:27,551 --> 01:59:29,590
Martin,
what does that little twats name,

3009
01:59:29,591 --> 01:59:31,120
that one up going to jail?
Just corralling.

3010
01:59:31,121 --> 01:59:32,860
Yes.
The Wu Tang clan album,

3011
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:35,720
perfect example.
Jacked up the price of some heart,

3012
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:38,980
some medication in a horrific way.
Perfect example.

3013
01:59:39,070 --> 01:59:40,960
Yes.
That of course is an extreme example,

3014
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:42,340
right?
But that's actually happening.

3015
01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:43,174
If you've ever gone to a hospital or 
going to a doctor's office and you see 

3016
01:59:44,981 --> 01:59:46,000
the PA,
they give you the bill,

3017
01:59:46,030 --> 01:59:47,090
right?
Aspirin,

3018
01:59:47,110 --> 01:59:50,650
85 bucks in a bed for five minutes,
$3,000 right?

3019
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:51,543
I mean they do that,
right?

3020
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:52,393
Right.
And,

3021
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:53,273
and that's a problem in itself.
And one of the reasons is this right 

3022
01:59:55,661 --> 01:59:56,494
now,
healthcare system is the current 

3023
01:59:57,011 --> 01:59:57,844
healthcare system.

3024
01:59:58,180 --> 01:59:59,590
All right,
Joe,

3025
01:59:59,591 --> 02:00:00,424
you decide you when I get a new job and 
you want to get us a new clothes for 

3026
02:00:03,761 --> 02:00:04,930
your job.
So you come to me,

3027
02:00:04,931 --> 02:00:05,860
the Clo there,
Larry,

3028
02:00:05,861 --> 02:00:06,694
and you say,
Hey,

3029
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:07,661
I need some new clothes.
They go,

3030
02:00:07,661 --> 02:00:08,494
great.
Here's some new clothes and I tell you 

3031
02:00:09,191 --> 02:00:11,380
what you going to do and I give you a 
good hat and clothes and everything.

3032
02:00:11,381 --> 02:00:12,820
He got awesome.
You go,

3033
02:00:12,821 --> 02:00:13,900
thanks,
Larry is perfect.

3034
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:15,010
Awesome.
How much it cost.

3035
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:16,620
And I say,
I dunno.

3036
02:00:17,330 --> 02:00:18,163
You said,
wait a minute,

3037
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:19,233
I came to your store,
you gave me the perfect outfit for my 

3038
02:00:20,741 --> 02:00:22,360
new job.
You don't know how much costs.

3039
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:24,100
That's correct.
I don't know what it's perfect.

3040
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:25,960
I don't know how much it costs.
Here's what we're gonna do.

3041
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:26,851
You go home,
take,

3042
02:00:26,851 --> 02:00:28,090
take the close.
It's great for you.

3043
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:30,430
You can get a bill in the mail,
but a week or so,

3044
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:32,830
whatever the bill is,
I don't know what it is you have to pay.

3045
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:36,100
That's our current healthcare system.
Wow.

3046
02:00:36,130 --> 02:00:37,060
That is true.
Yes.

3047
02:00:37,061 --> 02:00:38,320
That's how it works.
And it's true.

3048
02:00:38,350 --> 02:00:39,630
It's only in our system,
right?

3049
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:42,670
You don't do that for a car or clothes 
or a computer thing.

3050
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:44,570
Nothing else.
Only that it's true.

3051
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:45,760
But here's the worst part.
Alright.

3052
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:47,193
Um,
you decided you want to buy this water 

3053
02:00:48,041 --> 02:00:49,360
from me,
right?

3054
02:00:49,430 --> 02:00:51,220
Um,
I'm sorry I missed your name.

3055
02:00:51,550 --> 02:00:53,770
Jamie.
Jamie decides he wants to buy this water

3056
02:00:53,771 --> 02:00:54,581
from you.
I'm calm young.

3057
02:00:54,581 --> 02:00:56,410
Jeremy,
if you want to be a young Jamie Young,

3058
02:00:56,411 --> 02:00:57,244
give him what he wants to buy this water
from you and you agree you want to sell 

3059
02:00:58,631 --> 02:01:01,660
to them for a dollar.
He agrees with them by $4 I step in,

3060
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:02,740
I'm insurance.
Nope,

3061
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:04,053
you cannot have this.
I have deemed as the insurance company 

3062
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:08,560
at this.
This actually is worth 50 cents.

3063
02:01:09,070 --> 02:01:09,903
I've decided so.
So I give him the water so I can try to 

3064
02:01:12,551 --> 02:01:13,810
sell the water for a dollar.

3065
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:15,790
Insurance Company says fuck you.
That's correct.

3066
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:18,250
That's correct.
And gives you this sense done.

3067
02:01:18,490 --> 02:01:20,320
That's a real problem with,
yes,

3068
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:22,060
absolutely.
So up the next piece though,

3069
02:01:22,061 --> 02:01:24,460
now this guy here and he wants to buy 
the water too.

3070
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:27,400
He doesn't have insurance.
I can't get involved.

3071
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:28,533
Will you want to sell the water to them?
How much you wanna sell a word to him 

3072
02:01:30,191 --> 02:01:34,480
now a buck 50 now you gotta make up for 
the sense of him.

3073
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:37,660
So he's paying three times as much.
He's paying.

3074
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:39,980
How do you fix that?
That's the current system.

3075
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:41,900
How would you fix that?
Transparency.

3076
02:01:41,901 --> 02:01:43,940
Transparency,
transparency.

3077
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:46,550
So number one thing trans parents 
offers,

3078
02:01:46,610 --> 02:01:49,760
you broke your foot.
You say a broken foot costs this,

3079
02:01:50,030 --> 02:01:55,030
it costs $50 an hour for that.
It costs 15 cents per pill for this.

3080
02:01:55,730 --> 02:01:57,080
That kind of shit.
Amazing.

3081
02:01:57,081 --> 02:01:59,030
But just,
just doing one thing.

3082
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:01,730
Just saying in New York state,
just saying this,

3083
02:02:02,270 --> 02:02:06,290
if you sell medical services like any 
other service,

3084
02:02:06,710 --> 02:02:07,760
you must be transparent.

3085
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:09,320
Right?
That's it.

3086
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:11,300
That's it.
So you can't just give someone a bill,

3087
02:02:11,330 --> 02:02:12,163
you have to show them why it costs what 
it costs and you have to have a 

3088
02:02:14,691 --> 02:02:17,030
standard.
Absolutely charged them for,

3089
02:02:17,031 --> 02:02:18,800
that's very reasonable.
It's like a car,

3090
02:02:18,801 --> 02:02:19,660
right?
You don't always know much.

3091
02:02:19,661 --> 02:02:20,494
It costs to fix the car.
They give an estimate so you feel like 

3092
02:02:22,671 --> 02:02:23,504
it gives you,
the estimate was just been in place for 

3093
02:02:24,651 --> 02:02:28,400
a long time and they've taken advantage 
of it and they have power and so they're

3094
02:02:28,401 --> 02:02:29,234
just leaving it the way it is.
There's also a bunch of fear and then 

3095
02:02:32,030 --> 02:02:33,290
you have,
this isn't enough,

3096
02:02:33,291 --> 02:02:34,124
right?
This concept of transparency is not 

3097
02:02:34,911 --> 02:02:37,970
enough.
All these problems that we have,

3098
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:38,930
people often say,
well why?

3099
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:41,090
What's the answer?
It's not one thing.

3100
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,820
It's many things.
Transparency is a huge piece,

3101
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:45,770
but you also have to facilitate more 
things.

3102
02:02:45,770 --> 02:02:48,350
As an example.
You want to facilitate an environment to

3103
02:02:48,351 --> 02:02:51,110
where if a,
okay,

3104
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:52,453
the current system people are starting 
to use now is what I call the costco 

3105
02:02:54,531 --> 02:02:56,060
model,
which basically a membership model,

3106
02:02:56,061 --> 02:02:56,894
right?
So the doctor's office has all of us as 

3107
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:00,613
customers,
all of us decided to pay or they agree 

3108
02:03:02,481 --> 02:03:06,020
with what the payment is,
400 bucks a month or you have a kid,

3109
02:03:06,021 --> 02:03:07,810
so you're 800 bucks a month or your 
singles,

3110
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:08,700
you're turning,
whatever the price,

3111
02:03:08,701 --> 02:03:09,534
whatever the price we all pay.
We now can go to that doctor's office 

3112
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:14,210
whenever need to and whoever's in the 
office,

3113
02:03:14,211 --> 02:03:17,630
whatever they have,
we have access to it costs five bucks,

3114
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:18,950
five bucks over it.
That's all.

3115
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:21,710
They try this at zero just doing it 
free.

3116
02:03:21,830 --> 02:03:23,270
But senior citizens,
we show up every day,

3117
02:03:24,020 --> 02:03:26,640
so they charged us that $5 five bucks,
shopify,

3118
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:27,550
bucks and tomato.

3119
02:03:28,010 --> 02:03:31,070
What's the goal of the doctor's office?
The goal of the doctors' offices,

3120
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:33,050
if you to be healthy.
If you didn't have a show up,

3121
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:36,050
just pay you 400 bucks every month and 
to never show up,

3122
02:03:36,051 --> 02:03:37,010
that'd be awesome.
Right?

3123
02:03:37,210 --> 02:03:38,780
Right.
Now that's happening already,

3124
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:40,550
right.
The advantage is whatever they have,

3125
02:03:40,551 --> 02:03:42,710
we get to use.
So if they start making more money,

3126
02:03:42,770 --> 02:03:43,603
they will bring them more doctors.
They will bring them more everything so 

3127
02:03:45,171 --> 02:03:46,004
that you will get more of your family 
and friends to come and pay the monthly 

3128
02:03:47,331 --> 02:03:48,860
fee.
Like a gym membership.

3129
02:03:48,861 --> 02:03:49,760
Same thing,
right?

3130
02:03:49,790 --> 02:03:50,780
As long as healthy,
you're fine.

3131
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:52,033
Well,
what happened is as long as they can 

3132
02:03:53,031 --> 02:03:54,530
help you,
they help you.

3133
02:03:54,650 --> 02:03:55,880
If they can't,
two things.

3134
02:03:55,940 --> 02:03:56,773
You have catastrophic insurance and they
would have some type of agreement with 

3135
02:04:00,321 --> 02:04:01,154
another facility,
like a hospital or something like that 

3136
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:04,790
so that they will get a lower price 
because you're going to them,

3137
02:04:04,791 --> 02:04:05,960
they're sending patients to you.

3138
02:04:05,990 --> 02:04:06,823
Right.
So if you had a bigger issue they can 

3139
02:04:07,611 --> 02:04:08,444
handle.
They have to groom with other 

3140
02:04:09,021 --> 02:04:10,850
facilities,
so you get a little price anyway,

3141
02:04:11,030 --> 02:04:12,890
but you'd have insurance for that 
catastrophic insurance.

3142
02:04:12,891 --> 02:04:13,724
Of course,
we already have sunlight that we have 

3143
02:04:14,991 --> 02:04:16,040
longterm care insurance.
Right.

3144
02:04:16,041 --> 02:04:19,550
Which insurance that when you get 
something that will last a long time,

3145
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:22,070
there are insurances that will help to 
pay along.

3146
02:04:22,071 --> 02:04:24,200
But also,
but more importantly than that,

3147
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:26,660
with that in mind,
we've take care of are,

3148
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:27,550
are,
are,

3149
02:04:27,550 --> 02:04:30,530
are people who are very poor.
So what can we do?

3150
02:04:30,650 --> 02:04:31,483
We can have a system to where you have a
take insurance normally if you want to 

3151
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:37,010
or this system and his an incentive.
If you decide,

3152
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:39,390
say as an example,
and I'm making this up as an example,

3153
02:04:39,391 --> 02:04:41,400
only you know,
10% of your,

3154
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:42,311
uh,
of your,

3155
02:04:42,311 --> 02:04:43,144
uh,
people,

3156
02:04:43,330 --> 02:04:45,210
um,
you will bring on for free.

3157
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:48,150
And based upon how we decide that 
they're poor,

3158
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:50,400
I'm making this up as an idea.
So,

3159
02:04:50,401 --> 02:04:51,420
um,
uh,

3160
02:04:51,450 --> 02:04:52,261
they uh,
they,

3161
02:04:52,261 --> 02:04:53,094
uh,
they are eligible for free school lunch 

3162
02:04:54,151 --> 02:04:54,984
in New York state.
That's how we as New York state will 

3163
02:04:56,401 --> 02:04:59,190
define poor for the sake of argument,
sake of argument.

3164
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:00,323
If Algebra that you take those people,
then we will give you a break on this 

3165
02:05:02,971 --> 02:05:05,520
tax or this fee or this thing.
If you do this,

3166
02:05:06,030 --> 02:05:08,970
many of the smaller doctors,
the break probably won't be enough.

3167
02:05:08,971 --> 02:05:12,270
And they probably won't take it,
but large organizations probably will.

3168
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:16,290
So larger companies will take on people 
who can't afford to pay anything.

3169
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:20,430
This is another idea or concept.
You start making this happen.

3170
02:05:20,431 --> 02:05:21,264
If facility in this and you will see 
health care will get cheaper and when 

3171
02:05:24,421 --> 02:05:28,260
health care gets cheaper now insurance 
gets cheaper.

3172
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:31,290
Now you have more people want to get 
into insurance business,

3173
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:33,240
you will have more options and choices 
for insurance.

3174
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:35,370
You know that people would just get 
emergency room insurance.

3175
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:37,260
Some people just get longterm care 
insurance,

3176
02:05:37,261 --> 02:05:38,430
so maybe we'll just get x,
Y,

3177
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:41,070
z insurance.
How could you reduce the number,

3178
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:42,233
the amount of money rather than 
pharmaceutical drugs cost cause that 

3179
02:05:44,431 --> 02:05:45,480
would be a big issue,
right?

3180
02:05:45,570 --> 02:05:46,740
It would be.
Absolutely.

3181
02:05:46,741 --> 02:05:49,110
Now there are several things.
One of course is the FDA.

3182
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:50,573
The FDA stifles so much,
I mean at the end to be completely 

3183
02:05:52,771 --> 02:05:53,604
rebooted.
I can't really do that in New York 

3184
02:05:54,001 --> 02:05:54,890
state.
That's the thing.

3185
02:05:54,910 --> 02:05:55,743
The government,
the state government we can't do much 

3186
02:05:56,851 --> 02:05:57,684
of.
All I can do is make it forced them to 

3187
02:05:58,861 --> 02:06:00,630
be transparent so that people see how 
bad it is.

3188
02:06:00,990 --> 02:06:03,150
As a general rule,
and this isn't a hundred percent rule,

3189
02:06:03,151 --> 02:06:06,210
but general rule is when you shine a 
light on bad behavior,

3190
02:06:06,510 --> 02:06:07,343
almost though what you can make the bad 
behavior less so when it has to be 

3191
02:06:09,721 --> 02:06:10,554
transparent and when you actually see 
each pill costs all this money and 

3192
02:06:13,461 --> 02:06:14,790
enough people go,
dude,

3193
02:06:14,791 --> 02:06:16,590
what are you doing right enough?

3194
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:17,670
Go,
what are you doing?

3195
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:21,480
I'm not doing this and it will force 
them to change,

3196
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:24,780
but that's a longterm solution.
That is really a federal issue.

3197
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:25,831
Well,
listen,

3198
02:06:25,831 --> 02:06:27,840
Larry,
you got some really good ideas.

3199
02:06:27,841 --> 02:06:30,230
They're very revolutionary.
You're a bold motherfuckers.

3200
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:31,470
The goal,
some chances.

3201
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:32,453
Absolutely.
I like the fact that you're sticking 

3202
02:06:34,441 --> 02:06:37,470
your neck out there with a lot of these 
things and I hope we do well.

3203
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:39,720
Let me wrap the last piece he's do.
If,

3204
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:41,370
if,
if I don't win,

3205
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:43,590
if you don't win,
if I win,

3206
02:06:43,620 --> 02:06:47,430
it changed this nation overnight.
100% because all the ideas pop up,

3207
02:06:47,431 --> 02:06:49,800
things will change.
You will see people who are independent.

3208
02:06:49,950 --> 02:06:50,783
Step Up.
You'll see libertarians change to be in 

3209
02:06:53,191 --> 02:06:55,260
the debates.
I just be popular.

3210
02:06:55,590 --> 02:06:56,423
That's it.
That's it.

3211
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:59,670
How much do you have to be?
Probably what has to be decided and they

3212
02:06:59,671 --> 02:07:01,290
just decide who designs.

3213
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:02,153
Is there a committee?
I think presidential thing is cuomo 

3214
02:07:05,401 --> 02:07:08,250
decides if he wants to show up or not.
That's it.

3215
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:09,750
Yes.
And when he does is he says,

3216
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:12,750
follow my rules and I'll show up.
What does his rules,

3217
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:14,370
whatever he feels it's appropriate.
Really?

3218
02:07:14,371 --> 02:07:15,210
Yes.
Him To do that.

3219
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:15,960
Yeah.
Oh,

3220
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:18,870
he won't show he did with Nixon.
He said it has to be sit down,

3221
02:07:18,871 --> 02:07:19,970
must be here,
must be there.

3222
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:20,940
She said yes,
he showed up.

3223
02:07:21,330 --> 02:07:24,330
So he'll have his rules.
I'll say yes and I'll show up.

3224
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:27,290
What will he do that with you?
I don't know.

3225
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:31,080
I think he will in the last three,
last two times he did it.

3226
02:07:31,081 --> 02:07:34,080
He did all that.
All four people showed up last.

3227
02:07:34,081 --> 02:07:34,914
Well,
good for him.

3228
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:36,070
Yes.
Last time we did it.

3229
02:07:36,071 --> 02:07:36,791
Yes.
So probably,

3230
02:07:36,791 --> 02:07:38,470
well,
when would this possibly happen?

3231
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:40,000
October.
October?

3232
02:07:40,001 --> 02:07:42,400
Yes.
And we could promote that.

3233
02:07:42,450 --> 02:07:44,250
We can tell people about.
Absolutely.

3234
02:07:44,550 --> 02:07:45,383
Um,
what would be the key things that you 

3235
02:07:47,801 --> 02:07:50,620
and him would butt heads on?
Wow.

3236
02:07:50,621 --> 02:07:52,010
So much.
Um,

3237
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:53,950
as a general rule,
the biggest thing is,

3238
02:07:54,190 --> 02:07:56,200
um,
the states collapsing and he doesn't say

3239
02:07:56,201 --> 02:07:57,034
that.
He says the states awesome because we 

3240
02:07:59,111 --> 02:08:01,480
have great gun control.
It's what he says.

3241
02:08:02,170 --> 02:08:03,003
He's worried about fighting trump.
He thinks fighting trump has everything 

3242
02:08:04,781 --> 02:08:06,940
because he's running for president 20,
20 a.

3243
02:08:06,941 --> 02:08:10,990
So his entire campaign is,
I'm the only one who can beat trump.

3244
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:13,660
I'm the only one who can protect New 
York state from trump.

3245
02:08:13,690 --> 02:08:17,350
And if he loses the governorship,
he's fucked.

3246
02:08:17,410 --> 02:08:19,210
Running for president.
I don't know.

3247
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:20,890
It depends on Democrats think.
I mean,

3248
02:08:20,891 --> 02:08:21,760
you know,
it depends.

3249
02:08:21,790 --> 02:08:24,610
Some Democrats who depends on who wants 
to fight trump in 2020.

3250
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:25,773
If trump is very popular,
a lot of Democrats won't want to fight 

3251
02:08:28,421 --> 02:08:29,290
them,
but Como,

3252
02:08:29,291 --> 02:08:30,880
well,
who else is going to run?

3253
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:32,590
What do you mean?
For my twenties,

3254
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:34,990
as a democrat?
Is Hillary running again?

3255
02:08:35,050 --> 02:08:36,910
I don't know.
It seems like she is right.

3256
02:08:36,970 --> 02:08:38,920
Maybe it seems like Bernie might run 
again.

3257
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:40,150
He might.
Yeah.

3258
02:08:40,290 --> 02:08:41,550
I don't know.
There's a lot of Mites,

3259
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:43,780
so I don't really know.
It hit his loss.

3260
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:45,910
Might mean that he,
uh,

3261
02:08:45,970 --> 02:08:49,420
that he doesn't run vote if you win 
changes the entire nation,

3262
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:50,673
not just that you will find people who 
are liberty leaning all of a sudden 

3263
02:08:53,021 --> 02:08:54,920
running the libertarian banner.
Because I'm,

3264
02:08:54,970 --> 02:08:55,803
I'm,
I'm right now the most popular guy 

3265
02:08:57,701 --> 02:08:58,534
running who has an l buys name.
There are some libertarians who are 

3266
02:09:00,161 --> 02:09:01,150
running who don't have els by their 
name.

3267
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:02,073
They're running a nonpartisan racist.
I'm running boldly with an elbow by my 

3268
02:09:04,271 --> 02:09:04,901
name,
right?

3269
02:09:04,901 --> 02:09:07,090
So I'm trying to change the brand.
So it's a decent brand.

3270
02:09:07,091 --> 02:09:07,924
It's what I'm doing.
Are you putting the betraying all my 

3271
02:09:08,711 --> 02:09:09,190
stuff?

3272
02:09:09,190 --> 02:09:10,023
I'm always libertarian,
so I'm trying to build the brand out to 

3273
02:09:13,001 --> 02:09:13,834
be a better brand.
So if I win the brands better people 

3274
02:09:17,081 --> 02:09:18,310
would do that,
will raise my money,

3275
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:19,750
there'll be a real third party.
I mean,

3276
02:09:19,751 --> 02:09:21,370
there'll be a third party in the United 
States,

3277
02:09:21,371 --> 02:09:22,204
which will make better democrats and 
better republicans will literally be a 

3278
02:09:24,161 --> 02:09:25,450
better nation,
a better pr.

3279
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:29,920
A politic will be better in in America 
if I actually win this damn thing.

3280
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:31,353
But let's say I lose Sam wrong.
My things in my mind is a wrong 

3281
02:09:33,281 --> 02:09:34,011
whatever.
People want gray,

3282
02:09:34,011 --> 02:09:35,710
I lose.
It doesn't matter.

3283
02:09:35,860 --> 02:09:39,610
The bold ideas are still out there.
What you heard,

3284
02:09:39,611 --> 02:09:43,180
what your audience hurt is still there.
Someone's going to pick this up,

3285
02:09:43,181 --> 02:09:45,610
some of us in a talk about it,
and if you're fine with that,

3286
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:48,220
100% what?
Yes,

3287
02:09:48,221 --> 02:09:49,054
please.
I want to fix things I'm not concerned 

3288
02:09:51,820 --> 02:09:53,170
with who gets the credit for it.

3289
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:55,870
Let's fix it.
I want a better place to live.

3290
02:09:56,140 --> 02:09:56,973
This cutters in trouble.
Neil's gets a perfect example of where 

3291
02:09:59,291 --> 02:10:01,090
we're going.
I don't want that to be the rest of this

3292
02:10:01,091 --> 02:10:02,590
nation.
We can fix,

3293
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:05,290
steal all my stuff.
Please steal it all.

3294
02:10:05,350 --> 02:10:06,520
Awesome.
I hope you steal it.

3295
02:10:06,550 --> 02:10:09,610
I hope California copies me and does 
everything I said it'd be amazing.

3296
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:10,900
Please do that.
It'd be awesome,

3297
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:13,900
but if people don't hear me,
if I don't get out there,

3298
02:10:13,901 --> 02:10:16,270
if I don't get debate stage and I don't 
come in second or third,

3299
02:10:16,570 --> 02:10:18,520
then no one's going to hear me because 
I'm going to be forgotten.

3300
02:10:19,030 --> 02:10:21,040
But if I come in second or a tight 
third,

3301
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:21,993
there'll be a microphone in my face for 
the next two years and every time it's 

3302
02:10:24,461 --> 02:10:27,550
out there,
I'd be saying stuff just like this again

3303
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:28,533
and again and again,
and maybe my education system isn't 

3304
02:10:30,781 --> 02:10:32,050
perfect,
but guess what?

3305
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:33,830
Someone will figure out the right.
It won't be.

3306
02:10:33,831 --> 02:10:36,440
Just keep giving it money.
It won't be that.

3307
02:10:36,770 --> 02:10:40,580
It'll be something I'll actually work.
It'd be something brand new and exciting

3308
02:10:40,730 --> 02:10:42,170
and get people to come back to our 
state.

3309
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:45,500
What I don't want is what's happening 
now is kids get educated,

3310
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:46,513
they leave,
they don't come back with the edge here 

3311
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:50,570
someplace else and never come back.
It's the wrong answer.

3312
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:52,543
Good luck to you,
Larry.

3313
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:55,940
Larry Sharp,
ladies and gentlemen,

3314
02:10:56,060 --> 02:10:57,560
the revolution has just begun.
