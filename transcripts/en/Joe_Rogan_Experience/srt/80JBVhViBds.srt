1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,571
Trey,

2
00:00:00,571 --> 00:00:03,720
my daddy Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day,

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,130
you know,

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,360
or things they disagree with.

5
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:07,410
It's like there's a lot of,

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,150
a lot riding on every aspect of fighting.

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,920
Like do you see the Bernard Hopkins fight?

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:14,851
Sad,

9
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:15,684
right.

10
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,673
That was sad.

11
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,001
Bernard Hopkins,

12
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,280
if 51 years old fought this
kid named Joe Smith Jr.

13
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,150
If nobody's seen Joe Smith junior before,

14
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:24,870
he's fucking,

15
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,740
he's a killer.

16
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,150
Like Bernard Hopkins picked a killer and
this kid fucked him up and his kid has

17
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,470
extra long arms.

18
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,650
He's got weird arms like
his arms go below his waist.

19
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,570
I was watched him fine.

20
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,060
It was like look at the
length of his fucking arms.

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,140
Like he just,

22
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,230
he beat the shit out of Bernard and he
knocked him out of the ring and Bernard

23
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,400
caught them with some good shots.

24
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,220
He was timing them and he caught him
with a few right hands with the kid was

25
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:48,780
just eating them and moving forward.

26
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,040
And you know what it looks like.

27
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,570
It's like when people have fake hands,

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
like the fake hand is like
sticking through the shirt sleeve.

29
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:55,471
Yeah.

30
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:58,290
He almost looked like a cartoon
guy with his extra long arms,

31
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,580
but he's a bad motherfucker.

32
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:03,570
That guy and Bernard got knocked
through the ropes and fell on his head.

33
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,910
It was crazy to watch and he got up,

34
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:07,110
he was all disoriented,

35
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,100
didn't know what happened,

36
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,450
thought he was pushed through the ropes,

37
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:13,950
but he was punched through the ropes
that got connected with like four or five

38
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,770
big shots and,

39
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,860
and the last one was a left hook on the
face as Bernard was going through the

40
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:22,380
ropes and it knocked
him all the way through,

41
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,540
but it was 100% legal.

42
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,770
He didn't do anything wrong.

43
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:26,910
He did everything with punches.

44
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,121
It would,

45
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,110
none of it was a push.

46
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,380
He was just bombing on him and
it just was a freak incident.

47
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,980
It's one of the reasons why cages
are so much better than a ring.

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,120
A cage is so superior,

49
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,111
like a ring.

50
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:37,761
It's like that,

51
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:38,100
that,

52
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,440
that possibility that you
could fall through like that.

53
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,550
That's terrible.

54
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,361
That should,

55
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:45,660
they should stop using rings
and if they do use rings,

56
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,970
they should pad the shit
out of the outside area.

57
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:52,260
The fact that someone like Bernard
Hopkins who's been boxing for forever can

58
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:56,370
still get knocked through a rope like
that and land on his head that that's a

59
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:56,911
possibility.

60
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:01,890
That's a stupid way of containing people
they should have instead of ropes like

61
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:02,760
that would,

62
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:06,210
they should have is something that has
a criss cross pattern or you can't go

63
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:10,050
through it and you should have to
just climb over it to get in it.

64
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:13,230
It should be real simple and it should
be a way that they could release the,

65
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:13,411
uh,

66
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:14,244
the ropes.

67
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,260
Like if there was a medical
emergency at the end of the fight,

68
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,190
it should be like a latch.

69
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:19,740
They could pull and drop the
ribs down and get somebody out.

70
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,420
But the ropes,

71
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:23,250
the way they use them
now in boxing matches,

72
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:24,990
they should fucking outlaw those.

73
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,620
The fact that Bernard Hopkins can
get knocked through one like that,

74
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,490
that's,

75
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,510
or the very least,

76
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:31,950
you've got to protect the outside area.

77
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,320
You got to pad the shit out
of it and you had to have,

78
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,870
he should have people
around and most of the time,

79
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,850
a thousand fights in a row.

80
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:40,890
It's probably never
going to come into play,

81
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,300
but the one time it does,

82
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,760
you're responsible for that
guy falling through the ropes.

83
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:45,900
That's fucking stupid.

84
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,093
Like lizard.

85
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,820
He goes flying through men.

86
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,070
Look,

87
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,510
it'll lengthen that kids'
arms so it doesn't look,

88
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:54,330
it looks Photoshop like his head
is not the right size or something.

89
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,810
He's a,

90
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,591
he's built for it.

91
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:56,424
I'll tell you that.

92
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,650
He's got great genetics and works hard.

93
00:02:58,651 --> 00:02:59,321
Tough kid.

94
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:00,160
Really good fighter.

95
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,060
Good Chin Line.

96
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,171
I liked that,

97
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:02,950
huh?

98
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,161
Yeah,

99
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:03,994
he's an animal.

100
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:04,721
I was,

101
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:08,470
I was super impressed with his poise to
in fighting a guy like Bernard Hopkins.

102
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:13,300
I mean that guy stepped up in a big way
and he was a two to 100 dog leaning into

103
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:13,871
that fight,

104
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:14,920
which is really crazy.

105
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,260
WHATSAPP commit some money on that.

106
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:17,480
Sure,

107
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,190
yeah.

108
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,431
Yeah.

109
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,020
I was pretty convinced that uh,

110
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,020
Bernard was going to be
able to stifle him and uh,

111
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,560
turn it into like the kind
of fight that Bernard likes.

112
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,300
But I wasn't sure if Bernard could win.

113
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:28,511
You know,

114
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:29,440
it's a long time off.

115
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,470
Two years when you're 51 years old.

116
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,470
It's a long time off.

117
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,453
He still fought.

118
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,443
Amazing.

119
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,550
But at the end of the
day that kid marked him,

120
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:37,990
he just was,

121
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,700
he was just too much and he was,

122
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:40,300
he's,

123
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,300
he's a guy that would have been a real
threat at any time in anyone's career.

124
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,180
Like he's,

125
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,110
this kid has real talent and right now
he's not thought of as being the best

126
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:52,750
fighter in the world or
anything even close like that.

127
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,340
But Bernard was at one point in time,

128
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:54,791
Bernard,

129
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,260
like when he beat Felix Trinidad,

130
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,830
a lot of people were saying that might
be the best pound for pound box or on the

131
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:00,190
earth.

132
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,290
Like a lot of people thought
Trinidad was going to beat him.

133
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,520
He fucked Trinidad up.

134
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,110
And then he fought Kelly Pavlick and a
lot of people wrote him off against Kelly

135
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,410
Pavlik.

136
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,660
He box the shit out of Kelly Pavlick.

137
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,450
And so you look at like
Bernard's legacy and you go,

138
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:13,631
man,

139
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:15,520
this is an unbelievably skillful guy.

140
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,170
But at any point in that career that
Joe Kelly kid would have been a handful,

141
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,220
he's just scary.

142
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:21,910
He's,

143
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,511
or Joe Smith,

144
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:23,200
rather,

145
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,470
that Joe Smith junior kid would have
been a handful because he's just fucking

146
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:27,304
scary.

147
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,710
He hits hard and he's,

148
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,880
he's super accurate and he's got awesome
endurance and a great work ethic.

149
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,580
He's fucking dangerous
no matter what era it is.

150
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,833
And Bernard,

151
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,230
you know,

152
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,660
maybe Bernard would have
been able to beat him in his,

153
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,620
in his prime.

154
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,280
You know,

155
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,570
it's totally possible.

156
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,700
It's 100% likely.

157
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,271
I mean,

158
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:47,110
Bernard's and all time.

159
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:47,441
Great.

160
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:50,380
Maybe it would have been able to land
more of the punches that he landed in that

161
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:50,980
fight.

162
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,813
But you don't know.

163
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,051
I mean,

164
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:53,381
that kids,

165
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:54,430
