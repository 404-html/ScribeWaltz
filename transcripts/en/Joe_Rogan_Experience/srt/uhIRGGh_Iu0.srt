00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,020
Good Lord, brothers and
sisters of the universe. We're

This podcast is supported by many find
sponsors. Let's get into him right quick.

3
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:15,630
Number One, first and foremost we're

6
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:26,040
a website that has evolved and grown from
the birth of this podcast. It's sent,

7
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,340
essentially caused the business to form.
Um,

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,370
what it's about is selling what we
deem to be items that enhance human

9
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:39,000
performance, enhance your physical
performance, your mental performance,

you healthy choices as far as uh,

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,590

strength and conditioning equipment.

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,830
We sell kettlebells and steel maces
and ab wheels and medicine balls,

13
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:54,540
all these different
things like weight vest,

14
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,270
things that really enhanced
functional strength. Um,

15
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:58,770
if you've never done kettlebells before,

16
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,900
it is a fantastic series of videos that
are available at [inaudible] dot com. Um,

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,450
and if you've done it a few times,
do you understand the form?

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,190
The best one is Keith Weber's
extreme kettlebell cardio workouts.

19
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:13,590
They're fantastic cause there's
a lot of kettle bell DVDs.

20
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:15,990
It'll show you like how to
do the individual exercises,

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,990
but they don't do the workout with you
and like make you keep up with them. Uh,

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,190
I just actually have been going back
and forth with Keith, Keith Weber,

23
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:27,030
so he's going to be on the podcast a in
October. I'm very excited about that.

24
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:30,480
I really want to talk to him cause his,
uh, his workout DVDs or like I said,

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,410
my favorite, if you thinking about doing
anything like this, please start slow.

26
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,870
If you've never worked out and you smoked
cigarettes and you're always drunk,

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,060
do me a favor,
please start slow.

28
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:43,200
Don't be dropping a fucking big 72 pound
gorilla kettle bell in your head cause

29
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:46,080
you getting crazy and you're trying to
do it all in one day. It takes time.

30
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,640
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com o.

31
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,670
N n I t use the code word Rogan and save
10% off any an all supplements and a,

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,790
this just didn't, we just got
in and were drinking it now, uh,

33
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,380
on it caveman coffee,

34
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,940
this is our friend Keith Jardine and
Tate have created this company called

35
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:07,180
Caveman coffee cause they're
both fucking cave men and uh, uh,

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,620
they have a relationship with a
guy who grows coffee in Colombia.

37
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:15,570
His family grows coffee and they, they
go direct to, it's a single source, um,

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,080
a farm. So it's kind of interesting. Um,

39
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,040
just by happenstance because Tate is a,
takes a big coffee fanatic.

40
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,320
Always has been that dude ever
since we've met him. Wouldn't,

41
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,000
he wouldn't go anywhere without a
Venti Starbucks in his hand. You know,

42
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,990
he quit alcohol and drugs and went right
to coffee. That will, that happens man.

43
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,800
Those dudes that are on the program,
they're in like a 12 step program.

44
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:41,190
They love their coffee cause it's
gives you a little bit of a buzz,

45
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:42,870
but nobody has to get crazy and you,

46
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,870
so you satisfy a little bit of those
demons and keep everything cool.

47
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,500
You're giving yourself a little something
something, but it's not fucking you up.

48
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,240
So those guys love coffee.

49
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:54,170
It's very rarely see like
alcoholics anonymous dude who uh,

50
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,600
although you're not anonymous, if you
tell everybody sober by the way, right?

51
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,040
I wonder, do these people
awesome. Move on to other

52
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,940
things like s like sniffing markers.
Now you can't do anything like that.

53
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,310
You're not supposed to do anything that's,
you know,

54
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,610
what would be the word
for it? Twisted. You know,

55
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:13,960
anything where you're feeding some,
some more caffeine. Is that kind of,

56
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,320
all these guys are addicted to Red Bulls,
but that's not markers.

57
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:20,890
That's not like huffing paint. Yeah, I
guess which one is more dangerous? Oh,

58
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,450
without a doubt.
Hustling caught a big mess.

59
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,140
It's actually good for you
or about sniffing played out
and people who deny this.

60
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,150
Listen,
you have to read some articles on this.

61
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:34,750
It appears that coffee
has a lot of functions,

62
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,850
a lot of benefits. You know what it
is? It's like every fucking thing else.

63
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,140
You can overdo it. You can overdo it.
You can drink coffee all fucking day,

64
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,970
every dangerous torch,
your adrenals.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,690
Just Jack your system or you can
have a little bit of it every day.

66
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,980
It has. Um, it gives you a
stimulant effect on top of that.

67
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:58,030
It's a rich in antioxidants. It's like
a lot of good things about coffee.

68
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:59,920
Believe it or not,
it's actually not bad for you.

69
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,280
We used to think it was bad for you.
What's bad for you is dehydration,

70
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,790
but if you drink coffee and you still
drink water and keep yourself in order,

71
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,160
just crazy bitches.
Anyway,

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,140
go to [inaudible] Dot com o n n I t use
the Codeword Rogan and save 10% off any

73

We are also brought to you by nature box
o and ms pat is eating some naturebox

75
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,770
right now and she can attest to
the yumminess with this product.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,630
They're very good. Everything's
good. The whole deal.

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,790
Natural nuts to salt mango,
almond pistachios, kapow.

78
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,910
These are lemon pluckers but
Stassi yellows. Yeah, these, Oh,

79
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:42,340
they're mango almond bites. That's what
they are. These are fucking delicious,

80
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,070
but the best is Sriracha cashews.
Nothing can fuck with them.

81
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,760
They're all gone when you just have them.
Just send me boxes of Sriracha. Cashews.

82
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,940
If they're listening. Can I
have one? I have one request.

83
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,970
Can you order like I just want to order
four packs of the cashews but it won't

84
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,860
let you, they won't let you order
for yeah, like I want to be able to,

85
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:03,970
and it gives you like a stopping point
where you can only order like three extra

86
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,790
snacks and then like you
can only order total of,

87
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:11,420
I think it's like 10 like we'll have to
move into that but let's not focus on

88
00:05:11,421 --> 00:05:14,980
the negative. I'm just saying
cause what? I used my box so fast,

89
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,470
I just want to order more. Yeah,
we'll order more boxes. I don't know.

90
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:21,520
I don't know what to say. I
haven't noticed that. That's,
that's fucked up though.

91
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,300
You should be able to order like 50 boxes
of just Sriracha. Cashews only. Yeah.

92
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,040
And I want it once a week and I have
it once a week and won't get the once a

93
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,490
week. It doesn't, unless it's
really confusing to do that.

94
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:33,070
You think they would want to add? You've
got to check this before you say it.

95
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,800
And you know that you can't do it.
I've tried it a million times.

96
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,720
They won't let you order one a week.
Yeah.

97
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,790
Why do I have a feeling that
we're going to find out?

98
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,170
It's really easy to order one a
week. It might be, but I tried. Okay.

99
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,850
Nature box anyway is very
good and it was really good.

100
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,500
Um, the, the problem is that
you can't get enough. Exactly.

101
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,150
Mine goes through in three days
and that's what the total addition,

102
00:05:56,151 --> 00:06:01,151
she'd go to a supermarket and get actual
foods can actually be living off of

103
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:05,240
this. You can't, it's not
enough calories. You need more.

104
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:09,420
Otherwise you're go retarded Cheddar
potato fries and what your problem is when

105
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,800
you just, you're just not getting enough
nutrients. I just can't leave the house.

106
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,753
That too.

107
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,570
Anyway, they're delicious.
Zero Trans Fats,

108
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,980
zero high fructose corn syrup and a, you
could get snacks that are low in sugar,

109
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,510
a non Gmo and without gluten and they
shipped for free. It's good shit man.

110
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,060
It's really good stuff. Peanut
butter, nom nom is a really good,

111
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,460
do you ever have those
baked sweet potato fries?

112
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,940
A lot of healthy choices to a lot of
choices where you don't feel bad eating

113
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:34,720
them at all.

114
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,050
And it's so much better than the shit
that you're going to get from any vending

115
00:06:38,051 --> 00:06:42,400
machine, period. So if you keep me at
work, it's a fantastic option. You know,

116
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,970
you'll always have a healthy
snacks and they deliver them to.

117
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,500

122

naturebox.com/rogan Chili lime pistachios.

123
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,920
Those are good too.
But I'll tell you what,

124
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:16,530
I have a grievance with
them to then cause uh,

125
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,860
there's a supermarket near my house,
it's house pistachios out of the shells.

126
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,110
And once you eat pistachios
out of the shells, you're like,

127
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,440
why are you giving me any stupid fucking
shells and pretending this is a big bag

128
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:28,950
of pistachios? No, this is a big
bag of shit I can't eat that.

129
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:31,500
You expect me to take out before I eat.

130
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,640
How about you just give me the fucking
pistachios. I have shells all over my bed.

131
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,540
Suck it before you. It's not,
it's overrated. Crawfish. I,

132
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,370
yeah, those are good. Those are delicious.

133
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:51,240
Don't get me wrong. I'll take
them over. Nothing. However,

134
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,240
the best option is when they're
already out of the shell.

135
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,980
Then you just eat the shit out of them.

136
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:58,530
You can't believe how many pistachios
you get in your fucking face.

137
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,270
They call some more. Yeah, they
definitely costs more, but it's just,

138
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,940
it's one of those things and
we've just come accustomed to,

139
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:08,790
it's stupid that you got a shell on that.
It just shells not helping anybody.

140
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,400
Naturebox,

141
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,280
they'd have a nature bucket of just these
roasters like Saracha roasted cashews.

142
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,120
I will, I will pay 40 bucks a
month if I get a bucket. Eddie's,

143
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,560
I could get Tuckey fried chicken
size buckets, nature bucket.

144
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,810
Anyway, naturebox.com/rogan
go there, enjoy and a last

145
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,320
and finally we brought to
you by stamps.com stamps.com
is another awesome way to

146
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,650
stay inside your house. That's what
we're promoting ladies and gentlemen.

147
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,840
Essentially we just want you to stay home
and consume Internet content and lose

148
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:40,740
your fucking mind.

149
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,370
But if you go to stamps.com and click
on the microphone and enter in the code

150
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,860
word j r e you will

151
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:57,630
which includes a digital scale and
up to $5 worth of free postage with

152
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:02,631
stamps.com is is a way where you
can print from your own computer,

153
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,080
you s postage,
the real deal.

154
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,320
You never have to go to a post office
again if you have your own business,

155
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,020
like Brian does a desk,

156
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:16,060
squad.tv where he sells all those cool
kitty cat tee shirts and now hats,

157
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,360
those hats, all kinds of groovy
shit. Um, hoodies, right? Yep.

158
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,190
Put his house up until 5:00
AM shipping these from stamps.

159
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,130
Yeah, he really does have a
legit job with stamps.com um,

160
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,640
and what they do is,
you know,

161
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,800
they have it so that you do
everything on your computer,

162
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:34,000
your printed up with your printer,

163
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,760
you slap those babies on your
boxes and you send them out.

164
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,210
How much easier is it then going to the
supermarket, supermarket, I mean brother

165
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,640
so easy. I thought I couldn't even
fit it in my car. What I have to do,

166
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,330
like I would have to take four trips to
the post office now I can just do it on

167
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:51,510
stamps.com then have the,
the mailman just pick it up.

168
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,070
If you were less or if you were
just slightly more organized,

169
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:58,200
you could have an actual business with
all these t shirts, right? You're just,

170
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,750
you're,
you have to do it by herself.

171
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:03,830
And it's almost like I'm watching one
of those old time wagon wheels go down a

172
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:06,560
hill and I'm like, God,
it's rolling right now.

173
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:09,850
But I used to get a be before
they fucking thing. It's

174
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,810
if you look at my house right now,

175
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,930
because I moved all of the merge to my
house now and I'm doing it all from my

176
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:15,471
living room,

177
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:19,560
it looks like I'm a psycho and it
looks like my bed is just fucking the

178
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,540
pistachio shells and in my living
room it's just boxes, shirts and buy.

179
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,453
Like yes,

180
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,670
it's time to hire employees,
man. It's time to hire employees.

181
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,520
Take this shit to the next level.
How dare you.

182
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,630
Without stamps.com he would be dead.
There would be no time for him to eat,

183
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:37,910
breathe and drink water and
he would have died long ago.

184
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,770
But with stamps.com Brian has been able
to maintain a healthy business anyway,

185
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,390
go to stamps.com again entering the
code word jre and you will get a free

186
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:50,630
digital scale and up to 55
bucks where the free postage,

187
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,080
if you have an idea in your head and
you're thinking about starting a business,

188
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,760
if you actually do it,
it will make your life infinitely better.

189
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,140
If you could figure out a way to get off
the tit of whatever giant company you

190
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:06,590
work for that doesn't give a fuck about
you and replace you with somebody else

191
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:10,070
in a heartbeat and figure out
something you like to do, man.

192
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,210
Like if you like to make fucking corn
cob pipes or something, if you like to,

193
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,280
you know whatever you like to do.

194
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:21,281
There's a way that someone can sell things
online that just didn't exist before

195
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,940
and maybe it's just something you never
considered but brainstorm seriously,

196
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:28,970
brainstorm. Come up with a
business. You can start yourself.

197
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,070
You could do it with Squarespace and
stamps.com and you would be just sat.

198
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,450
You could actually work for yourself and
you'll get to a point where you'll feel

199
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:42,770
comfortable enough to quit that Janky
ass fucking job that's been weighing down

200
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:43,410
your soul.

201
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,660
It doesn't even have to be a job.

202
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:48,440
One of the weirdest things is that I'd
never use the post office because it was

203
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:53,350
such a pain in the ass to send like my
family shit back home or my friends and

204
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:53,950
stuff.

205
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,030
You just have to put it shit in a box and
it costs like $8 for them to get it in

206
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:01,400
two days and they come and pick
it up and you're trying to work.

207
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,750
So now I'm just sending shit all the time
to friends and stuff just because it's

208
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,200
like seriously super cheap. Like, Oh
hey, have some shit. Hey, here's this.

209
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,950
Yeah, you get a lot of swag. Right?

210
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,400
She always getting things like most
getting t shirts and I'm not going to wear

211
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,800
right books and I'm not
going to read. Exactly. Yeah.

212
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:19,410
It's cool if you could share that shit
to be able to do it through stamps.com

213
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,490
anytime.
Look,

214
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:25,200
the idea of the post office or you
know any company that sends you things,

215
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:26,190
it's ridiculous.

216
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,910
You're going to give you someone how
much I've got to give you 80 bucks and

217
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:33,410
you're going to take some shit that
weighs 20 pounds across the country. Yeah.

218
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,380
What the fuck is that? That's
ridiculous. Ridiculous. It's amazing.

219
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,580
Like people used to complain about
stamps when a stamp was like 35 cents,

220
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,790
you know, we to 35 cents,
I snuck in 35 cents.

221
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,940
Someone's going to take your letter and
they're going to bring it to another

222
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:50,970
part of the world.
Like that's amazing.

223
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,390
They're going to take it to the other
side of the continent and it only costs 35

224
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,560
cents and you're whining. You
fucking lazy. Spoiled Bitch.

225
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,680
Yeah.
I love the future shit.

226
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:05,681
Like this is a great example of a
website taking something that sucked and

227
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:09,050
making it so much better
and so much easier to where
you could take advantage of

228
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:11,630
the u sps, you know, for like, you know,

229
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,010
sending stuff to your parents for cheap
and not having to deal with taking it to

230
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:19,040
the post office waiting in line
to where it's becomes a chore.

231
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,960
Yeah. We have a bunch of
our friends who use it, Tom,

232
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,350
her and Christina budgets to
use stamps.com Bert uses it.

233
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,470
Christ your uses it for Bert, Bert, Bert,
all all his shit or squirt dot. Yeah.

234
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,200
Does Joe use it for his toe?
Probably. Anyway, stamps.com go there.

235
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,273
Get your freak on.

236
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,500
Use the cohort are saved them some
money and enjoy a nice product.

237
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,040
All right, miss pat is here. Why
fuck around Brian Cuban music. Don't,

238
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,280
don't fuck with Nick Diaz,
his voice today. Very

239
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,973
Gotcha.

240
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,270
Gotcha.
Some respect experience.

241
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,510
Try my day. Joe Rogan
podcast by night. Thank you.

242
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,340
Yeah, so I want to fuck with his boy.
He just signed to fight Anderson Silva.

243
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,260
Oh Miss Pat. No, I, if I did
not have you on this podcast,

244
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:04,480
I would have never heard the end of it.
Jesus fucking Christ.

245
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:06,400
I don't know what you've
done those other podcasts,

246
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:09,160
but all I keep hearing it's dude,
you got to get ms Pat.

247
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:13,030
You got to get ms Pat like more than
any recent comedian I could think of in

248
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:16,030
like the past two years,
people have been trying to get you

249
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,020
what's going on for him. I
don't know what, what's that
about? What are you doing?

250
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,910
What are you doing?
Like a big old black lady,

251
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:23,680
I guess they think I'm
their nanny and shit.

252
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,160
Well, what I keep hearing as a comparison
to you and my favorite person ever,

253
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:31,090
Joey Diaz, everybody keeps saying that
you're a female Joey Diaz, which is,

254
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,410
there is no better description
for a comedian that exists in my,

255
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,240
I mean, we shaped the light
ball foul daddy left us.

256
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,190
He's similar. Yeah, and you
both don't give a fuck. I
don't give a fuck about shit.

257
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,980
Life is too short to give a fuck.
It is too short.

258
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,680
I got four kids and two abortions.
I give a fuck.

259
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,200
You can't keep them all.

260
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,340
Yeah. You can't keep 'em all
this times to do things at times.

261
00:14:57,341 --> 00:15:02,170
Not as exactly abortionists
it's a hot topic.

262
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,410
That's a, that's a fucking, uh, it takes
the air out of the room. You fear it.

263
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,513
You feel that.

264
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,930
So the two abortion smoker,
we refer. How dare you,

265
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,200
how dare you implicate us
in illegal drug use. Hey,

266
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:18,500
I'm might have out of soccer moms
caught writing me, how dare you bitch.

267
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:22,010
That was 20 years ago called Jesus.
Don't call me and leave me the fuck alone.

268
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,990
Say, how dare you. If you were white,

269
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:28,330
they might owe a lot of those republican
soccer moms that are really anti

270
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:29,050
abortion.

271
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,410
Yeah. Black people outside of Bush
and clean. They'd be like, girlfriend,

272
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:37,730
I feel you. I feel you my
appointment next week. Bitch,

273
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,480
there's a weird vacancy.
Their eyes,

274
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,970
if you ever go to like a or watch a
documentary on those people like I,

275
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:47,650
I've seen those people.
If there was a planned parenthood,

276
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:51,340
I think it was in Boston and I remember
seeing these people outside of it and

277
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:51,740
they would,

278
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,480
when you would drive by and they would
hold up pictures of like dead babies and

279
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:59,230
stuff like hold up. Like they
harass women as they're going in.

280
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,910
They're like show them these pictures

281
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,390
when they come out and nobody is out there
and he noticed that everybody's gone.

282
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,030
Yeah. Why is that? I don't fucking know.

283
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,890
They probably know when the time when
the rebels was not there when I went, no,

284
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,670
they're not going to protest and they
don't give a fuck about those babies.

285
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,870
You don't have that.
You don't have that problem.

286
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,500
You just have a problem getting the Daddy.
They drop you off.

287
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,930
He cause he don't want to be a part of it.

288
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,610
Abortions. Tricky subject man. You know,

289
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,190
cause it's like at what point
in time should it be okay?

290
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,420
Like everybody can absolutely. I
was, I always say this is my pussy.

291
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:41,240
I'll do what I want. That's what I
say to her too. But nobody listens.

292
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,860
You believe me?
You can do whatever you want.

293
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:48,970
Who is Congress to tell you what
to do with yourself? Yeah. No, no,

294
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,040
no one can tell you. Yeah, because once
you have it in, you can't take care.

295
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,010
I two kids when I was 15 what
the fuck was you doing congress?

296
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,170
You had two kids by the time you
were 15 yes. That's crazy. Two kids.

297
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,330
Wow. I didn't have a fucking childhood.
That is incredible. That's incredible.

298
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,220
I don't know how I made it.
It was incredible.

299
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,770
Wow. Well you obviously
made it. You're okay.

300
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,723
You're funny.

301
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,370
Yeah, but I took a loan, went
through a lot of shit to get funny.

302
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,910
He's Christ wasn't funny
when I was having them. Yeah.

303
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,100
[inaudible] y'all were you
when you had your first kid?

304
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,200
I was 14 when I had my first kid
by a married man. Whoa. Hey boy.

305
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,040
I made him when I was 12 and he was 22.
Whoa.

306
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,360
So we started dating. I was in
elementary school. Oh my God.

307
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,830
12. I had a really nice
body. I was fuckable

308
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,440
fuckable today, Joe. But
I was fuckable back then.

309
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,820
When did you start fucking 12.
He was the first one.

310
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,830
He was the first one. You got a baby with
him and you had a baby when you're 40

311
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,950
team. Wow. Tuba ended. I got pregnant
again and gave birth when I was 15.

312
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,160
Goodness. Wow. That is a car.

313
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,230
You never met a teenage mom. Oh, I've met
teenage mom. Well, I'm a old teenager.

314
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,930
I used to be a teenage
mom. This, this, uh,

315
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,560
it's,
it's hard for someone who has children,

316
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,120
especially someone who has daughters.

317
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,130
I can hear the daughters too.
They didn't have any kids. They,

318
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,610
they didn't have the life not in place.

319
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,190
What do they feel like when they hear
your story? That's gotta be hard. I mean,

320
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,270
I guess you'd have to ask them,

321
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:31,330
but that has to be crazy to hear
that your mom went through that.

322
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,500
Well,
my daughter was dare you know,

323
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:38,360
she was dare cause I mean I got pregnant
and 14 and I had a brother then I

324
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:42,830
couldn't get a job. I started
selling drugs. So she was
there through everything.

325
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,570
I mean I think I'm her hero. Wow. So she,

326
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,910
after I got married and I
straighten everything out, you know,

327
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,530
she had a better life.
But

328
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,620
you know,

329
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,760
that's one of those situations where
people that have that attitude like that

330
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,770
everyone on welfare is just,
just lazy like that.

331
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:05,890
People don't need the help. They need to
pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

332
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:08,650
Like stories like that. Man,
you got to shut the fuck up.

333
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,050
Let me tell you something. When
you, when you dealing with you,

334
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,440
like I grew up in the ghetto, my mom
was on welfare, her mom was on welfare.

335
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,370
So people, I tell a story
about welfare is like diabetes.

336
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,620
If the mama get it as a good chance to
daughter might get it. So you teach is,

337
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,000
I mean she taught me how to do
this shit and I just said I didn't,

338
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,940
I don't want my daughter to
go through this bullshit.

339
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:32,780
I don't want my daughter to be a teenage
mom and you don't drop out of high

340
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:33,111
school.

341
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:36,720
My daughter's the first one to graduate
high school in three generations and the

342
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:41,420
first one to ever go to college and
my family. Wow. So I was determined.

343
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:43,820
You are not going to end
up like how he ended up.

344
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,400
That's beautiful.

345
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,900
That's amazing that that to me is
the greatest form of success ever.

346
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,270
If you can learn from your own mistakes,

347
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:55,990
important in part your life's wisdom on
your children and then your children go

348
00:19:55,991 --> 00:20:00,610
on to take the ball and carry it and run
it further and do what you just said.

349
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:02,080
Become the first person to go to college.

350
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,600
Become the first person to graduate
high school in many generations.

351
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,260
That's beautiful. That's a, that's
an amazing thing. Congratulations.

352
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,161
Well thank you.

353
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:13,090
I mean I worked hard for this shit
because I mean I didn't graduate my nobody

354
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:15,520
else. I had nobody to look up
to. I just know, I was like,

355
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:19,060
my daughter would not go through this
bullshit that I went through in life and I

356
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:23,500
had a son too, so he graduated
too. But wow. Nobody else.

357
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:26,170
I mean I had a niece to,
cause I had custody of my sister for kids.

358
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:28,330
So her oldest daughter graduate,

359
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:31,510
cause they are the same age right
after my daughter day. But nobody else,

360
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,840
everybody just keep having babies and
dropping out. It's so fucking, um,

361
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,640
what do you call it? An
epidemic. Yeah. We know.

362
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,470
It's just keep passing it down.

363
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,950
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it's um,
there's definitely kids,

364
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,420
everybody from their atmosphere.
That's why I always tell people,

365
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,620
if you can surround yourself with
people that are trying to get their shit

366
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:56,290
together and we'll help you get
your shit together because you,

367
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,720
you forced yourself to the standard
of the people that you're around.

368
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,510
If you're around a bunch of
people that are real friendly,

369
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,430
you're more likely to be friendly.
You know,

370
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:06,220
if you're around a bunch of people that
will go out of their way to help people,

371
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,410
you and my likely to go
on a way to help people.

372
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,350
And that's what I did. I
started to surround myself.
I said for me to do better,

373
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,260
I need somebody I can learn from him
because I didn't learn shit from my Mama.

374
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,220
My Mama stayed drunk all the time and
you know I was raised in a bootleg house

375
00:21:19,221 --> 00:21:22,610
so all I saw a drunk people
just bullshit all my life.

376
00:21:22,611 --> 00:21:26,300
So I started to pick my girlfriends.
If you didn't have a college degree,

377
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,710
a high school diploma,

378
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,740
you couldn't be my fucking friend cause
I have a bunch of stupid ass relatives.

379
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,880
He did somebody I can learn,
you know,

380
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,110
this is what put a
correct sentence together,

381
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,860
all that bullshit cause I was dropped
out of school in eighth grade so I needed

382
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:41,540
to surround myself around better people.

383
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:46,370
So all my girlfriends got college degrees
and you know they, they married, they,

384
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,040
you know that's amazing though
that you figured that out. Like,

385
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:53,240
how old were you when you decided to have
these, like really high standards? Um,

386
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,180
probably about 17 cause probably about
17 is when the thing was winding down

387
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:03,200
from being in a bad relationship with my
kids' father because I, you know, I, I,

388
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,300
I started dating him and I,
I think what I was looking for,

389
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:09,140
but just somebody to love me because
I didn't have a fucking father.

390
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,230
So I think I was just saying
I need somebody to love me.

391
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:16,280
So I get involved with these guys
become very abusive. Who shoots me,

392
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,760
who beats me. And then I'm thinking,
you know, cause I was taught these,

393
00:22:19,761 --> 00:22:23,900
my Mama said, if a man don't hit you,
he don't love you. She said, fuck out.

394
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:26,810
And he hit me with a rollerskate
one night watch. A funny,

395
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,010
this is like the worst advice I've ever
let alone gave me a lot of fucked up

396
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:33,450
advice that I realize now
that was fucked up advice,

397
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,890
but it was passed down to her. So she
was like, if a man, no, he hit you.

398
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:37,724
He don't love you.

399
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,080
So like my baby daddy hit me with a
rollerskate run night cause it's food.

400
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:46,150
Love the roller skate and that fucking
skate shook my skull and I say to myself

401
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:47,890
at this love bitch I can do without.

402
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,980
I bought up my fist and I knocked that
motherfucker in the back seat and I

403
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:55,900
started to fight back from that
day on roller skates. He hit me,

404
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,730
he shot me in the back of the head.
He hit me with a bunch of shit.

405
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,800
Shoot you with a 38 Jesus Christ.
Where did it hit you? And it just,

406
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:07,580
it cracked the back of my skull.
That's it. Just grazed. You know,

407
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:11,210
I went in a little bit but it was fucked
up cause they, they was, they was like,

408
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:14,270
I can't believe you're not dead.
So I was in the hospital,

409
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:18,080
I get better and I call him. It's
like, Oh you love me. Come get me.

410
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,470
That's how fucking stores are
in jail. You didn't call it? No,

411
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:24,010
I wouldn't tell I was in
love because my Mama said,

412
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,700
oh because I'll slap you a couple
of times. You don't shoot you.

413
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:33,140
Oh my God. That's real fucking love.
Jesus Christ. He was trying to kill you.

414
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,060
Well he say he wasn't.

415
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,110
You know how fucking good at and you
have to be to shoot to have it in their

416
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:43,220
head and I was 15 oh my God.

417
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,900
He shot you in the head
when you were 15 holy shit.

418
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,480
Don't going to get shot again

Who Shot you in the breast? A fucking
fool. Little drive by Blue Minneopa off.

420
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,330
Oh my God.
Where were you sitting when this happened?

421
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,450
No, we was arguing was
that we had an argument,

422
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:05,480

I was a drug dealer. I was like,

423
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:09,020

shoot you, but I'm just 15 with a gun.

424
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,810
I didn't know you wasn't supposed to
pull a gun unless you're going to shoot a

425
00:24:11,811 --> 00:24:16,310
motherfucker. So he come back
with a 45 and started fucking
pop, pop, pop, pop out.

426
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,880
So I started running and one
of the 45 is hit me up on it,

427
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:22,870
the arm and blew my whole
fucking titty apart. My God,

428
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,940

a lot fee.

00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:38,830
she was like the police like

433
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,750

I didn't really want to tell cause I was

434
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:44,510

My daughter yelled at, well, monk,

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,000
And that you're 15 and how old is your
daughter then? She was too. Yeah. Wow.

439
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,550
Yeah, she's two. She doesn't know
what the fuck she's talking about.

440
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,270
She's trying to,

441
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:07,090
everything she knew every fucking
thing she's still remember to this day,

442
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,760
God is an insane environment to grow up.

443
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:13,960
And your mom's a 15 year old drug
dealer who got shot in the titty. Yeah.

444
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,760
And a drive by.
Yeah.

445
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,620
And you saw my with dope and
money like crazy every day.

446
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,160
How did you get, did you get arrested?
Fuck yeah, you always get arrested.

447
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,650
Oh was always, let's know. Beating it.

448
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,910
They wait till you earn enough money so
they can take it. Is that what happened?

449
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,100
Yeah,
I did a year in prison for it.

450
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,560
That was the worst day of my life cause
I miss my daughter going to kindergarten

451
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:40,630
and you can't get that shit back. But
I was just trying to survive. Honestly.

452
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:42,970
I was just trying to survive.
Well I couldn't imagine

453
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:47,050
how anybody would function just
being 14 having to fend for yourself,

454
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:48,460
having kids like what?
You can't

455
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,490
anybody because I was 15
and I needed a work permit.

456
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,630
So a lot of times I would just show up
on the fucking interview and it was like,

457
00:25:56,631 --> 00:25:59,990
where your work put me? And
I was like, Meat Ashland,
Nakheel I need a fucking job.

458
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:04,010
I got two kids. They like, you're supposed
to be in school. That's here in our day.

459
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:06,830
I got two fucking kids defend for.
So at that time,

460
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,710
crack had just hit the
black community really hard.

461
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,600
So I started to sell crack because
everybody was getting on it. Wow.

462
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,130
Did you take it? I never did drugs.
I grew up watching my momma, um,

463
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,180
as an alcoholic, so everything my
Mama did. I said I wouldn't do,

464
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,230
she smoked cigarettes. She drank,
she did whatever. I was like,

465
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,170
I'm not going to end up like you
motherfuckers. I think y'all stole me.

466
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,890
Well, you were the the end of the
line, you know, I mean that's the,

467
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,440
that's what it looks like.
I mean,

468
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,610
it looks like you're the one who
figured it out and then you're in.

469
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:44,130
Pardon that onto your kids.
But the end of the line,

470
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,360
like sometimes enough is enough and
your own genetics were like, stop,

471
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,720
cut the bullshit.
Let's reset this whole thing.

472
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,820
Yeah. Cause you, especially
when I had kids, I was laughing.

473
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,570
My keys can't grow up around this Bush.
I just started doing stand up. Um,

474
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:03,720
I went to the welfare office to get my
food stamps and welfare recertified.

475
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,960
So you like it a white caseworker and I
tell her, oh, I had such a whole life,

476
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:12,050
I've been shot, I've been this, I've been
there and you know, white case worker,

477
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,760
once I tell these stories in the detail,
white women, they still easy to make cry.

478
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,290
So this bitch and give me a few extra to
bumps and tell me what was going on for

479
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:25,000
free. So one day I go in and I got
this black caseworker. So I said, aw,

480
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,750
this bitch is going to be hard cause
you know you'd think all black people is

481
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,593
from the ghetto.

482
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:33,580
So I started telling her these stories
and this bitch busts out laughing and I

483
00:27:33,581 --> 00:27:35,260
was like, what the fuck are
you laughing? And she was like,

484
00:27:35,261 --> 00:27:37,120
you should be a comedian.
This shit is hilarious.

485
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:40,150
You ever heard of Richard Pryor
are Richard Pryor store? I like,

486
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,000
I didn't come up fucking
job. I came for free. Shit.

487
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,330
That's hilarious.
You didn't want a job?

488
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,230
No,
I was on welfare.

489
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:52,220
I mean at the time I was trying to get
my life back together. So, um, you know,

490
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,060
I'm just home had us free free house
cause they had section eight custody of my

491
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:57,110
sister for kids.

492
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,520
So I had a total of six kids and a
husband who was working and I was like,

493
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,690
you know,
just how I grew up,

494
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:04,850
motherfucker stand at home watching
the young and the restless.

495
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,430
So you didn't even start to think about
doing stand up until this lady brought

496
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:10,080
that up.

497
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,790
Well she, the first one it kind
of put it in my ear. Yeah. Wow.

498
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:18,060
I never thought this shit was funny.
It was pain. See what I mean? You know,

499
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,600
I mean when you tell, when I tell
these stories, I had to get over them.

500
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,780
So you got forgive, yield and
then you got gotta, you know,

501
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:29,100
you got to let everything go so it
doesn't bother you to tell it on stage.

502
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,480
I can laugh about it now. You know,
people look at me having a, you know,

503
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:34,830
sleeping with a married man.

504
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,970
I'm 12 and he's 22 that's
fucking child molestation.

505
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:43,200
But how do you deal with it? So
I deal with it, I laugh about it.

506
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,250
I'm turning all that we'll use and I used
to be pissed off at this dude because

507
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:50,220
he took my fucking childhood.
I mean, think about it.

508
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:52,710
I was a mom at 14 that's crazy.

509
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,710
I got a 16 year old daughter that all
she do is fucking play with the IPAD.

510
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,990
Just doing what a 16 year old supposed
to do. I never had that opportunity.

511
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,480
I never had an opportunity
to build a girl.

512
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,420
It's overrated because if it was awesome

513
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,950
in every song,
I wish I was seven again.

514
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,920
I was retarded when I was seven I'd be
playing with mutant Ninja Turtles and

515
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:17,750
pretended, pretended helicopters are
real plastic helicopters. That's stupid.

516
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,250
That's stupid shit.
I'm glad.

517
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,200
Well
no you're not.

518
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,160
You don't want to,
I steal your daughter's child.

519
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,530
It could be drop kicking
the shit out that old Nigga.

520
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,970
You Ain't get no pussy,
mother. Fuck this cat. Is

521
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,830
it about a guy that would want to do that?
That's what's fucked up.

522
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,870
When you were talking
about like the whole,

523
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,630
you know your family falls into a pattern.
I bet they're in.

524
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,460
I learned cause I'm writing a one
woman show for my, for my life.

525
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,660
And I learned that my daddy
got my mama young like that.

526
00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:00,010
My Mama had six kids by
the time she was 22 wow.

527
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,660
So it's just passing it down.

528
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,090
Yeah. It's so common that that
happens on both sides. You know.

529
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,530
I mean maybe,

530
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,360
maybe your husband or the man who
gave a got you pregnant maybe like

531
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,230
in his fucking husband, man, the dude,

532
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,960
whatever he was at the time.

533
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:20,690
He was never your husband and ain't
the point in time he was married.

534
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,570
Oh that's fine.
Well whoever he is,

535
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,870
it got Facebook friends.
Huh? Nevermind. I bet

536
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,870
you know, in his life. I bet that
was probably common to, you know,

537
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,810
I bet that kind of fucked
up behavior was normal.

538
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,280
Well yeah.
Yeah.

539
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,070
Cause I mean if you look at it
as child molestation for sure,

540
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,630
to me he's a fucking molester. You know,
we learned later on he did other shit.

541
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,910
But I mean to,

542
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,360
to fuck a 12 year old and you're 22 and
to show up at the hospital and signed

543
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:54,110
both kids birth certificate. Nobody
questioned your old ass. That's crazy.

544
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,720
That is the most gross
shit out of all of this.

545
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:01,750
I can not look at my kid's
birth certificate because
on there I'm 14 and he's 22

546
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,110
and my daughter went to get her birth
certificate because she was going on a

547
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:09,770
cruise and she was like, oh
my God, look, this is nasty.

548
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:13,310
I was like this put that away. I didn't
say bitch, but I was like put the shot.

549
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,210
Wow. Yeah, it's a sickness.
It has to be this. It's,

550
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:24,310
and it's a sickness of the mind
and apparently when someone,

551
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:25,480
when it gets done to them,

552
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:27,490
it's more likely that they're
going to do it to somebody else.

553
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,700
Yeah. And you know, he never thought he
did anything wrong cause I asked him,

554
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,830
I was like, you know, I'm,
I'm in my forties now.

555
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,170
You actually took my
childhood and he was like,

556
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:39,550
your mind and body wasn't 12 oh,
what the fuck are you talking about?

557
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:40,241
My mind and body,

558
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:43,980
because I had a big booty that was
round and my TV set up like apples. Oh,

559
00:31:43,981 --> 00:31:46,060
I had to come fuck me,
sign on my forehead.

560
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,090
Well that's his way of
excusing his behavior.

561
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:53,420
He got horny when he was around you,
so he felt like your body and mind.

562
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,430
But you know, when you
describe it, see how was uh,

563
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:00,680
a man supposed to decipher that if
he's a dumb dude at 22, you know,

564
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,370
he's not going to decipher that.
No, he just wants to fuck. Yeah,

565
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,850
that's the problem.
And it's such an overwhelming urge.

566
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,250
Unless you have someone around
you constantly and partying,

567
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:14,390
morals and ethics and grow on you the
right way. We grow up like animals.

568
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,750
We have instincts, you know, there's
animal instincts, horny instincts.

569
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,590
They overcome any idea
of guilt or remorse or,

570
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,740
and so that's his way of
rational rationalizing it.

571
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,590
I get a body and mind weren't 14

572
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:31,070
well my body truly, it was a
four time. It's fine. It's fun

573
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,330
excusing

574
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:40,070
him. But I'm assuming he was a
dumb dude. Right? He's dumb as

575
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,840
fuck.
He work at Jiffy lubes now.

576
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,030
Nothing wrong with people working at
Jiffy Lube, but I hear you. It's just,

577
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,240
it's, it's hard to get your
shit together, you know,

578
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:52,520
but you getting your shit
together and your situation,

579
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,620
that's more impressive than anybody,

580
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:58,490
any normal person in any other situation
because your situation sounds so

581
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:01,910
fucking crazy that for you
to go full circle from that,

582
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:06,530
to be in a working professional comedian
paying taxes and yeah, the whole deal.

583
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,080
And on top of that,
the most important thing,

584
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:11,870
seeing your kids grow up in
a completely different way.

585
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,340
That's all my kids all the time. You
don't know how fucking good you have it.

586
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,420
Especially my second, my second,
my to buy my husband, you know,

587
00:33:19,421 --> 00:33:22,660
we live in the suburbs and they don't
know. She didn't hear a gun fire.

588
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:27,580
I never had to put drugs in a pampers and
how to dope and sell drugs in front of

589
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:30,880
their schools. I never had to do none
of that shit to them. So I was like,

590
00:33:30,881 --> 00:33:32,260
you don't know how to fucking get it.
You got it.

591
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,630
Yeah. A lot of people don't, you
know, that's what the old expression,

592
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,830
you know that um,

593
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,370
or the old thought rather than one day
there's gonna come a point in time when

594
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:44,700
the apocalypse comes and then
civilization is going to crumble.

595
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,610
The apocalypse is already here.
It's just not in your neighborhood.

596
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,570
Like there's spots in the world where you
can go to right now where you might as

597
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:55,680
well be in Mad Max. Right. There's, how
about Liberia? You hear this shit man,

598
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:59,190
they're fucking closing the borders of
Liberia cause he bolas breaking out and

599
00:33:59,191 --> 00:34:01,320
people had it.
They escaped from the hospital.

600
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:05,070
He's fucking people escape
from quarantine. Jesus Christ.

601
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:08,100
They don't know where they're going.
It's a city of a million people

602
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,020
was it or somebody here in Los Angeles
that just escaped from the hospital also

603
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:14,360
with some kind of really contagious
disease and they were like,

604
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:16,460
he has a warrant for his arrest
right now because he just left. If

605
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,570
the hospital did he
take the career went on.

606
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,000
That was that movie,
that strain.

607
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:24,670
I think you were probably stoned
and you were watching the strain,

608
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,970
that TV show bag with my an FX
show. Have you seen the strain? No,

609
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,070
it's good fucking show, man. I
read the book and I didn't like it.

610
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,900
I liked it for three quarters of the way,

611
00:34:34,901 --> 00:34:38,740
but the last quarter was kind of whack
and I decided that that's not enough.

612
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,130
You know, three quarters really good
and then one quarter of the book sucks.

613
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:47,440
I can't recommend it, but as a show it's
awesome. It's really cool. That's just,

614
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,420
I think that's what they
were meant they meant to do.

615
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,860
When they made the strain
in the first place,

616
00:34:50,861 --> 00:34:54,580
they meant to make it as a a a mini
series and they wrote it as a book,

617
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:59,590
but that that's how it takes place.
It takes place at a a disease.

618
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:04,330
There's a quarantine and these people
get out and then everyone's fucked.

619
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,300
I don't know if you're talking about
just talking about like the ghetto to me,

620
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:13,420
but I'm just going to listen to,
you were talking about the apocalypse.

621
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,240
I'm talking about terrible situate,
like if your life,

622
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,360
like when you were getting shot
in the tit and you were 15,

623
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:21,910
you had your baby with you and
you draw a drug deal and all that.

624
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,740
If you forced some white woman in
her forties into that situation,

625
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:31,540
she would be in, that would
be the apocalypse. That'll
be the apocalypse for her.

626
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,880
I have to sell crack. What? Someone shot
my ted off. Why I can't do this. You know?

627
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,130
I mean,
that would

628
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,580
be just like the apocalypse. There'd
be no different. I found it. It's,

629
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,690
it was actually in north Hollywood.
It was a guy with tuberculosis.

630
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,460
Uh, tuberculosis. Is
that super contagious?

631
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,470
If it gets bad, I think it's something
that like if you start sneezing there,

632
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,430
yeah.

633
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:59,690
Yeah. But I think they
arrested him. Oh, okay. Yeah.

634
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:03,260
But they could treat tuberculosis.
Right. That's not scaring me. Like Ebola,

635
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,360
Ebola is a hemorrhagic virus,

636
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:10,310
which means you believe you bleed
everywhere. Like you boot your eyeballs,

637
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:12,890
bleed your fucking skin falls apart.

638
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,640
Like Ebola is rough business.
That's no joke.

639
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:21,560
Those hemorrhagic viruses, when I did
that, a Scifi show, uh, questions,

640
00:36:21,561 --> 00:36:22,760
everything. The, um,

641
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,950
the real issue with that was like
scary on that show was talking about

642
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:30,530
infectious diseases and they
were talking about, um, you know,

643
00:36:30,531 --> 00:36:33,650
everybody's worried that like there'll
be some terrorists and then released some

644
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,870
anthrax and everybody get
fucked. They're like, listen,

645
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,510
what nature makes the stuff that nature's
making that is way scarier than any

646
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:45,020
fucking shit that anybody's
cooking up in a lab.

647
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,700
Because at any given point in time,

648
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:51,850
nature can make some insane virus that
no one can fix at any point in time.

649
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:57,320
These two viruses can interact with each
other and create some mutant and it can,

650
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:00,830
they're constantly changing and growing
and they're constantly avoiding the

651
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:04,970
attack by antibiotics and antiviral drugs.

652
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,960
So they're strengthening and getting
stronger and, and finding new,

653
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:12,780
trickier ways to get into people's
bodies. You scare me. Can we stop?

654
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,510
This guy's scared the fuck out of me.
He's scared the fuck out of me.

655
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:20,870
He's one of these dudes was a Russian cat
who told me that when the Cold War was

656
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:21,470
going on,

657
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:26,120
they had trenches filled
with anthrax trenches.

658
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,550
And I go, well, how many people
would that kill? He said,

659
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,270
every person on the planet,
every single person. I said,

660
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:34,970
there's enough anthrax to kill
every person that he goes,

661
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,100
absolutely no question about it.

662
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,470
There's enough anthrax that they had
that could kill everybody. I look like,

663
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,210
what are you talking about?
How much anthrax is there?

664
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,520
Like don't we take like
a little bit to kill you?

665
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:51,020
Like anthrax is a motherfucker and this
idea was that they were going to figure

666
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:55,100
out some sort of an airborne dispersion
method and even the government even

667
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:58,970
tested like there was something, I think
it was in Cleveland, I forget the city,

668
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,850
but they sprayed some shit over this city.

669
00:38:01,851 --> 00:38:04,430
Like phosphorescent like
something that they could track.

670
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,700
They like essentially what the chem
trail people think is going on.

671
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:10,550
You know like they actually did it and
they did it from the top of a building.

672
00:38:10,551 --> 00:38:13,310
They sprayed it or something like that
because they were trying to figure out

673
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:16,040
how much of a containment a period,

674
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,940
how much of an area would they have to
contain, you know, if a disease got out.

675
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,840
That's what,
how goofy people are there.

676
00:38:22,841 --> 00:38:27,841
We're thinking about like actually just
it's so indiscriminately just letting a

677
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,860
disease go out. Uh, does
dizzy like that was an option.

678
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:34,340
I get disease that would kill the
entire pie. Not just the soldiers,

679
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,230
not the people that were in,

680
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,160
you know, the politicians who are
causing the war in the first place. No,

681
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,530
the entire population with a virus,

682
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,320
a virus and make your
fucking eyeballs bleed out.

683
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,430
I think you just scared the shit out
of us should, we shouldn't be scared.

684
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,820
I think we should be scared.
You know why I think we should be scared?

685
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:55,480
Because look, if the world was just us,
we would work everything out, you know?

686
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,520
Yeah. I couldn't imagine
going to war with you, Ms Pat.

687
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:01,330
You seem like a very nice person.
I don't think I can whoop you,

688
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,920
but I don't know what I mean it like
that. I mean, you know what I'm saying?

689
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,540
If there was some,

690
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,590
if you had a country that you own
and I had a country that I don't,

691
00:39:06,591 --> 00:39:09,610
I think we've come to some reasonable
terms. I don't think it would be an issue.

692
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,420
But when you see shit like what's going
on in Israel today, you see these,

693
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,130
you know Israel's got, they've got all
their military troops there and there.

694
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,650
Everyone's launching rockets
and it's just horrifying man.

695
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:23,890
You see in babies that are dead
on the beach, these photos,

696
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:28,570
Anthony Bordain tweeted some photo the
other day. It was horrifying. Like why,

697
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:32,620
if that can happen over there,
that can happen right fucking here.

698
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:37,000
I mean it's contained while it's over
there and our idea is that, well,

699
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,340
if it's out of there,
if it's out of our mind,

700
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:44,290
but that shit's going on right now in
2014 and it could just as easily happen in

701
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:48,010
New York or in Pittsburgh or anywhere,
anywhere.

702
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,890
Just pick a city London.
That can happen in London.

703
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:53,680
Crazy shit can go down like that.
Any part of the world.

704
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,000
If you've got enough people that disagree
and they're highly armed and they have

705
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:02,350
religious ideas attached to what they're
doing, you got a terrifying situation.

706
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:06,340
That's how we're living right
now in 2000 and fucking 14

707
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:10,290
I saw the worst video over the
weekend on Facebook. For some reason,

708
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:13,410
Facebook has the worst videos now
people are posting on their lines,

709
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,550
but one is this,

710
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:19,320
a Israeli family that captured it at a
child from Palestine and this kid was

711
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:23,910
probably like five or six and they're
teaching their daughter who is a Jewish I

712
00:40:23,911 --> 00:40:25,930
guess,
or wetter Israelian uh,

713
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:30,780
to beat the kid with a s a bat.
And so the kids that cry like,

714
00:40:30,781 --> 00:40:31,780
please stop,
you know,

715
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:35,160
this look five-year-old and this little
six year olds hitting it with a bat and

716
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:37,440
she wouldn't, she didn't want
to hit it hard, you know,

717
00:40:37,441 --> 00:40:38,580
so she's just barely hitting it.

718
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:40,370
And this other kid that's a
little older comes up. No,

719
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,020
because there's no hate him and just like
starts punching this little kid in the

720
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:45,310
face because the kids Palestinian,
yeah,

721
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,450
they'd like captured somebody and
they're just beating this kid up like the

722
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:49,380
whole family like that.

723
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:53,820
Everyone.
Can we go back to the ghetto better?

724
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,800
Eddie Bravo and we watched
that movie once. Um, uh,

725
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,020
what does that fucking movie
is a Brazilian movie about the,

726
00:41:03,021 --> 00:41:07,580
the ghetto o children of God, city
of God, city of got City of God.

727
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,510
It's so fucking crazy movie ever
seen it? No. God Damn is pat.

728
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:15,020
You got to see city of God. It's
incredible. It's really, really,

729
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:16,130
really fucking good.

730
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:21,580
But it's all about the favelas of Brazil
and how the violence there is just on a

731
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,120
completely different level. First of
all, these houses are essentially like,

732
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,360
a lot of them are almost like they're
camping out. Like they don't have windows,

733
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,090
they don't have running water, they have
dirt floors and some of them, you know,

734
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:34,430
they'd like some them,
they can range

735
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,090
in, you know, like ghetto
to it. Incredibly poor.

736
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:42,050
Like essentially you live in the woods
and he'd just have like a shelter around.

737
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,790
It's not much different than that.

738
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,120
And these young kid drug dealers just
unbelievably violent and ruthless.

739
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:53,660
The whole movies just like so more people
die in the first five minutes of that

740
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:58,280
movie. Then the entire Boyz in the
hood. Dang. Yeah. Like quickly,

741
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,400
like more people die. Maybe in
the first five minutes. It's a Wa,

742
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:06,310
but it's a good fucking movie to end.
It's based on a real scenario of you.

743
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,050
You go to the ghettos of Brazil,

744
00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:11,750
like some of the worst poor neighborhoods
where there's a lot of drug violence.

745
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:15,230
That was what they were scared of when
they came to the World Cup. You know,

746
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:19,520
it's really some horrifying shit QB going
down there that's happening right now.

747
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,790
So there's always somebody that's got
worse. That's how fucked up people I,

748
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,940
this is just a huge range of
what we're capable of, you know?

749
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:33,230
So when people see fucked up shit that's
going on in the news and they try to

750
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:36,100
pretend it's not happening
right now because it's on
the other side of the world,

751
00:42:36,101 --> 00:42:40,640
it's like, yeah, well if, if it's
possible right now somewhere,

752
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,380
it's possible here,
you know,

753
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,340
it just a bunch of things we'd have to
go wrong and it could be just as possible

754
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:48,260
here.
Well let's hope it don't make it here.

755
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,250
We just kind of figured out a way to
get better people to lead the world.

756
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,470
It's that simple.
It's really that simple.

757
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,780
That is the 100% solution for all of it.
Yeah,

758
00:42:56,781 --> 00:42:58,610
there's a lot of problems financially.

759
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:01,730
There's a lot of problems in this world
as far as politically the different

760
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:05,660
sides, like, like the, the
argument like you know, I'm not a,

761
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:08,900
I'm not a a republican by any
stretch of the imagination,

762
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,660
but I believe in some things
that they think make sense.

763
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:15,430
I'm a big Democrat, but I do believe
in a lot of stuff that they say.

764
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,040
Yeah, well I think the
Democrats, what I like socially,

765
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,840
the attitude of the Democrats better.

766
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,680
I think it's a more progressive attitude
as far as caring for people and looking

767
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:29,130
after people. And sometimes people point
down at that and they said, you know, the,

768
00:43:29,131 --> 00:43:33,500
the accused people of facilitating the
welfare state and they have all these

769
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:37,940
goofy ideas about like what it is that
keeps someone in a bad situation like

770
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:41,600
that. That's the number one problem
that I have with right wing people.

771
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,970
This pull them up by their
bootstraps mentality.

772
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:46,880
Cause I'll meet someone like you
and I go, what? Fucking bootstraps.

773
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,760
She's fucking 14 years
old and she's got a baby.

774
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:54,350
You telling me to call another one when
you're 15 you're telling me that she

775
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:57,950
should be pulling herself up by our
bootstraps. That's fucking crazy.

776
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,660
I don't know other than what
you did though, other than
what you did personally,

777
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,260
where you just realize that a fucking
enough is enough. You worked hard.

778
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:10,130
You got yourself out of that situation.
How else you're, you've been through it.

779
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,080
If you had an engineer,

780
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:16,360
the way our society fixes this
problem that we have with extremely

781
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:21,490
me, I had to, somebody had to make
me realize that that was a problem,

782
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:25,570
which when I got married, I met him
when I met my husband. He's like,

783
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,460
people don't live like this.
And I was like,

784
00:44:27,461 --> 00:44:29,860
what do you mean people don't
live like this? He's like,

785
00:44:29,861 --> 00:44:32,640
people go out and get a job.
People don't take from other people.

786
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:37,140
People don't sell drugs. So I had
to be taught that from my husband.

787
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,700
That's crazy. You know? And I'm I,

788
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:42,990
here I am one 19 I think at the time and
I had to go get a job. How do you go?

789
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:47,550
How do you go into society and get a
fucking minimal ways job when you used to

790
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,670
making $10,000 a day,
as you know,

791
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,650
when you said 16 and 17 years
old, $10,000 a day. Yes.

792
00:44:55,651 --> 00:45:00,450
I had a fucking trap out of this world.
I mean I don't want to call a trap.

793
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:04,050
I don't know what they call it now
because I've been gone from the ghetto too

794
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:06,900
long.
But back then it was called a trap.

795
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,530
So when you saw on drugs like
your neighborhood a trap. Yeah,

796
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,320
you stand on the corner. That's your
trap. If that's what you start doing,

797
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,030
the correct gays or the junkies it calm,

798
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:19,470
then that's where they came and everybody
knew rabbit was on fast street. Oh

799
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,410
rabbit was on fast street.
That's our trap. Thirst trap.

800
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,030
We need to start calling
our shows traps. Call. Yeah,

801
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:29,160
we're going to do a trap this
weekend at the Ice House.

802
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,850
It's love that term.

803
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,520
They'll use that term anymore cause I
don't know what you do to sell drugs

804
00:45:36,521 --> 00:45:39,760
anymore. If they didn't use it on the
wire. People haven't heard it? No,

805
00:45:39,761 --> 00:45:43,750
that was desperate because it was, I think
the wire was a little after I started,

806
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:46,510
so it was probably written by white
people too. But you know what,

807
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:50,530
this show fucking husband love this
show. And I was like, he was like,

808
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:54,040
you got to see this show and when I saw
so I don't want to see that fucking shit.

809
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:57,310
I don't want to relive that crap.
And I got in tonight, you know,

810
00:45:57,311 --> 00:46:00,700
watching the whole fucking, I'll love
it. And he was like, how real is it?

811
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,820
Because my husband comes from a background
where Momma go to church every day

812
00:46:03,821 --> 00:46:06,610
and daddy go to work every day.
And it was 16 old them,

813
00:46:06,611 --> 00:46:11,140
but they wasn't on welfare and daddy and
Momma provided for them where I didn't

814
00:46:11,141 --> 00:46:14,540
have that life, you know, you know
his Mama didn't play that shit.

815
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,530
Want to sell in Joel's, you wouldn't run
in the street. You was going to school.

816
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,990
Wow. So, you know,

817
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,980
so did he, like when he, when he met
you and you said nobody lives like this,

818
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,130
did he offer suggestions or do you just
take you by the hand? Listen Bitch,

819
00:46:27,131 --> 00:46:28,090
we're gonna straighten this shit out.

820
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:34,300
No, pretty much he was
just like, you know, he,

821
00:46:34,301 --> 00:46:37,920
I think he was, he was attracted because
I was a goal getter cause I was, I was,

822
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,170
I was coming out of selling drugs cause
people had is do you know the crack

823
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:46,010
epidemic has slowed down. So Nana new
thing was forging checks. So I was,

824
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,340
I was into that shit really
heavy and he was like,

825
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:54,460
you hurting these people all over the
fucking know these people I know is bank

826
00:46:54,461 --> 00:46:56,980
of America and the check number
is high, you know, and he's like,

827
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:01,210
you can't do this shit. And he just talked
to me and, and not, and I will listen.

828
00:47:01,211 --> 00:47:05,410
I remember I had a lot of drugs
one day and um, he was like,

829
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:08,530
I like you and I want to date you.
He said,

830
00:47:08,531 --> 00:47:12,910
but I can't take you home to my mom as
a drug dealer. And your name is rabbit.

831
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,590
So I'm thinking this is the opportunity
for my kids to have a daddy.

832
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,550
And he got all his back teeth,
eddy curry and his shoes clean.

833
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:29,110
Any little punch a bitch in the eye
every Friday gingy I had to have.

834
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,250
That's hilarious. Wow.
So I, I went for it.

835
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,150
So I gave my niece who I taught
how to sell drugs, all of my drugs.

836
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:44,800
She, did she work for you or did
you see where the business was?

837
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:46,390
She was young when I got her,

838
00:47:46,391 --> 00:47:50,680
she was like maybe 10 and they were haul
the drugs for me over the years. So I,

839
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,450
you know, I've taught her how to
do it and she became a drug dealer.

840
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,960
When did she start selling drugs for you?
Shit,

841
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:59,080
they was probably 11 oh my God.

842
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,660
It was horrible. We was all fucking
keys cause they mom was on crack.

843
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,420
This is my,
this is my baby daddy's sister.

844
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:11,900
Their mom was on crack so I
took them in. Here I am, she,

845
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:16,740
I think they're 11 and I'm fucking 15
they think and I'm grown, ain't grown up.

846
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,370
So now I got my two kids and
her three kids and we live in,

847
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:24,390
I'm taking everybody to school cause
I sold drugs in front of my daughter,

848
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,430
my daughter's school.
So she's fucking crazy.

849
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,740
This will be for the no school,
no drug school zone signs went up.

850
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:35,680
So I was already grandfathered
in when that shit got there.

851
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,170
That's a really serious federal federal
offense. Right? If you sell drugs.

852
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,120
Yeah. Yeah. But I was already getting
them. Science wasn't up making those days.

853
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:48,100
So I will drop everybody off at school
and everybody knew when they got out they

854
00:48:48,101 --> 00:48:49,480
knew what to do with the drugs.

855
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:53,490
That's right. Wow, that is crazy. So
you just had a whole system going.

856
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,050
I had a whole little system going.

857
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:58,920
So when you decided you meet your husband
and you say, you know, what are I?

858
00:48:58,921 --> 00:49:01,350
This dude's great, um, I'm
going to listen to him.

859
00:49:01,351 --> 00:49:04,230
I'm going to do whatever I have to do
to keep this work and I'll just have her

860
00:49:04,231 --> 00:49:07,210
take care of this. Does she, are
you telling him what to do? She

861
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,220
pulling or you can give her the best.
I just give it.

862
00:49:09,221 --> 00:49:11,440
So I say you can have the
whole trap I'm going to get,

863
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,940
I'm going to give this do to change.

864
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:16,150
And it was weird because
I had no more money.

865
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:20,530
I couldn't ride around and my flashy
care lack anymore. The Cadillac. Yeah,

866
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:23,590
because I had a learner's license and
would Alana's like, she didn't need a,

867
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:28,990
you need a uh, licensed drivers. So
I will have a crack here for a day.

868
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,840
Different crackers. Hey, you got a
driver's license? Get in the car.

869
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,210
I'm a supply you a car, you know, crack
every hour. I just need the police pulled.

870
00:49:36,211 --> 00:49:39,400
Little pull out your fucking license
so I can drive with my learners. Lice.

871
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:43,930
Holy Shit. That's how I learned how to
drive a crackhead. Taught me how to drive.

872
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:45,940
That is crazy.

873
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,420
So you drive and crackheads around
just so that you could drive, they,

874
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:54,450
that enabled you to do your business.
Yes. To drop off dope pickup. Do it.

875
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,160
Think the crackheads would go,
this chick is fucking 50

876
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,880
and she's got this crazy,
they was giving me get my shit together.

877
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,980
They was scared of me.

878
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,850
How did you have your shit together like
that at 15 just necessity. Lab assist.

879
00:50:07,851 --> 00:50:09,940
Necessity. You know what, my
husband told me, he seen it.

880
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:14,290
It has a lot to do with my grand daddy.
My granddaddy used to sell a book.

881
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:18,940
He was a bootleg looker, looker
bootleg house or whatever you call it.

882
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,590
So he said, I never saw anybody
working my family, everybody hustle.

883
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:28,130
So I guess I got those skills from him.
And it makes, if you grow up seeing

884
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,110
something like that, and I think
that's how people are supposed to live.

885
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,190
Everybody thought I was grown jail.

886
00:50:32,191 --> 00:50:37,191
Nobody knew I was fucking 50 I mean I
had two kids and other kids selling drugs

887
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:42,120
for me and everybody was like, yes ma'am,
no ma'am. And one day they was like,

888
00:50:42,121 --> 00:50:43,800
how old are you?
And I said,

889
00:50:43,801 --> 00:50:48,801
it's six days like you fucking 16 I had
like eight cars or learner's license in

890
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:54,950
dry fleet. A crack weight. Yes. They
were like, hey baby. Hey Rabbit,

891
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,970
you want me to drive for you today?
You want to ride in the car?

892
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,970
And I would just apply them rocks and
they smoked the rock while I'm riding

893
00:50:59,971 --> 00:51:03,900
around with run DMC and
whoever was out at a time,

894
00:51:03,901 --> 00:51:06,600
you know invo pumping my music.
Are they smoking crack?

895
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:08,810
Because I needed a licensed
driver in the car. Wow.

896
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:14,740
Yeah. It so crazy that no. How
old were you when you got popped?

897
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,480
Um, you know what? I had a police
officer. I was a beer is he said, he said,

898
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,910
I know you selling Craig Bitch,
he's said,

899
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:25,690
but I'm not going to lock you up
until you 17 cause when it's cracked,

900
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:27,250
first hit the black community,

901
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:31,450
everybody went to jail at 18 and you
went to juvenile is 17 but people just go

902
00:51:31,451 --> 00:51:31,740
down there,

903
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:35,230
yo your kids get caught with a fucking
half a kilo of cocaine and you can get

904
00:51:35,231 --> 00:51:37,870
them right out of juvenile cause they
didn't really know how to handle the

905
00:51:37,871 --> 00:51:38,704
situation.

906
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:43,720
So they changed the age from 18 or 17
yo has go to jellies 17 in Georgia.

907
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,580
So I had a birthday April the second
Neff fucker had me in jail April to feel,

908
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,010
to seek some shit like that.

909
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,160
I had a cousin that in the
morning everybody went to school,

910
00:51:54,161 --> 00:51:56,920
this is not my color. So my cousin,
I would drop or I'll say, hey,

911
00:51:56,921 --> 00:51:59,810
sell this and I'll be right back.
I'm gonna park the car so I'll crack.

912
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:03,970
Kay was like rabbit, um, the police's
ups up on the heel, on the ground,

913
00:52:03,971 --> 00:52:08,890
laying down before I could make it back
to pick up my cousin, she was like 15,

914
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:13,990
he went down there and fucking arrested
her and took her to where she hid the

915
00:52:13,991 --> 00:52:18,850
drugs at. And so he issued a warrant
for me. So I couldn't say it would.

916
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:22,000
No, he had been on the hill taking
pictures all day. I mean all morning.

917
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,470
So that's how I got my first drug charge.
So how long did you go away for? Oh,

918
00:52:26,471 --> 00:52:27,121
I didn't go away.

919
00:52:27,121 --> 00:52:30,970
Then I got probation and then I
got popped again and then I went,

920
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,140
I was in jail a year.

921
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,190
So when you got probation,
did you have any like idea of like,

922
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,340
okay, I can get caught for this real
easy, I got to get out of this business?

923
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:44,540
No, I was like fucking, I
thought I was fucking pound.

924
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:48,110
I was untouchable. I have
money. It's like fuck you,

925
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:51,410
I'll be out in no time and back did when
you first went to jail, like I told you,

926
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:54,170
they used to give you bonds but
they stopped giving you bonds.

927
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,580
So I remember I needed,

928
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:59,540
I had to have a bond here so I had to
pay for the judge in Atlanta to have

929
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:04,040
fucking dancers and he gave me
a $2,500 bond and I was out.

930
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,030
They have the answers. What do you
mean pay for his holes? You get what?

931
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:12,410
Whose hose? The judge you paid
for the judges, prostitutes.

932
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:17,090
How's there was he's there was having
a party. Okay. So my lawyer was like,

933
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:19,880
you got to put in a few extra money.
He's going to give you a bond,

934
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,660
but you gotta put in a few extra money.
So I put in the extra money,

935
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,180
pay for the holes and it gave me a $25,000

936
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:26,760
bond.

937
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,850
I called my friend frog who I was selling
drugs with at the time cause we was

938
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:31,890
partners like,
come fucking get me.

939
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,520
So the judge went and took your
money and got prostitutes. Yeah.

940
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:37,710
That's hilarious.

941
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:41,840
I never see any, but that's
what the lawyer you, you know,

942
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,020
that's what the lawyer said.
Yeah.

943
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,280
Kev verify that can go
forward with this information.

944
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,210
It was true that it was,

945
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,620
I mean that's one of those things
that like people would know about.

946
00:53:51,621 --> 00:53:55,490
Did you have that? There's
a judge [inaudible] was
cricket back then. Oh my God,

947
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,700
that's a bad position to put a person in.

948
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:01,680
Do you remember the judge's
name was a judge Matthews? No.

949
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:06,170
Who's judge Matthew is a great judge.
Who was that?

950
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:07,640
Celebrity judges.

951
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,830
Oh yeah.

952
00:54:09,831 --> 00:54:12,620
There's something about being a judge
that I think is unhealthy position.

953
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,400
I don't think anybody should have that
kind of power over someone like to decide

954
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,640
to send someone to jail,
to not send someone to jail,

955
00:54:19,641 --> 00:54:23,480
send someone to jail for 30
days or 90 days or I just don't.

956
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,410
I just think that that kind of power,
I think there should be rules.

957
00:54:27,411 --> 00:54:27,981
Most certainly,

958
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:30,860
but I think that kind of power bestowed
upon a person to make that sort of a

959
00:54:30,861 --> 00:54:33,950
decision and thrown discretion is just,
it's too much.

960
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,540
It's too much responsibility.

961
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:38,990
You can't trust someone to be totally
ethical and not fucking crazy.

962
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,370
And people change too.

963
00:54:40,371 --> 00:54:44,390
They get more crazy as they get older and
they get more crazy with ego. You know,

964
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,880
people get nutty.
This,

965
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:48,560
there's a lot of nutty people that get
a little bit of attention and then they

966
00:54:48,561 --> 00:54:52,850
just fucking go off the deep end, go off
the deep end, believe their own bullshit.

967
00:54:52,851 --> 00:54:56,710
And if you're a judge, everyone's
kissing your ass all day all day,

968
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,270
but you wear the robes, you come
in the honorable, they fucking the,

969
00:55:00,271 --> 00:55:03,590
everybody has to rise where you come
into the room. What kind of Shit is that?

970
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,010
Everybody else has to stand up because
you're here and they call you the

971
00:55:07,011 --> 00:55:09,110
honorable.
Get the fuck Outta here.

972
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,430
There was a guy they busted recently
was using a penis pump while he was,

973
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,440
while he was presiding over cases.

974
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:19,830
Yeah, penis pump. Awesome. This
is walking any up is paying them.

975
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:23,880
Sitting there talking to people and
underneath the table he's jerking himself

976
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:26,280
off with a giant tube and a pump

977
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:33,340
and they're like, what are you doing
man? And they catch homeboy went flat.

978
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:34,693
Yeah,

979
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,080
he's

980
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:45,940
just a guy. He's just a guy. No
one deserves to be a judge. No one.

981
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:48,610
You can't be a judge. He can't
be the king either. By the way,

982
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,080
you can't be a president.

983
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,260
That shit was for dumb people
that didn't know any better.

984
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,250
We in 2014 with the
information that we have today,

985
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:02,560
all she need is Google.
All we need is let people vote on shit.

986
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:06,910
Okay? Let the entire country vote on
every goddamn thing that gets done ever.

987
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:12,210
You can't have one person that has any
overthe oversight or power over everybody

988
00:56:12,341 --> 00:56:16,030
else, whether it's a judge or
anything, you know, I mean,

989
00:56:16,031 --> 00:56:18,250
I don't know how you would
do it as far as like cases,

990
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,160
as far as like prosecuting people.
I don't,

991
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:21,670
I don't know how you would
do it without a judge,

992
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:23,920
but it's gotta be a better way to jail.
No.

993
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:27,520
Oh. Oh, that's a horrible
thing. The food is horrible.

994
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,900
When I was a little kid and they closed
the cell and they leave you leave you in

995
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:32,734
there for about five seconds,

996
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,900
San Francisco. So every time I go, he's
like, you want to visit the ACA tray?

997
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,830
I was like, look, you dumb. Fuck
you don't ask a convicted felon.

998
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:44,510
Do they want to get volunteer visa?
Fucking old jail. No, I don't own a visit.

999
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,480
I architraves I've been to jail before.
I know what he looked like.

1000
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,750
There's something also about
people that go to jail.

1001
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,710
It's a lot like people that have been
to war or people that have gotten over

1002
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:57,250
some of my very traumatic event is that
they have a certain kind of strength.

1003
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,860
There's a certain kind of strength
that a person has when they,

1004
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:03,790
they're the people that decide like,
I am fucking never going back there.

1005
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,550
Well, yeah. Some people,

1006
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:08,370
like I got some brothers who had been
in and out of jail out a fucking life.

1007
00:57:08,371 --> 00:57:09,790
Some people like going back.

1008
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:14,791
My brother in law's do for me when I miss
my daughter going to kindergarten from

1009
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:19,930
doing a year in jail, that totally
fucked me up. And I, you know,

1010
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:23,830
my by me, by me having that lifestyle,
not really nothing that I chose,

1011
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:28,810
but what I went through. I did not have
a bun with my daughter Joe for years.

1012
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:30,610
And I don't,
I don't know if you have any kids,

1013
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:35,611
but when you have a kid that deeply
probably hate you for the life that you

1014
00:57:36,701 --> 00:57:38,970
chose, you know, to, to, to help her,

1015
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:43,120
she didn't realize I was doing this
shit so I can make better for you.

1016
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,060
You know,
me missing school and meet me missing her.

1017
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:49,990
Go to kindergarten and you know,
me selling drugs and hurting people.

1018
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,920
Me and my daughter did not have
a fucking bond for a long time.

1019
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:58,780
So when I brought my husband into her
life, she immediately bond with him.

1020
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:00,550
But I was always the bad

1021
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,850
person. Wow. Well, she probably
looked at him as like the same thing.

1022
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,610
He was the savior. He wants to say
she has a bun out of these words.

1023
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:10,250
Now we talk every day.
Even we and,

1024
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,410
and you know another thing
is when I went to prison,

1025
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:17,400
then I got out and I really fucking hate
it. And I hate to say this is cause he,

1026
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,850
your pocket is so fucking [inaudible]
hope people don't take it the wrong way.

1027
00:58:19,851 --> 00:58:24,470
I hated gay women. I don't know.
I could deal with gay men's,

1028
00:58:24,471 --> 00:58:27,950
but I saw so much other than shit in
jail. No, I never been with a woman.

1029
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:31,310
Nobody fuck with me because I fall out
of time. But I just hated the shit.

1030
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:35,570
And then when it, when it came into my
life, my daughter is gay, I was like,

1031
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,060
Oh fuck, how stupid am I? You can't deal.

1032
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:41,870
You can't judge people and they sexuality.
So all during my,

1033
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,200
when I was raising my daughter out,

1034
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,560
she always ended up getting a gay fucking
cheerleading coach and I hated this

1035
00:58:48,561 --> 00:58:53,360
bitch and my daughter, no, I hated gay
women's. So, but my daughter was gay.

1036
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:57,680
So that's another thing that did not
allow her to bond with me because she knew

1037
00:58:57,681 --> 00:58:59,180
my hatred for gay women.

1038
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,370
Wow, that's intense. Oh it shit.

1039
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,160
So would answer me this if you can.

1040
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,450
What do you think it is about the black
community that shuns gay people or shuns

1041
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:11,350
like gay marriage?

1042
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,920
Cause I was like a big issue in California
here they had proposition eight,

1043
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:18,700
proposition eight is that what it
is? The Bible's religion. Yeah.

1044
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:23,300
You know, black people believe no
matter what they believe, it's a god.

1045
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,260
You know, we'd go on to heaven or
hell, that's just how we taught.

1046
00:59:27,261 --> 00:59:30,950
And I think a lot of that shit come from
because our ancestors were slaves and,

1047
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:35,270
and it just, I think it just rolled on
through the genes. But we believe too,

1048
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,520
that's what it is. Yes. But it seems,

1049
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:40,850
it's so style 2014 you know,

1050
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:44,520
it seems so discriminatory when you see
that people are born gay. It's just,

1051
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,490
I have a gay daughter that
I'm very supportive and I
don't feel that way anymore.

1052
00:59:49,491 --> 00:59:53,390
It's almost like a white dude and his
door though to bring home a white,

1053
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,850
a white guy, daughter brought
home a black dude. I mean,

1054
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:56,940
you either going to get over it,

1055
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:59,190
a fucking jump off of a
bridge and realize that you,

1056
00:59:59,191 --> 01:00:02,930
the person that has the problem, not
them. And that's what I had to realize,

1057
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,200
you know, because these bitches was Inga
puts it in jail and I didn't like them.

1058
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:09,140
Well
these are not,

1059
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,900
these are not the gay people
who my daughters bring it over.

1060
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:15,470
So now I'm very fucking supportive.
Whatever makes my daughter happy.

1061
01:00:15,471 --> 01:00:18,710
Plus you got to remember,
here I am, 15 years old,

1062
01:00:18,711 --> 01:00:22,640
getting fucking dogged out by
her daddy. Beat on, shot on,

1063
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:25,340
fucking knocked around,
cheated on, you know,

1064
01:00:25,341 --> 01:00:28,610
she just saw so fucking much
that I think turn, you know,

1065
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,610
fucking like fuck means them Niggas
ain't right. So I think that that was,

1066
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:37,100
that's part of the issue too. She say she
was born gay. I say in my fucking wound,

1067
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:39,530
bitch, the ultrasound you
is not leaking anything.

1068
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:46,070
So, I mean, do I know, I don't
know if she was born gay,

1069
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:50,270
but she's gay and I support her decision
to be gay. That's my first born.

1070
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:53,450
And I loved the hell out of her. You
know, like when she first came out,

1071
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,110
because when she went to college and she
left town because she knew how much I

1072
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:00,020
hated gay women's and I ain't seen
my own fucking child for three years.

1073
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,660
I would try to contact her.
She was out in the rural,

1074
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:06,350
been homeless and I was like, what is your
fucking problem? What is your problem?

1075
01:01:06,351 --> 01:01:09,320
I said, if you gay, just say
you gay. She said, I'm gas.

1076
01:01:09,321 --> 01:01:13,190
What can you come home bitch?
Cause I mean three fucking years.

1077
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:18,530
And now we talk every day we talk.
And I love the hell out my daughter.

1078
01:01:18,531 --> 01:01:22,580
She got them. I got a wonderful daughter
in law. They look just like, um,

1079
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:27,120
who did I say? She looked
like? Um, Paula, Paula,

1080
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:28,380
Paula [inaudible],

1081
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:34,560
Paula Robin.

1082
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,850
Think my daughter Robin Thicke.

1083
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:43,680
Paula Poundstone you wrong.
No, but I've seen her.

1084
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:54,460
Yeah. So you know, I'm
a supportive mom now.

1085
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,330
I mean, I love my daughter. I love my kids
to death. I have four of them, you know,

1086
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,720
and we talked about the shit that I'd
taken her through from putting the drugs

1087
01:02:01,721 --> 01:02:06,390
in her underwear too. You
know, me dropping out of
school, she was there with it.

1088
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:09,860
But she must feel different about you now.
Shit, I'm not fucking heat around that.

1089
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,860
And she's mine.
I mean,

1090
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:15,040
because she did something that I
never had an opportunity to do.

1091
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:18,700
She didn't get pregnant in high school.
She didn't. I mean she didn't, she,

1092
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:22,110
you know, went on and graduated
one when she graduated. Joe,

1093
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:25,020
I say I fucking made it.

1094
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:28,710
I thought it was nothing that you could've
killed me that day because you know

1095
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:32,430
why? None of my cousin kids
graduated. Nobody else.

1096
01:02:32,431 --> 01:02:36,660
My fucking Ashley is walking down his eye.
I made it.

1097
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:39,600
I couldn't stop crying. And she was
like, what are you crying? I was like,

1098
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:43,290
if only you knew what I did
to get you to this point,

1099
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,430
you broke a fucking cycle that has
been going on in my family for three

1100
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:51,390
generations. I didn't even cry like that
when I took her to college, but boy,

1101
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:56,220
when she graduated high school, I pick up
that diploma once a week and say, bitch,

1102
01:02:56,221 --> 01:03:00,630
we made it in a high school
diploma and we'll have shit.

1103
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,600
It's about it equals to my GED

1104
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,750
yet today, right? Yeah.

1105
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,060
Even a college diploma.
It's so hard.

1106
01:03:10,061 --> 01:03:13,140
You hear stories about people getting
out of college and looking for a job now

1107
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:14,710
it's like,
it's so confusing.

1108
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:18,810
It is. I mean it's, it's hard.
I met, I tell my kids all
the time, I made my money.

1109
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:22,590
You could probably ever do doing shit
that you really want to do because when

1110
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:24,930
you go to college, you,
you're going for, you know,

1111
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:26,370
you don't really know what
the fuck you want to do.

1112
01:03:26,371 --> 01:03:30,600
You want to go and get high and fuck
the first year, that's all. My daughter,

1113
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:32,490
my daughter went to college and I,
you know what?

1114
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:35,760
I paid for her to issue the whole
three years she was there. I said,

1115
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:39,540
because you were not struggle. Do you
know? She went to college in eight,

1116
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:40,680
puts it on my dime.

1117
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:46,920
She Ain't put on my time like crazy.
She was trying to find herself.

1118
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,023
Yes.

1119
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,340
Losing back teeth and shit.
I was like,

1120
01:03:53,341 --> 01:03:57,570
you gotta Stop [inaudible] Pussy.

1121
01:03:57,571 --> 01:04:00,630
You gotta Eat Blue Cross Blue Shield.
You lose your back teeth.

1122
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:05,130
We need post when you eat bad pussy
joke. What defines bad? But I don't know.

1123
01:04:05,131 --> 01:04:06,270
I can call my daughter.

1124
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:14,720
I don't know.
You know

1125
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:19,510
that is crazy. Wow.
That's a hilarious story.

1126
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:23,260
It's got to be a nice thing to
be where you're at now though.

1127
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:28,650
Yes. I'm happy. How Ain't been doing
stand up 11 years? I've been married 23.

1128
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:31,950
Wow. So, so 11 years ago this uh,

1129
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:35,220
this person at the welfare office
tells you you should do stand up.

1130
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,390
So what do you do from there?

1131
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:41,350
I go home and I told him, I was like,
my case worker say I'm funny. He's like,

1132
01:04:41,351 --> 01:04:45,240
can you sit down and be quiet? So that's
among, got an open Mike. He was like, ah,

1133
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:49,040
go home pat miles. Isn't that a type
he's not going to say don't do it either.

1134
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:52,010
Whatever. Cause I was in the
process, he must have husband saw me.

1135
01:04:52,011 --> 01:04:55,300
You'd go from a drug dealer
to forging checks to fucking,

1136
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,870
I got a little Venice service
at the Georgia Dome when
Michael Vick first became

1137
01:04:58,871 --> 01:05:03,400
our, our quarterback. So I'm making a
ton of mine money with inner city kids,

1138
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:04,930
with a nonprofit organization.

1139
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:08,650
So he saw me go from nat and then all
of a sudden you want to be a standard.

1140
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,140
And he's like, how many time are you
going to change your career? I said,

1141
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:16,030
until I fucking find myself. So I get my
girlfriend, which is a long story short.

1142
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:19,510
My baby's baby mama lived
around the corner from me.

1143
01:05:19,511 --> 01:05:23,410
This is a chickie show up at the hospital
after I give birth to his first child.

1144
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:26,140
So she,
we became best friends.

1145
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:31,360
I swear we said we raised the kids,
his cousins,

1146
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:34,540
because she had a baby by him too.
So I get her and I was like,

1147
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:37,960
this case worker say I'm funny, let's
go to open mic. And I go up there,

1148
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:41,260
Joe and I fucking killed. And
I, my first time I told him,

1149
01:05:41,261 --> 01:05:45,370
I told a story about my brother was a
professional cat burglar, but he was fat.

1150
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:48,730
So he kicked this lady door and
one time he's like freeze bitch,

1151
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:51,010
I'm the FBI gimme your TV and your VCR.

1152
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:55,670
So I stuck tp and ran out the dough
cause he broken houses everyday.

1153
01:05:55,750 --> 01:06:00,370
And that was my first joke. That's
hilarious. And so when you did that,

1154
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,790
did you run in and shit?
I don't know cause I grew up in,

1155
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:08,320
I started in an urban rooms, so I started
to follow the arbitrary, I Suck Dick,

1156
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:12,450
I eat booty.
You know how black people do the shit.

1157
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:18,880
You seen def jam shit.
And then I was like,

1158
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:22,000
I look up and I got that drug
dealer mentality. I was like,

1159
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:25,360
well I'm not sticking out. I'm doing
everything and these motherfuckers doing.

1160
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:28,300
And I was like, it's gotta be
something better here. I'm not growing.

1161
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:29,860
I'm make making $50 a week.

1162
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:34,030
This is how to dope gang work because
everything is like the dope game to me.

1163
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:38,560
It must elevate.
And so when my husband got transferred to,

1164
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:42,490
it was either Detroit,
St Louis or Indianapolis and I was like,

1165
01:06:42,491 --> 01:06:45,820
you're not going to kill my kids in
those other cities. And he chose,

1166
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:49,180
I wanted to go to Texas, so he chose in
Annapolis. So I'll walk in out with this.

1167
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,580
Uh,
I walk into a mainstream club at a time,

1168
01:06:51,581 --> 01:06:55,810
which was mortise and I got
this urban flair and he's like,

1169
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:00,670
not here bitches. We don't do roaches
jokes. So it forces jokes. Yeah.

1170
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:04,120
Roaches. You know how you see a black?
Yeah. You haven't had a roach drank out.

1171
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:07,570
Y'All cool late. Oh I
get it. Yeah. You know,

1172
01:07:07,571 --> 01:07:11,330
you're not roaches, you
know, and, and the uh,

1173
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:14,710
then you got the jokes about
the government cheese and shit.

1174
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:18,730
So when I moved to Indianapolis and they'd
be like, you can't do that shit here,

1175
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,740
you know, no matter, no, no,
I didn't have fucking roaches.

1176
01:07:20,741 --> 01:07:21,880
Where the fuck are you talking about?

1177
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:26,290
So it forced me to open
up to my life that I had,

1178
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,570
which was way more interesting while,

1179
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:31,810
so you were trying to just do what
everybody else was doing and then go into

1180
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:36,020
this white neighborhood going to the
white neighborhood when we moved. Fuck me.

1181
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:42,130
Fuck me. Cause I never been, you know,
like I never read club. Yeah, it is.

1182
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:44,590
Yeah.
It's a great club.

1183
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:49,030
I've worked there before and it was a
little black owner at the time when he's

1184
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:50,950
in jail for bank robbery
and that motherfucker

1185
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:58,960
last year with no guns, just showed
him all 32 of his cabinet get up.

1186
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:06,370
When I got to in Annapolis,
I had to change who I was,

1187
01:08:06,371 --> 01:08:11,160
so I had to find myself and I just
started talking about my life, which was,

1188
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:11,921
you know,

1189
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,590
kind of embarrassing to kids that are
15 dropped out in eighth you know,

1190
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,760
you'd think if people go on fucking,

1191
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,190
I thought I was the only
teenage mom on the road.

1192
01:08:19,191 --> 01:08:22,310
I thought I was the only bitch and I am
the only one probably missing the nipple

1193
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:25,520
that's going to tail.
But all of this stuff that happened to me,

1194
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:26,870
I thought it was just me.

1195
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:31,460
Did I learn fucking teenage pregnancy
happen in every race? Yeah. Well,

1196
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:32,390
there's a whole show on it.

1197
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,690
You know what the fuck was that
show at when I had my baby?

1198
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:40,110
You better off without it. You're
better off becoming you and now. Yeah.

1199
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,810
Getting famous. You could
handle it better. Yes.

1200
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:46,040
So when I got to Indianapolis,
Shit changed.

1201
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:50,180
I moved to a white neighborhood and
I just started to work on my sip.

1202
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:55,460
So do you do a right like material or
do you always talk about your life like

1203
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:58,040
I right like stuff about
being married key is,

1204
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:02,060
most of my stuff is personal so
you know where everybody gets it.

1205
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:05,960
You know my life,
you know middle drug dealer.

1206
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:10,330
I talk a lot about my mom
who was an alcoholic mom who
used to give me the worse

1207
01:09:10,331 --> 01:09:11,840
is vice.
Like she was like shit,

1208
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:15,710
like a reach for the stars and I
hope you hit this sun and burn up.

1209
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:20,180
So it was true.
I told my husband the other day,

1210
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:24,320
my mom was so fucking stupid. She was,
I'm not going to say she was stupid,

1211
01:09:24,321 --> 01:09:26,330
she didn't know shit
like she couldn't read.

1212
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,910
So she will force me to re Jahari scope.

1213
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:31,160
But when she didn't know
I couldn't read either.

1214
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:35,000
So I would just make up shit every day.

1215
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:38,690
I made a bullshit bullshit.
And she went forward.

1216
01:09:38,691 --> 01:09:42,600
Like I was saying cause she was shooting
at us like she told a 22 pills her

1217
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,580
because she was, my mama was a very small
lady so she walked around a 22 pills.

1218
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:49,500
She's carried it everywhere. Oh yeah. And
we're like, we wouldn't wash the dishes,

1219
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:52,970
washed them goddamn dishes and we
can shoot it into the ceiling. Yes.

1220
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,040
And when it rain it showed,

1221
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,980
so when it rained,

1222
01:09:56,981 --> 01:09:59,830
water would come dripping through the
halls and she left by shooting the scene.

1223
01:09:59,831 --> 01:09:59,930
Yeah.

1224
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:00,340
There's one,

1225
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:03,980
why don't fuck the ceiling league cause
bitch you don't put 22 of them holes in

1226
01:10:03,981 --> 01:10:05,690
the ceiling or what the
fuck are you talking about?

1227
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:09,550
Wow. Yeah. That's a way
to motivate kids though.

1228
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:13,330
And we will shoot out to her.
We were scared of her. She did.

1229
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:20,270
She was never pointed at us. He was
like, I'll just shoot a light out. Wow.

1230
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,400
So God damn,

1231
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:25,490
what we got used to him like
he go mama with is bullshit.

1232
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:29,930
Did she ever shoot at you?
And he shot at me one time

1233
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,330
I was on the phone with my baby daddy.

1234
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,290
I was on the phone with my baby that she's
like get the fuck out. The phone's on.

1235
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:41,530
My mom was like pre handicap cause we
lived in the project and the security

1236
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:45,660
guard fucking body slammed him
fucked up her spine. So she is,

1237
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,240
she sit down, she couldn't get met
good. So we had to be that a lift up.

1238
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:52,760
So I knew I wanted to talk a little phone.
My Baby Daddy,

1239
01:10:52,761 --> 01:10:55,040
it's time I'm at this time I'm
pregnant with my second child.

1240
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:57,470
So my mom was like get off the
phone with that motherfucker.

1241
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:59,570
He's going to get you pregnant.
That's somebody else husband.

1242
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:02,630
So I tell my kids while I was like
hold on, why go ahead and lay her down.

1243
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,580
And she was only like 98 pounds.

1244
01:11:04,581 --> 01:11:07,400
So I picked up and later in the
bathroom on the floor and I'm like,

1245
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:10,370
you stay right there until I get
through talking to my baby daddy. What?

1246
01:11:10,371 --> 01:11:14,040
I didn't know Joe is that bitch go crawl.
She crowd on that

1247
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,280
bathroom like military style with
that shotgun and shot at my hand.

1248
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,620
I flew out the door.

1249
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,730
She shot at you with a shock shotgun.
What a shot gun.

1250
01:11:22,731 --> 01:11:25,790
She got it out of the closet.
She got it.

1251
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:29,660
She shot at you with a shotgun because
you were on the phone with a man and you

1252
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:30,620
put her on the floor?

1253
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:33,080
Yeah, put on the floor and she
couldn't get up, so I was like,

1254
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:36,260
if you don't start shooting, who the fuck
gonna get you off the floor? Oh my God.

1255
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:40,820
So how did you guys resolve that
age? He ran out of bullets. Oh,

1256
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,100
what did she shoot? Does she shoot
just holes in your house? Yeah,

1257
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:48,660
she would just shoot up anything. We
will give up getting evicted. It wasn't,

1258
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:51,680
she was like, you would be watching
the TV and she would tell you to move.

1259
01:11:51,681 --> 01:11:53,740
She'll blow the mother fuck
out if you didn't move.

1260
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,430
Really?
How many times you shoot the TV?

1261
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:00,320
Just once because we
can afford another one.

1262
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:03,900
It was only to wanting to know
for the kids and one for her.

1263
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,690
How much material do you think?
Like I would say,

1264
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,750
if you're going to become a
big name stand up comedian,

1265
01:12:09,751 --> 01:12:11,730
you're going to have to put
out a bunch of specials. Right.

1266
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:16,830
So if you put out how many specials can
you do on your life before you have to

1267
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:17,940
start talking about other shit?

1268
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:21,890
Probably four or five. Four or five
specials. Just cause you know what?

1269
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:26,420
A lot of stuff that I remember like it
was so at the time like I can laugh at it

1270
01:12:26,421 --> 01:12:31,220
now, but back then it was paying. So I
didn't get on drugs like my sister did.

1271
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:31,740
I didn't,

1272
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:34,940
my brother did and got on drugs to deal
with bullshit that we was going through.

1273
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,510
I just, they, you know, sobering
thought he loves goes crazy.

1274
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:43,070
So to get rid of the pain, I just kept
putting it in the back of my head.

1275
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,830
I didn't want to remember it.
So when I became a comic,

1276
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,640
all of this shit start rushing
through my brain and how the x,

1277
01:12:49,641 --> 01:12:52,760
my sister bitches this real,
I just asked my sister the other day,

1278
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:56,240
my granddad and ran a bootleg house.
So in this bootleg house,

1279
01:12:56,241 --> 01:12:59,150
I had a retarded uncle named
uncle Cecil that was crippled,

1280
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:02,300
but my granddad or we'll
buy him pussy on Friday,

1281
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:06,230
but me and my sister would have to go in
there with the prostitute and hold his

1282
01:13:06,231 --> 01:13:10,010
legs back until he get his dicky
before we could go outside and play.

1283
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,370
So I called her up and I said,
is this shit

1284
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:16,520
you get a hold his legs back cause these
will cripple you know how when they

1285
01:13:16,521 --> 01:13:17,354
need,

1286
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,790
well he couldn't get it in until
we move to this fucking legs bag.

1287
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:23,450
Wow.

1288
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:26,870
Oh I remember what to ask.
Like hurry up probably eight.

1289
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:31,400
I was like, oh see so stop fucking
smile because they were retarded. He's

1290
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:40,140
awful. He's so fucking off. And
I asked my brother, I was like,

1291
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,860
do y'all remember this shit? I'm
going crazy and all. I'm like,

1292
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,900
come on brother.
Last weekend I said my mommy

1293
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:51,560
had his theory. She's saying when
when it rains and the sun is shining,

1294
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:55,320
the devil was beating his wife. You
ever heard of that? Yes. And then she,

1295
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,160
if it will rain and lightning and
the son was shot. He called him miss

1296
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,680
g. He's always, he's, my mom was like,

1297
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:06,570
you should be the beach cause she
don't believe in God fucking damn.

1298
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:12,130
I used to,
they stole me

1299
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:15,190
Joe and it's fucking crazy.

1300
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:20,530
He should beat her.
She doesn't believe Holy Shit.

1301
01:14:20,531 --> 01:14:23,110
And she shooting at you.
She's a shoe.

1302
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:27,580
I was just thinking the irony in that,
you know,

1303
01:14:27,581 --> 01:14:32,050
does God want you shooting your fucking
Jesus Christ?

1304
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,350
I can't hear you ma.

1305
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,790
Well the trigger. Oh my God. Wow.

1306
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:41,110
And we was getting her ass for years. We
were scared of her. Well in her defense,

1307
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,990
probably very hard to raise a bunch
of kids. What happened to her back?

1308
01:14:43,991 --> 01:14:47,590
Someone slammed on her bag. Okay. We lived
in the projects. She was the candy lady.

1309
01:14:47,591 --> 01:14:51,550
So she, my Mama, my Candy
Lady, Candy Lady, that's when
that's the late in the hood.

1310
01:14:51,551 --> 01:14:55,000
They sell the free freeze, pop the
candy, the cookies to the kids.

1311
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:58,840
And my momma did it because we was in the
project and that money helped her with

1312
01:14:58,841 --> 01:15:00,460
her light bills or whatever the fuck.

1313
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:02,830
And she used to talk shit
to the security guard.

1314
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:07,090
This back for the projects were really
dangerous. So the security guard was like,

1315
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,140
Mildred,
you,

1316
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:12,460
you cannot sell candy because it's fucking
earn income and you're not reporting.

1317
01:15:12,461 --> 01:15:15,010
But he was just fucking with him because
my mom had talked to a lot of crap.

1318
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,690
So she's like, Oh fuck you security to
God, you're ugly face whatever she said.

1319
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:21,970
So he came on, he says, I'm
gonna come whoop y'all aids.

1320
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:26,500
And I had to be about probably seven.
That dude came in and beat the dog. Shit.

1321
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:30,060
I was into wrestling at the time
he was in a DDT and his shit at my,

1322
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,550
before he came in the house,
she gave me my sister to cash,

1323
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,520
like go flush this shit.
He owned away.

1324
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:40,480
So we're in the bathroom popping pixie
stick like cocaine eating the shit.

1325
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,370
He Ain't no whooping her ass.
So he,

1326
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,180
he hit her up against a wall
and fucked her spinal. Whoa.

1327
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,040
So she sued the housing authority,

1328
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:50,950
but she couldn't read and the fucking
lawyer took all the money and we got put

1329
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:55,450
out of the projects. So, oh, that's
what that when it damaged her spine,

1330
01:15:55,451 --> 01:15:58,150
like she could no longer
hold of her neck up.

1331
01:15:58,151 --> 01:16:00,160
Like if she be talking
that bits fall over.

1332
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:03,830
So she had to keep us to keep our
up while she was driving all mine.

1333
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:10,030
One incident with this guy did
that? Yes. She was like 90 pounds.

1334
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:14,800
What happened to him? I don't know.
I was a kid. I don't really know.

1335
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:19,090
I remember going to court and
testifying, you know, you know,

1336
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:22,600
uh sorry I got grace jokes about it.
You know,

1337
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:27,310
cause like
she would do shit.

1338
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:29,390
It's e even though her
neck with fucked up,

1339
01:16:29,391 --> 01:16:32,810
she was determined to do nominate people
shit like going across the drug to

1340
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,140
like go across the track too fast.

1341
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:40,730
And once I see she had a 64 Chevy that
used to bounce and she loved like old

1342
01:16:40,731 --> 01:16:42,440
music.
So we're not just bouncing,

1343
01:16:42,441 --> 01:16:44,930
listen to BB king and she
going to beat the train.

1344
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,360
That bitch hit that first tracking that

1345
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:52,220
she's like coming muscles to slap the
shit out of her neck and then went through

1346
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:56,990
the most stern.
We had to jump out to sea in Hola.

1347
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:01,020
Nica she drive across the track.
She pulled out yo pitches hit me too hard.

1348
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:04,680
My son was like miss the train was
coming. Oh my God, you bitches.

1349
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:10,460
Holy Shit. So she could, she could walk

1350
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,780
and she could use her feet,

1351
01:17:11,781 --> 01:17:16,210
but she just had a bunch that I know
about that she had a boyfriend. My house,

1352
01:17:16,211 --> 01:17:19,040
he couldn't so he knew, cause he never
called us in. Now the picker Nica

1353
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,720
is that what you would draw the line?
I want to wait and pick the neck up.

1354
01:17:23,721 --> 01:17:27,050
I hit my crip arc or fuck.
It just seems different though.

1355
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:31,820
It seems like one more level.
I mean not everything went.

1356
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:37,070
It's nothing that I did not
see as a key murder. Fuck yeah.

1357
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:41,360
I tell you before I tell you about myself
more murder. When I was a drug dealer,

1358
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:45,590
that's when I really saw myrtle. But I
had a guy and I lived in our backyard.

1359
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:50,540
W W well we lived in some apartments
and this is when heron and she came out

1360
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:55,070
very popular in the black community.
So my next door neighbor used to shoot up,

1361
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:58,190
but my mama used to shoot up too,
but it was diabetic medication.

1362
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:01,730
So I will walk out there and as I walk
out the side one day on the back porch

1363
01:18:01,731 --> 01:18:05,060
and I'm sitting there, so he shooted
what I thought was diabetic medication.

1364
01:18:05,061 --> 01:18:09,190
He get bud as naked Joe run over
to me, Ben Dover, he's like rabid,

1365
01:18:09,191 --> 01:18:13,610
get the red out of my ass. So I'm looking
up this dude as for a rat and I'm like,

1366
01:18:13,611 --> 01:18:17,090
JB has no ready your diabetes fucking up.
I was like,

1367
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:18,650
the red is hanging in the front.

1368
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:23,090
So he thought he got nick and
every weekend nobody said Shit.

1369
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:26,990
You were telling him was his diabetes
medicine. That's what I thought it was.

1370
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:33,620
Bs Medicine has you thinking is right
up your ass. But it was, it was heroin.

1371
01:18:33,621 --> 01:18:36,110
I learned. We learned later
that he was shooting arrows.

1372
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,900
So it when he got naked on Friday,
we're like, Jamie, I just high.

1373
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:42,080
He'd be all right. There's
only one day he got naked. No,

1374
01:18:42,081 --> 01:18:46,010
he got naked every time he shot drugs.
How many days a week to be shoot drugs?

1375
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:49,850
Shit, two, three. So two
or three days a week.

1376
01:18:49,851 --> 01:18:54,350
He was naked on some people
care. Some people can't. Like
when he wasn't, you know,

1377
01:18:54,351 --> 01:18:58,550
he was a fucking, and he was an
engineer for living and engineer.

1378
01:18:58,551 --> 01:19:02,000
Like he designed things. Yes. That's what
he did for a living. He got on heroin,

1379
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:06,950
very engineered. Running a train.
No, not like that. He designed shit.

1380
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:10,850
He was like fucking corporate America.
He was the shit.

1381
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:15,320
But he came to the ghetto and
got high and take off all.

1382
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:19,990
He felt so embarrassed once
this high came down. Wow.

1383
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,610
And people would just let
Gebo walk around naked.

1384
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:27,410
I wonder if that's like his way of
releasing all the stress of keeping all

1385
01:19:27,411 --> 01:19:29,620
wrapped up,
tightened corporate America.

1386
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:32,660
I think he thinks stuff
was crawling on him.

1387
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,480
So he was just getting negative
indeed his ass. And we'd be like, oh,

1388
01:19:40,481 --> 01:19:43,910
Jay badges naked. He
just hides in his ass. I,

1389
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,120
before we moved in these 44 we
moved in this set of apartments,

1390
01:19:47,121 --> 01:19:50,360
I would go to the wrestling match every
week when we moved in this or set up

1391
01:19:50,361 --> 01:19:54,130
apartments, I stopped going because
it was nothing to see people fighting.

1392
01:19:54,131 --> 01:19:56,390
And you know,
motherfuckers out there acting a fool.

1393
01:19:56,420 --> 01:20:00,860
It was more interested set on my back
porch and there was real wow. Dot.

1394
01:20:00,861 --> 01:20:05,030
It's crazy. Dot. It's gotta
be so bizarre. Be that young.

1395
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,040
You get a pull one guy's legs

1396
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,320
apart to see how big fuck.

1397
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,550
Another guy that's running
around naked and he's on heroin.

1398
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:17,210
That was the norm when you
were in this situation.

1399
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:21,860
Nothing else seems what you doing
the right shit is out of place.

1400
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:25,140
What I'm doing, this is what
I'm used to. If that's okay.

1401
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:27,770
We're thinking about human beings
are very adaptable, you know,

1402
01:20:27,771 --> 01:20:30,650
that's what they're saying about
people that live in any country,

1403
01:20:30,651 --> 01:20:34,940
watched tribal people and you go,
why don't these people don't have any TVs?

1404
01:20:34,941 --> 01:20:37,880
They don't have any electricity. Like
they don't even know what that is. Like.

1405
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:40,610
This is normal to them.
And you see people in those villages,

1406
01:20:40,611 --> 01:20:44,510
they find in the Amazon, they don't
have any contact with human beings.

1407
01:20:44,511 --> 01:20:48,320
We feel bad for them. But what are
they doing? They're just being people,

1408
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:51,320
being people that figured out
how to live there, you know?

1409
01:20:51,321 --> 01:20:55,460
And you were a person who figured out
how to live in your, your wild world.

1410
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,410
How wow.
Or that was a wild world.

1411
01:20:57,411 --> 01:21:01,340
I mean it might as well just been the
wild of the Amazon or the wild of the

1412
01:21:01,341 --> 01:21:05,960
forest or the wild of the city. It's
just wild. There's varying degrees,

1413
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:07,180
right? Yeah. Cause there's,

1414
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:12,250
there's places where shit is just wild
and where you were living craziness.

1415
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:15,830
So we should make a movie about your life.
Like you should.

1416
01:21:15,831 --> 01:21:19,700
That's what you should do. You should
write a movie, be all the best stories.

1417
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:24,680
Completely, totally factual.
Completely, totally accurate. Insane.

1418
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:29,570
That would be a fucking chaotic movie.
Yeah. I'll see a 15 year old girl,

1419
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:30,350
a 15 year old girl,

1420
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:34,160
get her tits shut off while she's
holding her baby and dealing drugs.

1421
01:21:34,161 --> 01:21:37,640
And this guy's running around naked.
He's got a rabbit up his ass.

1422
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:41,870
And you're thinking he's
on diabetes medicine. Yeah,

1423
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:46,980
I was naive. Fucking tell you
more stories please. Please do.

1424
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,750
I was about probably,
but like I said,

1425
01:21:49,751 --> 01:21:51,880
I was about 10 or 11 so I
had a really nice figure.

1426
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:55,450
So I learned 10 you had a nice figure.
I was fuckable this,

1427
01:21:55,510 --> 01:22:00,070
this third grade honestly.
Are you sure? Yes.

1428
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:02,860
No.
So how do you know?

1429
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:08,020
I remember everybody used to say I was
fine and I didn't know what fine was. Wow.

1430
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:09,730
I tell you this story.

1431
01:22:09,731 --> 01:22:12,880
So I'm body 10 or 11 so sometime
I could just walk away from home.

1432
01:22:12,881 --> 01:22:16,870
Nobody gave a fuck. So I go downtown
to the locker, a Hilton hotel.

1433
01:22:16,871 --> 01:22:19,480
Cause I said I want to go see
what white people doing. You know,

1434
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:23,050
rich white people. Cause I thought
everybody stayed at the Hilton was a rich,

1435
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,570
you know, and plus I went in there
because we didn't have no fucking AC.

1436
01:22:25,571 --> 01:22:27,960
So I was standing in front of the
door when the door was open at AC,

1437
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:29,050
hit me in my fucking face.

1438
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:32,680
So I'm standing at the phone booth
one day and this white man say, hey,

1439
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:36,610
you want to come and go to my room with
me? I'm like, Huh. And he thought like,

1440
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:38,980
like he's jacking his dick and I was like,
okay.

1441
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:43,750
Honestly I go to his room,
Joe and he had me,

1442
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:48,751
Jackie's Dick and I jacked this white
man did and he paid me $100 I'm like,

1443
01:22:50,501 --> 01:22:54,610
are you going to fucking be here tomorrow?
So I'm thinking,

1444
01:22:54,611 --> 01:22:55,960
this is my first job.

1445
01:22:55,961 --> 01:22:59,460
I go home and tell my mom I got a job
downtown Jackson white men's Dicks for

1446
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:02,560
$100 you told her that?
Yeah, she wanted to go.

1447
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,633
God

1448
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:10,920
Oh oh dollars in the
ghetto for jacking digs.

1449
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,000
Who might get some oatmeal cookies?

1450
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:17,800
You don't get no damn hundred dollars
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1451
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:24,330
How old were you at the time is 1111 you
told your mother you got a job jacket

1452
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:29,700
off white men's Dicks for $100 and
she wants to go with you. Yeah.

1453
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,270
That might be the craziest fucking
story to tell so far. Say it.

1454
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:35,680
They're not hiring you to
fucking, oh, you're not

1455
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,780
the only at 14th.
And she wasn't really cute.

1456
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:48,370
It's funny that you have to qualify
that he 14 but she was cute.

1457
01:23:48,371 --> 01:23:51,740
As fun as she wasn't cute
at all, you know, but you,

1458
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:55,690
I mean once you only have four teeth,
it's like what is really cute?

1459
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:58,690
I don't like your tone.

1460
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:02,470
Something about being toothless
is not that appealing to us. Wow.

1461
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:06,310
That is so crazy. Your mom
wanted to go with you? Yeah.

1462
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,030
Well No,
it was

1463
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:12,140
when I was, um, where was all
this go? What city was this
again? Atlanto is awesome.

1464
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:15,980
It really started in a bootleg house.
This is the one I knew she was fucked up.

1465
01:24:15,981 --> 01:24:16,940
Like on Friday,

1466
01:24:17,490 --> 01:24:21,470
my grandfather customer was just
fall asleep and why they were sleep.

1467
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:26,510
My Mama would make me rob them and
for every person that I robbed,

1468
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:30,680
I got $5 per person and I
probably was seven or eight.

1469
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:36,110
I remember that shit like yesterday and
I told us that you taken advantage of me.

1470
01:24:36,111 --> 01:24:41,111
I should be making more money and so
extra for 10% cause I had been watching

1471
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:44,240
sesame street but neither
one of us knew what the fuck

1472
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,530
for 10% of the robberies cause
you were watching sesame street?

1473
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:56,120
Yeah cause all she didn't know what
it was and so I was like it's $10

1474
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:56,730
cool.

1475
01:24:56,730 --> 01:25:01,730
So she gave me $10 for every wallet that
I stole and I fucking would get up on

1476
01:25:02,491 --> 01:25:07,440
Saturday morning and play Pac
man to love fucking sun. Go down.

1477
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:09,720
Well I only did it cause
I wanted to play pac man

1478
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:12,450
that

1479
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:14,880
credible. Yeah. What a crazy inbox.

1480
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:18,810
Now growing up and then getting
past that and looking back on it,

1481
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:23,790
like when you were asking what does
this really happened or am I crazy?

1482
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:27,350
Like how does that feel now when
you tell these stories, you,

1483
01:25:27,351 --> 01:25:28,980
you being this normal person now,

1484
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:33,360
you know it was normal as you can be
having children that are doing great,

1485
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:38,130
living in the suburbs,
staying calm like this.

1486
01:25:38,131 --> 01:25:40,520
This has got to feel like another life.
Right.

1487
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:44,910
It is another lie. Yeah. Wow.

1488
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:49,410
I used to hurt me like it used to like
I would cry when this shit come up and I

1489
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:50,970
was like I'm not doing,
I have,

1490
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:53,580
I have this whole thing in life
and shit don't get me down.

1491
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,280
And I learned that from a fourth
grade teacher cause I, you know,

1492
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:58,020
I used to go to school,
I'll just stanking kid.

1493
01:25:58,021 --> 01:26:00,780
I was a poor kid but I had
a teacher named is true.

1494
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:05,390
That would tell me Patricia get earlier
and I will bring you clean clothes and I

1495
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:06,380
will call them your hair.

1496
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,070
So we were in the bathroom one day and
she just was combing my hair and she said,

1497
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:13,910
I want you to remember that you can be
anything in a rural, you won't to be,

1498
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:18,370
all you gotta do is believe. And I
laid, it just died this year. And I,

1499
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:19,850
when I did time in prison,

1500
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:24,560
anytime I got low or anytime I wanted to
question something that I was trying to

1501
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:28,070
do in life, I went back to
miss truth. Cause she to me,

1502
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,890
she was the first person
to ever believe in me.

1503
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:36,080
And I'm 42 years old and I
still fucking quote Ms. True.

1504
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:37,363
That's crazy.

1505
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:40,820
Isn't it amazing how one person like
that can have an impact to think of those

1506
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:41,900
two people's impacts?

1507
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,970
The One lady that told you your funnel
and then that lady telling me, yeah,

1508
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:49,310
the casework is my God mama now
I still talk to every day. Wow.

1509
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:53,230
Yeah, she was married. She
must be blown away by it.

1510
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:58,380
When I got more than dealt with
this stores like, you know,

1511
01:26:58,381 --> 01:27:01,940
after I tell you all the story,
they'd probably take a month.

1512
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:06,800
You know that people call me.
Can you tell me this story one more time?

1513
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,020
And a lot of time they remind me of Shit.

1514
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:12,410
How many do you write these down?
Do you ever write them down?

1515
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,870
You just confident you're
gonna remember them all.

1516
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:17,680
I do remember mile gas.
Well,

1517
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:20,170
it's like the sex that
you work in all like Nah.

1518
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,210
Talks about my mom and my aunt
and I talk about being married.

1519
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,880
So I really don't need the cripple,
Uncle Jack and d, You know,

1520
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:30,050
right now I tell that story
later on in life on stage.

1521
01:27:30,051 --> 01:27:33,080
I talk about being a drug dealer.
Nothing, you know, just the basic,

1522
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:36,530
just stretching the surface. Right.
You know, cause I'm not a star,

1523
01:27:36,531 --> 01:27:37,580
so it was only so much.

1524
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:40,460
You can put that down before you
make your fucking audience cry.

1525
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:44,210
[inaudible] so you know, when
you, when you become Chris Rock,

1526
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,840
they'll take anything from you.
But I'm going to miss pat fucking nobody.

1527
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:49,550
I got to give it to them either.

1528
01:27:49,551 --> 01:27:53,900
And you got to remember I'm a fucking
black woman talking to a white audience.

1529
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:57,980
Most of my fans are white.
I have no fucking idea.

1530
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,590
I appreciate y'all to the
fullness. Hey, I love the fuck.

1531
01:28:01,591 --> 01:28:05,270
I don't give a fuck if you had one.
I thank you for supporting me.

1532
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:08,960
What do you, what do you think it is
about the audience being all white?

1533
01:28:08,961 --> 01:28:11,840
Like how'd that happen?
I don't know.

1534
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:16,150
Honestly, I don't, I did a radio show
called Bob and Tom and in Annapolis.

1535
01:28:16,151 --> 01:28:19,810
That's why I got a lot of them from,
and they just started coming. I mean,

1536
01:28:19,811 --> 01:28:22,340
I would go into that mainstream club,
you know,

1537
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:26,860
mostly white people and I would tell
these stories and people be like, wow.

1538
01:28:26,861 --> 01:28:29,740
And that's the how people would
be like want to cry. I was like,

1539
01:28:29,741 --> 01:28:33,690
get the fuck away from me. I'm not fucking
crying over this shit. I'm over it. Wow.

1540
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:37,770
It's just because they don't have
anything like that in their life. And you,

1541
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:41,370
I think people like to know
that you overcame, you know,

1542
01:28:41,371 --> 01:28:44,760
I could be on crack like my sister,
my sister been smoking crack from day one.

1543
01:28:44,761 --> 01:28:48,750
She's been on drugs all of life and I
think that's how she dealt with her pain,

1544
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:53,130
a fucking molestation and all that
bullshit that we went through. His keys.

1545
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:56,610
She'll never admit it because she
haven't faced up to the problem yet.

1546
01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:00,610
Well with me, I just pack the shit
in the back of my head. So I think,

1547
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,030
I think when I tell my stories,

1548
01:29:03,150 --> 01:29:06,300
people at home going through whatever
they're going through and they was like,

1549
01:29:06,301 --> 01:29:08,940
fuck,
I thought my problem was big on Hell No.

1550
01:29:08,941 --> 01:29:12,750
This bitch at the pool or cripple uncle's
leg back and help him stick his dick

1551
01:29:12,751 --> 01:29:16,080
in it. Eight. So you realize
your life ain't as bad as you,

1552
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:17,910
I think after you hear my story,

1553
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:22,980
wow. Fuck hey good pants. That's
a feel good story of the year.

1554
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:26,580
I can't even imagine.
Yeah.

1555
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:31,960
So you start 11 years ago, you started
telling this on stage and when,

1556
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:33,730
when you first started doing it,
will you do on it?

1557
01:29:33,731 --> 01:29:34,960
You would do an open mic nights.

1558
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:38,500
When I started talking about my life
about six years ago when I moved to

1559
01:29:38,501 --> 01:29:39,400
Indianapolis.

1560
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:42,080
So six years ago?
Yeah.

1561
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:44,850
So the five years before that you
were doing all black clubs? Yeah.

1562
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,870
All in Atlanta.
And so then you were,

1563
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:51,390
you were more like everyone else around
you just trying to like do whatever

1564
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:55,680
everybody else did try to get laughs.
Yeah. So moving to Indianapolis.

1565
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:57,990
Does that when you started getting
paid work or were you getting paid work

1566
01:29:57,991 --> 01:29:58,824
before that?

1567
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,920
Um, I started getting paid, working in
Annapolis. I became, I became a comedian.

1568
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:07,670
I was bullshitting the whole first
time and my husband used to always say,

1569
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,920
nobody want to hear it,
chicken shit on stage.

1570
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:12,620
And I didn't know what he was talking
about. He was like, it's not funny.

1571
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:15,410
I mean he wouldn't say it to hurt my
feelings, but he said he wouldn't,

1572
01:30:15,411 --> 01:30:19,540
he wouldn't support it. He never would
come see me. He's like that, that,

1573
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,180
that ain't funny. You
know, anybody can talk,

1574
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:24,650
why are you going to talk about your
bedroom on stage? And I was like, oh,

1575
01:30:24,651 --> 01:30:28,370
you just fucking hey.
But when I became Ms Pat,

1576
01:30:28,371 --> 01:30:31,670
who I am today with my life,
he's more supportive.

1577
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:35,090
Like when I say I'm going to do
Joe Rogan Park case, he was like,

1578
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:37,540
here's my credit card,
but before bla,

1579
01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:40,340
I'm not giving you no money to
go tell him fucking roast jokes.

1580
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:46,670
So it makes a difference. Like
he only seen me once. What? Yes,

1581
01:30:46,671 --> 01:30:50,570
once a cat Williams, when I open for
Kat Williams, he invited them out.

1582
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:54,380
That's the only time he's ever seen you.
Cause you know what he said,

1583
01:30:54,430 --> 01:30:59,120
I will never funny to him. I
was always serious. And he say,

1584
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:02,990
people just laughed at what I say. They
thought what? I was trying to be funny,

1585
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:04,340
but I would just being me.

1586
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,870
Wow.
So for him it wasn't funny.

1587
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:13,250
No, because you know what? When I did Bob
and Tom and I talk about being my baby,

1588
01:31:13,251 --> 01:31:17,310
daddy shot me in the head. Another do shot
me in the titty. Uh, his, his coworkers,

1589
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:21,450
there's a you chateau wife Teddy
out. He's like, that was a fucking

1590
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:30,240
ass an abuse. Questions
about me. He's like,

1591
01:31:30,241 --> 01:31:33,390
you snap your wife. What does gay
like, dude, that was not fucking me.

1592
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:37,450
That was the dude before
me. Oh, that is welcome.

1593
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,490
Before I met this dude.
Wow.

1594
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:45,480
It's your nipple like together still
or is it just like God, no, no. Is it,

1595
01:31:45,481 --> 01:31:47,590
is there, it's a little,
some of the damage,

1596
01:31:47,591 --> 01:31:49,990
but it's there and you have
a piece in its store, right?

1597
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,040
You said you were saying no,

1598
01:31:51,070 --> 01:31:54,580
what I was saying when I do my
mammogram and they smashed my boob,

1599
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:59,490
you can see the uh, the gun. What
does it call the gun? The right,

1600
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,020
the

1601
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:03,340
frag me. Oh, my mama
would fragments. Yes. Wow.

1602
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:06,880
Bus. And it looked like breast council,
but they know it's not breast council.

1603
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:10,420
So they have on my chart and my mammogram
off has been shot in the right. Yeah.

1604
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:14,800
Data missing them because I say to them
on your mammogram or whatever, boom, grass

1605
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:20,340
calling a titty. You might want to like,
where's your fucking certificate man?

1606
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:25,700
Where your diploma and almost go.
They always titties Joe always. Yeah.

1607
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:29,990
That's a good name for him. I've got no
problem with that. What do you call them?

1608
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,960
These are great. Okay. I
have a friend who says,

1609
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:36,680
my friend Steve says tds for things
that are good. He's like, ah,

1610
01:32:36,710 --> 01:32:40,820
we're going on a titties, camping
trip. It, I mean it's good. I say tick,

1611
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:44,060
that's tits or the tits boobs.

1612
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:45,490
I don't have boobs.
I got TD,

1613
01:32:45,491 --> 01:32:48,670
my shit and high and he's like balls
and I have to put grease up on them so

1614
01:32:48,671 --> 01:32:52,530
they'll slide across my stomach easily
so they don't fucking create fractures.

1615
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:56,600
She didn't make us soar. Oh No
really? I got real shit. Joe,

1616
01:32:56,930 --> 01:33:00,020
we were talking about your husband before
the podcast started about he became a

1617
01:33:00,021 --> 01:33:04,760
Vegan. Lost a ton of weight last time.
Oh 100 and some pounds. That's crazy.

1618
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:09,920
Yeah, he's, his health was going down. I
mean knees and shit, her and everything.

1619
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:12,290
And he just said,
I'm not eating this shit anymore.

1620
01:33:12,650 --> 01:33:16,490
Well if you're a hundred
pounds overweight, big guy,

1621
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:19,400
he might be God carrying
an extra hundred pounds.

1622
01:33:19,401 --> 01:33:22,460
Like everywhere you go you have to put
a hundred pounds in your shoulders.

1623
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,650
Everything will start
breaking after awhile.

1624
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,050
That's what most people are doing
that are a hundred pounds overweight.

1625
01:33:27,051 --> 01:33:30,410
They just don't think about it. Right?
Yeah. So he got his shit together,

1626
01:33:30,530 --> 01:33:35,370
became a Vegan eating meat in
two years. Wow, that's crazy.

1627
01:33:35,371 --> 01:33:38,780
And did you, do you stick
food in his face? Like smell
this bitch. It don't bother.

1628
01:33:38,781 --> 01:33:40,970
My husband is so fucking strong minded.

1629
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:45,620
This is more for going on a 40 day
water just per water. I was like, oh,

1630
01:33:45,621 --> 01:33:48,650
you fucking crazy.
We can't live on just water.

1631
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:53,340
He drops so much weight just on
water and went to work every day.

1632
01:33:53,370 --> 01:33:56,090
That's crazy. You're not supposed
to do that. That's what I tell him.

1633
01:33:56,270 --> 01:34:01,270
I said stupid fucker on face on youtube
that told him he could live off water.

1634
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:06,720
I was like, look at your fucking
titties. They're fucking just gone.

1635
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:11,910
You need to eat something.
40 days, 40 days of no eat,

1636
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,780
drink juice, nothing. He didn't
even brush his fucking teeth.

1637
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:21,030
He breast and with water supplement.
There's some kind of, no, he didn't.

1638
01:34:23,370 --> 01:34:26,220
Well, let's see. How many days
do you think it says online?

1639
01:34:26,221 --> 01:34:29,320
I'm not saying his story's not true,
but if you can call me,

1640
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:30,720
you know I believe him,

1641
01:34:30,721 --> 01:34:35,160
but I'm saying how many days I did you
think it says online that you could only

1642
01:34:35,161 --> 01:34:38,850
drink water before you die?
I did a 10 day water,

1643
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,430
lemon fast where I couldn't,

1644
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,720
we didn't do no limb and he
didn't write how many days.

1645
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:48,020
I would say you could live to be 30 days
with just water and maybe some stuff,

1646
01:34:48,211 --> 01:34:52,080
but I think it's 21 or you'd be
dead like the last two weeks.

1647
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:53,430
I think that's like this.

1648
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:58,080
Isn't that the story behind
drunkin and afraid or not drunk

1649
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:00,470
and afraid naked in the phrase,
don't they?

1650
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:05,480
Don't they say that like it's 21 days
is the day? Hmm. Okay, let's find out.

1651
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:09,410
Can you live off?
Only water will go to Yahoo answers.

1652
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:14,600
It says the average person could,
depending upon your body fat.

1653
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:19,630
The average person go from a week
to one month or so without food.

1654
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:24,650
So this guy went 40 days.
He liked probably hit the boundaries.

1655
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:29,350
He was so, she was shaking so bad and
I was like, can you please fucking eat?

1656
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:32,290
How are you just going to down me?
I don't even know what a policy yet.

1657
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:36,890
Got it so crazy. He had to do
some kind of supplement. Okay.

1658
01:35:36,891 --> 01:35:38,840
There's a hunger strike Wikipedia page.

1659
01:35:38,841 --> 01:35:42,350
Apparently you could
live as many as 74 days.

1660
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:46,490
That's the longest a person's
ever gone with. Just having water.

1661
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:47,870
Oh my God.

1662
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:51,860
Hunger strikers dying after 52 to 74 days.

1663
01:35:51,861 --> 01:35:55,280
So 74 is a big one.

1664
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:59,360
That's ridiculous. Yeah. Gandhi,

1665
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:03,890
Gandhi apparently went through a
bunch of a hunger strikes when he was,

1666
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:08,900
I didn't know Gandhi was real alive
so young. Oh, so long ago. It was 19,

1667
01:36:08,901 --> 01:36:09,770
22.
Yeah.

1668
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:13,960
Only way I can go on a hunger strike
is they shut down all the chick filets

1669
01:36:16,490 --> 01:36:19,770
did you get mad on Sunday? Why does
chick filet have to be so religious

1670
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:22,860
Sunday? Well, by that
time I don't fucking soak.

1671
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:26,110
All of that crept into my body so much.
I love chick fil A's so much.

1672
01:36:26,111 --> 01:36:29,020
I made my son got his first job
done so we can get a discount.

1673
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:32,780
Wow. It was, um, there's,

1674
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:36,950
there's certain people that are,
uh, that are famous hunger strikers.

1675
01:36:36,951 --> 01:36:41,660
Apparently a guy who fast it to death,
his name is a boy.

1676
01:36:41,690 --> 01:36:45,500
Try and pronounce it as
j a. N. T. I. N. D, a.

1677
01:36:45,501 --> 01:36:48,890
S job Tin dos maybe.
Um,

1678
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:52,250
it was a hundred 16th day of his fast.

1679
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:58,010
They gave up their hunger
strike surpassing the 97
day world record for hunger

1680
01:36:58,011 --> 01:37:00,830
strikes,
which was led by an Irish revolutionary.

1681
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:03,590
So apparently you can fucking do that.

1682
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:07,640
You can not eat for 40 days like your
husband did that. He's crazy though.

1683
01:37:07,641 --> 01:37:09,290
Like he was probably on death's door.

1684
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:12,510
I know. He was so fucking, we ain't,
he went to work and work the eight.

1685
01:37:12,511 --> 01:37:16,120
My husband's deal. Uh, the
transmission for Allison transmission,

1686
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:18,960
that's a crazy way to
decide to lose weight.

1687
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:23,710
I mean, he just wanted to cleanse
his body. You know, what sells,

1688
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:28,050
what do you know? His ski
and turns so pretty. I found

1689
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:34,830
his kid's skin changed,
became super smooth.

1690
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:38,490
How many days in two is fat? I didn't
really, cause I've, you know, I traveled,

1691
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:41,640
I tried when I was, at that time I
was traveling a lot. So you know,

1692
01:37:41,641 --> 01:37:44,580
I come home and I was like, Goddamn,
you losing a lot of weight, dude.

1693
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:47,850
They're not fighting you on a fucking
wall. I was like, you need to fucking eat.

1694
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:51,370
Yeah. What, did he ever get to a point
where you're worried about him falling?

1695
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:55,860
Yeah. No, not really falling asleep
driving and I was worried him fucking,

1696
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,670
he was always cold, so I was
like, you call you back to die.

1697
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:03,150
What the fuck are you on? Leave me here.
Would he chills? I got to do gates.

1698
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:06,180
Wow.

1699
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:10,470
So then when after 40 days you start to
eat and he starts eating and what did he,

1700
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:15,460
he uh, he started to like
fruit. He went into fruit first.

1701
01:38:15,461 --> 01:38:18,950
Just real gentle. Yeah. Gotta be
a big shock to your system. Yeah,

1702
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,030
that's what he said.
He didn't want to shock his system.

1703
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,720
He does this shit all the time. He
don't get go that long. And I'm like,

1704
01:38:23,721 --> 01:38:27,150
am I can go 20 days, 15 days. Really?

1705
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:30,710
I've heard of people doing like
six days of juice. That's it.

1706
01:38:30,711 --> 01:38:33,720
Want me to call him and ask? No,
I've listen. I'm not questioning.

1707
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:37,170
I'm saying I don't know anybody who's
ever done that very extreme dude.

1708
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:40,380
He just liked it when he,
when he just, I tell you,

1709
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:45,381
he used to smoke cigarettes and nobody
knows this and he just stopped and he

1710
01:38:45,781 --> 01:38:48,240
started may one time when I got arrested,

1711
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:51,390
he went to court with me when I was
getting my life together and I needed my

1712
01:38:51,391 --> 01:38:53,310
driver's license and to just say,

1713
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:57,030
you have $5,000 worth of traffic tickets,

1714
01:38:57,930 --> 01:39:00,450
how you want to paint it. And
so my head was like, your honor,

1715
01:39:00,451 --> 01:39:04,770
I can only get $500 out at
one, you know, during the day.

1716
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,380
That's it. He said, well
you gotta go get some money.

1717
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:08,760
We're going to lock her ass up.

1718
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:12,660
He started back smoking cause
he never been to jail. Wow.

1719
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:18,330
That's the hardest one. Probably quitting
smoking. No, he went cold Turkey.

1720
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:22,560
He and after I got out of jail he stopped.
He did it again by the week.

1721
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:25,890
He always do every fucking
thing called tick Joe.

1722
01:39:25,891 --> 01:39:30,300
I've been trying to lose weight forever.
I've tried all the nice shit out there.

1723
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:32,700
Nutrisystem did work,
but I can't afford the shit.

1724
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:36,510
So now I'm back at my ex like diet
cause that's really cheap. Excellent,

1725
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,970
excellent.
Take it and shit your brains

1726
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:47,070
and he gets mad at me cause I do excellent
and I'd get mad at him cause he do

1727
01:39:47,071 --> 01:39:51,300
water. I think x lacks is
probably worse for you than water.

1728
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:56,510
I know I do the mouth phone the mile
for but I mean all that's stuff is a

1729
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:02,160
diuretic, right? I mean what does it
do? It makes me shit. I've pounds.

1730
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:03,720
Like if I could eat a cheeseburger,

1731
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:05,800
I really want to get rid
of this cheeseburger.

1732
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:13,620
Is the based diet a way to do it?

1733
01:40:13,850 --> 01:40:17,110
I know Joe was sometime I
can't resist chick filet.

1734
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:22,230
I like coffee and I really can't drink
coffee because I got sensitive nipples.

1735
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:25,720
Coffee make my nipples
really sore and I'm most,

1736
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:30,120
I'm seriously nipple.
Caffeine fucks my breasts up.

1737
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:33,540
I got caffeine breath, some called
caffeine breath and women's out there.

1738
01:40:33,541 --> 01:40:37,260
Who's listening? They know. I'm telling
the truth is a common term. Yes.

1739
01:40:37,261 --> 01:40:40,440
When you drink too much caffeine
it fucks with your titties.

1740
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:44,310
So I just went and had a mammogram.
I'm just my left titty two weeks ago.

1741
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:48,660
Wow. Because I had too much caffeine.
So when I lay off the caffeine,

1742
01:40:48,661 --> 01:40:49,920
my breast stop being so,

1743
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:54,180
but I like chick filet
called fibro breasts. That's

1744
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:58,410
what it's called. That's the medical
term. Yeah. Fibrosis stick guests. Jamie,

1745
01:40:58,411 --> 01:41:03,130
you googling everything constantly.
I'm constantly curious.

1746
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:07,870
Yeah. Pain or discomfort in both breasts.
Pain comes and goes with the period,

1747
01:41:07,871 --> 01:41:12,340
but can last through the entire month.
Breasts feel full, swollen and heavy.

1748
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:13,310
Yeah.

1749
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:15,510
And Caffeine does until my breasts.
Well,

1750
01:41:15,511 --> 01:41:19,920
my nipples are hard to sit in a bra of
the wrapper mint at the wrapping and

1751
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:24,620
tissue paypal. Wow, that's crazy. But
coffee fucks me up. But I love it.

1752
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,280
Some women get it from eating chocolate.

1753
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:31,150
You drinking caffeine or eating high fat
foods that causes their symptoms. Uh,

1754
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:33,300
but according to this medical page,

1755
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:36,300
there's no clear proof
of what's causing it.

1756
01:41:37,290 --> 01:41:39,500
When I come off of caffeine,

1757
01:41:39,570 --> 01:41:44,240
my titty stopped being so honestly I
know my titties. Well, it makes sense.

1758
01:41:44,241 --> 01:41:48,410
Fibro, cystic breasts, the breast,
and that's what it's called. Painful,

1759
01:41:48,411 --> 01:41:52,040
lumpy breasts as lump. And it almost
make you feel like you got, you know,

1760
01:41:52,041 --> 01:41:55,220
like you feel alone.
So I went in two weeks ago and I was like,

1761
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:59,270
I'm very paranoid cause breast cancer
run in my family. So on my daddy's side.

1762
01:41:59,271 --> 01:42:02,060
So I was like, just check my
damn titty. So my doctor know,

1763
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:08,090
I said if I could take of my doctor,
I fucking love my doctor.

1764
01:42:08,091 --> 01:42:10,460
Like well he'd given me a
gynecology visit. I'd be like,

1765
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:12,860
how did this blue cross
blue shield pussy look. Dot.

1766
01:42:17,050 --> 01:42:20,000
Oh they gave me a mammogram on
one breast and they're like,

1767
01:42:20,001 --> 01:42:22,490
you don't have any fucking lounge.
Lay off the damn coffee.

1768
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:25,730
Oh, that's all it is. That's,
that's fascinating. That's amazing.

1769
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:29,830
Is there anything that does that to
your dark fiber cystic Dick Cells.

1770
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:35,260
And when you're a woman and you turn
about 40 your body is like a 64 Chevy you

1771
01:42:35,261 --> 01:42:39,160
must repair to in bitch. Like honestly,
since we're friends now, I tell you,

1772
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:43,090
so when I turned 40 my cycle came on,
one day wouldn't go off.

1773
01:42:43,091 --> 01:42:45,850
So I had to go in now and they go,
I don't know the medical term,

1774
01:42:45,851 --> 01:42:47,860
but I know you're going to,
I know you're going to Google it.

1775
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:52,060
They have to burn the inside
of your vagina. Oh good Lord.

1776
01:42:52,110 --> 01:42:54,040
They burnt my vagina,
Joe.

1777
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:58,660
And they would beat box and for like
three weeks it was uh, it didn't hurt.

1778
01:42:58,690 --> 01:43:01,600
It was but woo woo woo boot. So
I called my doctor, I was like,

1779
01:43:01,810 --> 01:43:05,730
my pussy is singing.
Can you stop my pussy from saying it?

1780
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:10,270
So it was like air or no, it was
healing. It was healing. Yes.

1781
01:43:10,271 --> 01:43:14,320
So in the healing it was popping and it
was, it sounded like it was making music.

1782
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:18,940
What kind of healing was going on there?
I don't know, but it was like boom, boom,

1783
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:22,770
boom. I could almost feel it in my
stomach and my doctor, no, I'm a comedian.

1784
01:43:22,771 --> 01:43:25,090
And I was like, I'm serious
dotting my puzzles, beat boxing.

1785
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,980
So I go up there and
he said it was healing.

1786
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:31,190
So essentially they had a cauterized,
is that the term? Something like that.

1787
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:33,770
So you were bleeding so much
that they had to go in there.

1788
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:34,710
They need to do two things.

1789
01:43:34,711 --> 01:43:37,670
They either burn it inside of you
or they give you a hit director.

1790
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:38,910
Me and I didn't want to history,

1791
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:42,120
so there was no other way to
stop the bleeding. No good.

1792
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:44,460
It just break down

1793
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:50,850
too crazy feeling that they burnt the
inside of you to cool everything off.

1794
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:55,900
We had to stop the flow.
Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah.

1795
01:43:56,700 --> 01:44:01,660
God, this extra up things that women
have to worry about. Breast cancers.

1796
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:04,460
One, like they say dudes get breast
cancer, but you know, I'm like,

1797
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:08,470
oh y'all gotta worry about is dropped
penises that said, and then they, yeah,

1798
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,360
south wieners.

1799
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:12,430
Hmm. Yeah, but they fixed stat. They have.

1800
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:17,050
Yeah, but they don't have anything
for broken titties and fucking vagina,

1801
01:44:17,530 --> 01:44:19,620
you know,
dry ass holes.

1802
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:25,080
I know people, uh, people get
their vaginas tightened up.

1803
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:29,760
I've heard that's unbelievably painful
though. Really go in there and fucking,

1804
01:44:29,761 --> 01:44:33,170
you know, a woman's had a few kids and
their vagina all blown out. They'll,

1805
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:37,520
it doesn't blow it out. It's still got
some grip. You gotta use your on the Elmo.

1806
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:40,660
Depends on the woman this,
I know what you're saying,

1807
01:44:40,661 --> 01:44:44,990
but there's realities about the shape of
the body, like about like stretch marks.

1808
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,220
A lot of that's genetic. Some people
get stretch marks on people do not,

1809
01:44:48,790 --> 01:44:52,240
they don't have any dish. No,
probably got just crazy genes.

1810
01:44:52,450 --> 01:44:55,930
Some people they stretch way the fuck
out and have a kid and it all goes right

1811
01:44:55,931 --> 01:44:58,570
back into place. It's
amazing. And then some people,

1812
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:03,010
one kid and they're Donesville the whole
thing. The whole package is just done.

1813
01:45:03,650 --> 01:45:06,070
Like someone just drove
a truck through a water

1814
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:08,240
mine. My daughter in law
is like that. I was like,

1815
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:13,040
don't have a baby because this baby
is gonna fuck up your finger. I said,

1816
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:15,660
you young girls need to stop
fucking trying to be mamas.

1817
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:18,330
Take your body and abused them.
How Fun.

1818
01:45:18,510 --> 01:45:22,380
Have a baby when you fucking in your
late thirties before about the drought.

1819
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:25,650
Don't give them an opportunity
to fuck up your flat stomach.

1820
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,600
But what if she wants a baby more than

1821
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:36,770
a lot of shame and she's still trying to
wear that sexy shit. And I'm like, ah,

1822
01:45:36,771 --> 01:45:41,150
no booboo, take them home is not going
to work. You miss your opportunity.

1823
01:45:41,151 --> 01:45:43,080
I told you I don't let my fucking son

1824
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:47,970
pregnant. No booboo take you.
Take that whole shit off.

1825
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:53,410
Oh see I told you not to let my son get
you pregnant. Holy Shit. That's funny.

1826
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:58,900
There was a thing in the news the other
day were ages 18 to 24 are twice as

1827
01:45:59,930 --> 01:46:02,780
likely to get vaginal
surgery than most women.

1828
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:06,560
I guess it's really popular with the
young kids now to get the Barbie cut where

1829
01:46:06,561 --> 01:46:09,770
they chop off all the lips and everything.
So it's just the line,

1830
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:13,050
you know like kind of like
surgery you mean? Yeah. Yeah.

1831
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:17,090
To make you look less pussy.

1832
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:20,950
It's, it's the porn that people
were trying to get the porn look,

1833
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:24,910
you know like the perfect, that must
be exactly what is key is up crazy.

1834
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:30,600
Everybody wanted daily what is vagina
lips call Labia Lavia everybody

1835
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:34,910
read it.
I never say it

1836
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:39,860
was going to kiss the stuff
that's coming out of it.

1837
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:44,390
The gentleman out of it to catch an APP.

1838
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:48,220
They have files but it's got to like
run down the sides. Meet curtains.

1839
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:50,520
Yeah.

1840
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:53,370
I don't know.
I think it is pornography though.

1841
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:58,580
Cause you think about like pornography
is so it's so bright and visual.

1842
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:01,980
You know like if you got a camera and
you're, if you're having sex with someone,

1843
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:05,490
you know there's a lot of stuff
going on, right? There's a,

1844
01:47:05,790 --> 01:47:09,160
their faces in your face kiss in,
you're touching each other.

1845
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,220
But if you're watching a porn,

1846
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:14,340
a lot of times it just showing
you like the insertion.

1847
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:17,610
The show knew the Dick and the vagina
and the showing you the body parts is

1848
01:47:17,611 --> 01:47:21,960
showing you things moving and you're
concentrating on like this one particular

1849
01:47:21,961 --> 01:47:25,980
area and you could decide for
whatever reason like that that is,

1850
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:29,760
that's what you got to focus on. Like
that needed to trim up your fucking yard.

1851
01:47:29,970 --> 01:47:32,430
He could clean your hedges.
So it looks like these videos.

1852
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:37,050
Well you know a Joe, I got stomach
was sitting on my vagina is seen.

1853
01:47:37,051 --> 01:47:42,020
Is this the nineties maybe. I don't
know what's going on. Maybe I need some,

1854
01:47:42,021 --> 01:47:44,010
what is it called? Batman. Pussy too.

1855
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:52,040
Yeah. I don't think you need
it. No, I don't need a job.
I mean nobody needs that.

1856
01:47:52,041 --> 01:47:52,874
Don't do that.

1857
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:55,410
Plus some guys like it,
like Jim Norton,

1858
01:47:55,411 --> 01:47:57,450
he's always talking about
he loves big Pussy Lips.

1859
01:47:57,451 --> 01:48:01,890
It drives him crazy that when we get that
fixed and some some famous porn star,

1860
01:48:01,891 --> 01:48:06,000
I think her name was Houston.
She did something with her Vagina Lips.

1861
01:48:06,001 --> 01:48:07,710
Like she sold him or something like that.

1862
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:10,200
Sally goofy that,
yeah,

1863
01:48:10,201 --> 01:48:13,110
there was something crazy cause I'm
trying to remember the story. She,

1864
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:16,350
I think she got surgery then
she did something with it.

1865
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:18,970
She was also one of the first
people to ever do a gang bang.

1866
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:21,750
You remember still like the Houston.
We saw that.

1867
01:48:21,751 --> 01:48:26,150
She didn't hear it all the time when
crack first came out. Joe, come on Dad.

1868
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:30,780
I mean in a porn again,
pay oh one of those giant ones.

1869
01:48:30,781 --> 01:48:34,970
Like 500 people like yeah,
she had 500 people have seen

1870
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:37,190
this is the thing.
They say it's 500 people,

1871
01:48:37,191 --> 01:48:40,880
but it's really like 60 people and they
fuck her a bunch of times. They're like,

1872
01:48:40,881 --> 01:48:44,570
go through the line and they keep going
and you know, they act like a new guy.

1873
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:46,700
I think some of them have actually gone.

1874
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:53,690
I'm not into Poland. No, it was
Houston. She sold her labia for $50,000

1875
01:48:57,610 --> 01:49:00,530
like a silky blanket. What do
you, how long will it last?

1876
01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:03,710
$50,000 how long has it good for?
So then it's freezer somewhere.

1877
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:08,750
He's probably had it dried out.
It's like he's like eating beef Jerky,

1878
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:14,120
beef jerky for job. I need to call him.
Tell my daughter that she might like that.

1879
01:49:14,490 --> 01:49:17,250
Is there a I needed to,
she might like beef jerky.

1880
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:21,770
Is there a photo of Said Lavia? No, I
don't want to see no sub labor. Yes.

1881
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:27,980
I just don't understand. Is there a
before and after picture of her pussy?

1882
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:30,500
If there's not,
that's reportedly,

1883
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:36,170
yeah, I'm more for the women's of
trying to keep dales and you know,

1884
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:41,510
I'm just one of vagina jacket. Just I
don't understand. I, it's gotta be that.

1885
01:49:41,511 --> 01:49:44,150
It's gotta be the porn. It's
gotta be, it's gotta be, I mean,

1886
01:49:44,151 --> 01:49:47,980
think about fake breasts. Fake breasts
are. So, you know what the other thing, I

1887
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,710
was at a,
I did k rock the other day and um,

1888
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:55,210
they brought up Korean women who
when the, uh, like Miss Korea,

1889
01:49:55,660 --> 01:50:00,400
you know Miss Korea, they look
exactly the same. Like pull up,

1890
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:03,820
pull up, there's a v image. Oh No, no.

1891
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,250
This is way crazy cause it's
all about plastic surgery.

1892
01:50:06,251 --> 01:50:10,270
They get a very specific type of look by
plastic surgery and it's super, super,

1893
01:50:10,271 --> 01:50:14,950
super common amongst Korean, all
of them. But that's what's crazy.

1894
01:50:14,951 --> 01:50:18,710
It doesn't make any sense because they
look exactly the same. So over the years,

1895
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:18,881
like,

1896
01:50:18,881 --> 01:50:23,200
so how I think of how many look at this
plastic surgery blame for making all

1897
01:50:23,201 --> 01:50:26,620
Miss Korea contestants look alike.
Look at what these women look like.

1898
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:28,870
They look exactly the same.

1899
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:33,910
Like you could have photos of any one of
them doing something and then tell the

1900
01:50:33,911 --> 01:50:38,200
police and charged charge for the crime.
I mean, look at what they look like.

1901
01:50:38,201 --> 01:50:41,860
I mean, I don't like generalizations.
You say, oh, everybody looks the same.

1902
01:50:41,861 --> 01:50:46,420
Well maybe to you you're racist. Fuck
No. Those girls look exactly the same.

1903
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:51,400
And what they're doing is apparently
they're going and getting a very specific

1904
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:56,230
type of surgery. Uh, and they shaped
their face to a very specific way.

1905
01:50:56,530 --> 01:50:59,830
And they do it with their chins and they
do it with their eyes and they do it

1906
01:50:59,831 --> 01:51:03,010
with their noses. And when it's all
said and done, what I did from there,

1907
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:07,780
very close. At least very close. I mean
really close when it's all said and done.

1908
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:10,540
Their oldest. Exactly what site
that, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1909
01:51:10,541 --> 01:51:14,290
There's a lot of before and afters.
This is a real common problem.

1910
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:17,990
Why wouldn't say common? I
wouldn't say a problem. Rather. Oh,

1911
01:51:17,991 --> 01:51:22,480
it's a cultural issue in Korea.
They're plastic surgery has run rampant.

1912
01:51:22,630 --> 01:51:24,460
Cause if you don't want to
have sex with your wife,

1913
01:51:24,461 --> 01:51:25,750
you sit in one of them over there.

1914
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:29,530
And when was, I mean, oh, so if you
won't want to have sex with your husband,

1915
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:32,500
yeah, your husband was here would be
exactly like he looked just like that.

1916
01:51:32,501 --> 01:51:34,060
Just seeing your husband.
Does he have any,

1917
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:37,290
why don't you go out with your boyfriend?
And he sticks it in there and he re

1918
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:38,910
realize it's like this one's tied,

1919
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:42,850
this one's got that extra work done
down there and no means don't know.

1920
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:47,890
This is not my wife was going on here
unless he thinks that she had something

1921
01:51:48,181 --> 01:51:52,260
done. But it's just a, it's a very strange
that they're all adopting this uniform.

1922
01:51:52,261 --> 01:51:55,600
Look, that's scary to me.
You know, that's a scary, uh,

1923
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:58,420
there's before and after of wine.
You could still look at this.

1924
01:51:58,810 --> 01:52:01,260
She looks very actually fuck.
She needed,

1925
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:06,310
they should do that.
Joe,

1926
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:11,680
if you could tell him the big,
the big thing that they're getting is the,

1927
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:15,270
what's been quoted as the anime.
I, if you look at the eyes,

1928
01:52:15,271 --> 01:52:19,060
they're very big and very, you know,
there's kind of stretched odis stress.

1929
01:52:19,061 --> 01:52:19,894
They are though,

1930
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:24,950
they cut the Lids, they changed the lids.
They changed the shape of the lid. They,

1931
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:27,820
they'd go in there and
they take too much pie,

1932
01:52:27,821 --> 01:52:30,640
slice out and pull that bitch
together and their eyes are like this.

1933
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:33,670
That's what they do to people
when they get older too.

1934
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:35,800
I know a dude who did that as eyes done,

1935
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,900
like to get your eyes done and
all of sudden you're like this.

1936
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:39,460
There's nothing like Clo.

1937
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:43,290
A dude looking like a old ass woman
with plastic surgery isn't here.

1938
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:46,340
Kenny Rogers. Have you seen
him lately? It is the creepiest

1939
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:50,090
thing ever. He's like on a
commercial right now. Anything.
Kenny Rogers, terrifying.

1940
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:55,160
Kenny Rogers is. Yeah. Well, do you
ever see when he looks like now?

1941
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:58,940
No. Yeah. Let me think. You would
recognize him? Yeah. Poor guy.

1942
01:52:58,970 --> 01:53:01,880
He's pretty open about it. I think you
said conversations about or talked about.

1943
01:53:01,890 --> 01:53:04,040
I fucked up shit.
I mean,

1944
01:53:04,041 --> 01:53:07,100
you kind of have to talk about how you
fucked up when you look like this because

1945
01:53:07,101 --> 01:53:10,640
it's so obvious what Joan
Rivers had a lot of it. Yeah.

1946
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:14,210
That's not a bad picture dude. In
that picture. He kind of looks normal,

1947
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:16,940
but there's the pull it. That's a
bad picture. That's a bad picture.

1948
01:53:16,941 --> 01:53:20,090
Could get get a good one because there's
some good ones that are like really

1949
01:53:20,091 --> 01:53:22,190
shocking.
Just pull up Kenny Rogers,

1950
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,830
bad plastic surgery and
you'll get some good ones.

1951
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:29,750
I was on the beach the other day and
this dude caught a, a, a mantra rang,

1952
01:53:29,751 --> 01:53:34,220
you know what a Manta Ray is and he pulls
it in from the water and uh, there's,

1953
01:53:34,430 --> 01:53:37,190
it's in Malibu and it's all these rich
people that have houses there and they

1954
01:53:37,191 --> 01:53:40,450
think they can tell people what
to do for whatever reason. So, uh,

1955
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:43,460
the dude had already released the Manta,
he caught it and released it. You know,

1956
01:53:43,461 --> 01:53:46,790
they were trying to catch fish and they
just caught this manta ray accidentally.

1957
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:50,420
And so he, uh, he's releasing
it and this lady comes running.

1958
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:53,150
Cause this other lady was like,
you know, they're doing this,

1959
01:53:53,151 --> 01:53:54,350
they're torturing that animal.

1960
01:53:54,351 --> 01:53:57,470
They pulled it out of the ocean and this
chick comes running to tell them what

1961
01:53:57,471 --> 01:54:00,170
to do. And when I tell you
that she looked like a monster,

1962
01:54:00,171 --> 01:54:04,970
like I am not exactly what she looked
like a monster. I mean this poor lady,

1963
01:54:05,090 --> 01:54:08,510
I felt bad.
Like she had done so much to herself.

1964
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:12,610
It was like her face had been so pulled
back and the guys who are listening or

1965
01:54:12,650 --> 01:54:15,290
podcast fans,
the guys who caught the fish,

1966
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:17,340
so they're probably listening
to it right now. They,

1967
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:21,590
they were talking to me before.
So I assume if you know who you are,

1968
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:26,090
what's up nice guys. Um, you
know, regular looking young,

1969
01:54:26,091 --> 01:54:29,070
tattooed up dudes who were out there
fishing and they caught this big ass man

1970
01:54:29,071 --> 01:54:32,780
array. But this lady came running and
when I saw her as she approached him,

1971
01:54:32,781 --> 01:54:36,140
I had a visual, I mean a
uh, like a visual visible.

1972
01:54:36,141 --> 01:54:39,650
Like I felt an a tangible like quiver.

1973
01:54:40,210 --> 01:54:43,160
Like I saw her,
I made the visual contact,

1974
01:54:43,161 --> 01:54:47,450
like my eyes hit her face and was like,
oh my whole fucked up here.

1975
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:49,370
But did you do,
and not only that,

1976
01:54:49,371 --> 01:54:54,290
she's in this crazy ass fucking
multimillion dollar beach house. You know,

1977
01:54:54,291 --> 01:54:54,950
this,

1978
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:59,950
those beach houses in Malibu or
ridiculous chicken was somebody who adds,

1979
01:54:59,961 --> 01:55:03,860
is not wide open wide. He's sleep.
He's probably just Xanax the fuck out.

1980
01:55:03,861 --> 01:55:07,190
Just trying to deal with her
and him and his own life.

1981
01:55:07,190 --> 01:55:10,190
He's a probably a mess too.
I don't know who he was or who she was,

1982
01:55:10,191 --> 01:55:14,420
but it was the arrogance of this crazy
lady running up these guys. She was guys,

1983
01:55:14,421 --> 01:55:16,130
throw it back,
throw it back.

1984
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:19,250
Like you could keep a manta ray
and eat it if you want it to.

1985
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:23,030
Nobody can stop you. And it's like you'd
beat look out there. That's the ocean.

1986
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:24,680
Like that's a really fucking big,

1987
01:55:25,060 --> 01:55:29,510
it's idea that you'll have this guy on
the side of is going to do anything to

1988
01:55:29,511 --> 01:55:32,900
the population of the Manta rays.
Like that's not how animals die.

1989
01:55:32,901 --> 01:55:37,640
They die because of giant nets that they
pull amongst these huge boats and they,

1990
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:40,670
they pulled them out of it.
That's what's over pop over fishing.

1991
01:55:40,671 --> 01:55:45,150
It's not a dude on the rocks pulling
some, but in her idea was that, you know,

1992
01:55:45,151 --> 01:55:49,080
in her mind she was going to tell this
dude with a mentor, but I felt so bad.

1993
01:55:49,170 --> 01:55:53,490
Manners are cute that they're
kind of different and unique
species. I I, oh yeah,

1994
01:55:53,491 --> 01:55:56,010
they're kind of cool. Yeah. But
you know, you, you ever had skate,

1995
01:55:56,670 --> 01:56:01,020
like get a restaurant. It's
delicious. What is skate?
Skate is a, it's a Manta Ray.

1996
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:05,030
It's a type of rent. Wasn't that one that
was not the one that he caught. He got,

1997
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:08,550
he was like a sting ray and had like one,
I don't know what kind of ran it was.

1998
01:56:08,790 --> 01:56:10,830
It was cool looking, but he
right. He let it go immediately.

1999
01:56:10,831 --> 01:56:12,960
He had already let it go when
this lady came running over,

2000
01:56:13,410 --> 01:56:17,730
but she just had such a monster
face that type monster faces,

2001
01:56:17,731 --> 01:56:20,550
so it's going to take this Manta
Ray and beat the hell out of you.

2002
01:56:20,551 --> 01:56:23,910
If you don't get on this beats,
they lose share face up.

2003
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:28,320
They'd call the police so
fast. They probably have, I
don't know how they do it,

2004
01:56:28,321 --> 01:56:32,690
but you know like this Kenny
Rogers. That's a good, bad
picture of him. It's bad.

2005
01:56:33,330 --> 01:56:37,860
The one on the right, his eyes and his
nose is, he looks like he's high as fuck.

2006
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:41,550
He might be in California.
That's not a good one though.

2007
01:56:41,551 --> 01:56:45,000
There's some other ones where it just
looks really awful. Whether there's other,

2008
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:49,560
I've seen a one comparison. This one's
a good one too. Maybe. Yeah, that's it.

2009
01:56:49,561 --> 01:56:50,394
That's it.
That's it.

2010
01:56:50,490 --> 01:56:51,810
Holy Fuck.
He like

2011
01:56:54,230 --> 01:56:57,340
that cannot be no Kenny
Rogers. It is. It is.

2012
01:56:57,910 --> 01:56:58,743
No,
that's him.

2013
01:56:58,750 --> 01:57:03,750
It changed the shape of his face and
it doesn't make you look better either.

2014
01:57:03,931 --> 01:57:08,660
It just makes you look different and not
in a good different, his eyes as wide.

2015
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:11,800
You can't shoot that shit
in your face either. Man.

2016
01:57:11,980 --> 01:57:13,180
That thing that everyone's doing,

2017
01:57:13,181 --> 01:57:15,840
what they're putting filler in
their face and not just boating.

2018
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:19,470
The black girls are putting
it in as they putting, uh, uh,

2019
01:57:19,490 --> 01:57:22,160
so many trends ginger's have died.

2020
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:27,440
I'm serious stuff and things and there
was no, you haven't heard about it.

2021
01:57:27,450 --> 01:57:30,770
Google it. They was taking, people was
telling me he was giving them but shots,

2022
01:57:30,890 --> 01:57:35,660
but it was putting fucking corn,
oil, corn oil and the heirs. I know,

2023
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:38,600
I know so many black
girls with fake booties.

2024
01:57:41,450 --> 01:57:44,540
That's a photo with some captions on
it. Yeah. When that shit harden up,

2025
01:57:44,541 --> 01:57:48,280
ain't nothing they can do with that crowd.
They can't go in and cut it out. No.

2026
01:57:49,310 --> 01:57:51,560
I don't know. I don't, I
wouldn't let nobody shoot. No,

2027
01:57:51,620 --> 01:57:53,720
no fucking home depot stuff and my booty

2028
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:57,730
lips done back in the day are there.
There were scarred for life.

2029
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:01,630
There's this poor lady that used to live
down the street from me and she had a,

2030
01:58:01,690 --> 01:58:06,310
like she talked to you and she had a
line like right here from here to here,

2031
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:11,550
a straight line inside her lips from
where she had these artificial lips put in

2032
01:58:13,121 --> 01:58:17,800
and so when would talk to you
like the scar on her upper lip?

2033
01:58:17,801 --> 01:58:22,200
It was so distracting. It was like, what
did you do? You just see probably got it.

2034
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:26,140
Lips like years, she won a
natural ones. Couldn't get it.

2035
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:29,060
I always get compliments on
my lips. Yeah, Beautiful Lips.

2036
01:58:31,910 --> 01:58:35,920
Wait a minute.
They're beautiful.

2037
01:58:36,870 --> 01:58:40,910
Women want, they want those plump
juicy lips. You know, white women,

2038
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:42,700
they'll go drastic measures

2039
01:58:43,230 --> 01:58:47,730
and I won't be as is now. Yeah,
they're getting them to weird.

2040
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:52,780
Yeah. Should I show botched,
botched or it's all plastics.

2041
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:54,990
I was watching one last night
where the woman got the,

2042
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:57,240
the fake bud and it started to,

2043
01:58:57,250 --> 01:59:00,740
it popped or something like that and
started going into her leg and her inner

2044
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:04,740
and stuff and they couldn't get it out
because it started growing with the

2045
01:59:04,741 --> 01:59:08,340
muscles and start attaching the muscles
so that they couldn't take it out and so

2046
01:59:08,341 --> 01:59:12,210
she just decided to get another one put
in there and then that one didn't take

2047
01:59:12,211 --> 01:59:16,120
because there was a, it was just all
fucked up a button plants and then,

2048
01:59:16,170 --> 01:59:19,290
then she could just flip them like she
would sit down and would flip it upside

2049
01:59:19,291 --> 01:59:20,720
down and stuff like that.
Okay.

2050
01:59:20,790 --> 01:59:24,510
Reversal. I saw it on, on
Facebook. I saw that lady,

2051
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:27,990
she's just her as inside out and
it was a bad job and I was like,

2052
01:59:28,170 --> 01:59:31,650
as long as long as the ass is sticking,
the right way is not a bad job.

2053
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:36,270
It was like a little flyer. How lower
your standards? Yeah, no, it's a bad job.

2054
01:59:36,510 --> 01:59:40,020
If you can flip it around. What have
you, a spokesperson for the surgery?

2055
01:59:40,770 --> 01:59:43,780
I don't know. I'm able when it
was turned the right way to ask.

2056
01:59:43,781 --> 01:59:46,470
It was nice and curvy when
it flipped over there,

2057
01:59:46,490 --> 01:59:48,990
like a plate there was
upside down and I asked,

2058
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:51,380
could you imagine what it feels
like if he grabbed that thing?

2059
01:59:51,410 --> 01:59:53,720
Like you're wrestling with something
and it's like a fish is underneath the

2060
01:59:53,721 --> 01:59:54,380
surface.

2061
01:59:54,380 --> 01:59:56,670
It can't be no different
than sucking fate.

2062
01:59:56,750 --> 02:00:00,580
Geez. I gotta grab a cost by
at a strip club in Dayton,

2063
02:00:00,581 --> 02:00:03,910
Ohio and it felt just like
boobs on your butt by hers.

2064
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:07,870
She got the really big ones that went
over like size of basketballs and so it

2065
02:00:07,871 --> 02:00:10,510
was just like jelly. Very Jelly. Ah, yeah.

2066
02:00:10,650 --> 02:00:14,640
Yeah. She probably went too
far. Yeah. That's what happens.
Everybody goes too far.

2067
02:00:14,830 --> 02:00:18,480
That's like some women can get breast
jobs and they just get a little,

2068
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:21,690
a little bit of an enlargement
and it looks great. Yeah.

2069
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:24,930
And then other women get crazy and they
get those basketballs put in and you're

2070
02:00:24,931 --> 02:00:25,764
like,
oh,

2071
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:28,910
and you may have back problems
and they look stupid. It's stupid.

2072
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,260
And they look Cleveland Sag. I'm
just going to keep it. What I got.

2073
02:00:33,261 --> 02:00:35,110
I'm going to keep the same man show.

2074
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:40,100
I don't have time to be putting cutting
off my Libra yields. John Lilly. Oh,

2075
02:00:40,101 --> 02:00:42,380
your skin lift,
whatever you want to call it.

2076
02:00:42,590 --> 02:00:44,390
Cause that stuff going to dry your vagina.

2077
02:00:44,391 --> 02:00:48,760
You never going to have wet vagina
without having those lips. You dumb half.

2078
02:00:48,761 --> 02:00:50,750
Is that how it works?
So the lips like help.

2079
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:54,020
What helps keeps the marsh was in there.
Moisture in the air.

2080
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:57,050
We want to keep the shit,
wait. I'm learning a lot.

2081
02:00:58,010 --> 02:01:00,980
It's a lot of things I didn't
know. Yes. Um, I can't do all that.

2082
02:01:00,981 --> 02:01:03,740
I don't want to pull my neck
back. My eyes bet. I mean,

2083
02:01:03,741 --> 02:01:06,860
you know you're going to get old
shit is going to stop working.

2084
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:10,190
That's why God gave you hand when
my husband ain't working no more.

2085
02:01:10,191 --> 02:01:12,530
I just unstick his balls
and we keep it moving.

2086
02:01:12,860 --> 02:01:15,230
We watched the news and go to
bed. You know what I mean? I

2087
02:01:15,230 --> 02:01:19,220
think, I think that also when people
are doing, they're early adopters,

2088
02:01:19,340 --> 02:01:20,173
you know what I'm saying?

2089
02:01:20,210 --> 02:01:24,530
Like the people that got the original
boob jobs like those they leaked and

2090
02:01:24,531 --> 02:01:26,150
there's silicone and the,

2091
02:01:26,151 --> 02:01:29,660
you know the poor people got sick and I
remember how many people got like Lupus

2092
02:01:29,661 --> 02:01:33,080
and all of these diseases from tick. I
knew a girl got lupus from her breast job,

2093
02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:35,660
she had a leaky breast
job and she got lupus.

2094
02:01:35,661 --> 02:01:38,270
Like she was all fucked up
or immune system was jacked,

2095
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:43,400
but like they have a down where like,
you know, it's very few reactions.

2096
02:01:43,401 --> 02:01:45,620
It's a different feel to it.
Like you were talking about,

2097
02:01:45,621 --> 02:01:49,640
it's like a gummy bear boots. Yeah, they
feel like a real breasts. They feel like,

2098
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:54,860
like really from real breasts and I think
that in the future and not so far away

2099
02:01:54,861 --> 02:01:58,250
either they're going to be able to
give you injections that make a woman's

2100
02:01:58,251 --> 02:02:00,500
breasts grow,
but they're going to be able to grow

2101
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:03,890
natural gas. You know, I think if you,

2102
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:07,640
if you don't have breasts and
shit is probably hereditary,
go back down the line.

2103
02:02:07,641 --> 02:02:11,570
You got to bet bunch of flat breasted
us and shit. He goes, most of have,

2104
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:15,720
I remember when I it breaths and Mike,
so Mike,

2105
02:02:16,190 --> 02:02:17,780
I remember as a little girls
with him and he was like,

2106
02:02:17,781 --> 02:02:19,700
if you rub butter on your titties,

2107
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:22,250
they wouldn't grow and
your ass they would grow.

2108
02:02:22,251 --> 02:02:25,860
So we went in fridgerator and took out
my momma butter and we just soaked out

2109
02:02:25,870 --> 02:02:29,360
chest in butter and so, and I'm
thinking that's why I got tennis today.

2110
02:02:29,361 --> 02:02:33,140
So ladies it don't spend your money at
the pleasant surge. Just buy some fucking,

2111
02:02:33,141 --> 02:02:34,640
I can't believe it's not butter.

2112
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:38,420
Puts the two boobs in there and soak them
overnight and see if they grow in two

2113
02:02:38,421 --> 02:02:41,840
weeks. Not sure if that works. I
don't know either. But look at me.

2114
02:02:41,841 --> 02:02:45,140
I'm rocking a 44 double d
with grease up under it.

2115
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:49,280
There's apparently, there's a lot
of people been working at this,

2116
02:02:49,490 --> 02:02:52,150
they've been trying to do
this for a long time and this,

2117
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:55,310
there's a bunch of ways that
can kind of help a little bit,

2118
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:57,980
but they're not exactly,

2119
02:02:58,160 --> 02:03:01,820
they're not really ready to grow tits yet,
but you know what?

2120
02:03:01,821 --> 02:03:03,560
Someone brought up the other
day that made a lot of sense.

2121
02:03:03,770 --> 02:03:06,710
They were saying that like when a woman,
a man becomes a woman,

2122
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:08,570
when he becomes transgender
becomes a woman.

2123
02:03:08,571 --> 02:03:11,460
They start taking estrogen shots and
a lot of times they grow naturally.

2124
02:03:11,910 --> 02:03:12,743
They do.

2125
02:03:12,940 --> 02:03:16,770
I got a son who eats too much Mcdonald's
and he got nice size eight cups.

2126
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:21,250
That's on the same note,
overweight.

2127
02:03:21,270 --> 02:03:25,680
He's overweight so they should gain
weight and grow tea. It might not work.

2128
02:03:25,710 --> 02:03:28,620
It might work, but it might not
work. What they're saying is

2129
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:33,120
that they can give a man injections and
he starts growing like natural boobs.

2130
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:36,680
Wouldn't they be able to give a
woman estrogen and would that make

2131
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:40,920
probably is fuck us up cause
we already produced this crazy

2132
02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:46,980
women in here. Yeah,
right. It's an overflow.

2133
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:50,880
You'll come home and he's been
cooking the cat, right? Yeah.

2134
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:52,620
You don't want to do that.

2135
02:03:53,850 --> 02:03:57,690
There's a lot of fucking problems
apparently with silicone breast implants,

2136
02:03:57,790 --> 02:04:02,790
but particularly the silicone gel can
cause connective tissue or autoimmune

2137
02:04:02,791 --> 02:04:07,620
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and
Lupus, neurological disorders, cancer,

2138
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:11,700
even new silicone related
diseases that didn't exist before.

2139
02:04:11,701 --> 02:04:13,050
Breast enhancement surgery.

2140
02:04:13,110 --> 02:04:15,480
So you got nice tits but
can't open your hands.

2141
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:18,540
You can have some serious, but this
girl was all fucked up that had lupus.

2142
02:04:18,570 --> 02:04:23,190
She was a mess. You know like that's
a, those autoimmune diseases like that,

2143
02:04:23,191 --> 02:04:25,110
like Lupus and no joke,
you know,

2144
02:04:25,210 --> 02:04:27,610
is there, it didn't need plastic
surgery that you would get.

2145
02:04:28,120 --> 02:04:29,140
You know what?
I think man,

2146
02:04:29,141 --> 02:04:34,141
I think we're so close to them being able
to figure out how to do stuff without

2147
02:04:34,331 --> 02:04:37,860
it. Like I don't need plastic surgery.
I'm beautiful. Perfect as I am.

2148
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:42,610
But I've had it. I had hair transplants
when I was younger. Obviously I just,

2149
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:45,270
my hair was falling out and I
was trying to fight against it.

2150
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:48,650
Had trends level doing got no hair.
No, I shave it. I should have shaved.

2151
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:51,703
Yeah.

2152
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:59,570
One way to look at it, why people
stop getting had transplant. Oh,

2153
02:04:59,580 --> 02:05:03,860
you gotta do is go to the hood and get
something to call a quick weave a quick

2154
02:05:05,210 --> 02:05:09,650
what you watch on my head, it's a
whole head of hair for $50. Listen,

2155
02:05:09,651 --> 02:05:13,910
that's not going to work with me. I do
Jujitsu like I'm getting, we don't get,

2156
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:18,730
they don't get it. Like
this shit is not enough

2157
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:22,940
to to not allow to get weaves.
It's just too pathetic.

2158
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:27,540
That'd be shaking and shit
and we can tell this shake,

2159
02:05:27,541 --> 02:05:29,840
get that off near those shave the head.

2160
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,720
I know a guy who works
at the lows in my area,

2161
02:05:32,721 --> 02:05:36,430
he got one and this fucking horrible.
It makes them look like a child molester.

2162
02:05:36,990 --> 02:05:41,540
You kill babies.
No,

2163
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:45,140
but I don't like he creeps me out because
you know there's nothing like seeing

2164
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:48,160
somebody that would a bad we've
when you were weed, right?

2165
02:05:48,290 --> 02:05:51,200
So you have a good one to him,
having a bad one is offensive to you.

2166
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:55,970
It's the whole week.
Like when John Travolta,

2167
02:05:55,971 --> 02:05:59,540
where's his beautiful one and he goes
on the academy awards or you're like

2168
02:05:59,541 --> 02:06:03,970
that's a respectable leave. Yes. I mean
it's gotta look good. The problem is,

2169
02:06:03,971 --> 02:06:07,920
is glued to your head. Not
Anymore. This is sold in Sona.

2170
02:06:09,740 --> 02:06:13,250
Yeah, but if a dude's bald, like if you're
was bald, like I have stubble up here,

2171
02:06:13,251 --> 02:06:17,570
but it was all just, it was going, it
was gone. It was the party was over.

2172
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:21,110
Then what happens is they take hair from
the back of your head and where it's

2173
02:06:21,111 --> 02:06:22,600
never going to fall out
and they move it to,

2174
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:26,480
the joke was that it's like taking a bunch
of really healthy people and you move

2175
02:06:26,481 --> 02:06:28,250
into a neighborhood
where everybody's dying.

2176
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:33,320
Cause that's what it's like when you, you
don't think about that? No, they stayed,

2177
02:06:33,321 --> 02:06:37,790
they stuck around there. The new residents
that like they, they, yeah, they grow,

2178
02:06:38,030 --> 02:06:41,350
but the old hair that used to be
there along with the transplants,

2179
02:06:41,380 --> 02:06:42,860
that's that shit all falls out of it.
Yeah.

2180
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:47,290
So when you grow hair, what do it
look like? Do you look dot. No, no.

2181
02:06:47,291 --> 02:06:48,460
I mean I have have

2182
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:53,370
enough hair to grow my hair out and not
look like I have cancer, but it's not,

2183
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:56,580
it's pretty close. It was going,
it was on. It's getting thinner.

2184
02:06:56,581 --> 02:06:59,150
It was like cotton candy year.
It was getting old.

2185
02:07:00,510 --> 02:07:03,990
It was falling on more and more
and it was, it was annoying.

2186
02:07:04,300 --> 02:07:07,440
But he's still now just shave it.
Yeah they do. Well they do it now.

2187
02:07:07,441 --> 02:07:10,680
They do well what they
call single follicule.

2188
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:12,320
So they'd take like one hair at a time.

2189
02:07:12,321 --> 02:07:13,680
They'll take it from
there and put it up there.

2190
02:07:13,830 --> 02:07:17,190
But the bottom line is you only have so
much hair back here and especially if

2191
02:07:17,191 --> 02:07:21,240
you go full Ronald Mcdonald's,
like if your, your hair goes bald,

2192
02:07:21,241 --> 02:07:22,590
like way back to the edge.

2193
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:25,920
Imagine taking that little edge and
trying to populate your entire head.

2194
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:28,200
Good luck.
You don't have enough hair.

2195
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:31,020
So then they figured out how to clone
hair and that's what they're working on

2196
02:07:31,021 --> 02:07:32,550
now they're working on cloning hair,

2197
02:07:32,790 --> 02:07:36,130
but at the same time they're also
working on some other shit. Like that'll

2198
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:39,100
just genetically there'll be able to
inject it and your skin and it will grow

2199
02:07:39,101 --> 02:07:39,970
hair like crazy.

2200
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:42,760
They're pretty close to being able to
figure that out cause it's some sort of a

2201
02:07:42,761 --> 02:07:46,120
giant multi, multi billion dollar
industry. Dude's losing their hair.

2202
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:49,080
But if I could give anybody any advice
from someone who's already shaved,

2203
02:07:49,081 --> 02:07:51,910
her head,
shave your fucking head.

2204
02:07:52,030 --> 02:07:55,960
I like
his hair too.

2205
02:07:55,961 --> 02:07:57,420
He was trying to hold onto this

2206
02:07:58,010 --> 02:08:01,610
like freeing and I don't
truly do not give a fuck.

2207
02:08:01,611 --> 02:08:03,130
Like it doesn't bother me at all anymore.

2208
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:05,570
My hair used to fuck with me when it
was falling out because I was thinking

2209
02:08:05,571 --> 02:08:07,610
about shaving it, but I wasn't
sure if I could, you know,

2210
02:08:07,611 --> 02:08:12,140
I need you to do is just jump in and do
it. But once I did it I was like, Oh God.

2211
02:08:12,141 --> 02:08:14,870
Yeah. Once I did it though, it was
like, oh, this is so much better.

2212
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:16,910
My husband used to have that kid in play,

2213
02:08:16,950 --> 02:08:21,170
fate in the middle and I was all like,
oh,

2214
02:08:21,171 --> 02:08:25,220
can you fucking get this? Got The Empty
Cup whole off the top of your head.

2215
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:30,650
It looks like a bottle top opener.
What did you want him to do with it?

2216
02:08:30,770 --> 02:08:34,220
Cut The shit off. He was losing,
his hair was and it was like,

2217
02:08:34,221 --> 02:08:36,860
it would grow around the fake,
but it had a hole in the top.

2218
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:40,130
So he was good until he went
on. What the fuck? You know,

2219
02:08:40,131 --> 02:08:42,350
looked like he was keeping a
little safe on top of his head.

2220
02:08:42,530 --> 02:08:46,700
We talked about the poor Jason Alexander
decided at like 50 something years old

2221
02:08:46,701 --> 02:08:50,510
to wear a toupee. Not a out of nowhere. I
don't know Jason, that was on the button.

2222
02:08:50,540 --> 02:08:53,300
You know what I'm saying? Seinfeld,
the show Seinfeld George from Seinfeld.

2223
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:54,860
Do you ever watch Seinfeld?
No.

2224
02:08:54,861 --> 02:08:57,460
You're too busy shooting
people and fucking get it.

2225
02:08:57,730 --> 02:09:00,870
No,
my son feel he turned me onto Scifi.

2226
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:03,690
A little is born that show and
then I watched, I was like,

2227
02:09:03,691 --> 02:09:06,240
this is a fucking great show
is a fucking great show. Yeah.

2228
02:09:06,241 --> 02:09:08,150
We spent many nights watching Seinfeld.

2229
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:10,450
Do you know Richard Pryor story?
Yes.

2230
02:09:10,540 --> 02:09:13,550
Do you know his story of like of
growing up in a brothel? The whole deal,

2231
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:14,953
but yeah,

2232
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:19,180
I know your story's like five times more
crazy than Richard Pryor story. Yeah.

2233
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:22,270
Yeah, I think so. It's pretty
close. I mean, Richard,

2234
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:26,350
I suck no out. Oh, I didn't turn gay
for two weeks. I read Richard Book.

2235
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:29,380
He turned gay for two weeks.
I only probably more than two weeks.

2236
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:33,180
Probably more than two weeks.
It's more likely than he did some stuff.

2237
02:09:33,510 --> 02:09:36,000
I don't know.
I mean there's a different time too.

2238
02:09:36,030 --> 02:09:38,640
If you stop and think about like
what was going on in the 70s,

2239
02:09:38,930 --> 02:09:42,720
think about all the people that are
allegedly involved in gay shit. Well,

2240
02:09:42,721 --> 02:09:47,460
the brothel, right? Yeah. The Brian grew
up, it's prostitute house. Um, but you,

2241
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,960
you know, you look at like, um,

2242
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:54,090
allegedly David Bowie and Mick Jagger
went gay for awhile. You know, like,

2243
02:09:54,091 --> 02:09:58,290
um, what's his name from um, the
WHO, what the fuck is his name?

2244
02:09:58,350 --> 02:10:01,230
Not Roger Daltrey, the other guy. Jamie

2245
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:05,810
towns and Pete Townsend.
Pete Townsend was gay for a while.

2246
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:09,640
It is, it is shit. When you
and Hollywood is no more,

2247
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:12,250
you don't the hell out of a Johnny.
You don't turn it inside out.

2248
02:10:12,251 --> 02:10:15,160
You don't stuck your foot in it.
You don't kick the cross the room.

2249
02:10:15,161 --> 02:10:19,150
You don't bake the pussy. You on a
beat you and bang the pussy. You don't,

2250
02:10:19,420 --> 02:10:22,000
you don't set it on fire. So
he's like, well, you know what,

2251
02:10:22,001 --> 02:10:24,470
I'm going to go away and play with
his Dick and see if I can just take,

2252
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:28,060
takes a dick. Not that a gate
is trying to do something now.

2253
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:32,170
I think that's what they do out here
just in Hollywood because in the Midwest

2254
02:10:32,290 --> 02:10:35,690
they just keep the same old bitch with
the beard who smoked cigarettes and tote

2255
02:10:35,700 --> 02:10:36,740
babies on her heels.

2256
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:39,970
Um, maybe you got a good point. Yeah.

2257
02:10:39,980 --> 02:10:43,350
I think for a lot of dudes it probably
is that they probably want to just expand

2258
02:10:43,351 --> 02:10:44,120
their experiences.

2259
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:48,950
Yeah. It's like getting fingers
putting as I tell you. Let me tell you.

2260
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:53,450
So I went to, I did, I had to do
a hosting for ideal though. Party.

2261
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:57,170
I'm not into deal dose. I don't want
to fudge. How'd you get this job?

2262
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:59,210
They thought I was funny.
They came to a show.

2263
02:10:59,211 --> 02:11:02,600
So they like come hostile deal though.
Party. You have a Dildo party. Yes.

2264
02:11:02,601 --> 02:11:07,060
And women love this bitch.
They got traders, dad got that.

2265
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:11,780
Do you know that they got the news
that the Dick with the suctions on it.

2266
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:15,110
So you stick it to the toilet and
you just have sex with yourself.

2267
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:16,480
When you finish,
you wrench it,

2268
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:19,430
you rinse it off and put
it in the dishwasher or
whatever. Fuck you do with it.

2269
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,420
So I host this deal to a party. So they
gave me this little thing and I said,

2270
02:11:23,421 --> 02:11:26,000
well what is this? She said, well go
home and spice up your relationship.

2271
02:11:26,210 --> 02:11:30,980
So I was like, oh my fucking relationship
could use some spices. I mean,

2272
02:11:30,981 --> 02:11:34,520
you've been married for 23 I
mean, what else? So I was like,

2273
02:11:34,521 --> 02:11:36,910
well what do I do with this? She was
like, this is bowed. Does. She said,

2274
02:11:36,911 --> 02:11:41,270
you take this fella,
you dusty his balls and you ball does.

2275
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:43,220
But he came with a pink fell though.

2276
02:11:43,610 --> 02:11:46,310
So I go home with his bowel does
and I was like, oh your leg.

2277
02:11:46,311 --> 02:11:49,550
I got some bowel does and I pulled
out this felt them. I was like,

2278
02:11:49,551 --> 02:11:52,150
if you don't get that gay
ass kid away from my bottles,

2279
02:11:54,600 --> 02:11:58,710
he wouldn't participate. He wouldn't
have a, it was a fucking fat.

2280
02:11:59,150 --> 02:12:02,870
It was that families who the what the
fuck did you get balled does you're not

2281
02:12:02,871 --> 02:12:06,660
putting that shit on my walls because
it was pink. It would turn them off. No,

2282
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:09,800
I think it was bowed. Does
period. My husband, I going
to do all that extra shit.

2283
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:14,410
Why is pink universally a
girls color? I Love Pink. Huh?

2284
02:12:14,910 --> 02:12:17,600
What's not wrong with the color? But
I mean like, yeah, this is lighter.

2285
02:12:17,610 --> 02:12:20,350
It a pink lighter. It's a hello
kitty lighter. So it's definitely,

2286
02:12:20,351 --> 02:12:23,080
it grows lighter. That's
my light here. Exactly. So

2287
02:12:25,590 --> 02:12:28,780
a girl, we're just being
silly, but this is pink.

2288
02:12:28,781 --> 02:12:31,810
Like why is that color like a girl called?
Why is white?

2289
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:33,190
It's because we never saw,

2290
02:12:33,250 --> 02:12:37,450
because when you grew up your mom put
you girls in a pink bedroom and bought

2291
02:12:37,451 --> 02:12:41,380
pink stuff and when you're a
boy I was boys were blue colors,

2292
02:12:41,381 --> 02:12:45,490
like their bedroom colors.
When you walk around with a baby,

2293
02:12:45,610 --> 02:12:48,970
that was a girl, but it looked like a
boy you put in pink. So people's like,

2294
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,120
oh your little boy is cute. No,
she got on pink as a fucking girl.

2295
02:12:52,121 --> 02:12:56,440
Even though she looked like a boy,
but how did we figure that out though?

2296
02:12:56,441 --> 02:12:59,080
How do we figure out pill for girl?
Joe,

2297
02:12:59,081 --> 02:13:03,760
you got to ask the people who
started it follows Jesus Christ.

2298
02:13:03,761 --> 02:13:08,350
Questions. I don't know. Rosa
Park questions. Not rows apart.

2299
02:13:08,380 --> 02:13:11,250
Maybe Harriet Tubman. Of course.
I don't fucking know how they,

2300
02:13:11,570 --> 02:13:14,620
they came up with this shit.
I got a GED. Let's Google it.

2301
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:19,320
Let's go with why. Why does the Color
Pink be associated with women? Yeah.

2302
02:13:19,940 --> 02:13:21,940
Probably causes a soft
collar because I think,

2303
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:26,970
yeah it is, but isn't white as well.
White is my favorite color. Yeah.

2304
02:13:26,971 --> 02:13:28,860
A lot of people like white.
I have a white car.

2305
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:32,100
It's good for now.
I want to be white because

2306
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:36,420
I watched the leave it to beaver and
beaver. Mama was so fucking supportive.

2307
02:13:38,010 --> 02:13:41,160
I wanted that. Hate it from
my mom. She cooked every day.

2308
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:44,670
You wasn't called bitches.
He wasn't shot at. I like to,

2309
02:13:44,671 --> 02:13:47,430
I want this bitch with my Mama,
so I wanted to be white.

2310
02:13:49,150 --> 02:13:53,740
Yeah, pink. They don't know. They
have no idea. They have no idea.

2311
02:13:53,741 --> 02:13:57,480
It's most commonly associated with
femininity. They don't have any idea why.

2312
02:13:58,230 --> 02:14:00,490
There's a bunch of speculation.
All different.

2313
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:04,750
Pink was likely associated with
boy babies. As with girl babies.

2314
02:14:04,751 --> 02:14:08,710
It's a certain point in time. It was
just associated with babies. We've,

2315
02:14:08,711 --> 02:14:12,830
we had that picture a
member of was it? Uh, which,

2316
02:14:12,970 --> 02:14:16,510
which original PR? It was a theater.
Roosevelt dressed as a girl.

2317
02:14:16,780 --> 02:14:17,650
Oh yeah.
He was young.

2318
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:21,880
They used to these boys pull that
picture up because it's so bizarre.

2319
02:14:22,850 --> 02:14:25,780
Do's dress with weak zone back in the
day. Yeah, but this is when they are

2320
02:14:25,810 --> 02:14:29,470
babies. They dressed him as a baby
when, as a girl, when he was a baby.

2321
02:14:30,190 --> 02:14:32,960
Why? They just did it back
then. They set a date.

2322
02:14:33,260 --> 02:14:36,040
Normal high heels were actually
made for men and stuff like that.

2323
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:40,990
Like they used to dress. Really?
That's why they love him.

2324
02:14:41,140 --> 02:14:44,860
Now. Think about it.
You can take a gay man.

2325
02:14:44,861 --> 02:14:49,780
He do makeup and hair and dress way
better than normal, like a regular female.

2326
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:52,450
Has that been Snopes?
We ever run that through Snopes.

2327
02:14:52,570 --> 02:14:55,220
Theodore Roosevelt supposedly.
No.

2328
02:14:55,980 --> 02:14:58,090
That's the lie that says though.

2329
02:14:58,810 --> 02:15:01,960
Okay. Let's see. Roosevelt
dressed as a girl, debunked

2330
02:15:03,380 --> 02:15:06,710
theater.
Let's see.

2331
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:12,950
It wasn't always wow. It's true. Yeah,
that's true. What that, that the,

2332
02:15:12,970 --> 02:15:17,470
that isn't an actual, it's in the
Atlantic. The uh, the photographs, uh,

2333
02:15:17,590 --> 02:15:22,420
about girls or boys where
the dressing up as girls.

2334
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:24,910
That's totally true.

2335
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:29,290
He had shoulder length hair and a
hat trimmed with a Marabou feather,

2336
02:15:30,310 --> 02:15:33,040
but it not because he was a gender bender.
Um,

2337
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:37,060
the unexpected childhood
look as a reminder that our
cultural norms about gender

2338
02:15:37,061 --> 02:15:42,061
specific clothing for children
are a surprisingly recent
historical development.

2339
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:46,660
Wow. That has interesting,
man. It was 1884.

2340
02:15:46,870 --> 02:15:51,870
He was two and a half years old and boys
wore dresses until age six or seven,

2341
02:15:54,580 --> 02:15:58,120
which was also the time of
their first haircut. Wow.

2342
02:15:58,121 --> 02:15:59,590
That's so weird.

2343
02:16:00,550 --> 02:16:05,200
Franklins outfit was considered
gender neutral. So that outfit,

2344
02:16:05,201 --> 02:16:09,610
pull that outfit up again. That outfit
was considered gender neutral at the time.

2345
02:16:09,640 --> 02:16:12,970
What outfit? The outfit
that he was wearing where we
think it looks like a girl.

2346
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:14,480
Okay.

2347
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:18,870
Look at that. That's, that was gender
neutral. That was a girl with you though.

2348
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:22,730
Yeah. Look at his little
booty shoe and his, his hair.

2349
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:25,610
They didn't cut your hair except
like most aisle across your face. So

2350
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:28,050
see where you're going.
You still look like that.

2351
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:31,480
That's out in the smithsonian.com
also that all this,

2352
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:36,010
they talk about all the pink and blue.
Really detail.

2353
02:16:36,900 --> 02:16:39,130
Yes.
That is that detailed.

2354
02:16:39,970 --> 02:16:43,660
I mean for the Google between pink
and blue. I personal give a fuck,

2355
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:46,120
but I'm learning a lot here.

2356
02:16:46,650 --> 02:16:49,820
I mean that's fascinating to me. It's
fun. It's absolutely fascinating to me.

2357
02:16:49,821 --> 02:16:52,160
I was watching Fox News.
We talked about this before,

2358
02:16:52,370 --> 02:16:55,360
about those women than on Fox
News. No, not because I believe in.

2359
02:16:55,361 --> 02:16:57,740
I just cause it's fascinating.
I love,

2360
02:16:58,310 --> 02:17:02,750
I love people that are convinced of
anything. I want to be convinced of God.

2361
02:17:02,930 --> 02:17:06,140
I'll watch religious shows. I like
people that convinced there is no god.

2362
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:07,190
I watch atheist shows.

2363
02:17:07,191 --> 02:17:11,780
I like watching people convince just to
study their patterns, but I'm watching.

2364
02:17:11,781 --> 02:17:15,230
Fox News is always fascinating to me
because it's like this weird look into

2365
02:17:15,231 --> 02:17:18,770
another world that I don't ever hang out
in. You know, I don't know these people,

2366
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:22,180
but these women are so hot
and they're there, so leggy.

2367
02:17:22,210 --> 02:17:24,330
If someone's naked legs going
on and I was thinking it,

2368
02:17:24,331 --> 02:17:27,780
if a man dress like the on TV,
it would be a fucking shit.

2369
02:17:27,930 --> 02:17:32,930
It was be a sin like you would that if
a guy dressed even remotely like one of

2370
02:17:33,411 --> 02:17:37,190
those women on television, it would
be front page news. It'd be like,

2371
02:17:37,191 --> 02:17:39,460
what the fuck has society fallen too?

2372
02:17:39,610 --> 02:17:42,840
So if a man came in
with like mail ups show,

2373
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:45,400
so I mean really tight.

2374
02:17:46,230 --> 02:17:50,310
Yeah, but that's not, see shorts are one
thing. These women, there's no short,

2375
02:17:50,370 --> 02:17:52,140
there's no fancy.
You have to pull down.

2376
02:17:52,380 --> 02:17:56,610
You just lift their skirt
up and start fucking, it's
right there. Their vagina is,

2377
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:58,800
is a tiny little piece of

2378
02:18:00,410 --> 02:18:04,620
cloth there on Fox. These are,
they have tiny little dresses on

2379
02:18:04,830 --> 02:18:05,140
what?
Oh,

2380
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:08,100
that's what make people tune in and you
flipping through the channel and you see

2381
02:18:08,101 --> 02:18:09,840
a signal. Holy Fuck. Exactly.

2382
02:18:09,841 --> 02:18:12,780
You know you're going to stop and you'll
care what they're saying. I mean, look,

2383
02:18:12,781 --> 02:18:16,230
you're Sarah Paler.
They think she's fucking hot.

2384
02:18:16,940 --> 02:18:20,330
Well, she was harder back in the
day. She was prettier. She's,

2385
02:18:20,390 --> 02:18:24,170
she's starting to hit the wall and
now, now it's getting weird. Not,

2386
02:18:24,340 --> 02:18:26,750
but if you thought she was hot when she
was running for president and like six

2387
02:18:26,751 --> 02:18:29,960
years ago, whatever it was, that would
be kind of, she was Kinda hot back then,

2388
02:18:30,090 --> 02:18:32,750
you know, like a power thing
also, I think maybe, well,

2389
02:18:32,820 --> 02:18:36,920
it was a book and God bless America
sort of a thing, son. She's a little,

2390
02:18:36,921 --> 02:18:40,460
first of all, she's a rugged
outdoorsman. Lives in Alaska. Okay.

2391
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:45,140
Woman's been honor her whole
life and she's kind of pretty,

2392
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,350
well, you know what she
would do? Allegedly,

2393
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:50,770
they would shoot a Caribou
and then they would, uh,

2394
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:54,470
call her for a photo op and she would,
they would, she would get out of her car,

2395
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:57,050
they'd hand her, the gun should
stand down there over the body.

2396
02:18:57,050 --> 02:19:01,220
They take a photo and she'd hop back in
the car and drive off pick. They would,

2397
02:19:01,221 --> 02:19:05,000
uh, they would shoot an
animal just specifically to
make her a little a hunter.

2398
02:19:05,090 --> 02:19:08,990
I know what a care bill is. You know what,
to calculate a deer. Yeah. It's rainbow.

2399
02:19:09,540 --> 02:19:13,130
A reindeer rather, I guess that, but
oh fuck yeah. That's what a Caribou is.

2400
02:19:13,340 --> 02:19:16,760
You know, like when Santa has those
reindeer, that's those are Caribou.

2401
02:19:17,010 --> 02:19:21,140
So in the deer family lose
income to the ghetto? No, no,

2402
02:19:21,170 --> 02:19:25,810
they barely come to Alaska. You've got
to go find it them there. Uh, you know,

2403
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:29,130
we didn't believe Randy laying on your
house if you was getting gift than

2404
02:19:29,140 --> 02:19:32,390
somebody showed up. It was a
fucking Santa Claus with a pit bull.

2405
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:36,300
Did you ever teach your kids about
Santa Claus or did you just, I told him

2406
02:19:38,910 --> 02:19:42,290
it's all bullshit.
I tell you,

2407
02:19:42,291 --> 02:19:44,920
when I moved in my white neighborhood,
I'm in,

2408
02:19:45,020 --> 02:19:48,590
I'm in Walmart one day and my son was
talking about getting something for

2409
02:19:48,591 --> 02:19:52,370
Christmas. He was talking to my son. I
was like, it ain't no fucking Santa. Okay,

2410
02:19:52,610 --> 02:19:56,540
just tell me what you want. And I buy
was what? How old was he at the time?

2411
02:19:56,660 --> 02:20:00,890
He probably was like 10. So a lady, a
white lady in, I like, how dare you,

2412
02:20:00,891 --> 02:20:04,580
not saying it's a seven. I was like,
bitch, he ain't brought me no money.

2413
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:06,590
My own business white woman.

2414
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:09,120
Fuck is you talking about you
want my son to grow up in bleed?

2415
02:20:09,130 --> 02:20:13,360
Some nice fat chubby white dude's just
going to show up and leave Torro. Oh,

2416
02:20:13,370 --> 02:20:16,460
he got a fucking chimney.
I got an electric flight place.

2417
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:18,860
How the fuck are you gonna
get in my house? Exactly.

2418
02:20:18,861 --> 02:20:21,470
How the fuck is he going to get? We'll
get in my house. So she was like, don't,

2419
02:20:21,471 --> 02:20:26,000
don't not tell kids is not Samhsa.
I put up a tree because it's cute.

2420
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:30,590
Isn't that funny?
That you have to like that has to be told.

2421
02:20:30,860 --> 02:20:33,470
That's a lie that we all agree.
You have to tell children.

2422
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:36,320
It's Easter bunny or the tooth fairy.
You would catch.

2423
02:20:36,321 --> 02:20:41,030
I'll catch my stepdad and now taking my
fucking tooth and put $5 up on there and

2424
02:20:41,031 --> 02:20:44,900
when I wake up, my Mama want to
borrow to $5 so she can get high. Wow.

2425
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:48,670
So I'm like all these teeth, you laws

2426

tooth fairies. The weirdest one.

2427
02:20:53,220 --> 02:20:57,390
What is the Easter bunny tooth
fairy Santa Claus was the other one.

2428
02:20:58,020 --> 02:21:02,160
Um, Easter bunny. Tooth fairy.
Santa Claus Secretary's Day

2429
02:21:03,950 --> 02:21:04,960
secretary there.

2430
02:21:06,810 --> 02:21:11,050
That's a failed attempt to my
mother in law won't, won't, uh,

2431
02:21:11,180 --> 02:21:15,110

Super Christian and as the devil's

2432
02:21:15,111 --> 02:21:18,940

2434
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:28,700
DNA and masks. Well what if it's
a mask of like Tokyo or something?

2435
02:21:28,730 --> 02:21:31,610
It's a demon. You shouldn't have. You
shouldn't like my mother. A lot of like,

2436
02:21:31,611 --> 02:21:32,361
you shouldn't have like,

2437
02:21:32,361 --> 02:21:34,940
you know how people have those fat
LF loons and shit on they flow.

2438
02:21:35,630 --> 02:21:39,050
You can have that because
they care is deans hold up

2439
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:44,510
um, fat elephants on their floor
carry demons. What? You know,

2440
02:21:44,511 --> 02:21:47,020
you know how you go and people
having to have those uh,

2441
02:21:47,270 --> 02:21:50,680
those glass elephant shit and
tigers laying on the floor.

2442
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:54,380
You been at black houses with yeah, the
black leather couch and like a sculpture.

2443
02:21:54,590 --> 02:21:57,720
Yeah. That she didn't have
those. No, not where I'm on in.

2444
02:21:57,800 --> 02:22:02,630
She say that stuff carries Dino's,
she's super say golf truth carry demons.

2445
02:22:02,980 --> 02:22:06,740
Sh the, the, I don't know where she
gets a shit for. Only read that one.

2446
02:22:06,890 --> 02:22:10,510
That's a tough one. Like you know,
someone makes a sculpture like that.

2447
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:13,670
The Eagle sculpture in San Francisco,
I grew up,

2448
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:16,190
I grew up in like my
momma had a Jesus pitches.

2449
02:22:16,220 --> 02:22:19,670
Every black household had a Jesus
Christ and I'm all of the king pitcher.

2450
02:22:19,700 --> 02:22:22,550
You wasn't black if you didn't have
no fucking two pitches in your house.

2451
02:22:22,610 --> 02:22:25,590
How come nobody knows who Rosa Parks's.
Nobody knows what she looks like.

2452
02:22:25,591 --> 02:22:26,100
I got this

2453
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:30,840
photo of Rosa Parks Mugshot up on the
wall and everybody thinks that it's a

2454
02:22:31,410 --> 02:22:35,370
Asian lady. I thought she
was. I just don't understand.

2455
02:22:37,230 --> 02:22:40,140
I don't, I don't know how. That's
not a famous person. How's that?

2456
02:22:40,141 --> 02:22:43,610
Not a famous person.
It's a fee as persons who she was,

2457
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:48,680
but how's it not like recognizable like
Martin Luther King Recognizable Malcolm

2458
02:22:49,831 --> 02:22:53,550
x recognizable. If you saw his
photo galleries, is that what it is?

2459
02:22:53,730 --> 02:22:56,280
She's probably by ratio.
Oh, for sure. Yeah.

2460
02:22:56,281 --> 02:22:59,160
She's definitely biracial
by the her coloration,

2461
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:05,070
but I don't know. Just probably
better instead of doing that.

2462
02:23:05,071 --> 02:23:08,790
Well, you could do that, but it's hard
to zoom in on that. Yeah, there you go.

2463
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:12,600
That's what Rosa parks look like.
Nobody knows.

2464
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:17,520
So she was a lady that said
no. She said, fuck this.

2465
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:22,400
I'm sitting right here, became
fit boy, they fucking to move.

2466
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:25,570
She looked white. Nobody asked
her to move, but they say x. Dot.

2467
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:30,210
I think in that at that time it's like
she was the tipping point, you know,

2468
02:23:30,810 --> 02:23:34,260
people date. Imagine,
imagine when they had whites,

2469
02:23:34,261 --> 02:23:38,250
only fountains and shit.
My daddy always talked about that shit.

2470
02:23:38,690 --> 02:23:42,090
He passed about three years ago when I
brought him to Indianapolis to live with

2471
02:23:42,091 --> 02:23:45,630
me. And my daddy really never lived
around white people. So when my son,

2472
02:23:45,631 --> 02:23:49,680
all his friends was white. So my data
was say like Pat, you got to get Gary.

2473
02:23:49,681 --> 02:23:52,860
He had that pulling them a little cracker
keys on his motorcycle and I'm like,

2474
02:23:52,861 --> 02:23:57,510
damn, ain't nobody say that shit anymore.
He was, he had a slave mentality.

2475
02:23:58,080 --> 02:23:59,070
Well,
if you stop and thought yeah,

2476
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:00,730
about it for a second,
like how,

2477
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:06,120
how recent slavery was a really kind
of freaks you out because that was 1865

2478
02:24:06,431 --> 02:24:09,720
they made slavery legal. That
is not that long ago. No,

2479
02:24:10,300 --> 02:24:15,190
that is not that long ago. That is
weird. That's less than 200 years.

2480
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:20,200
Stop. And think about that.
1865 that's not that long ago.

2481
02:24:20,710 --> 02:24:25,510
If you lived to be a hundred years, if
you, if you're a hundred years old today.

2482
02:24:25,540 --> 02:24:30,040
Okay. And that means that
in 1914 you were born, okay.

2483
02:24:30,190 --> 02:24:33,760
If you were born in 1914 a
hundred years before that,

2484
02:24:34,210 --> 02:24:37,630
1814 slavery's legal as fuck.

2485
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:42,420
So that's like two generations, you
know, grandfather to father to grant his,

2486
02:24:42,520 --> 02:24:44,920
you know like if you go back like
two more generations before that,

2487
02:24:45,160 --> 02:24:46,540
that's not that many people.

2488
02:24:46,690 --> 02:24:50,770
That's like a guy has give a woman,

2489
02:24:50,771 --> 02:24:55,390
gives birth to a child, the child gets
raised, has children of his own and then,

2490
02:24:55,460 --> 02:24:58,270
and maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe

2491
02:24:59,050 --> 02:25:02,770
are alive like the, the patterns of
people that are live birth to death,

2492
02:25:02,771 --> 02:25:06,910
birth to death. There's only three,
three generations of birth to death.

2493
02:25:07,210 --> 02:25:10,340
And you got, I mean, not a guy
giving birth, you know, I'm,

2494
02:25:10,341 --> 02:25:14,110
I'm a woman giving birth to her own child
and him giving birth to his own child,

2495
02:25:14,111 --> 02:25:17,710
but a person living from birth to death,
the next pink person being born,

2496
02:25:17,890 --> 02:25:22,780
birth to death. There's only three that's
not that long. And that was buying.

2497
02:25:22,781 --> 02:25:24,160
People could just buy them

2498
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:27,220
and take them. You could fuck
them and you could kill them.

2499
02:25:27,221 --> 02:25:29,670
You can do whatever you want. And
there wasn't any laws. They were yours.

2500
02:25:29,671 --> 02:25:31,310
They were your property.
Yeah.

2501
02:25:31,610 --> 02:25:34,360
They would just tell you if you beat
him to tell you not to beat him as much.

2502
02:25:34,900 --> 02:25:37,750
And I don't fucking know. I wasn't
around, but I couldn't imagine.

2503
02:25:38,590 --> 02:25:42,400
Could you even imagine, can you imagine
owning a person in your backyard?

2504
02:25:42,530 --> 02:25:43,660
What's fucked is when you hear this,

2505
02:25:43,661 --> 02:25:48,660
just as much slavery today as there
was during during 1865 if you like,

2506
02:25:48,670 --> 02:25:51,040
looked at the world,
the whole world as far as the numbers,

2507
02:25:51,910 --> 02:25:55,720
six slave shit going on with the younger
kids. I heard a lot of those kids,

2508
02:25:56,020 --> 02:25:56,853
the it,

2509
02:25:59,810 --> 02:26:01,520
well,
I will say I liked it,

2510
02:26:01,521 --> 02:26:05,280
but I don't think those kids
like he wouldn't let me go home.

2511
02:26:06,630 --> 02:26:09,860
Of course they don't like it.
Imagine that someone would justify it.

2512
02:26:09,950 --> 02:26:13,790
Sex Slavery, like, look, look, look.
This is other problems in the world.

2513
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:17,000
Can we have an energy problem?
This global warming.

2514
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:19,870
That's probably,
that's how they look at it and look,

2515
02:26:19,871 --> 02:26:22,330
you had to ban your momma didn't
have shit. Come on over here.

2516
02:26:22,331 --> 02:26:23,740
It's like a few deek.
Let me feed you.

2517
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:28,920
Well, you made it work. You you,
you were like a person who was,

2518
02:26:29,340 --> 02:26:31,020
I mean you a sec.
It's actually molested.

2519
02:26:31,230 --> 02:26:34,950
If you are having sex with a man in his
twenties and you're 14 or you were 12 at

2520
02:26:34,951 --> 02:26:37,680
the time when it first started,
you're being sexually molested.

2521
02:26:37,710 --> 02:26:42,620
You made it work, but it was good.
Sexually molested. He was horrible.

2522
02:26:43,110 --> 02:26:48,110
Yeah. Yeah. Just didn't give him credit
for that, but it was good. And employed.

2523
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:51,320
Unemployed black means a can.
Fuck.

2524
02:26:55,310 --> 02:26:59,590
That's all my husband.
No lists I listening to.

2525
02:26:59,820 --> 02:27:02,110
But if we're going to see photos of this,
don't you want us,

2526
02:27:02,130 --> 02:27:06,440
cause I really want to see when you're
just walking. No, no, no, no, no bro.

2527
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:11,270
They coming to your
house to go to jail. You

2528
02:27:13,780 --> 02:27:18,140
know what he means is a 12 year old. That
looks like a grown woman. I want to see,

2529
02:27:18,141 --> 02:27:22,470
do you have boobs or are you holding
like a teddy bear and looking back at 16

2530
02:27:22,990 --> 02:27:26,840
yeah. Wow. Yeah, that'll work. Let me
see if I can get this fucking phone.

2531
02:27:26,870 --> 02:27:29,650
I can show you me at 16 you
know what was crazy? I was at,

2532
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:32,180
that was a drug deal on his pitches.
So my daughter was like,

2533
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:35,690
oh you don't look like I expected
you to look. And I was like,

2534
02:27:35,691 --> 02:27:37,780
well what do you expect? You
know, gold teeth. And I was like,

2535
02:27:37,781 --> 02:27:41,130
I wasn't fucking up my teeth cause
you fucking crazy. You don't know.

2536
02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:44,860
It was the most, that was the biggest
scam in the ghetto. Those. Dennis,

2537
02:27:44,870 --> 02:27:49,870
we're putting teeth go teeth on those
cricket as black people t when I shouldn't

2538
02:27:50,031 --> 02:27:51,140
say,
hey dude,

2539
02:27:51,141 --> 02:27:55,810
take this dope money and get some braces
first before you fucking Crowley's both.

2540
02:27:56,120 --> 02:27:58,710
Before you cram these goals
on these raggedy ass tea.

2541
02:27:58,790 --> 02:28:01,190
So you made a club and it's my fault.
Got Teeth in his map.

2542
02:28:01,191 --> 02:28:05,930
Look like a Perato you like what the fuck?
Okay,

2543
02:28:05,931 --> 02:28:06,764
explain that to me

2544
02:28:06,770 --> 02:28:09,740
cause I'm white.
What is it about gold teeth?

2545
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:13,720
It's not about goatee. Black
people are flashy. We like go.

2546
02:28:13,721 --> 02:28:15,940
We like shit this shine.
Why is that?

2547
02:28:16,030 --> 02:28:20,980
Because we want to stand out and I tell
you, we wait, wait, wait black people.

2548
02:28:20,990 --> 02:28:22,040
We want you to know we

2549
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:26,900
got it. Ah, because you really, you come
from not having it. So when you get it,

2550
02:28:26,901 --> 02:28:29,120
you tell the fucking road.
Cause I was just telling my friend,

2551
02:28:29,121 --> 02:28:33,560
I said what is it with black people that
are run out and buy buy thousand dollar

2552
02:28:33,561 --> 02:28:34,051
jeans.

2553
02:28:34,051 --> 02:28:38,630
It you fucking got a food stamp card
but your pocket book costs $800.

2554
02:28:38,990 --> 02:28:40,100
You know,
you gotta fucking,

2555
02:28:40,130 --> 02:28:43,830
you gotta get a name brand purse or you
get a knock off name brand purse for

2556
02:28:43,831 --> 02:28:47,900
$200 and in any fucking real
leather and it don't have no value.

2557
02:28:48,050 --> 02:28:50,330
Just so people can say,
I'm told him Michael Cole,

2558
02:28:50,331 --> 02:28:53,000
I'm talking a little bit on what we know
is not a little bit torn because you're

2559
02:28:53,001 --> 02:28:56,870
fucking cause raggedy and your teeth
this cricket and you got a band,

2560
02:28:56,871 --> 02:29:01,130
we've bitched and you got a lot of kids
behind you. You don't buy Louis Tom.

2561
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:04,170
If you're fucking, you got four or
five kids that don't work like that.

2562
02:29:04,171 --> 02:29:05,690
Don't bad start at two grand.

2563
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:08,270
But Louis Vuitton,
it's like not like a Ferrari.

2564
02:29:08,330 --> 02:29:11,570
Like if you get a fake Louis Vuitton, what
happens? It doesn't hold shit, you know?

2565
02:29:11,860 --> 02:29:14,670
No, she is foam and they act like
it's real. You know what I mean?

2566
02:29:14,671 --> 02:29:19,620
Like if you have a fake Ferrari, you know
you're not driving Ferraris for ours,

2567
02:29:19,740 --> 02:29:21,560
they fall apart. The
person's fall apart. Very

2568
02:29:22,120 --> 02:29:25,300
China. They're making fake Ferrari's
right now and a God damn assembly line.

2569
02:29:25,330 --> 02:29:27,510
I bet this dude's out there
that have fake Ferrari's.

2570
02:29:27,550 --> 02:29:30,640
Don't even know they have fake Ferrari's.
It's probably totally possible.

2571
02:29:30,940 --> 02:29:32,410
I never heard him to thank for Roger,

2572
02:29:32,411 --> 02:29:36,370
but I know by some fake bags and
want to be flashy and you know,

2573
02:29:36,371 --> 02:29:39,970
and I was going to get a gold
grill when I was a drug dealer,

2574
02:29:39,971 --> 02:29:40,870
but I had a friend was like,

2575
02:29:41,080 --> 02:29:44,140
you're not always going to do this
shit and you have really nice teeth,

2576
02:29:44,260 --> 02:29:45,550
so why would you fuck them up?

2577
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:49,310
So if you did get gold teeth, they have
to like chip out the outside of it. Yeah.

2578
02:29:49,370 --> 02:29:54,110
No they do. They, they, what they do is
they, my brother had beautiful teeth.

2579
02:29:54,380 --> 02:29:54,651
I mean,

2580
02:29:54,651 --> 02:29:59,150
he could've did a fucking
Colgate commercial and he
went and got a goal and they,

2581
02:29:59,151 --> 02:29:59,410
they,

2582
02:29:59,410 --> 02:30:03,710
they fucking moved his front teeth and
put a gap there so they can push the goal

2583
02:30:03,711 --> 02:30:05,960
up. And he decided, I
don't like this shit.

2584
02:30:05,961 --> 02:30:10,520
This country has brother my put a pin
in his mouth and rip the goal off his

2585
02:30:10,521 --> 02:30:11,870
teeth.
Wow.

2586
02:30:13,970 --> 02:30:14,803
About,

2587
02:30:14,970 --> 02:30:17,310
no, it didn't bleed. He was
just my brother. He'll build it.

2588
02:30:17,330 --> 02:30:20,970
I until I got two brothers with the
same name and that they're not twin.

2589
02:30:21,180 --> 02:30:24,270
The name is Anthony and Tony and
that they real fucking night.

2590
02:30:26,220 --> 02:30:28,440
And you know what Joe,
I didn't even know that.

2591
02:30:28,500 --> 02:30:31,170
I didn't even recognize that
until my house. Like, Pat,

2592
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:34,020
what are your brothers have
the same night. I was like,

2593
02:30:34,320 --> 02:30:38,040
my fucking brother's don't have to say
that. My name is Tony. He was like, Pat,

2594
02:30:38,070 --> 02:30:41,700
that's the same. That's, Oh, what
the fuck? That is the same name.

2595
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:46,420
No one else has the same name. John and
Jack. What did they not John and Jay.

2596
02:30:47,210 --> 02:30:50,960
John F. Kennedy was Jack Kennedy. Yeah.

2597
02:30:51,980 --> 02:30:56,360
John F. Kennedy was Jack. They called him
Jack Kennedy. That's it makes no sense.

2598
02:30:56,690 --> 02:31:00,560
It's one of the weirdest ones.
That's a weird one to weird abbreviation,

2599
02:31:00,730 --> 02:31:04,190
but that abbreviation is
not always used. Like, um,

2600
02:31:04,910 --> 02:31:08,240
I know a Jack that was born Jack, like
on his birth certificate it says Jack,

2601
02:31:08,900 --> 02:31:13,430
but John is the, you know the nickname
of John Has Jack, is it j? O? H? N?

2602
02:31:15,190 --> 02:31:18,470
I don't know. It's a good question.
You're at 16. This photograph.

2603
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:20,450
Here's

2604
02:31:20,450 --> 02:31:23,700
why. That was one of a kind.
Let me see that. That's you.

2605
02:31:23,701 --> 02:31:27,870
At 16 would him and that's the dude.
That's a grown ass man. I had the baby by.

2606
02:31:28,030 --> 02:31:31,660
Wow. That's crazy. That's
the dude that shot you.

2607
02:31:32,310 --> 02:31:35,860
That's the dude who shot me. Well, this
is hard to see because it's kind of a,

2608
02:31:36,160 --> 02:31:41,110
an old picture. Yeah, but what did you do?

2609
02:31:41,130 --> 02:31:43,230
His phone.
How'd you shoot this phone?

2610
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:48,420
I broke the in Lowe's at the
hardware store. Yeah. Is that a note?

2611
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:52,170
Yeah, that's a no. Those are great,
aren't they? Yeah. For old people like me,

2612
02:31:52,171 --> 02:31:55,800
who wants to see those are great for
going online though. Looking at web pages,

2613
02:31:55,850 --> 02:32:00,180
you can't beat it. You can't beat it
for that. So here's me as a drug dealer.

2614
02:32:01,010 --> 02:32:04,410
Oh, I'll show you my kids. Unfortunately.

2615
02:32:04,411 --> 02:32:08,330
This is a podcast that people listen to.
I'm showing it to you. I know, I know,

2616
02:32:08,370 --> 02:32:11,040
but I'm saying that I wish
that everybody who listens,

2617
02:32:11,041 --> 02:32:15,180
it could get out a photograph with us.
That's your kids right here. That's me.

2618
02:32:15,181 --> 02:32:16,830
Like 16 wow.

2619
02:32:18,710 --> 02:32:19,530
Yeah.

2620
02:32:19,530 --> 02:32:20,460
That's crazy.

2621
02:32:20,490 --> 02:32:24,660
You at 16 with two kids and one
of them looks like it's six.

2622
02:32:27,710 --> 02:32:30,320
I'm not even fucking around.
That's crazy.

2623
02:32:30,650 --> 02:32:35,500
That's a child with children chow.
It's your crazy life. Miss Pat.

2624
02:32:35,900 --> 02:32:38,570
Yes I did. How did you, how did
you choose? The name is pat.

2625
02:32:38,810 --> 02:32:41,720
How'd you go with Miss Pat?
Because I was going to name myself rabbit,

2626
02:32:41,810 --> 02:32:44,450
but that was too close to my drug in life.
Right.

2627
02:32:44,451 --> 02:32:46,990
And so I didn't want him to
come to the stage ram it.

2628
02:32:46,991 --> 02:32:48,410
They're just too fucking blind.

2629
02:32:52,410 --> 02:32:53,243
Ah.

2630
02:32:54,140 --> 02:32:56,060
Sounds like, Ooh. Can I call my seven?

2631
02:32:56,061 --> 02:32:58,780
At that time when I started being
a comedian, I still had them,

2632
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:03,020
the little vending business at the
Donaldson and all my daughter school

2633
02:33:03,770 --> 02:33:07,040
classmate works for me. So everybody
called me Miss Pat. So I was like,

2634
02:33:07,041 --> 02:33:10,460
where did it make people respect
me, Miss Pat? So I was like, okay,

2635
02:33:10,461 --> 02:33:14,510
the key is naming. That's
a good one. I like Miss
[inaudible]. My name is Patricia.

2636
02:33:14,690 --> 02:33:16,980
Very well. It's very easy
to remember too. And it's,

2637
02:33:16,981 --> 02:33:19,790
it's unique to you and you
automatically know on black.

2638
02:33:21,190 --> 02:33:25,280
It could be Jay, like an Asian. No.
You automatically know Miss Pat.

2639
02:33:25,310 --> 02:33:26,120
That could be an Asian,

2640
02:33:26,120 --> 02:33:29,570
a crazy Asian chicken wears tight
leather clothes or a gay Asian dude.

2641
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:32,830
No, I've walked up on people
like him in mainstream ones.

2642
02:33:32,831 --> 02:33:34,620
Things like who performed the
night? He was like, Miss Pat,

2643
02:33:35,270 --> 02:33:38,830
miss pat gotta be black. It's got to be
some Dev jam and I'm standing. I'm like,

2644
02:33:38,831 --> 02:33:39,760
no bitch.

2645
02:33:40,310 --> 02:33:44,350
The fuck is you talking about white
boy with your cat jokes with your cat.

2646
02:33:48,280 --> 02:33:51,360
Why did he catch up?
Because like you'll go to amazing club.

2647
02:33:51,380 --> 02:33:53,360
Are you fucking hear his cat jokes?
I'm like,

2648
02:33:53,570 --> 02:33:57,730
don't you fucking white boys rob a bank
so you can be more fucking interesting.

2649
02:33:57,890 --> 02:34:02,730
You gift that basters gifted bastards.
Yeah. You had a privileged privilege.

2650
02:34:02,731 --> 02:34:04,520
Basters I don't want to hear your cat.

2651
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:07,520
You don't want to fucking change
your little box. Hey, come on.

2652
02:34:07,521 --> 02:34:11,810
Let's rob a grocery store bit so we
can eat. Let's do some real life shit.

2653
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:15,920
What kind of cat jokes are you here? Is
this Indianapolis catch no. Everywhere.

2654
02:34:17,490 --> 02:34:17,980
Joe

2655
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:22,270
and I don't fucking tell a cat joke
in from it. Fucking drives my vagina.

2656
02:34:22,540 --> 02:34:27,060
Go onstage at the UCB. What the fuck is
that? That's the hipster club. That's it.

2657
02:34:27,061 --> 02:34:29,710
Do it. Do is wear cardigans
and the, they all have cats.

2658
02:34:30,790 --> 02:34:35,210
No, I have cute two cats. You do?

2659
02:34:35,260 --> 02:34:38,090
I have two cats.
Two dogs and 24 chickens.

2660
02:34:38,660 --> 02:34:41,960
What a fuck do you live in
California with chickens? I live.

2661
02:34:42,230 --> 02:34:45,710
I got to tell you my chicken shout Joe.
You got the chicken store? Yeah, I have.

2662
02:34:45,711 --> 02:34:47,990
My Mama had one chicken in the back.
She had a lot of them,

2663
02:34:47,991 --> 02:34:52,130
but she eventually killed them out.
So I'm telling you to choose.

2664
02:34:52,350 --> 02:34:55,820
So we,
when my life was so bad,

2665
02:34:55,821 --> 02:34:59,330
I would go outside every day and just
tell this chicken everything, you know,

2666
02:34:59,331 --> 02:35:02,080
cuckoo.
My Momma ain't shooting at us.

2667
02:35:04,130 --> 02:35:08,030
It was cool. Was cool.
Cool. Oh fucking hate it.

2668
02:35:08,040 --> 02:35:10,440
Then my mom was so I would talk
to this chicken and you know,

2669
02:35:10,460 --> 02:35:11,850
chicken walking around
eating shit off the ground.

2670
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:16,570
I really thought he was concerned and
was listening to me. So how does Lee,

2671
02:35:16,610 --> 02:35:19,250
I come home from school and
this bitch got my chicken,

2672
02:35:19,251 --> 02:35:23,120
my only friend that was listened to my
pain by the neck and getting ready to

2673
02:35:23,121 --> 02:35:26,750
kill him and a chicken as is big and I'm
looking at it chicken and he looked at

2674
02:35:26,751 --> 02:35:30,410
me and I'm like, Nigga, you snitch on
me and she don't fucking kill me neck.

2675
02:35:31,790 --> 02:35:34,460
And she killed that chicken
and she made me eat it.

2676
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:38,810
Wow. That was well you know that's
what a lot of people have chickens for.

2677
02:35:38,870 --> 02:35:40,190
They kill them and eat them.

2678
02:35:40,710 --> 02:35:42,610
I didn't know.
I made friends with it so I,

2679
02:35:42,670 --> 02:35:44,460
that's why I don't have
a chicken for a pet.

2680
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:49,600
I don't have a doubt because I had a
dog named pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,

2681
02:35:50,490 --> 02:35:52,770
pop, pop, Kukula pup. I ice
a lot of fuck out of him.

2682
02:35:52,771 --> 02:35:56,970
So we're running right and got reelected.
Pup got upset about the election,

2683
02:35:56,971 --> 02:36:00,420
I assume and jumped out the back porch
with a change on the neck in fucking hung

2684
02:36:00,421 --> 02:36:01,510
herself.
Wow.

2685
02:36:01,560 --> 02:36:06,010
That's why I won't vote Republican
because I run a and kill my fucking die.

2686
02:36:09,020 --> 02:36:09,853
Reagan

2687
02:36:10,740 --> 02:36:13,280
moved to Canada because of George Bush.
Really?

2688
02:36:13,340 --> 02:36:17,360
I thought about that shit when he read
one. When he won in 2004 I was like,

2689
02:36:17,361 --> 02:36:20,630
this is, this is a crazy place to live.
I've got to get out of here. When he won,

2690
02:36:20,670 --> 02:36:21,081
we won.

2691
02:36:21,081 --> 02:36:24,350
I was seriously thinking about going to
Vancouver and that was on TV at the time.

2692
02:36:24,650 --> 02:36:25,483
I was like,

2693
02:36:26,120 --> 02:36:29,480
I would have been hard for me to move to
Canada and still come back and do fear

2694
02:36:29,481 --> 02:36:33,260
factor, but I was like, this is not
good. This is insane place to live.

2695
02:36:33,261 --> 02:36:36,440
We've got to get out of
here. I was totally convinced
we had to get out of here.

2696
02:36:37,090 --> 02:36:39,820
Oh Shit. Going to try to get all my
friends moved to Vancouver to, yeah,

2697
02:36:40,390 --> 02:36:42,280
they all say they want to do shit for us,

2698
02:36:42,281 --> 02:36:44,350
but in the end we are going
to get fucked up by them.

2699
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:47,080
They don't give a fuck about us.
They just want to buy nice meals,

2700
02:36:47,380 --> 02:36:50,100
nice suits and do the fuck
they want to do. I wonder,

2701
02:36:50,140 --> 02:36:53,140
people don't care about people anymore.
When I was little Joe,

2702
02:36:53,260 --> 02:36:58,260
you could go to the black church and
eat on Sunday for free for years until

2703
02:36:59,140 --> 02:37:02,380
Ronald Reagan got reelected.
I'm telling you,

2704
02:37:02,381 --> 02:37:07,210
he fucked us up because after that they
started charging $5 for the meal and I

2705
02:37:07,211 --> 02:37:10,450
haven't, I haven't been back to the
church since five bucks seems reasonable,

2706
02:37:10,630 --> 02:37:14,570
but not when you live where I
fucking live in the 80s right? Oh,

2707
02:37:14,571 --> 02:37:16,130
those was five bucks

2708
02:37:16,490 --> 02:37:19,020
once a month, right?
That was like $10 right?

2709
02:37:19,490 --> 02:37:23,350
Probably 20 in my neighborhood when
we didn't even eat fucking fruit.

2710
02:37:23,360 --> 02:37:25,430
We ate beans every fucking day.

2711
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:29,150
But don't you think they like times
are tough and prices for things are

2712
02:37:29,151 --> 02:37:30,500
expensive and people would,

2713
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:32,600
do you really think that people
don't care about people anymore?

2714
02:37:32,900 --> 02:37:35,240
No, they don't. They don't
shoot you out though.

2715
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:39,770
If you my friend,
you might fucking frame.

2716
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:41,350
All right.
Are We fucking friends or what?

2717
02:37:41,660 --> 02:37:44,900
We're not fucking free. I mean,
you said my fucking friend.

2718
02:37:46,380 --> 02:37:50,350
You Scad of words. I am. Yeah.

2719
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:53,930
You my friend. You're my friend
and I'll do anything for you.

2720
02:37:53,931 --> 02:37:57,170
I'm not a too faced that type bitch.
I'm down with you,

2721
02:37:57,920 --> 02:38:02,630
but people would say they down
with you to get what you got so

2722
02:38:05,510 --> 02:38:10,250
you could say that about his business
in this bit. This is a cut throat.

2723
02:38:10,580 --> 02:38:13,430
This is almost like getting
a drive by in the hood.

2724
02:38:13,930 --> 02:38:15,880
I disagree. You know
why? Why are you here?

2725
02:38:15,881 --> 02:38:18,310
Then you here because we want to help you.

2726
02:38:19,730 --> 02:38:22,350
We found that we've heard about you,
but this is the business.

2727
02:38:22,380 --> 02:38:26,190
This business is right.
I'm not saying everybody's like that.

2728
02:38:26,330 --> 02:38:31,330
This business is going on right now in
this room is this business and in this

2729
02:38:31,671 --> 02:38:35,000
business we're just trying to
help you so that's bullshit.

2730
02:38:35,140 --> 02:38:38,640
What does you can find?
No, you can find it.

2731
02:38:38,730 --> 02:38:42,510
Those people, this is this. This is
my thoughts on this business. Yeah,

2732
02:38:42,511 --> 02:38:44,760
you can find those
people in this business,

2733
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:46,410
but you could find
those people everywhere.

2734
02:38:46,530 --> 02:38:49,590
You could also find people that are nice.
Yes.

2735
02:38:49,620 --> 02:38:51,720
I really believe people,

2736
02:38:51,750 --> 02:38:54,900
there's more nice people than people
give credit for because the negative

2737
02:38:55,050 --> 02:38:59,190
instances stand out. It's like
when people talk about like online,

2738
02:38:59,191 --> 02:39:01,620
like commenters on youtube
and shit like that.

2739
02:39:02,380 --> 02:39:05,220
Think about what percentage of people
that is like everyone's like if it was a

2740
02:39:05,221 --> 02:39:08,010
perfect example that society is doomed.
Go read.

2741
02:39:08,011 --> 02:39:10,410
Like I was reading something about
Floyd Mayweather the other day.

2742
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:14,670
Floyd Mayweather took a picture with
his new girlfriend and they'll fucking

2743
02:39:14,671 --> 02:39:16,330
comments were soap.

2744
02:39:16,710 --> 02:39:21,310
I think that is even when you get on
youtube but you get up and you talk about

2745
02:39:21,311 --> 02:39:24,550
Beyonce baby hair. I was
like, these people are human.

2746
02:39:24,551 --> 02:39:28,870
Like people will say shit to me and act
like I did a podcast and I talked about

2747
02:39:28,871 --> 02:39:32,590
putting drugs in my baby panties and
everybody was at the time was tween you to

2748
02:39:32,591 --> 02:39:34,770
get me on. So this dude was like, oh,

2749
02:39:34,780 --> 02:39:37,860
why would you want her own Joe rugged
when she put drugs in my baby pen. I said,

2750
02:39:37,861 --> 02:39:40,540
hold on bitch.
I was 15 years old at the time.

2751
02:39:40,541 --> 02:39:43,970
Have you thought about where I was
in my life at that time? I said,

2752
02:39:43,971 --> 02:39:48,340
plus don't judge me bitch. You probably
like fucking frozen Q commas up yo ass.

2753
02:39:48,460 --> 02:39:51,340
But nobody's coming over your house
trying to pull it frozen cube commas out

2754
02:39:51,341 --> 02:39:53,600
your ass.
I'm not judging you because you like,

2755
02:39:57,970 --> 02:40:01,310
cause
if he doesn't feel frozen cucumber,

2756
02:40:05,230 --> 02:40:09,980
I mean when people, people do, they write
ugly stuff. Sometime I look at it, they

2757
02:40:09,980 --> 02:40:12,200
don't have to deal with you face to face.

2758
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:15,570
See that's not a normal way
to communicate with people.

2759
02:40:15,660 --> 02:40:18,180
You people get a free shot
at you like you're miss pat.

2760
02:40:18,330 --> 02:40:20,940
You know you're on the Internet,
you're on a video,

2761
02:40:20,941 --> 02:40:25,320
they see it and they can just start
talking shit for free and more than one.

2762
02:40:25,350 --> 02:40:27,900
It's not one on one.
Like if you were doing that in a room,

2763
02:40:28,260 --> 02:40:29,940
our knock,
they fucking ass.

2764
02:40:30,860 --> 02:40:32,930
Listen,
if you're in a room,

2765
02:40:32,960 --> 02:40:34,640
like say if you were in a
room and you're talking to me,

2766
02:40:34,641 --> 02:40:37,940
and then someone who is a youtube commoner
was sitting right there and listening

2767
02:40:37,941 --> 02:40:39,020
to you talk,
you see,

2768
02:40:39,060 --> 02:40:41,960
you see someone who would say
something awful about you on Youtube.

2769
02:40:42,110 --> 02:40:45,740
If they were sitting right next to you,
they wouldn't say, they wouldn't say shit.

2770
02:40:45,800 --> 02:40:48,500
Yeah, they wouldn't say shit.
And if they did say shift,

2771
02:40:48,501 --> 02:40:52,070
they did say something rude. He'd be
like, where the fuck are you coming from?

2772
02:40:52,071 --> 02:40:55,010
Why are you coming up with it? I'm not,
first of all, I'm not talking about you.

2773
02:40:55,100 --> 02:40:59,090
I'm not talking to you. It doesn't concern
you. So why you making some sort of,

2774
02:40:59,091 --> 02:41:02,600
and then you'd have a conversation with
that person and they would be shown to

2775
02:41:02,601 --> 02:41:07,190
be retarded and then it would be done,
but they could just leave it on youtube.

2776
02:41:07,190 --> 02:41:10,760
That comment is permanent.
Yes. This moron statement,

2777
02:41:10,761 --> 02:41:13,250
that's not supposed to happen in nature.
It's just not.

2778
02:41:13,730 --> 02:41:16,910
When you think about how many people
that is though, that's a small,

2779
02:41:17,020 --> 02:41:19,760
what percentage of the people
comments on youtube videos?

2780
02:41:19,790 --> 02:41:23,960
Is it even 1% yeah,
but what is the number?

2781
02:41:24,290 --> 02:41:28,640
I mean isn't one 10th of 1% is it even
that you could just look at the likes and

2782
02:41:28,641 --> 02:41:32,000
dislikes of every video on that? Pretty
much sums it up. Yeah. Likes and dislikes.

2783
02:41:32,001 --> 02:41:34,940
It's pretty easy, but comments
sometimes they're interesting.

2784
02:41:34,970 --> 02:41:35,900
Sometimes they're engaged,

2785
02:41:35,901 --> 02:41:39,020
like we talked about that with Lewis
from unbox therapy that sometimes he gets

2786
02:41:39,230 --> 02:41:41,570
people that are like really knowledgeable
and are interesting and they have

2787
02:41:41,571 --> 02:41:42,830
discussions the in the Commons,

2788
02:41:43,010 --> 02:41:46,310
but it's the shit like on Floyd Bay where
they're talking about his girlfriend.

2789
02:41:46,311 --> 02:41:50,390
I was like, whoa. Not
just jealous, hateful.

2790
02:41:50,391 --> 02:41:52,730
And they're also,
they're there.

2791
02:41:52,760 --> 02:41:55,520
They're giving in to their situation.

2792
02:41:55,760 --> 02:42:00,760
They're giving in to that this guy is
rich and famous and a superstar and

2793
02:42:00,921 --> 02:42:05,180
successful and I am less,
I will never be in his position,

2794
02:42:05,181 --> 02:42:07,850
so I want to take free shots of him.
I'm going to throw away

2795
02:42:07,910 --> 02:42:09,620
rocks.
They would never say that in his face.

2796
02:42:09,621 --> 02:42:12,260
Looks like when they was going
around saying columby say baby. Yeah.

2797
02:42:12,410 --> 02:42:15,980
Who the fuck are you to tell it to be and
say that baby is more Richard than all

2798
02:42:15,981 --> 02:42:18,550
you motherfuckers. I know if that
made me want to have nappy hair,

2799
02:42:18,570 --> 02:42:22,220
her parents were on having that baby hair
was nappy or whatever you want to call

2800
02:42:22,221 --> 02:42:26,150
it. She still look better
than y'all fucking baby. Who
was born on Medicaid Bitch?

2801
02:42:27,290 --> 02:42:30,200
Well, again, if the baby
wasn't born on Medicaid,

2802
02:42:30,201 --> 02:42:33,070
your argument is it valid and then you
don't know what the fuck you talking.

2803
02:42:34,170 --> 02:42:37,390
Exactly. I mean, people pick at
people. They don't realize that you,

2804
02:42:37,420 --> 02:42:39,680
when you say stuff like that,
they can hear it.

2805
02:42:39,850 --> 02:42:42,720
Well, it's just, it's stupid. It's
just stupid. It's a, it's, it's a,

2806
02:42:42,840 --> 02:42:45,130
it's a situation that's
never supposed to happen.

2807
02:42:45,400 --> 02:42:47,770
Human beings are supposed to
communicate with each other.

2808
02:42:47,950 --> 02:42:50,700
They're not supposed to just communicate.
And when you just communicate,

2809
02:42:50,710 --> 02:42:52,600
no one's there.
And you could just say whatever you want.

2810
02:42:52,601 --> 02:42:55,030
There's no repercussions.
You're in an echo chamber.

2811
02:42:55,120 --> 02:42:59,230
You don't even have the fucking name
that you have. Like your, your 69 eat me.

2812
02:42:59,440 --> 02:43:01,000
That's your youtube name,
you know.

2813
02:43:01,150 --> 02:43:05,740
So 69 eat me has all these things that
they say and they can say fucked up shit

2814
02:43:05,741 --> 02:43:08,680
on every video they find online.
They're not even a real person.

2815
02:43:08,860 --> 02:43:11,830
And they could have 20 of those names.
They could do whatever want they got.

2816
02:43:11,831 --> 02:43:12,760
Situation

2817
02:43:13,030 --> 02:43:16,840
doesn't exist in nature, but it
doesn't mean that people are fucked up.

2818
02:43:16,990 --> 02:43:20,460
It means that there's an avenue for
fucked up people to express themselves.

2819
02:43:20,461 --> 02:43:22,390
It didn't exist before and
there's evidence of that.

2820
02:43:22,690 --> 02:43:26,560
I had a fat girl one time I was on Bob
and Tom and I said some stuff like,

2821
02:43:26,590 --> 02:43:30,130
oh my [inaudible] Dadada, you know,
I don't like being fat or fat.

2822
02:43:30,131 --> 02:43:33,820
Girls like to eat all the time. So this
lady sent me like all along as EMA,

2823
02:43:33,830 --> 02:43:37,870
how dare you talk about the fat girl and
why is you on their clansmen show with

2824
02:43:37,871 --> 02:43:41,080
them? White Dude. Hey you
did and fat girls all six.

2825
02:43:41,081 --> 02:43:43,240
And she sent me all these fucking coupons.

2826
02:43:43,420 --> 02:43:47,910
Then she sent me all these fucking a
little things for clothes or fat girls all

2827
02:43:47,911 --> 02:43:52,670
on was fucking leper and I don't put
on no leopard anyway and bird tigered.

2828
02:43:52,750 --> 02:43:54,580
That's what fed girls
were lepers in Tongan.

2829
02:43:54,581 --> 02:43:56,150
They want him to look like
animals so you can shoot it.

2830
02:43:57,280 --> 02:43:58,530
I saw

2831
02:44:02,010 --> 02:44:05,590
why they always were leopard. You look
at line Brian and national stores,

2832
02:44:05,591 --> 02:44:09,370
they always fuck everything is animal
print. I think they trying to kill us.

2833
02:44:11,320 --> 02:44:16,280
I don't want to shit, I went black.
Okay, big. Okay. So look at big girl,

2834
02:44:16,630 --> 02:44:20,200
big girl. I'm telling you did. She
sent me to his jumper and she was like,

2835
02:44:20,201 --> 02:44:24,280
big girls are sexy and so I was going
to tear her ass up and my husband talked

2836
02:44:24,281 --> 02:44:24,880
me out of it.

2837
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:28,990
Well you need to do is you need to write
a bit about big girls and I do have a

2838
02:44:28,991 --> 02:44:33,890
baby. You have a bit about that? Yeah.
You'd need, I need to hear that bit. Yeah,

2839
02:44:34,270 --> 02:44:38,420
true.
I told girl leopard titties

2840
02:44:41,050 --> 02:44:45,940
everything. Teigel and animals and
Zebra. Zebra pants. Why is that?

2841
02:44:46,180 --> 02:44:49,090
I don't know why they think we want
to look like a bear or some shit.

2842
02:44:51,910 --> 02:44:52,743
I say

2843
02:44:57,750 --> 02:45:00,670
that is a weird thing.
Maybe it's like an attempt,

2844
02:45:00,671 --> 02:45:03,730
an appeal at the animalistic active.

2845
02:45:04,380 --> 02:45:07,010
I don't buy Leopard
panties. I don't. Okay.

2846
02:45:09,130 --> 02:45:12,490
Want to see my big [inaudible] walk around
or leopard pants and no leopard bra.

2847
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:14,460
And then I got stomach
hanging over the front of it.

2848
02:45:14,470 --> 02:45:18,910
And you don't want to see
that shit. No, no. I don't buy
like, like Valentine's Day.

2849
02:45:18,911 --> 02:45:23,830
Look, Valentine's Day. It always
are pink and red leper, lingerie,

2850
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:28,400
lingerie for fat girls. I'm
not putting myself in that
shit. I'm, I'm not doing it.

2851
02:45:28,490 --> 02:45:29,323
No lingerie

2852
02:45:30,470 --> 02:45:34,930
tee shirt. Okay. I'm with my
panties on. I'll be angry at me. Oh,

2853
02:45:35,400 --> 02:45:39,330
I'm passing lingerie party when I lost
my virginity and the graveyard, I'm done.

2854
02:45:39,660 --> 02:45:43,500
Lingerie is over. No senior husband
lose all this weight and go vegan.

2855
02:45:43,501 --> 02:45:46,590
Does that make you want to do
anything? Yeah, but I'm lazy.

2856
02:45:48,330 --> 02:45:51,870
You got to know your boundaries.
I'm like, I need a sponsor. Y'All

2857
02:45:54,400 --> 02:45:55,610
lazy cause you hustle.

2858
02:45:55,960 --> 02:45:57,780
Awesome. My ass off. So how was that?

2859
02:45:58,230 --> 02:46:01,500
Everybody got their one thing that
they can accomplish, read off.

2860
02:46:01,710 --> 02:46:03,990
And that for me is losing without,

2861
02:46:04,050 --> 02:46:07,470
I just lost 30 pounds on
nutrisystem and so you know what?

2862
02:46:07,950 --> 02:46:10,820
I don't have $300 this month.
I quit.

2863
02:46:11,420 --> 02:46:13,970
That's fucking nutrisystem
food is still at the house.

2864
02:46:13,971 --> 02:46:17,090
I went straight to chick filet. What
is nutrisystem? How's that work?

2865
02:46:17,150 --> 02:46:22,150
They send you like healthy foods and
meals and it works if you can afford it.

2866
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:29,390
And I could afford, I think
weight watchers. Have you
ever tried weight watchers?

2867
02:46:30,140 --> 02:46:33,260
I can't count and I'll fucking points.
I'm busy. Nobody haven't. Yeah,

2868
02:46:34,620 --> 02:46:38,230
I've got a GED. I can't keep up with
that kind of shit. I just move my knees.

2869
02:46:38,810 --> 02:46:40,920
I just move my knees
and her four kids ain't,

2870
02:46:40,940 --> 02:46:43,790
I ain't got time to be killing shit.
I can't do that.

2871
02:46:43,791 --> 02:46:45,320
I need some you can pop in a microwave,

2872
02:46:45,360 --> 02:46:47,450
eat it and they ain't
gone about your business.

2873
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:51,450
Yeah. But if you had like,
this is what I believe,

2874
02:46:51,451 --> 02:46:53,910
I believe that you're going to be very
successful. That's what I believe.

2875
02:46:53,940 --> 02:46:57,660
Absolutely. You're going to have crazy,
crazy money. And uh, when you do,

2876
02:46:57,661 --> 02:46:59,980
are you going to get like
a private chat trying

2877
02:47:01,890 --> 02:47:03,720
to cook you like healthy meals and then

2878
02:47:03,850 --> 02:47:07,200
I'm a ring a bell
thousand calories.

2879
02:47:07,320 --> 02:47:11,070
Miss Pat shrivel up or are we going to
see miss pat say thank you very much.

2880
02:47:11,071 --> 02:47:14,430
The healthy meal and you shut your door
and bolt it and then pull a drawer out

2881
02:47:14,431 --> 02:47:18,360
from underneath your bed and
you start stacking cakes.

2882
02:47:21,180 --> 02:47:22,900
Snickers bars.
No,

2883
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:26,450
I can get half of my
sixth grade figure back.

2884
02:47:26,840 --> 02:47:31,580
Hell had just fun. I used to
be 140 pounds. Wow. Oh God.

2885
02:47:31,581 --> 02:47:34,940
And Nice round titties and both nipples.
That was the good old days.

2886
02:47:36,610 --> 02:47:39,640
Yes. Slowly work your way back
to that. We can make this happen.

2887
02:47:40,020 --> 02:47:40,880
What is he going to do?

2888
02:47:42,620 --> 02:47:47,450
Is eat healthy? It does. You
know, I was eating healthy.

2889
02:47:47,451 --> 02:47:51,530
Then I moved my niece, my
niece was homeless with four
keys. She's 23 years old.

2890
02:47:51,770 --> 02:47:55,310
So I said, okay. I raised her for 10 years
and Mama can't make a fucked up. I like,

2891
02:47:55,430 --> 02:47:56,800
so I went home for Christmas,

2892
02:47:56,960 --> 02:48:01,460
I fucking got my niece for kids
and I just started back eating.

2893
02:48:01,490 --> 02:48:04,640
I was so stressed out. I mean, how do
you bring five people into your house?

2894
02:48:04,850 --> 02:48:09,680
Kids literally had no shoes, no
nothing. And I took everything.

2895
02:48:09,681 --> 02:48:14,200
I had to get these kids back together.
I mean these kids were so behind on these.

2896
02:48:14,270 --> 02:48:19,100
They shot, her four year old was
getting newborn shots. Oh my God.

2897
02:48:19,340 --> 02:48:22,640
So I had, I mean I think that that
brought on a lot of stress and I was like,

2898
02:48:22,641 --> 02:48:23,400
fuck it.
I'm just gonna

2899
02:48:23,400 --> 02:48:27,330
start making sure, I'm sure.
Yeah, stress is a fucker.

2900
02:48:27,331 --> 02:48:28,530
And when you hit stress,

2901
02:48:28,531 --> 02:48:31,200
the first thing you do when
you hit like a real bad patch,

2902
02:48:31,201 --> 02:48:34,980
just to go back to whatever comforts
you. Yeah. For some people it's food.

2903
02:48:34,981 --> 02:48:38,280
For some people at cigarettes, for
some people it's booze, you know,

2904
02:48:38,490 --> 02:48:42,330
and I need to lose weight. Oh my God, I
just lost a hundred pounds. We'll do Liz.

2905
02:48:42,340 --> 02:48:46,410
Jess, too funny. We got to
keep you healthy. Yeah, right.
We got to keep you healthy.

2906
02:48:46,440 --> 02:48:49,110
I won't drop dead. When are you back
here again? We've got to do this again.

2907
02:48:49,111 --> 02:48:52,440
We ran out of time. We just have
three hours. Oh, we did? Yup. Fuck.

2908
02:48:52,441 --> 02:48:55,020
