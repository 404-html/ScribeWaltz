1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,250
Do.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,170
We are here live with Kurt Metzger,

3
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,480
the president of the
Donald Trump fan club,

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,270
and he's got to let us
know about the campaign.

5
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:12,300
Hopeful and exactly what's going
to happen with Mr. Trump wants,

6
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:14,070
he becomes president curb.

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,240
Uh,

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,190
I'm all for Trump.

9
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:17,024
President is going to,

10
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:17,521
what'd he say?

11
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:18,340
He's going to be the,

12
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,870
the biggest economic turnaround.

13
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,030
Big Promises.

14
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,540
He got fired from NBC
men to hear about that.

15
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,011
He's so,

16
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:26,760
and Donald Trump,

17
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,653
he got fired.

18
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,291
Oh,

19
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,510
for his apprentice sharing show.

20
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:30,931
Yes.

21
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,660
He got fired from the fire and ironic.

22
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:35,340
And for him it is.

23
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,230
He says he's going to sue though.

24
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:38,670
He'll have the last laugh.

25
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,380
Why is he suing them like they fought?

26
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,243
Did they find him for,

27
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:41,670
well,

28
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,160
he made a bunch of disparaging
comments about Mexicans,

29
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,620
about people crossing
the border and it was,

30
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,543
you know,

31
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,620
he just was talking,

32
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,800
he was talking like a,

33
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,550
like a rich guy with a no sense
whatsoever that he can hold it down.

34
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,790
I love that.

35
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,380
Yeah.

36
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:57,841
I was like,

37
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:02,190
I love that bladder where we just
can't like Choli and hide it.

38
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:03,150
You gotta let it out.

39
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:03,721
But,

40
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:04,070
uh,

41
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,000
I'd ever blame like the corporation,

42
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,361
you know,

43
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:08,130
the has to fire whoever for a thing.

44
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:09,960
Like that's what I expect them to do.

45
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,830
It's a business.

46
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,551
You know what I mean?

47
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:13,260
Like I would never have put that on them.

48
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,060
If I got fired from something,

49
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,160
I would like to sue them after that.

50
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,210
Seems fucking a little crazy.

51
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,550
I think he just sues
anybody who gets in his way.

52
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,890
He's a fucking steamroller,

53
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,840
a steam roller of lawsuits when though,

54
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,440
I don't know.

55
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,770
I mean he has a rock solid
contract to sweat TMZ said,

56
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,750
so that's why he's doing it.

57
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,411
Okay.

58
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:32,410
So they do pageants.

59
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,320
So they fired him from that.

60
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:38,820
And then Mexico said that they won't
put a woman in his beauty pageant.

61
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,340
So over ms,

62
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:41,941
what does it miss?

63
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:44,190
Universe is that Miss Universe universe.

64
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,271
So,

65
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:45,700
uh,

66
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,240
it's a rough week for a
fucking multibillionaire.

67
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,530
They have Donald Trump are in
Jada's are like going crazy though.

68
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,131
In Mexico.

69
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:55,020
Everyone's beating like really Trump.

70
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,130
Oh that's hilarious.

71
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:56,311
Yeah,

72
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:56,911
they get mad,

73
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:57,450
man.

74
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:57,740
I don't,

75
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,051
you know,

76
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:58,884
that's not like,

77
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,450
I guess cause I'm going the east coast,

78
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:01,260
it's not like a thing.

79
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,740
Like I don't,

80
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,260
I don't have like any strong
feelings about immigration.

81
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,140
Like I saw,

82
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,800
I didn't even know how to
like Dan Culture on my show.

83
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:08,310
Right.

84
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:08,760
And her,

85
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,570
she wants to about her book Adios
America right about like the illegals are

86
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:13,141
coming and I'm like,

87
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:16,620
I don't really have any like well I
don't give a shit if they come like why

88
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,690
can't we go after their employers?

89
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,711
Yeah.

90
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:20,580
Why can't you?

91
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,001
Why can't,

92
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:21,790
Okay Jane,

93
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,180
why,

94
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,013
why can't you,

95
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,900
what's the thing about
Mexico and the California?

96
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,501
Is it Mexico?

97
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:32,190
You could just drive to and a lot of
people over from Mexico to really,

98
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:33,090
even though you got a good point,

99
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:34,470
there really isn't a place like that.

100
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:36,240
And these coasts except for Cuba,

101
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,860
Cuba's got,

102
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,161
you know,

103
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:39,990
the Miami thing or a,

104
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:40,321
you know,

105
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,150
Miami and Cuba right
next door to each other.

106
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:43,530
And so a lot of Cubans,

107
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,390
did you have friends or like I,

108
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,800
one of my best friends from a college
says do from Peru with telling me how cube

109
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,670
is a utopia.

110
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,020
That was his term.

111
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,780
It is if you like 1950s because yeah,

112
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:59,360
I guess I'd like nobody's on an inner
tube floating to Cuba that I've ever heard

113
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:04,300
of that that's just why I don't buy
well they have some good things,

114
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,090
you know,

115
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,060
they seem to be like really nice people.

116
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,920
They have great sense
of community and family.

117
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,793
Have you ever been there?

118
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,733
No,

119
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,600
but I wish I could tell you why I may go.

120
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,560
Um,

121
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,550
but I'll tell you off here.

122
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,463
Sorry folks.

123
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,303
It's a secret.

124
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,150
Uh,

125
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,660
but,

126
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,540
but you will,

127
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:25,541
you see down there for real is like these
incredibly restored old 1950s American

128
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:26,290
cars.

129
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:26,590
Oh yeah.

130
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,270
Cause that was the last
time they were getting cars,

131
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:28,931
so,

132
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:29,201
right.

133
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:29,441
Yeah.

134
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,191
Look at all these cars.

135
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:31,024
This is Cuba.

136
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,140
Like this is like,

137
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,651
oh,

138
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:36,780
I can finally fill my fifties a musical.

139
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,710
I don't know how they're doing this.

140
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,101
Well,

141
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:39,880
you know what,

142
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,240
that's really odd.

143
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,070
He's or how they make sure that
these bodies stay restored.

144
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:46,650
If there remanufacturing,

145
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:46,840
I'm,

146
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,980
I don't know how they're doing that.

147
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,180
Like some old cars,

148
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:53,260
they take like some old cars and then
people will make new body parts for those

149
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:53,711
old cars.

150
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:54,880
Cars are meeting people.

151
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,900
Joke did you knew why?

152
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,610
But look at this.

153
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,211
This is cube.

154
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:01,060
I mean there's a few new cars in there
and the one on the left hand side,

155
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:02,410
but there's a lot of this man.

156
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,940
That's cool cause weird.

157
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:04,250
Right?

158
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,660
You said you're going for sex stories.

159
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,010
Him Jesus Carp match skirt.

160
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,150
I don't know.

161
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,960
Um,

162
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,141
yeah.

163
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:15,340
I don't know how long that looks
fucking kind of cool actually.

164
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,100
How long have they been
using these old cars?

165
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,930
Like that is older than the embargo.

166
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:20,440
Right?

167
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,650
The embargo happened in the sixties
three really built on back then.

168
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,260
You know what I'm saying?

169
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,240
So like these are really old cars though.

170
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,650
Like that up on top.

171
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:32,770
I think that's a 57 or 56 Chevy.

172
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,950
That blue one to the to the middle there.

173
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,620
Yeah.

174
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,970
I'm pretty sure that's a 50s like a late
50s car like that taxi looks like at

175
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,710
the morgue and mini mini chair.

176
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,880
That's a real tax.

177
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:43,714
The Egg,

178
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,290
the Nanu Nanu egg in 1952 Oldsmobile.

179
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,280
Wow.

180
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,400
So there are a few like see this
fairly modern cars in the background.

181
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,240
It's a modern truck,

182
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,150
but I guess you see a
lot of these old cars.

183
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,550
It's kind of wild man

184
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,420
time machine.

185
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:00,760
You know,

186
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,750
if you go back there,

187
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,590
Dick Charles,

188
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,290
cool.

189
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,310
Well they're all cool,

190
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,780
but they're driving them.

191
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,070
It's like driving a living room.

192
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,933
There were hardened.

193
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,840
They're just the dumbest fucking,

194
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,460
the dumbest shape ever
for like getting around.

195
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,170
I think that fucking Fiat,

196
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,210
this stupid shape that you got commercial.

197
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,010
Yeah.

198
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,090
He's running like the
women want to fuck it.

199
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,010
It's the dumbest,

200
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,480
it's shaped like the ropes.

201
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,950
They have weird commercials.

202
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,730
Their commercials almost always involve
fucking remember one time there was a

203
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,850
kid in the backseat and all the bras
and all the girls getting changed in the

204
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:36,430
front seat and all the bras and
everything of flying on him and he's just

205
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:36,821
sitting there.

206
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:37,111
Yeah,

207
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:37,331
yeah,

208
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:37,840
yeah,

209
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,031
yeah.

210
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:38,141
I,

211
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:38,650
you know,

212
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,430
I'm fucking hate those commercials for
the same reason you would read like a

213
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:45,100
feminist blog hating that
commercial pub for a different,

214
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:46,000
like I hate it too,

215
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:48,250
but I think they hate it for a reason.

216
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,360
Different than my reason.

217
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,930
Right.

218
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,890
I'm insulted by it.

219
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,130
They hate it because
it's objectifying women.

220
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:57,980
It's all women are just there
to be sexual play things and

221
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,350
throw their bra and your
face while they're driving.

222
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:00,750
Yeah,

223
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,730
I know the difference.

224
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,470
I everybody really believes that
that really changes you so much.

225
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:10,490
Like the little extra extraneous shit
that you look at changes your perceptions.

226
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,160
It bothers me cause I resent
the idea that I would just,

227
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,681
Oh tits.

228
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:14,271
It's all okay,

229
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,960
I'll buy it off the boat.

230
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,000
It's like,

231
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,610
that's annoying to me that
someone would think I was at dumb,

232
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,893
but uh,

233
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,370
I don't understand the object.

234
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,761
You know,

235
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,050
it's the worst objectification.

236
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,891
Those fucking,

237
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:25,460
uh,

238
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,620
like top 10 worst beach body lists.

239
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,933
You've seen that shit.

240
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,930
That ain't for men.

241
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,543
Who's reading that?

242
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,301
That's when my girlfriend,

243
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:32,510
like,

244
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,811
which,

245
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,640
which girl has the shitty his body.

246
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,830
I would never even look
at a list like that.

247
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,290
How is me like the Burger commercials?

248
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,124
Like nicer,

249
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,993
you know?

250
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,240
Unless there's someone on there
that you used to think was hot,

251
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,800
then you might check out,

252
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,630
see how far the slide has gone.

253
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:47,810
Like,

254
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,080
Ooh,

255
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,913
you might look,

256
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,300
you might look in a train wreck way.

257
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,021
But yeah,

258
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:52,040
those things are for women,

259
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:52,970
you know?

260
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,620
But it's some women,

261
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,910
it doesn't mean define like,

262
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,780
it's like if you're creating characters
for fiction and the idea that you can't

263
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:01,190
create a con,

264
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,120
you know,

265
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,380
you can't make a slot.

266
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,720
You can't make a girl who's
all fucked up in the head.

267
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,031
Well they,

268
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:07,220
they exist in life.

269
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,080
Okay.

270
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,140
And if you're making fiction,

271
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:12,830
your fiction doesn't necessarily have to
represent anything other than what's in

272
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:13,460
your head.

273
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,470
What's the wacky story
you're trying to get out?

274
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,110
You don't have any obligation to
use a certain amount of Asians.

275
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:20,960
You don't have any obligation to use a
certain amount of white people or black

276
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:21,530
people.

277
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,380
Your obligation is to
make something cool up,

278
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,250
make it up,

279
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,083
pull it out of your head.

280
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,990
Well look,

281
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,060
people will worry about
entertainment like that.

282
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,900
That's a very good,

283
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:30,770
when I was religious,

284
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:33,200
that was our one of the
Jehovah's Witness Dude.

285
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:36,220
Like every fucking thing
I watched like smart,

286
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,440
like smurfs was off limits for
some fucking bullshit reason.

287
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:39,740
Right.

288
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,060
They wouldn't let you watch the SMURFS.

289
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:41,541
Yeah.

290
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:41,961
I mean,

291
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,800
so why it really,

292
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:43,221
but there's,

293
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:46,340
I don't know where there's some demonic
thing with that and it's all these

294
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:46,761
fucking,

295
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:47,031
and then,

296
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:47,150
uh,

297
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,020
I remember that as Simpson,

298
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,190
somebody came in and gave a talk,

299
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:50,180
brother Tucker,

300
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,014
his name was,

301
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,390
he was like the traveling
overseer was his title.

302
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,140
Alright.

303
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,540
And he would come and like
give talks in the congregation.

304
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,310
I was in meetings like
three nights a week.

305
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,380
So he gave this whole fucking talk about
all this shit that like how he t was

306
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:04,700
bad because he,

307
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:05,000
yeah,

308
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,010
cause he healed the boy and you're like,

309
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:07,161
you know,

310
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,380
who do we know is the
only person who can heal?

311
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,580
Like I might start believing
ut is the real Jesus.

312
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,563
That's the fear.

313
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,990
And then the Simpsons had
rebellion against authority
with bar and disrespect of

314
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:21,200
like your elders.

315
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,340
So that's so I could hear the mother's,

316
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:23,800
well,

317
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,890
I'm not like my kid.

318
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:25,370
Watch it.

319
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,020
I could hear them chattering after that.

320
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,910
Like that's what the shit is now.

321
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:29,744
It's like what is,

322
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,010
what's the representation?

323
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,090
It's not propaganda.

324
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,670
So Shit,

325
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,500
just candy.

326
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,100
You know?

327
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,340
So we were talking about
this before the podcast to,

328
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:41,350
do you think that some like overtly upset
PC people that what they're doing is

329
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:48,371
almost like a form of like protecting
lord almost like a form of fighting

330
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:53,080
against blasphemy charge my church,

331
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,530
I remember all of them that were like,

332
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:58,860
oh well you something like every
lunch with that same behavior.

333
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,150
I believe that 100% I think you're right.

334
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,310
What is the exact same thing?

335
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,143
Yeah.

336
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,751
I don't even listen.

337
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,584
I don't even mind them.

338
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,240
As long as you act trying to get me fired.

339
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:06,730
I don't want,

340
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,800
you can say whatever,

341
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,250
you know,

342
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,240
but if you want to criticize,

343
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,040
I'm not against criticism.

344
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,351
Right,

345
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:11,610
right.

346
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,181
That's fine.

347
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,730
Just do I have to be fired?

348
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,090
Just can we not do that part of it?

349
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:15,721
Well that,

350
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:15,930
that,

351
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,130
that is where you find out like
exactly what kind of people they are.

352
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,170
Like what exactly are
they trying to accomplish?

353
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,380
Are they trying to engage in
discourse with a reasonable person?

354
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,340
You're reasonable guy,

355
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,870
you'll have conversations with people,

356
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,430
but that's the thing they
want you instantly labeled
as an unreasonable person

357
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,840
who is not to be debated.

358
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,351
Well,

359
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:35,610
you shouldn't even have to bring it up.

360
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:37,140
You should just know what
the right thing is to do.

361
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,590
Remember the Anti Seinfeld like,

362
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:40,760
well,

363
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,011
you know,

364
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:41,844
so I felt,

365
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,191
by the way,

366
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:43,200
Chris Rock said the same thing,

367
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,500
right?

368
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:43,690
Yeah.

369
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,430
About what college is.

370
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,300
But he's allowed to,

371
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,381
yeah.

372
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:47,400
That was not sent in.

373
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:49,500
Seinfeld come down and it's like,

374
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:49,651
well,

375
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:52,180
he's irrelevant and an old man something,

376
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,220
which by the way,

377
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,750
that's like saying someone's fat.

378
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,850
Yeah.

379
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,220
Like what?

380
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,750
I don't see the difference in Ad Hominem.

381
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,141
Right?

382
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:58,290
Yeah.

383
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,880
I mean it's diffusing his,

384
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:01,650
his argument and what he's saying is,

385
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:01,861
you know,

386
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:05,820
with Jerry Seinfeld was saying was that
the colleges are too PC and they'll call

387
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:06,750
you on everything.

388
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:07,670
And then with his daughter,

389
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,550
they don't even know what the fuck these
words mean and what constitutes that.

390
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,170
And that's exactly right.

391
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,110
I don't think that PC ruins comedy.

392
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:17,040
Like people who are funny.

393
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:17,790
It's still funny.

394
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,740
It kind of fucks up audiences.

395
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:20,430
Right?

396
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,690
So we both,

397
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,940
I have the same goals.

398
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,730
One of these PCP,

399
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,400
like I think people treat be more
sensitive to each other and all that shit.

400
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:26,700
Right?

401
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,570
I do as well.

402
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,970
But their system is not
going to create that.

403
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:33,020
Just going to create fucking
people that shut down at buzzwords.

404
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,450
Right.

405
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,620
So that's not helping.

406
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,270
It's not accomplishing anything.

407
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:37,410
It's also a game.

408
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,921
There's like a,

409
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,900
there's a total that's being run.

410
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:40,571
Yeah.

411
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:44,340
And one side people trying to catch
you for things they can catch you with.

412
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,120
And it was just like what happens with
cops when you started giving cops the

413
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,320
ability to start right now?

414
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:53,820
Tickets and you give them the ability to
play this game and this game is to try

415
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,110
to get the bad guy.

416
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,281
You're in it,

417
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,160
you're involved in a game when
you're in a game with them too.

418
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:00,660
And their game is to get offended,

419
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,040
right.

420
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,750
Find some shit to get offended
and then they find it.

421
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,650
I got one,

422
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:05,940
I fucking gotten one.

423
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,050
And they get that one.

424
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,520
They want to parade that one out.

425
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:09,990
They want to publicly shame.

426
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,480
It's like game of Thrones,

427
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,520
shame,

428
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,240
shame.

429
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,110
That's what they're doing.

430
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:16,990
It's like a,

431
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,530
it's like talking to bill
collectors to near like watch.

432
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,300
Please don't swear sir.

433
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:23,880
Oh,

434
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,840
I can't help you with him.

435
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,930
I think I said like scumbag about,

436
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:28,950
it's unbelievable.

437
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,770
Watch your language,

438
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,580
sir.

439
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,413
That's like that.

440
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,820
That's just an easy out.

441
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,200
That's a grocer.

442
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,730
I like it.

443
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,560
I,

444
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,410
I can be reasoned with.

445
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,850
So what with some of his
argument that talks to me.

446
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,860
I'm not in trenched.

447
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,410
You understand?

448
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,243
So just,

449
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,390
if you're going to educate me,

450
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:42,691
do it.

451
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:42,881
I'll,

452
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:43,714
I'll listen to you.

453
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,390
You were involved in something like that.

454
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,630
W W w what was going on where someone was
trying to fire you for something from,

455
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,633
uh,

456
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,963
there's uh,

457
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,540
this,

458
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:51,721
uh,

459
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:52,320
what do you call it?

460
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,470
Remember Sam Morel?

461
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,113
That it was like,

462
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,480
it was,

463
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,740
it was the great rape joke.

464
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,030
Or if a 2012,

465
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,140
this is a great big chunk,

466
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,730
that whole fucking thing.

467
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,020
Daniel tosh thing.

468
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,381
Yeah.

469
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:04,420
So it was so Sam morale,

470
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,673
Yusef had show,

471
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,320
uh,

472
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,260
but he was having sex with his
woman is making them realize,

473
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,650
oh,

474
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,790
he's having sex is black homie.

475
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,870
I was making him really uncomfortable.

476
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:12,970
She kept using the n word and he goes,

477
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:13,340
you know,

478
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,200
no.

479
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,710
Right.

480
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,170
So somebody would a
whole article about that.

481
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,500
So the jokes like whatever,

482
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,481
throw a joke.

483
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:21,880
But there was a whole thing
about how fucking terrible he is.

484
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,330
So I did a thing with him where we said
the person that wrote this article is

485
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:28,360
not a real person.

486
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,081
Okay.

487
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,890
And when she was something we invented
to make some points about free speech,

488
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,990
and I had a couple people
on Facebook say like,

489
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:35,200
oh,

490
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,070
the Jig is up.

491
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,580
And so it's spread pretty
quick that she's not real.

492
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,503
Okay.

493
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,310
And she got fucking furious from that.

494
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,040
So she went through my whole Facebook and,

495
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:45,874
uh,

496
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,871
by the way,

497
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:47,111
like,

498
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,250
don't go on my Facebook.

499
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,870
I can't say that enough to people.

500
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:50,021
Like,

501
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,520
I don't need you and it's not good.

502
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,153
She went through,

503
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,550
she went through every post she could
find to just cut and paste shit out of

504
00:12:57,551 --> 00:12:58,384
context.

505
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,240
Clearly Jim made a collage out of it,

506
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,250
which it's pretty awesome actually.

507
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,170
Like it looked pretty cool and uh,

508
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,600
had this thing and get me fucked,

509
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,600
but I was going to get fired,

510
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:08,740
but I had to have like,

511
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
I'd like call my PR,

512
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,440
have a call from my producer and shit.

513
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,740
I never even quaded my
job with any of this.

514
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,790
You know what I mean?

515
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,301
That was like,

516
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:16,511
well,

517
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:19,870
I'm dumb because I didn't realize
that would spill over into my,

518
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,591
you know,

519
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,610
my day job.

520
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:21,821
Well,

521
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:25,360
the fact that she's got the kind of time
to do that to someone who criticizes

522
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:27,100
her or makes like a little mock,

523
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,830
well she has a borderline per,

524
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,300
she has a mental illness,

525
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,800
like they should be committed for,

526
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,670
which I need to know.

527
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,690
I wouldn't even made a joke,

528
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,760
like I probably just like
a beautiful mind for her,

529
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,363
but I did that.

530
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,750
If I knew she had that,

531
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:41,584
I wouldn't have done that.

532
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:41,781
Oh,

533
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:42,220
right.

534
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,090
She has something wrong with her.

535
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:44,830
So people with that disorder,

536
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,270
borderline personality disorder,

537
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:49,600
they take shit way harder
than like regular folks.

538
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,050
Yeah.

539
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,920
So you did it in response for this
guy getting raked over the coals.

540
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,410
Jealous that he was getting attention.

541
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,820
That's a stupid I am.

542
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,221
I was like,

543
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:02,140
I have the offensive where's money thing?

544
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,570
So then I got my way to the next level.

545
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,310
You create you a so what was the wood?

546
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:10,840
Was the like the most
heinous infraction that you,

547
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:11,674
uh,

548
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,910
you were killing so much

549
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,130
shit,

550
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:15,963
Lord.

551
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,983
Uh,

552
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:17,501
no,

553
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:18,140
but you know what the,

554
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,830
it's called the,

555
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,210
uh,

556
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,520
the disturbing online
trail of Kurt Metzger.

557
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,091
Oh,

558
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:23,470
that's what it really does.

559
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,201
The name of the article.

560
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:24,990
Online trade.

561
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,720
It's like,

562
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,920
it's a real smear job,

563
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,773
dude.

564
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,630
I was shocked how like
smeary it was where I'm like,

565
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:32,020
wow,

566
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,950
you really manage it.

567
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,933
But I'd still,

568
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,893
wherever I go,

569
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,753
kind of funny.

570
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,131
But was like,

571
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:39,880
they still didn't even in the
effort to make it like bad,

572
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,470
but it's still the most unfair.

573
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:43,510
I can't even believe the amount of like,

574
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,010
like bullshit.

575
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,450
So it's pretty easy or somebody doing it.

576
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,880
And I think still to
this day I'll get random.

577
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,160
Like people are angry at me
and to this day from that.

578
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,300
That's hilarious.

579
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,481
Yeah.

580
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:55,940
So it's like it can
affect you some something.

581
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,560
I know it's affected me somehow.

582
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,210
This bullshit fucking article.

583
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,260
Only in good ways.

584
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,310
Uh,

585
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,820
anybody that it gets offended by that
you didn't want him in the first place.

586
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,020
Anybody that can't see,

587
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,460
he can't like read through that and go,

588
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:07,670
wait,

589
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,480
what's going on here?

590
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,891
What is the,

591
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:09,620
the whole story.

592
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,480
Oh Oh they are mocking you.

593
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:14,240
And they said you weren't a
real person like you were.

594
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,710
You were a parody account.

595
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,420
Yeah I know you're angry.

596
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,220
Well cause people were putting up fake
accounts of her all over the place,

597
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,780
which I didn't tell anyone to do that.

598
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:24,651
And by the way,

599
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:25,580
I repeatedly,

600
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,890
my fucking stupid fans,

601
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,690
I can't ask them enough.

602
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:33,620
Not to like get involved in the thing
you had asked them to not get involved

603
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:36,360
because it's not your say they fall off.

604
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,390
Cause it's funny that in my fucking,

605
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:39,380
but it's not you.

606
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,900
It's fine.

607
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm,

608
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,970
I washed my hands of
you doing anything day.

609
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,300
But she invites that because
what she's doing is online.

610
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,931
This is,

611
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:49,700
this is a totally open arena.

612
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,290
So like for you going to say like,

613
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:51,711
do your friends,

614
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:52,191
like don't,

615
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:53,030
don't give her a hard time.

616
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,830
Why is there a comment section?

617
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,770
Why is there a comment
section and writing nonsense?

618
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,120
Why did you leave a comment section?

619
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,540
Oh,

620
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,540
you're going to heavily edit the
comments section and I don't wanna like I

621
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:05,540
would've,

622
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:05,931
she's like,

623
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,360
somebody would have had them like
show if it hadn't gone to that.

624
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:08,781
You know what I mean?

625
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:09,171
Like I,

626
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:10,610
I don't want to Elian eat to people.

627
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:11,180
I want to get wet,

628
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,371
right.

629
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,204
Ken,

630
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,230
to come on my God damn podcast
because I'm not into like,

631
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,480
I don't,

632
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,430
I'm not trying to like,

633
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,121
what's it called?

634
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:17,570
By the way?

635
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,141
Race wars.

636
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:20,240
This meeting should always small and a,

637
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:22,700
we're going to serious pretty soon
for four weeks for like a trial.

638
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:22,910
But it,

639
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,230
it'll still be a podcast.

640
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,603
But uh,

641
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:25,881
yeah,

642
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:26,360
we have,

643
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,193
I'll have like,

644
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,283
just the whole deal.

645
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,140
It's a website.

646
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,370
Well,

647
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,230
at soundcloud and iTunes
you can get it on.

648
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,780
Okay.

649
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,300
And the last one we had,

650
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,440
Ann Coulter,

651
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,650
the managing editor of jazz rebel,

652
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,150
Jesus Christ girl,

653
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:42,200
Carolyn Castiglia,

654
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,850
who's a comic who like eight life,

655
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:44,770
she would,

656
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:44,891
you know,

657
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:45,410
it was great.

658
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:45,591
It was,

659
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:47,000
it was one of the best episodes.

660
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,550
I had a fucking slam poetry contest.

661
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,170
Really a slam poetry.

662
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,670
He goes,

663
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,000
dude,

664
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,360
you didn't see the fucking
youtube video of rape joke,

665
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,370
the Ms Slam poetry files.

666
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:58,761
No,

667
00:16:58,761 --> 00:16:59,594
I missed it.

668
00:16:59,760 --> 00:16:59,921
Oh,

669
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:00,441
it was brutal.

670
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:00,681
Do it.

671
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:01,220
Is it?

672
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,750
It's these two girls doing,

673
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:03,080
uh,

674
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,610
like each one says the next line kind of
slam po that they rehearsed their like

675
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,444
knock knock.

676
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,060
Who's there raped?

677
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,353
Wait,

678
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,280
what is this?

679
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,120
Is it a rape jokes?

680
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:15,020
Not fucking funny.

681
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,520
The crowd goes nuts.

682
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,361
It's no,

683
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:18,051
it's a real thing.

684
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:18,884
It's like slang.

685
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,420
If you go on upworthy,

686
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:25,070
that's what they love is like slam
poetry slam or what is upworthy?

687
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,060
You've never been on there?

688
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,690
No,

689
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,410
seriously.

690
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:32,310
It's like things you're supposed
to seems familiar to dig.

691
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,290
It's like a,

692
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,910
he was like an upworthy title.

693
00:17:34,911 --> 00:17:39,050
Like this video of elephants getting
married will blow your mind and then you

694
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:41,720
see the like a little short
clip or else it's like this,

695
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,020
this little transgendered
girl explains it all,

696
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,840
blew me away.

697
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,411
You know,

698
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:49,980
like those are all the headlines and then

699
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,070
you're not doing shit
on Facebook where it,

700
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,411
yeah.

701
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:53,280
I hate that crap.

702
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,210
Where it says something like,

703
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,790
you won't believe what happens next
when this topic comes home from,

704
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:57,091
no,

705
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:57,301
no,

706
00:17:57,301 --> 00:17:57,511
no,

707
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:57,661
no.

708
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:58,680
You don't understand Brian.

709
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,950
This,

710
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,540
it's like super lefty,

711
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,790
but this is like my old religious
jove [inaudible] literature.

712
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,653
But here's why,

713
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,011
you know,

714
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,090
celebrate diversity.

715
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:09,930
Don't squash it.

716
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:11,670
Here's why the president is wrong.

717
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:12,720
Like those kind of questions,

718
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:13,110
right?

719
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,950
Or those kinds of tasks.

720
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:16,190
A little bit more thoughtful
than the titles I would think.

721
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,861
But there's like,

722
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:17,340
you know,

723
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,310
Kurt Metzger is evil and,

724
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,450
and a problem for America.

725
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,460
Here's what's wrong with his comedy.

726
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,930
That's too specific.

727
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:25,640
No,

728
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,490
they're misleading.

729
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,361
It's always like,

730
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:30,160
get ready to have titles going again.

731
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,320
Going hold that and pull that back.

732
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:31,801
Yeah.

733
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:32,341
It's like all the,

734
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:32,581
it's,

735
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:33,350
it's a bringing,

736
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,100
I looked at one today where it was,

737
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,760
uh,

738
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,340
somebody screen scroll up to this.

739
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,980
Probably a lot of parody
sites of it too by now.

740
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:41,431
Okay.

741
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:44,460
How seven things that have
nothing to do with rape.

742
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:46,860
Perfectly illustrate
the concept of consent.

743
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,630
Wow.

744
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,463
Going to perfectly,

745
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,990
how crazy is that?

746
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:51,480
That the first thing to go to his rape?

747
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:53,820
Just a little bit of
rape obsession going on.

748
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,550
I know,

749
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,490
I know it's an awful heinous crime,

750
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,410
but God damn it comes up a lot,

751
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,220
you know?

752
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,551
I mean,

753
00:18:59,551 --> 00:18:59,851
yeah.

754
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:03,270
I don't think they were wearing
these has to be raised more about it,

755
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,920
but I don't know.

756
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,770
I don't think there's anything
wrong with raising awareness,

757
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,491
but it seems to be,

758
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:10,380
there's like a massive focus on it.

759
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:10,891
Well,

760
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:11,780
you're not going to look,

761
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,870
law enforcement has to do their job,

762
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,560
you know,

763
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:14,761
you know,

764
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:15,541
all of those rape kits,

765
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,171
they have backed up.

766
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:19,740
Like that's fucking a big problem
with grain gets backed up.

767
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,011
Yeah.

768
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,390
Like they haven't checked them.

769
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,051
Yeah.

770
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:23,130
Like lots of the top Jamie.

771
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:26,910
But the things you see now is this idea
that just a little education is going to

772
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:31,560
stop this and you can educate
men not to rape but not a rapist.

773
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,430
That's what they do.

774
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:34,170
You're not going to
educate them out of that.

775
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,720
So that's why law enforcement
supposed to take care of that.

776
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,063
Well,

777
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,740
I mean you don't have
to tell me not to rape.

778
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:41,461
I get it.

779
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:42,450
That's a bad thing to do.

780
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:47,570
I think for sure there's something about
society's attitudes towards it would

781
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,030
make it more instead of teaching
women how to avoid rape,

782
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:52,800
let's raise boys specifically not drape.

783
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,610
Hey,

784
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,443
good luck with that.

785
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,370
That people that do that,

786
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:58,410
I like that pedophiles are like that.

787
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,610
They just come out.

788
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,420
You know what I mean?

789
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:00,670
Well,

790
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,030
they definitely think that
growing up in a certain household,

791
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:05,040
if your household is fucked up and you're,

792
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:05,371
you know,

793
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:09,450
your dad is a just a piece of shit towards
women and you show that you grow up

794
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:09,960
with that,

795
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,910
but you're not going to
change that with a cartoon.

796
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,133
You're just

797
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,340
the website them up.

798
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:15,781
They like,

799
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,040
there's nothing you can
do but lock them up.

800
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,420
But the only way to do it,

801
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,040
it makes any sense at all.

802
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,090
Would it be to somehow or
another raise better kids?

803
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:24,841
You know,

804
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:29,520
you'd have to like figure out how to
engineer that and that is not a small task

805
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:30,930
by any stretch of the imagination.

806
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,280
Maybe we could breed that out.

807
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:33,510
But I'm saying in the meantime,

808
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:38,490
while we're working on that w which
absolutely should happen also watch your

809
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:38,990
back,

810
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,421
you know,

811
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:41,010
until that problem is taken care of.

812
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,380
Like I shouldn't have to
change my bike up either,

813
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:44,110
but that,

814
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,290
uh,

815
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,030
you know,

816
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,590
it could get stolen if I don't.

817
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,210
This is seven things that
have nothing to do with rape.

818
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:51,190
Perfectly illustrate
the concept of consent.

819
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:51,911
It says,

820
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:53,890
want to watch pulp fiction guy says,

821
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:54,610
sure,

822
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,860
half hour later and I'm
not really liking this.

823
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,730
Let's do something else.

824
00:20:57,731 --> 00:20:59,680
And the guy puts his hand on him and says,

825
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:00,430
no.

826
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,670
You said you'd watched the movie
so you're staying till it's done.

827
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,220
So he's gonna fuck that guy.

828
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,701
Basically.

829
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:07,130
No,

830
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:07,870
he's like,

831
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,440
it's like he's raping him by
forcing him to watch a movie.

832
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,840
Any guy that cares about whether
or not you watch a movie,

833
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:14,674
it's going to fuck you.

834
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,410
He's just waiting for
the drugs to take whole.

835
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:21,520
Let's double rape because double rapey
he's movie raping you and real raping

836
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:22,354
you.

837
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,243
Yeah,

838
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,511
he's a rape,

839
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:26,380
rape rapist.

840
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,810
These are all terrible.

841
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,430
Thank you for letting me borrow your car.

842
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:31,121
No problem.

843
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:31,751
The next week,

844
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:32,441
what are you doing?

845
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:33,161
Barring your car?

846
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:36,190
You said I could if anybody
fucks you for a week.

847
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:37,480
That Gosh deserves a trophy.

848
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,290
First of all,

849
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,400
this is a terrible analogy.

850
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,200
You can't take my car,

851
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,220
whatever you want it.

852
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,330
That's bullshit.

853
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,540
You said I could have at once so it
should be able to have it all the time.

854
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,350
Her car policy,

855
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,060
I get it.

856
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,240
It's car pussy and for a week
to do is fucking her for a week.

857
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,680
That's what they're trying to get.

858
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:55,270
You think this guy is so viral?

859
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,540
I don't know.

860
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,380
I can't even read these.

861
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,860
I know it's there.

862
00:21:57,861 --> 00:21:58,030
No,

863
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,361
even like,

864
00:21:58,361 --> 00:21:59,171
can I take anything off?

865
00:21:59,171 --> 00:22:00,430
But they're hurting my brain,

866
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
but it's just such odd.

867
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,960
Who's his message for exactly
who is the message for?

868
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,500
You know?

869
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,280
It's Duh,

870
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,113
it's all de,

871
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:07,720
it's done.

872
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,171
Don't rape,

873
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:08,950
Duh.

874
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,783
Don't be racist.

875
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,631
No more.

876
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:12,880
The the fucking law and order commercial,

877
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,010
all the cast of law and order Svu.

878
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:15,670
Right.

879
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,140
You don't know more sexual assault,

880
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:18,790
which is a good call to stop it.

881
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,210
We're,

882
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:19,451
yeah,

883
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:20,151
we're all for it.

884
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:20,681
We're all for that.

885
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:21,514
They're going to do it.

886
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:21,941
I like,

887
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:22,900
I'm not one of these guys.

888
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:23,440
That's for it.

889
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,273
Okay,

890
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,000
so,

891
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,890
so then their slogans no more.

892
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:28,950
Which if there's one thing
that rapists understands,

893
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,830
just the word no.

894
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,340
So good work with that and then they,

895
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,030
they act like they can't even speak.

896
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:34,864
Did you ever see that?

897
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,960
It's all the actors from
Svu and they just go like,

898
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,323
ah,

899
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,710
no and it cuts the next one and he's like,

900
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:42,340
no,

901
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,940
no.

902
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,840
And they cut to Mariska.

903
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:45,700
Hargitay can we stop?

904
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,833
Can we just stop?

905
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,650
And it says sexual assault
is hard to talk about.

906
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,490
Is it really cast of law and order
Svu during a reap show for 16 years,

907
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,240
they can't bring it up now.

908
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,590
The whole show's rape and murder.

909
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,960
It's just the PME is fucking shit.

910
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,000
And they make money off of
rape and murder on that shit.

911
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:07,300
That's all that shows about
does porn for old people.

912
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,470
That's who watched you said Shit.

913
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:09,490
Oh fuck.

914
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:11,710
They get all titillated by murder shows.

915
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,690
Who's going to see that and just go,

916
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,790
I was going to go and rape and I know.

917
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:16,181
Right.

918
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:17,000
Shit.

919
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,681
All right,

920
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:18,550
Dan Florick

921
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,431
you got me.

922
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:22,000
Fuck.

923
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,170
Yeah.

924
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,440
That didn't help one person.

925
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:23,800
I bet.

926
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,240
No one single person.

927
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,213
Of course not.

928
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,790
None of that works.

929
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,300
You can't just tell people
to not do things well,

930
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,060
no,

931
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,380
they should be an environment.

932
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,580
Here's the thing you work on.

933
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,090
If somebody got raped that they feel
like they can report it like that's what

934
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:37,750
should make.

935
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,230
Yes.

936
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,740
That's the whatever the attitude is
to work on is the whole key to is

937
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,050
everybody's got to report
it when it happens,

938
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:44,920
which some people want.

939
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:45,440
Yeah,

940
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,273
and then,

941
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:46,981
Oh God,

942
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:47,480
what are you saying?

943
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:47,631
No,

944
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:47,921
go ahead.

945
00:23:47,921 --> 00:23:48,230
Yeah.

946
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,420
Well remember Kilstein
was on Disney thing.

947
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:51,850
It drove me nuts when I want to come on.

948
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,320
The show was when he said
rapes worse than murder.

949
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,430
So that's not really helping a victim to
tell them they're better off dead than,

950
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,350
that's not really very kind.

951
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:00,771
Jamie,

952
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:01,604
do you understand?

953
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,780
That's how people don't report their
rate because they'd want to be known as

954
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:08,180
someone that something worse
than murder happened to.

955
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,050
Right.

956
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,441
You know?

957
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:13,430
No one ever stopped any sort of
crime by because of a slogan.

958
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,151
Give a hoot.

959
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:14,751
Don't pollute.

960
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:15,980
Maybe you know,

961
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:16,670
maybe,

962
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,320
maybe only you could fight for as far.

963
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,890
You know,

964
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,500
maybe you stopped some people
with one of those cards.

965
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,850
I think that could work.

966
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:23,684
Don't rape.

967
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:24,351
Hey,

968
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,020
pedophile rape.

969
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,081
Cut it out.

970
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:28,610
Pedos cut.

971
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,380
Stop fucking kids periods off the boys.

972
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:33,500
Let's call what it is.

973
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,810
Stop fucking kids.

974
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,123
They should have like,

975
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:37,720
oh,

976
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,560
we should make like really forceful ads.

977
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:40,880
Hey,

978
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,910
it's not cool to fuck.

979
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,530
Yes.

980
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,700
That would be a great ad.

981
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,940
Just three,

982
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,741
three words.

983
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:47,120
Stop fucking kids.

984
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:47,954
That's the whole ad.

985
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,030
I don't care if it's controversial or not.

986
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:50,780
You got to stop.

987
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,051
Yeah,

988
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:51,884
just stop.

989
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,750
I know you get a rise out of it.

990
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,643
You've got to come get,

991
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,000
he need a hobby.

992
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,760
Can't continue no more.

993
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:00,530
It was only one or two a year,

994
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,393
you know?

995
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,563
No more.

996
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,350
Imagine if you could find a kid
that could keep his mouth shut.

997
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,460
What a gem she found one.

998
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:10,731
Yeah,

999
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:11,564
no more of that.

1000
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,970
If you are a pedophile,

1001
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,910
it's gotta be the life of a pedophile.

1002
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:19,310
It's going to be the most heinous prison.

1003
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,150
Define your mind,

1004
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:20,984
trapped in,

1005
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:21,401
you know,

1006
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:23,000
do you think that's an orientation?

1007
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,751
Being a pedophile?

1008
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:25,880
I literally have zero idea.

1009
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,280
I what I imagine is that like some people
have schizophrenia and some people,

1010
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:32,690
you know,

1011
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:37,040
they develop all sorts of weird mental
disorders and multiple personality

1012
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:37,630
disorder and these are,

1013
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,410
the human brain doesn't always work right.

1014
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,500
I heard schizophrenia is kind of
just a catchall for a bunch of shit.

1015
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,190
You know,

1016
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,023
it's not even,

1017
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,010
I didn't realize how much psychology,

1018
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:46,731
you know,

1019
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:49,490
Scientology like bashes the shit
out of like psychiatry at Lake,

1020
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,060
right?

1021
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,540
They're not like psychiatry.

1022
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:52,760
He's got a lot of bullshit.

1023
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:56,600
I didn't realize compared to medicine
where it's not like they can't really

1024
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:59,030
diagnose shit for real
to a lot of guesswork.

1025
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,923
Did you know that?

1026
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,891
Well they,

1027
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:04,820
I know it in talking to people
that have taken antidepressants,

1028
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,710
that's the take.

1029
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,401
That's the robot.

1030
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:10,650
Dick [inaudible] stick in here.

1031
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,530
Um,

1032
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,560
but Neil Brennan was on the other
day and he was talking about the,

1033
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,500
this is one thing that a lot of people
may not know and I didn't know until I

1034
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:19,910
started talking to people that take them.

1035
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,530
The folks who take Ssri it,

1036
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,110
they don't know like why
these things help people.

1037
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,973
They really don't know.

1038
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,401
Yeah,

1039
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:25,941
I know.

1040
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:28,250
You don't know which one's going to
work on you and they give you a bunch of

1041
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:29,420
different ones to try this one out.

1042
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,080
This isn't work.

1043
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,741
Give me another one.

1044
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:31,400
They give you another one.

1045
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,551
Ooh,

1046
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:32,384
I think we got it.

1047
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,081
And you know,

1048
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:34,670
you've got to figure out
what the dosage is like.

1049
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:35,151
It's not an a,

1050
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:35,330
it's,

1051
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,410
it's a weird,

1052
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:37,550
does that sound right to you?

1053
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,241
I read this.

1054
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:39,380
I don't remember where I read this.

1055
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,670
So it could be just horse shit.

1056
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:41,301
But you know,

1057
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:43,160
people are supposed to
get suicidal on those.

1058
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:43,570
Yeah.

1059
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,390
Sometimes.

1060
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,670
Yeah,

1061
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,630
because some of them,

1062
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,460
this could be wrong,

1063
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,930
but it sounded interesting to me.

1064
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,110
Uh,

1065
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,430
they,

1066
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,960
it kills us anxiety.

1067
00:26:51,961 --> 00:26:52,441
Some of them,

1068
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:53,130
you know,

1069
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,720
you have a certain amount
of anxiety in your,

1070
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:58,260
in your nationally about ending your
life that's just naturally there to keep

1071
00:26:58,261 --> 00:26:59,094
you from doing that.

1072
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,990
And when some of these drugs,

1073
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,630
they even you out so much
where you don't feel that fear.

1074
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:08,220
So if you really thought out your suicide
pretty well now you no longer have the

1075
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:10,620
fear of committing it because you're calm.

1076
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:11,340
So you're like,

1077
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:11,731
oh yeah,

1078
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:12,361
it's no big deal.

1079
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:13,230
You just kill myself.

1080
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,501
Well,

1081
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:16,410
that was the argument for school
shooters and things along those lines.

1082
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,390
I used to believe that too.

1083
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,440
But then I found out when people say
they're not all some somewhere on Xanax,

1084
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,320
so it's not all the same drug.

1085
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:28,260
And that's like the very
catchall that's easy to answer.

1086
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,620
Yeah.

1087
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,270
What I was going to say is that they,

1088
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:31,163
they don't,

1089
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,660
they don't feel anything like they feel,

1090
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,920
it doesn't bother them.

1091
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:38,940
Like I frame it was on Zoloft and the
way she described it was she's like,

1092
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,320
nothing bothered me.

1093
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,610
Like nothing like my,

1094
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,030
you carb beer into flames or whatever.

1095
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,050
Creepy.

1096
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,050
So if you had a desire to
kill someone for some reason,

1097
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:52,770
wouldn't fuck with you the same way
it would if you weren't on something.

1098
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,610
So yes.

1099
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:58,610
So you get someone who's probably
wired wrong anyway for whatever reason.

1100
00:27:58,891 --> 00:27:59,670
Trauma,

1101
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,450
abuse,

1102
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,140
genetics,

1103
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,520
whatever.

1104
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,130
The reason is that someone could become
like that Colorado school shooting guy,

1105
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,600
but he put someone like that on certain
medications and the way it interacts

1106
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:14,430
with your fucked up brain is it allows
you to do heinous shit and not feel

1107
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:15,270
anything about it.

1108
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:16,741
I don't know,

1109
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:17,040
man.

1110
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,873
I don't know either.

1111
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,400
But I mean that's,

1112
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,860
I guess it depends how much of that is
just in you because I thought they calmed

1113
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:24,540
you down too for some people,

1114
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,010
but they have a different
effect on different,

1115
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,670
it's like,

1116
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,940
like those medicines that
they give people for Adhd.

1117
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:30,541
Right.

1118
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:31,321
If you took it,

1119
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:32,154
you'd be like,

1120
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:32,980
Danielle,

1121
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,590
that's what happens when I do take it.

1122
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:34,890
Yeah.

1123
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,230
But if you give them
to kids who have ADHD,

1124
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,910
apparently it calms him down.

1125
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:40,110
He says strange way.

1126
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,730
They like crash or something.

1127
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,900
I don't fucking get it.

1128
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:43,051
You know,

1129
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,220
it was just fucking Meth,

1130
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:44,760
man.

1131
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,080
Wow.

1132
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,380
It's a little different but slightly
that we give to Hitler pills now.

1133
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,241
Hitler did you,

1134
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:51,541
by the way,

1135
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:52,351
did you see,

1136
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:53,490
I think about his Hitler,

1137
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:54,324
the junkie.

1138
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,490
What a history channel.

1139
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,200
It was all about his doctor feelgood.

1140
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,771
Oh,

1141
00:28:58,771 --> 00:28:59,680
he had a doctor feelgood.

1142
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,780
They didn't even know back then.

1143
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,980
People were taking math.

1144
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:05,130
I thought it was like a vitamin is that
it was that he was going to invite a

1145
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:06,450
shot of meth.

1146
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,820
He probably had a lot of energy and
then makes sense if you think about it.

1147
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,340
They used to give that
to the fighter pilots.

1148
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:16,390
Apparently the Germans came up with,

1149
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:16,800
well,

1150
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,000
the kamikaze is take it and they said yes.

1151
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,900
Used to get good dudes to fly
their plane into ships and blow up.

1152
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,990
Turn them in the human torpedoes.

1153
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,180
They apparently they were
using crystal meth or drink.

1154
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:27,901
That's amazing.

1155
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:30,330
They could be that like
sure that their guys like,

1156
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:30,481
uh,

1157
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:30,841
God.

1158
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:32,280
Emperor to do that.

1159
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,600
You know that ball.

1160
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,900
I'm really fucking turn that idea around.

1161
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,743
Holy Shit.

1162
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,953
Yeah,

1163
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,060
I snot God.

1164
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,280
Yeah,

1165
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,240
there is no god.

1166
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,493
Yeah.

1167
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,373
When that happens,

1168
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,790
when you see the entire city of operate,

1169
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,210
how about the one guy who,

1170
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,490
who escaped from Hiroshima and then
went to Nagasaki and they dropped it on

1171
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:55,150
Nagasaki?

1172
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:55,660
Oh yeah.

1173
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,270
That's the fucking crazy man.

1174
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,113
Out of both of them.

1175
00:29:59,530 --> 00:29:59,801
I mean,

1176
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:01,870
can you imagine after that you're like,

1177
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:02,710
you're never gonna believe.

1178
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:07,711
What could you imagine what it must've
been like to see both of those cities

1179
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:11,240
with nail the argument that
maybe they didn't need to,

1180
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,050
didn't need to drop to like they
could've maybe just dropped the one.

1181
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,110
They definitely got to drop one.

1182
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:15,970
The actual argument,

1183
00:30:15,971 --> 00:30:17,530
I think we're talking about it yesterday,

1184
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,170
is that they might not
need to drop anything.

1185
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:23,660
Like the Japanese might've already been
trying to surrender and realize that I

1186
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,640
am my yet.

1187
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,021
Oh,

1188
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:26,830
is that right?

1189
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,480
Kind of thing we've got to do first.

1190
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,243
I don't know if that's true.

1191
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:30,851
You know,

1192
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:32,620
like also I've heard that a,

1193
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:35,830
we knew that the Japanese were going to
attack Pearl Harbor and we kind of let

1194
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:36,401
it happen.

1195
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,170
We pulled the over that too.

1196
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,690
It's just always the
same and competence dude.

1197
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,230
It's like could be I
fucking or the Illuminati.

1198
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,930
I get nos fucking arguments all the time.

1199
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,550
John Dam Illuminati.

1200
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,140
They're looking at it right now.

1201
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,290
You're already feel a bit of them too.

1202
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,340
If they want me to draw triangles on shit,

1203
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,060
I'm fucking so into it taking
place from the Illuminati.

1204
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,550
I'd be happy to serve.

1205
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,610
So they tried to get you fired
from the show and it didn't,

1206
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,361
it didn't work.

1207
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:05,560
But because I'm nobody,

1208
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:07,270
so if they picked,

1209
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,550
she picked like is she made
me pick the famous dude.

1210
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:11,410
She could've made something
happen but she picked somebody.

1211
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,970
Nobody fucking his heard of.

1212
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,140
Do you think that's what they're doing?

1213
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:16,930
They're just trying to get traction
and go onto somebody else's shit.

1214
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,333
Right.

1215
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,690
There's a lot of that right,

1216
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,900
but you get forever because it's a good
cause you get away with shitty behavior

1217
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:27,340
and shitty interaction skills.

1218
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,390
If someone's like,

1219
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:30,760
I'm geared towards like a
lot of people like all right,

1220
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:31,594
well what's the,

1221
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,730
what's going to be the liberal
or Conservative position?

1222
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:36,400
And I'm identify as that so
I'm just going to go with that.

1223
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,290
I don't really have even
taught me to think about it.

1224
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:38,770
You know,

1225
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,610
we should probably don't.

1226
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,920
And you just go with the liberal
cause like that's just what it is.

1227
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:43,420
It's just knee jerk forever.

1228
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,560
Well I think it's really interesting
comparing it to religion,

1229
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,690
comparing the mindset to cult
mindsets or religious mindset.

1230
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,480
You have to be true,

1231
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:52,810
right?

1232
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:57,430
They just have specific things that are
suddenly a gospel that must be true and

1233
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:59,650
you must ignore all the fucking evidence.

1234
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,150
That's what I used to do,

1235
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:02,350
to not believe in evolution.

1236
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,040
I would ignore the shit that's not because
there's no way would I believe can't

1237
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:06,820
be true.

1238
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,810
I'm familiar with that.

1239
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,730
Like this,

1240
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:13,330
this rolling stone article that came out
where they were deceived by this woman

1241
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,150
who claimed to have been
gang raped by a uh Oh,

1242
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:16,391
right.

1243
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:18,370
Well she set out to find how horrific.

1244
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,031
By the way,

1245
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:20,260
that's a real problem.

1246
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,020
But you know that didn't
get served to well by,

1247
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,790
by someone making it like the most
outlandish story that I've ever heard.

1248
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,480
Yeah.

1249
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,313
And uh,

1250
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,850
but that's the thing she set out to find
cause she already knew it to be true

1251
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:34,181
but,

1252
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:34,751
but you know what,

1253
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:35,810
I don't get how a,

1254
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,900
I was watching vice did you
say the vice thing about it?

1255
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:42,690
About Columbia and they're talking
about campus rape like oh how come they,

1256
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,440
the school gets to deal with it at all?

1257
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,400
The only answer I heard was because
convictions are hard to get in a court of

1258
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:53,300
law and that might be
the only way to like,

1259
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,220
I guess convict a rapist.

1260
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:56,480
But so what he gets expelled,

1261
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:57,314
like that's,

1262
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,161
if someone rates you,

1263
00:32:58,161 --> 00:32:59,180
that's a good enough punishment.

1264
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:00,560
They just get expelled from school.

1265
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,510
So is that really what happens if they
don't bring it to a criminal court?

1266
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,100
I,

1267
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,460
if somebody knows telling me cause I
have no idea to this day why all these

1268
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:08,151
institutions,

1269
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:09,020
church or whatever.

1270
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,930
Why is there anything where
they handle it in house?

1271
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:16,040
I thought we all knew by now
molestations are handled out outside.

1272
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,580
Right.

1273
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,870
Like that just makes more sense.

1274
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,890
That's interesting cause I didn't,

1275
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,920
I always knew that they were accusing
people and they were expelling people and

1276
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:25,970
they were judging people.

1277
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,140
Whether whether or not it was based on
all the evidence or whether or not they

1278
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,280
were correct in there,

1279
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:33,140
assuming that this person was guilty.

1280
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,600
Like this guy in the
University of Virginia,

1281
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:39,620
he kinda got really fucked over
this and now he's suing and yeah,

1282
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:40,460
but that's okay.

1283
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:41,510
Let's say he was guilty.

1284
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,590
Oh that's justice.

1285
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:44,330
He got expelled for rape.

1286
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,460
That's your fucking side.

1287
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,300
Like how are you satisfied with that?

1288
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:47,691
Yeah.

1289
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:48,480
How could they be?

1290
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,090
So you won't have a really good,

1291
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,130
he'll have to go to
another different school.

1292
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,283
Like what?

1293
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,840
What have you done to stop
rape with that spelling people?

1294
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,890
Well this is what I'm talking about
is getting my stories confused.

1295
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,590
I'm talking about the
kid who the kid is suing.

1296
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:06,380
Is the kid who the girl is
walking on my mattress girl.

1297
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,220
Yeah,

1298
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,053
he's suing.

1299
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,500
He's suing for misandry.

1300
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:10,760
That was,

1301
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,960
I got confused.

1302
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,590
The other,

1303
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,670
the other story doesn't really have a
real man that was accused of anything,

1304
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,410
right?

1305
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,200
No,

1306
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,790
the rolling stone when
you're talking about,

1307
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,643
okay.

1308
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,340
I have no fucking footnotes.

1309
00:34:22,341 --> 00:34:23,210
Sorry for any of this.

1310
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,403
But uh,

1311
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,940
what I read was this girl was part of the
Anti Rape Croup and she had a crush on

1312
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,610
one of the guys in the Anti Rape Group.

1313
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,240
Okay.

1314
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,860
Because the friends of her were saying,

1315
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:37,580
I don't know that we know something
happened because she was hysterical,

1316
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,310
but she had been making up
this fake guy who was texting.

1317
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:40,791
Yeah.

1318
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,560
If this girl is really super cool,

1319
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,550
she said at first this guy started out
as a guy to make the other boy thinks

1320
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:46,310
someone wanted her.

1321
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,143
Right.

1322
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,650
And then it ended up with the guy that
you heard George Glass from the Brady

1323
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:54,140
bunch basically she
made up a Georgia glass.

1324
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:54,471
Right?

1325
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:55,580
Like what's her name?

1326
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,151
The Middle One?

1327
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:58,580
I'm Brady Bunch Monaco.

1328
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,230
No,

1329
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,063
no,

1330
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,890
Jan.

1331
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,130
Yeah,

1332
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,870
she did a Jan Brady and made this,

1333
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:03,704
cause the older one,

1334
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,760
her fake boyfriend.

1335
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,170
So then she comes and says,

1336
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,630
George Glass raped me and all that shit.

1337
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:09,021
And it was,

1338
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:10,700
it was to get attention from this guy.

1339
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,790
She's like a weird chick
and she just got into it.

1340
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,670
And so because they're inclined
to automatically believe,

1341
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:17,101
they just,

1342
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:17,421
they're like,

1343
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:18,021
I don't know,

1344
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:20,720
but it was bothering
them and the f the check,

1345
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:21,920
they wrote it during them.

1346
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,460
Yes.

1347
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,690
And this is an anti rape group.

1348
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:24,051
They were like,

1349
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:26,120
I don't know if Jackie's
like telling the truth.

1350
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,661
Oh,

1351
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:27,140
okay.

1352
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,973
Do you know what I mean?

1353
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,090
But listen,

1354
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:31,610
you got to look it up so I
promise you I didn't dream it.

1355
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,370
Oh yeah.

1356
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:35,181
But there's just more to,

1357
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:37,350
I just don't want any
cut and dry everything.

1358
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,130
Like if you,

1359
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,150
if somebody says you got raped,

1360
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:41,520
the answer is we'll
take it very seriously.

1361
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960
It's not believe or don't believe.

1362
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,321
It's like,

1363
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:46,530
well let's really investigate this because
that's an important thing to get to

1364
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:47,364
the bottom of.

1365
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,930
And there's got to be like really strong
punishment for someone who uses false

1366
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:53,460
rape accusations.

1367
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:53,971
I mean there,

1368
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:54,360
there,

1369
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,610
there has fucking been
there are there in place.

1370
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:00,960
Well then we'll kind of punishment do
they did in the issue is let's say you

1371
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:02,490
know that you had to say,

1372
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,120
let's say you had,

1373
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,320
you had to say you didn't get,

1374
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,250
you know the numbers for a women who
lie about rape that are used usually by

1375
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:12,600
feminist websites where they're like
only like 2% or something is of women.

1376
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,680
That's a really bad number because that
that's counting women who have gone to

1377
00:36:16,681 --> 00:36:19,080
the police and recanted their accusation.

1378
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,540
So you don't know if those women were
being pressured to do that or it does

1379
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,710
that.

1380
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:27,030
It's not an accurate measure of like a
liar is not going to go to that and say,

1381
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:28,230
I was lying about it.

1382
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:33,300
So not only your fucking real victims
and and also like a light more liars are

1383
00:36:33,301 --> 00:36:34,520
getting away with that says no.

1384
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,970
Let's just look at what that,

1385
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:36,751
what that is.

1386
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:39,870
What I'm saying is two out
of a hundred if you look,

1387
00:36:39,871 --> 00:36:44,100
if you get 2% is two out of a
hundred that's not good odds.

1388
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,320
Well the real nobody
knows is the real answer.

1389
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,161
I'm just saying,

1390
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:50,070
if you had a law to make it a really
stiff penalty for when we lie about rape,

1391
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,450
I always watch it with that
because I don't want someone,

1392
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,920
let's say a woman got
pressured into saying she lied.

1393
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,900
It gets swept up under the,

1394
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,090
uh,

1395
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,190
under a law like that.

1396
00:36:59,191 --> 00:36:59,970
Do you know what I mean?

1397
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,980
That's when it gets the death
penalty because I don't want,

1398
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:05,610
one guy who didn't do it to try
to say is under their numbers.

1399
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,480
If you have 20 guys and each one of
those guys had sex with five women,

1400
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,760
two of them have been
falsely accused of rape.

1401
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,130
That's crazy.

1402
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,271
I'm not good at math,

1403
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:16,030
but I believe you.

1404
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,863
If that was great,

1405
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,740
I'm not terrible at math to someone
probably about there screaming,

1406
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:21,830
fuck.

1407
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,330
But it is how the numbers work because
we're talking about a hundred people.

1408
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:24,841
Okay?

1409
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:25,674
If there's a hundred,

1410
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,360
there's a hundred dudes or a hundred uh,

1411
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,250
sexual,

1412
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:29,580
uh,

1413
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,413
cases,

1414
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,020
right?

1415
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,780
They're talking about 2%
2% of these rape cases are,

1416
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,150
are falsely accused.

1417
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,260
2% well,

1418
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:37,571
Lizzy,

1419
00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:37,800
man,

1420
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,390
I don't know.

1421
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,380
I have to actually have a hundred rapes,

1422
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:40,831
so I'm,

1423
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:44,410
I'm really not doing it
right because like it's,

1424
00:37:44,411 --> 00:37:45,720
you'd have to have a hundred rapes.

1425
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,540
It's not like a hundred people had a very,

1426
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,310
had a 2% of sexual encounter.

1427
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:50,531
Wow.

1428
00:37:50,531 --> 00:37:51,360
How good is the sweet?

1429
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,010
I'm smoking.

1430
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,190
It's very suspicious.

1431
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,700
That calculates that much Joe.

1432
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,880
This is what's wrong with my idea.

1433
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:57,840
But even then,

1434
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,111
okay,

1435
00:37:58,111 --> 00:38:01,500
let's say if there is a hundred cases
that are brought in front of the,

1436
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,041
the cops,

1437
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:02,400
right.

1438
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,630
And out of a hundred of them,

1439
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,160
two of them are totally bullshit.

1440
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,240
That's a lot because they
probably get how many a year?

1441
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:11,460
So how many a year or you're dealing with
where people are being falsely accused

1442
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:12,294
and locked in a cage.

1443
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,300
He's an as big of a deal as rape.

1444
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:15,901
Of course.

1445
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:16,350
Not.

1446
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,100
Of course not.

1447
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,370
Is it way worse than they're
getting falsely accused?

1448
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,290
Probably way in the ones on
the penalty shapes than false.

1449
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,124
Accused rapes.

1450
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,013
Probably way more.

1451
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,380
Right.

1452
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:25,830
Well look,

1453
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,340
so rape is up way bigger issue
than falsely accused rape.

1454
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,190
But it doesn't mean that falsely
accusing someone of rape is okay.

1455
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,040
It's not like Dell who says that
it's a real fucking problem.

1456
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,400
Well they tried to underplay

1457
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:36,670
it.

1458
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,170
They try to make it out
like it's not a big deal.

1459
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,280
The people that are really trying to
stop rape should be most concerned with

1460
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,590
making sure that false rape
accusations are punished.

1461
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:48,130
Because I make sure that you really
highlight like exactly what the actual

1462
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:48,920
problem is.

1463
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,050
The the real problem.

1464
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:50,884
Not Wait.

1465
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,570
When you say be most concerned with that,

1466
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,030
I think be most concerned
with law enforcement of it.

1467
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,260
You know,

1468
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,430
but let me ask you this,

1469
00:38:57,431 --> 00:38:58,264
cause I always,

1470
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,781
you know,

1471
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:01,420
one in four that statistics
seemed very high,

1472
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,080
right?

1473
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,750
One in four,

1474
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:06,040
four of low college age women are
raped because that wasn't the same.

1475
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,993
But the is now.

1476
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,081
Well now listen,

1477
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:08,501
let me ask you,

1478
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:08,920
cause I,

1479
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,150
in my personal life,

1480
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,370
I know a lot of people of both sexes,

1481
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:15,640
Hoo Ha got sexually assaulted
somehow like a lot dude.

1482
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,730
And you know,

1483
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,351
probably that could be,

1484
00:39:17,351 --> 00:39:19,810
cause I just hung out
around drug people a lot.

1485
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,201
You know,

1486
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:24,880
that's how you meet people that got
fucking sexually assaulted or it could be

1487
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:28,690
that the people that aren't in the bed
circle like that are just lying about it

1488
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:30,160
and pretending that didn't happen to them.

1489
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,530
So I don't know like it
maybe it is that high.

1490
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,060
It's just there's no way to really tell.

1491
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:34,840
Well,

1492
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,720
it all depends on what you
consider sexual assault.

1493
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,990
And they sometimes try to
make it as broad as possible.

1494
00:39:40,991 --> 00:39:41,860
Like one of the,

1495
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,690
there's two really nutty robot Dick.

1496
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,600
There's two really things that they,

1497
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:47,020
uh,

1498
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,430
they've tried to do recently.

1499
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,530
One of them was in New Jersey.

1500
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:54,220
They were trying to pass some law that
made it where if there's any deception

1501
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:56,530
involved that lead to
someone having sex with you,

1502
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:57,160
then it's rape.

1503
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,410
I can't say I'm a big
time producer anymore.

1504
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,750
Oh my God,

1505
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,360
I can't tell what I'm
a foot doctor anymore.

1506
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,353
You'll be a,

1507
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,750
you become a rapist as long as if,

1508
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,840
if that's the reason why the
person under false pretense early.

1509
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,010
If the lie was,

1510
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,180
I don't have aids,

1511
00:40:13,181 --> 00:40:14,014
then I get it.

1512
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,220
But other than that,

1513
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,603
yeah,

1514
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,051
that's,

1515
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:17,680
yeah.

1516
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,180
But you know what it is,

1517
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:19,361
man.

1518
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:22,360
It's like everybody makes it
makes sex such a fucking big deal.

1519
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,120
That's a real part of
the problem is that sex,

1520
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:28,660
when everybody wants the idea of
pleasure between people and part of it is

1521
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:31,420
because we don't wear any
clothes because we were close.

1522
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:32,770
Rather we cover everything up.

1523
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,480
And then the idea of like getting at it,

1524
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:34,930
oh,

1525
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,070
it's underneath there.

1526
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,480
When they get some,

1527
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,030
and we make it out to be
such a big deal and we,

1528
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:40,480
we,

1529
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:40,880
we,

1530
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,400
it becomes like this
overwhelming thing that like,

1531
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,920
it sort of like infects
people's consciousness.

1532
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,690
You know,

1533
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:48,931
we're,

1534
00:40:48,931 --> 00:40:51,280
we're fascinated by all aspects of it.

1535
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,480
Whether it's a,

1536
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,950
whether it's rape or whether
it's abstinence or whether it's,

1537
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:57,341
you know,

1538
00:40:57,341 --> 00:41:00,150
monogamy or whether it's being a whore.

1539
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,003
It's like Wah,

1540
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,680
we're just obsessed.

1541
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,120
Obsessed with sex.

1542
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:04,391
Yeah.

1543
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:05,224
Well listen,

1544
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,580
that doesn't have my girlfriend put it
reaps just like a very primal form of

1545
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:10,414
dominance.

1546
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,340
And that's what a what a Gal.

1547
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,030
Yeah.

1548
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,661
Then she's smart,

1549
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:14,171
but that's what it is.

1550
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,220
Like my dog,

1551
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:16,720
my poor fucking dog got like,

1552
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,730
that's an animal fucking thing.

1553
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,410
That's in mammals,

1554
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,244
man.

1555
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:21,641
Yeah.

1556
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:22,840
He said it really is.

1557
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,793
It certainly is,

1558
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,830
but do the only way I think
you're ever going to stop it.

1559
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,611
The only way that really,

1560
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:28,381
truly makes sense.

1561
00:41:28,381 --> 00:41:30,820
You've got to figure out how to
engineer better human beings.

1562
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:31,451
Yeah.

1563
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:32,380
Obviously only way.

1564
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:32,930
It's the only way,

1565
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,110
but how the fuck do you do that?

1566
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,990
It is kind of good kitten.

1567
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Like hopefully I don't think there's a
people survive that it won't kind of get

1568
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:43,320
more civilized hope.

1569
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,300
I don't think so too.

1570
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,660
As long as everything keeps going
and assuming it's not a fucking,

1571
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:48,410
you know,

1572
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,430
mad max thing.

1573
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,180
That's what I'm saying.

1574
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,361
Yeah.

1575
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:51,194
With the preppers win.

1576
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,900
That's when I was in South Dakota,

1577
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:54,600
the earth,

1578
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,161
this guy,

1579
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:56,510
I was doing this place in South Dakota,

1580
00:41:56,511 --> 00:41:57,830
this something beach club.

1581
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,880
It was actually a good show,

1582
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,520
but the dude that booked me,

1583
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,690
or like the manager of the club,

1584
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:05,780
he drove us to a mount
Rushmore and we were talking,

1585
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,110
he was telling me that he's
building a bunker and I was like,

1586
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:09,591
dude,

1587
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:12,890
like don't you already like live in
a bunker called this South Dakota.

1588
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,280
Right.

1589
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,420
And he and I.

1590
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:15,740
It's for Jesus reasons,

1591
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,180
not red dawn reasons.

1592
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,170
Jesus reasons.

1593
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:19,850
So he thinks the second coming,

1594
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,290
I mean we talk,

1595
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,310
he's a real nice guy too.

1596
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,040
We talk about real.

1597
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,710
I've just,

1598
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,460
I used to believe all that shit not,

1599
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:30,520
this is the second comment by the
end times and Armageddon and I don't,

1600
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:33,860
there's nowhere does it say you're going
to be able to have a bunker in fucking

1601
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:35,300
like a bunker.

1602
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:36,134
You're way out of it.

1603
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,660
You can use the information
that God's provided you.

1604
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,420
Make sure that your family would
be the only ones that survive.

1605
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,100
Much like no it didn't see.

1606
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:44,290
The Internet is like the,

1607
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:48,080
the Voice of God really tells
you about the impending.

1608
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,970
A return of kills.

1609
00:42:49,971 --> 00:42:51,080
Kills everyone was a surprise.

1610
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,850
God wanted me to masturbate that much.

1611
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,031
Oh,

1612
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:53,691
you know it's fucked.

1613
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:53,960
If you,

1614
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,190
if the second coming he's coming,

1615
00:42:55,191 --> 00:42:56,840
that means Jesus is going to take you.

1616
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,250
He's going to take you up to heaven.

1617
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,630
He thinks maybe he won't.

1618
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,660
He thinks he won't be taken maybe
and he thinks like he'll have to.

1619
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,180
He's that bad that he had.

1620
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,650
He'd probably have to hang
out and go to heaven later.

1621
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,190
She's going to have to fuck these
people that he's gotten prisoned in his

1622
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:11,000
bunker.

1623
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,480
Yeah.

1624
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,300
Duncan Trussell met one of those
dudes who went and visited a,

1625
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:14,630
this,

1626
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,240
this bomb shelter bunker thing under the,

1627
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,710
under a mountain somewhere.

1628
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,030
He drove deep into it.

1629
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:22,280
We do this Scifi show where he drove deep.

1630
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,850
They have RVs down in there and there
are supplies the rate and not like the

1631
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:26,570
band.

1632
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:26,841
Well,

1633
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:28,580
if you believe the fucking Bible,

1634
00:43:28,581 --> 00:43:30,770
by the way it says not even the mountains.

1635
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:32,690
We'll hide any people.

1636
00:43:32,691 --> 00:43:34,100
So they don't bother with your bunker.

1637
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,420
Just a read your fucking,

1638
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,500
but that guy was a prepper.

1639
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:37,640
He wasn't oh Jesus.

1640
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:37,940
Bang.

1641
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,300
Oh well that's smarter.

1642
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:40,303
You grew up.

1643
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,940
Jehovah's Witnesses are,

1644
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:44,660
the other ones are not
allowed to use doctors.

1645
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,970
That's a Christian scientist.

1646
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,250
I'm not even sure what extent
they're like that either.

1647
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,690
But that's not Jehovah's Witnesses.

1648
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:50,990
No.

1649
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,820
So what is the Jehovah's Witnesses?

1650
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,170
The ones that knock on everybody doors.

1651
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:55,750
And what,

1652
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,583
what was that,

1653
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,000
the main door knocker it was just fucking,

1654
00:43:59,001 --> 00:43:59,780
uh,

1655
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,411
you grew up in,

1656
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:01,140
it's a religion where,

1657
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,300
yeah,

1658
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:01,701
yeah.

1659
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:02,870
You have to like do it.

1660
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,580
So it's not like being like,

1661
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:07,490
I would always envy Catholics cause
you don't have to fucking do it.

1662
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:08,423
Right.

1663
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,860
They had like a cool,

1664
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:10,430
like,

1665
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,930
like I had to like be in it,

1666
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:13,010
you know,

1667
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:13,843
all the time.

1668
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,770
Yeah.

1669
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:14,931
Yeah.

1670
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:17,630
That's your primary goal
is to be ready for the end.

1671
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,150
Most people that call themselves
Catholic fucking never go to church.

1672
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,240
Probably a big percentage
kick out Michael Corleone.

1673
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:23,600
Right.

1674
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,433
Ever.

1675
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,480
Like you're a murderer,

1676
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,323
you have to leave.

1677
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,560
Jesus forgives you.

1678
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,040
He just kind of go to confession,

1679
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,990
talk about all those
people that you don't look,

1680
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,430
it's a good system.

1681
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,730
So you have a hand job and once
in a while for that and for,

1682
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,660
did your parents grow up in it?

1683
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,441
Uh,

1684
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:37,860
no.

1685
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,610
My mom converted from Catholic
when she was a teenager and my dad,

1686
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,120
my grandfather converted his family.

1687
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:44,661
My Dad's home.

1688
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:45,810
He told my dad was like 12th.

1689
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:46,680
Wow.

1690
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,610
Your grandfather.

1691
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:50,790
So the grandfather took the
father and the whole family,

1692
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:52,800
including your dad when he
was already 12 years old.

1693
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:53,101
And so yeah,

1694
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:53,431
come on,

1695
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:54,180
you're coming with me.

1696
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,290
But my joining the call.

1697
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:55,740
Yeah.

1698
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,220
Well my dad grew up really like
definitely build planes for World War II.

1699
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,240
Wow.

1700
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,590
He was a fucking smart dude.

1701
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:02,640
So he was an engineer,

1702
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,710
but he never went to college and uh,

1703
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:08,580
he was very anti war I guess or
something at the end of the war.

1704
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,290
And he was like a would
you have as witnesses?

1705
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,810
Don't get involved in politics or a war,

1706
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,510
but you can't be a
Christian and fight a war.

1707
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,620
I don't know why people think he can,

1708
00:45:16,621 --> 00:45:17,454
but you can't.

1709
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,750
It's pretty clear about it.

1710
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,690
People really believe God gives
a fuck about their country.

1711
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:22,230
And it's,

1712
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,020
it's so like in plain English.

1713
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:25,883
Well,

1714
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:26,723
I mean it's an Aramaic,

1715
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:28,903
but it's like,

1716
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:32,640
it's a very clear teaching that he
doesn't approve of any of the countries.

1717
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:33,840
He's going to ruin all of them.

1718
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,160
You just have to obey
them until the income.

1719
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:36,421
That's,

1720
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:38,640
that's the extent of your obligation.

1721
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,301
But a,

1722
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:43,140
you can't fight like drop a bomb
and another Christian for America.

1723
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,700
How could that fucking go over?

1724
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:45,451
Yeah.

1725
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,720
And if America was dropping bombs
like Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

1726
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,300
they had out of a couple
of Christians down there,

1727
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,720
of course they had to.

1728
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,090
You think God forgives you for that?

1729
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:54,661
Like what?

1730
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:56,940
More than a cause you've saved whatever.

1731
00:45:56,941 --> 00:45:58,530
Like he doesn't give a
shit about your country.

1732
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:59,820
So how did you bail on it?

1733
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:00,751
I,

1734
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:01,500
uh,

1735
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,550
I started reading,

1736
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,240
uh,

1737
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:03,391
well,

1738
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:04,290
first of all I was like an asshole.

1739
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,070
I was just like,

1740
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,030
didn't want to do it,

1741
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,230
you know,

1742
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,300
I had that in me of what
kind of school did you go to?

1743
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,290
Uh,

1744
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:10,981
I went to regular school.

1745
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:11,960
I wasn't like homeschooled.

1746
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,170
Some people do that in it.

1747
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:13,890
Right.

1748
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:14,723
But you know,

1749
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:16,940
I went to my and shit,

1750
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,530
you know.

1751
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:17,880
Okay.

1752
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,070
So it wasn't that super
restrictive for me.

1753
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,510
So it depends on your parents were,

1754
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,060
was it you going to school
and talking to other kids,

1755
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:24,381
it's sorted.

1756
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:27,210
You lead you off the path of God no more.

1757
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:28,044
It was a,

1758
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,640
I went to college,

1759
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,320
uh,

1760
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,153
postal I went to,

1761
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:31,560
it was,

1762
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,150
yeah,

1763
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,820
it was,

1764
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,770
but I know that the seeds I already been
reading like kind of skeptic shit on my

1765
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:39,120
lunch breaks at the Wiz.

1766
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,020
I would buy these magazines at Barnes
and noble that would call skeptic.

1767
00:46:43,021 --> 00:46:45,060
So that feels like a
little foundation of it.

1768
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:47,820
And then pussy later
when I got to college.

1769
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:48,540
Wow.

1770
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:48,700
Yeah.

1771
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,680
Pussy right out of that.

1772
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,690
So both things are good.

1773
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:52,830
The reading was good,

1774
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:53,820
and then the pussy was good.

1775
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,250
But what is it like being like 1920 going,

1776
00:46:56,251 --> 00:46:58,320
what the fuck did I think?

1777
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:58,831
Oh,

1778
00:46:58,831 --> 00:46:59,910
I felt really guilty,

1779
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:00,590
dude.

1780
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:03,000
Do you mean that's one of the reasons
why you probably did friends with Ari?

1781
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:03,991
Yeah,

1782
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:05,250
I got along with him immediately.

1783
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,470
You guys have these exact same story.

1784
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:07,921
Yeah.

1785
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:08,611
While I was like a minute,

1786
00:47:08,611 --> 00:47:08,851
I mean,

1787
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:11,490
I was technically a minister and uh,

1788
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,010
and he was supposed to be like a ramp.

1789
00:47:13,011 --> 00:47:13,440
I right.

1790
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,850
She had already lived in one of those
crazy religious houses in Israel for a

1791
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:19,750
long time and was so many years studying.

1792
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:20,783
I don't remember.

1793
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:21,691
He talks.

1794
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:22,524
I don't always listen,

1795
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,453
but

1796
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,213
I just don't remember.

1797
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,500
He mumbles a lot.

1798
00:47:28,501 --> 00:47:29,350
It's hard to catch everything.

1799
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:29,741
You've got to go,

1800
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:30,574
wait what?

1801
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,660
You lived in a what?

1802
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:32,840
Say That again coach,

1803
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,560
what does that word but um,

1804
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,160
you know,

1805
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,230
he was studying the tour
like 10 hours a day.

1806
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:42,910
Like all day they would still be on tour
and he was full Gung Ho and then you

1807
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:43,061
know,

1808
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:45,850
by the time when I met him it was
only like a few years after this,

1809
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:49,960
which is really crazy now that I look
back and think about it like he was not,

1810
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:51,970
when he was coming first coming
around to the comedy store,

1811
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:56,930
he was not that far removed from
living in this crazy religious commune.

1812
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,600
And you know,

1813
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:00,160
I'll tell you a nine
types of the problems,

1814
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:01,360
especially with this rape shit,

1815
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:05,260
all of this horrible stuff about how to
direct him to just treat it is straight

1816
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:06,094
out of the good book.

1817
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,540
I mean that's like a huge,

1818
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,730
the Moses story had dyno.

1819
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,680
Did you have a study Bible
shoot when you're younger?

1820
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,300
I only studied it in first grade.

1821
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:15,730
First grade was the only year
that I went to Catholic school.

1822
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,850
And then second grade I won second grade,

1823
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:20,110
I went to San Francisco.

1824
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,060
So it was first grade.

1825
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:26,950
And then second grade was like super
hippie people living next door,

1826
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:27,201
like a,

1827
00:48:27,201 --> 00:48:30,280
went from one extreme to a
total Sodom and Gomorrah.

1828
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:30,491
Right.

1829
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,640
So I don't remember any
of the biblical stories.

1830
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,000
I looked him up as an adult.

1831
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,310
I had my book of Bible Stories,

1832
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,990
which I look back at it.

1833
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,910
The lessons are hilarious
that were in there.

1834
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:41,650
So like Abraham's daughter,

1835
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:43,420
Dinah or maybe Dina,

1836
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,710
I don't know how to pronounce these names,

1837
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:45,281
but,

1838
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:45,940
uh,

1839
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,600
she was,

1840
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,250
uh,

1841
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,150
she made friends with like worldly girls,

1842
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,421
you know,

1843
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:51,730
from the city that
weren't her same religion.

1844
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:52,031
Right.

1845
00:48:52,031 --> 00:48:55,120
And she'd go hang out in the
city and then this guy check him,

1846
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,710
saw her and forced her
to lie down with him.

1847
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,120
Like she,

1848
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,271
you know,

1849
00:48:58,271 --> 00:48:59,104
she got raped,

1850
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,400
but who you might've held their hand.

1851
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:01,990
It's like ancient fucking,

1852
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:02,591
you know,

1853
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:03,191
bronze age,

1854
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,024
Jewish shy.

1855
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,650
So it might've held her hand.

1856
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,930
So then he falls in love
up in a micro aggression.

1857
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:08,960
He fully,

1858
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,490
yeah,

1859
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,600
he falls in love with
her after he raped her,

1860
00:49:11,601 --> 00:49:11,710
aren't,

1861
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:12,600
goes to Abraham and says,

1862
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,690
let me marry her,

1863
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:14,470
you know,

1864
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:15,610
which will preserve her honor.

1865
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:16,301
He really was like,

1866
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:16,690
okay,

1867
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,430
fine.

1868
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:17,780
Uh,

1869
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,840
but your whole household has
to get circumcised first one.

1870
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:21,760
The COMERICA is fine,

1871
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:22,930
we'll all get our Dick Smith.

1872
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:23,981
Okay.

1873
00:49:23,981 --> 00:49:28,420
So while while they get are recovering
from getting their dicks snipped,

1874
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,570
Dina's brothers are enraged by this.

1875
00:49:31,571 --> 00:49:35,410
Like it was their sister a whore and
they go and kill everyone in check hims

1876
00:49:35,411 --> 00:49:35,831
household,

1877
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:39,160
like his whole family while they're laid
up from their Dick's getting cut and

1878
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,300
then Abraham Psych,

1879
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,890
what did you just do to us?

1880
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,430
Now people are going to
hate us around the world.

1881
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:46,510
It's like one of those things about
how Jews are going to be in trouble now

1882
00:49:46,511 --> 00:49:48,040
because something you did and he goes,

1883
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:50,860
now people will be hated wherever we
go because of this thing you have done.

1884
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,090
And uh,

1885
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:52,540
yeah.

1886
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,120
So the,

1887
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,480
the lesson that you get from it
and my book of Bible Stories,

1888
00:49:55,481 --> 00:50:00,481
like all of this happened because DNA
chose poor associates and they put it all

1889
00:50:01,511 --> 00:50:02,344
on their own.

1890
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,510
That's the lesson of the story.

1891
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:05,950
This dumb bitch to stay home.

1892
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:08,440
So that's getting out
of the fucking Bible.

1893
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,210
And so listen,

1894
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,470
that's why Patriot,

1895
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:12,790
I always see like patriarchy.

1896
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,350
I'm against that shit too.

1897
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:14,891
Like that,

1898
00:50:14,891 --> 00:50:15,910
that ancient Bible,

1899
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:16,840
he patriarchy shit,

1900
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:17,674
I'm not for that.

1901
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,171
I'm,

1902
00:50:18,171 --> 00:50:22,570
I'm Kinda like w would be 90% with a lot
of these shit if they didn't have such

1903
00:50:22,571 --> 00:50:23,740
a thought crimes unit.

1904
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,371
Exactly.

1905
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:28,070
That's the thing about this whole
social social justice movement

1906
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,740
is that in looking for people that have,

1907
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,280
that have been guilty
of these transgressions,

1908
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:34,580
they,

1909
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,680
they've missed a lot of
allies to miss people.

1910
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:37,760
Like they're on their side,

1911
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:41,930
like you like being like a lot of money
and they're trying to make assholes out

1912
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:43,340
of people and they're doing it.

1913
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:47,060
The vast majority of the people that are
involved in this like really aggressive

1914
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:48,500
social justice warrior shit,

1915
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:49,850
they're fucking depressed,

1916
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:50,390
man.

1917
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,800
They're really depressed people.

1918
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,060
You'll go through their timeline.

1919
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,440
It's almost without fail.

1920
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:59,300
When I read some really ridiculous over
the top hyper aggressive social justice

1921
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:00,080
where shit,

1922
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,280
I'll go to the fucking pro,

1923
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,160
their Twitter profile and
I'll find some depressed shit.

1924
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,580
Right.

1925
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,320
I'll find some tweets about depression.

1926
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:07,970
I was find some tweets about,

1927
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:08,210
you know,

1928
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:08,540
how,

1929
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,020
how,

1930
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:09,351
you know,

1931
00:51:09,351 --> 00:51:10,580
everything sucks today.

1932
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:12,920
Like I see what's going on.

1933
00:51:12,921 --> 00:51:13,080
You're,

1934
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:13,490
yeah.

1935
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:17,090
You're lashing out at the world
through a legitimate cause.

1936
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,050
Well,

1937
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,640
don't take it personal thing.

1938
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:20,181
Exactly.

1939
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:20,751
Say like,

1940
00:51:20,751 --> 00:51:21,950
I'm every woman.

1941
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:22,130
No,

1942
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:22,880
you're not.

1943
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,850
Let's see if you can find enough of
those people and you get together,

1944
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:29,000
then you feel like you are right because
you're around a bunch of other fuck

1945
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:32,330
heads that are also
being that Catholic guy.

1946
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:32,930
What's his name?

1947
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:33,763
Michael Donahue.

1948
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,930
It's just him and like
his cousin or something.

1949
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:36,590
Right.

1950
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:37,240
Or the,

1951
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,073
our league,

1952
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,000
like it doesn't take that much,

1953
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,200
but it used to be member.

1954
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:44,240
It was church crazies that
would write these letters.

1955
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:44,900
Yeah.

1956
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,370
Like please take something off
the air and now it's fucking a,

1957
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,300
it's like young college kids.

1958
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:51,134
That's insane.

1959
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:51,591
Well,

1960
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:51,741
it's,

1961
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:52,030
yeah,

1962
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:54,620
they literally is taking the
exact same position that,

1963
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:56,150
that fucking Michael,

1964
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:57,660
whatever the fuck his name guy is.

1965
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,410
I've heard that guy talk on opiate
Anthony before the Catholic league.

1966
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,263
Oh yeah,

1967
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,550
I've heard that guy talking to opie
and Anthony and defend because how

1968
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,251
Catholicism,

1969
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:05,511
it was like,

1970
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:06,920
what are you talking about?

1971
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,053
Like how,

1972
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:08,521
what do you use it?

1973
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:08,691
You're,

1974
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:11,630
you're mad at someone
making fun of Catholicism.

1975
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:15,030
It's one of the most easily
made fun of religions of all.

1976
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,820
I asked him this on that show.

1977
00:52:16,821 --> 00:52:17,241
I'm like,

1978
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:17,960
cause I was a Christian.

1979
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,830
Like you know,

1980
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:22,370
you're supposed to rejoice
when you are persecuted.

1981
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:22,641
Right.

1982
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:23,780
That's what Christ said.

1983
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,370
They're going to persecute you.

1984
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:26,300
Like they did me.

1985
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:27,440
So rejoice.

1986
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:30,470
So you're supposed to be happy about it
because it means you're doing the right

1987
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:31,650
thing and that's,

1988
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,523
you're not supposed to go,

1989
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,483
oh dear,

1990
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,760
you're a Christian.

1991
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,200
Cause she's turning the other cheek.

1992
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:37,250
You don't fucking,

1993
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:38,540
what did he say to that?

1994
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:39,800
He just kind of ignored it.

1995
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:41,240
I don't think it's about that for him.

1996
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,230
I think it's about publicity.

1997
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:42,680
It's,

1998
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:42,891
yeah,

1999
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:45,200
it's publicity and being part of a club.

2000
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,690
It's just all football
team shit everybody does.

2001
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,590
And endorsements.

2002
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:48,861
I mean,

2003
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:51,480
cause they really getting paid a lot
of money by other Catholics who want to

2004
00:52:51,481 --> 00:52:52,490
support Catholicism.

2005
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,070
I have a friend who's a Catholic and
he's got a lot of money and he's fucking

2006
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:55,904
craziest shit.

2007
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,680
And he has a priest come over his house.

2008
00:52:57,681 --> 00:52:58,610
When he buys a new house,

2009
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:02,270
a priest comes over and
does like a fucking little
seance and shit or something.

2010
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:02,561
I mean they,

2011
00:53:02,561 --> 00:53:03,410
they have some sort of a,

2012
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:07,010
they have some sort of a call to say
what the fuck they call it's Voodoo.

2013
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:07,844
It's all Voodoo.

2014
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,450
Real Catholic gives 10%
of his money to church.

2015
00:53:10,451 --> 00:53:11,284
It's like the whole thing.

2016
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:12,550
Yeah.

2017
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:12,911
When they,

2018
00:53:12,911 --> 00:53:13,131
they,

2019
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:16,670
they have him involved in all sorts of
church projects and they're just sucking

2020
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,504
money out of this dude.

2021
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:18,030
It's,

2022
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,100
it's a God damn call.

2023
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,210
It's 100% called,

2024
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:20,651
well,

2025
00:53:20,651 --> 00:53:20,840
I,

2026
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,680
here's how I judge him.

2027
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:22,730
All the religions is,

2028
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:22,910
uh,

2029
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:23,900
how much does it cost?

2030
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,770
Okay,

2031
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:25,160
yeah,

2032
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:25,650
I know.

2033
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:26,010
And then

2034
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,430
do what,

2035
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:29,520
does God do his own killing or
do I have to do his killing?

2036
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,301
And,

2037
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:30,540
uh,

2038
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,320
and then my personal thing is if I have
to stay in it more for my mom or my dad,

2039
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:35,461
like my religion,

2040
00:53:35,461 --> 00:53:38,730
my mom was the reason I had to
stay for a while more than my dad.

2041
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,490
But if I was from like a harsher place,

2042
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:42,990
it would be like your father's honor.

2043
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,230
You can't leave cause you,

2044
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,080
that's like a more primitive,

2045
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,191
that's how,

2046
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:47,461
you know,

2047
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:48,091
it's kind of primitive.

2048
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:49,590
But if it doesn't cost that much,

2049
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:50,424
then fine.

2050
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:51,270
And if I'm not,

2051
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,350
there's no violence.

2052
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,660
Once you take the violence part out of it,

2053
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:57,930
like nationalism or a whatever,

2054
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,310
it's a lot less threatening.

2055
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,121
You know,

2056
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:00,421
it's a,

2057
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:01,980
it's more voluntary now.

2058
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:05,130
The kind of shitty thing is that they
will stop talking to you if you leave.

2059
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:05,730
Right.

2060
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:06,690
So you have to face,

2061
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:07,321
you know,

2062
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:08,340
being shunned or some,

2063
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,330
I was just fellowshipped.

2064
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:09,690
Right.

2065
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:13,560
So that means like a lot of my former
friends can't talk to me or they would be

2066
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:15,170
in trouble for talking to an apostate.

2067
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:19,130
So that's fellow shipped
disfellowshipped disfellowship yeah.

2068
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:22,260
It's like a disconnection
in a Scientology.

2069
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,280
Wow.

2070
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,860
Except it's not as harsh as a,

2071
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:26,701
you know,

2072
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:27,900
like I still speak to my mom,

2073
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:29,790
like it's not like she mad at you.

2074
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:30,740
No,

2075
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,080
no,

2076
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,261
no,

2077
00:54:31,261 --> 00:54:32,094
not now.

2078
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,330
She was mad initially.

2079
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,640
Does she ever listen to reason
that it might be horseshit?

2080
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,211
Yeah,

2081
00:54:36,211 --> 00:54:38,970
but I don't want to fucking
talk her out of her shit really.

2082
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:43,860
First of all that that charges taken up
a lot of slack of hanging out with my

2083
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:44,880
mom and they said to him,

2084
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:45,990
okay,

2085
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,823
God bless them.

2086
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,600
I want you to lose that
where I got to pick up.

2087
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,733
I say,

2088
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,510
I don't want to have
those calls from rice.

2089
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:53,880
Yeah,

2090
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,010
get it saves you some $2 bills.

2091
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:58,751
Like Weirdo mom,

2092
00:54:58,751 --> 00:54:59,490
Shit.

2093
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:03,180
She called me up that she tell me she
had a hotel and it was going to send me

2094
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:03,950
and my girlfriend,

2095
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:04,230
uh,

2096
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,850
they had these jelly beans and a bowl,

2097
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,121
which is like,

2098
00:55:06,121 --> 00:55:07,020
what's your address?

2099
00:55:07,021 --> 00:55:11,580
I'm gonna send you some jelly beans from
his fucking bowl in the hotel lobby.

2100
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,660
That's hilarious.

2101
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,310
That's hilarious.

2102
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,630
So you bailed,

2103
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,310
you can't talk to them anymore.

2104
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,620
And what was the process?

2105
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:21,600
Did you have to fill out
paperwork or do you say,

2106
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:21,810
oh,

2107
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:22,860
I just stop going,

2108
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,600
but I think my mom wanted
me to write a letter.

2109
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:24,871
I'm like,

2110
00:55:24,871 --> 00:55:28,380
I don't owe any shame in a letter
to the chair's resignation.

2111
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,140
Wow.

2112
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:29,360
I'm like,

2113
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,240
I don't owe that.

2114
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,760
I put in my time would be important.

2115
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:33,570
I'd fucking church.

2116
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:34,620
I don't owe them a letter.

2117
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:35,041
How old?

2118
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,090
You'll notice I'm going.

2119
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,680
How old were you when you wrapped it up?

2120
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:40,290
19 wow.

2121
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,221
Oh no wait,

2122
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:44,280
maybe I was a 20 that's
a good time though.

2123
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,540
That 1920 times.

2124
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:48,390
It's just becoming a man basically
becoming a man like you're on.

2125
00:55:48,391 --> 00:55:49,830
The more you're at the door,

2126
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,950
21 know like official is
Chi declawed you know,

2127
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:54,540
before I had to go live in the world.

2128
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:55,620
Yeah.

2129
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:55,921
It's,

2130
00:55:55,921 --> 00:55:56,460
you know,

2131
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,960
they teach you to not be worldly.

2132
00:55:57,961 --> 00:55:59,250
That's what you're learning to be.

2133
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,710
And how so like would be
as Babes unto the world.

2134
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:04,920
Like a Paul said,

2135
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:05,880
you have to be,

2136
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:06,690
you know,

2137
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,760
like when you see people
that just came out of a cult,

2138
00:56:08,761 --> 00:56:10,440
there's a certain kind
of innocence to them.

2139
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,950
So when I came out it was always like
these kind of real slutty girls that would

2140
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:14,310
fuck me.

2141
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:18,540
Like it really experienced girls and
that was my appeal to them was kind of my

2142
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,870
fucking foster kid.

2143
00:56:19,871 --> 00:56:20,251
Sean,

2144
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,660
you know that makes sense.

2145
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:25,570
Like I was with a lot of like kind either
like a stripper or like some kind of

2146
00:56:25,571 --> 00:56:29,220
sex work or where we were like
foster kids together kind of on it.

2147
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,220
Do you know what I mean?

2148
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,670
Like you took care of each other
because like you treat me like not,

2149
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:34,571
not a John.

2150
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:39,571
They treat me like the like the Weird
James James Woods from casino that for

2151
00:56:40,211 --> 00:56:42,100
some reason they can never
get away from this loser.

2152
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,203
Oh that's right.

2153
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:43,780
So the guy didn't,

2154
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:43,971
yeah,

2155
00:56:43,971 --> 00:56:45,850
I didn't make any money
for the whole fucking,

2156
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,360
I just had to have girlfriends that
I had to just like live off of.

2157
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,980
So this is not good.

2158
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:51,371
It's this,

2159
00:56:51,371 --> 00:56:52,870
when you first got out of the church?

2160
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,641
When I first gear,

2161
00:56:53,641 --> 00:56:54,220
I got the name.

2162
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,830
When did you start doing
standup in college.

2163
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:58,570
So you went from the church to live in,

2164
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:00,640
in New York with chauffeurs
first I was in Philly.

2165
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,270
Okay.

2166
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:01,651
No might,

2167
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,180
well my girlfriend at the time in college,

2168
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:05,670
but she's a,

2169
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:09,190
when I met her and then she
became like a comic and then uh,

2170
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:10,960
but I was with her for like,

2171
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:12,160
he's going to be like six years,

2172
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:14,710
but we were engaged but
I didn't have a job like,

2173
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,930
and I like refuse to get
a job the whole time.

2174
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,850
I was just a piece of shade.

2175
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:19,081
Said,

2176
00:57:19,081 --> 00:57:19,390
yeah.

2177
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:19,810
Wow.

2178
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:20,770
Tell me I'm a colonic.

2179
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,960
Well you just said you were a comic.

2180
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:23,560
That's it.

2181
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,393
Yeah.

2182
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,900
Here's a deep been doing it then.

2183
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:30,130
Not enough to do any of that
a year or two years from now.

2184
00:57:30,131 --> 00:57:30,581
Like me,

2185
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:31,860
like three or four years before,

2186
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:33,220
but just weren't making any money yet.

2187
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:33,941
And then a,

2188
00:57:33,941 --> 00:57:36,970
and then I ended up with this girl who
was older than me and may kind of good

2189
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:40,450
money and she liked it better
when I didn't have money.

2190
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,340
When I started to get
one more shit at that,

2191
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:44,260
put a strain because she
could suddenly upset.

2192
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,140
Yeah.

2193
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,980
She didn't want me to be out
of that kind of control zone.

2194
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:48,281
Yeah.

2195
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:50,200
I dated a girl once and uh,

2196
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:51,480
we broke up and she,

2197
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:56,510
she dated this guy and she was very
specific about why she was with him and I

2198
00:57:56,531 --> 00:57:56,681
go,

2199
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:57,130
why?

2200
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:57,431
She goes,

2201
00:57:57,431 --> 00:57:58,900
she's never going to
fucking break up with me.

2202
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:00,701
And I was like,

2203
00:58:00,701 --> 00:58:01,534
really?

2204
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,171
She goes,

2205
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:02,560
yeah,

2206
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,371
I mean he's great.

2207
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:06,300
All I like them but I'm
better looking than he has.

2208
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:06,941
I like,

2209
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,950
she was like really adamant about me.

2210
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:10,933
Advance.

2211
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,350
You engineered the control position.

2212
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:13,600
Yeah.

2213
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,433
Relationship.

2214
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:18,370
You're tired of not being in control and
relationships tying them into even you

2215
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:19,930
or what have you and you're like,

2216
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:20,530
this is it.

2217
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,020
But she would get drunk and
wanna fuck all her ex boyfriends.

2218
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:24,400
She was just a mad maniac,

2219
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:25,990
which is always how that goes.

2220
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:26,920
It's like people,

2221
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,020
like one thing about my girlfriend now,

2222
00:58:29,021 --> 00:58:30,010
like I really,

2223
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:35,020
it kind of up to my fucking who I am a
little bit because now I would never be

2224
00:58:35,021 --> 00:58:37,240
in another bullshit like
psycho relationship.

2225
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:38,650
Like I'm just not going
to settle for that.

2226
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,000
I'll be fucking alone.

2227
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:41,410
I don't give a shit like,

2228
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:43,150
so that kind of taught me to,

2229
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,780
because I met somebody that like,

2230
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:47,320
I really got along with
that I thought was like,

2231
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:48,401
you know,

2232
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:49,450
like I don't know,

2233
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:50,170
just got me.

2234
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:50,860
So I was like,

2235
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,191
oh,

2236
00:58:51,191 --> 00:58:54,970
I don't have to be in these things anymore
because I am so low self esteem that

2237
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:55,241
I'm like,

2238
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:58,690
well this person wants to
fuck me and Lou stay with me.

2239
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:00,183
Stay with them.

2240
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:03,580
It becomes a one of those things where
sometimes you don't even know who you are

2241
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:04,690
if you're in a bad relationship.

2242
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:04,960
Yes.

2243
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,670
Cause the way you're
reacting to this person,

2244
00:59:06,671 --> 00:59:08,740
that's what makes you
different fucking person.

2245
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:09,603
Yeah.

2246
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:09,881
Yeah.

2247
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:11,800
If you're in a good relationship
and you realize like,

2248
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,281
Oh wow,

2249
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:13,270
these are possible,

2250
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:14,870
but until you get in one line,

2251
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:18,130
so some people go through their entire
life birth to death without hitting gold.

2252
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,270
They chip away at that.

2253
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:22,070
Fuck you deep digging into
another Chiba part of you're

2254
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,090
a bold man while had a quarter.

2255
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:24,651
Very,

2256
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:25,670
very bold man.

2257
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:27,543
That's pretty good.

2258
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,080
Now why do you feel sad
when you go back home?

2259
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:32,870
Home to where my mom's Hell

2260
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:34,880
No.

2261
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,740
Back home to New York where
you don't have to chant,

2262
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:38,630
get your weed that easy.

2263
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:39,710
Oh my God dude.

2264
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:41,480
Ari Shaffir it tells
me it was a nightmare.

2265
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,610
I think God or he sometimes has something.

2266
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,310
I wish I could get shit like this there.

2267
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:47,541
Yeah.

2268
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:50,210
Is that like hide like
an animal to smoke weed?

2269
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,411
Yeah,

2270
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:55,040
you do have to hide like an animal right
to in Seattle I was smoking in front of

2271
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:58,130
a cop at this ridiculous glass,

2272
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,540
like a wizard pipe.

2273
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:01,610
A good day officer.

2274
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:03,500
It was so relaxing.

2275
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,420
It was a pipe you would
never bring outside.

2276
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:09,650
I wonder when that's going to be the
entire country cause like in New Orleans

2277
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,950
apparently you could just drink on
the street and we had a driver in New

2278
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:12,950
Orleans.

2279
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:14,690
He was telling me once he
was outside of New Orleans,

2280
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:17,600
he was doing something and he's talking
to the cop and the cop was asking them a

2281
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:21,350
question and he had a beer in his hand
and he was just talking to the cop and he

2282
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:24,230
didn't realize the cop was talking to
him because he had a beer in his hand.

2283
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:24,440
Oh.

2284
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,590
So he finishes the beer and then
he cracks open a second one.

2285
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:28,101
The cop goes,

2286
01:00:28,101 --> 01:00:29,480
are you fucking retarded?

2287
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,310
Like what do you do?

2288
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:31,101
And then the cop goes,

2289
01:00:31,101 --> 01:00:31,934
where are you from?

2290
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:32,751
And he goes,

2291
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:33,470
New Orleans.

2292
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:33,890
And he's like,

2293
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:34,190
oh,

2294
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:35,023
okay,

2295
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,171
listen dude,

2296
01:00:36,171 --> 01:00:38,350
you can't do that shit in other places.

2297
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,880
Like this is the only place where you
can do what else happened to this?

2298
01:00:40,881 --> 01:00:42,020
Definitely white man.

2299
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,373
Nothing,

2300
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:46,910
not even a slap on the wrist.

2301
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,300
They told him to put his
beer back in the back,

2302
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:52,850
asked him to cool it a little bit.

2303
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:58,790
But you get used to that and you know if
you did what you did in Seattle in some

2304
01:00:58,791 --> 01:00:59,690
parts of the country,

2305
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:01,130
they would fuck you over man.

2306
01:01:01,131 --> 01:01:04,190
They would do would put you in a
cage if you were in parts of Georgia.

2307
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,920
They'll find out they're
not cool about it.

2308
01:01:05,921 --> 01:01:06,754
And Georgia,

2309
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,110
is there any places that
have open container laws?

2310
01:01:09,111 --> 01:01:10,940
Because I remember
growing up there was like,

2311
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:11,600
people were like,

2312
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:11,691
oh,

2313
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:13,430
you're allowed to drink
if you're not driving.

2314
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,650
Like you could have it
like in the back seat.

2315
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:20,270
And then I went to another place and did
that and got in trouble for having an

2316
01:01:20,271 --> 01:01:21,290
open container and they're like,

2317
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:21,471
no,

2318
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:22,310
you can't do that.

2319
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:22,941
Yeah,

2320
01:01:22,941 --> 01:01:23,270
there's,

2321
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:24,470
well they used to,

2322
01:01:24,471 --> 01:01:27,530
it used to be okay everywhere that people
used to like literally have a beer in

2323
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:30,140
their lap and they drove around and
suddenly people were crashed into each

2324
01:01:30,141 --> 01:01:30,270
other.

2325
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:30,441
They go,

2326
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:30,980
okay,

2327
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:35,090
you can't have a fucking got it
took to fix that to put it together.

2328
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,140
Those normal shit,

2329
01:01:36,141 --> 01:01:36,560
man,

2330
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,450
I can't drink while I'm driving.

2331
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:38,691
Yeah.

2332
01:01:38,691 --> 01:01:40,040
That was literally,

2333
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:43,400
that was normal shit a long time
ago and like seventies right.

2334
01:01:43,401 --> 01:01:45,050
That changed in like the 70s I don't know.

2335
01:01:45,051 --> 01:01:47,920
When they started incorporating
drunk driving laws and I don't know,

2336
01:01:47,921 --> 01:01:50,660
it was a bunch of people got killed and
they didn't really have a strong and

2337
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:50,841
saying,

2338
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:51,860
I don't know why.

2339
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:53,270
I don't know when,

2340
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:53,500
oh,

2341
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:53,990
when,

2342
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:55,370
and I wonder what they did.

2343
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,150
At first,

2344
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:59,420
I guess it was just testing your
movement and then they figured out

2345
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:00,870
breathalyzers and then the,

2346
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,670
you know,

2347
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:02,540
moved on from there.

2348
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:03,960
But yeah,

2349
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:04,111
no,

2350
01:02:04,111 --> 01:02:04,520
I don't want to,

2351
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,160
I can't stand fucking drunk.

2352
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,360
I just so annoying to deal with like,

2353
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,010
cause I don't really drink that much dude.

2354
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,240
I'm more of just like a pine.

2355
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:11,961
Yeah.

2356
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,190
Drunk is the worst as far as like people,

2357
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,310
I mean potheads can
absolutely be annoying,

2358
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:20,420
but the sure they're not as
violent and true and retarded.

2359
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:21,870
That's the,

2360
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:22,710
that's the big one.

2361
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:25,410
The standing real close
to God when you are,

2362
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:29,220
when you're out somewhere and a drunk
person just interrupts a conversation,

2363
01:02:29,221 --> 01:02:30,180
just gets in your face,

2364
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:31,560
starts striking at you and you're like,

2365
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,730
oh God.

2366
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:33,480
Yeah.

2367
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,950
And if you try to avoid them,

2368
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:35,850
you're the asshole.

2369
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:36,740
Yeah.

2370
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,300
I'm telling you,

2371
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:37,670
I just,

2372
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,700
my lease a worst drug.

2373
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,510
It's the worst drug.

2374
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:40,530
It's one of the worst drugs,

2375
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,240
but it's fine if you can manage it,

2376
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:43,530
if you can handle it correctly.

2377
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,180
I mean get an eight ball at least,

2378
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:47,110
and even out like a gentleman,

2379
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,713
like a gentlemen,

2380
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:51,450
get an eight ball and either
you're going to get that drunk,

2381
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,171
at least a,

2382
01:02:52,171 --> 01:02:52,970
you know,

2383
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:57,190
can even out like a gentleman named
herself up by your bootstraps with,

2384
01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:01,110
I have a buddy used to do a lot of coke
and he used to always drink forties

2385
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:03,990
after he did coke and
smoke it and then he would,

2386
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,640
he would like his heart and be like,

2387
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:06,860
oh,

2388
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:09,660
nice to have to take him to the liquor
store and he'd buy like old English.

2389
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:13,200
You remember those bags of you get
a fucking 40 ounce of old English.

2390
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:13,340
Yeah.

2391
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,280
You ever try that stuff?

2392
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:14,750
Yeah.

2393
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,240
Yeah.

2394
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,220
It's unbelievably strong.

2395
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,113
Yeah.

2396
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:19,320
It's,

2397
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,050
they call it malt liquor
because it's not really beer.

2398
01:03:22,051 --> 01:03:22,261
Right?

2399
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:23,094
Is that the idea?

2400
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:23,761
I don't know.

2401
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:24,440
Is that what it is?

2402
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,251
I think it is beer,

2403
01:03:25,251 --> 01:03:26,660
but I think it's just made different.

2404
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:28,280
It's made a stronger,

2405
01:03:28,281 --> 01:03:29,114
stronger.

2406
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:30,001
Okay.

2407
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:30,101
How,

2408
01:03:30,101 --> 01:03:31,770
what do you think the
alcohol by volume is?

2409
01:03:31,771 --> 01:03:32,140
I'm like,

2410
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:32,450
liquor.

2411
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:32,721
Well,

2412
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:32,871
what,

2413
01:03:32,871 --> 01:03:33,231
what is,

2414
01:03:33,231 --> 01:03:37,120
what is a bug like a
Budweiser likes a s seven.

2415
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,533
I have no idea.

2416
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:39,861
Well,

2417
01:03:39,861 --> 01:03:42,360
it's different in America than
it is in Canada and Canada.

2418
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,500
It's like 9% mostly of us.

2419
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,790
It's like 7% but a,

2420
01:03:46,791 --> 01:03:48,260
what percentage is malt liquor?

2421
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:53,250
Did you hear what happens when you
ask Siri what zero divided by zero is?

2422
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:54,900
No,

2423
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:55,051
no.

2424
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:56,400
What happens Siri,

2425
01:03:56,401 --> 01:03:57,990
what's zero divided by zero?

2426
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:03,720
Imagine that you have zero cookies and
you split them evenly among zero friends.

2427
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:05,850
How many cookies does each person get?

2428
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:07,830
See it doesn't make sense.

2429
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,880
And cookie monster is sad that there
are no cookies and you are sad that you

2430
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:12,870
have no friends.

2431
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,160
That's real series a card.

2432
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:18,740
Such a mean bitch.

2433
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:19,820
Um,

2434
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:24,620
the term includes any alcoholic beverage
of the 5% or more alcohol by volume

2435
01:04:24,621 --> 01:04:26,420
made with malted barley.

2436
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,360
So it's just another way of saying beer,

2437
01:04:29,361 --> 01:04:29,910
I guess.

2438
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:30,081
Yeah,

2439
01:04:30,081 --> 01:04:31,620
he's still like drink mad dog.

2440
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:32,071
20,

2441
01:04:32,071 --> 01:04:32,371
20,

2442
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:33,061
I think it's called.

2443
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:33,894
And then,

2444
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:34,331
yeah,

2445
01:04:34,331 --> 01:04:34,780
drink.

2446
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,210
I had 'em mad dog 20.

2447
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,990
We had that an old English.

2448
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,130
We're drinking those.

2449
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:40,751
I've watched a,

2450
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:41,450
you ever see that movie?

2451
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:42,520
Superfly oh yeah.

2452
01:04:42,521 --> 01:04:43,300
Back in the day,

2453
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,380
me and my friend John,

2454
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:44,831
we,

2455
01:04:44,831 --> 01:04:45,250
uh,

2456
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,840
when we're just starting out as comics,

2457
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,620
we got hammered on old
English and mad dog 20,

2458
01:04:50,621 --> 01:04:50,891
20,

2459
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:53,200
and those 40 ounce liquors
and watch superfly.

2460
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:58,900
I remember being like
shocked at how strong it was.

2461
01:04:59,080 --> 01:04:59,261
Like,

2462
01:04:59,261 --> 01:05:01,270
I don't know how much the old English has.

2463
01:05:01,271 --> 01:05:01,641
Let's see.

2464

2471
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,220
I bet it's around that.

2472
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,440
What proof is that?

2473
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:15,993
What is it?

2474
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:17,343

2481
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,223
All right.

2482
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:28,660
Um,

2483
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,140

01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:38,501
No.

2489
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:39,270
What's that?

2490
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:40,103
It's pretty good.

2491
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:42,040
Cobra is only six,

2492
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:42,640
Huh?

2493
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,301
Heartburn.

2494
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:43,930
To me,

2495
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:46,330
I would've thought King Cobra
would be off the charts.

2496
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:48,320
What does King Cobra,

2497
01:05:48,321 --> 01:05:49,660
Cobra King Cobras.

2498
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:50,260
A malt liquor.

2499
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,110
It's not what's,

2500
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:52,300
what's the six?

2501
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:53,231
Oh yeah.

2502
01:05:53,231 --> 01:05:54,370
I would've thought it'd be more too.

2503
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,293
Yeah.

2504
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,110
So it was thought it
would have fucked you up.

2505
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:00,700
Is that just because the advertising
was done with that black guy from star

2506
01:06:00,701 --> 01:06:01,170
wars?

2507

01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:04,880
Why is that cool?

2509
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:05,290

01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:07,690
45 oh he was totally fine.

2512
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:08,581
How much does it cost?

01:06:08,581 --> 01:06:10,480
45 have cool.

2514
01:06:10,481 --> 01:06:12,520
45 gravity logger.

2515
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:16,150
Five six what does 10 evil eyes?

2516
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:18,460
10 Jesus Christ and camp black ice.

2517
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,620
Black ice.

2518
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:21,321
Okay.

2519
01:06:21,321 --> 01:06:21,641
I'm all,

2520
01:06:21,641 --> 01:06:22,890
I thought it's a camp.

2521
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:24,430
What the fuck dude?

2522
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:26,010

01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:28,220
Stack high gravity lager.

2524
01:06:28,221 --> 01:06:30,100
His head 12 oh my God.

2525
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,290
We should get some of that
and have a drunk cast.

2526
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:36,010
We need to get some of that stack.

2527
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:37,750
High gravity logger.

2528
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:38,980
Jamie,

2529
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,980
you need to go to Compton and find out
what it Salamat cause they don't sell

2530
01:06:41,981 --> 01:06:42,880
that in white neighborhoods.

2531
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:44,373
Need to go,

2532
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:46,300
go do some research for the show.

2533
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:49,150
It's very important robot Dick.

2534
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:49,961
I know every,

2535
01:06:49,961 --> 01:06:50,800
I can't help it.

2536
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:55,801
You smell cigarettes also or do you
know you give up what's per weight or

2537
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:58,630
nicotine level is a six six yeah.

2538
01:06:59,050 --> 01:06:59,550
That's better.

2539
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:00,071
That is sex.

2540
01:07:00,071 --> 01:07:00,904
I don't wake up,

2541
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:01,511
you know,

2542
01:07:01,511 --> 01:07:05,410
you have a unique perspective coming
from a really crazy religious background

2543
01:07:05,411 --> 01:07:06,760
like that as a comic cause he,

2544
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:10,630
cause he kind of see where the pitfalls
of thinking live because you were

2545
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:14,080
indoctrinated in them from I
have a strong reaction to them.

2546
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:18,850
Something like really bugs
me if I encounter it again.

2547
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,650
Well it's what,

2548
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:20,920
that's one of the things that you and I,

2549
01:07:20,921 --> 01:07:24,920
you got to you and I share this opinion
of like a lot of what's going on,

2550
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:27,760
like what people would like to
call social justice warriors.

2551
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:30,610
That it is really like
kind of a religious thing.

2552
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:31,090
It's a same,

2553
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,320
it's a very similar thing.

2554
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:36,220
It's not an even objective approach that
a lot of people are taking this thing.

2555
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:39,470
It's as gang mentality pylon.

2556
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:43,310
I'll take on faith with it that I'm
not just going to take on faith.

2557
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,333
Okay.

2558
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,970
It's really just the bottom line.

2559
01:07:45,971 --> 01:07:46,804
But uh,

2560
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:47,411
you know,

2561
01:07:47,411 --> 01:07:49,300
whenever I got to taking things on faith,

2562
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,633
I don't worry is bad.

2563
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:51,281
I don't mind.

2564
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:54,010
Like if it's a little more
challenge to get my jokes over,

2565
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:55,840
like I just makes me better.

2566
01:07:55,841 --> 01:07:57,670
So I don't have a
problem with that at all.

2567
01:07:57,671 --> 01:07:58,540
I like trying to,

2568
01:07:58,810 --> 01:07:59,740
trying to get around that.

2569
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:00,790
I think that makes it funnier,

2570
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:04,420
but don't then make it like I
can't work if I fuck up in the,

2571
01:08:04,421 --> 01:08:04,870
in,

2572
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,310
in the cause of trying to do that.

2573
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:06,730
Right,

2574
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:07,150
right.

2575
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:10,870
Well I think that like a gangster
movie is a legitimate art form.

2576
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:11,171
You know,

2577
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:13,150
the soprano's is a legitimate art form.

2578
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:13,840
Right?

2579
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,530
Well guess what someone doing?

2580
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:20,090
Obviously tongue in cheek misogynist
material is a legitimate art form as well.

2581
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:25,280
Like you can't say the dice clay is
not a legitimate artist thing of people

2582
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:26,060
couldn't,

2583
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,830
they just didn't know it was a character.

2584
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:28,610
Like it wasn't all,

2585
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:30,650
you think a lot of that
shit of against him was,

2586
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:32,720
people didn't realize he
was doing a character.

2587
01:08:32,721 --> 01:08:33,920
Of course they realized it.

2588
01:08:33,921 --> 01:08:35,240
They were just looking to be upset.

2589
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:38,960
It cause as a kid I was a kid when he's
out and I remember not knowing that that

2590
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:39,770
was a character.

2591
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:40,940
Well you were a kid though,

2592
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:41,300
right?

2593
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,710
If you're old enough to pay taxes,

2594
01:08:42,711 --> 01:08:44,270
you should no dice Clay's fucking around.

2595
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:45,830
I think people like don't.

2596
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:47,190
Yeah.

2597
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,023
It's a fucking,

2598
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,360
I think he's a,

2599
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,650
he's a great artist.

2600
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:54,291
Nora Dunn,

2601
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:55,310
where she was like,

2602
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,000
you know,

2603
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,260
I think she's about to be off the show.

2604
01:08:57,261 --> 01:09:00,890
So she did that stunt of not coming on
and the rest of the cast was mad at her

2605
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:01,101
like,

2606
01:09:01,101 --> 01:09:04,090
so what are we the woman haters
cause we did the show with those.

2607
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:04,711
That's right.

2608
01:09:04,711 --> 01:09:06,410
Because the types of
things that fucked him up,

2609
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,240
whatever movie's Great.

2610
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:09,680
Ford Fairlane I love that movie.

2611
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,530
What fucked him up was there
was no internet back then.

2612
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:13,880
That's what fucked him up.

2613
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:16,070
When you get banned from MTV,

2614
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:18,350
like he did like [inaudible] recourse.

2615
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,160
There's nothing to do.

2616
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:19,701
Oh you're right.

2617
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:21,080
He could have been on the fucking NBA.

2618
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:22,850
Well they can blackball you.

2619
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,870
They could back then.

2620
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:26,360
They can't really blackball
you anymore because you go,

2621
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:26,840
all right,

2622
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,370
I'm starting to dice clay podcast.

2623
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,900
Oh Mike,

2624
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,181
I liked to,

2625
01:09:33,181 --> 01:09:35,000
he has an album of him bombing.

2626
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:35,391
Oh,

2627
01:09:35,391 --> 01:09:39,220
it's one of the best and that it's
Rick Ruben fucking produced it.

2628
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,850
The laughter die I use,

2629
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:45,440
I got a very interesting
thing that I have never,

2630
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:45,911
what does it,

2631
01:09:45,911 --> 01:09:46,661
comic has a,

2632
01:09:46,661 --> 01:09:47,890
it's a two disc set.

2633
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,760
It's just two discs.

2634
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:50,870
It's great.

2635
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:51,920
It's an awful though.

2636
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:52,791
He's bombing.

2637
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:54,830
This guy gets up in the
middle of his set and he goes,

2638
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,753
you're about it.

2639
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,390
Funny as our glass on milk

2640
01:09:59,690 --> 01:09:59,930
guys.

2641
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:03,050
Cause he wasn't announced and
he showed up a danger fields,

2642
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:03,990
which is,

2643
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,823
you know,

2644
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:05,601
the dingy,

2645
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:07,040
his little clubs in New York,

2646
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:09,080
so it's like we're count
Chocula was buried.

2647
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:14,120
That club doesn't make any sense because
it's named after one of the all time

2648
01:10:14,121 --> 01:10:18,140
great standup comedians and it's always
filled with hacks and it's empty most of

2649
01:10:18,141 --> 01:10:18,620
the time.

2650
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,750
But there's was a few
great comics at work.

2651
01:10:20,751 --> 01:10:22,100
They're like George.

2652
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:27,170
I did set there with auto
and George during the prom
season when they rotate the

2653
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:28,850
people in one after the other,

2654
01:10:28,851 --> 01:10:29,684
after the other.

2655
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:30,860
So it was always a few comics,

2656
01:10:30,861 --> 01:10:34,400
but there was also a few that were
hanging around there that didn't work

2657
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:35,234
anywhere else.

2658
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,020
They just,

2659
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:36,530
it's like,

2660
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,960
it was like the comedy store in
the 90s when the comedy had these,

2661
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,530
the comedy store had these like ancient,

2662
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:41,751
I remember that.

2663
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:45,050
I remember like the very
last of them remember Nancy?

2664
01:10:45,051 --> 01:10:46,940
A fuck.

2665
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:47,900
She was a host there.

2666
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:49,430
She was nice.

2667
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:52,880
She had a boat telling me what the
hell was her name was Nancy something?

2668
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:56,690
I know she was like a holdover
from the old that of that crew.

2669
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:57,290
Yeah,

2670
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:57,831
exactly.

2671
01:10:57,831 --> 01:11:00,350
She told me how to get like
health insurance if you couldn't,

2672
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,680
didn't,

2673
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,190
you know.

2674
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:02,300
Oh Wow.

2675
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:03,500
Did you ever meet Bobby?

2676
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,170
Bobby gone by the time you got there.

2677
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:06,891
Who's,

2678
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:08,570
hey Bobby was the big Scottish guy.

2679
01:11:08,571 --> 01:11:09,404
That was a doorman.

2680
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:10,170
No,

2681
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:11,180
Chartio is there.

2682
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:11,571
Oh,

2683
01:11:11,571 --> 01:11:11,930
okay.

2684
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:13,230
All the way by the way is no,

2685
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:13,530
like,

2686
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:15,540
you know the county comes
of like hot wagers is,

2687
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:16,890
it was just all old men,

2688
01:11:16,891 --> 01:11:19,210
like a fucking steakhouse Tuxedos.

2689
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:20,763
Tuxedos on.

2690
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:21,623
Yeah.

2691
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:22,720
And that's how Bobby wasn't,

2692
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:24,990
Bobby was this giant power
lifter and needs to have a,

2693
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:28,350
he didn't have to have
like some ridiculous scene.

2694
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:29,130
You know,

2695
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:31,230
they would have to like tailor
his shit because he was a,

2696
01:11:31,231 --> 01:11:32,640
he was a mountain of a man.

2697
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,020
He was only about five to eight,

2698
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:35,940
but he's probably about 230 pounds.

2699
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:37,050
He was fucking enormous,

2700
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,750
just spit fucking tank of a guy.

2701
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,860
And he would literally grab people
by their neck and pick them up,

2702
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:46,230
like lift them up and carrying him out.

2703
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:47,063
So I'm do it.

2704
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,250
He just grabbed this guy
and carried him out to,

2705
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:52,410
he was funnier than any of the
comedians who was hilarious.

2706
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,380
And it was right before you go onstage.

2707
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:54,780
It was,

2708
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:57,330
I guess you're going to go try
the trick them at that bag.

2709
01:11:57,331 --> 01:12:00,290
I Shite active yours and they're like,

2710
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:00,481
you,

2711
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:01,320
you would kill.

2712
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:01,801
And he goes,

2713
01:12:01,801 --> 01:12:02,610
look at that yet.

2714
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,620
Tricked another group of assholes.

2715
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:06,180
But he was funny,

2716
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:06,910
he was saying,

2717
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:07,341
right,

2718
01:12:07,341 --> 01:12:07,590
right.

2719
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:08,910
He was fucking with you.

2720
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:13,350
But he was funny and he knew who was
good and it was bad and he wasn't shy and

2721
01:12:13,351 --> 01:12:14,184
letting you know.

2722
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:14,940
Yeah.

2723
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:15,810
He's a funny dude,

2724
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:16,080
man.

2725
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,520
Worked at club for a long ass time.

2726
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:21,080
Do you go there and do
you do spots until uh,

2727
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:21,580
you know,

2728
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:24,210
I was like mad and he was like
vowed I would never go back there.

2729
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:24,690
Why?

2730
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:25,860
And I think they even forgot.

2731
01:12:25,861 --> 01:12:27,930
I told them never call me because
they've just called me like,

2732
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:28,860
are you around for where?

2733
01:12:28,861 --> 01:12:30,240
It's like that's how
much it didn't matter.

2734
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:31,170
My little stand.

2735
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:32,850
What was the stand over?

2736
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:34,980
I can't remember to do some shit.

2737
01:12:34,981 --> 01:12:36,960
Where the fuck I don't remember.

2738
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:38,400
But I was like furious about it.

2739
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,450
I can't,

2740
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:40,283
I can't remember.

2741
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:43,860
That's a club that should be
revived if it's still around God,

2742
01:12:43,861 --> 01:12:45,480
you got to make sure that
place doesn't go under.

2743
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,040
That's a magic room.

2744
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:49,290
The way that room is set up and built.

2745
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:49,861
Yeah.

2746
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:53,070
I used to like playing there and it was
good to get a half hour spot somewhere,

2747
01:12:53,071 --> 01:12:53,380
you know,

2748
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:54,213
crate Rome.

2749
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,171
It's a great room.

2750
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:55,950
It's just,

2751
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:58,800
it was always just manage
a very bizarre way.

2752
01:12:58,930 --> 01:12:59,763
Yeah,

2753
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:00,970
I do.

2754
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:01,660
Uh,

2755
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,720
so iconic I guess.

2756
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:05,250
I mostly like the stand and like,

2757
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:07,370
so it's supposed to be
amazing standing here.

2758
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:08,320
A lot of great things about it.

2759
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:09,653
I fucking love it.

2760
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,820
And the seller and then stand up New York.

2761
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:12,510
I'm out a lot,

2762
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:12,751
you know,

2763
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:13,860
danger fields was where they,

2764
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:17,360
they did an actual danger special
from that place I think it was.

2765
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:18,000
No.

2766
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,181
Yeah,

2767
01:13:18,181 --> 01:13:18,451
I know,

2768
01:13:18,451 --> 01:13:18,810
right?

2769
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:19,643
Yeah.

2770
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:20,431
God Damn.

2771
01:13:20,431 --> 01:13:21,264
What a club.

2772
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:22,051
That's funny.

2773
01:13:22,051 --> 01:13:24,900
That was like one of the early
specialist that was in a comedy club,

2774
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:25,500
you know,

2775
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,170
instead of a big giant theater
and is one of the best ones too.

2776
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:29,071
Yeah.

2777
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:29,970
That's a classic one.

2778
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:30,691
Live walk.

2779
01:13:30,691 --> 01:13:30,931
Yeah.

2780
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:32,100
That's a real classic one.

2781
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,190
Did you ever get a chance to
hear Rodney Dangerfield perform?

2782
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:37,070
I've been telling you about there.

2783
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,150
Have you seen any like
the old time grades?

2784
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,770
Have you ever seen any of them wanting me?

2785
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,610
I've watched Rodney doing his stand up.

2786
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:43,560
I mean you meet in person,

2787
01:13:43,561 --> 01:13:43,740
right?

2788
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:44,431
See Carlin at all?

2789
01:13:44,431 --> 01:13:45,030
Yeah.

2790
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:45,751
Never in person.

2791
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:46,584
Ever in person.

2792
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,420
I was fucking missed a Rickles too.

2793
01:13:50,421 --> 01:13:51,540
Last time I was in Montreal.

2794
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:52,590
I want to go see wrinkles.

2795
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,640
He's still performing.

2796
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:54,030
Huh?

2797
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:54,521
I overeat.

2798
01:13:54,521 --> 01:13:54,691
Yeah.

2799
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:55,130
I,

2800
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,760
I had asked to be on too many shows.

2801
01:13:56,761 --> 01:13:57,720
I'm never doing that again.

2802
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:58,440
Montreal.

2803
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:58,591
Yeah.

2804
01:13:58,591 --> 01:13:59,940
Cause I wanted to go see some other shit.

2805
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:00,450
Yeah.

2806
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:01,680
I keep thinking I want to do spots,

2807
01:14:01,681 --> 01:14:01,951
you know,

2808
01:14:01,951 --> 01:14:04,590
and then I just have too
many and it's not as fine.

2809
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,221
Well,

2810
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:07,260
if you have a lot in a
nice place like Montreal,

2811
01:14:07,261 --> 01:14:09,120
you're not going to get
to explore the city too.

2812
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:10,080
That's a,

2813
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,100
that's a whole nother world.

2814
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,943
That city.

2815
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,641
I like it.

2816
01:14:12,641 --> 01:14:13,001
Damn man.

2817
01:14:13,001 --> 01:14:13,341
The summer.

2818
01:14:13,341 --> 01:14:14,040
It's great.

2819
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:14,873
Love it there.

2820
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:16,450
It's a whole nother world though.

2821
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:21,480
I mean that is a French
speaking international city
that is just above main,

2822
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:27,020
like it doesn't make any god damn sense
because Maine is like desolate waste

2823
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:29,680
land and trees.

2824
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:31,780
Dudes with coonskin hat,

2825
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:32,621
you know,

2826
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:36,160
looking at you from behind a
fucking Bush is why I got from,

2827
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:40,570
you're not from around here with
your buddy in the Stephen King books,

2828
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,160
you know that's all based on Maine.

2829
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:43,061
Yeah.

2830
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,590
They've inspired more horror,

2831
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:47,260
horror stories with their
faces than any other people.

2832
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:51,910
I've never been in a place where you
make fun of the state and people go more

2833
01:14:51,911 --> 01:14:53,410
fucking angry.

2834
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:53,720
Oh,

2835
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,420
you get may get furious.

2836
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,910
They call the maniacs that they're,

2837
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:58,690
they're maniacs.

2838
01:14:58,690 --> 01:14:59,770
Strongest suite I've ever had.

2839
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:04,771
I gotten made from some Hick was
dude fuck God damn challenge dude.

2840
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:05,440
And I,

2841
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,400
if I could ever find it again,

2842
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:11,401
it was like a dense fucking bud that
almost smelled like a car freshener.

2843
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:13,060
It wasn't like delicious.

2844
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:16,990
We'd smell really and it was so fucking
strong and we were not prepared for how

2845
01:15:16,991 --> 01:15:18,160
strong it was at all.

2846
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,233
I couldn't book,

2847
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:22,060
I like to smoke it again cause
I have a different palette now,

2848
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:26,500
but we were all like out
of our minds and his weed.

2849
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,770
Well couldn't you think that if
you were a dude living in some,

2850
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:32,170
in the middle of nowhere
town and a place like Maine,

2851
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:36,910
you could be like some crazy hacker guy
who makes his own computers and designs

2852
01:15:36,911 --> 01:15:38,590
his own drones and shit like that.

2853
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:42,070
You could see some mad scientist dude
living by himself like that out there.

2854
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:42,904
Right,

2855
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:43,540
right.

2856
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,940
Well couldn't you see a mad botness too?

2857
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:46,811
Yeah,

2858
01:15:46,811 --> 01:15:50,200
I could totally see that as well until
they see some crazy fuck that's out there

2859
01:15:50,201 --> 01:15:50,701
and oppression.

2860
01:15:50,701 --> 01:15:52,450
It was some white wild ass,

2861
01:15:52,451 --> 01:15:52,781
you know,

2862
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:52,990
they,

2863
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:55,510
he planted it in the woods
with traps around it,

2864
01:15:55,511 --> 01:15:56,111
kind of weed.

2865
01:15:56,111 --> 01:15:56,590
You know,

2866
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:57,410
that's how they do.

2867
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:57,660
They,

2868
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:00,340
they go out in the woods and make
their little stet grows and uh,

2869
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:01,800
but we travel.

2870
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:02,291
But yeah,

2871
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,124
that makes sense.

2872
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:05,890
But it also makes sense that
like someone in this day and age,

2873
01:16:05,891 --> 01:16:06,790
it's about how long ago was it?

2874
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:07,660
You got this weed,

2875
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:10,180
she didn't want to to go
over 10 years ago at least.

2876
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:10,780
Well,

2877
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:14,840
since 1994 they've had medical marijuana
in California I think was in 94 does

2878
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:15,683
that past.

2879
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,300
So from then on Shit's
been pretty commensurate.

2880
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:19,710
I mean,

2881
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,250
I don't think it's gotten much stronger.

2882
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,740
I had some weed in the
late nineties it was just,

2883
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,020
I've,

2884
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:24,591
I've had weeds.

2885
01:16:24,591 --> 01:16:26,260
It's just as strong as
shit you're getting today.

2886
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:27,880
So if some guy got it to him,

2887
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:28,690
you know,

2888
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:32,470
2005 somebody got it to him all the
way up in Maine just starts growing it.

2889
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,520
That's totally feasible.

2890
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:34,533
Or you know,

2891
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:35,403
you're out.

2892
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:38,920
Well you just sprayed it with
like bug spray or something?

2893
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:39,933
I don't think so.

2894
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:40,953
Just pissed on it.

2895
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:42,220
His drink eats a lot of vitamins.

2896
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,600
The vitamin PICE,

2897
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:45,910
I eat my fighter shot today.

2898
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:48,730
That's what my point was like.

2899
01:16:48,731 --> 01:16:51,670
That's a very loosely populated state,

2900
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:52,271
you know,

2901
01:16:52,271 --> 01:16:53,350
and there's a couple cool cities,

2902
01:16:53,351 --> 01:16:55,780
like Bangor is a cool city
and Portland's a cool city,

2903
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,170
but you go north of that and
there was virtually nothing.

2904
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,220
They just really,

2905
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:04,990
really small towns of beat people
barely eking by north of that is this

2906
01:17:04,991 --> 01:17:06,820
incredible fucking city.

2907
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:08,163
It's nuts.

2908
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,830
I'm saying just keep going.

2909
01:17:09,831 --> 01:17:10,010
So you

2910
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,360
get past the wildlings and
you get to the front desk.

2911
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,530
You got to climb the fence.

2912
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:18,050
So weird that you guys are
talking about Portland.

2913
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,020
I'm actually planning all
these places right now.

2914
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,160
You'd probably talk about Portland,

2915
01:17:22,161 --> 01:17:22,580
Oregon.

2916
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:23,450
I'm talking about Portland,

2917
01:17:23,451 --> 01:17:23,840
Maine,

2918
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,171
Portland,

2919
01:17:24,171 --> 01:17:25,004
Maine,

2920
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:25,761
Maine,

2921
01:17:25,761 --> 01:17:26,361
Somerville,

2922
01:17:26,361 --> 01:17:27,620
Massachusetts,

2923
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,341
Somerville.

2924
01:17:28,341 --> 01:17:28,700
Yeah.

2925
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,680
And Rhode Island.

2926
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:34,520
Savo rod is stolen during
the common connection.

2927
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:35,413
That's a great spot.

2928
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:36,621
I used to do that.

2929
01:17:36,621 --> 01:17:37,100
It's adult,

2930
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:37,933
a bank vault.

2931
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:39,423
That's what it,

2932
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:40,670
if it's the same location,

2933
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,290
it used to be literally a bank fault.

2934
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:45,320
The green room for a
comedian was the vault.

2935
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:46,490
The place was a bang.

2936
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,120
Wow.

2937
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:47,960
But it was terrible.

2938
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,340
Like the one thing about it that was
terrible was that you had these giant

2939
01:17:52,341 --> 01:17:53,750
ceilings cause it was like a bank.

2940
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,673
Oh right.

2941
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:55,280
And you're,

2942
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,990
but you were on stage in a bank.

2943
01:17:56,991 --> 01:17:59,150
I mean it used to be a bank and
it's like a bank parking lot.

2944
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:01,640
I got the worst food poisoning
my life in that place.

2945
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,220
Like in the year two,

2946
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:06,200
not even 99 or something like that.

2947
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,400
I don't even know what year it was.

2948
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,770
You eat that poisoned you a pizza.

2949
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,640
You know when you eat Sushi
and he'd get a poisoning,

2950
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:16,560
it's usually not the fish because
they have to freeze the fish first.

2951
01:18:16,561 --> 01:18:20,720
That's usually the rice that
rice is like people's hands.

2952
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:21,290
Yeah.

2953
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:22,760
They say that about a salad.

2954
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,580
The salad is one of the worst things
that people get food poisoning from.

2955
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:26,414
Imagine that.

2956
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:27,440
Trying to be all healthy.

2957
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:29,450
Like I don't want to use toxic meat.

2958
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:33,090
I'll sit here and eat my
micro been festival lettuce.

2959
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:34,461
But,

2960
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:34,850
um,

2961
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:35,810
Montreal,

2962
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:36,411
if you go,

2963
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:36,591
like,

2964
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:38,840
if it's counterintuitive
because if you are like,

2965
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:40,880
if you were headed north and you,

2966
01:18:40,881 --> 01:18:41,181
you know,

2967
01:18:41,181 --> 01:18:44,240
you went all through New
York and Massachusetts and
you got up to me and he'd be

2968
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:44,331
like,

2969
01:18:44,331 --> 01:18:44,571
okay,

2970
01:18:44,571 --> 01:18:45,440
we've got to turn around.

2971
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:47,460
There's nothing up here cause nothing.

2972
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,030
But if you just kept going

2973
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:49,531
be like,

2974
01:18:49,531 --> 01:18:50,820
Whoa,

2975
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,260
this is better than Boston.

2976
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:53,490
This is a magical city.

2977
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:54,900
This is beautiful.

2978
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:57,090
Everybody taught there
are different languages.

2979
01:18:57,510 --> 01:18:58,380
Not better than Boston,

2980
01:18:59,170 --> 01:18:59,630
but it's,

2981
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:00,960
it's similar.

2982
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:01,920
Yeah,

2983
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:02,740
I love it there.

2984
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:02,931
No,

2985
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:03,721
Montreal's a shit.

2986
01:19:03,721 --> 01:19:04,850
Toronto's a shit too.

2987
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,590
You have a good time to Toronto to yeah,

2988
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:09,570
it's like a big city but they're nice,

2989
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:10,560
weird.

2990
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,311
The crowds are good.

2991
01:19:11,311 --> 01:19:16,311
I can see I Canadian like kind
of Pc people are different
cause you know what it

2992
01:19:16,411 --> 01:19:16,591
is.

2993
01:19:16,591 --> 01:19:17,610
They'll hear you out.

2994
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:19,830
All my jokes are overly wordy too,

2995
01:19:19,831 --> 01:19:23,160
so you've got to like hear me out before
you get mad or it's not going to work.

2996
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,340
But they're Canadian.

2997
01:19:24,341 --> 01:19:26,250
So their attention span
is just like longer.

2998
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:28,200
And when I fuck up here,

2999
01:19:28,201 --> 01:19:31,560
it's because somebody was half listening
and just heard a word and didn't know

3000
01:19:31,561 --> 01:19:32,394
what I was saying.

3001
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:33,370
Outrage,

3002
01:19:33,370 --> 01:19:33,930
attack dude.

3003
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:36,300
I got a girl dumped a
drink on me at the seller.

3004
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:37,230
Why?

3005
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:41,880
I can say this is all my hour and a
white precious children of gay marriage.

3006
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:42,800
Archie hour.

3007
01:19:42,801 --> 01:19:43,020
She,

3008
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:43,160
no,

3009
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:43,231
no,

3010
01:19:43,231 --> 01:19:44,880
no this but it's on my hour.

3011
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:45,714
If he was on my own.

3012
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:46,643
But she goes,

3013
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,690
she comes is the beginning of the thing.

3014
01:19:48,691 --> 01:19:51,870
I asked if there are for gay marriage
and I go cause I'm against it.

3015
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:53,940
That's why I brought it up
and this is the first line,

3016
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:54,720
right.

3017
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,560
But if you listen to the joke,

3018
01:19:55,561 --> 01:19:56,960
it's clearly a pro gay marriage show,

3019
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:57,960
but she just ran up,

3020
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,610
grabbed some other guys drink.

3021
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:00,511
It wasn't her drink.

3022
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,690
She picked up a dude's strength in
front of her and doused me with it.

3023
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,400
And then they're starting to pull her out.

3024
01:20:05,401 --> 01:20:05,641
I'm like,

3025
01:20:05,641 --> 01:20:05,941
Whoa,

3026
01:20:05,941 --> 01:20:07,740
what just why did you do that?

3027
01:20:07,741 --> 01:20:08,400
And she's like,

3028
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,050
you're against gay marriage.

3029
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:12,060
Is that crate?

3030
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:12,893
I like,

3031
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:13,471
first of all,

3032
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:16,350
the joke was pro that
and then also was a joke.

3033
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,530
It's about like,

3034
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,740
why we can't have it
here because you know,

3035
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,280
we have a constitution
God gave us and like,

3036
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:24,110
Oh,

3037
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:24,390
you know,

3038
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:25,380
we lose protection.

3039
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:26,910
Like he watches your holes,

3040
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:27,960
you know?

3041
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:28,280
Right.

3042
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,360
Like a diamond loop

3043
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,800
and see what they're up to.

3044
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:34,560
Look at that.

3045
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,550
More protection for you.

3046
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:36,360
Um,

3047
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,890
so what did she say?

3048
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,930
Cause I'm against gay marriage.

3049
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:42,870
But did you explain to her that you
were going and this is a satire?

3050
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:44,390
No,

3051
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:44,981
they'll bounce her,

3052
01:20:44,981 --> 01:20:45,450
threw her out.

3053
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:47,670
I was trying to make her
stay actually so I could,

3054
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:49,800
it was so shocking that it happened.

3055
01:20:49,801 --> 01:20:50,760
I wasn't like mad,

3056
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:53,520
but that's exactly what
we're talking about.

3057
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:56,400
We're talking about people
that have a black or white.

3058
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:57,210
There's a,

3059
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:57,720
you know,

3060
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,270
there's a,

3061
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:58,410
yeah,

3062
01:20:58,410 --> 01:20:59,280
I'm not proud of you.

3063
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:03,210
That's why we all supposedly hated
George W for his moral certitude.

3064
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,100
So I don't want to hear yours.

3065
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,320
Especially not in satire,

3066
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,060
especially not when you're
going to see a comedy show.

3067
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:10,620
I'm above the law is how I,

3068
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,060
my attitude towards comedy,

3069
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:14,760
whatever the fucking a social norm is,

3070
01:21:14,761 --> 01:21:15,810
I'm above that.

3071
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:17,220
That's why I took this job.

3072
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:19,860
I took this job to not do what you do.

3073
01:21:19,861 --> 01:21:21,540
I don't work at your fucking office,

3074
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,840
so I'll have to clean it up
like we're at the office.

3075
01:21:24,841 --> 01:21:25,180
Do you want me,

3076
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,490
people think that that's the way you're
supposed to think and talk all the time.

3077
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:31,260
Because they all think
they're comics to that.

3078
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,160
Jon Stewart said that,

3079
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,120
that like,

3080
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:33,361
you know,

3081
01:21:33,361 --> 01:21:36,270
people would play music that's
magical to people and painting.

3082
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:37,140
That's magic.

3083
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:38,940
But everyone thinks they're a comedian.

3084
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:40,140
They all think they are.

3085
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,450
So that's why they feel
qualified to tell you.

3086
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:42,761
Well,

3087
01:21:42,761 --> 01:21:43,710
because they talk,

3088
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,100
right?

3089
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,570
You don't see it as being much different.

3090
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:47,370
You're talking and they're talking.

3091
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:48,080
Oh,

3092
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,230
people used to say about stern.

3093
01:21:49,231 --> 01:21:49,561
They'd be like,

3094
01:21:49,561 --> 01:21:50,040
oh,

3095
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:50,521
I could do I.

3096
01:21:50,521 --> 01:21:52,290
Which stores do you just
go talk about bossy?

3097
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:52,920
You know,

3098
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,790
like that attitude.

3099
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:54,900
That's what they think it is.

3100
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:57,450
So when they talk about mean jokes,

3101
01:21:57,630 --> 01:21:59,970
they're not thinking of someone
crafting something clever.

3102
01:21:59,971 --> 01:22:00,720
They think of,

3103
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:01,021
Oh,

3104
01:22:01,021 --> 01:22:02,430
you're a lesbian,

3105
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:03,750
like in their head.

3106
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:04,740
That's the same as a joke.

3107
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:06,660
We don't even agree on what jokes are.

3108
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:08,210
But to even have that argument about that,

3109
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:10,000
well it seems easier than it really is.

3110
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:13,080
And it seems like you're just
a guy who was talking about um,

3111
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,220
it does,

3112
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:14,521
right?

3113
01:22:14,521 --> 01:22:14,830
It does.

3114
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:15,870
It seems what I thought,

3115
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:17,850
I thought it was real
fucking easy for I did it.

3116
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:19,110
I thought that too,

3117
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:24,140
even about podcasting because podcasting
also made me really understand and

3118
01:22:24,841 --> 01:22:29,160
appreciate conversations
because conversations are
like a little dance between

3119
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,113
robot Dick

3120
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,890
pump conversations are a
little dance between people.

3121
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,120
There's even a 10.

3122
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:37,170
There's a marine to do it.

3123
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,600
People don't always sync
up that good with it.

3124
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:40,650
Like sometimes people,

3125
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,030
it's awkward,

3126
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:42,391
you know,

3127
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:45,090
with some folks it's an art form though.

3128
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:45,750
Look Dude,

3129
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,370
I didn't realize how radio,

3130
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:49,950
like it's the same as like comedy when I,

3131
01:22:49,951 --> 01:22:52,770
when I would start to have
to be on people's radio
shows and I realized there's

3132
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:53,730
like a thing to it.

3133
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:55,320
I just always assumed,

3134
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:56,310
um,

3135
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:56,820
fuck.

3136
01:22:56,820 --> 01:23:00,390
I was definitely a thing
to being entertaining when
you're having a long form

3137
01:23:00,391 --> 01:23:01,201
conversation,

3138
01:23:01,201 --> 01:23:04,200
you know the people that think that would
be easy to keep a conversation going.

3139
01:23:04,201 --> 01:23:06,040
I've never done it to know what's

3140
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,731
the comedian saying?

3141
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:07,331
I'm so high.

3142
01:23:07,331 --> 01:23:09,640
What's the comedian's name
that just passed away from mom?

3143
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:10,660
The last boy scout.

3144
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:11,830
He was on my show twice.

3145
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:12,850
Fast boy scout.

3146
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:13,211
Yeah,

3147
01:23:13,211 --> 01:23:13,960
he's in every movie.

3148
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,460
He's from a punchline.

3149
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,230
The guy go and add a yard dog.

3150
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:20,650
I don't have no idea who taught fine.

3151
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:21,320
I forget his name.

3152
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,240
I'm a comedian.

3153
01:23:22,241 --> 01:23:23,500
Just passed away and he's my friend.

3154
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:23,871
I'm telling you.

3155
01:23:23,871 --> 01:23:24,221
So Hi,

3156
01:23:24,221 --> 01:23:24,671
I'm blank.

3157
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:26,080
And he came on the show twice.

3158
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:27,400
Um,

3159
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:31,000
fucking [inaudible] and he's like in
everything in the 80s he's an all these

3160
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:32,210
eighties matters do come in.

3161
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:33,131
No,

3162
01:23:33,131 --> 01:23:36,370
he's a kind of swore the swarthy move on.

3163
01:23:36,371 --> 01:23:37,360
I'm gonna look them up right now.

3164
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:37,500
No,

3165
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:38,333
it is Jeremy.

3166
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:38,651
Yeah,

3167
01:23:38,651 --> 01:23:39,330
Taylor Taylor.

3168
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:40,163
Negra.

3169
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:41,463
These are strong,

3170
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,300
that guy.

3171
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,930
So he came on my podcast twice.

3172
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:45,670
That guy was so fucking good.

3173
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,430
Like that's all where I know
him from coming on there.

3174
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:51,700
He would just wait for his part to jump
in and then he had something funny and

3175
01:23:51,701 --> 01:23:55,630
interesting to say and he'd jump
out and it was just amazing.

3176
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:59,620
Like he just dancing and it was never in
somebody's way and it was always worth

3177
01:23:59,621 --> 01:24:00,790
like paying attention to like,

3178
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:02,320
I thought he was like really killer.

3179
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:03,490
There's a good dude too.

3180
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:05,130
I used to always run
into him at the Improv.

3181
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:05,411
Very,

3182
01:24:05,411 --> 01:24:06,011
very nice guy.

3183
01:24:06,011 --> 01:24:06,844
Very Fun guy.

3184
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:07,301
Yeah,

3185
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:08,530
he was one of the coolest guys.

3186
01:24:08,531 --> 01:24:09,780
I only met him like breezy,

3187
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:12,250
but like I really liked them and
I really want him to come back.

3188
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:14,890
I had no idea he had cancer or anything.

3189
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:16,873
Oh,

3190
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:20,470
somehow in another,

3191
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,940
it's better than suicide,

3192
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:22,480
you know?

3193
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,550
That's the bummer when a
guy like Robin Williams,

3194
01:24:24,551 --> 01:24:26,350
Richard Jail Somehow or another,

3195
01:24:26,351 --> 01:24:27,131
that to me is like,

3196
01:24:27,131 --> 01:24:27,821
God damn it.

3197
01:24:27,821 --> 01:24:29,320
Somebody didn't get to
those dudes in time,

3198
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,160
you know?

3199
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:30,431
Well,

3200
01:24:30,431 --> 01:24:31,170
it's an IRA.

3201
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:32,530
It's got to be some
kind of mental illness,

3202
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:32,771
right,

3203
01:24:32,771 --> 01:24:34,720
because you're supposed to
be wired not to do that.

3204
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:35,261
Oh yeah,

3205
01:24:35,261 --> 01:24:36,850
a hundred percent depression wired.

3206
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:37,360
By the way.

3207
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,710
Everybody says wired like,

3208
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:39,790
where's my wires?

3209
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,900
Like the Internet is tubes.

3210
01:24:40,901 --> 01:24:45,280
It's the same level of stupid
cause just is the way we're wired.

3211
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:46,203
It's not tubes,

3212
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:47,403
but is it,

3213
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:49,420
I mean there's something
that goes across the ocean,

3214
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:50,171
which is new to me.

3215
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:50,741
Tapes and tunnel.

3216
01:24:50,741 --> 01:24:52,930
So I know fiber optic lines.

3217
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:56,290
I didn't know they had to lay lines
across the entire fucking actual ocean.

3218
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:56,561
I was like,

3219
01:24:56,561 --> 01:24:56,951
wait a minute.

3220
01:24:56,951 --> 01:24:58,390
I thought we were Wifi by now.

3221
01:24:58,950 --> 01:24:59,890
That's ridiculous.

3222
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:03,160
But that's how we connect to
the other parts of the world.

3223
01:25:03,161 --> 01:25:08,161
They have a tube right to water
the seeds of tubes essentially.

3224
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:09,390
But it's,

3225
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:09,610
you know,

3226
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:10,970
like if you ask the average person,

3227
01:25:10,971 --> 01:25:13,540
he uses the Internet to put up
Instagram pics of their ass.

3228
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:15,250
How exactly is this getting to Sweden?

3229
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:18,430
Because someone in Sweden right now
is downloading your Instagram feed.

3230
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:23,670
Someone is looking at your butt pictures
while you're doing squats and these are

3231
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:25,000
like a snapchat thing,

3232
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:26,830
putting your butt up like that.

3233
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:30,370
I thought snapchats fat to get your dig
up and then it goes away after a few

3234
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:30,491
minutes we'll,

3235
01:25:30,491 --> 01:25:31,271
snapchat does.

3236
01:25:31,271 --> 01:25:32,081
But Instagram,

3237
01:25:32,081 --> 01:25:36,160
there's girls that have literally millions
and millions of followers and they're

3238
01:25:36,161 --> 01:25:40,270
just girls in yoga pants and all
they do all day is like squat.

3239
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:41,163
That's my new,

3240
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,130
how's the new port search?

3241
01:25:43,131 --> 01:25:44,620
I've been using yoga pants.

3242
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:46,330
That's the porn search.

3243
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:47,171
The dogs,

3244
01:25:47,171 --> 01:25:48,001
my new wine.

3245
01:25:48,001 --> 01:25:50,650
Am I dead soul of having to
find something to amuse me?

3246
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:53,740
What will make my Dick to anything new?

3247
01:25:53,741 --> 01:25:55,600
Shit that Jack took her pants.

3248
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,390
There's something about a girl who's
like really spiritual that still wants to

3249
01:25:58,391 --> 01:26:00,040
fuck guys get very excited.

3250
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:01,420
Plus it's tight.

3251
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:04,150
So it kind of compress the pants
can be really always ripped

3252
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,000
the pants open.

3253
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:05,270
Oh,

3254
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:05,721
crazy.

3255
01:26:05,721 --> 01:26:08,500
Like violent but little consent.

3256
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:09,451
She said,

3257
01:26:09,451 --> 01:26:12,230
so may I rip your pants
open or does this discussed?

3258
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:14,270
I think it's important cause I'm not,

3259
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:15,410
I'm not jerking off to rape.

3260
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,930
I mean she doesn't turn
her face away from it.

3261
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:18,351
She's not,

3262
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:19,071
he's right into it.

3263
01:26:19,071 --> 01:26:19,940
I think that's consent.

3264
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:21,260
I don't think you understand consent.

3265
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,670
There's a part of the problem,

3266
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:25,180
percent of communication is nonverbal.

3267
01:26:25,181 --> 01:26:26,120
So how I feel about it?

3268
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:27,140
You are cisgender.

3269
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:28,583
Yeah,

3270
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:30,140
Dude.

3271
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:30,973
Fuck yes,

3272
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:32,820
you're cisgendered.

3273
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:33,070
Um,

3274
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:34,610
so therefore a privileged,

3275
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,590
do not apologize for your very existence.

3276
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:37,420
He probably will.

3277
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:38,840
That's like the original sin now,

3278
01:26:38,841 --> 01:26:39,620
right?

3279
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:40,600
That's your new flux.

3280
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:41,810
Yes.

3281
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:46,130
Sin when he just amongst a very small
chains to go that full circle to like

3282
01:26:46,131 --> 01:26:50,690
trying to get away from the circumstances
of your birth and now it's fully that

3283
01:26:50,691 --> 01:26:55,160
now like first we judge you by what your
category is before you say anything.

3284
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,900
So now two different things.

3285
01:26:56,901 --> 01:26:57,500
Me,

3286
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:58,041
it's different.

3287
01:26:58,041 --> 01:26:59,450
If he says it,

3288
01:26:59,451 --> 01:27:00,410
then you said it.

3289
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:00,561
Well,

3290
01:27:00,561 --> 01:27:02,050
it's like that video that you were,

3291
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:04,460
were listening to that Jamie was doing,

3292
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:07,640
were you on the opie and Anthony show
that I was telling you about it where it's

3293
01:27:07,641 --> 01:27:07,850
like,

3294
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:08,331
that's what you're,

3295
01:27:08,331 --> 01:27:10,310
you guys are like mocking that very thing.

3296
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:10,641
Right,

3297
01:27:10,641 --> 01:27:10,851
right,

3298
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:11,684
right.

3299
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:12,261
I,

3300
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:12,890
uh,

3301
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:13,640
he's the,

3302
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,250
his videos are the best God,

3303
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:21,270
the amazing tone as if he's like patiently
talking to a fucking waterhead Gil

3304
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,760
[inaudible] to you.

3305
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:24,230
How you should react.

3306
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:25,820
Okay guys,

3307
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:27,140
that's the entire sense of humor.

3308
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:27,974
They have to,

3309
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:28,671
it's like,

3310
01:27:28,671 --> 01:27:29,270
you know,

3311
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:32,000
someone raising one eyebrow
over their glasses at you.

3312
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:33,613
Really?

3313
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,910
That's their little like,

3314
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,111
like a polite,

3315
01:27:36,111 --> 01:27:37,790
like a disdain or a,

3316
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,490
I don't know.

3317
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:39,770
Describe that sled nerd.

3318
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:43,430
A contemptuous nerd is the
new kind of sense of humor.

3319
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:44,810
But this is a big audience for that.

3320
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:45,351
Yeah.

3321
01:27:45,351 --> 01:27:46,310
For like eye rolling.

3322
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,650
I was like just professional.

3323
01:27:48,651 --> 01:27:53,651
I really ever saw pot and pan
has some great joke about a,

3324
01:27:54,421 --> 01:27:58,220
an altercation that happens in a Starbucks
in Los Filez where he says you could

3325
01:27:58,221 --> 01:28:01,590
barely hear the Nora Jones
song from the Saturday Aioli

3326
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:08,770
is drowning.

3327
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:09,570
Yes.

3328
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:11,280
That was really slow description of,

3329
01:28:11,281 --> 01:28:11,750
of,

3330
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,710
of reality.

3331
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,150
It's so funny.

3332
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:15,670
That is so vibrant,

3333
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:18,320
but it's like that attitude bad.

3334
01:28:18,321 --> 01:28:19,420
It's like you don't,

3335
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:21,420
it's all de this is Duh.

3336
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:21,721
Right,

3337
01:28:21,721 --> 01:28:23,360
but you talking to
five-year-old's cause you,

3338
01:28:23,361 --> 01:28:24,194
you should need,

3339
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:25,370
need to have a kid.

3340
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:31,180
But that's what's so irritating about.

3341
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:32,023
And also,

3342
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:32,451
well,

3343
01:28:32,451 --> 01:28:32,871
I don't have,

3344
01:28:32,871 --> 01:28:35,660
they're confusing the role of comedy,

3345
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:36,883
like comedy.

3346
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,400
I guess it can be a tool for
whatever can be that doesn't,

3347
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:41,810
it's not what it is.

3348
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:44,210
You're not Batman with this.

3349
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:44,380
Yeah.

3350
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:45,380
You're the joker.

3351
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:47,410
Babby is serious.

3352
01:28:47,411 --> 01:28:47,720
You're a,

3353
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:48,590
you're a comedian.

3354
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:50,630
You're the gene I trying to do good.

3355
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:53,460
You trying to show Batman not
to take shit so seriously.

3356
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,040
If you are trying to,

3357
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:56,750
you should have a real point like,

3358
01:28:56,751 --> 01:28:57,260
hey,

3359
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:01,530
here's something I found out about
that you need to make a drug with drug.

3360
01:29:01,531 --> 01:29:02,640
It will fucking kill you,

3361
01:29:02,641 --> 01:29:03,474
my friend.

3362
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,390
You could take your points and,

3363
01:29:05,391 --> 01:29:07,140
and put them in joke form,

3364
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:08,820
which is what your actual job is.

3365
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:10,440
You guys will just cover go.

3366
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,010
My sister's anti gay and
I think that's wrong.

3367
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:15,090
Great Job Jamie.

3368
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,250
You fucking rarely does he do that.

3369
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:20,700
He did that on fucking Conan or something.

3370
01:29:20,701 --> 01:29:21,630
What is something he was on?

3371
01:29:21,631 --> 01:29:22,021
I was just like,

3372
01:29:22,021 --> 01:29:22,854
not a joke.

3373
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:25,440
It's just him fucking preachings
and he retired though.

3374
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:26,423
He's done right.

3375
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:27,263
He's done with cotton.

3376
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,600
I heard he retired really well.

3377
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,860
Somebody tweeted I it
might just be temporary.

3378
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:34,410
What's he gonna do for
money then to sand radio.

3379
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:36,810
But he did he try to get you fired?

3380
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:37,711
No.

3381
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:37,941
But,

3382
01:29:37,941 --> 01:29:38,100
uh,

3383
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:38,520
he,

3384
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,290
he like threw in his own like,

3385
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:40,711
yeah.

3386
01:29:40,711 --> 01:29:41,191
Something,

3387
01:29:41,191 --> 01:29:45,040
but it was mainly that one girl whose
name I don't imagine good for you and

3388
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:46,350
fucking good for you.

3389
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:46,651
But,

3390
01:29:46,651 --> 01:29:47,484
uh,

3391
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:47,950
the,

3392
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:48,661
I don't know,

3393
01:29:48,661 --> 01:29:49,140
man.

3394
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:53,640
I just hate comics turning on
each other like that over jokes.

3395
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:57,720
It's like the idea that you
were pretending you don't
know the guy's fucking

3396
01:29:57,721 --> 01:29:58,860
around and that that's an art.

3397
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:02,460
There's an art form to go in
and see a guy who sang things.

3398
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:03,390
You absolutely know.

3399
01:30:03,391 --> 01:30:04,410
He doesn't really believe.

3400
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:04,951
Well,

3401
01:30:04,951 --> 01:30:05,670
look,

3402
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:07,320
you have to your look.

3403
01:30:07,321 --> 01:30:09,030
I've kind of that fight already with,

3404
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,233
you know,

3405
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:13,440
and the bottom line is
everything's propaganda.

3406
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:14,900
I remember this whole mindset,

3407
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:15,240
dude,

3408
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,400
everything is like church.

3409
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:16,980
Yeah.

3410
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:17,940
I know that mindset.

3411
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:21,090
Like what kind of world
are you working for it?

3412
01:30:21,091 --> 01:30:22,080
These chokes Joe.

3413
01:30:22,081 --> 01:30:22,441
I mean,

3414
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:23,310
think about that.

3415
01:30:23,311 --> 01:30:24,110
You know,

3416
01:30:24,110 --> 01:30:24,680
like,

3417
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,280
like we weren't supposed to stumble.

3418
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:29,190
I was talking about on
Marin's show the fucking like,

3419
01:30:29,191 --> 01:30:31,950
you couldn't stumble your
brother out of Christianity.

3420
01:30:31,951 --> 01:30:33,000
That was like a big no,

3421
01:30:33,001 --> 01:30:33,301
no.

3422
01:30:33,301 --> 01:30:33,841
In my church.

3423
01:30:33,841 --> 01:30:34,591
So let's,

3424
01:30:34,591 --> 01:30:35,490
I know your brother.

3425
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:35,681
Yeah.

3426
01:30:35,681 --> 01:30:35,881
Like,

3427
01:30:35,881 --> 01:30:39,540
let's say you had some doubts about
something that you heard and like doctrine

3428
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,720
and you set it to your brother
Rogan and brother row goes like,

3429
01:30:42,721 --> 01:30:42,901
yeah,

3430
01:30:42,901 --> 01:30:43,770
that sounds like bullshit.

3431
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:44,820
I'm leaving this church.

3432
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,400
You stumbled him out of
the faith with your shit.

3433
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:50,630
You're supposed to humbly just
assume that whatever it is,

3434
01:30:50,631 --> 01:30:53,400
we'll get worked out and not
really make a stink about it.

3435
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:54,780
Even if you didn't agree with something,

3436
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:55,621
you go like,

3437
01:30:55,621 --> 01:30:55,861
well,

3438
01:30:55,861 --> 01:30:57,120
they know what's for the best.

3439
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:58,441
That's actively,

3440
01:30:58,441 --> 01:30:59,250
you're supposed to do that.

3441
01:30:59,250 --> 01:30:59,940
Okay,

3442
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:01,140
so these people at the same thing,

3443
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:05,160
but by you making some crass joke about
something that's serious that people

3444
01:31:05,161 --> 01:31:05,994
don't take seriously enough,

3445
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,050
you're contributing.

3446
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:12,590
You understand the same way hip hop is
making young black men because of the hip

3447
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:14,040
hop or fucking,

3448
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:14,470
well,

3449
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:14,670
it's,

3450
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:18,180
it's the same fucking argument or how
dungeons and dragons is encouraging the

3451
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:20,160
suicide or when it's the season.

3452
01:31:20,161 --> 01:31:21,240
It's an old argument.

3453
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:22,570
Does anybody really say that?

3454
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,900
What the dungeons and dragons,

3455
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:27,600
don't you remember that in the eighties
dungeon dragons leads to suicide,

3456
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:29,880
a demon ism and fucking,

3457
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:31,890
there's always a thing
that you got to blame.

3458
01:31:31,890 --> 01:31:36,540
I'm telling you jokes one way or another
are never going to affect anything for

3459
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:37,111
anything.

3460
01:31:37,111 --> 01:31:38,790
Like don't worry about the jokes.

3461
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:43,920
You know the people who think Bush got
elected because of SNLs portrayal of Bush

3462
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,900
versus their portrayal of Gore.

3463
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:46,650
I've heard people,

3464
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:46,831
oh,

3465
01:31:46,831 --> 01:31:47,341
what's his name,

3466
01:31:47,341 --> 01:31:49,290
who was on a Horatio Sanz said it.

3467
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:53,820
He thought the election got affected
by my will Ferrell doing Bush that you

3468
01:31:53,821 --> 01:31:53,941
know,

3469
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:54,751
condescending.

3470
01:31:54,751 --> 01:31:55,380
That is,

3471
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:56,191
I think he's funny too.

3472
01:31:56,191 --> 01:31:56,920
Like I'm not against it,

3473
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,020
but that's the most,

3474
01:31:58,090 --> 01:31:58,340
that's,

3475
01:31:58,340 --> 01:31:59,173
that's how they,

3476
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:00,850
they're so condescending.

3477
01:32:00,851 --> 01:32:05,500
They imagine people were
swayed by Saturday night
live and people are so stupid

3478
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:05,981
that they need,

3479
01:32:05,981 --> 01:32:08,320
they're gentle fucking lefty hands.

3480
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:09,640
Do you understand?

3481
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:09,851
Yeah,

3482
01:32:09,851 --> 01:32:13,480
but hold on a second because you're
talking to me from a guy who used to be a

3483
01:32:13,481 --> 01:32:14,770
fucking Jehovah's witness.

3484
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:18,310
So you're talking about an entire religion
that believes unbelievably retarded

3485
01:32:18,311 --> 01:32:19,144
nonsense.

3486
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:20,200
And you're surprised,

3487
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:24,850
but you're surprised that a
portrayal by someone of a,

3488
01:32:24,851 --> 01:32:28,090
a president could influence
people that watch television.

3489
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:31,840
I don't think anyone's switched their
vote because they saw jokes about you can

3490
01:32:31,841 --> 01:32:33,550
make it that possible though.

3491
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,490
Not a ball point.

3492
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:34,860
No,

3493
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:36,100
I don't think they're responsible.

3494
01:32:36,101 --> 01:32:37,050
I don't think the person's response,

3495
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:37,430
look,

3496
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:38,290
people are retarded,

3497
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:38,560
dude.

3498
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:43,300
I don't think you could sway someone
who was people who voted for Bush.

3499
01:32:43,301 --> 01:32:44,134
We're into.

3500
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:45,010
Okay,

3501
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:45,843
and that,

3502
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,170
that ideology,

3503
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,320
the people's Idi,

3504
01:32:48,321 --> 01:32:49,370
it's the same as he's left.

3505
01:32:49,371 --> 01:32:49,691
He's like,

3506
01:32:49,691 --> 01:32:52,000
you wouldn't joke them
out of believing in shit.

3507
01:32:52,001 --> 01:32:54,070
They believe if the dumbest outliers,

3508
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:55,030
it's possible.

3509
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:58,170
I think if you could talk somebody
into being a scientologist talk,

3510
01:32:58,180 --> 01:32:58,791
someone in devoting,

3511
01:32:58,791 --> 01:32:59,170
here's what,

3512
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:00,100
here's what I'll say to that.

3513
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:03,100
If you're that fucking stupid
shouldn't be without work.

3514
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:04,870
You probably didn't make it out to vote.

3515
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,640
I'd be willing to bet you
didn't make it out to vote,

3516
01:33:06,641 --> 01:33:07,810
but the problem is stupid.

3517
01:33:07,811 --> 01:33:09,370
People are often very motivated.

3518
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:10,061
It's mostly,

3519
01:33:10,061 --> 01:33:12,480
you see what the Westboro
Baptist church prays for it.

3520
01:33:12,490 --> 01:33:13,241
They're not stupid.

3521
01:33:13,241 --> 01:33:13,810
They're crazy.

3522
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:14,590
They're dumb.

3523
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:16,030
Then the ups guy was dumb.

3524
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:16,901
He was a lawyer.

3525
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:18,240
He was a civil rights attorney,

3526
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:19,330
but he was still an idiot.

3527
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:21,230
It was socially okay that,

3528
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:21,431
yeah,

3529
01:33:21,431 --> 01:33:24,220
but that's not the same as stupid
and like that's a different kind of,

3530
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,810
that's like a almost willful,

3531
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:27,190
I don't have to be stupid,

3532
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:27,910
but I am.

3533
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:28,061
Well,

3534
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:31,750
he's smart enough to memorize all the
shit that you needed to learn to become a

3535
01:33:31,751 --> 01:33:32,141
lawyer.

3536
01:33:32,141 --> 01:33:33,210
But as far as like,

3537
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:34,150
I love them too.

3538
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:34,421
First of all,

3539
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:35,770
he was a civil rights lawyer.

3540
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:37,870
He fought right when he got,

3541
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:40,300
he got major breakthroughs
for black people.

3542
01:33:40,301 --> 01:33:40,750
I look it up.

3543
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:42,160
He did something really nice.

3544
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,540
He Dude,

3545
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:44,770
the best part of this is,

3546
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:45,071
yeah,

3547
01:33:45,071 --> 01:33:45,461
it's weird.

3548
01:33:45,461 --> 01:33:47,020
They concentrate on this one rule,

3549
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:49,000
but they just saying what's in the Bible.

3550
01:33:49,001 --> 01:33:52,380
That's my favorite part because all
these people out there think no,

3551
01:33:52,450 --> 01:33:54,050
you can moderate the,

3552
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:55,780
you always say that moderate shit.

3553
01:33:55,781 --> 01:33:56,680
So I have news for you.

3554
01:33:56,681 --> 01:33:57,461
If you're a moderate,

3555
01:33:57,461 --> 01:33:57,760
they need,

3556
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:58,690
you're not in it.

3557
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,160
You full of Shit.

3558
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:01,060
Okay.

3559
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:04,270
That people that are really
doing it are the extreme ones.

3560
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:06,010
It's not a part time thing.

3561
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:10,030
So that's why I don't do it anymore
because I'm not going to half ass do it.

3562
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:14,140
So I like those people that because
literally the Bible says only a few people

3563
01:34:14,141 --> 01:34:15,040
are going to survive.

3564
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,870
That's why America is not Christian.

3565
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:17,771
If America,

3566
01:34:17,771 --> 01:34:18,730
we are all Christian,

3567
01:34:18,930 --> 01:34:20,770
that we wouldn't be
Christian automatically.

3568
01:34:20,771 --> 01:34:25,600
It's built in only a small few find the
Crampton narrow road leading to eternal

3569
01:34:25,601 --> 01:34:28,300
life and the road leading
to destruction is massive.

3570
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:29,680
And that's where most of the people go.

3571
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:32,820
So the though they think they're
those few that are on the cramp,

3572
01:34:32,821 --> 01:34:33,490
the road,

3573
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:34,860
much like a virgin butthole,

3574
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,410
she'd be so really the idea of a
Christian nation is impossible.

3575
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:39,190
Yeah.

3576
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:42,190
I don't know what Bible
people are reading your caves,

3577
01:34:42,191 --> 01:34:43,060
you dumb dumb book.

3578
01:34:43,061 --> 01:34:46,990
Do you not look at it and say the same
people that Tattoo Bible verses on your

3579
01:34:46,991 --> 01:34:47,291
body?

3580
01:34:47,291 --> 01:34:47,501
Like,

3581
01:34:47,501 --> 01:34:47,711
dude,

3582
01:34:47,711 --> 01:34:49,180
you got to read the whole book.

3583
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:49,570
I just said,

3584
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:50,403
I watched,

3585
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:53,290
I watched some redneck go,

3586
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:55,030
well you were not under that law anymore.

3587
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:56,860
I watch some redneck on some go.

3588
01:34:56,861 --> 01:34:57,320
Uh,

3589
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:57,651
yeah,

3590
01:34:57,651 --> 01:34:58,410
I was.

3591
01:34:58,410 --> 01:34:59,420
I'm Christian.

3592
01:34:59,421 --> 01:35:01,980
So I was raised to fight when
I forgot what I believe it.

3593
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,660
I say the exact opposite
of being Christian.

3594
01:35:05,661 --> 01:35:09,470
You fucking Dick head will
people pick and choose.

3595
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:12,020
They pick and choose
where they don't play.

3596
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:14,600
Certainly it's like divorce.

3597
01:35:14,601 --> 01:35:17,090
You're supposed to stone the
woman if you get divorced,

3598
01:35:17,091 --> 01:35:18,310
you know if the woman leaves here,

3599
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,580
that's it for adultery.

3600
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:23,390
There's a lot of terrible
fucking shit in there,

3601
01:35:23,391 --> 01:35:24,890
but that was a lot of it.

3602
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:29,480
You can absolutely justify with it was
for the time was somewhat progressive.

3603
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:30,763
Right?

3604
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:31,723
When you talk about,

3605
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:36,200
okay you can own slaves like well it
wasn't the kind of slavery we had at the

3606
01:35:36,201 --> 01:35:36,771
time.

3607
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:38,030
They were nicer about say like,

3608
01:35:38,031 --> 01:35:39,050
okay that's fine,

3609
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:40,550
but you're telling me that this,

3610
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:42,860
this book's exceptional so why aren't,

3611
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:44,150
why aren't they in the future?

3612
01:35:44,151 --> 01:35:45,410
Like if the word shoe,

3613
01:35:45,411 --> 01:35:47,550
God invented this shit itch,

3614
01:35:47,551 --> 01:35:48,290
you'd be like,

3615
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:50,270
oh way ahead of its time.

3616
01:35:50,271 --> 01:35:50,541
We're like,

3617
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:53,600
we're the ones that don't have slaves
cause we have the one true God.

3618
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:54,920
Why is it like that?

3619
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,800
Because I'm supposed to have them judging.

3620
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:59,780
I'm supposed to before I just do anything.

3621
01:35:59,781 --> 01:36:00,770
Imagine one of them,

3622
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,020
like one of the profits
is alive watching me.

3623
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,910
What would he would of Moses were here?

3624
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,590
What would he think of what I'm doing?

3625
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:07,640
I'm supposed to do that.

3626
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,473
And as a Christian,

3627
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:11,810
but I'm not supposed to judge
Moses for h Shinny Shit.

3628
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:12,793
Right?

3629
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:14,360
[inaudible] was a killer.

3630
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:14,771
I like,

3631
01:36:14,771 --> 01:36:15,060
yeah,

3632
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:16,190
I never killed anybody.

3633
01:36:16,191 --> 01:36:16,611
Moses.

3634
01:36:16,611 --> 01:36:17,770
And also I don't have slaves.

3635
01:36:17,771 --> 01:36:20,450
So you could save your
judgment of my fucking,

3636
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:21,290
you know,

3637
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:21,441
well,

3638
01:36:21,441 --> 01:36:22,730
just a few hundred years ago,

3639
01:36:22,731 --> 01:36:26,540
if you go back and read some of
this stuff that like Lincoln,

3640
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:29,540
we read this passage by
Linkedin the other day.

3641
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:29,751
Oh,

3642
01:36:29,751 --> 01:36:30,584
I love him.

3643
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:32,390
I love those passages there.

3644
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,150
They're crazy.

3645
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:35,690
I want them in the hall of
presidents at Disneyland.

3646
01:36:35,691 --> 01:36:36,970
I want Lincoln be like,

3647
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:37,471
Oh,

3648
01:36:37,471 --> 01:36:41,450
I'm not advocating or quality for
the Negro will all have a say.

3649
01:36:41,451 --> 01:36:42,440
Not wanting them to,

3650
01:36:42,441 --> 01:36:45,050
they shouldn't be allowed
to vote to hold office,

3651
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:45,591
uh,

3652
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:47,810
or be able to intermarry with whites.

3653
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,580
Like this was all like him in a debate.

3654
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:49,851
Yeah.

3655
01:36:49,851 --> 01:36:50,684
But that's his,

3656
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:53,370
that's his like compromising
to try to make it,

3657
01:36:53,371 --> 01:36:53,800
it's like,

3658
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:53,990
oh,

3659
01:36:53,990 --> 01:36:55,100
his Obamacare.

3660
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,040
It's not a perfect solution,

3661
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:59,390
but we had to do something.

3662
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,610
That's what that shit is probably,

3663
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:04,040
I guess back then as we were saying that,

3664
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:07,310
it was probably like super
radical progressive for the
time I was fighting with

3665
01:37:07,311 --> 01:37:08,090
Gavin.

3666
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:08,781
You Know Gavin,

3667
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:08,991
right?

3668
01:37:08,991 --> 01:37:09,741
Gavin McInnes.

3669
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:10,574
I know who he is,

3670
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:11,591
so we went to,

3671
01:37:11,591 --> 01:37:12,141
what are they talking about?

3672
01:37:12,141 --> 01:37:12,621
Slavery.

3673
01:37:12,621 --> 01:37:16,880
I live in fucking you guys going back
and slavery's not that bad or that the

3674
01:37:16,881 --> 01:37:19,250
civil wars and how bad slavery
there would be no civil war.

3675
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:20,300
If there had been no slavery,

3676
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:22,490
they wouldn't have gone to
war over cotton tariffs,

3677
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:22,911
tariffs.

3678
01:37:22,911 --> 01:37:23,840
They could've worked that out.

3679
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:25,580
Black Dick on the Lewis was,

3680
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:28,250
trust me a big fucking factor.

3681
01:37:28,251 --> 01:37:29,090
And if you took it out,

3682
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:29,750
no war.

3683
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:32,540
Absolutely so black Dick
on the loose you feel,

3684
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:33,231
of course.

3685
01:37:33,231 --> 01:37:34,010
Do you think they're going to like,

3686
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:36,800
you're going to free all these slaves we
haven't beaten and they're going to be

3687
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:39,510
just like us and you're
going to be fucking our kids.

3688
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:39,681
Well,

3689
01:37:39,681 --> 01:37:43,760
don't you think that the biggest fear
was that they would lose the economic

3690
01:37:43,761 --> 01:37:45,470
impact of having slaves?

3691
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:45,950
Well,

3692
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:46,920
that was the lowest.

3693
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:48,620
That's for,

3694
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:50,520
that's your rich man's
motive for [inaudible].

3695
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:53,870
You ever see like poor
man's road of his is like,

3696
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:56,130
oh now the blacks are coming from mine.

3697
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:58,440
That's my one thing I have that.

3698
01:37:58,441 --> 01:37:59,880
It's a very simple fucking thing.

3699
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:02,250
But they always get it
soft sell it like no,

3700
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:03,630
there was more to the conf wake.

3701
01:38:03,631 --> 01:38:04,590
Let's say there's no slavery.

3702
01:38:04,591 --> 01:38:05,970
The confederacy is still sucked,

3703
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:07,410
but he's still fucking traders.

3704
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:09,360
It's not like if you fucking,

3705
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:13,080
how are they traitors Prentice split
up the union over some bullshit.

3706
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:13,651
Right,

3707
01:38:13,651 --> 01:38:16,860
but why it should they give into the
fucking whims of the north and north of

3708
01:38:16,861 --> 01:38:16,981
there?

3709
01:38:16,981 --> 01:38:17,390
Fuck it.

3710
01:38:17,390 --> 01:38:18,210
Cities.

3711
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:19,740
That's what essentially was going on too.

3712
01:38:19,741 --> 01:38:21,600
That was a big part of what
was happening back then.

3713
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:23,130
There was two different lifestyles.

3714
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:23,911
The north,

3715
01:38:23,911 --> 01:38:25,230
which was about like cities,

3716
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:25,590
right?

3717
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:29,400
And there's a south that was like
agriculture and most when they were saying

3718
01:38:29,401 --> 01:38:29,940
like,

3719
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:31,170
oh it's about economics.

3720
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:32,620
Well yeah you,

3721
01:38:32,621 --> 01:38:35,740
you have a bunch of people
that are working for free
and they would like to aid

3722
01:38:35,790 --> 01:38:36,211
and you know,

3723
01:38:36,211 --> 01:38:37,320
they want to keep paying them.

3724
01:38:37,321 --> 01:38:39,330
Nothing that would have
just ended it on its own.

3725
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:39,900
Yeah.

3726
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,880
Eventually give up having free labor

3727
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,633
sill.

3728
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:45,780
Who said that about Brazil?

3729
01:38:45,781 --> 01:38:48,570
The Brazil did it without
killing 600 this fucking guy.

3730
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:48,871
I go,

3731
01:38:48,871 --> 01:38:49,470
listen,

3732
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:51,300
was Hiroshima necessary?

3733
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,580
Then the civil war was necessary.

3734
01:38:53,581 --> 01:38:53,971
Okay.

3735
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:56,010
If you're going to justify
dropping the atom bomb,

3736
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:56,880
which I do,

3737
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:57,690
then yeah,

3738
01:38:57,690 --> 01:38:59,340
600 if I'm asleep,

3739
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,600
if I'm ever a slave,

3740
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:02,330
by all means kill half a million southern.

3741
01:39:02,330 --> 01:39:02,531
There's,

3742
01:39:02,531 --> 01:39:03,330
until I'm free,

3743
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:04,163
by all means,

3744
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:07,320
I'm willing to sacrifice them
for me to not be a slave.

3745
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:08,663
So this guy,

3746
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:08,960
oh,

3747
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:09,450
it's like,

3748
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:09,601
oh,

3749
01:39:09,601 --> 01:39:11,670
it's all these shit that's
easy for you to say.

3750
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:12,990
If you're not a slave,

3751
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:14,670
that's where the bottom fucking line,

3752
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:17,400
and they just won't put
themselves in those shoes ever.

3753
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,800
It's gotta be like the ultimate showed up.

3754
01:39:19,801 --> 01:39:20,730
Black people.

3755
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:22,740
That's the whole fucking
point of that flag.

3756
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:23,800
We're being a care.

3757
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:24,633
If it bothers you,

3758
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:26,370
you'll never get that from us.

3759
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:28,440
It's a weird pride thing.

3760
01:39:28,441 --> 01:39:28,741
It's like,

3761
01:39:28,741 --> 01:39:30,300
what exactly are you proud of?

3762
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:32,370
You lost a war.

3763
01:39:32,371 --> 01:39:35,550
We were trying to separate from the
people that didn't want slavery.

3764
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:38,040
Is it you're proud of the
spot where you were born,

3765
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:40,950
which you had no control
over a young dude.

3766
01:39:40,951 --> 01:39:42,690
I don't want you to understand flags.

3767
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:43,141
You know,

3768
01:39:43,141 --> 01:39:46,690
I couldn't salute the flag when I was
growing up because I know that's going to

3769
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:48,690
fault them for neutral and all politics.

3770
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:49,670
If you're Joe was witness,

3771
01:39:49,671 --> 01:39:50,710
you don't get involved in politics.

3772
01:39:50,711 --> 01:39:51,630
So you don't vote at all?

3773
01:39:51,690 --> 01:39:52,470
No.

3774
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:53,160
Wow.

3775
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:53,451
Yeah.

3776
01:39:53,451 --> 01:39:53,680
It's,

3777
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:55,790
I don't give a shit what
Satan's system of things does.

3778
01:39:55,791 --> 01:39:57,300
Is it gonna be all wiped out.

3779
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:58,051
Oh,

3780
01:39:58,051 --> 01:39:58,470
I see.

3781
01:39:58,470 --> 01:39:58,951
But anyway,

3782
01:39:58,951 --> 01:39:59,551
so I never,

3783
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:01,320
I never got attached to a flag like that.

3784
01:40:01,321 --> 01:40:05,130
Like I never understood because I got
to be ever felt that feeling of like a

3785
01:40:05,131 --> 01:40:05,964
flag,

3786
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,320
even though now I'm like,

3787
01:40:07,321 --> 01:40:08,760
I'm way into America,

3788
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:09,320
but I,

3789
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:12,030
I couldn't ever like just be into a flat.

3790
01:40:12,031 --> 01:40:14,040
It's so something so gross about that.

3791
01:40:14,070 --> 01:40:15,660
Well it is kinda gross and it's,

3792
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:19,740
it's gross just by way of all all
definitions that are like confining.

3793
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:21,490
Like if you can find yourself like,

3794
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:21,641
no,

3795
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:22,411
I'm American.

3796
01:40:22,411 --> 01:40:24,690
It's fucking Mexicans trying
to come over here to our land.

3797
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:25,950
Imagine if you were saying,

3798
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:26,761
hey man,

3799
01:40:26,761 --> 01:40:30,060
I'm from California and those fuckers
from Nevada trying to come over to

3800
01:40:30,061 --> 01:40:30,631
California,

3801
01:40:30,631 --> 01:40:31,464
we're going to kill him.

3802
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:31,801
No,

3803
01:40:31,801 --> 01:40:34,220
you go over to Nevada and
there's just other Americans.

3804
01:40:34,221 --> 01:40:34,441
So like,

3805
01:40:34,441 --> 01:40:34,651
hey,

3806
01:40:34,651 --> 01:40:35,310
how you doing?

3807
01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:36,143
But if you go right,

3808
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:36,511
right,

3809
01:40:36,511 --> 01:40:37,530
instead of left,

3810
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:40,920
all of a sudden you're in a place where
people all look exactly the fucking

3811
01:40:40,921 --> 01:40:41,380
same.

3812
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:41,580
Yes.

3813
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:44,870
He's not going to do a ton of
Mexicans in Nevada and they're like,

3814
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:44,940
hey,

3815
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:45,510
what's up brother?

3816
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:46,200
What are you doing man?

3817
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:46,621
What's going on?

3818
01:40:46,621 --> 01:40:47,161
Everything's cool.

3819
01:40:47,161 --> 01:40:47,671
Everything's normal.

3820
01:40:47,671 --> 01:40:49,590
You're talking to them
like they're your friends.

3821
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:50,730
They're fellow Americans.

3822
01:40:50,731 --> 01:40:51,061
But that,

3823
01:40:51,061 --> 01:40:51,300
yeah,

3824
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:51,931
go right.

3825
01:40:51,931 --> 01:40:52,711
And then the,

3826
01:40:52,711 --> 01:40:53,531
they're the what?

3827
01:40:53,531 --> 01:40:54,131
The enemy.

3828
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:54,530
What are they?

3829
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:56,890
Are they an ally or they
can't come over here.

3830
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:57,350
Well,

3831
01:40:57,350 --> 01:41:00,970
people don't seem to realize that
whatever immigrants it is like,

3832
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:04,960
it's not like if they learn English
that if their kids learn English or

3833
01:41:04,961 --> 01:41:05,350
something,

3834
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:06,030
you know what I mean?

3835
01:41:06,030 --> 01:41:07,270
[inaudible] generation.

3836
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:08,050
Ron.

3837
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:08,321
Yeah.

3838
01:41:08,321 --> 01:41:08,741
But she,

3839
01:41:08,741 --> 01:41:09,071
you know,

3840
01:41:09,071 --> 01:41:11,320
I was surprised because
she fest cause I go,

3841
01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:15,580
my whole thing is can you just go to
wherever who is hiring illegals and go and

3842
01:41:15,581 --> 01:41:19,990
see everyone's paperwork and then penalize
the company for doing that and then

3843
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:20,620
problem solve.

3844
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:21,640
There's no more jobs for them.

3845
01:41:21,641 --> 01:41:22,331
And she's like,

3846
01:41:22,331 --> 01:41:22,481
yeah,

3847
01:41:22,481 --> 01:41:26,080
no the corporations or the one
of the biggest promoters of it.

3848
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:27,101
But so,

3849
01:41:27,101 --> 01:41:28,510
so bill Maher made a good point.

3850
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:28,751
He was like,

3851
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:32,620
you should have called the book that how
corporations are fucking it up because

3852
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:35,830
people are just going to dismiss your
points now cause you just blamed it on the

3853
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:36,781
white blame the IMEC.

3854
01:41:36,781 --> 01:41:39,490
Why would I not come here and try
and get a job if I needed one?

3855
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:40,240
Why would I not?

3856
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:42,370
That's just a radical
hot button topic though.

3857
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,780
Blaming it on immigrants.

3858
01:41:43,781 --> 01:41:46,870
Like people love doing that because
I think to get people on your side,

3859
01:41:46,871 --> 01:41:48,460
if there's like a few key components,

3860
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:50,080
you're not going to touch my guns.

3861
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:50,621
You know,

3862
01:41:50,621 --> 01:41:53,910
fucking immigration has ruined
this country's foreign country.

3863
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:54,671
We go to worry about,

3864
01:41:54,671 --> 01:41:55,610
oh we got porous.

3865
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:57,220
But it's such an eternal argument,

3866
01:41:57,221 --> 01:41:57,460
man.

3867
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:58,900
It sounds so bill the butcher,

3868
01:41:59,170 --> 01:42:00,340
when they throw in potatoes,

3869
01:42:00,341 --> 01:42:01,630
that Irish people coming off the boat,

3870
01:42:01,631 --> 01:42:02,200
you know,

3871
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,250
it sounds just like that.

3872
01:42:03,251 --> 01:42:04,780
Like you just sound like the same shit.

3873
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:07,650
People all want the same
shit they want to have.

3874
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:11,290
Like they'll fucking middleclass home
and all that and you can see it every

3875
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:14,590
fucking race that comes here
that that gets to that level.

3876
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:18,460
They kind of just live like TV
sitcoms people because I mean,

3877
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:19,210
exactly.

3878
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:19,961
That's what most people,

3879
01:42:19,961 --> 01:42:23,290
there's only a few of them where they
try to fucking set themselves apart and

3880
01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:24,880
they're mostly white cuckoo religions.

3881
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:26,343
Yeah.

3882
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:27,363
Yeah.

3883
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:28,610
It's,

3884
01:42:28,610 --> 01:42:33,400
it's real hard when you try to
see like how robot Dick Again,

3885
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,840
I think it's distracting as fuck.

3886
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:35,290
Oh yeah.

3887
01:42:35,290 --> 01:42:36,280
I like how you lean back.

3888
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:36,820
I said,

3889
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:38,380
well I can still hear it though.

3890
01:42:38,381 --> 01:42:39,214
And your ears.

3891
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,083
You must know.

3892
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:40,930
Oh,

3893
01:42:40,930 --> 01:42:42,700
soothing me Jerry.

3894
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:43,563
Try the gum.

3895
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:45,000
The Gum.

3896
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,090
I was just like getting bigger,

3897
01:42:46,091 --> 01:42:48,280
darker objects to put into my mouth.

3898
01:42:48,281 --> 01:42:48,451
Dude.

3899
01:42:48,451 --> 01:42:50,260
They gave us one that was so stupid.

3900
01:42:50,261 --> 01:42:51,730
We still have that
stupid thing around here.

3901
01:42:51,731 --> 01:42:52,091
Jamie.

3902
01:42:52,091 --> 01:42:52,920
He's in the back,

3903
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,010
the back there.

3904
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:54,551
They give me,

3905
01:42:54,551 --> 01:42:54,760
uh,

3906
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:55,600
you've seen that one?

3907
01:42:55,601 --> 01:42:55,841
That yeah,

3908
01:42:55,841 --> 01:42:56,920
it looks like a light saber.

3909
01:42:56,980 --> 01:42:57,850
It looks retarded.

3910
01:42:57,851 --> 01:42:58,331
It literally,

3911
01:42:58,331 --> 01:43:00,040
it literally looks like a weapon.

3912
01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:00,341
I know.

3913
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:02,500
They construct it in
themselves like lightsabers.

3914
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,720
It was huge.

3915
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:05,351
It was huge.

3916
01:43:05,351 --> 01:43:05,780
And it was,

3917
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:06,970
you had to refill it though.

3918
01:43:06,971 --> 01:43:09,310
Every like 10 hits or something.

3919
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:11,160
Do that.

3920
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:13,120
The squirt into the cotton and everything.

3921
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:14,010
What are you doing?

3922
01:43:14,010 --> 01:43:14,910
I didn't use cotton.

3923
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:15,551
It's a mess.

3924
01:43:15,551 --> 01:43:16,181
Every time I do it,

3925
01:43:16,181 --> 01:43:19,810
I need some tissues so I got to an eye
dropper is shit now the battery ran out

3926
01:43:19,811 --> 01:43:21,310
so I got a spare battery in his car.

3927
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:22,180
Oh my God.

3928
01:43:22,181 --> 01:43:23,014
You're a junkie.

3929
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:23,770
Yeah,

3930
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:24,291
but it's,

3931
01:43:24,291 --> 01:43:25,570
it's not like killing me.

3932
01:43:25,571 --> 01:43:26,380
How cigarettes are killing,

3933
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:27,640
I mean seconds be killing me man.

3934
01:43:27,641 --> 01:43:28,390
I could feel it.

3935
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:29,223
It was horrible.

3936
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:31,150
You could feel it like
eating away at your health.

3937
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:32,170
Oh yeah.

3938
01:43:32,171 --> 01:43:33,610
So I don't feel like that no more.

3939
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:33,881
Brian,

3940
01:43:33,881 --> 01:43:34,900
how long have you been off now?

3941
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,110
For three weeks.

3942
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:38,981
I'm proud of you,

3943
01:43:38,981 --> 01:43:39,520
dude.

3944
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,630
That's really strong.

3945
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:41,590
That's very strong.

3946
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,030
I'm glad you made it that far,

3947
01:43:43,031 --> 01:43:43,480
man.

3948
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:44,111
Just keep going.

3949
01:43:44,111 --> 01:43:45,130
You think you're free now?

3950
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:46,180
Yeah,

3951
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:47,013
I'm just bored.

3952
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:47,411
Yeah,

3953
01:43:47,411 --> 01:43:50,320
but do you think you're free where
you'll stop smoking for now on?

3954
01:43:50,370 --> 01:43:50,760
Yeah,

3955
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:51,380
it seems get it.

3956
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,010
I really hope so.

3957
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,311
I'll do it.

3958
01:43:52,311 --> 01:43:52,731
I used to,

3959
01:43:52,731 --> 01:43:53,780
I really worried about you.

3960
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:54,231
I was like,

3961
01:43:54,231 --> 01:43:56,750
I'm going to get the call one day from
that guy and he's going to say I have

3962
01:43:56,751 --> 01:43:57,480
cancer and I'm,

3963
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:58,160
I'm like,

3964
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:58,993
I can't even tell you.

3965
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,790
I tried to get you to
quit for 10 fucking years.

3966
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:03,230
It was up to two packs.

3967
01:44:03,231 --> 01:44:04,064
Awesome

3968
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:06,830
dude.

3969
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:08,150
It's the guy who the store,

3970
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:10,370
everybody smokes there
and they're all just,

3971
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:12,170
when I saw companies,

3972
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:12,920
when I started smoking,

3973
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:13,580
yeah,

3974
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:14,780
the store is a real bad.

3975
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:17,840
It's better than the Improv is not
as bad as far as like mountain.

3976
01:44:17,841 --> 01:44:20,120
The laugh factory is not bad at all
because there's nowhere to smoke.

3977
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:22,430
If the fact that the
comedy store has a patio,

3978
01:44:22,431 --> 01:44:25,370
you could smoke it so like you're sitting
there and people were just blowing

3979
01:44:25,371 --> 01:44:26,181
smoke in your face.

3980
01:44:26,181 --> 01:44:27,014
Non Style.

3981
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:28,130
That's an interesting thing.

3982
01:44:28,131 --> 01:44:29,750
I've never thought about
what the laugh factor.

3983
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:31,010
The factor doesn't have anything.

3984
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,780
They don't have a place
where you can go with that.

3985
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:36,980
Improv kind of has like that parking
lot type parking lot is great.

3986
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:38,390
I'm out there all the time.

3987
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,370
No,

3988
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:40,671
no.

3989
01:44:40,671 --> 01:44:42,050
I'm off until Thursday.

3990
01:44:42,051 --> 01:44:43,250
I'm doing a store Thursday,

3991
01:44:43,251 --> 01:44:44,180
Friday and Saturday.

3992
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:44,901
Oh,

3993
01:44:44,901 --> 01:44:45,141
okay.

3994
01:44:45,141 --> 01:44:46,490
Let me show you around you motherfucker.

3995
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:47,121
I know.

3996
01:44:47,121 --> 01:44:48,620
I want to see do some standup in town.

3997
01:44:48,621 --> 01:44:50,360
I haven't seen you since Montreal.

3998
01:44:50,770 --> 01:44:52,250
We were at that little tiny club.

3999
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:53,150
The comedy works.

4000
01:44:53,530 --> 01:44:55,440
He's an ex Jehovah's witness to the older,

4001
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:57,013
yeah,

4002
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:58,670
the Highlander.

4003
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:02,810
But he's not a business that closes going,

4004
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:03,720
but why did it go under?

4005
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,140
I don't know cause I used to
love going and hanging out there,

4006
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:07,183
man.

4007
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:08,330
I ain't no dude.

4008
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:09,580
That was a great call.

4009
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:09,751
Oh,

4010
01:45:09,751 --> 01:45:11,510
can I get a lot of listeners right?

4011
01:45:11,511 --> 01:45:11,830
Yeah.

4012
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:16,830
Cause stress factory in New Brunswick
on July 23rd through 25th excellent.

4013
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:17,970
If you're out there,

4014
01:45:17,970 --> 01:45:19,340
come see me at the stress factory.

4015
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:20,120
Beautiful.

4016
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:20,750
Do that.

4017
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:20,961
Yeah,

4018
01:45:20,961 --> 01:45:21,621
he's hilarious.

4019
01:45:21,621 --> 01:45:22,760
If you haven't seen Kurt Metzger,

4020
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:23,870
plug your ears so I can talk.

4021
01:45:23,871 --> 01:45:24,704
Nice about you.

4022
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:26,121
Very,

4023
01:45:26,121 --> 01:45:26,954
very funny guy.

4024
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:29,210
That's why I really wanted to
see you while you were in town.

4025
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:29,651
Yeah,

4026
01:45:29,651 --> 01:45:29,840
man,

4027
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,250
I've been wanting to come on for awhile.

4028
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:32,143
Fucker.

4029
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:33,800
How often he around here?

4030
01:45:34,430 --> 01:45:34,851
Uh,

4031
01:45:34,851 --> 01:45:36,110
it depends on what work I have.

4032
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:40,910
I had a press junket to do
and your podcast is on iTunes.

4033
01:45:40,911 --> 01:45:41,930
People can get it on everything.

4034
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:42,500
Cloud.

4035
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:42,981
Itunes.

4036
01:45:42,981 --> 01:45:43,131
Yeah.

4037
01:45:43,131 --> 01:45:45,500
It's called race wars
with Kurt and Charlotte.

4038
01:45:45,501 --> 01:45:46,490
I'm going to subscribe right now.

4039
01:45:46,491 --> 01:45:47,840
I heard great things about the hertz.

4040
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:49,650
Really funny stuff is still came out.

4041
01:45:49,651 --> 01:45:50,810
It was one of our better ones,

4042
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:55,220
but sometimes it's the people talking
over each other and show that happens.

4043
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:55,850
Well,

4044
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:57,380
it's not as easy as it looks.

4045
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:58,190
I agree with you.

4046
01:45:58,190 --> 01:45:59,840
You know what I saw the other day?

4047
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:03,290
Somebody put up a video of a dead mouse.

4048
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:04,191
Eddie Bravo,

4049
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:05,180
Russell Peters,

4050
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:07,700
me and you doing a podcast.

4051
01:46:07,701 --> 01:46:08,900
Remember that podcast that we did?

4052
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:10,790
All the talking over each other.

4053
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:12,950
We were all hammered so bad.

4054
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:14,540
It's so hard to listen to fucking,

4055
01:46:14,541 --> 01:46:15,050
yeah,

4056
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:16,040
so hard to listen to.

4057
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:16,581
Yeah.

4058
01:46:16,581 --> 01:46:18,680
That happens a lot with
the ice house chronicles.

4059
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:20,490
It's one of the most annoying thing.

4060
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:20,970
Did you see?

4061
01:46:20,970 --> 01:46:21,860
We've had as many,

4062
01:46:21,861 --> 01:46:24,140
like seven or eight people and
I'm like [inaudible] before.

4063
01:46:24,830 --> 01:46:27,110
Did you see the Paris
Hilton I prank video?

4064
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,130
No,

4065
01:46:28,130 --> 01:46:29,210
they got to go though.

4066
01:46:29,690 --> 01:46:30,350
I have to go.

4067
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:32,330
Unfortunately I have
to leave Paris Hilton.

4068
01:46:32,510 --> 01:46:33,590
There's Egyptian guy,

4069
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,770
a prankster where they're in an airplane
and they made the airplane like,

4070
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,900
like nose dive and stuff like that.

4071
01:46:38,901 --> 01:46:39,531
And now she's like,

4072
01:46:39,531 --> 01:46:39,890
she's like,

4073
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:44,650
I fly all the time and now I'm scared
to be on a plane going to swamp.

4074
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:45,440
She's uh,

4075
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,610
she's allowed to sue I guess.

4076
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,000
Unfortunately I have to
end this thing early.

4077
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:51,331
I got,

4078
01:46:51,331 --> 01:46:51,930
oh,

4079
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:54,390
I got an obligation but a Kurt Metzger.

4080
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:55,400
Thank you very much for coming in.

4081
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:58,880
We're going to be on Sirius to I come on.

4082
01:46:58,900 --> 01:46:59,371
How do we do it?

4083
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:00,760
We Skype or uh,

4084
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:01,230
yeah.

4085
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:01,650
What do you want?

4086
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:03,270
Anytime you want to do that we can what?

4087
01:47:03,271 --> 01:47:05,160
I'll see you out here.

4088
01:47:05,161 --> 01:47:06,150
Do you do it live out here?

4089
01:47:06,151 --> 01:47:06,530
Over,

4090
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:06,830
I mean,

4091
01:47:06,830 --> 01:47:07,170

4092
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:07,740
we got it.

4093
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:09,090
I want to do a tour with him.

4094
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:09,500
Yeah,

4095
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:09,760
