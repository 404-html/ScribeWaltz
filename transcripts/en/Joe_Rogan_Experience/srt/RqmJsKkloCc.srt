5
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:27,540

If you are in your car like a lot of
people listen to podcasts that way.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you're in your car if you're commuting
it makes being on a plane or a train

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,000
whatever makes it more interesting than
just fucking sitting in traffic and

13
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:54,834
being retarded.

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,690
This will make it so that you're actually
enjoying that time you'll actually be

15
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:05,190
entertained. The amount of
titles. It's impossible to put

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,810
a value to it.

17
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,160
In my opinion I mean one hundred fifty
thousand titles is this is incredible.

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,890
I love audible I'm a huge huge fan of it.

19
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,670
I'll give you a recommendation if
your creative title type at all.

20
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,320
Get the War of Art by Stephen press
field a friend of the podcast has been on

21
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:24,390
before I was a huge fan of his.

22
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,260
Long before he ever did the podcast I
use to hand out the books the audio book

23
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:31,680
is actually even better very
inspirational Very interesting stuff.

incredible application called
whisper sync and what it

28
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:59,490
does is if you're listening to an Audible
book and you're reading a book at the

29
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:01,050
same time they sync up together.

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,600
So if you're reading the book at home and

if you never been there before on it is

36
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,220
a human optimisation Web site.

37
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,810
What we sell is the best shit that
we can find as far as strength and

38
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,500
conditioning equipment.

39
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,670
As far as nutrients as far as protein
powder and supplements of course we have

40
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,070
the primal kettle bells that the ape
kettle bells and the zombie kettle bells

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,240
which are new ones that we have
made. Why. Because why not.

42
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,350
You supposed to be inspired when you
working out no better way to be inspired

43
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,890
than to stare at a big fucking 70
pound gorilla head. It's frightening.

44
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,960
It's exciting and it's good for you
if you want strength in conditioning

45
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:58,590
equipment.

46
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,500
If you want to get fit and strong and
you want what they call functional

47
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:04,350
strength there's no better
way than than kettle bells.

48
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,150
I'm a huge fan and supporter of them I
work out with them every week and you

49
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:13,640

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,833

So go there meat eater dot VH X dot
com and go to the meat eater dot com.

77
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,290
Steven now is here. Let's not fuck around
any further. Cue the music. Young Jamie.

78
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,080
The Joe Rogan Experience. To. Get.

79
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,200
Some pigs are gonna die this
weekend Steve. No that's right.

80
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm I'm 90 shots in my shoulders made
out of fucking hamburger right now from

81
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:20,920
all the impacts unless someone think
we're talking about police with time bomb

82
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,680
suits scruff.

83
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,180
Yeah I thought about posting a photo of
the targets that I shot and some pigs

84
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,960
are going to die but I didn't
think that that would be.

85
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,060
No that could be problematic.
Sue Sue. I'm glad you're here.

86
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,690
This the the Eurasian wild boar.
You know it's interesting man

87
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,103
all.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
All pigs in North America so domestic
the kind you and your bacon feral ones

89
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,440
wild ones it's all one species.

90
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,200
Yeah you told me that much is
there's differences. They react.

91
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,760
They recognize them all as one species.

92
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,540
There's some old world like there in
Africa there's some other members of the

93
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:03,510
pig family and have a leaner and not have
leaner Pachauri so like many here have.

94
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,120
People talk about pigs in Arizona
they're often talking about a pack.

95
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,300
But yeah all the pigs so Charlotte models
the spider Wilbur from Wilbur to hog

96
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:18,130
Zilla is soooo scruffy.

97
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,920
That's so strange. I didn't know that
until you told me when we're in Wisconsin.

98
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,100
It doesn't seem right but there's always
varieties you know it's like what.

99
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,140
You know that but all that they
roll all the dogs under Romney.

100
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,290
You think that pigs look.

101
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,570
You think that Wilbur Ariel like you
know like a like a classic though they

102
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,490
don't really exist.
The is like pink hairless farm pig.

103
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,960
I mean he doesn't look as different from
what we'd call a Russian boar which is

104
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:46,620
a variety. He doesn't look as different
as a Chihuahua does from a mastiff.

105
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,740
Yeah but they would discuss those as
being what Qantas domestic Qantas domestic

106
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,440
what is of the common dog.

107
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,800
What's weird about the common dog is
that they all emanate from wolves.

108
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,170
All of them now.
That's so strange.

109
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,350
That's while you take a wolf and turn
into an English bulldog like How the fuck

110
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:07,420
did that.

111
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,360
But I don't know those boys
and you you might read this.

112
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,320
Those boys in Russia that were taken
silver foxes and just like selecting for

113
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:20,310
behavior and stuff they could move
those things so fast. Really. Move.

114
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,340
Move the trait to me.
Yeah. They're just. Yeah.

115
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,960
I came home the details and if I did tie
the details you'd look it up and then

116
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:28,260
call me in time world's wrong.

117
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,820
But somehow I don't I learned
not to get too detailed.

118
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,480
But they could move dogs really fast.

119
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,890
Selecting four color behavioral
characteristics was amazing.

120
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,670
Just a few generations you know.
Wow. They're very malleable.

121
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,710
I've always wondered how.

122
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,780
I mean I think it's a massive mystery
isn't it how dogs were initially created

123
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,560
of wolves.

124
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,870
I mean you hear so many so
much contradictory stuff.

125
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,920
I got a point in time I guess I've always
kind of followed this a little bit and

126
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,520
I've written about I learned a lot
about dogs. I mentioned this to other.

127
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,090
I wrote a piece about eating dogs in
Vietnam and so I had this kind of little

128
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,110
summation in this article
about the history of dogs
and it went through the fact

129
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:14,750
checking process at outside magazine
which is very rigorous like if you say my

130
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,030
mom is my mom they'll call your mom.

131
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,030
And make sure it's your mom in

132
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,530
I had all these things that I kind of
like assumed were just true you know and

133
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,260
this fact checkers like
that's in fact not true.

134
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,340
So I had to relearn my understanding of
dogs at the time they were saying oh you

135
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:36,341
know it seems that dogs originated in
China and you know like the oldest trace

136
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:37,820
of dogs is there.

137
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,320
Since then I feel like I've read that
you know they definitely the first

138
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,950
Americans deftly brought we're traveling
with dogs brought them down in the New

139
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:46,670
World.

140
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,170
But here there seems to have been some
intro aggression from the Grey Wolf.

141
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,350
So they picked up some
other characteristics move
things along the way even

142
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:58,070
though the guys that came through the
Bering Land Bridge were not pack and with

143
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:02,180
them a dog that looked Wolf like their
prey pack and with them a dog it was

144
00:09:02,181 --> 00:09:05,270
decidedly domestic dog like wow.

145
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,080
So they had already gone already gone
through some you know who had already gone

146
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,630
through some transformations they were
just traveling Wolf dogs they were

147
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:16,631
traveling with a dog that had been under
selective pressure for you know fifteen

148
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,000
years.

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,440
I mean because I remember one time saying
all the domestic dogs seems to go back

150
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,280
30000 years the domestic dogs need to go
back thousand years but people arrived

151
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:31,180
here you know is debated but some time
between maybe 15 20 thousand years ago

152
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,670
and when they showed up they
had a dog that was not a wolf.

153
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,480
But but then there was intra
aggression from wolves.

154
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,940
But this seems to be like a really hot
topic and people are always digging into

155
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:43,360
this because genetics is
changing everything we
understand like things that we

156
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:48,120
used to think were related are not related
things we think we're not related are

157
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,060
in fact related.

158
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,830
You know we talk that I like
the whole media thing like that.

159
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,910
MUELLER seemed to be a very new species.
You know since the Pleistocene really.

160
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,820
Yeah. It is not. They
have been around long.

161
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,160
It was like a hybridization event between
black tailed deer and white tailed do

162
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:07,180
you created the media.

163
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:12,130
It's like our newest big game species and
it's probably will be one that doesn't

164
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:12,700
last long.

165
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,300
You know it'll be like in the long term
you might look at mule deer and see them

166
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:19,040
as this this blip really just like.

167
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,040
I mean they're so susceptible to
being out competed the very habitat

168
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,260
fragmentation is hard on them
and they have been here long.

169
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,320
I mean other hand whitetail deer
been here millions of years.

170
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,760
They're like they thrive.

171
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,400
They're super adaptable they
can eat anything live anywhere.

172
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,690
They're amazingly

173
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,700
capable of surviving on this continent
and mule deer like this new thing.

174
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,890
It's a bar like my favorite animal.
I like the sun.

175
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,840
You know the sun's going to last for a
billion more years it's going to burn out.

176
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,710
But I think I like this.

177
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,710
I like them you'll hear a lot to this
and it seems like I mean despite a lot of

178
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:56,290
people's best efforts to prevent it
from happening it seems like Mehldau are

179
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,483
vulnerable.

180
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,760
It seems like they're slowly
starting to die off too.

181
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,940
There was an article about the numbers
dropping in their habitat dropping and

182
00:11:03,941 --> 00:11:04,850
being diminished.

183
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,900
They're being pushed down then.
Some things are hard to explain you know.

184
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,060
But white tails they've always lived in
the southeast and white tails seem to

185
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:18,061
periodically expand out again for climatic
reasons retract but they kind of keep

186
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,650
that like ancestral homeland.

187
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,520
I'm talking very long term ancestral
homeland the southeast but once I'm white

188
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:29,090
cells made it all across the country and
some climatic conditions or something

189
00:11:29,091 --> 00:11:32,390
happen in the population retracted
but it left this remnant population in

190
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:37,391
California on the car on the Pacific
coast and then there was a massive genetic

191
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:38,890
barrier.

192
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,720
You know like if you took a bunch of
dogs and separate them and put you know

193
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,900
some dogs in South America and some dogs
North American came back and checked on

194
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:49,360
them in a long time they're going to
have gone in a little different direction

195
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,570
and that became the black tail.

196
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,080
And then at the time the black tail seems
to have extended its range eastward.

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,090
The white tailed deer extended its
range back westward and there was a

198
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:06,091
hybridization event where male black tails
were breeding with female white tails

199
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,390
and producing like this hybrid mule deer
there's a habitat retraction again in

200
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,660
black tails retracted back to the coast
and white tails retract back the other

201
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:20,920
way and you had this that spawned this
thing we call me older how do they follow

202
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:21,180
that.

203
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,700
Like how do they know there was all this
guy various guys who's like the most

204
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:29,290
interesting biologist he's a guy out
of Calgary and various guys has kind of

205
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,530
like done so much work on big game.
He's got like the mule.

206
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,550
He's like people like oh he's the military
guy. He's dealt guys the buffalo guy.

207
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,490
He came up a lot of interesting theories
like solving some stuff we talked about

208
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:43,700
the past where various guys came up with
the idea that what happens is species

209
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:46,730
when they colonize land had
been vacated by glaciers.

210
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,110
You know there's certain things that go
on and you got into founder effect you

211
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:56,111
know where imagine like one way we got
different as people is imagine that just

212
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:59,060
like for people

213
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,200
struck off across the oceans in a homemade
craft and landed there and you had a

214
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:12,531
male and a female in a spawn a new you
know they successfully breeding cranium

215
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,720
population.

216
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Let's say they both just happened to
be six seven You know in three hundred

217
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:24,040
pounds you had like this thing like
the founder effect where a small little

218
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,510
population can carry traits and
characteristics that are maybe not totally

219
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,940
not a complete example of where they
came from and so you have like a radical

220
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:37,190
deviation when they spread out.

221
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,370
Wow. So he got into this
stuff with animals and in
water animals seemed to change

222
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,330
like when the bison
arrived in North America.

223
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,750
Why did it also have a 6 foot horn
span and then shrank very rapidly.

224
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,600
So he got into a lot of these ideas and
he also did a lot of genetic work you

225
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:55,310
know like mitochondrial DNA.

226
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,950
So they can track female descent
you should have in mind sometime.

227
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,740
Yeah.

228
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,620
You know he'd be the coolest guy to
have on the world actually various guys.

229
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,550
Yeah. Where do you live.
Could I come listen. Yeah.

230
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,300
Just listen at home with most people
right. We could just come in you come in.

231
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,530
I'm sure you'd have questions yeah. You
could just sit there and drink coffee. OK.

232
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,580
And I'll come and I'll be like.
Sounds perfect.

233
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,930
I no explain this to me Mr.
Guy is that he's a great guy.

234
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:26,010
So he was he got in a lot of stuff with
the deer and I bring all this up because

235
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:29,660
we're looking at your fine specimen you're
fine four by four mules sitting here

236
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,390
and would've never happened
if it wasn't for you.

237
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,003
Boom boom.

238
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,380
I was watching this thing there was
talking about deer on television they were

239
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:41,800
talking about the difference in the
size of the bodies of deer from the far

240
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:45,850
north like Alberta in Canada to
the far south. Like in Mexico.

241
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,320
And the further you go south.

242
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,550
The animals tend to be smaller
they tend to be smaller bodied.

243
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,550
Yeah it's the prints maybe got Mickey.
It's the print.

244
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,780
Alan Burt is the burger principle.

245
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,800
It's got a name tag there's a name for
that principle and it would be that if

246
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,260
you'd like to take the extreme like
white tail like the biggest guys dream of

247
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:10,440
going to Alberta to hunt white tails
because White tells a huge meal out 100

248
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,880
pounds right there a nugget big
know that's crazy that's an elk.

249
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,240
I mean 400 is huge but you know you get
deer it pushed up and you go down the

250
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:21,980
Florida Keys. That's a white tail.
Those things are 70 80 pounds.

251
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,610
So there's this principle the burger
Bergman It's got a name my brother he told

252
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:31,820
me the name what is and what some
species seem to be a little bit exempt.

253
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,960
They say that mule you don't do that
quite as much you know you get some really

254
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:38,630
big meal and other areas they're not
they're not as tied to but just like a

255
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:43,340
general principle what do they speculate
has to do with is heat retention.

256
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,263
So

257
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,830
you have more like you weigh more than me

258
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,253
I have

259
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,480
more surface area per unit of mass than
you have so if you're really big deer if

260
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:06,300
you're in the north the thing you're
trying to do is retain body heat in the

261
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:10,110
animals like people shed body heat by
just exposing parts like when deer lay

262
00:16:10,111 --> 00:16:12,510
down they lay down with their legs talk
to them because look on the inside of

263
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:16,800
deer's leg. Very thin hair
very thin hair under the tail.

264
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,660
Right now we're laying down to protect.

265
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,120
If it's cold they're protecting
those areas that have thin hair.

266
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,620
So a big animal has less surface area.

267
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,730
So he's he's less capable of shedding
heat and more capable of retaining heat.

268
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:35,400
A small wiry animal has greater
service there. He's able to shed heat.

269
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,460
So one of the things you look at Mueller
like Mehldau further south will have

270
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,610
tend to have bigger ears because a very
a great way to shed heat is through your

271
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:51,570
ears will have thinner hair on their
ears bigger years if you think what a

272
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:54,700
radical version of it is
imagine like the woolly mammoth.

273
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,800
OK Roy Mann with the woolly mammoth
is more closely related to the African

274
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:02,340
elephant than he is to the mastodon.

275
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,990
So you had North America at the tail end
of the Pleistocene he had mammoths and

276
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:09,810
mastodons and mammoths were not
very close related to mastodons.

277
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,080
They're pretty close were they to African
elephants mammoths live in the north.

278
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,510
They have essentially no ear.
They have a very small here.

279
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,170
You look at African elephants had those
giant friggin ears because they can

280
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,800
funnel a lot of blood through
those ears and shed a lot of heat.

281
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,460
It's like you shed a lot of heat through
your fingers you know in your ears how

282
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:30,060
they get so cold so fast because you're
able to you know you push a lot of blood

283
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:32,570
into those areas and it's
cooling off in the air.

284
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,300
So that's one reason that that's
like a theory of if it is.

285
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,180
I think it might be the Bergman principle
Bergman's Bergman's rule that's where

286
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,640
Bergman's rule would has
one explanation for it.

287
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,400
I don't know if you'd ever really know
the absolute truth an explanation for its

288
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,870
heat retention heat dissipation.

289
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,400
That's fascinating so the stuff that's
on the northern extreme of its range

290
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:57,120
where it's boarding up against like the
thing that that puts the throttle on its

291
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:59,370
existence is cold.

292
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,280
He will tend to get bigger in mammals.

293
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,070
You know he'll tend to get bigger but
then there's all these other deviations

294
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:08,920
like why do you know how you get these
huge reptiles on islands you know. Yeah.

295
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,300
And then on islands you tend to have
dwarfing like that Rangel island off

296
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:15,600
Siberia had these little
mini mammoths you know. Yeah.

297
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,450
So there's all these other factors like
I don't you know I don't know why it's

298
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:22,570
like that with islands but not
with latitude. Do you get that.

299
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,160
And I've also I think I've read from maybe
as various guys was writing about how

300
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Mehldau seemed to not be quite as they
seem to defy Bergman's rule a little bit

301
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:36,850
more than some other species do
prob because they're a hybrid.

302
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,840
I've no idea. That's fascinating.
The island dwarfism is a weird thing.

303
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,070
It's bizarre how it
doesn't apply to lizards.

304
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,330
Yeah they get you know like yeah I guess
those things get huge and these get

305
00:18:46,331 --> 00:18:49,060
small you'll know nothing about weird
thing about Mueller and it just kind of

306
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,330
fits here in California like
you know I've obviously I five.

307
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,743
So for

308
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:00,000
black tailed you are very very similar
to Mueller Columbia blacks also in

309
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:03,570
California have Colombia Black Tail
Washington Oregon you have colony black to

310
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:07,140
eventually get up to the north of just
north on the coast you get to the B.C.

311
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:11,610
Alaska border these are calling them six
black tail sick of black tails man you

312
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:14,520
look at them like they almost looked
like a white tail but they're a black

313
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:19,440
tailed deer the Columbia Black Tail
resembles much more Amelia for record

314
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:24,441
keeping purposes the divided between
the range of the Colombia mule deer I'm

315
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:29,940
sorry the divide between the range the
Colombian black tail and the Mehldau is I

316
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,620
5 really.

317
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,680
So if that's some jumps the road he
is for for record keeping purposes he

318
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:41,790
because he he goes from being a Columbia
black tail to a mule deer so you look

319
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:46,050
like the all the record book Columbia
black tails you know are shot along the

320
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,220
the the left side of I five on a northward
direction because they're just like

321
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,160
so you know they're much bigger than
anywhere else but they gotta divide it

322
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:54,370
somewhere it's divide divided like that.

323
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,500
So when one thing's life he
could jump back and forth.

324
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,370
They're not even recognizes as distinct
if you look at the Latin name for him

325
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:05,730
you know the scientific name for him
there like taxonomy is don't recognize the

326
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:08,880
difference but we all do it like you
look at I mean like that's not a I mean

327
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,170
older man I can tell by looking but it's
just these morphological differences

328
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:17,910
these things you see but they're not
really betrayed in them you know in the

329
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:22,911
genetics that's fascinating man that's
it's so interesting trying to track the

330
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:27,460
history of these animals and somebody
actually did that and figured out yeah and

331
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,240
it changes all time yeah they use it like
this one is like my old man he used to

332
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:37,241
reject so much this stuff because it
would change but while you say this so no

333
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:42,280
made it look well they were saying the
best understanding and now this is the

334
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,960
you know it's not static subject to
change but it's frustrating for people.

335
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,910
I'm glad you're on this week because this
is a week that's pretty controversial

336
00:20:52,911 --> 00:20:53,390
in the news.

337
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:58,390
This story about this black rhino that
they auctioned off a hunt for this is

338
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,850
some fascinating shit to me because
fill me in. Do you know the story.

339
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,640
I only know I know no
more than what you said.

340
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,980
I've been I've been at the thing oh all
week. Oh you are the shot show. Yes.

341
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,650
I haven't even.
There is a.

342
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,580
They they auctioned off a hunt
for a black rhino in the winter.

343
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,460
Paid three hundred fifty thousand
dollars to shoot this rhino.

344
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,170
There's only like X amount of thousand
of them left in the world and people are

345
00:21:24,171 --> 00:21:27,110
going fucking bananas can I guess that
they're using that three hundred fifty

346
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:31,530
thousand dollars to put up enforcement.
Yes they can.

347
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,550
For conservation they generated over a
million dollars in the auction. Really.

348
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,360
Allegedly. Yeah. And what.

349
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,500
What they're saying is that this rhino
had to go anyway because this rhino was

350
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:46,580
an old non breeder and he was very
aggressive and he was trying to kill the

351
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:51,080
younger males. And because it's an extinct
or because it's an endangered species.

352
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,990
This was an animal that they were going
to have to do something about anyway.

353
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,340
And really.
Yeah.

354
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,210
They would have either had to I guess
put him in animal prison or they're going

355
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:02,750
to have to fucking shoot him.
So they decided to auction off.

356
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,350
They have this very specific animal that
they've targeted this old non breeding

357
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:07,184
male.

358
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:12,310
And the guy who auction who won the
auction is now in fear of his life.

359
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,690
I mean the really the press is has
he gone and done it. No not yet.

360
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,160
He lives in Dallas or just outside of
Dallas and he don't know if I was going to

361
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:23,370
pick what town he lived in.

362
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,890
I was going to ask you about that too
because Texas is a fucking strange place

363
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:32,270
man. You know it's way
different wildlife model. Yes.

364
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:37,690
Since being introduced to hunting by you
I've become pretty obsessed and I read

365
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:43,700
about it all the time and I'm trying to
sort out all the different philosophies

366
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:45,830
and try to figure out why
people think what they think.

367
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,860
But what I'm most fascinated by
in Texas is these wild game farms.

368
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,500
Is a really weird thing they do where
they'll they I saw some online that were

369
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:02,300
like fucking 70 acres and they have a
high fence and people pretending that

370
00:23:02,301 --> 00:23:03,410
they're hunting in these things.

371
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,300
Yeah they'll sometimes set
the animal out on the day.

372
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,850
It's it's crazy. I mean it's but it's
something. But let's come back round it.

373
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,550
I want to talk for me about
the I the the rhino thing.

374
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,580
There are versions of that
here and we can talk about.

375
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,700
I can talk in a much more educated
where you're much more knowledgeable

376
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:29,470
fashioned about versions of that that
occur here in the U.S. but like I've never

377
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:34,471
been to Africa I haven't hunted in Africa
I have ill like ill informed opinions

378
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:38,110
about what goes on in Africa but I
recognize when it comes to stuff like this

379
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,820
it's there are so many contradictions
that are hard to deal with.

380
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,870
And it's really difficult. People get
their heads wrapped around why a guy

381
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,750
you know I don't know.
Not knowing the person.

382
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,980
I can't say that the person is saying
who's like oh I would just as happily give

383
00:23:55,981 --> 00:24:00,981
you the money to help save rhinos but
if this one has to go anyways I suppose

384
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:01,824
I'll come and get it.

385
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,220
You know I don't really know what his
motivations are his motivations are not

386
00:24:05,221 --> 00:24:09,630
that he he's a part of a big
game trophy hunting group.

387
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,430
Yeah.

388
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,810
He's never gonna be he's not gonna build
bring it back into the U.S. probably.

389
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,230
I don't know. I don't know. I mean
I know what he was trying to do.

390
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,730
I don't know he's planning to do.

391
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,450
I don't know but I know I've been reading
all these articles of the interview.

392
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,560
The guy he's afraid of his life.

393
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,690
I mean they're talking about skinning
his children alive. Is that right.

394
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,530
Oh it's fucking you know animal
rights people get pretty crazy.

395
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,800
Can I tell you about it can I tell you
about a parallel like a parallel thing

396
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:32,850
that goes on the U.S.

397
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,080
It's like I just can't speak to it they're
like I don't even know who is owned

398
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,910
the rhino. I mean is an honor.
Is it like Sonic conservation.

399
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,040
It's not a concession.

400
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,890
Well what they're doing is they have like
you know X amount of thousands of them

401
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,690
and they need money in order to maintain
the pride. Who is they force it.

402
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,290
That's a good question.
I don't know.

403
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,150
Yeah let me talk about a parallel thing
that happens in the U.S. if you're

404
00:24:57,151 --> 00:24:58,270
interested. Yes. Get

405
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,490
in the US we have we
abide by the basic notion.

406
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,910
This is generally true in the US
that wildlife longs to people.

407
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:13,020
So if you have us take an imaginary elk
in this imaginary elk is on the also

408
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:19,201
National Park and one day the elk jumps
the fence and lands on national forest

409
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:25,111
and Montana jumps on a fence and his
own state forest in Montana and he jumps

410
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:29,240
another fence and he's on
a big ranch in Montana.

411
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,330
Throughout that animal's day he has
always been U.S. he's always belong to the

412
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:38,154
people.

413
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,380
When he's in Montana he's belong to like
the state of Montana is in charge for

414
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:44,214
his management.

415
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,600
So we have this idea in a rough sense
we have this idea that we maintain here

416
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:53,601
that the wildlife is held in the public
trust an individual can control access

417
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:57,290
to his lands for hunting but
the animal belongs to state.

418
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,480
You don't get to make
decisions necessarily about
the things that are on your

419
00:26:00,481 --> 00:26:01,314
property.

420
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:07,060
And that's been something that like the
Americans and particularly the American

421
00:26:07,061 --> 00:26:08,740
hundreds of AHS been proud of.

422
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,530
We had this like North American model of
wildlife conservation we always talked

423
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:16,531
about which is this idea of public trust
wildlife and that we manage it in long

424
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:20,110
term things because people have a
vested interest in having more and more

425
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,690
animals around for whatever
purpose viewing hunting et cetera.

426
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,500
One of the things they do though and so
you take an animal like like the bighorn

427
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,630
sheep in the bighorn sheep at a
time was pretty nearly wiped out.

428
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,390
I mean they were hurt.

429
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,080
They were never hurt and as bad as black
rhinos but they were hurt and really

430
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:38,790
bad. And as we got them restored we
started having limited numbers of tags.

431
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,520
May have a mountain range and every
year they determine that we can kill one

432
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:46,420
sheep out of that range and
people will do this every year.

433
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,560
People will apply for a lottery that's
conducted by the state and you put your

434
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:51,370
name in the hat.

435
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:56,370
You pay a fee they you know put all the
names they're drawing out be like Dave

436
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,440
draws a tag and this generates a
whole bunch more and they use it for

437
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,670
tranquilizing sheep that
you can helicopter in the
new areas and restore the

438
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:06,560
species and all the funding
comes to this kind of stuff.

439
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,280
One thing they realize a great way to
make money is if you can get that up

440
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:13,550
blessing you can kill five out of that
mountain range they might want it gone.

441
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,810
We're going to you know we'll do four
through the lottery which is for everyone

442
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,840
like the common man's pool but we're going
take one and auctioned off every year

443
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:25,990
the one the bighorn sheep take
they auctioned in Montana.

444
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,280
It goes for two hundred three hundred
four hundred thousand dollars.

445
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,260
Every year I mean I think
reasoning went for 380 or 4.

446
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,520
I mean it is always up there.
I don't I don't think.

447
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,790
I don't think it's broken a half million
but it goes up because if you go out in

448
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,370
Montana and you go hunt six if
you go on the Missouri Breaks

449
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,720
all the record book Big
Horns come out of there. OK.

450
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,810
Like the biggest big horns the biggest
Rocky Mountain big horns come out of the

451
00:27:49,811 --> 00:27:50,050
break.

452
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,780
So guys will pay a ton for the gut what
they call the governors tag in Montana.

453
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:59,790
And it raises a ton of money and it does
a ton of good but some people feel I

454
00:28:00,431 --> 00:28:01,540
see both sides this argument.

455
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Some people feel like that bit of money
is not worth the damage you're doing by

456
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,463
upsetting

457
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,480
this idea of democratically
own and ministered wildlife
like most guys will put

458
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:18,350
in their entire life or a big ownership
tag you know pay the fee every year and

459
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:19,430
they have no chance.

460
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,520
I've been putting in for that tag
for 14 years I've accumulated.

461
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,760
They started a bonus points system 12
years ago and a bonus point system is that

462
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:31,770
every year you put it in the next year
you get a you get up every year you put

463
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:36,410
him without being successful you get a
point in a square year points so next

464
00:28:36,411 --> 00:28:39,890
year my name will go in the hat
one hundred and forty four times.

465
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,190
If you did it for your first year
your name will go on that one time.

466
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,210
Even with my name in the hat one hundred
forty four times I don't think I'm even

467
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:49,970
up to having a 1 percent chance
of drawing a big horn sheep tag.

468
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,650
So meanwhile guy come in
and he makes much money.

469
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,530
One guy that buys lately made a
lot of money selling sandwiches.

470
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,350
He comes in and he's like me buying
one of those and I'll buy it next year.

471
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,730
And people like all that
money is so useful and it is.

472
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,640
People are like Dude this is not the
country we live in because we're still

473
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,860
we're still kind of hurting from the idea
of where we came from in Europe which

474
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:17,120
is like the Robin Hood model.

475
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,320
You gotta be rich to hunt a lot of
people don't know that the Robin Hood was

476
00:29:21,321 --> 00:29:22,910
actually based on hunting.
Yeah.

477
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,210
It wasn't based on stealing money
from the rich and giving to the poor.

478
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,920
It's based on the poor
weren't allowed to hunt.

479
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,820
Yeah. He would go out and hunt
the Kings animals and he used it.

480
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,510
I mean at the even at the time when our
ancestors were like first coming over

481
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:41,090
you they could kill you for hunting they
kill you for hunting and then you had

482
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:41,924
to be rich to hunt.

483
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,530
So when guys like you think I like the
story of Daniel Boone man he came out and

484
00:29:45,531 --> 00:29:49,010
he's like Jesus whole you know
his relatives came from England.

485
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,810
He comes over here is like man
this whole freaking country.

486
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,710
I go hunt wherever I want.

487
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,160
So people really fell in love with that
idea of freedom and you know and that

488
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:58,400
you kind of roam around and the
animals were there free for the taking.

489
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,560
And now we're a little bit upsetting
this model but all the people who were on

490
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:05,690
the other side of this say
the but the money so helpful.

491
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,780
And it wasn't for big chunks of money
like that we wouldn't have recovered the

492
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:12,800
bighorn sheep as effectively as we've
recovered the bighorn sheep and it's not

493
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:17,320
cheap you know three or four hundred
thousand dollars for a tag is incredible.

494
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,210
Type in Montana governor's tab you'll
see what it went for last time.

495
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,150
Do they sometimes fail.
I mean they must must.

496
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:28,450
I heard a story where the guys that the
guys that buy it once you spend that

497
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:31,350
kind of money you want to
rule out uncertain and you
know that you can picture

498
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:32,184
the area right.
Yeah.

499
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,400
You know all this stuff he floated through
and we saw when a guy I'll buy what I

500
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:36,780
want a guy held by the governor's tab.

501
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,840
He'll usually hire some guides or he'll
hire some guys to go spend a couple of

502
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:47,031
months they'll put together a dossier
on the animals that are in the area.

503
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,140
Yeah man. Oh my God. That's ridiculous.

504
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,330
A scout and when they
find one they stay on.

505
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,430
These guys just specialize
in this business.

506
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,380
Look at that four hundred and
eighty thousand dollar bid.

507
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,180
The record for 2013.
Oh my God.

508
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,140
Four hundred and eighty thousand
dollars somebody paid for the tag.

509
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,550
Look at those dudes going to war.

510
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:09,240
Yeah sack is kind of tucked up to the
left he can't really appreciate it. Yeah.

511
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,670
We we showed that video the other day
of you talking about wanting to eat it.

512
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,380
So it's valuable to people. It's
a ton of money. Not the sack.

513
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,230
No no not Zach. No but it really makes
people mad. Yes. There is a story.

514
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,020
And how do you know it's true.

515
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,920
I heard it from enough people
I tend to think it's true.

516
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,450
So these guys go out and they'll get
a guy they'll get guys out there.

517
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,170
They find a tanker you know
they want to ram it scored.

518
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,130
This got over 200 inches of horn or more.

519
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,430
And they file and they don't
let it out of their eyes. Right.

520
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:42,040
They stand up stand down and eventually
the guy comes out and they go.

521
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,960
There he is that's the one you want a few.

522
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:47,430
There's a rumor a few years ago this guy
had done this need spent all this money.

523
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,230
I think I heard. I'm just telling you
unsubstantiated stuff I'm nothing Tony.

524
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:55,110
I'm not telling you what year or is names
I don't because I want to say that and

525
00:31:55,111 --> 00:32:00,111
be wrong about what a high roller buys
this thing pays a figure rumored to be

526
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,440
around 30 grand to have some guy fired.

527
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,920
Check this out it comes down to it and
guys like third one from the front third

528
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:10,200
one from the front.
They go down and the goalie

529
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,800
get mixed round and she was in
it goes or is wrong one. Bam.

530
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,700
Rumor has it that that he
that this gentleman later
bought another one went out

531
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:25,480
and bought another went out and got a
big fatty so he might have spent five

532
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:27,000
hundred six hundred grand.

533
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,600
I and man I see it like it tears me up
because like everything in life it's so

534
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:37,230
complicated. I see both sides
of it. Like I love our system.

535
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,780
I love the idea that
wildlife is public trust.

536
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,960
And I think that the like there's no
other way to explain the success of of the

537
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,150
richness of animals and the riches of
rulers habitats we have in this country

538
00:32:51,151 --> 00:32:54,630
when you look at how many people live
here how wealthy we are what we call the

539
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:57,460
technology. Like so many other countries
that would be sitting where we're at.

540
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Have destroyed their wildlife you know
but we have a very in place like a very

541
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:04,230
intact system.

542
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,740
And we've done a fantastic job and I
think that one of the ways you explain the

543
00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:12,330
fantastic job we've done is that we really
held true to this idea that wildlife

544
00:33:12,331 --> 00:33:13,470
belongs to us.

545
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:18,890
And when you do damage to it you're
doing damage to this idea of you know an

546
00:33:20,401 --> 00:33:23,490
American treasure you're damaging
other people's interests.

547
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,630
So yeah man it's complicated. So that's
my long way of answering. The rhino thing.

548
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,020
I'm.

549
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:36,020
I bet you anything it is extremely
complex complicated and there is emotion

550
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,890
battling logic.

551
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,970
I'm amazed that it's cheaper to kill a
fucking rhino than it is a big horned

552
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:45,560
sheep that is mine.

553
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,100
It is amazing doesn't
buy me 100 grand plus.

554
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,630
That's crazy.

555
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,710
That's amazing. What's the
ivory worth. Not worth that.

556
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,150
I don't think they have ivory. They have
horns. Their horn is made at a hair.

557
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,680
A rhino has no black rhinos got.
No.

558
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,630
Oh rhino horn is not ivory but it's
very valuable. Yeah it's not ivory.

559
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,750
No no it's it's valuable because they're
idiots because people think that it

560
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:09,620
makes your dick hard.

561
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,830
And like I guess they haven't heard
about Vi Agger wherever the fuck they're

562
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:14,090
trying out rhino horn.

563
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,160
But I went to I went there did I mean
just like three days ago I saw the act the

564
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:21,920
current head of the U.S. I went to see
the current head of the U.S. Fish and

565
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:25,340
Wildlife Service speak about some issues
that we'll be facing this year in the

566
00:34:25,341 --> 00:34:30,300
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is getting
really involved in the rhino trade and

567
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,540
we talk about all the money they're
spending you know spending money and

568
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:36,710
enforcement you're spending money on
trying to battle the sauce like that you

569
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:39,620
might somehow convince people
that they don't want it.

570
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,760
You know all the things you would do.

571
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,970
I mean really think about the millions
and millions of dollars of Tarmoh thrown

572
00:34:43,971 --> 00:34:48,530
around a member being like to bet you
can't go find any guy who wants to go get

573
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:51,590
one. You'd give him more money than
he's ever gonna make hunting them.

574
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,920
Yeah but doesn't the world doesn't work
that way because some other day would be

575
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:59,450
like but nobody like you would make
every rhino poacher really wealthy.

576
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:03,230
Yeah and they just be like Okay cool
I'll quit. But it wouldn't work.

577
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,520
And other people come along
to be a rhino poacher too.

578
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,630
No I know but I've never heard a thing
of those guys could only know the amount.

579
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,630
Because you know they're
not like no matter what like
that business I don't like

580
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,070
moat the guys that are actually out there
with firearms you can imagine the guy

581
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:21,020
that's out on the ground hunting rhinos
being chased by people who have pretty

582
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:24,110
much a license to in some cases kill them.

583
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,450
Like I don't think that guy is a rich man.

584
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,340
He's he's making someone wealthy but
there's no way that that guy is rich.

585
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,640
And not only that it's
just such a bizarre thing.

586
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,760
The idea of shooting this giant majestic
endangered animal just for its horn and

587
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,010
they're not eating them they're
not doing anything else with them.

588
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,870
They're just shooting them
and taking their horns.

589
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:49,370
And there's no real medicinal value. It's
not like the rhino would be one thing.

590
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,390
The rhino horn had this incredible anti
aging property and it turned you into a

591
00:35:53,391 --> 00:35:54,500
young person again.

592
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,470
Well you know they'd probably fucking
kill every Rhino they could find.

593
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,820
But it doesn't do anything it doesn't
really do anything but think about what

594
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:05,300
it's just but it's it's probably I
mean it's it's an issue of poverty.

595
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,990
Yeah and of that justifies mom saying
like I don't even know the guys that are

596
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:10,890
out poaching rhinos.

597
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,310
They might not even have any idea who it
is that they might have like some vague

598
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:18,700
awareness about the properties but all of
they believe in the properties as well.

599
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:23,130
Yeah I'm a little bit ignorant about
who's actually wanting these rhino horns

600
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,660
what I've heard it's an Asian thing.

601
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,610
But it seems to be one of the
most bizarre misunderstandings and

602
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,650
miscommunications ever in this day and
age with all the information that's

603
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:36,070
available especially because
it's always about penises.

604
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,340
It's always about guys. Well it's a foul.
Getting a red it isn't foul Yeah yeah.

605
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,110
It's gonna be just that
it's a nice phallus. Mm hmm.

606
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,850
But they did grind it up
for medicine man only.

607
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,210
It's so strange.

608
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:53,770
I mean it's an amazing animal when you
look at a rhino it to me I mean it's one

609
00:36:53,771 --> 00:36:58,300
of the closest things when you look
like a triceratops or a stegosaurus or

610
00:36:58,301 --> 00:37:01,960
something like that and you look at a
rhino it's like one of the closest things

611
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,550
to that ancient time you look at this
big fucking giant armored animal.

612
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,660
It's a strange strange animal you know
and the idea that people are killing it

613
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:14,090
to make their dick hard is
just so bizarre and and.

614
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,580
But no they're killing it to make money.

615
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,390
Yeah people are buying it together
to make the big art. Yeah.

616
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,090
And it's not even working.
You know it's just so strange.

617
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:25,960
We shouldn't have.

618
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,630
We should make a public service
announcement right now we'll have dropped

619
00:37:28,631 --> 00:37:31,990
leaflets over China just it doesn't work.

620
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:37,100
His bags full of aggro drop them with
parachutes just just launch them you know.

621
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,650
Yeah.

622
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,270
Isn't it amazing like in that way that
this stuff now I'd be like no do this

623
00:37:43,271 --> 00:37:43,960
really does work.

624
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,630
I mean like you to the point where
it could cause trouble for you try.

625
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,500
Well we have to go to a doctor
because your dick won't go down.

626
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,040
It works on everybody too.

627
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:57,210
Works on dying people chew up a biography
of a zombie dick and your parents

628
00:37:57,311 --> 00:38:00,260
scratching at your zipper those veins
and you think that there would be no.

629
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,020
Do you think that the pharmaceutical
industry would would not the pharma that

630
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,940
what's what's the word the
effort like the aphrodisiac.

631
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,970
Yeah.
Guess what.

632
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,070
What is the term.

633
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,540
No I'm saying what is the term for like
something that you look you want Asian

634
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,630
whore or are you wanting
for these all right. Yeah.

635
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:25,020
Did the aphrodisiac market for men would
you know these Dick hardening market

636
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:28,360
for men would evaporate.

637
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:32,070
Well now that there are pharmaceuticals
there specifically tailored for that and

638
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,370
are clinically proven to work.

639
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,360
Well that's how you know that's how the
American troops get information about

640
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:42,361
the Taliban from the Afghani warlords
is vagaries and no one method of payment

641
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,320
really.

642
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,890
Yeah because these guys a lot of these
warlords you know though they're live in

643
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:51,030
like the same way they lived back
when Alexander the Great was running

644
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,710
Afghanistan.

645
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:56,710
Afghanistan has Kabul and then mountains
and mountains filled with villages and

646
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,440
extremely primitive locations and you
know that they're live in old school and

647
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,460
sometimes as a guy who's a warlord who's
got 20 wives and his dick doesn't work

648
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:07,270
anymore.

649
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,910
And you know they come along and they
go look we've got guns it's like I got

650
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:13,640
guns and we got women I've got 20
wives and I can even fuck them.

651
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,210
Oh listen check this out.

652
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,200
Give him a bottle of pills and guys like
listen these Taliban Fox I never liked

653
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:20,770
them.

654
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,750
They're hiding over there.
Those guys are over there.

655
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:27,100
How many more pills you got to give
these guys cases cases of Niagara.

656
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,140
They tell them everything.
They can't stop talking.

657
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,590
Yeah I've heard a big mac diplomacy.
That's the way via diplomacy.

658
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,050
That that that actually works.

659
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,820
I'm 40 years old month.

660
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,520
You ready to get it on the
vagaries that we try to tell me.

661
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,270
No I'm saying it's

662
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,330
back to this.
This rhino thing you're talking about.

663
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,620
Yeah.
I just can't I can't.

664
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:55,810
I just my head wants to blow up because
I just I see all sides of it. I do.

665
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,740
But that's beautiful.

666
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:01,300
I think that's important the part I don't
see the part I do not see though for

667
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:06,301
me is I don't like I would never like
I don't have that desire to hunt one of

668
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:10,440
those. But so much of that
kind thing is in his heart.

669
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,990
People that don't understand so much
that kind of stuff comes from context you

670
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:18,991
know well you develop over time a deep
context with an animal and for me that

671
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,760
familiarity in the hours you spend the
hours you log watching it understanding

672
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:29,761
it reading about it starting it for me
develops into something like produce is a

673
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:31,690
great desire to hunt the animal.

674
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,870
Once I get to know it an animal that I
don't know well I don't have any desire.

675
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,990
I don't have that much desire to hunt
for it but when I watch him and watch him

676
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:44,980
and watch him like like bighorn sheep
when I'm when I moved to Montana when I

677
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:48,220
was born Amish when I moved to Montana
I didn't go out there being like Man I

678
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:49,720
cannot wait.
I'm bighorn sheep.

679
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,590
But after spending years and years and
years out you know glassing for deer

680
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:57,310
glassing for elk glassing for bears
and like Big Horn Big Horn Big Horn.

681
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,130
And I really got through.
I love to watch big horns.

682
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:04,570
I liked everything about big horns and
in time all that man would someday love

683
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:08,140
to have an opportunity to go a big horn.
And it was born from that.

684
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,470
So when I say that I have no desire to
hunt Ryan I'll be like it's just like it

685
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:15,940
would be to me like like honing margins
like I just don't have any you know

686
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,900
familiarity with it.
It just doesn't like culturally.

687
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,830
I haven't read about it
my whole life I haven't.

688
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:25,080
Like when I go and look at calendars
like hunters love wildlife counters and

689
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,060
it's like all the stuff we like to hunt
you know you don't grow up looking at

690
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:30,620
like the Ryan O page on a
one on a hunting calendar.

691
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,620
It's just I just have no context with it.

692
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,220
And this gentleman that that bought
this thing I don't know. I don't know.

693
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,500
I don't know anything about him.
I'd love to talk to him.

694
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,300
He doesn't want to come on your podcast.

695
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,220
Yeah.
I don't think he wants to but he's he's.

696
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:49,410
His name is Corey Knowlton and he's
got a private security detail following

697
00:41:50,651 --> 00:41:52,080
around all the time now.

698
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:58,230
He's giving this interview for this
interview with CNN and he's talking about

699
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,620
the people of threatened his kids because
he has people threatening to kill him

700
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:06,220
right now that I have to talk to the
FBI have my private security keep my

701
00:42:06,221 --> 00:42:10,530
children from being skinned alive and
shot at a little hyperbole a lot of people

702
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:12,950
are just talking shit. I'm not
going to kill your fucking kids man.

703
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,740
They're not murderers but people get
angry when they hear about someone hunting

704
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:20,220
something as a trophy and absolute.

705
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,010
I think that there's a big distinction
between you wanting to hunt a big horn

706
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:27,740
sheep because you you follow it
and you study it and because.

707
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,250
But you eat the fucking sheep.
Yeah that's that's a difference man.

708
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,660
There's something creepy about wanting
to shoot something just so you could

709
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:35,980
stuff it and put it in your room

710
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,680
Yeah it's complicated it's complicated
it's complicated it is that that is like

711
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,280
it would feel very if I did
shoot the rhino I would eat them.

712
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,430
There's no way I wouldn't eat them.
Are they edible. They must be. Oh yeah.

713
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,520
Lead elephants.

714
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,900
I know that you shoot an elephant in
the village as friends of mine that have

715
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:02,380
hunted and friends of mine
that hunting in Alaska.

716
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,990
Sorry friend by the hunted in Africa.

717
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,900
Kind of marvel at the
rapidity with which like.

718
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:13,990
Like how or how quickly the animals get
hauled off and consume as it is like

719
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:16,840
not a lot of waste.

720
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,420
You know there are some animals that you
look at and you think they'd be really

721
00:43:19,421 --> 00:43:21,180
good they're not very
popular and other animals.

722
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,890
You'd look at and you wouldn't think
would be that great and the really popular

723
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,133
table fare.

724
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,570
I don't know what the reputation of
rhino is but elephants are popular.

725
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,500
People like the elephant.

726
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:33,590
My problem with Alice my understanding
they're intelligent that bothers me.

727
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,160
Yeah yeah. Intelligent animals. It
bothers me. I have no desire to hunt one.

728
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,950
But again I have no context.
No I don't and I don't really understand

729
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,400
for me to go.

730
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,860
Like for me to go Huntsman also have to
know that it's sound that it isn't as

731
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,713
safe.

732
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:52,900
Position and one nice thing about
live in the U.S. I mean there's some

733
00:43:52,901 --> 00:43:57,220
exceptions to this but generally in the
US like if you want to be if you want to

734
00:43:57,221 --> 00:44:01,780
be ethical about your hunting practices
in the U.S. you can generally look to

735
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:04,180
the guidance of your state
Fish and Game agency.

736
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,890
I mean the state Fish and Game agency

737
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,730
get away with.

738
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,210
I mean theoretically can't get away
with and practically can't get away with

739
00:44:13,211 --> 00:44:17,170
running a species into the ground.
You know it would be big trouble for them.

740
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,550
So generally if you if you're looking in
and you realize that there's a you know

741
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:26,380
there's a population of big horns and
there's some and there is a hunting season

742
00:44:26,381 --> 00:44:29,560
form right now it's it's OK.

743
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:32,410
I mean it really is OK if there's if
they're finding a decline in that thing

744
00:44:32,411 --> 00:44:35,110
they're going to curb it or cut it out
altogether and wait till it's growing

745
00:44:35,111 --> 00:44:35,710
again.

746
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:39,580
And then you can also look at their long
term goal of you know where they want

747
00:44:39,581 --> 00:44:41,470
animals. How many animals I
think the area can support.

748
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,200
So it's easy in the U.S. cause
this stuff is watch so much.

749
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,640
Obviously again coming from
guy to spending time in
Africa I know that in Africa

750
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:53,260
like money talks in a way that it
doesn't necessarily hear when it comes to

751
00:44:53,261 --> 00:44:55,030
small issues like like wildlife.

752
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,390
You can buy your way into things that
maybe you don't have any real ethical

753
00:44:58,391 --> 00:45:02,710
business doing you know in the
U.S. is just easier to kind of.

754
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,780
There's a lot more information at our
fingertips so for me when I when I go

755
00:45:05,781 --> 00:45:09,530
hunting I can really kind of read up and
understand a lot about what I'm going

756
00:45:09,531 --> 00:45:11,220
after where it's at.

757
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,700
What the management goals are what risk
the animal has is hunting it you know

758
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:20,420
productive and helpful right now as it is
potentially detrimental to the species.

759
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,190
And you can make your decisions.

760
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,230
It is amazing how good a job the
Department of Fish and Game or what is the

761
00:45:27,231 --> 00:45:28,670
actual group what are they called.

762
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,920
Well there's the state so you have U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service which is that

763
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:36,970
which is a federal thing and so they have
a hand in they have a hand in managing

764
00:45:37,131 --> 00:45:40,560
migratory waterfowl but
most things are managed by.

765
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:44,440
So every state has a you know you kind
of like just in general terms you calm

766
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:48,440
fish and game but it's like in Michigan
it's the Michigan Department of Natural

767
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:52,880
Resources in Montana's Montana
Department of Fish Wildlife and Parks.

768
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,580
But just as a euphemism
versus fish and game.

769
00:45:55,610 --> 00:46:00,610
So you know every state the D department
environmental conservation in New York.

770
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:05,450
So every state has a different name
but it's a State Department that sets

771
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,720
hunting and fishing
regulations in the new state.

772
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:12,650
The powers to be big boards and they'll
be be the people that said it will be

773
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:16,250
biologists various figures
different stakeholders.

774
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,790
So you'd have representatives from the
hunting community representatives who are

775
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:23,990
outside of the hunting community will
all come together and come to some level

776
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:28,991
of cohesion and in some level you know
they'll find a happy middle ground when

777
00:46:29,061 --> 00:46:33,740
they set their quotas and they often mean
they meet every year to determine what

778
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:34,670
can be done and not done.

779
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:39,650
And they can control harvest number
ways by issuing tags shortening seasons

780
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:44,651
lengthening seasons you can if you want
to slow down the harvest you might move

781
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,580
the season away from the rut.

782
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,930
You know if you want to pick up a harvest
kill females you know if you want to

783
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,780
if you want to bring a population
down because of various factors like

784
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:58,810
agricultural interests auto insurers you
know generally want like generally want

785
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:03,500
deer numbers lower agricultural interests
generally want deer numbers lower

786
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,400
landscape people often
want deer numbers lower.

787
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,140
So to kind of factor like their concerns
and you got the concerns of people who

788
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:13,790
want hunters want more deer they want to
see more deer around and you figure all

789
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:17,660
this out there's all these management
tools to try to find a way you know to

790
00:47:17,661 --> 00:47:18,410
tweak things.

791
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,950
Another thing is predator
control if you're if you
have a population it's really

792
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:26,270
hurting you go in there and do predator
control in that area and sometimes you

793
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:29,330
can bring you know you can bring
some animals back from the brink.

794
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,800
It's possible to lose isolated populations
like it's possible to have a mountain

795
00:47:33,801 --> 00:47:38,540
range and you get a you spend few hundred
thousand dollars a million dollars

796
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:41,630
would ever move in some big horns in there
and you find that you're just getting

797
00:47:41,631 --> 00:47:45,260
hammered by lions and you will lose all
the sheep and lose your whole investment

798
00:47:45,261 --> 00:47:48,950
you might go in there and hit those
lions a little bit you know save them.

799
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:53,980
So there's so many tools at their disposal
but you know in general in general

800
00:47:55,131 --> 00:47:59,200
there are exceptions in general I think
that I'm always amazed how well the

801
00:47:59,201 --> 00:48:01,630
state Fish and Game agencies do Yeah
that's what I was going to say it's

802
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,750
probably one of the most efficient
government agencies ever.

803
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:08,980
They're good and you know everything
about them is is they don't get a lot of

804
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:14,250
hard funding there's not many agencies
like get so much of their funding from

805
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:18,930
license sales and so firearms taxes.

806
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:22,050
That's why there's so there's a lot of
conservation money out there right now

807
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,310
because the gun businesses have been
blown up as people feel that their gun

808
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:27,420
rights are under attack.

809
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,930
They've been buying so many firearms and
puts money in the you know the Pittman

810
00:48:30,931 --> 00:48:35,110
Robertson filing is called
that gold conservation stuff.

811
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:39,310
There's excise taxes on firearms excise
taxes on ammunition excise taxes on

812
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:41,500
sporting goods.
All your license fees.

813
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,040
Every guy whoever hunts
ducks are migratory birds has
to buy a federal waterfall

814
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:49,060
stamp state waterfalls stamp all his
money plows in and creates money for

815
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,720
conservation work research and so these
agencies are in large measure some more

816
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:57,790
than others are self-sustaining.

817
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:02,890
You know that's what I find things I know
that you get annoyed by Peter as much

818
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:03,724
as I do.

819
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:09,430
It's like they're not spending the money
on doing this stuff that hunters are

820
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,790
like hunters are are bankrolling so
much of wildlife research and wildlife

821
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:14,540
conservation.

822
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,670
And it's not just stuff that
benefits the animals we're after.

823
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,380
You know my my problem with groups
like PETA or the Animal Liberation

824
00:49:21,381 --> 00:49:25,010
Organization the people that want to
fucking save lobsters and rescue them from

825
00:49:25,011 --> 00:49:26,810
restaurants and thrown
back into the ocean.

826
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:29,820
There's a lot of knee
jerk reactionary nonsense.

827
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,410
It's not based on the actual science
of understanding the population these

828
00:49:33,411 --> 00:49:35,900
animals.
That's what drives me crazy.

829
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,250
When people start getting angry at people
hunting wolves like this is a perfect

830
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:43,700
example there's they've opened up Wolf
season now and a bunch of different

831
00:49:43,701 --> 00:49:47,510
places. And the reason being
is that people's livestock
are getting decimated elk

832
00:49:47,511 --> 00:49:48,920
populations are getting destroyed.

833
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,570
I mean they they have to move in to
control it but to a lot of animal rights

834
00:49:53,571 --> 00:49:58,100
people all they see is bloodthirsty
maniacs that want to kill beautiful wolves

835
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,600
and they don't understand that.

836
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:01,990
First of all a these wolves
have been reintroduced.

837
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:05,930
A lot of these areas and then be like
we're supposed to be the stewards of the

838
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:08,810
land we're supposed to be the intelligent
people that understand the numbers and

839
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:12,240
that something has to be done about it
this isn't something that people decide

840
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:14,390
I'd like kill the wolves
yeah let's make it legal.

841
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,600
Now they're going hey we've got an issue.
What are you going to do.

842
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,360
Let's all meet let's compare data.
Let's see what we got.

843
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,140
Yeah I'm going to do here.
Yeah.

844
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:26,830
You get this idea like oh they've just
one day decided to go in and do it and

845
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:27,940
it's I'm sure you have.

846
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:32,110
On one level you have individuals who
absolutely like a guy opens up his

847
00:50:32,111 --> 00:50:35,890
regulation but he's like walking by a
wolf type does your that individual does

848
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:38,110
not really need here.

849
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,700
That individual does not really need
to understand is nice if he does but he

850
00:50:41,701 --> 00:50:46,060
doesn't need to understand the full
picture because that individual is a tool

851
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,840
being used by managing agencies like we
need to get rid of some wolves we could

852
00:50:52,241 --> 00:50:56,450
bring back the days where we have like
you know government agents going out and

853
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:01,530
gun form or we could open it up and have
people actually pay money to go out and

854
00:51:02,051 --> 00:51:05,170
have the opportunity to try to do
what we need to do anyways you know.

855
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,170
So the guy that goes out I can't always
speak to every guy that goes out in

856
00:51:08,171 --> 00:51:08,650
hunts wolves.

857
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:13,120
I can't speak to his motivations I don't
know but they're servicing a greater

858
00:51:13,121 --> 00:51:17,230
good and that they're being used as a
tool that winds up being an economic

859
00:51:17,231 --> 00:51:17,860
driver.

860
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,740
Which kind of like points to
the efficiency of wildlife
management is like you

861
00:51:20,741 --> 00:51:24,820
could hire the job out which in some cases
it does because there are you know we

862
00:51:24,821 --> 00:51:27,040
do have government trappers
do some Wolf control.

863
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:30,310
But it's kind of nice that you can one
up turn like rather than you're paying

864
00:51:30,311 --> 00:51:31,144
someone to go out and do it.

865
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:35,640
You can have people pay for
the opportunity to go and
do what we know needs to

866
00:51:35,641 --> 00:51:39,840
be done. And in these cases we're going
to have to get rid of half the lower Wolf

867
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:42,270
numbers.
No one's not that no one is.

868
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,990
No one's arguing for like a
new extra patient of the wolf.

869
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:50,790
That would be in the worst
interests of the managing agencies.

870
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,690
The last thing Wyoming would want now.

871
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:57,720
Like you guys they get the
wolves delisted. People
are suing to stop the deal.

872
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:59,790
You know the de-listing Wyoming
gets the wolves delisted.

873
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:04,380
They're going to control no one in Wyoming
and the government would like to see

874
00:52:04,381 --> 00:52:07,740
wolves wiped out and put back
on the endangered species list.

875
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,460
It'd be the worst thing that
could possibly happen for them.

876
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,570
There's no interest to
like extra paid them.

877
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:16,800
You know no one's arguing for extra
patients is bringing them into control

878
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:21,830
because we are puppeteers you know I mean
there's a lot of people living here in

879
00:52:23,371 --> 00:52:26,910
your backyard you're like really
balancing a lot of interests you know.

880
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,350
And so again it's like

881
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:34,090
like so much in life you really have
to take before jumping to the stuff the

882
00:52:34,091 --> 00:52:36,400
emotions of you really have to take
the time to look at this stuff.

883
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,280
It's a long complicated issue.

884
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,850
It's long there's a lot of factors
and we haven't gotten into ballistics

885
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:44,183
ballistics.

886
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,720
No one else trying six now I'll try to
explain you all the different caliber.

887
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:52,470
That's not to say it's like the whole
world of yes it's that's kind of why I

888
00:52:52,751 --> 00:52:56,050
love all this stuff man. It's like
it's like chess or something. Well

889
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:57,940
there's new things to
learn that's for sure.

890
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:03,270
You know before long before I ever even
thought about hunting I would see a

891
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:08,530
beautiful deer and I'd be like Why would
anybody kill that is so cool to look at.

892
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,220
And then you see a few
people hit him with cars.

893
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:16,000
And one time I was driving home I was
doing a gig in upstate New York and I had

894
00:53:16,001 --> 00:53:21,001
to drive home like 30 miles an hour
at the most because fuckin deer were

895
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:25,120
everywhere is madness. It was in the
middle of summer and I've never seen more.

896
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:29,320
I don't think I've ever seen more than
like two deer my whole life until this

897
00:53:29,321 --> 00:53:33,330
day. And then I'm driving home from
this gig and it was fucking madness.

898
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,020
It was upstate New York in November.

899
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:40,810
I want to say it was the summer but
I it was so long gone. All right.

900
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:44,590
They were out and about fucking madness
just jumping in front of the car left

901
00:53:44,591 --> 00:53:47,500
and right you see them on the side of
the highway and you see men get plastered

902
00:53:47,501 --> 00:53:50,170
by a truck and it opens up
like that thing's made of me.

903
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,860
I had no idea they were exploding.

904
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:58,890
I mean I saw at least four of them that
had exploded and wrecked cars and it was

905
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,570
one of the craziest things
I'd ever seen in my life.

906
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,620
I don't know why there's so many of them
in this one particular area of upstate

907
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:09,100
New York but it was a
really an infestation.

908
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:09,550
Yeah.

909
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:13,360
People are so whacked out too like it's
in those areas in the northeast or you

910
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:17,470
know there's so many deer and they're
like well maybe we can hire snipers to go

911
00:54:17,471 --> 00:54:21,580
out at night and shoot them or give them
a you know we'll put the deer on birth

912
00:54:21,581 --> 00:54:22,690
control.
Yeah.

913
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:26,650
Meanwhile I got all these dudes being
like I've got a great I know the perfect

914
00:54:26,651 --> 00:54:27,310
way.

915
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:31,660
Open up you know suburban urban
bow hunt people pay to come on.

916
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:35,350
Was like no we'd rather pay. I think I'm
in arenas the come out. What was that.

917
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:39,610
By the time they did this deer the town
lauds deer population was all sent down.

918
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:44,620
Had a thousand or more dollars
into each. Do they got rid of.

919
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,230
Well it's going on right now.
You know in the Hamptons.

920
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,030
Do you know what's going
on in the Hamptons.

921
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,620
No I also have overpopulation of
deer. So they're hiring sniper. Yeah.

922
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,960
They're gonna put suppressors on these
guns and go in the middle of the night.

923
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:59,200
They're gonna hand at night so that people
don't have to experience it or freak

924
00:54:59,201 --> 00:55:01,990
out and they're gonna shoot these fucking
deer because there's so many of them.

925
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,830
And then the other argument was let's
let's get them on birth control.

926
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:09,430
They're gonna spend three and a fifty
thousand dollar implant give fucking deer

927
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:13,750
birth control like what are you talking
about this is there was a TV show about

928
00:55:13,751 --> 00:55:14,080
this.

929
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,160
Well it's all to prevent the harrowing
experience that might happen to someone

930
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:22,270
so they wake up in the morning and
realize and see a deer run into their yard

931
00:55:22,271 --> 00:55:26,230
and tip over because they had a heroin
and as much as upsetting as Abby is so

932
00:55:26,231 --> 00:55:30,220
much better to go out and does
that night quietly snipe them off.

933
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:33,040
You know there is a line it all up.

934
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,290
There's a video of this happening in
some other country of. They showed these.

935
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:43,270
That was a joke that video lions released
to deal with the deer population that

936
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:44,700
was like The Onion.

937
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,070
Jamie's googling shit.
Yeah. The Onion you fuck.

938
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:53,100
It was one of those fake onions there's
a bunch of onions now fake onion you

939
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:55,960
know the onion if you don't know is a
parody website site there's a bunch of

940
00:55:55,961 --> 00:56:00,850
fake ones that aren't nearly as good at
like being obvious but there's so fake

941
00:56:00,851 --> 00:56:04,510
that they say the only known him. No no
no. Oh no. They're just like National.

942
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,880
Blah blah blah report.

943
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,940
But they're bullshit they're bullshit
like one of them had a report of the day

944
00:56:09,941 --> 00:56:13,960
that Colorado legalized marijuana
37 people died of an overdose.

945
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:16,900
Oh fucking I can't tell you how
many people sent me that I'm like.

946
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,280
Marijuana is not toxic.

947
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:21,910
You dummies like you you'd literally
have to smoke fifteen hundred pounds of

948
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,500
marijuana in 30 minutes to die.

949
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:28,070
It's not killing anybody stop but these
people you know they read this online

950
00:56:28,071 --> 00:56:31,090
and they think it's true that
there's been a gang of those.

951
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,520
Yeah.
Has anyone ever died like you ever heard.

952
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,650
No one ever dies from marijuana.

953
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,513
It's not possible.

954
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:41,140
You couldn't you physically wouldn't
be able to smoke enough yourself.

955
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,500
The the the L.D.

956
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,820
50 like we've we actually
we're talking about L.D.

957
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,950
50s of thing. That means lethal
lethal dose at 50 percent lethal dose.

958
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:54,040
Oh God I've heard that shit remember.
You know because my brother works in

959
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:59,900
his work involves a little bit not the
user but the understanding of herbicides

960
00:56:59,901 --> 00:57:02,570
and pesticides that he talks about L.D.
50s on pesticides.

961
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,090
Yeah.
Marijuana is so high it's insane.

962
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,910
But there's a lot of things
that have really low L.D.

963
00:57:07,911 --> 00:57:12,911
50s ecstasy for instance like if you
take I think it's 10 or 15 times the

964
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:16,750
effective dose of MDMA you're dead.
Yeah.

965
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,880
You eat 10 ounces of salt if you're a 200
pound man eat 10 ounces of salt you're

966
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:22,904
a goner.

967
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:23,853
Zero.
Yeah.

968
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:28,460
But think of how upset your body gets
when you're snorkeling or something and

969
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,510
you get a couple gulps.

970
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,000
Oh yeah. Or just you start Rach. Yeah it's
salt water. That's a miserable feeling.

971
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:38,930
Well it's also if you want to know if you
have like some sort of bowel issue and

972
00:57:38,931 --> 00:57:43,610
you want to clean out the old pipes a
little bit of it take some Epsom salts and

973
00:57:43,611 --> 00:57:47,780
some water to do a couple of tablespoons
garlic and shove it down the pipe and

974
00:57:47,781 --> 00:57:51,110
it'll be like a broken 5 0.
Oh my goodness.

975
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:54,470
It's it's it's unbelievable.
It's very effective.

976
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,420
I used to wash when I was.

977
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:00,750
I got this job and I was 13
washing dishes at a summer camp.

978
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:06,970
I was washing dishes for campers that
were older and I was and there's a cook

979
00:58:07,241 --> 00:58:08,074
there.

980
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:13,380
Was David S I'll say and when Dad does
he would drink iced tea and I put a bunch

981
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:18,370
of salt in his eyes to mess with him so
he'd sit in a big salt and spit it out

982
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,540
as retribution.

983
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:25,560
He comes up behind me and kind of puts
me in a lock and grabs my forehand and

984
00:58:25,751 --> 00:58:30,751
tips my head back and fills my
mouth with poured salt Yeah.

985
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:35,740
Wow. Gave me some sauce made me
throw up. That's dangerous. Yeah.

986
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
He probably didn't know that you
could die. David S. that fuck.

987
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:43,290
Where are you Dave Davies.
Well I'll tell you the name of camp.

988
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:44,510
Camp Pendleton one.

989
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,250
Where's that at a West Michigan.
Is it still open.

990
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,450
Yeah. I've no idea. I don't
know why it wouldn't be.

991
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:54,680
Camps are fucking little. They're a little
like breeding grounds for criminals.

992
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,140
When I was a kid I went to
Boy Scout camp for two weeks.

993
00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:01,790
It was just a bunch of inner city kids
from Boston alone in the woods with very

994
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:04,850
little very little guides
like Lord Of The Flies.

995
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:06,190
It was dangerous man.

996
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:11,230
It was I by three days in I was there
for two weeks by three days in I realized

997
00:59:11,571 --> 00:59:15,140
like this is fucking dangerous you have
to keep your eyes open in the middle of

998
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,840
the night cause it was dark as shit and
kids were getting up in the middle of

999
00:59:17,841 --> 00:59:21,950
the night and tying kids to their beds
and then leaving them in the woods like

1000
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:23,690
Drag.
Oh leaping out.

1001
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:28,100
You know they would wake up screaming
alone in the dark like in the woods.

1002
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,700
No there's no predators or anything
in New Hampshire but it was fucking.

1003
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:35,840
No it still brings out a the
ruthlessness of youngsters.

1004
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:39,800
Yeah. So there was all these activities
I just hid and went fishing every day.

1005
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:40,930
So you were in the boys game.

1006
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:45,800
Yeah I got up in the morning and just
said fuck all your fuckin plans I'm going

1007
00:59:45,801 --> 00:59:46,290
fishing.

1008
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:49,790
You took my fishing rod and vanished and
they didn't care as long as I was back

1009
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:51,860
at the end of the day.
They even those gone.

1010
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:56,210
No one knew I did the archery things and
then I went and fished and that's it.

1011
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:01,660
I remember you know I work at the mass
ate at Outside magazine and they're

1012
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:07,931
telling me that the most letter the the
most letter generating article they ever

1013
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:12,470
ran was an article that

1014
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:17,330
was deemed to be critical of the
Boy Scouts could have been another.

1015
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:20,750
There had been a number of catastrophes
that happened to Boy Scouts that scout

1016
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:23,970
camp like look a handful
things was a lightning strike.

1017
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,020
There was a drowning incident this ma
thing is an area kind of ran this article

1018
01:00:28,021 --> 01:00:33,021
like is your kids safe at Boy Scout camp
and it really riled the organization

1019
01:00:35,211 --> 01:00:40,140
up. I think they were Tell me why be the
number one letter generating thing ever.

1020
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,080
Well they don't want to face
the reality of the situation.

1021
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:47,970
It's not 100 percent safe. If you're
going camping it's not 100 percent safe.

1022
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,690
Most likely you're going to be fine.

1023
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,730
Statistically you're
probably going to be fine.

1024
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,440
But when you've got a bunch of inner city
kids they have fuckin bows and arrows

1025
01:00:55,441 --> 01:00:56,280
and pocket knives.

1026
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:59,880
They're wandering through the woods and
there's only like three counselors there

1027
01:00:59,881 --> 01:01:02,160
was like 30 fucking kids and
three people watching us.

1028
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:03,630
There was a lot of shit going on.

1029
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,690
And you know they tried to wake the they
grabbed me in the middle of the night

1030
01:01:06,691 --> 01:01:10,500
but I woke up and I screamed and I jumped
out of bed and they let me go and then

1031
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,140
there's just a bunch of
little in your city thugs.

1032
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:18,170
And I was young I was probably like at
the time maybe twelve maybe 13 somewhere

1033
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:22,680
along but there was other kids are like
16 and 17 and they were the ones that

1034
01:01:22,681 --> 01:01:26,190
were doing shit and they were you know
they were the Eagle Scouts the older

1035
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:29,880
fucking weirdos that had done this many
times they'd they had been camp and

1036
01:01:29,881 --> 01:01:33,480
three or four years in a row and they
had like they were looking forward to it.

1037
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,470
They were never the way
they were the warlords.

1038
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:38,730
Man they covered you call
closed toothpaste toothpaste
doesn't come out of your

1039
01:01:38,731 --> 01:01:42,840
clothes try washing toothpaste out of
your fucking. Example a dribble dribble.

1040
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:47,460
I got my take I have no
vertical toothpaste when I
fucking squirted all over

1041
01:01:47,461 --> 01:01:50,520
peoples clothes and mash them together
and throw it back in you and you pull

1042
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:52,620
your clothes on the
cover with it was brutal.

1043
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,460
Just a bunch of little criminals alone in
the woods with very little supervision.

1044
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:01,820
My old man was involved was real heavily
involved in Boy Scouts for a while and

1045
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:05,610
I think he'd become an Eagle Scout
and I joined Cub Scouts as a kid.

1046
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:09,900
But the problem the way it was like my
dad was always doing such interesting

1047
01:02:09,901 --> 01:02:11,970
stuff and would take us to
do such interesting stuff.

1048
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:16,500
They'd be like you know whatever Wednesday
it was a cub scout meeting you could

1049
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:21,450
go do like nice things like if you
didn't have a dad it'd be great stuff you

1050
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:21,810
know.

1051
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:24,840
But on one hand like I could go over
and we could do like not tying this over

1052
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:28,020
that or I could go out deer hunting my
dad it's like he always like would kind

1053
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:30,870
of trump you know you could
do like the way cool stuff.

1054
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:34,890
So I never got involved in it but it
was it was great for him because he was

1055
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:38,550
born like an inner city kid
you know and didn't like that.

1056
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,770
He was born in inner city kids wanted
to somehow be out in the woods.

1057
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,560
For him it was a perfect avenue into it.

1058
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:48,590
But then for me it was like a you know
you couldn't do his cool stuff doing that

1059
01:02:48,981 --> 01:02:52,710
as I could hang out with you know my
dad and his friends my kids I never got

1060
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,020
really involved in it
when I was in high school.

1061
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,180
I don't remember the kid's name but
someone wrote a really cool article one of

1062
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:04,190
that one of the kids in my school about
a boy scouts about the problem with the

1063
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:09,330
whole the code of the Boy Scouts because
one of them was keeping your thoughts

1064
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:10,164
clean.

1065
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,680
It was all right.
Yeah I forget the exact words.

1066
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:17,130
Let's put up Boy Scout code so you get
to thinking about something that you like

1067
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:18,500
mannish and be thinking well that's.

1068
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,240
That was that.
That never works.

1069
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:23,490
This guy was the guy who wrote this.

1070
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,360
I remember reading this as I was you
know a high school student girls kind of

1071
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:28,440
got a really good fuckin point.

1072
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:31,440
The point was like What do
you give a fuck what I think.

1073
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:34,410
Like why are you trying to control my
thoughts like I'm not hurting anybody I

1074
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:38,550
might think something crazy and deviant
but I'm not doing it if as long as I'm

1075
01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:41,220
not doing it I know exactly
what's to keep my thoughts pure.

1076
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:44,790
Maybe it's fun for me to entertain
ridiculous thoughts but isn't that I know

1077
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:47,520
because that's kind of like what
self-control is. Mm hmm. Yeah.

1078
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,650
Like self-control doesn't
speak to that thought.

1079
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:55,050
The ideas you entertain self-control
speaks to like you get an email and you're

1080
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:59,440
like I'm going to write a really mean
email back and then you it's fun to

1081
01:03:59,441 --> 01:04:03,160
imagine what you're saying. I mean email.
Put it up. That's my you like read.

1082
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,670
You write a regular email and that is
like supposed to be like adult behavior.

1083
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:08,810
Exactly. Yeah. Control.

1084
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,920
Yeah well but you know some role
in controlling your actions.

1085
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,320
You see someone who's an asshole on the
car and you want to pull them out of the

1086
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:17,620
car and beat him to death but
you don't you don't do anything.

1087
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,380
You just go and you drive down really.
Yeah I would.

1088
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,900
I would pull his fingernails out.

1089
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,040
So his eyes open and throw salt on
them and make us stare at the sun.

1090
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:27,940
I never go there.

1091
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:32,650
I just go to bone breaking right away.
Snap someone's arm.

1092
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,730
They don't want to fight back.

1093
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:34,800
Yeah.

1094
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:39,610
Trustworthy loyal helpful friendly
courteous kind obedient cheerful thrifty

1095
01:04:39,611 --> 01:04:41,450
brave clean reverent.

1096
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,540
A Scout is reverent towards God He's
faithful in his religious duties he

1097
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:49,730
respects the belief of others.
Yeah. Here's the big one.

1098
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:53,770
Clean a scout keeps his
body and mind fit in clean.

1099
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,560
That was the one that this
guy had a problem with.

1100
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,720
I remember reading and going yeah the
fucking boy scouts are silly kids right

1101
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:03,960
but that's not what the
fucking scouts were.

1102
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,150
Wasn't when I when you were in.

1103
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:10,490
Well I was I went to my branch was in
Jamaica Plain which is not a very nice

1104
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:15,070
part of Boston. It's become
more gentrified now. Yeah.

1105
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:18,770
But in the early late
70s 19 I guess it was 80.

1106
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:23,760
Nineteen seventy nine or eighty when I
was in it was fucking creeps what push

1107
01:05:23,761 --> 01:05:24,594
you to get involved in it.

1108
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:27,710
What was your like. You
wanted to get out. No

1109
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:30,630
I mean I liked fishing.
I liked outdoor stuff.

1110
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,720
I was always into doing stuff from the
outdoors and I did a lot of fishing.

1111
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:36,990
I was always fishing seems like a good
avenue Yeah perceived as good avenue to

1112
01:05:36,991 --> 01:05:39,480
get out and I just thought
it'd be fun something to do.

1113
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:40,540
I'd love to be an Eagle Scout.

1114
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:42,540
Thought to be a cool thing to
be an Eagle Scout you know.

1115
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,330
But then once I got in I was cool with
the scouts until we went camping and that

1116
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:46,540
was.

1117
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,150
Get the fuck out of here
and then I was done.

1118
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,600
I got here so sad to
miss my parents so bad.

1119
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,720
Remember first time I've ever been
away for like two weeks by myself.

1120
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,400
Bunch of fucking criminals in the woods.

1121
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,730
I came home I was so happy I saw you.

1122
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,740
I can't imagine now Max got
homesick when I was a kid.

1123
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:05,580
Yeah I got the opposite of home sick now
you know I mean yeah I get homesick as

1124
01:06:05,581 --> 01:06:06,590
a kid.
Well do you find love.

1125
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:10,820
I find I travel so much that when I'm
home for a couple of weeks I'm like Okay

1126
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:13,490
ready.
Let's next.

1127
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,180
I try not to be that you know
I try not to but yeah you do.

1128
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,230
You get used to certain momentum you
know when you get home for a while.

1129
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:23,720
My wife sometimes point out that you
have been home a week and I can tell you

1130
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:24,563
you know.

1131
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,720
Why don't I.

1132
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,420
The one way I don't get that way is with
my kids like I never want to leave my

1133
01:06:30,421 --> 01:06:34,020
kids. Yeah and whenever I go
anywhere I like on vacation.

1134
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:36,690
The thing that or on a trip to work.

1135
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,690
The thing that always gets
me is I hate leaving my kids.

1136
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:44,790
You know I don't like leaving out but
my wife I'm fucking leaving her at all.

1137
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,740
I love her but I think it's good.

1138
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:50,130
I think it's good to get the fuck away
from people but just not little kids.

1139
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:54,060
But if it was just me and my wife
I'd be fucking vacation and calm.

1140
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,240
I mean how would I be working.
I'd say vacation.

1141
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:59,730
I did the long term it's going places.

1142
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:03,280
It makes me appreciate or more it
makes me appreciate my friends more to.

1143
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:03,750
Good good.

1144
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:07,080
I think there's a balance and I think
when you're around someone all the time

1145
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:10,410
you don't appreciate them as much as
when you go where you miss them and then

1146
01:07:10,411 --> 01:07:11,244
you come back.

1147
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,200
I feel that I feel that's true for me.

1148
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:19,100
Yeah I got to watch for
our sakes I can't imagine.

1149
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:22,430
I'm trying to picture my wife going to
listen it's just busy all the time you

1150
01:07:22,431 --> 01:07:22,580
know.

1151
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,160
But I never know what she might get a
free minute someone might tell her about

1152
01:07:25,161 --> 01:07:27,530
it. That's the real problem.
Yeah like a tattletale.

1153
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:30,050
When I was little bitches
she goes to the gym with I.

1154
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,140
I just want to say though I love my wife.
I love my wife.

1155
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:37,760
So if my wife listen and hear
that my favorite person ever.

1156
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:39,920
Yeah.

1157
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,750
But just like I think that you know like
there's a balance you know and part of

1158
01:07:44,751 --> 01:07:47,870
the balance is appreciating
things when you're not there.

1159
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,180
You know when you when you're
gone you appreciate them.

1160
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:50,840
You know what.

1161
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:54,020
You know my wife was annoyed with me
recently I discovered this Waylon Jennings

1162
01:07:54,021 --> 01:07:55,700
song called Freedom to stay.

1163
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:01,220
It's like this dude the narrator Waylon
begins where he's got his backpack and

1164
01:08:01,561 --> 01:08:03,150
he ties it bandanna on.

1165
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:07,320
You know and he goes as Dawn as woman
sleep and he's gonna go off and roam

1166
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:12,060
around you know and be a vagrant and
he realizes that everything he wants is

1167
01:08:12,061 --> 01:08:17,061
here and then the refrain is kind of
like you gave me the freedom to go my own

1168
01:08:17,671 --> 01:08:22,140
way which gave me the freedom to stay.
It's like she got annoyed.

1169
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:25,960
You know I keep saying it to her and
telling her how is our song you know.

1170
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:34,590
That she. She liberated me from my
desire to be a wonder. Oh that's funny.

1171
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,790
Well you know you have a very strange
life for someone to be married to you.

1172
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:42,610
I mean you're constantly gone
away hunting. Yeah I'm gone a lot.

1173
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:46,050
And you also are gone in places where
you don't get any cell phone service.

1174
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:49,320
You know you know like you're in the
fucking mountains and you know you're off

1175
01:08:49,321 --> 01:08:53,610
in the landscape you're in New Zealand
you're not in these places where you know

1176
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,490
you're gone and you come back
with this dead animal in a cooler.

1177
01:08:56,850 --> 01:09:00,120
No my life was last like
where where were you.

1178
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:04,050
Who had gone who was with you.
Did you get anything.

1179
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,260
And she usually likes
to ask after I get back.

1180
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:09,870
It's like she's the as and has
when I'm gone when I get back.

1181
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,970
She likes to know those things.

1182
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:14,610
My three old ones know what
I could powered copout.

1183
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:20,470
And if we're gonna eat it now she
doesn't want to know right. Yeah.

1184
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:25,530
Yeah I guess I have I mean I
have a very nice existence.

1185
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:31,820
You know I got to spend a lot of time
going to fantastic places and doing cool

1186
01:09:31,821 --> 01:09:32,150
stuff.

1187
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:35,360
It's a very unusual life for a hunter
that you managed to figure out how to make

1188
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:36,710
a living doing that.

1189
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,250
I mean I know I used to think I would
make a living like I thought I'd make a

1190
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:42,710
living doing that I was gonna make it.
I knew I wasn't made.

1191
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,260
I knew I wanted to make a
living hunting when I was a kid.

1192
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:47,610
I want to be a professional
hunter so I'll try.

1193
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:52,730
I'm trapped for a long time and got
sold for got really involved like really

1194
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:56,460
heavily involved in trapping and you
know took lessons and trapping rolling

1195
01:09:56,461 --> 01:09:58,080
about trapping I'll like to
be a professional trapper.

1196
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,840
The fur prices are so low when I quit
trapping those just like wasn't gonna

1197
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:06,860
happen and then I hit on this idea that
I would write about the write about that

1198
01:10:07,531 --> 01:10:11,390
kind of stuff instead. And so it's
like writing was kind of my plan B.

1199
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,140
But yeah I thought that
I would just live out.

1200
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:18,270
You know like when I was a kid I had
this dream or this fantasy that I would

1201
01:10:18,271 --> 01:10:23,250
just live out in the woods and never
talk to anybody and hunt you know.

1202
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:26,710
And I kind of like made my living like
communicating with Soulsby the thing.

1203
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:29,420
The one day I was the one thing that
wasn't in my plan was I was going to

1204
01:10:29,421 --> 01:10:33,600
communicate well that's really funny
because you're good at it you know and the

1205
01:10:33,601 --> 01:10:38,601
fact that the writing is there was sort
of you know it came about in order to

1206
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,820
make it so that you can
make a living hunting.

1207
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,400
Know you're a really good writer
man mediators a great book.

1208
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:46,700
Yeah I enjoy what I enjoy it.

1209
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:51,740
I remember when I was in 10th grade I
just English teacher Mr. Heaton and I had

1210
01:10:52,051 --> 01:10:57,020
written an essay I'd written
like a comparison contrast
paper about Melville and

1211
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:57,630
Falconer.

1212
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:02,190
So I came here what and for the English
class and he's gonna submit your essay

1213
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:06,100
to a writing contest. And I forbade
him from doing. I can't imagine why.

1214
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:10,170
I told my I was gonna do that I don't
want to be in the contest presented

1215
01:11:10,171 --> 01:11:11,520
anyways and I won second place.

1216
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:14,430
When I got this letter that I had to go
this awards ceremony it mentioned a cash

1217
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:18,570
prize super excited I suppose
you 250 bucks or something.

1218
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:23,480
We go down there and the gal that won
the event was at this place called the

1219
01:11:23,481 --> 01:11:25,370
frozen ball center in Muskegon Michigan.

1220
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:30,430
The gal at 1 goes up and gets a check and
then I go and they give me a thesaurus

1221
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:36,700
and I was just like bombed I thought I
got 250 bucks and I was like visibly bomb

1222
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:42,500
Mr heating had come to the awards ceremony
with me and he said he said something

1223
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:43,640
I'll never forget.

1224
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:48,640
He's like You know there's far more
than 250 dollars worth of words in that

1225
01:11:49,521 --> 01:11:50,354
book.

1226
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:55,590
Yeah that was kind of my genesis as a
writer was the idea that the book is worth

1227
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:58,610
250 but no he meant like
that if you can capture.

1228
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:01,910
No no not his point I mean like you
thought you were going to get 250 bucks.

1229
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:04,840
No they just change their
budget wasn't what it was.

1230
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,590
I mean I never had a satisfactory answers
the wide and get to him 50 bucks but I

1231
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:13,140
went there wanting my check and come out
of this book. I slammed the thesaurus.

1232
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:18,240
You know do you really. Yeah that's
fine. Now keep in mind box like specials.

1233
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,480
How did you wind up doing the wild within.

1234
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,020
That was that was how
I found out about you.

1235
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,460
You were on a show on the trial channel
it was called the wild within it was an

1236
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:26,370
interesting show.

1237
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:31,390
The first episode I ever watched you
were going to take the same route that

1238
01:12:31,731 --> 01:12:35,650
Lewis and Clark took and you shot a moose
and turned it into a boat made a bobo

1239
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:38,660
out of a Buffalo Buffalo.
That's what it was. Yeah.

1240
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:40,280
You shot it with a musket too right.

1241
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,700
I mean you want like the show business
story about how I did but what made you

1242
01:12:43,701 --> 01:12:45,430
decide to be on TV like we did.

1243
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:50,870
I would periodically like as a writer
I would periodically get called by

1244
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:56,530
producers and developers about stuff I
had written or they would kind of summon

1245
01:12:56,611 --> 01:13:01,110
you you know like you might get a phone
call or you get an email and then a

1246
01:13:01,111 --> 01:13:04,590
phone call an email through a magazine
or whatever and realize that some guy at

1247
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:09,420
History Channel wants you to come down
and and what they do is they're desk

1248
01:13:09,421 --> 01:13:14,290
bound individuals and they're obligated
to go into these meetings you know and

1249
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:15,490
have like some ideas.

1250
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,240
And so when they're putting together their
portfolio of ideas they would like to

1251
01:13:19,241 --> 01:13:22,330
go contact writers or people who are
out doing interesting stuff in the

1252
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:26,990
hinterlands you know and come in kind
of report about what's exciting at the

1253
01:13:26,991 --> 01:13:27,380
time.

1254
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:31,010
And I'd gone to a number of these meetings
over the years about stories I had

1255
01:13:31,011 --> 01:13:33,530
written and every time you get
the e-mail you're like Oh my God.

1256
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,160
Be on TV and it would never work out.

1257
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:40,210
But eventually I signed a development
agreement after I wrote my first book

1258
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:47,800
scavengers God or cuisine which I just
got the rights back to the book sells

1259
01:13:47,801 --> 01:13:51,270
like there's so few those books out there
that they sell on Amazon for like 130

1260
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:51,820
bucks.

1261
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:52,330
Really.

1262
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:57,330
And I just they just like Miramax The
Weinstein Company just gave me my rights

1263
01:13:57,981 --> 01:14:02,690
back. Wow. In a move that would
benefit them in no way whatsoever.

1264
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:05,360
Just like out of the goodness of their
hearts like gave me the rights to my book

1265
01:14:05,361 --> 01:14:06,580
back.
Why they do that.

1266
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,380
Like know lonely as much as people like
to talk about Harvey Weinstein being

1267
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:13,460
like the worst guy on the planet.

1268
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:17,750
I don't know that I know that his
companies gave me my books rights back.

1269
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:19,910
I didn't even try to get money
out of me just gave him to me.

1270
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,910
I've never heard of the worst guy on
the planet people telling you horror

1271
01:14:22,911 --> 01:14:26,760
stories. You know I've never heard any
horror stories. But I don't have any.

1272
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:31,670
Here's a great book or a great documentary
detailing a horror story that he

1273
01:14:31,671 --> 01:14:34,520
dealt with. Those are right.
Yeah it's called overnight.

1274
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:38,050
Oh if you see that's a great movie.
Yeah.

1275
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,950
And that guy was to blame and that thing.

1276
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:45,100
But yeah yeah that guy like the cover
of it is him hold the camera to his head

1277
01:14:45,141 --> 01:14:46,910
like that.
That's a phenomenal movie.

1278
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,170
If he fucks it on now if you haven't
seen it it's about the producer writer

1279
01:14:51,171 --> 01:14:56,080
whatever of said fuck and shoot him out
scenes. Yeah. Boondock Saints. Yeah.

1280
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,520
Terrible FUCKIN MOVIE BY THE WAY. DON'T
YOU DARE TELL ME THAT'S GOOD. NO I WON'T.

1281
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,413
BUT NOT YOU.

1282
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:04,760
I mean whoever you are out there
you fucking freaks like that.

1283
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,140
People have told me that's good.

1284
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,470
And I watch nose like I made it 20
minutes and I was like this is a piece of

1285
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:12,200
shit. Terrible movie.
I didn't know anything.

1286
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:13,730
I watched it after the documentary.

1287
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:17,850
I was like I watch I my I go see this
movie but it only validates that you know

1288
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:18,913
validates the movie.

1289
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:22,730
Yeah well do you know what it came
out of it came out of Pulp Fiction.

1290
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:23,450
There's that.

1291
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:28,250
Yes this whole breed of this genre
that came out of Pulp Fiction.

1292
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:33,730
But what they don't have sent Pulp
Fiction is a fucking genius movie from a

1293
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:35,660
genius movie maker.

1294
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:40,090
I mean Quentin Tarantino is a bad mother
fucker do when I want to see that movie

1295
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:45,100
it felt like like like like something
came down from the heavens and touched my

1296
01:15:46,371 --> 01:15:46,820
forehead.

1297
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:49,330
I had never seen him like I didn't
know anything about like cool.

1298
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:55,150
I was blown away but it's so complex and
there's so many layers to the timeline

1299
01:15:55,761 --> 01:16:00,761
switched around and meets it's a genius
work of film and then this fucking dummy

1300
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,030
came along and decided to make this shoot
him up and there's gonna be why fuck

1301
01:16:05,031 --> 01:16:08,370
you fuckin fuck and fuck
fuck fuck and bang bang bang.

1302
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:13,720
And it's just it's an assault on your
intelligence it's shit and I just thought

1303
01:16:13,761 --> 01:16:16,850
it was a piece of shit and then I watched
this documentary on the guy who made

1304
01:16:16,851 --> 01:16:21,590
it was like Oh and being it's a great
job I don't know anything about the guy

1305
01:16:21,591 --> 01:16:23,420
that made that movie It's
a great job and a movie.

1306
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:27,430
Yeah well I mean the people who made it
look the guy whoever made overnight like

1307
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:31,190
a phenomenal job with the guys who made
it were the guys who were involved with

1308
01:16:31,191 --> 01:16:36,191
him in the beginning yeah
they were documenting this
this rise to fame they were

1309
01:16:36,621 --> 01:16:40,670
supposed to be documenting this guy who
worked at a bar Harvey Weinstein signed

1310
01:16:40,671 --> 01:16:44,390
him to this gigantic deal and buys
the bar and they're gonna own the bar

1311
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,270
together and make giant movies together
they just were convinced this guy was

1312
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:51,560
brilliant and meanwhile he's like saying
Alec anti-Semitic stuff and he's just

1313
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:56,650
ego that the documentary is about ego
and if if you're a person who's like you

1314
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:02,570
planning on any sort of a career in
show business I think it's a must watch

1315
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:06,950
because I've seen those people I've never
met him but I've seen a hundred guys

1316
01:17:06,951 --> 01:17:08,390
like him that didn't make it.

1317
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:11,570
I've met a hundred of those guys they
were convinced that they're the baddest

1318
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:13,390
motherfuckers it's fucking towns.

1319
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:16,700
Never seen anybody like us before
we're gonna fucking run this town.

1320
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:21,890
I've met those guys I've met so many of
them and acting and the film business

1321
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:26,980
breeds them it somehow or another the
idea of acting first of all is responsible

1322
01:17:27,561 --> 01:17:32,561
for a lot of disproportionate egos egos
that are not based on anything realistic

1323
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:39,500
they're based on your ability to pretend
and then not even based on you being

1324
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:42,980
really good at pretending sometimes
but you being famous for pretending and

1325
01:17:42,981 --> 01:17:46,310
these people just because the camera's
on them and the people pay attention them

1326
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:51,410
have these enormous insane egos
I've seen it on sitcoms sets.

1327
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:56,440
I've seen it in movies I've seen the
actors I've seen and the madness like the

1328
01:17:57,051 --> 01:18:02,051
reality of of life escapes them they they
they are insulated from it completely

1329
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:09,370
and they live in this world where the
camera's on them and there they have this

1330
01:18:09,621 --> 01:18:13,220
idea that because the camera's on them
they must be special so because they're

1331
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:17,510
special. But there is no ego check
there's no answer then you know to get.

1332
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:23,140
OK like to put it in the honey
terms like say please say it's OK.

1333
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:29,500
If you're gonna go after a very difficult
animal to track OK I'll say if you're

1334
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:34,541
gonna go after Himalayan tar yeah OK
you're gonna fucking climb through the

1335
01:18:35,481 --> 01:18:39,830
mountains it's an incredibly difficult
task it takes a long time to get there

1336
01:18:39,831 --> 01:18:44,090
you might not see one for days when you
finally do see one sheet like this mule

1337
01:18:44,091 --> 01:18:48,590
deer that the skull that's unstable is
perfect example you and I hiked around

1338
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:53,050
for days we walked seven hours we
worked our asses off and it's a haul.

1339
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:57,410
So when that thing actually
when I actually shot it
and it dropped and then we

1340
01:18:57,411 --> 01:19:01,460
brought it back it was like wow
like we did it we did something.

1341
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:05,810
Whereas if if that thing was in a pen
okay and I walked up and shot it in the

1342
01:19:05,811 --> 01:19:09,140
face I would have zero
feeling of accomplishment.

1343
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,990
Well acting is a lot like
shooting an animal in the face.

1344
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:16,280
It's a lot like shooting a penned up
animal in the face like you're not really

1345
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:19,420
some Special person you're
just someone who's crazy.

1346
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:23,010
So you're good at pretending because
you don't really have a self identity or

1347
01:19:23,011 --> 01:19:27,560
your self identity community be
manipulated in you know or you're your

1348
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:29,830
personality can manipulate it in a role.

1349
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:32,750
This is what you're saying has
validity because you do it you act.

1350
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:37,700
I have I have acted I avoid it for
that very raw because I feel like those

1351
01:19:37,701 --> 01:19:42,701
people are sick I feel like there's
something about that occupation where you

1352
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:47,120
pretend to be like you know many people
I've met that like they play tough guys

1353
01:19:47,121 --> 01:19:51,860
in movies so they think they're tough
they're fucking crazy I've met so many of

1354
01:19:51,861 --> 01:19:56,861
them it's it's a sick way to make a living
it's it's some people pull it off and

1355
01:19:58,221 --> 01:20:02,870
they become really sensitive people
like Henry Winkler The Fonz Yeah.

1356
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,940
One of the nicest fucking guys I ever met.

1357
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,670
I'll tell you I haven't heard that
I've heard from multiple people.

1358
01:20:07,730 --> 01:20:09,350
He's a sweetheart fly fisherman.

1359
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:12,200
No I've heard that from old
people wrote a book about it.

1360
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:14,500
I've never met an idiot on the river his.

1361
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:18,020
Yeah yeah I've not heard of it and I've
heard from older people what it was like.

1362
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:22,130
It looks like how surprised people are
what a great guy you talk to him you

1363
01:20:22,131 --> 01:20:23,480
would have known he played a tough guy.

1364
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:27,920
Yeah he could turn on and turn off
electric appliances by punching the wall.

1365
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:31,910
Please don't go to your high too which
is really what I mean I'm a short guy and

1366
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:33,720
he's tiny me it's weird.

1367
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,340
You know like this guy was like
this tough guy on this show.

1368
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:38,000
How did that ever work.
Yeah.

1369
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:42,350
He would walk into a bathroom and bang
the wall and run out of the bathroom and

1370
01:20:42,351 --> 01:20:46,240
he would talk. He tells
Cordero and they're good at
it. He's good at it too man.

1371
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:47,520
But you know I've met.

1372
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:50,270
I mean my point is I've met
a lot of really nice actors.

1373
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:55,300
It's not a broad sweeping generalization
but I think that the occupation itself

1374
01:20:56,270 --> 01:21:01,270
is it's so unchecked like up
Tommy Francis is very checked.

1375
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,910
Like if you're a funny comedian the
you the reason why you're funny. Yeah.

1376
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:08,360
You have to write the meat.
You have to write the comedy.

1377
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:13,190
You have to perform it. You
bomb you reassess. You go
back to the drawing board.

1378
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:14,480
You have to figure out how to do it.

1379
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:18,860
Once you actually get to doing it
there's a certain amount of humility like

1380
01:21:18,861 --> 01:21:22,400
after ten years of doing that
almost all comedians possess.

1381
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:26,120
When you talk to them about comedy even
if they're really good at they'll never

1382
01:21:26,121 --> 01:21:29,900
tell you like I'm I'm a bad motherfucker
I'm the baddest motherfucker that ever

1383
01:21:29,901 --> 01:21:30,734
got on stage.

1384
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:33,620
They know you live a flop
in such an immediate way.

1385
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,830
MAN Yeah you die you fucking
you eat shit up there.

1386
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:39,410
It happens so often you crushes your ego.

1387
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:41,750
I get the badge you guys like.
You just watch you go ahead.

1388
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:44,450
It's like a movie like you make it there's
all this excitement stuff and later

1389
01:21:44,451 --> 01:21:46,880
it doesn't do well. You're like up
there going like this is not going well.

1390
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,080
Well I never done it.

1391
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:51,720
I could just imagine how humiliating Am
I the way I described is like sucking a

1392
01:21:51,721 --> 01:21:52,970
thousand dicks in front of your mother.

1393
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,850
It's actually probably worse than that
because it's somewhere out there that

1394
01:21:57,851 --> 01:22:00,470
someone that would like to suck a
thousand dicks in front of his mother.

1395
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:04,660
Nobody wants to bomb on stage.
Now just a horrible crushing him.

1396
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,870
But along the way one of the things you
learn is to be really good at comedy.

1397
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:13,210
You you you have to lose all of
your sense of self-importance.

1398
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:18,430
You have to lose all of that pretending
you're something special like you're not

1399
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:19,910
something but you're just a person.

1400
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:23,330
And the best way to do comedy
is almost to be non-existent.

1401
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:28,630
Like you you're you when you write and
when you perform there's almost no you in

1402
01:22:29,421 --> 01:22:33,200
there unless it's a self-deprecating
aspect of it like you're you're pointing

1403
01:22:33,201 --> 01:22:36,740
out things that are silly about you or
pointing out ridiculous ideas he might

1404
01:22:36,741 --> 01:22:39,650
have had in your head at one point in
time but other than that like when you're

1405
01:22:39,651 --> 01:22:42,350
performing you're never thinking man.
I'm up here and I'm killing.

1406
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:46,910
You don't think of that at all like in
fact you're almost like a passenger in

1407
01:22:46,911 --> 01:22:49,040
this weird ride that you've put together.

1408
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:53,300
Yeah I go and you all you know is that
you kind of know how to do it and all you

1409
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:56,120
know is that you kind of have to keep
at it in order to continue do it.

1410
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,680
And it's really fun to do.

1411
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:02,980
But the moment you start taking it serious
or tripping in it all of the success

1412
01:23:03,661 --> 01:23:08,661
of it to you being super special and
amazing and unique you fucking suck.

1413
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:13,290
But where did your comedy suffers.
Oh it goes terribly wrong. Yeah.

1414
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:15,560
Because people know that they
don't want to laugh at you.

1415
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:19,790
Part of laughing at you is like you have
to belong in the moment of what you're

1416
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:22,630
doing and if you're in the moment of what
you're doing the last thing you gonna

1417
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,320
be thinking about is how awesome you are.

1418
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:29,180
Like that doesn't come up whereas an
actor like you can pretend that there's

1419
01:23:29,181 --> 01:23:31,160
something really special about you.

1420
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:35,570
Like when that ready action and then you
do this role and you you play this guy

1421
01:23:35,571 --> 01:23:37,190
it's all pretend it's all bullshit.

1422
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:42,400
So there's the checking aspect to being
the ego check and the creative process

1423
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:45,530
the tuning in that does is nonexistent.

1424
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,230
We were treated probably around you.

1425
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:49,710
You treat with a certain
amount of deference to that
you're not going to get us

1426
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:50,390
doing standup.

1427
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:53,090
Exactly. They're treated like
we were treated like shit.

1428
01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:56,210
The commune is a way you know people like
you if you're good and they appreciate

1429
01:23:56,211 --> 01:23:58,910
that. But no one like takes
it seriously as an art form.

1430
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:03,380
Yeah it's one of the reasons
why plagiarism was so he's
so a huge problem with

1431
01:24:03,381 --> 01:24:08,300
comedy whereas it was treated with you
know if you think about plagiarism in

1432
01:24:08,301 --> 01:24:12,110
literature there's lawsuits and people's
careers are really like you'll you'll

1433
01:24:12,111 --> 01:24:15,350
be disrespected.
Music massive lawsuits.

1434
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:18,800
I mean people have lost millions of
dollars just for a riff like one of my

1435
01:24:18,801 --> 01:24:22,550
favorite examples is there's a great
song by the verb Bittersweet Symphony

1436
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:26,450
idealism but that riff is
stolen from the Rolling Stones.

1437
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:30,330
So because of that those guys made
nothing. They didn't make anything. No.

1438
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,940
Yeah they had to give it all away.

1439
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:36,020
I still like that sounds great song but
the lyrics are great it's interesting

1440
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:39,190
but there's no doubt about it.
That riff comes from the Rolling Stones.

1441
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:44,130
Stones to remember oh you
know you know this little bit.

1442
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:47,460
I think maybe you forgot. I'm going to
see you on January 30 first. Oh yeah yeah.

1443
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:49,970
Oh cool. Is that sold out. Yes
we talk about yeah. Not sold out.

1444
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,680
It's been sold out for months
the last time. What is it.
The last time. The rings.

1445
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:54,950
That's those are the last time.

1446
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:59,700
Yeah I will. After I saw you last time
when I went to see you in New Jersey.

1447
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:05,480
We were driving home my wife was
saying to me she's like my face hurts.

1448
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:11,560
From laughing at heart and I want to write
a thing I want read a thing like that.

1449
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:16,160
I want to envision writing
something called like the
only happy comedian because

1450
01:25:16,161 --> 01:25:21,161
he's like I don't understand comedy at
all but you got to think you come at it

1451
01:25:21,651 --> 01:25:23,740
from a position of strength
in some way you'd like it.

1452
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:27,080
Like so much stuff is funny because
it's like from a place of self-loathing.

1453
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,630
Like so many comedians do like a
self-loathing thing and I to be real.

1454
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:33,980
It's like it's kind of like they're
just where it spawns from is like

1455
01:25:33,981 --> 01:25:36,040
self-hatred.
And I'm so pathetic you know.

1456
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:40,150
I mean it was like fire that you build a
whole act bill whole act and like come.

1457
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:43,890
Like you're at a position of strength.
I'll have you ever think of it that way.

1458
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:47,510
But like you're up there like you seem
like when you're up there you seem

1459
01:25:47,511 --> 01:25:52,340
somehow like in control and you know
like a word you like in control and

1460
01:25:52,341 --> 01:25:53,720
powerful but still funny.

1461
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:56,660
It's a weird contradiction because we
get from stand up we get to thinking like

1462
01:25:56,661 --> 01:26:01,570
it's just like Yeah my wife don't like me.
No one likes me I'm awful.

1463
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:02,550
I can't do anything.

1464
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:08,660
Well people have always said that you
know you have to be nebbish she or fat or

1465
01:26:08,661 --> 01:26:10,090
weird to be a comedian guy.

1466
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:14,060
I was so I was told that so much
that I was insecure about my body.

1467
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:16,430
When I first started doing comedy
that's kind of what I'm saying.

1468
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:20,030
They could be like No I'm fine. Yeah.
Like if I wasn't doing this I'd be fine.

1469
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,770
We could be doing something else.

1470
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:26,450
The thing about comedy is that
there's no rules. There's no rules.

1471
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:30,080
I mean there's there's sort of
laws to it but there's no rules.

1472
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:34,670
You know there's there's laws and some
of the laws are that it has to be funny

1473
01:26:34,671 --> 01:26:38,690
to you and that you you have to learn
it and that everybody's different.

1474
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:42,820
Like there's Mitch Hedberg who is like
you familiar Mitch Oh yeah I mean I've

1475
01:26:42,821 --> 01:26:43,430
got a good match.

1476
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:45,840
I've got a good match
that works really well.

1477
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:49,280
We'll get in that one of
my all time favorites but
there's also Sam Kennison two

1478
01:26:49,281 --> 01:26:52,220
completely different styles of comedy
to my all time favorite comedians.

1479
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:57,790
There's it's all based on what is the
world through your eyes and what what I

1480
01:26:58,071 --> 01:26:58,904
find funny.

1481
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:03,200
It's funny coming out of me it's
coming out of my mouth my mind.

1482
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:08,230
But if you gave my act to Demetri Martin
I probably be Bill put off you know the

1483
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:12,980
more violent physical aggressive
aspects of my act. It wouldn't work.

1484
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:16,230
You know it works because it's funny to
me. It's obviously funny to me. Yeah.

1485
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:17,203
And I'm being honest.

1486
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:20,930
Like when when I talk about the things
that I think are funny it's because I've

1487
01:27:20,931 --> 01:27:24,020
thought about it. I've this is these
are things that I honestly find amusing.

1488
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:24,870
I'm not lying.

1489
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:27,980
So you don't sit around and think like
what would be something funny I could say

1490
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:30,530
never.
What I did is jumps in your head.

1491
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,750
Yeah I mean like I will convert
this now into my comedy.

1492
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:34,700
Well I've it's taken a long time.

1493
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:39,500
I see the stages of comedy the first
stage is you're absolutely terrified and

1494
01:27:39,501 --> 01:27:42,440
all you're trying to do is get a laugh
in any way shape or form and I think of

1495
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:46,940
jokes in that stage as tools.
All you're trying to do is get by.

1496
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:49,880
You do like usually in the beginning
like when you're an open mike comedian

1497
01:27:49,881 --> 01:27:53,090
you've got five minutes on stage and
those five minutes are fucking harrowing

1498
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:58,460
ride through hell. And when it's over
like who I got a couple laughs. All right.

1499
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:00,470
You know I didn't I didn't die.

1500
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:03,440
And then occasionally you will die
and then you think about quitting.

1501
01:28:03,470 --> 01:28:06,290
And many many times I thought
about quitting was like
Fuck that I can't do this

1502
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:10,240
anymore is to Davis you can't handle
getting beat up like that you're an easy

1503
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:15,060
the the punishment that your self-esteem
takes when you bomb on stage is all

1504
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,590
almost overwhelming.

1505
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:20,140
Like for it for some people I've
seen guys bomb and never recover.

1506
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:24,010
I've seen them like their act diminishes
like they had some potential there's

1507
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:28,760
something there and then I seen like one
night where the fuckin wheels come off

1508
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,650
and then they never they never recover.

1509
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,930
It's almost like a beating
that a fighter takes.

1510
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:37,370
I've seen fighters take beatings and not
even just the physical punishment of it

1511
01:28:37,371 --> 01:28:42,371
but the confidence destruction of it
yeah just they they're never the same guy

1512
01:28:43,131 --> 01:28:46,370
again they never become that
carefree cocky guy again.

1513
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,510
It just goes away you know.

1514
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:51,200
And with that so does their
fighting career I've seen
that happen with comedians

1515
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:54,380
as well.
So the beginning is just tools.

1516
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:58,680
And then once you do that then
somewhere along the line you go okay.

1517
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:01,520
I'm pretty confident that I have some
tools. Now what do I think it's funny.

1518
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:03,530
What would I laugh at.
This is what's funny to me.

1519
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:05,450
And then we come up with
stuff that's funny to you.

1520
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:10,720
And then there's a stage
three that comedians may or
may not ever even get into.

1521
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:16,140
And that is how do you make your
ideas funny ideas like philosophy.

1522
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:19,430
Like how do you have a point of view and
figure out a way to impart that point

1523
01:29:19,431 --> 01:29:20,140
of view on people.

1524
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:25,140
Like for me this a thing I'm doing and
just so just so I'm clear when you talk

1525
01:29:25,551 --> 01:29:28,460
about you talk about moving
away from just like jokes. Yes.

1526
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:29,840
Like what does this do.

1527
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:34,930
It's this like taking like a like a
philosophy's or trying to figure out a way

1528
01:29:36,411 --> 01:29:41,240
to get an idea in to turn that idea
into comedy trying to maybe maybe a

1529
01:29:41,241 --> 01:29:45,110
controversial idea maybe an idea that
you think is important maybe maybe just a

1530
01:29:45,111 --> 01:29:49,070
thought because there's a way to
introduce an idea into someone's brain.

1531
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,640
Give me an example of an idea.
Well can you pull.

1532
01:29:51,710 --> 01:29:54,560
I mean can you throw one else
hard to do this what is it to say.

1533
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:58,880
Like say like if you go on stage and say
Say if you're a Republican and you're

1534
01:29:58,881 --> 01:30:03,881
on stage and you start going off about
you know gay marriage or this or that you

1535
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:05,600
know you just give a speech.

1536
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:10,290
Yeah if I'm in the audience and I have
an opposing point of view I go I'll fuck

1537
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:13,000
you I don't like your
opinion I think that's wrong.

1538
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:14,310
And I think people should
be able to do this.

1539
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:18,960
But if you go on stage and say something
that makes me laugh yeah even if I

1540
01:30:18,961 --> 01:30:22,650
don't agree with you even though I don't
agree with if you make me laugh I have

1541
01:30:22,651 --> 01:30:24,150
to at least consider your idea.

1542
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:28,890
I have to at least you've you've
introduced like here's a prime example.

1543
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:32,640
I had a guy who came up to me who is a
Christian and I say do this bit about

1544
01:30:32,641 --> 01:30:36,690
Noah's ark that if you told no one in
the Ark to an eight year old retarded boy

1545
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:38,070
he's gonna have some questions.

1546
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:42,540
So I had this whole bit about you know
someone sitting down with this young

1547
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:45,670
retarded boy telling them the
story of Noah's Ark. Yeah yeah.

1548
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,800
And it's this it was a really long bet.

1549
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:50,080
It was like and this
guy came out to mangle.

1550
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,800
I got to tell you man
look I'm a Christian.

1551
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:56,970
And you started talking about Noah's
Ark and I started getting offended.

1552
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,240
And he goes but two or three
minutes into that fucking bed.

1553
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:03,600
I was laughing so goddamn hard I
started thinking What the fuck.

1554
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:05,310
How is that a real story.

1555
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:08,280
And he started laugh and he goes I just
wanna say congratulations you made me

1556
01:31:08,281 --> 01:31:10,670
laugh at something that's completely
opposed to my own beliefs.

1557
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:16,280
This is this is a video where a guy came
up to me after a show in Georgia here

1558
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:19,170
play this is because it is kind of funny.

1559
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:24,520
You know this guy told me he found Noah's
Ark on a mountain archaeology sites

1560
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,130
and look for a documented.

1561
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:29,340
Battle.
You know check it out and say OK.

1562
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:34,350
And we actually fund expeditions to back
up where somebody claims I'm going to

1563
01:31:34,351 --> 01:31:37,250
tell you.
That the shots I'll show you.

1564
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,810
What kind of blow your mind but our
job is not to say what it is right.

1565
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:43,910
Our job is just confirm what they face.

1566
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,670
So I think you say maybe they believe you.
I'm confused though.

1567
01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:53,210
You really believe that Noah's Ark. Well
let me let me take. Well. Let me tell you.

1568
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:53,970
When.

1569
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:58,970
We first of all they did find a boat
shaped object in the mountains of Ararat

1570
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,810
that's five hundred fifteen feet long.

1571
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:03,730
That should be enough for all the animals.
Nothing or.

1572
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:06,780
Something about a hundred million
species that seems we're gonna.

1573
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:10,610
Well I don't know. OK. It's about
five as long as I need to hit us off.

1574
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,850
Yeah can you even get the 500 foot thing.

1575
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:18,270
Anyway if you suck shots.
How many.

1576
01:32:18,990 --> 01:32:20,310
Just the things were found.

1577
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:23,300
It's a cool thing at the very least
you might be able to use a moment.

1578
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:26,320
Isn't it possible that maybe
it's just a hoax. Yeah.

1579
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:30,330
Well why would anybody assume
that that boat wouldn't pick.

1580
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:35,040
Any there would be any connection in
history to a crazy story to do to get all

1581
01:32:35,041 --> 01:32:38,700
the animals to come on his boat against
God talked to told us that the rain was

1582
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:41,130
going to drown everybody because
everybody wasn't paying attention.

1583
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:43,910
We this thing we're all like that.

1584
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,710
He makes out all but how could that
be Noah's Ark case. Well I don't know.

1585
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:51,000
You don't actually you don't
actually have wood there anymore.

1586
01:32:51,050 --> 01:32:52,060
Whatever it is is great.

1587
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:55,800
It's about even if it was a solid
boat it still seems the only thing.

1588
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:59,030
Unless you're like a carnival
ship right next to Rhino ship.

1589
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:02,870
Well I said glad you said we didn't
have samples. Yeah camel shakes.

1590
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:07,940
We've taken core samples found
different species of animals remains.

1591
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:10,590
We've got twelve.
No they didn't.

1592
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:15,010
We've got twelve anchors again should
be about enough for a home away.

1593
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:18,390
Isn't in the way of animals. It was
probably more than that of about twelve.

1594
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:23,190
What do you do when you find this on
a six thousand foot peak in the hills.

1595
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:26,850
But at the very least I could just show
you what they are without a doubt this

1596
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:29,310
earth is over the last.

1597
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:33,570
Thousands of thousand years gouges and
pretty capped huge cataclysmic events.

1598
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:37,920
You mean they know for a fact that at
one point in time where Montana is right

1599
01:33:37,921 --> 01:33:42,680
now that's where all the Megalodon find
megafauna fossils that gigantic shark is

1600
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:47,100
juicy. They find them in the
mountain amounts of Montana
which that's six million

1601
01:33:47,101 --> 01:33:47,670
years.

1602
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:51,600
So they know that no matter what there's
some crazy shit happen to this planet.

1603
01:33:52,050 --> 01:33:52,620
Without a doubt.

1604
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:56,010
So it's very conceivable that at one
point in time it was a huge flood in that

1605
01:33:56,011 --> 01:33:57,960
region.
And that's why there's a stack up there.

1606
01:33:58,230 --> 01:33:59,910
It's very possible it is pretty possible.

1607
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:04,010
But but I can't confirm
we do have something that
matches dead and that's what

1608
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:04,863
story is.

1609
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:07,130
Well I love that I use that term.

1610
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:10,500
No do have good Gilgamesh
is the original one.

1611
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:14,010
Yeah it's one of the oldest ones that we
know. But it's it's a cool coincidence.

1612
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:15,380
Yeah well I think.

1613
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:19,440
I think what the story of Noah's Ark is
where it really is all about is that at

1614
01:34:19,441 --> 01:34:23,100
one point in time I think there was a
huge disaster and it's probably happened

1615
01:34:23,101 --> 01:34:27,360
more than once where like meteors hit
or you know what's in the polar ice caps

1616
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:28,350
or something huge.

1617
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:32,500
Fortunately he kills like 90 percent of
people at the level that are remaining.

1618
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:33,353
They have a story.

1619
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:37,470
Story of a great disaster and some people
got away and those stories the story

1620
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:41,130
of the great disaster and some person got
away over time that person becomes the

1621
01:34:41,131 --> 01:34:42,330
great hero of the Savior.

1622
01:34:42,570 --> 01:34:45,900
They talk about around the
campfire and is and legend grows.

1623
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:49,200
And when you have a story that's told
in oral tradition for over a thousand

1624
01:34:49,201 --> 01:34:50,590
years it's everywhere in nature Hebrew.

1625
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:53,730
And to this day they only know
three or four words ancient Hebrew.

1626
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,880
To this day 25 percent all the words are
told they have no idea what it means.

1627
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:00,870
And in ancient Hebrew there
was no numbers. So letters
also double its numbers.

1628
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:04,770
So you lose all the numeric value that's
important the text like the word God

1629
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,800
and the word love.
They have the same numeric value.

1630
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,220
And that's very important for sentencing.

1631
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:12,320
And when I was translated into Latin
translated The Greek they lost all of that

1632
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:15,890
shit and that's all these stories that
are distorted thousands years of people

1633
01:35:15,891 --> 01:35:20,891
bullshitting around a campfire to the
original tax being indecipherable to what

1634
01:35:21,381 --> 01:35:26,150
they have today. How can anybody think
that's real. You would have. To be.

1635
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:27,463
Fucking.

1636
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:32,240
Crazy to think that that really happened
to God talk to one guy and got all the

1637
01:35:32,241 --> 01:35:36,110
animals from all over the world and put
him on a boat that it makes zero sense

1638
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:38,680
when you know people are liars
you know people are weak.

1639
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:41,580
You know even most religious
people are completely full of shit.

1640
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,670
And if after all that you think that
that storage room that's insane.

1641
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:49,300
When you actually see the evidence about.

1642
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:58,420
Well that guy obviously didn't listen or
you know that the ideas didn't get into

1643
01:35:58,681 --> 01:36:00,200
his head but you can't.

1644
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:03,330
But he was so kind about it kind.

1645
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:07,740
He never threatened you. He didn't want
to kill you or anything. Well I can't.

1646
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,120
Well I don't think he was religious.

1647
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,880
He was a documentarians All right.

1648
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:14,230
I believed that he had
found Noah's Ark Yeah.

1649
01:36:14,410 --> 01:36:16,720
There was probably not the
best one thing but when he.

1650
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:19,580
But one thing the bones.

1651
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:23,080
They can't. They better not be there.
Fine. Because they only had two of each.

1652
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,140
So they died.

1653
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:27,070
Well that could've been the unicorns
bone. Yeah. If that's true right.

1654
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:31,070
If they died then what the fuck.
Unless they bred before they died.

1655
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:35,390
That could have been the longtime.
I'll tell you one thing though.

1656
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,050
You're kind of getting at this like the
way the guy came up to you and he said

1657
01:36:39,051 --> 01:36:41,360
like you were offending
me but I was funny.

1658
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:45,350
I think I struggle with like you talked
to really liberal people and you like

1659
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:48,190
Rush. You know Rush Limbaugh
is funny sometimes it's funny.

1660
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:50,270
It's that makes him so mad.

1661
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,780
We I really conservative would be like
you know Jon Stewart is so you can be

1662
01:36:53,781 --> 01:36:55,820
pretty funny get mad
they get real mad at you.

1663
01:36:56,070 --> 01:36:59,930
They can't imagine I'm ever like when you
were doing part of your act or talking

1664
01:36:59,931 --> 01:37:02,500
about when people get really mad at
comedians for saying some of the comedy

1665
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:06,200
years. And you kind of you mentioned like
how come no one's mad at Johnny Cash.

1666
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:10,100
You're shooting a man just to watch
him die. It didn't really happen.

1667
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:12,470
Yeah that's a big that's
the important thing.

1668
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:15,830
Johnny Cash didn't really shoot a man
in Reno. That didn't really happen.

1669
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:16,933
This is cop.

1670
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,750
Well that's the thing about comedy is
it's an easy target and for people that

1671
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:24,020
are looking to be offended which is like
a lot of bloggers and people looking to

1672
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:28,730
find something to be outraged about
they'll they'll point to comedy because

1673
01:37:28,731 --> 01:37:32,280
comedy is a soft target. You know a
lot of comedians will say fuck that.

1674
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,350
There's an art form.
No

1675
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:34,820
one's always wanted to kill novelists.

1676
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:36,860
Now let's use Solomon
Rushdie a long time ago.

1677
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:39,400
People aren't always going to
kill novelists. There's a card.

1678
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:43,690
The cartoonists who got stabbed in Holland
do to Muslims people go after most.

1679
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:46,040
It's like I was killed right.
Yeah he was murdered.

1680
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,120
Yeah he's just a cartoonist you know.

1681
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:53,960
Yeah it's like the soft target of comedy
is the idea that there's this like this

1682
01:37:55,011 --> 01:38:00,011
real subtlety to language and there's a
subtlety to sarcasm and being facetious

1683
01:38:00,110 --> 01:38:04,730
and you know when someone's
being sarcastic but if you
just see it written down

1684
01:38:04,731 --> 01:38:09,731
on paper you can for just for purposes
of being morally outraged you can pretend

1685
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,850
that you don't know that it's sarcastic.

1686
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:17,810
Yeah and you could pretend that this is
just a horrible statement and people got

1687
01:38:17,811 --> 01:38:20,810
in trouble for that many many many times
especially when you take something like

1688
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:22,910
on Twitter like in a text form.

1689
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:27,050
Yeah and you try to pretend that that's
a statement and you try to pretend that

1690
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:29,960
oh this is just someone who's
you know this is an asshole.

1691
01:38:30,230 --> 01:38:32,480
This is the person is just
a really evil mean person.

1692
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:36,380
No no it's this is a person who's fucking
around like there's an art form to

1693
01:38:36,381 --> 01:38:38,420
saying fucked up things
that you don't really mean.

1694
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:41,630
Yeah like you could say something fucked
up and I know that you're not serious

1695
01:38:41,631 --> 01:38:44,330
so I'll start laughing and
then we'll go that's so wrong.

1696
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:49,490
But but it's we know it's funny because
it's not a statement. Yeah not exactly.

1697
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:51,410
But there is like this P.C.

1698
01:38:51,411 --> 01:38:56,411
police thing going on now where a bunch
of people who in most of time when you

1699
01:38:56,781 --> 01:39:01,070
pay attention to those people because
I find it fascinating and I try to

1700
01:39:01,071 --> 01:39:04,490
consider myself to be a student of human
nature and one of the things that I

1701
01:39:04,491 --> 01:39:08,360
find about these people that complain
so much about all these different things

1702
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:12,800
and then they find this moral outrage or
find one thing to harp on over and over

1703
01:39:12,801 --> 01:39:17,801
again to say they usually extremely
troubled personally they usually like they

1704
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:22,370
it's usually like they have overwhelming
issues like they're morbidly obese or

1705
01:39:22,371 --> 01:39:26,150
they're you know socially inept or
there's something wrong with them that's

1706
01:39:26,151 --> 01:39:31,151
causing them to find this soft target
Yeah lash out constantly at this soft

1707
01:39:31,581 --> 01:39:36,581
target and then also if you look at like
what they do a lot of people what they

1708
01:39:36,711 --> 01:39:41,510
do is like Dell what they're trying to
do is stop someone from hurting someone's

1709
01:39:41,511 --> 01:39:46,070
feelings and they're they're trying to
say that what you're doing is mean and

1710
01:39:46,071 --> 01:39:50,280
you're hurting someone's feeling so what
I'm gonna do is hurt your feelings in

1711
01:39:50,281 --> 01:39:55,281
the most vicious and cruel way possible
you know with with these blogs and the

1712
01:39:55,820 --> 01:40:00,820
writing and I'm going to do to you what
you're somehow or another doing to him

1713
01:40:01,651 --> 01:40:03,380
being be a complete total hypocrite.

1714
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:07,970
Yeah but I have a license I have this
license of moral outrage I have this moral

1715
01:40:07,971 --> 01:40:12,200
high ground that I'm going to stand on
so I'm going to attack and I'm going to

1716
01:40:12,201 --> 01:40:17,201
you know to write this vicious snarky
column about a comedian in the ideas that

1717
01:40:19,490 --> 01:40:24,490
they're trying to right the wrongs and
trying to be the savior of what's good in

1718
01:40:24,591 --> 01:40:26,090
the world.
But that's not the case.

1719
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:29,540
What they're doing is just being an
asshole because they feel like they have a

1720
01:40:29,541 --> 01:40:34,541
license to be an asshole because they can
take what you said and put it on paper

1721
01:40:34,821 --> 01:40:39,821
and say look in quotes Tracy Morgan said
if his son was gay he'd stab them in

1722
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:40,610
quotes.

1723
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:45,500
So yeah fuck Tracy Morgan but
Tracy Morgan's a ridiculous
person like his whole

1724
01:40:45,501 --> 01:40:47,540
act is a bunch of shit
that he doesn't mean.

1725
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:51,770
Yeah it's a bunch of crazy things that
have never happened and he says a bunch

1726
01:40:51,771 --> 01:40:56,540
of crazy things because that's that's
his style of comedy like Mitch Hedberg

1727
01:40:56,541 --> 01:41:00,890
style of comedy is to say
really preposterous things
that other people wouldn't

1728
01:41:00,891 --> 01:41:01,460
like.

1729
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:06,350
My favorite Mitch Hedberg joke is somebody
asked me if I wanted a frozen banana.

1730
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:09,530
I said no but I want a
regular banana later.

1731
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:14,680
So yes so you know anybody else says
that it's a terrible joke but if he says

1732
01:41:15,171 --> 01:41:17,090
it's really funny that's his style.

1733
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:21,160
Tracy Morgan's Tyler's must
almost got stabbed to new.

1734
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:24,410
He doesn't really mean that.
That's not it's not a statement.

1735
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,210
It's no he's not writing that down.

1736
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:29,630
He didn't carved in stone and bring
it down from the top of a hill.

1737
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:30,973
It's his art form.

1738
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:36,280
But what's more upsetting than the people
who are so volatile and do get so mad

1739
01:41:37,071 --> 01:41:42,071
about stuff is the thing that politicians
do which is to feign that response.

1740
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,700
Yes like you politicians you know you
look at their career they vacillated

1741
01:41:46,701 --> 01:41:51,670
wildly between all these positions but
they love to get up and act like to act

1742
01:41:51,671 --> 01:41:53,230
like the morally outraged guy.

1743
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:57,190
Yes by thinking they were you know like
when you look in his eye like you don't

1744
01:41:57,191 --> 01:42:02,191
care at all about that but you're
like feigning the guy who is that way.

1745
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:04,600
And that's more of saying that's
the one who really is mad about it.

1746
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:07,810
Yeah well sometimes people are mad about
something that's just a perspective

1747
01:42:07,811 --> 01:42:12,760
issue. They just lack perspective or they
lacked a lot of it is a lack of social

1748
01:42:12,761 --> 01:42:13,900
intelligence you know.

1749
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:18,910
And there's also a lack of having nuanced
friends having friends that have good

1750
01:42:18,911 --> 01:42:19,720
sense of humor.

1751
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:23,650
People that joke around death things or
say mean things like some of my favorite

1752
01:42:23,651 --> 01:42:28,240
people like Jim Norton is
one of my favorite comedians
and is my favorite guy on

1753
01:42:28,241 --> 01:42:31,870
the radio because he says ridiculous
evil mean shit all the time.

1754
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:33,850
But he doesn't mean it he'll
laugh after he says it.

1755
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,860
Yeah but he's really smart about how he
does it and he takes a tremendous amount

1756
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:42,460
of grief because of it because people
will try to point out some of the things

1757
01:42:42,461 --> 01:42:47,020
that he says and then you know and accuse
him of being you know homophobic or

1758
01:42:47,021 --> 01:42:51,400
this that one of the least homophobic
guys you'll ever meet in fact he will talk

1759
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:55,510
openly about how many experiences he's
had with trannies he's had like all these

1760
01:42:55,511 --> 01:43:00,360
transsexual expects a pervert complete
total pervert but he's like he owns it in

1761
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:01,333
and way.

1762
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:06,470
And you know he takes grief because he's
a soft target because you know you can

1763
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:11,470
point to look they're looking for someone
to say outrageous shit so they can be

1764
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:12,100
angry.

1765
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:16,420
So who more likely to say outrageous shit
and someone says outrageous shit for a

1766
01:43:16,421 --> 01:43:20,440
living. And sometimes they say
outrageous shit and it doesn't work.

1767
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:25,470
You know it's not funny but Patrice
O'Neal had a great point about that.

1768
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:30,190
The late great Patrice O'Neal one of my
was that he's a really funny comedian

1769
01:43:30,191 --> 01:43:32,950
who died.
Yeah.

1770
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:36,220
He's one of my favorite guys to talk about
controversial point because you had a

1771
01:43:36,221 --> 01:43:40,150
unique way of looking at it but is his
point was always that like when someone

1772
01:43:40,151 --> 01:43:44,560
says something and trying to be funny
and it misses and it's fucked up that

1773
01:43:44,561 --> 01:43:48,790
comes from the same place as someone
trying to say something funny and it hits

1774
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:53,080
and it's really funny and you laugh
like just because they miss you you know

1775
01:43:53,081 --> 01:43:57,610
with this attempt doesn't mean they're
like an evil mean person they just failed.

1776
01:43:57,730 --> 01:43:58,700
Yeah that's a good boy.

1777
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:01,510
You know it's not they're not trying to
hurt someone's feelings they're trying

1778
01:44:01,511 --> 01:44:04,630
to get a laugh and that's
what what comedy is.

1779
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:06,950
There's a there's a real art to that.

1780
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:09,970
But but
yeah you're right.

1781
01:44:10,090 --> 01:44:14,290
I mean that's a cop that's that's a
complicated idea and is very complicated.

1782
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,750
Well you know my friend Joey
Diaz did he will open up for me.

1783
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:20,500
Yeah I love that fucking no man funny.
He's hilarious.

1784
01:44:20,590 --> 01:44:21,940
The funniest guy I've ever met in my life.

1785
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:23,950
But he has this joke about transvestites.

1786
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:25,850
He goes I love transvestites.

1787
01:44:25,870 --> 01:44:29,800
They cook they clean you can beat on
every once in a while the cops come.

1788
01:44:29,950 --> 01:44:32,290
Who's going to believe me as some
dude with a wig and a black eye.

1789
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:37,720
Okay look Joey Diaz has never punched a
transvestite he's never he's never had a

1790
01:44:37,781 --> 01:44:41,890
transvestite over his house with a
wig and had him cooking cleaning.

1791
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,390
It's not true.

1792
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:48,100
It's a joke like you could say that's
a violence against transsexuals joke or

1793
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:51,640
violence against transvestites Joe but
it's not it's not promoting violence

1794
01:44:51,641 --> 01:44:55,300
against anybody. It's a joke. It's
a fucked up thing that he's saying.

1795
01:44:55,690 --> 01:44:58,500
And you know it's it's got a good joke.

1796
01:44:58,630 --> 01:45:00,950
It's a great joke. My fave one
of my favorite jokes of all time.

1797
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:05,440
But you gotta understand what it
actually is what it actually is.

1798
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:09,940
It's just it's it's just like Johnny Cash
pretending he shot a man in Reno just

1799
01:45:09,941 --> 01:45:12,470
to watch him die.
It's is exactly the same thing.

1800
01:45:12,610 --> 01:45:17,520
But I wish Patrice O'Neal.
Yeah yeah yeah he yes.

1801
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:22,670
Yeah I wish she was here because there's
so it's like you've been in a situation

1802
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:27,500
where someone said something that
they wanted to be funny. Yes.

1803
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:31,070
Let's say they're made that someone
makes a crack about gays. Mm hmm.

1804
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:36,400
And it flops a way that it can flop is
if it if they're so transparent that you

1805
01:45:38,151 --> 01:45:43,151
see a win you see in them for a minute
and you're like wow that really comes

1806
01:45:44,830 --> 01:45:47,700
yeah from a place of
deep hatred yes yes yes.

1807
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:52,340
And it's not funny because in that
I got a glimpse into that. Mm hmm.

1808
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:57,790
You know yes if you make a gay joke I
know from I don't know why from your

1809
01:45:58,341 --> 01:46:03,341
demeanor whatever it is I know that you're
not at home you know wishing you'd go

1810
01:46:05,701 --> 01:46:08,920
out and kill gay people right.
How do I know that.

1811
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:12,880
Well it allows you to explore
like a funny idea you know.

1812
01:46:12,930 --> 01:46:17,520
But sometimes some say something like
man this person really has a problem with

1813
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:21,120
black people who are in a power position.
It's like you see it.

1814
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:26,420
It's intent the intent becomes transparent
when when someone is a kind person

1815
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:31,640
and someone just pointing out hypocrisy
like I have this bit making fun of

1816
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:35,490
Marci. Marcy is the lead
singer of The Smiths do it.

1817
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:37,950
But how soon is now is a rock solid song.

1818
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,470
But I know you're more it's
not laughed at. Yeah I should.

1819
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:44,400
I was like the know a guy because I could
come out and said You know what I like

1820
01:46:44,401 --> 01:46:45,930
how soon is now with
that shit about Maurice.

1821
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:48,330
He was funny.
He makes he makes good music.

1822
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:53,390
He doesn't make good music but his
idea that you know all you know war is

1823
01:46:53,521 --> 01:46:55,030
created by heterosexuals.
Yeah.

1824
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:57,710
It's not only not supported
by history but it's her day.

1825
01:46:57,750 --> 01:47:02,750
But the point is like when I when I talk
about that onstage I make a big point

1826
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:07,740
out of the fact that I want to make sure
that like I don't want anybody to think

1827
01:47:07,741 --> 01:47:09,390
that I have any problem gay people.

1828
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:14,600
But I also don't want any gay people to
just take random jabs at the giant mass

1829
01:47:14,881 --> 01:47:18,540
of straight people and say
we're responsible for all
the wars it's fucking it's

1830
01:47:18,541 --> 01:47:19,440
all ridiculous.

1831
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:24,750
And if you make as a 10 percent of the
wars where the response were came at you

1832
01:47:24,751 --> 01:47:28,350
know we're the gays responsible for 10
percent of the wars and it would upset

1833
01:47:28,351 --> 01:47:29,184
the theory.

1834
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:33,840
Well all you'd have to do is look at
history like the Spartans all the gay

1835
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:36,870
Athenians the Romans all
the gay sex they had.

1836
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:41,430
I think a lot of time fighting bastards
that Alexander the Great is one of the

1837
01:47:41,431 --> 01:47:43,740
greatest conquerors ever
he's gay as fuck you know.

1838
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:48,150
I think that one of the the things
about people that are in a group is they

1839
01:47:48,151 --> 01:47:52,020
always want to assume that this is
the good group to be in you know.

1840
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:56,220
And the idea that all gay people are
cool is ridiculous because people are

1841
01:47:56,221 --> 01:47:56,700
people.

1842
01:47:56,700 --> 01:48:01,700
There's a huge range of how people can
behave you know whether it's gay people

1843
01:48:02,341 --> 01:48:07,341
or straight people like there's a there's
a bit I do about I used to work out at

1844
01:48:07,951 --> 01:48:11,190
this gay gym and these gay dude
used to hit on me all the time.

1845
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:16,050
At this I used to work out at Gold's
Gym on Cole Street and because it was so

1846
01:48:16,051 --> 01:48:18,210
gay that because you were there
it was assumed you must be gay.

1847
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:20,040
Well they were just you're a man.

1848
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:24,480
It's like if you're a guy and you go to
a gym and there's a hot lesbian working

1849
01:48:24,481 --> 01:48:28,720
out there you know are you gonna
just you do you gonna take a shot.

1850
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:33,900
Yeah they can try to find out how lesbian
and I got you know and the the idea

1851
01:48:34,441 --> 01:48:39,270
that gay guys are immune for from
sexual harassment they're not going to

1852
01:48:39,271 --> 01:48:43,590
sexually harass you because they're
from this marginalized group.

1853
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:46,800
So they would they would be different
there'd be they would be kinder and

1854
01:48:46,801 --> 01:48:50,040
sweeter and more and more
bullshit they're dudes with dicks.

1855
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:53,380
They'll spike your drink just like a
straight guy will spike your drink.

1856
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:55,320
A gay guy will spike your drink.

1857
01:48:55,350 --> 01:48:58,880
Of course there's gonna be gay
guys in my group drink fuck yeah.

1858
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,040
Gay guys would roof you just like a
straight guy I would root for you.

1859
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:05,310
The idea that someone is really super
cool just because they're gay is

1860
01:49:05,311 --> 01:49:06,144
ridiculous.

1861
01:49:06,230 --> 01:49:09,120
It's just like the idea of someone being
super cool because they're black you

1862
01:49:09,121 --> 01:49:14,040
know like marginalized groups have a
little bit of leeway with a lot of like

1863
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:19,100
knee jerk reactionary bleeding
heart liberals which is
why guys like Al Sharpton

1864
01:49:19,771 --> 01:49:23,490
is allowed to be on television.
Al Sharpton is a con man and an idiot.

1865
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:28,660
But yet he represents black people on
television because no one wants the same

1866
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:30,410
thing about him because he's black.

1867
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:34,500
If you pick on Al Sharpton you're picking
on marginalized people and you are

1868
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:37,250
therefore a racist because
he represents brown people.

1869
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:40,390
Look at his skin he's a brown guy.
He's allowed to say.

1870
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:44,850
But meanwhile if you follow his career I
mean the guy made his living off of the

1871
01:49:44,851 --> 01:49:49,560
Tawana Brawley thing where there was a
fake rape where he you know he came out

1872
01:49:49,561 --> 01:49:53,460
and had this gigantic protest and it
turns out that this woman Tawana Brawley

1873
01:49:53,461 --> 01:49:55,470
was never really raped in the
first place she made it all up.

1874
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:57,510
Yeah and he was the champion of all this.

1875
01:49:57,540 --> 01:50:00,960
It was you know attacking white people
and attacking white America and the

1876
01:50:00,961 --> 01:50:04,470
racist establishment has allowed
this to happen. Actually not really.

1877
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:05,550
You're kind of a con man.

1878
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:08,310
You know and what you're doing is you're
taking advantage of a weakness in the

1879
01:50:08,311 --> 01:50:09,000
system.

1880
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,730
I just had occasion. I'm
not going to go into. I had.

1881
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:16,770
OK I just read the first and last chapter
of al sharpton the most recent book.

1882
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:20,460
No like the second or third
chapter in the last chapter.

1883
01:50:20,490 --> 01:50:23,010
I read the second or third
chapter and it kind of changed.

1884
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:27,720
I kind of I wrote his opinion about
it from I like that's really like.

1885
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:28,580
Like he had it.

1886
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:31,820
He made an interesting point
about something and expressed
it really well and he

1887
01:50:31,821 --> 01:50:36,150
got talked about his own evolution.
He went through on an idea like a flip.

1888
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:38,460
He explained what would be
in politics a flip flop.

1889
01:50:38,790 --> 01:50:43,170
He did a big flip flop and kind of
walked through how a public figure does a

1890
01:50:43,171 --> 01:50:47,310
flip flop. No good then read the last
chapter and I just went back to being.

1891
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:50,120
Who you are.

1892
01:50:51,410 --> 01:50:55,290
I've read those folks I'm reading that
book on about it with their money.

1893
01:50:55,470 --> 01:50:57,400
No no no no never mind the good times.

1894
01:50:57,550 --> 01:51:02,550
And every now about a guy comes out to
me and this guy looks like a yachtsman.

1895
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:05,640
Like a good guy or on a yacht.
And he comes at me

1896
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:09,480
because he goes Sharpton.

1897
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:15,260
I had a meeting with Al Sharpton one time
he came in in a chauffeured car and he

1898
01:51:17,961 --> 01:51:22,961
was wearing a gold Rolex presidential
watch and the first thing he tells me is

1899
01:51:25,241 --> 01:51:28,000
how he survives on a ten
thousand dollars salary.

1900
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:31,540
Then the guy left walked on the street.

1901
01:51:31,570 --> 01:51:33,850
Now at the end of the
story was a Sharpton story.

1902
01:51:34,830 --> 01:51:37,570
He's what would they call a race pimp.

1903
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,110
You know I think that's the
best way to describe him.

1904
01:51:40,190 --> 01:51:45,190
He him and you know Jesse Jackson has
made a lucrative business out of going to

1905
01:51:45,581 --> 01:51:49,240
businesses and saying you
don't have enough diversity
in your businesses hire me

1906
01:51:49,241 --> 01:51:50,074
as a consultant.

1907
01:51:50,290 --> 01:51:54,640
He steps in as a consultant and gets
an exorbitant amount of money to try to

1908
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:57,160
teach them how to hire black
people in their businesses.

1909
01:51:57,430 --> 01:51:59,290
If they don't do it he's
going to protest them.

1910
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:01,810
And that's the the
insinuation behind all of it.

1911
01:52:02,110 --> 01:52:06,700
And it's the only reason why it exists
is because there has been racism no

1912
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:10,150
reason why exists because black people
have been marginalized that evil things

1913
01:52:10,151 --> 01:52:13,480
have taken place. And then two hundred
years ago black people were slaves.

1914
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:15,160
All those things are absolutely true.

1915
01:52:15,190 --> 01:52:19,720
So there's this there's you know this
reality to what they're saying that there

1916
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:21,490
is racism there is inequality.

1917
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:26,550
So there's someone is coming along as
capitalizing on that that problem but it's

1918
01:52:26,831 --> 01:52:27,440
not.

1919
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:31,420
There's no Martin Luther King's life I
was like at my house here the day my wife

1920
01:52:31,421 --> 01:52:36,370
was playing a Martin Luther King speech
because Martin Luther King Day is Monday

1921
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,770
and my daughter's like
who's Martin Luther King.

1922
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:41,380
So my wife is playing this
speech for our five year old.

1923
01:52:41,740 --> 01:52:44,240
And you know what was it the
promised lands. Yes yeah.

1924
01:52:44,330 --> 01:52:46,680
I got to make what a
speech got gentler speech.

1925
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:52,160
Well it's like I'm a teacher
played that for us once it's me.

1926
01:52:52,610 --> 01:52:54,310
Especially like when you
hear like what happened.

1927
01:52:54,610 --> 01:52:58,720
I mean yeah for his assassination. Yeah.
And so by healing him he predicts it.

1928
01:52:58,930 --> 01:53:00,610
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1929
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:04,510
Well he knew it was coming. I mean it
was an incredible time man. Unbelievable.

1930
01:53:04,930 --> 01:53:08,110
Well not just incredibly written
and incredibly performed.

1931
01:53:08,170 --> 01:53:12,320
And while we're watching it I was like
There's no one like this anymore where

1932
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:15,410
where's this guy. Where's this guy
that represents the black community.

1933
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:20,430
A guy who is making like these incredible
points and is saying something that's

1934
01:53:21,311 --> 01:53:25,750
so moving and then you look
in the audience and it's
so mixed is why people next

1935
01:53:25,751 --> 01:53:30,751
to black people and such an incredible
time in our in our culture where people

1936
01:53:31,241 --> 01:53:35,170
realize that there there was these
inequalities and there was this this

1937
01:53:35,171 --> 01:53:40,171
groundswell of movement to try to make
the world equal and behind it or the

1938
01:53:40,420 --> 01:53:44,640
figurehead of it is this incredibly
powerful incredibly intelligent guy who's

1939
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:48,610
probably the greatest public speakers
of all time and an operator Yeah.

1940
01:53:48,690 --> 01:53:50,770
Just.
Hi I have a dream.

1941
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:54,700
And you see him say it and he's just like
God damn it just gives you goose bumps

1942
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:57,790
and then you see Jesse Jackson he
cannot stand a fucking word he says he's

1943
01:53:57,791 --> 01:54:01,600
mumbling through shit eating shrimp
cocktails flying in private jets.

1944
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:04,990
He's like this is what's left.
This is what's left of these guys.

1945
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:07,610
There's no guy like that.
You know I.

1946
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:09,700
I'm not a fan of Obama.

1947
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:14,740
I'm you know I was a fan of Obama
the candidate of the idea of Obama.

1948
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:17,110
But Obama in office.
I'm not I'm not a fan.

1949
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:19,120
I'm not a fan of most of what he's done.

1950
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:23,860
Not a fan of the whole NSA thing is
spying on people the use of drones is so

1951
01:54:23,861 --> 01:54:24,400
many things.

1952
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:27,460
It's almost too much to mention but
one of the things that makes me so

1953
01:54:27,461 --> 01:54:32,461
disappointed in him is his lack of
anything that he's ever said that's

1954
01:54:32,831 --> 01:54:33,670
inspirational.

1955
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:39,240
The speech that he could have given the
speeches that Kennedy gave Kennedy gave

1956
01:54:39,461 --> 01:54:44,461
some fucking speeches that made you change
your idea of what's possible for the

1957
01:54:45,131 --> 01:54:48,670
future of this country. But I don't get
any of that from Obama. I get these.

1958
01:54:48,710 --> 01:54:52,810
No he will but it's funny because being
a performer is really I mean like being

1959
01:54:52,811 --> 01:54:55,480
a performer is what launched him
to where he is. Sure. Exactly.

1960
01:54:55,540 --> 01:54:57,850
Yeah it's because that
speech at the convention.

1961
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,300
Oh yeah. Well yeah. That and
just the idea of who he was.

1962
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:02,440
I mean we were coming from.

1963
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:03,270
Yeah.

1964
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:07,120
Yeah an amazing narrative you know about
the but one of the earliest criticisms

1965
01:55:07,121 --> 01:55:09,670
was its performances. Yeah. Well I mean.

1966
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:12,410
But all speeches are
made their performances.

1967
01:55:12,490 --> 01:55:14,950
It's hard not like when you go look like
if you look like Hitler giving a speech.

1968
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:19,020
It's hard not even fathom how I would
ever be that he's not as a loon.

1969
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:21,860
I mean you look. How would it not
be. It's like transparently lunatic.

1970
01:55:22,110 --> 01:55:25,130
By the time it was like he would give
these amazing performances that would get

1971
01:55:25,131 --> 01:55:30,131
people stirred up and you know it's hard
to grasp the context of Hitler because

1972
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:31,520
I don't speak German.

1973
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:35,420
If I spoke German maybe I could
understand like all like all the maniacal

1974
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:38,570
everything he does. What does that. Yeah.

1975
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:43,600
It's so intense and so crazy but the
the the Obama speeches like there's like

1976
01:55:45,891 --> 01:55:49,760
there's nothing like oh can we back up
please don't think I was doing the ole

1977
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:52,050
like Hitler Obama thing.

1978
01:55:53,090 --> 01:55:54,170
No I didn't think you were doing that.

1979
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:58,050
I just thought maybe you're not powerful
or no yeah no maybe nervous something I

1980
01:55:58,051 --> 01:55:58,884
don't.

1981
01:55:59,270 --> 01:56:00,710
Yeah that's a touchy subject right.

1982
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:02,660
You know you you're a Nazi.

1983
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:06,650
STEPHEN LINNELL a Nazi the front
cover of whatever magazine.

1984
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:12,100
Yeah I think we have a serious lack of
these powerful inspirational characters

1985
01:56:13,971 --> 01:56:18,971
these people that that go on TV and or
give speeches would they really like her

1986
01:56:20,481 --> 01:56:22,130
vision to them.
Yeah.

1987
01:56:22,330 --> 01:56:26,540
I mean Obama had some of
that as a candidate but as
a president it's almost like

1988
01:56:27,020 --> 01:56:29,570
he looks so tired when I see him on TV.

1989
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:33,890
He looks so goddamn tired and I remember
when he was running like we had Bush

1990
01:56:33,891 --> 01:56:37,440
and Cheney we're at war and we're in a
war that most people didn't support and

1991
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:40,970
was very confusing and it was coming
out that the pretense of this war was

1992
01:56:40,971 --> 01:56:44,570
incorrect and there wasn't really any
weapons of mass destruction and all these

1993
01:56:44,770 --> 01:56:48,290
all those lives and devastation and
people were looking into Halliburton and

1994
01:56:48,291 --> 01:56:52,370
that connection that Cheney felt evil it
felt like we were we were trapped with

1995
01:56:52,371 --> 01:56:53,960
these evil old white dudes.

1996
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:58,760
And here comes along this guy who's you
know single mother who comes from single

1997
01:56:58,761 --> 01:57:03,410
mother and he's half black and he's so
intelligent so well so well read and so

1998
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:07,010
so well-spoken and we thought this was
going to be the change this is gonna be

1999
01:57:07,011 --> 01:57:09,980
the big shift. Yeah. And it
didn't turn out to be that at all.

2000
01:57:10,340 --> 01:57:12,470
It turned out to be just
kind of more of the same.

2001
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:17,360
But no no more inspiration all
that inspiration shit's gone.

2002
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:21,800
I mean he's so vibrant as a candidate
and as a president I can't remember a

2003
01:57:21,801 --> 01:57:26,210
single time that he's ever like addressed
the nation where I was like that's a

2004
01:57:26,211 --> 01:57:29,100
bad motherfucker. Like there's
there's something there. Oh yeah.

2005
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:32,090
He's saying something that
really gets people excited.

2006
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:35,150
It's been you know it's been so divisive
but I always think like when I look at

2007
01:57:35,151 --> 01:57:37,660
things that look like
things that happened.

2008
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:41,820
There's a there's things that happens to
candidates you know I think that it has

2009
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:45,260
so much to do with money like we get
these figures you know going into the

2010
01:57:45,261 --> 01:57:48,770
primaries you get you know you get these
figures that have these you know they

2011
01:57:48,771 --> 01:57:52,430
bucked the trends and Mavericks might
say marriage I'm not like Trent I'm not

2012
01:57:52,431 --> 01:57:55,980
referring strictly to McCain you get these
people that come in and they're gonna

2013
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:01,000
like upset the status quo then you have
to play the politics game and you all so

2014
01:58:01,121 --> 01:58:05,560
much stuff for money and then you pay
those debts and it's like corrupting.

2015
01:58:05,590 --> 01:58:09,310
And I think a similar thing happens
that people often in office I think that

2016
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:13,570
like I can't imagine what it must be to
be president I say and I say this time

2017
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,650
out George W.

2018
01:58:14,651 --> 01:58:18,220
Bush and Obama can't Maduro's be when
you present and someone comes in every

2019
01:58:18,221 --> 01:58:23,221
morning and runs through the list of
threats and you hear it and hear it and

2020
01:58:24,831 --> 01:58:29,831
hear it and it's like threats threats
threats threats I the paranoia that must

2021
01:58:30,931 --> 01:58:35,790
exist you know. I think it has to be
really taxing on people. No doubt.

2022
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,170
And every decision you make.

2023
01:58:37,230 --> 01:58:42,060
And it's like it's like yeah it's going
to be it will be your legacy and you're

2024
01:58:42,061 --> 01:58:46,680
like and it's gonna be wrenching to just
have to make those decisions all time.

2025
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:51,520
They look I mean guys come
on office looking so rough.

2026
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:55,030
Yeah it's probably no one.

2027
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:58,840
You never have a guy do
one term real popular.

2028
01:58:59,710 --> 01:59:02,330
He's like You know what.
Fuck this I'm not doing it.

2029
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:05,710
Yeah there's something like It's
so intoxicating to be president.

2030
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:07,053
Do you think that's it.

2031
01:59:07,060 --> 01:59:10,970
I think they probably don't let him
you know he probably has a look man.

2032
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:14,200
We have a fucking deal that we
got we got you into this mess.

2033
01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:15,103
What are we funny though.

2034
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:20,080
Well since George Washington they say
he could've won again and he left.

2035
01:59:20,110 --> 01:59:23,160
He only had one term. No but he was
gonna. People were like do three.

2036
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:26,040
They want him.
They wanted to keep rolling.

2037
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:29,180
And he stepped down and I think he might
have been the last guy that wouldn't

2038
01:59:29,190 --> 01:59:32,130
been like well take another one.
Bloomberg took out.

2039
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:35,620
Jimmy Carter's one of the
few guys that was President.

2040
01:59:35,650 --> 01:59:39,130
I would really love to sit down with and
have a private conversation because he

2041
01:59:39,131 --> 01:59:43,540
seems to be like a true humanitarian and
he seems to be at all the people that

2042
01:59:43,541 --> 01:59:44,380
wherever ever president.

2043
01:59:44,410 --> 01:59:47,980
The guy who caused probably the least
amount of loss of lives in the least

2044
01:59:47,981 --> 01:59:52,160
amount of war and heartbreak
seems to be Jimmy Carter. Yeah.

2045
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:57,420
He seemed like a truly like a kind man
who wound up in this weird situation

2046
01:59:57,521 --> 02:00:00,460
where he was the president United States
and he's like he wound up in a weird

2047
02:00:00,461 --> 02:00:04,630
situation out in the desert
oh the hostage situation yeah.

2048
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:08,540
Oh well that's a crazy situation where
the fucking hostages were released as

2049
02:00:08,541 --> 02:00:10,070
soon as Reagan got into office.

2050
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:12,830
Mike what kind of fucking
weird deal did you guys make.

2051
02:00:12,860 --> 02:00:16,340
Did you guys keep those people
hostage for for political gain.

2052
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:21,420
That's one of the most
disgusting possibilities in
the history of power in the

2053
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:26,060
presidency. That doesn't
make any sense. But you know.

2054
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:29,930
You know to me it's like the idea that
that's a possibility that they might have

2055
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:34,070
kept those people and use them as a
political ploy is pretty pretty gross.

2056
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:37,550
That's bad but probably did happen.
I don't know man.

2057
02:00:38,450 --> 02:00:41,720
Like you said Who the fuck knows what
it's like once you get into office who who

2058
02:00:41,721 --> 02:00:44,180
has any idea. I just don't think
there should be a president.

2059
02:00:44,510 --> 02:00:48,320
I think the idea of having this one
alpha chimp running the whole show is so

2060
02:00:48,321 --> 02:00:51,260
fucking archaic it probably
works and was 50 of us.

2061
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:54,600
What you want to go Parliament.
I don't know what I want to go.

2062
02:00:54,650 --> 02:00:55,610
I want to go Internet.

2063
02:00:55,880 --> 02:01:00,880
I think I think we need to go be like
this to be like those shows where people

2064
02:01:01,221 --> 02:01:04,040
vote from home. Like every issue
is always about this thing.

2065
02:01:04,180 --> 02:01:07,160
It's like everyday homes cars voting
on every issue son of the president.

2066
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:10,280
The president should attack not as well.

2067
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:14,690
I just think the idea of having one
person or a figurehead that pretends to be

2068
02:01:14,691 --> 02:01:17,180
the one person that runs
the show is just so archaic.

2069
02:01:17,330 --> 02:01:20,810
Well yeah but we have a system of
checks and balances man allegedly.

2070
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:24,043
If you look

2071
02:01:25,630 --> 02:01:29,900
if you if you look at the wild vacillation
that some countries go through OK

2072
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:32,290
then as well I mean you
rattle them off all day long.

2073
02:01:34,270 --> 02:01:38,470
People get frustrated with how slowly
things happen in the U.S.. That's the.

2074
02:01:38,650 --> 02:01:42,610
That's the story the gridlock
nothing gets done it's all idiots.

2075
02:01:43,090 --> 02:01:48,090
If you look at the gradual way one might
argue that all that gridlock and all

2076
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:53,551
that mayhem and things being so stagnant
somehow works to our benefit from it

2077
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:58,800
like from preventing wild swings
both is this lower that right.

2078
02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:04,320
You know we get like you know we're like
a really serious communist that we go

2079
02:02:04,361 --> 02:02:07,460
from that to a real serious anarchist
then we realize that doesn't work.

2080
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:08,890
We go to a you know

2081
02:02:10,650 --> 02:02:15,650
some wild as dictator I feel that
kind of like just kind of these mild

2082
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,170
undulations when taken when you view
it from a historic perspective I think

2083
02:02:20,171 --> 02:02:24,070
these mild undulations that we go
through in politics are to our benefit.

2084
02:02:24,910 --> 02:02:26,740
I'm like I'm a little bit pro gridlock.

2085
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:32,400
That's interesting because just if it
was just like so fast I feel like we'd

2086
02:02:32,621 --> 02:02:36,210
makes we have more stumbles
than we have I think.

2087
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:40,480
But I'm kind of like generally like an
optimist you know I'm a general optimist

2088
02:02:40,481 --> 02:02:40,930
too.

2089
02:02:40,930 --> 02:02:42,190
I just think there's too many people.

2090
02:02:42,610 --> 02:02:45,640
I think there's too many people too many
interests too much money too much too

2091
02:02:45,641 --> 02:02:48,970
many different directions to the money
things really should go like this.

2092
02:02:49,190 --> 02:02:53,560
This dude just got the mayor in New York
I want to go back to my show business

2093
02:02:53,561 --> 02:02:56,180
story to at some point.
No one tell me Mitch Hedberg story book.

2094
02:02:56,410 --> 02:03:00,990
And I want to talk about hunting pigs
mow how we had time. We're fine. OK.

2095
02:03:01,090 --> 02:03:04,100
So last month.
Oh yeah.

2096
02:03:04,180 --> 02:03:06,110
So the guy is the guy who's
got elected mayor in New York.

2097
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:11,240
I mean he's on an hour a day and he's
like OK no more we don't have any more

2098
02:03:11,241 --> 02:03:15,200
horses pulling carriages around
in Central Park. Really. Yeah.

2099
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:20,560
Right off the bat it's like are you tell
me you're now running the biggest city

2100
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:27,680
the one that like terror is drool
about you know the one that's like

2101
02:03:29,230 --> 02:03:34,030
like balancing all these like ethnic
groups and tensions and the one thing

2102
02:03:34,031 --> 02:03:37,840
that's on your mind when you come in
is that horses are pulling carriages in

2103
02:03:37,841 --> 02:03:38,860
Central Park and is mean.

2104
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:41,343
How could that pass.

2105
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:46,560
It has to be some dude wrote that guy
check you know and he's like here's the

2106
02:03:46,991 --> 02:03:51,500
deal I'm gonna give you this check but I
don't want him damn horses in that park

2107
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:53,250
because there's no
other way to explain it.

2108
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:56,550
It's like it shows candidates like weird
ignorance and arrogance where if you

2109
02:03:56,551 --> 02:04:00,540
talk to him who's involved in livestock
theft and livestock issues we have like.

2110
02:04:00,810 --> 02:04:04,470
We don't have a horse thief. We don't have
a not enough horse problem we have it.

2111
02:04:04,530 --> 02:04:08,610
There's too many horses like there's no
since the closure horse slaughter plants.

2112
02:04:08,670 --> 02:04:12,570
There's like people are dumping horses
people farmers will wake up and be like

2113
02:04:12,810 --> 02:04:16,530
wow there's a bunch of horses out of my
place because there's just no way to get

2114
02:04:16,531 --> 02:04:19,740
rid of excess horses you have all these
horses that are unwanted horses that are

2115
02:04:19,741 --> 02:04:23,100
starving horses that are being treated
properly and you've got these like

2116
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:28,130
gainfully employed horses that are fed
stabled care for veterinarian treatment

2117
02:04:28,650 --> 02:04:31,890
and the guy would be like the one
thing we need is unemployed horses.

2118
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:37,820
It has to be about some weird money
thing or it could be he's just a bleeding

2119
02:04:37,821 --> 02:04:39,650
heart liberal.
Now it doesn't look at it.

2120
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:42,110
You think so you think it's just a
money thing. I mean I don't know.

2121
02:04:42,170 --> 02:04:44,960
I can't see what the fuck
happened with a large drink thing.

2122
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:46,910
How did that ever take place.
That was Bloomberg.

2123
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:50,490
Yeah but it wound up not happening. Did
it really. Thank God. That's Riddick.

2124
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:51,770
No band never banned big pop.

2125
02:04:51,980 --> 02:04:54,020
Jesus Christ that drove me nuts.

2126
02:04:54,260 --> 02:04:56,330
The idea that you couldn't
get a big gulp or a giant.

2127
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:58,080
I never wanted those mediator.

2128
02:04:58,220 --> 02:05:00,890
Some computer is doing something he was
doing like a thing where he was like

2129
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:04,150
you're supposed to complete the sentence
like It's so hot you know. Mm hmm.

2130
02:05:04,490 --> 02:05:08,520
Then one was it's so hot. Bloomberg had
to go over to Jersey to get a Big Gulp.

2131
02:05:12,290 --> 02:05:14,790
Yeah.
But the nanny state stuff.

2132
02:05:14,870 --> 02:05:18,110
I hate it like I hate the like the all
the like telling people do not do free

2133
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:19,040
health.
I hate it.

2134
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:23,160
Yeah like I could also picture like how
frustrating because you be like Yeah

2135
02:05:23,260 --> 02:05:27,490
it's like if you look out like a guy who
smoked on cigarettes on hand like it's

2136
02:05:27,590 --> 02:05:30,200
not you know why. Right. You can't go.

2137
02:05:30,230 --> 02:05:33,530
You've got to be big you've got to be a
big enough of a man to walk away and be

2138
02:05:33,531 --> 02:05:36,530
like OK you know a ride a
motorcycle without a helmet.

2139
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:41,540
I'm like why then I'd sound like you
I'd be like a big enough person in some

2140
02:05:41,541 --> 02:05:46,541
weird way I'd be like OK you go ahead
and push on and I'm gonna try to not want

2141
02:05:46,671 --> 02:05:47,870
to like control your life.

2142
02:05:48,650 --> 02:05:50,440
Well there's gonna be people
look at you and go Dude.

2143
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:53,390
You can't talk about cigarettes or
motorcycles you got charged by a fucking

2144
02:05:53,391 --> 02:05:56,010
moose. Yeah. All right. I saw it.

2145
02:05:56,330 --> 02:05:59,230
I saw you get hit by a moose.
I watched it five times now.

2146
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:04,190
That was you describing it was harrowing
but watching it was way crazier when

2147
02:06:04,191 --> 02:06:06,410
that fucking thing got up and
started running towards you.

2148
02:06:06,650 --> 02:06:10,340
Even though I knew you were OK I met you
after the fact. I was like Oh he's dead.

2149
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:11,593
He's fucking dead.

2150
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:12,590
No.

2151
02:06:12,590 --> 02:06:17,590
We met there we met well before
but that's that was you know it.

2152
02:06:18,590 --> 02:06:21,370
You don't have tv like that
was what I did was so stupid.

2153
02:06:22,210 --> 02:06:25,270
Each one on one hand I did was
so dumb when I did not know.

2154
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:29,950
I thought I didn't mean it but what it
was so stupid that you'd want to then

2155
02:06:29,951 --> 02:06:34,060
hide how stupid you were and
not have it be on TV. Right.

2156
02:06:34,310 --> 02:06:35,950
They're like but it's compelling TV.

2157
02:06:36,110 --> 02:06:38,680
Yeah like a guy getting run over
by a moose is interesting you know.

2158
02:06:39,010 --> 02:06:42,290
So it's your thing of like your
ego where and now it'll happen.

2159
02:06:42,810 --> 02:06:44,680
We're calling you know Ryan Kelly.

2160
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:47,150
Yeah I love Ryan.
Great guy.

2161
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:50,770
We were calling moose
and when you call moose.

2162
02:06:53,170 --> 02:06:55,810
That's an excellent picture.
Go pinch your nostrils.

2163
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:03,560
That's the cow that's a cow saying I am
coming into Astros and party calling is

2164
02:07:05,850 --> 02:07:06,320
a fact.

2165
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:11,320
Like Moose Calling is effective right
before the run rate for the breeding

2166
02:07:11,731 --> 02:07:16,731
season because bulls know what's going
to happen like the cows are gonna wanna

2167
02:07:16,771 --> 02:07:21,570
be bred to breed them but the
cows have really got rolling yet.

2168
02:07:21,630 --> 02:07:23,040
So which is all anticipation.

2169
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:26,640
If they were actually all doing it and
the cows are really an Astros in the

2170
02:07:26,641 --> 02:07:30,030
bulls like with the cow that's an Astros
he's gonna be less likely to come to

2171
02:07:30,031 --> 02:07:33,530
one calling. You know it's all a timing
issue you got to catch him right. Yeah.

2172
02:07:33,630 --> 02:07:35,880
He wants it.
You're the first.

2173
02:07:35,910 --> 02:07:40,770
He's like there she is first cow to
come and just go get her. So we're out.

2174
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:43,410
Brian's mimicking the noise of a bull.

2175
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:48,690
I'm sorry mimicking the noise of a cow
and what inspired and begin doing that as

2176
02:07:48,691 --> 02:07:51,150
we heard a bowling ball make some
noise like this ball will go.

2177
02:07:53,710 --> 02:07:56,940
So that's all you heard.
It's like a soldier you don't
even hear it you feel it.

2178
02:07:57,480 --> 02:08:01,410
It's a suggestion of a noise.
It's like I was like What was it.

2179
02:08:01,860 --> 02:08:06,270
But it's very hard to determine where it
was not where it's harder. How far away.

2180
02:08:06,990 --> 02:08:11,160
And we heard that and then we debated
for a long time whether we'd heard it or

2181
02:08:11,161 --> 02:08:11,430
not.

2182
02:08:11,430 --> 02:08:15,350
We're like No I know I heard a bull I
heard a bull then it actually started to

2183
02:08:15,351 --> 02:08:17,930
thunder a little bit off in the distance
which made it even more confusing.

2184
02:08:17,970 --> 02:08:20,990
It was like Was it thunder or
was it that you know noise.

2185
02:08:21,710 --> 02:08:25,220
So Ryan starts trying to lure the bull
to us. This is on British Columbia.

2186
02:08:25,250 --> 02:08:30,250
He starts trying to lure the bull to us
by roaming around making cow calls and

2187
02:08:31,941 --> 02:08:35,720
he goes away from the bull and I stay put.

2188
02:08:35,810 --> 02:08:40,580
Hoping that the bull will come and he's
gonna want to see her before he gets too

2189
02:08:40,581 --> 02:08:41,060
close.

2190
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:46,060
So by Ryan staying about 75 yards further
away the bull might hang up in the

2191
02:08:47,411 --> 02:08:48,370
vicinity of where I'm at.

2192
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:51,730
You know while he's trying to get a
visual lock on the cow to make sure

2193
02:08:51,731 --> 02:08:55,510
everything looks safe and we keep calling
corn and then I'm starting I was going

2194
02:08:55,511 --> 02:08:59,870
crazy I never heard the bull in the
first place so we start going in the

2195
02:08:59,871 --> 02:09:02,530
direction eventually start moving in
the direction where we think the bull is

2196
02:09:02,540 --> 02:09:05,600
and sure enough I see some brush clashing
and he's in there rubbing his antlers

2197
02:09:05,601 --> 02:09:09,800
on some brush and Ryan starts calm and
now we're in his zone enough where he's

2198
02:09:09,801 --> 02:09:14,801
coming to investigate and he's coming
in and he kind of comes at me and I do

2199
02:09:16,191 --> 02:09:18,860
like a really stupid thing where I
take what you call a brisket shot and a

2200
02:09:18,861 --> 02:09:21,140
brisket shot a deer
wild pig is devastating.

2201
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:26,640
You you're coming in like the sternum
and you know it is devastating to the

2202
02:09:27,981 --> 02:09:30,860
animal a small animal
but I'm just so much.

2203
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:35,020
No it's like like layers of bricks and
stuff like basically at the front of made.

2204
02:09:35,570 --> 02:09:37,730
And he goes down and I
go running over there.

2205
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:42,090
And sure enough he gets up and starts
running and I'm worried like the last

2206
02:09:42,091 --> 02:09:45,810
thing I do is chase a moose
but I'm worried that maybe
he's not bleeding enough.

2207
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:50,900
So I start running after him and I get
up there and he's I catch up to when he's

2208
02:09:53,101 --> 02:09:58,101
laying down again and I go to shoot him
in the neck and click like I had messed

2209
02:09:59,961 --> 02:10:02,060
up my rifle and hadn't chambered around.

2210
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:07,240
So it clicks and that bull got up and
just turn in like came and boom knocked me

2211
02:10:08,391 --> 02:10:13,391
over like coming at you like you know
head down horns down like a bull you know

2212
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:15,353
head down horns.

2213
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:19,380
And he punched me in the ass of one
of his antler times and I thought it

2214
02:10:19,381 --> 02:10:20,214
punctured me.

2215
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:25,850
So I ran away and Callahan shoots the
moose down and I keep reaching around to

2216
02:10:26,461 --> 02:10:30,330
feel where he had popped me so hard
in the ass and knocked me over.

2217
02:10:31,250 --> 02:10:32,780
And my hankies come back bloody.

2218
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:36,770
So I'm trying to feel where he put a hole
in me and I'm thinking like he'd like

2219
02:10:36,860 --> 02:10:40,130
punched a hole through my waders
and into my into my arms tissue.

2220
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:45,590
And then I realized that like I got blood
all over it cause he had I'd hit him

2221
02:10:45,591 --> 02:10:48,890
in the brisket so when he ran me over he
like smeared a lot of that blood on the

2222
02:10:48,891 --> 02:10:53,120
back of my clothes. So that was the
blood I was feeling scared to help me.

2223
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:58,750
And you saw that was a few days before
I got charged by grizzly bear. Yeah.

2224
02:11:00,410 --> 02:11:01,520
It was a harrowing trip.

2225
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:04,610
Hey you're talking about people smoking
cigarettes and riding motorcycles with

2226
02:11:04,611 --> 02:11:05,444
no helmets.

2227
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:07,820
That moose deal was probably the closest.

2228
02:11:09,550 --> 02:11:13,820
You know like you fantasize about bad
stuff happen to you from big animals you

2229
02:11:13,821 --> 02:11:15,710
know like you can get
mauled by bear or whatever.

2230
02:11:16,050 --> 02:11:20,300
And what really gets his little teeth
things like I like my hospital stuff has

2231
02:11:20,301 --> 02:11:25,301
been you know like serious issues Ben
Giardina so drinking bad water and Lyme

2232
02:11:26,121 --> 02:11:30,530
disease by getting you know bit by
little teeny bugs that are infected with

2233
02:11:30,531 --> 02:11:34,100
bacteria and that's like
my real source of trouble.

2234
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:37,640
But when I'm laying in bed and then I'm
not thinking about microbes I'm thinking

2235
02:11:37,641 --> 02:11:42,440
about big giant animals coming to get
me in on that one came and knocked me in

2236
02:11:42,441 --> 02:11:45,860
the minute but it's like it's mixed
emotions this was happening like that was

2237
02:11:45,861 --> 02:11:48,230
the stupidest thing I ever did I
can't believe that I'm so dumb.

2238
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:52,970
And then and concurrent with that as a
thought of like I am so happy that that

2239
02:11:52,971 --> 02:11:54,690
happened.
That was an amazing thing you know.

2240
02:11:56,660 --> 02:12:00,710
And now it is stupid as it was down there
and I'm like I love that that happened

2241
02:12:01,220 --> 02:12:02,053
because you're OK.

2242
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:05,040
Yeah yeah.
It's actually mortifying.

2243
02:12:05,110 --> 02:12:09,800
Looking at it now I wouldn't even be
disappointed had he punched a hole in my

2244
02:12:09,801 --> 02:12:14,390
butt as long as you live. Yeah but what
if he hit your sack. Would have a horn.

2245
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:15,253
I mean think about that.

2246
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:16,190
I already got two kids.

2247
02:12:18,830 --> 02:12:22,460
You're cool with a hole in the sack
from what I can tell. Have two days.

2248
02:12:22,490 --> 02:12:25,770
My wife is like go down and get a
vasectomy half days. She's like No way.

2249
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:26,633
It's more one on one.

2250
02:12:26,750 --> 02:12:29,550
I just mean you know what David
is the dead issue now moves.

2251
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:34,790
Across my who was killed by
my Zach. I'm a eunuch. Wow.

2252
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:37,430
They'll be harsh.
It was fun man.

2253
02:12:37,490 --> 02:12:41,480
I mean I love that like you know you'll
appreciate this because I was reading

2254
02:12:41,481 --> 02:12:46,481
this book about human history called
Lone Survivor not Lone Survivor.

2255
02:12:46,890 --> 02:12:50,340
That's the seal story.
Yeah it's somebody lone survivors.

2256
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:53,780
It's by a geneticist a British geneticist.

2257
02:12:54,580 --> 02:12:57,700
And it was something
like that sole survivors.

2258
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:02,970
He talks about the suite of injuries
that are common to Neanderthal skeletons.

2259
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:03,833
I told you about this.

2260
02:13:04,290 --> 02:13:08,610
So like everyone they dig up Neanderthal
Skelton in the miles of caves and stuff

2261
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:12,630
like one you find that they've been cut
like their bone they've been butchered

2262
02:13:13,370 --> 02:13:17,200
so that they die and their bodies would
presumably their bodies are chromatic.

2263
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:20,520
And we've had a tendency to go eat
them and they also find all these like

2264
02:13:20,521 --> 02:13:25,521
fractured bones like busted bones
fractured skulls fractured vertebra Lone

2265
02:13:25,861 --> 02:13:26,940
Survivor yeah yeah.

2266
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:30,990
And in some ways in this book and these
guys kind of got warning like why do

2267
02:13:30,991 --> 02:13:35,991
they have this type of
injury and eventually some
doctor looks at the like the

2268
02:13:39,661 --> 02:13:43,170
injuries that are common in Neanderthals
and he says you know I see that as

2269
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:48,320
rodeo riders and it's like the things
that happen to people who are like mixing

2270
02:13:50,001 --> 02:13:52,320
it up with big critters.

2271
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:57,470
And the theory that this guy puts forward
not not Sykes not the guy that wrote

2272
02:13:57,471 --> 02:14:01,270
it was to pull it up again. What
is the name again. Christian. Yeah.

2273
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:02,890
So Chris I don't think
Chris Stringer fault said.

2274
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,010
He talks about a guy who floats this
idea that they had a confrontational

2275
02:14:07,011 --> 02:14:12,011
hunting style that Neanderthals did today
were in there you know tearing it up

2276
02:14:13,220 --> 02:14:17,030
and Cro Magnum has had a
little bit more of a stay back.

2277
02:14:17,570 --> 02:14:21,860
You know stay back and get them a
better time when the other tools are way

2278
02:14:21,861 --> 02:14:25,670
closer to the rest of the
animals than than we are.

2279
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:30,760
I mean they had they were five feet tall
200 plus pounds big thick fuckin bones

2280
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:35,210
no one else's is that they didn't have
a lot of sexual dysmorphia the males and

2281
02:14:35,211 --> 02:14:37,130
females are much more similar.
Really.

2282
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:41,460
Probably he met females were in there
hunting more probably had to be positive

2283
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:45,200
that they weren't just structurally
the females or similar.

2284
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:50,480
And so having that little run in with
that moose was kind of I felt like a

2285
02:14:50,481 --> 02:14:54,110
little bit in a positive way I felt a
little bit like maybe like there was like

2286
02:14:54,111 --> 02:14:58,400
a Neanderthal experience
with the Neanderthal thing
is weird man because they

2287
02:14:58,401 --> 02:15:01,670
find out like all these things that
biggest thing they didn't do was like

2288
02:15:01,730 --> 02:15:06,470
evidence that they that once they came
into contact with Cro Magnum it was like

2289
02:15:06,471 --> 02:15:10,180
they started picking up some of the
things that they were Indu like there's

2290
02:15:10,181 --> 02:15:13,560
evidence to suggest that like at that
they had been around for you know hundreds

2291
02:15:13,570 --> 02:15:17,530
thousand years and also in dudes show
up but we show up and also they kind of

2292
02:15:17,531 --> 02:15:21,310
got interested in decoration a little
bit I got interested in art a little bit.

2293
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:25,090
Music theory you know that they had see
they were somehow interacting with us

2294
02:15:25,091 --> 02:15:29,180
some were kind of like stealing our make
sense stealing our groove a little bit.

2295
02:15:29,450 --> 02:15:34,450
Well I mean you think about all the things
that we use guns computers this table

2296
02:15:34,700 --> 02:15:35,960
we didn't build in a shit.

2297
02:15:36,260 --> 02:15:38,700
Oh yeah yeah we figured it out
from other really smart human.

2298
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:42,230
Yeah you dad. And so they were
kind of like came into somehow.

2299
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:44,180
It was going on and there
was some internal aggression.

2300
02:15:44,210 --> 02:15:48,040
He talks a lot about that in that
book that there was there were

2301
02:15:49,640 --> 02:15:52,790
he argues a little bit argue that isn't
the case that the argument there is that

2302
02:15:52,791 --> 02:15:54,110
there was certainly some intro aggression.

2303
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:59,090
Yeah I've heard that and I've also heard
that it's it's confusion and that would

2304
02:15:59,091 --> 02:16:01,040
it really is is common ancestor.

2305
02:16:01,130 --> 02:16:04,940
Yeah. Know I've heard all. So I'm not
I'm not like I'm not definitely I'm.

2306
02:16:05,030 --> 02:16:08,910
You know when it comes to that kind of
stuff I'm not the guy let you do the same

2307
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:11,830
like I'm saying what
some people say right.

2308
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:16,200
You know I mean some people say that
it's an interesting idea and lots of

2309
02:16:16,201 --> 02:16:19,030
changes so fast. I always hate to be
like well this is what it was you know.

2310
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:20,490
But you talking about you know what.

2311
02:16:20,570 --> 02:16:23,760
What is the most recent version of
Neanderthals one hundred thousand years I

2312
02:16:23,761 --> 02:16:27,650
mean when they when they went out thirty
thirty thirty thirty five thirty thirty.

2313
02:16:27,850 --> 02:16:30,990
Could anybody know what the hell exactly
happened thirty five thousand years ago

2314
02:16:30,991 --> 02:16:35,820
it's too it's too far. He explains
how he explains what they know so far.

2315
02:16:35,970 --> 02:16:36,540
Well yeah.

2316
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:40,170
He explains how the people that have an
opinion on it came to form their opinion.

2317
02:16:40,770 --> 02:16:41,680
That makes sense you know.

2318
02:16:41,910 --> 02:16:46,910
Yeah but for sure I look I know men and
I know that if men live at the end of

2319
02:16:48,271 --> 02:16:49,710
thoughts somebody would affect.

2320
02:16:49,980 --> 02:16:51,780
Oh yeah I know dudes.

2321
02:16:52,190 --> 02:16:55,500
Yeah they would do it even if it was sort
of like an act of aggression like you

2322
02:16:55,501 --> 02:16:57,270
look at conquering forces you know.
Yeah.

2323
02:16:57,360 --> 02:16:59,910
On one hand they're coming into
Congress because they despise them.

2324
02:17:00,270 --> 02:17:05,270
But like dudes conquering dudes will
often find themselves you know like

2325
02:17:05,830 --> 02:17:08,640
history's full those examples where a
conquering army that's coming out to get

2326
02:17:08,641 --> 02:17:11,160
like the worst people on the planet
all they want to do is annihilate them.

2327
02:17:11,340 --> 02:17:15,890
But they also kind of have sex at.
Did you ever see there's one.

2328
02:17:16,070 --> 02:17:19,710
I think there's an Australian
anthropologist very
fringe guy but he had this

2329
02:17:19,711 --> 02:17:24,711
really funny take on Neanderthals that
they were the super predators and that we

2330
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:28,170
we hunted them and do extinction.
Yeah.

2331
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:31,950
Because he knows is that they
didn't look like people at all.

2332
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:35,640
They look like gorillas that Cro
Magnum hunted them. Yes. Yes.

2333
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:37,290
Did you ever see that.
No.

2334
02:17:37,350 --> 02:17:42,330
But but I've I don't know if I've seen
that guy's ideas but seeing the idea that

2335
02:17:42,331 --> 02:17:45,890
that's the case and what people point to
is that they always find butcher marks.

2336
02:17:45,930 --> 02:17:49,350
Not always but it's very common to find
butcher marks on those bones and also

2337
02:17:49,351 --> 02:17:51,990
find what to crack the heads open
and presumably get the brain out.

2338
02:17:52,230 --> 02:17:55,830
Yeah. I wish I could remember
killing Neanderthals.

2339
02:17:55,900 --> 02:18:00,480
I forget what the id be like if you shot
a Yeti now or not a Yeti if you shot

2340
02:18:00,481 --> 02:18:05,070
Sasquatch. People be
pissed. Oh yeah. You know.

2341
02:18:05,180 --> 02:18:09,630
Yeah but I bet you that crow mangling
the Neanderthal weren't is different.

2342
02:18:09,900 --> 02:18:12,510
There might not have been
as many differences between
those two as there would

2343
02:18:12,511 --> 02:18:16,220
be between us and a Sasquatch if you
haven't run into one hole up them in us.

2344
02:18:16,260 --> 02:18:20,940
Pull up some images the books called
them and us and his proposal was the eye

2345
02:18:20,941 --> 02:18:25,941
sockets were much larger the features
more simian the bone structure is much

2346
02:18:26,221 --> 02:18:31,221
closer to lower primates than ours and
we're just assuming we anthropomorphize

2347
02:18:31,441 --> 02:18:35,130
these animals and assume they had
white skin legs and hair like us.

2348
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:39,870
But he gives them like black skin like
a gorilla and you know decides that they

2349
02:18:39,871 --> 02:18:44,100
were these really intelligent
predators that hunted us down.

2350
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:47,100
We widely discredited.

2351
02:18:47,220 --> 02:18:49,440
Yeah but it's this is
look at this the images.

2352
02:18:50,530 --> 02:18:51,600
Well that's what you think they look like.

2353
02:18:51,630 --> 02:18:54,150
Yeah that looks like something
you'd have in your studio.

2354
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:56,610
Yeah exactly.
Yeah like a yeti or something.

2355
02:18:58,380 --> 02:18:59,970
This is his crazy idea.

2356
02:19:00,030 --> 02:19:04,530
I mean most likely horseshit but really
kind of fastening Von horseshit though.

2357
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:04,970
Yeah.

2358
02:19:04,970 --> 02:19:07,000
We don't have a soft tissue
from these fucking guys.

2359
02:19:07,020 --> 02:19:09,270
We don't really know what the hell was
going on. We don't have their skin.

2360
02:19:09,510 --> 02:19:12,300
We can't compare the color and texture.
We don't really know.

2361
02:19:12,570 --> 02:19:15,480
I think the picture will
become more clearer eventually.

2362
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:18,450
I mean because they get such
sophisticated ways looking at stuff.

2363
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:19,680
Well there was that one

2364
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:26,600
misinterpreted idea that I think a
Harvard geneticist was saying that one day

2365
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:31,740
could be possible and there may be an
ethical consideration that we would have

2366
02:19:31,741 --> 02:19:35,130
to ask a woman if she'd be willing
to give birth in Neanderthal baby.

2367
02:19:35,490 --> 02:19:39,330
And then it became you know distributed
Harvard geneticist wants women to give

2368
02:19:39,331 --> 02:19:42,710
birth to Neanderthal looking
for volunteers and like
taking place in the aerosol

2369
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:46,320
baby in your body like you know not it's
not exact what they're saying but like

2370
02:19:46,321 --> 02:19:48,610
this is what you would get so
many women that would do it.

2371
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:50,610
Fuck yeah for sure.

2372
02:19:50,670 --> 02:19:51,570
Just to become famous.

2373
02:19:51,750 --> 02:19:55,020
Look at that they would they think that
things might look like well sugar packet

2374
02:19:55,021 --> 02:19:56,750
that there's some footage of one.
Yeah.

2375
02:19:57,660 --> 02:20:02,190
Well the idea is that you know we we
think that they looked like people but he

2376
02:20:02,191 --> 02:20:04,710
kind of goes out the way of
giving a real sinister appearance.

2377
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:08,030
We'll look at the bone structure the
differences in the bone structure not

2378
02:20:08,430 --> 02:20:12,090
thicker and yeah he makes them look like
monsters in a movie with little tiny

2379
02:20:12,091 --> 02:20:14,100
dicks. Interesting. How
can they have little dicks.

2380
02:20:14,850 --> 02:20:18,740
I would think that thing would
have a giant dick whatever.

2381
02:20:18,810 --> 02:20:22,110
While we're thinking about Neanderthal
dicks coming tell me about tell me about

2382
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:23,410
your need for Mitch Hedberg story.

2383
02:20:24,380 --> 02:20:28,150
You know one thing about try out real
quick is not the great story but I had

2384
02:20:28,151 --> 02:20:33,151
this girlfriend who had this fellowship
she got in San Jose California and saw I

2385
02:20:33,181 --> 02:20:37,510
was back for Team Montana and saying
sales a whole time and there's always this

2386
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:40,030
marquee about this comedy house.
Oh you told me the story.

2387
02:20:40,380 --> 02:20:41,900
I didn't think you told on the podcast.
Good.

2388
02:20:42,290 --> 02:20:44,620
There's this marquee about the comedy
house and he kept saying like Mitch

2389
02:20:44,621 --> 02:20:48,430
Hedberg you know March or Mitch Hedberg
whatever it is always in the back of my

2390
02:20:48,431 --> 02:20:50,050
head like may I go get my
ticket got to get my ticket.

2391
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:53,710
And then one day I says
like we'll miss you Mitch.

2392
02:20:54,610 --> 02:20:57,070
I'm like Son of a bitch I thought
it was coming up you know.

2393
02:20:57,210 --> 02:21:00,430
And I thought I like that it mentally.
He came and performed and went home.

2394
02:21:00,460 --> 02:21:04,210
You know and I ran to the window be like
Why do you guys have it on your marquee

2395
02:21:04,220 --> 02:21:06,730
that is coming in March when he's
when he's already and she said no.

2396
02:21:06,870 --> 02:21:11,870
He died this morning. It's kind of a
weird I agree it's not a great story.

2397
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:14,270
It does.
It feels it feels that way to me.

2398
02:21:14,550 --> 02:21:18,410
There's the thing right there
that was all over the country.

2399
02:21:18,490 --> 02:21:20,870
Well it was those. Yeah they did
those everywhere they did though.

2400
02:21:20,910 --> 02:21:24,930
I think they did one at the Laugh Factory
the marquee at the Laugh Factory as

2401
02:21:24,931 --> 02:21:25,290
well.

2402
02:21:25,290 --> 02:21:30,290
Now Amanda was funny for my all time
favorites and clean to clean comedienne if

2403
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:31,970
I know.
Yeah he.

2404
02:21:32,190 --> 02:21:35,340
Have you gone on listen to the comedian
good storyteller Jerry clown that I'm

2405
02:21:35,340 --> 02:21:39,240
always asking you. Yeah. Yeah I did. I've
listened to you know like it. It's funny.

2406
02:21:39,270 --> 02:21:41,830
It's all about putting it in the context.
He's a funny guy.

2407
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:43,940
Yeah. Knowing the context. Otherwise.

2408
02:21:44,130 --> 02:21:46,380
Oh I thought that just
because had mid-February like
you could actually listen

2409
02:21:46,381 --> 02:21:48,880
to Mitch Hedberg with
your kid and your grandma.

2410
02:21:49,050 --> 02:21:52,780
Yeah yeah. He swears in the last one
the most most recent one he does.

2411
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:54,270
Says a few quite a few fucks.

2412
02:21:54,660 --> 02:21:56,850
Yeah I mean does that
good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2413
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:59,190
He's using them you know
Stoner is stoner humor.

2414
02:21:59,310 --> 02:21:59,970
Yeah he's.

2415
02:21:59,970 --> 02:22:04,320
He was a brilliant guy who really unique
comedian but too to bring it all around.

2416
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:07,350
I want you to bring it I want
you bring around the pigs.

2417
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:11,880
Well that's what we're doing this weekend
and I'm fired up like I told you I

2418
02:22:11,881 --> 02:22:16,881
shot 30 rounds today 60 yesterday and
then 300 fucking arrows the day before as

2419
02:22:18,511 --> 02:22:20,550
my right arm is so useless right now.

2420
02:22:20,990 --> 02:22:23,580
My I can't remember the last time
my right shoulder was a sore.

2421
02:22:24,030 --> 02:22:26,580
It's good that you're shooting them.
I miss a lot of shooting. Yeah.

2422
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:27,640
Ms Nottle is not alone.

2423
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:30,870
She never like guys are really into
shooting with a lot of shooting for a 3.

2424
02:22:30,970 --> 02:22:31,803
Good to.
No.

2425
02:22:31,860 --> 02:22:36,750
I mean to like to get that level of
proficiency coming just from repetition.

2426
02:22:37,170 --> 02:22:38,880
Yeah.
Learn how to do stuff through repetition.

2427
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:41,970
I'm not you know I'm a big
believer in preparation.

2428
02:22:42,030 --> 02:22:46,590
I don't believe and I like one of the
things that I learned when I was young

2429
02:22:46,650 --> 02:22:50,430
when I was competing mouse fighting
when I wasn't in that good shape I was

2430
02:22:50,431 --> 02:22:54,380
really fucking nervous. I was in really
good shape and I was really well trained.

2431
02:22:54,450 --> 02:22:59,040
My nerves were considerably less Yeah
and I think that that's with everything.

2432
02:22:59,150 --> 02:23:00,750
Yeah you gotta be fully prepared.

2433
02:23:00,790 --> 02:23:01,710
So yeah.

2434
02:23:01,770 --> 02:23:05,130
Guys I know like the guys and all the
best hunting that I somewhat you go out

2435
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:09,340
and you have to. It has to be you
know you're going to you know. Mm hmm.

2436
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:13,140
Cause if things get hard and things
get bad and things are going your way.

2437
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:16,380
If you've already been going into like
you didn't know what was going to happen.

2438
02:23:16,710 --> 02:23:19,490
It allows you to more quickly jump
into that it didn't happen right.

2439
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:22,320
Like if you go under like it has
to happen it will happen. Has that.

2440
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:27,270
Then when things are like sucky you
you still pursuing that narrative.

2441
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:29,880
You know what will happen
when we were in Montana.

2442
02:23:29,940 --> 02:23:32,710
You kept saying We're gonna get one.
You kept saying that.

2443
02:23:32,890 --> 02:23:35,340
Yeah we're gonna get it here. You keep
saying that we're gonna get there.

2444
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:39,930
Like you said that many times I feel
like what what we're doing this weekend

2445
02:23:39,931 --> 02:23:44,650
isn't gonna be you know
like hunting wild pigs.

2446
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:47,470
I mean there's gonna there's
gonna be obviously a lot of pigs.

2447
02:23:47,870 --> 02:23:50,080
I mean there's this place T.A.

2448
02:23:50,190 --> 02:23:55,190
John to HoN t e t o n Jahan ranch.

2449
02:23:56,170 --> 02:23:58,170
Yeah I think has it.

2450
02:23:58,570 --> 02:24:02,380
I gather they have like quite a bit of
a pig population enough to the point

2451
02:24:02,381 --> 02:24:07,030
where you know people go out there and
go out there and like you know do a

2452
02:24:07,450 --> 02:24:09,820
guided pig on.
They do this throughout the year.

2453
02:24:10,020 --> 02:24:12,850
So if there were none there
wouldn't be that way. Right.

2454
02:24:13,390 --> 02:24:17,950
And oftentimes when I've hunted pigs I've
found that you know it is like there's

2455
02:24:17,951 --> 02:24:21,640
so much more for and you know like a deer
go on a deer never use that word in my

2456
02:24:21,641 --> 02:24:24,400
life. What is that word mean for
kind. They have a lot of babies.

2457
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:29,320
So I could take a look at another animal
native animal around here and be like

2458
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:32,170
you know black tailed does
have to do with the premise.

2459
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:36,690
Fuck it start with fucking the
kind of comedy kind of VCU and.

2460
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:40,810
So like for comedy is
good at making babies.

2461
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:46,080
Yeah it seems like and the rude as fuck
dear someone's line you know and have

2462
02:24:46,391 --> 02:24:47,710
one or two a year right.

2463
02:24:48,430 --> 02:24:53,430
That pig's gonna a female pigs and keep
kicking off litters of you know six 10

2464
02:24:54,940 --> 02:24:58,440
several times a year.
What a powerful animal too.

2465
02:24:58,570 --> 02:25:01,320
If they're I mean they're
really they're really smart.

2466
02:25:01,420 --> 02:25:02,253
I mean they've

2467
02:25:03,970 --> 02:25:08,970
gotten they've through our
you know through them trying
to put together an idea

2468
02:25:09,581 --> 02:25:13,020
it's not actually that
complicated thanks to us.

2469
02:25:13,650 --> 02:25:17,910
And in spite of us at the same time
they've managed to get everywhere.

2470
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:22,180
You know like oftentimes we just do it
like we thought was a good idea for a

2471
02:25:22,181 --> 02:25:23,680
long time.
You go put pigs everywhere.

2472
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:27,910
Now we're like maybe it wasn't such a
good idea to put pigs everywhere and and

2473
02:25:28,570 --> 02:25:32,170
you know there's not a lot we're doing
to stop them. That's not the case here.

2474
02:25:32,230 --> 02:25:33,970
Like in California they treated
more like a game animal.

2475
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:39,100
You know the number like when people
travel more people travel to California to

2476
02:25:39,101 --> 02:25:41,400
hunt wild pigs and anything else really.

2477
02:25:41,790 --> 02:25:46,790
And they just don't seem to really cause
the level of damage and hysteria that

2478
02:25:48,011 --> 02:25:51,570
they do in some other areas like it
like in you know certain areas in the

2479
02:25:51,580 --> 02:25:54,490
southeast and the Gulf Coast area.

2480
02:25:54,580 --> 02:25:58,330
I mean there's pigs the point where
it just is really hard on agricultural

2481
02:25:58,331 --> 02:26:03,331
interests and it's kind of inexplicable
how they seem to be there for so long

2482
02:26:03,971 --> 02:26:05,530
and explode into some level.

2483
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:08,950
But in California just bend and just
bend there's some pigs around and people

2484
02:26:08,951 --> 02:26:10,480
generally appreciate them.

2485
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:14,900
I used to hunt pigs at night used to.
I still do.

2486
02:26:14,930 --> 02:26:16,640
But I have a friend who's got some.

2487
02:26:16,910 --> 02:26:20,390
Her family has some cattle ranches up
around Sacramento and he's kind of got

2488
02:26:20,391 --> 02:26:21,190
this little bit like yeah.

2489
02:26:21,190 --> 02:26:24,980
You know sometimes I get too many and I
need to get rid of some but then we'll

2490
02:26:24,981 --> 02:26:29,030
get a dry year and they'll all go away
anyway and I'd like it if you went out

2491
02:26:29,031 --> 02:26:32,930
and shot some if you see one shoot one
for me and they kind of are causing me a

2492
02:26:32,931 --> 02:26:36,170
little bit of problems. And you can
tell it has its conflicted relationship.

2493
02:26:36,740 --> 02:26:41,740
But I put it to him one day I said Glenn
if you could shake a magic wand and all

2494
02:26:42,531 --> 02:26:44,930
the wild pigs would be
gone would you shake it.

2495
02:26:45,290 --> 02:26:49,700
No you know so he even
admitted like they're a hassle.

2496
02:26:50,030 --> 02:26:51,740
He doesn't want a lot of them around.

2497
02:26:51,790 --> 02:26:53,420
But he would never want
to see them all gone.

2498
02:26:53,870 --> 02:26:57,480
You know and it feels kind of like
the relay. It's a great general.

2499
02:26:57,620 --> 02:26:58,700
It's a huge generalization.

2500
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:01,630
I feel like that's kind of been the
relationship is a lot of hunters.

2501
02:27:01,910 --> 02:27:06,200
I get all kinds of e-mails from guys
live in California and they're like they

2502
02:27:06,201 --> 02:27:10,490
went out pig hunting six times everyone
saw a pig you know hunting on public

2503
02:27:10,491 --> 02:27:15,491
ground and these guys I wish there was
more of them in and in other parts of the

2504
02:27:15,741 --> 02:27:16,250
country.

2505
02:27:16,250 --> 02:27:21,250
You got government agencies paying real
money to try to wipe them out because

2506
02:27:21,291 --> 02:27:24,770
they caused such a problem with native
species and agricultural interests and

2507
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:27,800
you know. But here it's just a it's
a different vibe in California.

2508
02:27:27,890 --> 02:27:30,770
Have you seen the pig
man Ted Nugent footage.

2509
02:27:31,010 --> 02:27:32,630
I've seen clips of it I haven't seen it.

2510
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:34,870
I mean I know everything
I know so much about.

2511
02:27:34,910 --> 02:27:36,470
I mean I have shown that network you know.

2512
02:27:36,530 --> 02:27:39,860
Yeah. They shoot for folks or just listen
and not know what we're talking about.

2513
02:27:39,950 --> 02:27:43,670
They have pig man has a couple
of episodes called a pork lips.

2514
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:47,390
You know where they shoot pigs
out a helicopters. Lots of them.

2515
02:27:47,450 --> 02:27:50,180
He shot one with a bow and arrow
out of a helicopter. Did he kill it.

2516
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:53,110
Yeah I saw that. Yeah. I mean I
I knew that it happened I know.

2517
02:27:53,190 --> 02:27:55,940
I didn't know it came to be
that he got it and got it.

2518
02:27:56,150 --> 02:28:01,150
We had to aim way high because the the
downdraft of the blade shove an arrow to

2519
02:28:01,450 --> 02:28:03,340
have the arrow down so I had to judge it.

2520
02:28:03,570 --> 02:28:08,150
Know I heard recently I heard that they're
in the situation learned to be like

2521
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:11,630
paying people by the hour to kill pigs.

2522
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:16,210
Yeah I would imagine. I mean they have
millions of pigs in Texas apparently.

2523
02:28:16,260 --> 02:28:18,290
Well they have a lot of
farmland in Texas too.

2524
02:28:19,130 --> 02:28:22,940
But they're it's it's
a weird thing about it.

2525
02:28:24,570 --> 02:28:26,950
The endangers like not
the endangered species.

2526
02:28:27,430 --> 02:28:32,310
A weird thing about stuff like pigs
and how you know just so I don't.

2527
02:28:32,530 --> 02:28:34,070
I'm sure your viewers if
someone up to speed on this.

2528
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:38,200
But wild pigs are not from North we don't
have wild pigs are not native to North

2529
02:28:38,201 --> 02:28:40,840
America.
People brought wild pigs to North America.

2530
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:46,540
Early on in the pioneer days or during
the current years contact years they

2531
02:28:46,541 --> 02:28:51,460
brought pigs to North America from their
native and your Asia brought them here

2532
02:28:51,461 --> 02:28:56,440
as a food source and they would keep some
in pens and other people would have a

2533
02:28:56,441 --> 02:29:00,640
practice where you go into an area and
you just kind of turn pigs out they

2534
02:29:00,641 --> 02:29:04,660
wouldn't scatter too far they'd fatten
themselves on acorns and masked and grubs

2535
02:29:04,661 --> 02:29:05,500
and various things.

2536
02:29:05,830 --> 02:29:09,130
And when you want and when you could
take your rifle out and find a couple and

2537
02:29:09,131 --> 02:29:13,870
shoot them it was a way to to produce
meat where it wasn't you weren't needing

2538
02:29:13,871 --> 02:29:15,070
to provide it with all of its feed.

2539
02:29:15,210 --> 02:29:18,400
It's a very sturdy animal that
could fatten itself on land.

2540
02:29:18,760 --> 02:29:20,650
And inevitably these pigs would get away.

2541
02:29:21,130 --> 02:29:26,130
So we've had wild pigs here about as long
as we have to have had Europeans here

2542
02:29:28,620 --> 02:29:32,610
another version happened later where
people brought them in as a game species

2543
02:29:32,611 --> 02:29:34,700
and when they would bring them into the
game species they would bring them in

2544
02:29:34,701 --> 02:29:39,701
from you know like Siberia and other
areas where you still had the original

2545
02:29:40,971 --> 02:29:41,650
stock.

2546
02:29:41,650 --> 02:29:46,650
So the original Sioux scrap it was like
what we call the Eurasian wild boar they

2547
02:29:47,191 --> 02:29:51,960
had been bringing in domestic versions
that had been bred off the Arabian wild

2548
02:29:51,961 --> 02:29:54,510
boar and then people brought
directly in the wild boar.

2549
02:29:55,050 --> 02:29:58,620
Now if you look for a parallel with cattle
like the ancestral cattle Zain and we

2550
02:29:58,621 --> 02:30:00,570
now call the oryx but
the oryx went extinct.

2551
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:04,980
So we lost the wild version but retained
the domestic version with pigs we had

2552
02:30:04,981 --> 02:30:07,560
the domestic version that we
humans created over long long.

2553
02:30:07,620 --> 02:30:11,220
Tens of thousands years
coexisting with the wild version.

2554
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:15,250
So people brought wild ones in Boston
in New Hampshire in the late eighteen

2555
02:30:15,260 --> 02:30:18,060
hundreds or early nineteen hundreds.
They brought them to California.

2556
02:30:18,330 --> 02:30:23,330
Around that time and kind of put them
out on the land as a thing to hunt and in

2557
02:30:23,491 --> 02:30:27,480
time we now have populations
that are of domestic stock.

2558
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:31,650
We have populations that are Eurasian
stocks so they look like a real souped up

2559
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:35,470
European wild boar. And we have
populations that are various hybrids.

2560
02:30:35,550 --> 02:30:39,690
They demonstrate different degrees of it
and they've been around a long time and

2561
02:30:39,691 --> 02:30:41,070
in some areas there's way too many.

2562
02:30:41,490 --> 02:30:45,900
The trouble with some like
that one troublesome thing
that hams mean against it

2563
02:30:45,900 --> 02:30:49,770
is complicated as shootin
rhinos to save rhinos is it.

2564
02:30:49,980 --> 02:30:53,670
We've always had we've
had over the last you know

2565
02:30:55,470 --> 02:30:59,310
150 years we've been developing like
this this set of ethics like what's an

2566
02:30:59,311 --> 02:31:02,550
acceptable what are acceptable
practices to use when hunting.

2567
02:31:03,150 --> 02:31:07,050
And we made a general determination that
certain things aren't acceptable like

2568
02:31:07,080 --> 02:31:09,810
you know we don't Jack like deer like
you can't use spotlights to go out and

2569
02:31:09,811 --> 02:31:10,644
shoot deer at night.

2570
02:31:10,860 --> 02:31:14,770
We've built up these rules because we
have ideas about what's sporting what

2571
02:31:14,810 --> 02:31:18,780
what's the elements of fair chase
also what leads to too much harvest.

2572
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:24,260
So if you make it too easy to go get
animals then you're going to have shorter

2573
02:31:25,321 --> 02:31:28,560
seasons you're going to have
fewer available tags you know.

2574
02:31:28,590 --> 02:31:33,210
And so they kind of balanced technology
to sort of make it that you're going to

2575
02:31:33,211 --> 02:31:36,300
have whatever success rate
like a lot of outcomes.

2576
02:31:36,330 --> 02:31:40,080
Only 10 percent of the hunters that
participate in the election are successful

2577
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:44,670
90 percent are unsuccessful because
we have rules in place that make it

2578
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:49,170
difficult to do to hunt
there's so many pigs now.

2579
02:31:49,620 --> 02:31:54,150
In some places that we're like discarding
a lot of that we have to do in dealing

2580
02:31:54,151 --> 02:31:58,320
with that species we're discarding a
lot of the notions that we've held dear

2581
02:31:58,830 --> 02:32:01,980
like you would never go out
in a helicopter and shoot
deer it would never be

2582
02:32:01,981 --> 02:32:05,100
legal it would be frowned on by
everybody in the hunting community.

2583
02:32:05,400 --> 02:32:08,630
But with pigs it's like an exception
because it's a non-native animal that we

2584
02:32:08,631 --> 02:32:09,464
want to get rid of.

2585
02:32:09,570 --> 02:32:13,440
And so it really is like it becomes kind
of a cloudy issue like when we're doing

2586
02:32:13,441 --> 02:32:18,210
these like big game hunting practices
that we worked hard to get rid of in order

2587
02:32:18,211 --> 02:32:22,320
to save North American wildlife from
the pits where we had driven it in the

2588
02:32:22,321 --> 02:32:27,321
early 90s hundreds and now like all these
like ethical practices are not really

2589
02:32:29,170 --> 02:32:30,340
applicable to this animal.

2590
02:32:30,910 --> 02:32:35,910
So you see some things in season things
happen like your initial reaction is

2591
02:32:36,490 --> 02:32:40,810
like Oh man it's just like ugly you
know it's ugly but the like but it's a

2592
02:32:40,811 --> 02:32:41,980
really complicated situation.

2593
02:32:42,280 --> 02:32:46,450
There's a ton of pigs causing a ton of
economic damage and it's really putting a

2594
02:32:46,451 --> 02:32:50,500
hurt on people and it's putting a hurt
on native species to you know like we

2595
02:32:50,501 --> 02:32:55,240
lose like Hawaii lost ground nesting
birds many species of wild ground nesting

2596
02:32:55,241 --> 02:32:59,300
birds because of pigs and rats.
Introduce species. Eat the eggs. Yeah.

2597
02:32:59,380 --> 02:33:00,220
Pigs are really hard.

2598
02:33:00,610 --> 02:33:04,810
There is like you know rare bird
preserves in Florida where the number one

2599
02:33:04,811 --> 02:33:08,770
problem to have those preserves is pigs
eat all their eggs because these are

2600
02:33:08,771 --> 02:33:11,500
ground nesting birds and
pigs just vacuum them up.

2601
02:33:11,770 --> 02:33:15,760
So you bring like kind of these like
practices that strike someone who grew up

2602
02:33:15,761 --> 02:33:20,470
in the in the American hunting tradition
and it's like oh man you know I've even

2603
02:33:20,471 --> 02:33:23,610
engage in some things like I've done
to pigs I've done things that wild pigs

2604
02:33:23,611 --> 02:33:25,600
that I wouldn't do to any
other animal like what.

2605
02:33:26,470 --> 02:33:30,190
I mean like running you know running
the dogs and Coleman knives and digging

2606
02:33:30,191 --> 02:33:34,600
them out of holes and chasing them in a
little fenced enclosures and kill them

2607
02:33:34,601 --> 02:33:39,601
in there and you know it's like it's
their legitimate honest problem.

2608
02:33:40,410 --> 02:33:44,030
Well you're your last show that
I watched last night actually.

2609
02:33:44,390 --> 02:33:45,980
You had a pig.

2610
02:33:46,510 --> 02:33:51,510
It was a whole head to hoof pig cooking
wild pig cooking special was really fun

2611
02:33:52,311 --> 02:33:53,770
special.
Very interesting yeah.

2612
02:33:53,960 --> 02:33:57,380
Very educational I heard a story of that
pig. Yeah the pig had his balls removed.

2613
02:33:57,410 --> 02:33:57,690
Yeah.

2614
02:33:57,690 --> 02:34:02,690
So this is crazy I'd gone down to
Florida hunting turkeys and we have the

2615
02:34:03,291 --> 02:34:06,290
American there's like but multiple
subspecies of the American Turkey.

2616
02:34:06,350 --> 02:34:10,110
So we have it's all one species but
there's subspecies or varieties you have

2617
02:34:10,130 --> 02:34:15,130
like the Eastern Wild Turkey and most
of the east the Osceola Turkey which was

2618
02:34:15,531 --> 02:34:17,390
in the south half of
the Florida Peninsula.

2619
02:34:17,690 --> 02:34:22,030
Then you have the Rio Grande Turkey
Miriam's Turkey the ghouls Turkey and

2620
02:34:22,031 --> 02:34:23,810
northern Mexico southern Arizona.

2621
02:34:24,230 --> 02:34:29,230
And if you're like a turkey geek you
might want to try to eventually get all

2622
02:34:30,020 --> 02:34:33,350
have the experience of hunting all Turkey
subspecies I kind of accidentally got

2623
02:34:33,351 --> 02:34:36,440
four of them and I realized that I want
to go to South Florida and have a chance

2624
02:34:36,441 --> 02:34:37,230
to hunt as the oldest.

2625
02:34:37,230 --> 02:34:40,580
So I went on the hunt seals down the
swamps donor and we're down there running

2626
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:45,640
these guys who hunt pigs with hounds
what they're set up is this guy has big

2627
02:34:46,171 --> 02:34:51,171
cattle ranch and it borders a rare
bird preserve and the preserve.

2628
02:34:53,320 --> 02:34:55,080
You can't even walk around and it's close.

2629
02:34:55,150 --> 02:34:58,000
Most of the preserve is closed
any human visitation at all. Cane.

2630
02:34:58,180 --> 02:35:02,130
Take a walk through there but they have
guys like full time pig hunting here.

2631
02:35:02,320 --> 02:35:07,160
He goes around and kills pigs as a way
to try to protect these rare bird species

2632
02:35:07,161 --> 02:35:08,950
to give them nesting opportunities.

2633
02:35:09,610 --> 02:35:14,530
The rancher who likes to hunt wild hogs
goes and he usually kind of hunts along

2634
02:35:14,531 --> 02:35:17,590
his border with the preserve because
the pigs will come out of the swamps and

2635
02:35:17,591 --> 02:35:22,591
the preserve and come up and hunt on his
route around on his land in the cover

2636
02:35:22,931 --> 02:35:26,770
of night and then retreat back into the
preserve where they're relatively safe

2637
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:27,633
and hide out.

2638
02:35:28,030 --> 02:35:32,920
So what he realized is he went through
and put this fence in and put trap doors

2639
02:35:32,921 --> 02:35:37,921
one way doors in his fence so that pigs
could leave the preserve and enter his

2640
02:35:38,591 --> 02:35:41,140
fence.
But then they couldn't get back out.

2641
02:35:41,170 --> 02:35:42,760
It was like it was like a fish trap door.

2642
02:35:43,720 --> 02:35:47,170
So now and then if he gets the itch and
to go pig hunting he'll go out at four

2643
02:35:47,171 --> 02:35:51,340
in the morning and make sure all the
doors are shut like closes the door is up

2644
02:35:51,350 --> 02:35:53,080
so the pigs can't get back
through the other way.

2645
02:35:53,890 --> 02:35:56,080
And then he knows they're
probably somewhere on his ranch.

2646
02:35:56,170 --> 02:35:59,380
And when he starts chasing when his
hounds they won't be able to make it back

2647
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:01,300
into their safety in the preserve.

2648
02:36:01,870 --> 02:36:06,870
And when he goes out if he gets a boar
like an old boar Scott is not intact.

2649
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:12,140
He knows it's not going to be a great
eating board because they just they run

2650
02:36:12,141 --> 02:36:14,630
themselves right. You know they're
not like they don't have a lot of fat.

2651
02:36:14,660 --> 02:36:16,310
They're full of hormones.

2652
02:36:16,370 --> 02:36:19,090
They're not at they're certainly
edible but not as good eating.

2653
02:36:19,190 --> 02:36:23,990
So what he'll do is he'll do
something that benefits everyone.

2654
02:36:24,110 --> 02:36:25,700
He will castrate that hard

2655
02:36:27,610 --> 02:36:31,170
and turn it out because now that hog
cannot contribute to the population he's

2656
02:36:31,180 --> 02:36:33,370
not a viable breeding
member of the population.

2657
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:38,940
And if he catches them again he'll
have what's called a barred hog barrel.

2658
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:41,020
What was that word bear.

2659
02:36:42,590 --> 02:36:44,240
Bart Hogg which is a castrated hog.

2660
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:49,600
So like a steers a castrated you know
steers a castrated male cow castrate a

2661
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:52,820
bull in a bar dog is castrated.

2662
02:36:53,270 --> 02:36:58,270
So we went on one eye and caught a big
board was not intact castrated him and

2663
02:36:59,091 --> 02:37:02,960
turned him out so he could as this guy
put it it would take his mind off ass and

2664
02:37:02,961 --> 02:37:04,070
put on the grass

2665
02:37:05,870 --> 02:37:08,060
and then we stayed out caught another pig.

2666
02:37:08,600 --> 02:37:12,770
And this one had at some point in time
they didn't know if they had it or

2667
02:37:12,771 --> 02:37:14,870
another guy had done this
one had been castrated.

2668
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:16,740
You need to known as totally healed up.

2669
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:20,030
But he had me castrated those guys
like that'll be a good one to eat.

2670
02:37:20,870 --> 02:37:23,300
So we kill that hog and kept it for food

2671
02:37:24,890 --> 02:37:27,150
and we ate that thing
from from honest to God.

2672
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:32,200
We ate it skin as pork rinds took its
intestines out and flushed the intestines

2673
02:37:33,191 --> 02:37:38,191
and stripped and made our own sausage
casings liver heart it is nose in head

2674
02:37:39,431 --> 02:37:43,210
cheese eight feet by eight
every part of that hard.

2675
02:37:43,660 --> 02:37:46,820
Yeah. The guy actually is the one thing
I got left is one of the good parts.

2676
02:37:46,840 --> 02:37:50,830
I got one back leg frozen.
I want him in my freezer.

2677
02:37:50,890 --> 02:37:53,590
I didn't know what head cheese was.
I didn't narrow hall.

2678
02:37:53,690 --> 02:37:56,050
That's the word I'm
good arrow Beryl Beryl.

2679
02:37:56,990 --> 02:37:58,920
Well let's look it up here.
Please read it hard.

2680
02:37:59,440 --> 02:38:01,350
I've even written the word
I wrote a thing about this.

2681
02:38:05,670 --> 02:38:10,670
What is a castrated pig
called Bard barrel bear hug.

2682
02:38:12,940 --> 02:38:16,280
Be a r r o w Barrow hog Barrow hog.

2683
02:38:16,640 --> 02:38:21,380
Hmm hmm. Colonel Barrow Yeah. B or w.

2684
02:38:21,560 --> 02:38:24,110
Yeah. These guys love to
hunt. They love to eat pigs.

2685
02:38:24,980 --> 02:38:28,100
D It's a good little system they
got the head cheese was so weird.

2686
02:38:28,130 --> 02:38:32,060
I never I'd heard that name
before word description.

2687
02:38:32,330 --> 02:38:34,430
I didn't know what it was.
It's like a gelatin.

2688
02:38:34,550 --> 02:38:37,490
You know I made head cheese with the
first the first wild pig I ever was in

2689
02:38:37,491 --> 02:38:38,324
California.

2690
02:38:39,290 --> 02:38:43,340
I went out to hunt wild pigs and I had
never laid eyes on a wild pig and I don't

2691
02:38:43,341 --> 02:38:44,750
want to shoot the first wild pig I saw.

2692
02:38:44,780 --> 02:38:48,170
So I went out one day without my
rifle just to see some wild pigs.

2693
02:38:48,590 --> 02:38:49,760
And the next day I went out and got one.

2694
02:38:49,820 --> 02:38:53,290
I want to make head cheese
with it where it's not.

2695
02:38:53,560 --> 02:38:57,220
It doesn't make it cheese was like
gelatinous so a lot of the cuts.

2696
02:38:57,250 --> 02:38:59,500
Like when you put your name
a lot of the cuts that are

2697
02:39:01,240 --> 02:39:04,110
too weird you know that don't really
make great steak. They're not that way.

2698
02:39:04,220 --> 02:39:09,220
They have a lot of connective tissue
you know and fatty deposit levels have

2699
02:39:09,251 --> 02:39:12,070
something like terms in the college and
when you cook it like it turns in like a

2700
02:39:12,071 --> 02:39:16,500
gelatin when you cook it. So a head's
full that stuff in the bones have it.

2701
02:39:16,580 --> 02:39:18,850
And so you simmer that
head for a long long time.

2702
02:39:19,180 --> 02:39:23,080
Eventually can pick off all meat and a
lot of the gristle and connective tissue

2703
02:39:23,081 --> 02:39:27,010
and stuff turns into like a gelatin
like substance you can make real gelatin

2704
02:39:27,011 --> 02:39:27,310
that way.

2705
02:39:27,310 --> 02:39:31,150
And now we just have a packet reporter
powder mix of the water makes gelatin but

2706
02:39:31,151 --> 02:39:35,950
old style gelatin and natural gelatin
would be just derived from as an animal

2707
02:39:35,951 --> 02:39:36,784
byproduct.

2708
02:39:37,090 --> 02:39:41,440
So you take all the meat you pluck off
the same way like hog job well if you

2709
02:39:41,441 --> 02:39:44,140
ever had that you take the tongue
out and chop the tongue up.

2710
02:39:44,660 --> 02:39:46,410
There's all this other at Roo.

2711
02:39:46,580 --> 02:39:50,560
At when it's warm it's liquid but it sets
up as gelatin and it's just all bound

2712
02:39:50,561 --> 02:39:55,480
together with natural gelatin that you've
derived by slow cooking the pig's head.

2713
02:39:55,900 --> 02:40:00,790
So it's like little bits of pig meat
bound up in an aspic are bound up in

2714
02:40:00,791 --> 02:40:03,940
gelatin and of course you season it and
flavour it with all kinds of good stuff

2715
02:40:03,941 --> 02:40:04,660
to eat.

2716
02:40:04,660 --> 02:40:08,920
And then when you when you when it when
it sets up when it's chilled you can

2717
02:40:08,921 --> 02:40:11,320
pour it out like it looks
almost like a fruitcake.

2718
02:40:11,820 --> 02:40:16,820
You know it pours out in a mould and
then you slice it and it's not cheese.

2719
02:40:17,380 --> 02:40:20,140
It looked great.
It looked great because my body does it.

2720
02:40:20,200 --> 02:40:23,680
Yeah my body that makes it this guy
Matt Weingarten a chef I hang out with.

2721
02:40:24,520 --> 02:40:27,610
He puts all his amazing stuff in there
and he puts you know you can put like

2722
02:40:27,640 --> 02:40:32,050
colorful things and citrus he
flavours and it's beautiful.

2723
02:40:32,790 --> 02:40:35,890
One of the things I really love about
your show is that they occasionally do

2724
02:40:35,891 --> 02:40:39,700
show like recipes and how to cook but
also that you butcher the animals that you

2725
02:40:39,701 --> 02:40:42,730
cut quarter the animals got them.
You do all that on the show.

2726
02:40:42,760 --> 02:40:45,730
You don't see why you see whales up on
the show that you don't see on other

2727
02:40:45,731 --> 02:40:47,050
stuff.
Now we have a trip.

2728
02:40:47,080 --> 02:40:52,080
It's like it's amazing how much liberty
like how much liberty we have like how

2729
02:40:54,071 --> 02:40:56,890
much the network lets us get away with
is it because it's on the Sportsman

2730
02:40:56,891 --> 02:40:57,850
Channel because you can.

2731
02:40:57,900 --> 02:41:02,110
Yeah there's another there's a there's
another channel that shows on shows they

2732
02:41:02,111 --> 02:41:05,140
won't let the people have bloody hands.
What show is that.

2733
02:41:06,070 --> 02:41:10,270
My understanding is not a show there's
there's a network I've heard that that.

2734
02:41:10,330 --> 02:41:11,650
Yeah there is another hunting network.

2735
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:13,810
I've heard it it's protocol on other
hunting networks you're not supposed to

2736
02:41:13,811 --> 02:41:15,700
have bloody hands like you
won't see him got animals.

2737
02:41:16,060 --> 02:41:20,160
That's ridiculous because they think
that to make people turned off by hunting

2738
02:41:20,161 --> 02:41:23,650
is like how you think people get turned
off by hunting by seeing people eat what

2739
02:41:23,651 --> 02:41:24,820
they hunt is beyond me.

2740
02:41:25,490 --> 02:41:28,030
But sportsman channel is really
cool because they let us do stuff.

2741
02:41:28,210 --> 02:41:31,690
I mean in it it works the advantage is
people like you know what. I get it man.

2742
02:41:32,080 --> 02:41:35,350
You know it's like you're showing like
a thing that most people are hiding from

2743
02:41:35,351 --> 02:41:40,300
but it's the reality that meat goes
through a metamorphosis you know to get

2744
02:41:40,301 --> 02:41:42,880
there and then it's sometimes gory
so yeah we get to show all that.

2745
02:41:43,060 --> 02:41:47,320
And I love it but I don't think
of it as just like gratuitous.

2746
02:41:47,440 --> 02:41:49,800
No it's like it's instructional really.

2747
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:51,580
Yes yeah.
That's that's how I feel.

2748
02:41:51,640 --> 02:41:55,360
I don't I don't feel it's gratuitous at
all but I think I like watching you like

2749
02:41:55,361 --> 02:42:00,230
when you eat that mousse. I like watching
guys cut it up and then eat it. Now

2750
02:42:00,430 --> 02:42:04,270
that me it was like on believable man
we had that marrow cracked the marrow

2751
02:42:04,271 --> 02:42:09,130
bones open to working with the marrow on
deck and believable like that meat was

2752
02:42:09,131 --> 02:42:14,131
so tender and good and you know getting
the thing realized when you're on TV you

2753
02:42:15,051 --> 02:42:18,900
know you suppose you know you watch like
morning shows and they have a cooking

2754
02:42:18,901 --> 02:42:22,470
segment. The host is like oh
it's so good. Oh it's so good.

2755
02:42:22,950 --> 02:42:25,080
You know sometimes I cook
something so it's not good.

2756
02:42:25,440 --> 02:42:27,630
And I just try to be like That's
not good at karaoke. Yeah.

2757
02:42:27,890 --> 02:42:31,650
You know it's not that great because I
want it to be that when it when something

2758
02:42:31,651 --> 02:42:34,410
is good I feel like I want you
to believe me. And that was good.

2759
02:42:34,650 --> 02:42:38,430
It was just a phenomenal moves me looked
unbelievably delicious Elks widely

2760
02:42:38,431 --> 02:42:42,390
regarded as like if you went to survey
people who've tasted a wide variety meats

2761
02:42:42,810 --> 02:42:45,960
elk is the one that you would be like
it's the best one where we're going.

2762
02:42:46,290 --> 02:42:48,970
Deon has elk on it Tulio.
Yeah.

2763
02:42:49,180 --> 02:42:53,110
You know you got like Roosevelt elk Rocky
Mount all these different subspecies

2764
02:42:53,111 --> 02:42:57,760
elk is a very rare one in California
not rare but yeah rare and a very small

2765
02:42:57,761 --> 02:43:00,490
range that was almost wiped down.

2766
02:43:00,790 --> 02:43:04,570
It's back now because you have like big
chunks of property like that where they

2767
02:43:04,571 --> 02:43:09,120
can find you know find some refuge and
people are working to maintain them

2768
02:43:09,130 --> 02:43:12,640
provide habitat forms so it's kind of
cool spot you go there and see a elk that

2769
02:43:12,641 --> 02:43:13,520
most people have seen.

2770
02:43:14,350 --> 02:43:18,460
I hope I hope we run into one this is
like a two the two the elk you know do you

2771
02:43:18,461 --> 02:43:23,430
feel like the moose was right up
there with elk it was I'm not joking.

2772
02:43:23,450 --> 02:43:26,730
It was one of the best pieces of
meat I eat and eat meat in the field.

2773
02:43:27,260 --> 02:43:30,990
You know we age mix it tenderizer you
know and we're eating meat like fresh meat

2774
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:34,110
often tastes like art where
you eat some fresh meat rich.

2775
02:43:34,380 --> 02:43:36,160
There's like a onion kind of thing to it.

2776
02:43:36,390 --> 02:43:38,850
It just doesn't quite taste like age meat.
I like that.

2777
02:43:38,910 --> 02:43:41,730
But when we're Wisconsin man we're
you're cooking those steaks and it is

2778
02:43:41,731 --> 02:43:44,400
phenomenal. Yeah so so but
sometimes it's pretty tough.

2779
02:43:44,650 --> 02:43:47,340
Like my brother Eric my brother
my brother lives in Alaska.

2780
02:43:47,370 --> 02:43:50,580
He kills moose every year. Like the
guy that kills moose is moose all year.

2781
02:43:50,790 --> 02:43:53,130
He's a moose snob but he won't
hunt a lot of stuff you like.

2782
02:43:53,190 --> 02:43:56,850
He likes to hunt moves and all sheep
because moose is good but he puts a moose

2783
02:43:56,851 --> 02:44:00,930
in his freezer because just because
he doesn't have a hanging you know he

2784
02:44:00,931 --> 02:44:03,510
doesn't have a lock or
he can dry age his meat.

2785
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:06,450
He'll kill a moose and tip because
of weather and bugs and other issues.

2786
02:44:06,750 --> 02:44:11,640
He comes home and right away processes
his moose and puts in his freezer and he

2787
02:44:11,641 --> 02:44:15,990
don't usually touch that thing for six
months because it will slowly age like

2788
02:44:15,991 --> 02:44:18,270
meat will tend to rise in
your freezer over time.

2789
02:44:19,020 --> 02:44:22,050
So when he calculates his a year out
he knows he's going to kill a moose in

2790
02:44:22,051 --> 02:44:22,800
September.

2791
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:26,880
He doesn't plan on having the one he
killed before be gone in September.

2792
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:29,450
He plans on having the one
he killed before begone.

2793
02:44:30,030 --> 02:44:34,920
No it's staggered so the one that he
kills he lets it slowly age in his freezer

2794
02:44:34,921 --> 02:44:37,710
and it will tend to rise in your freezer
over time and then he starts in on the

2795
02:44:37,711 --> 02:44:41,190
new one. So when he kills moose he so
eat in the moose from the year before.

2796
02:44:41,670 --> 02:44:44,100
That seems so weird because
you way you eat that moose.

2797
02:44:44,140 --> 02:44:47,340
It didn't seem like you needed anything
at all because it was an exceptional

2798
02:44:47,341 --> 02:44:49,770
animal.
So that's unusual.

2799
02:44:49,820 --> 02:44:50,653
It's yeah.

2800
02:44:50,940 --> 02:44:55,940
Those animals like most animals especially
males and bowls like most animals not

2801
02:44:56,551 --> 02:45:01,551
most animals benefit like like
undulate benefit from aging.

2802
02:45:02,100 --> 02:45:07,100
No one age you know age wild pigs you
know you don't age black bears a lot of

2803
02:45:07,471 --> 02:45:11,850
critters you do age deer l moose it all
benefits those animals all benefit from

2804
02:45:11,851 --> 02:45:12,250
aging.

2805
02:45:12,250 --> 02:45:16,500
There's natural you know there's natural
enzymes whatever that the process is

2806
02:45:16,501 --> 02:45:18,380
well understood.
I don't understand really well.

2807
02:45:18,860 --> 02:45:22,020
It's well understood that you hang
it there is like a natural decay.

2808
02:45:22,540 --> 02:45:24,510
You know I'll put Doc say if I killed Doug

2809
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:31,120
I've got the Doug if I have like a wife
or if I have a girlfriend or whoever

2810
02:45:31,931 --> 02:45:36,610
doesn't want it or when I had my chance
say Forget it I've got the duck put in

2811
02:45:36,611 --> 02:45:39,700
the fridge now I might need to put it
in a paper bag because someone might not

2812
02:45:39,701 --> 02:45:43,210
want to see the duck every time they
open the fridge but all rolled up in a

2813
02:45:43,211 --> 02:45:46,000
paper bag or of still breathing I'll put
in my fridge and I'll leave it in there

2814
02:45:46,001 --> 02:45:51,001
a long time I might leave it in there
ten days and that meat gets to where you

2815
02:45:53,391 --> 02:45:58,100
could scrape it away with your thumb
you know the inside that gutting this is

2816
02:45:58,101 --> 02:46:01,790
where you've got to the burden might
start to even smell a little off but the

2817
02:46:01,791 --> 02:46:06,770
meat is getting just perfect you know
increase the flavor enhances it gets more

2818
02:46:06,771 --> 02:46:10,500
tender just like aging you know it's
a Why was that move so good then.

2819
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:12,920
I don't know just what
it was eating just good.

2820
02:46:13,400 --> 02:46:16,970
I've had part I mean we had we had a great
piece off or eat it like kind of like

2821
02:46:16,971 --> 02:46:21,950
the most tender part of the rear leg
but just a great animal that there's so

2822
02:46:21,951 --> 02:46:26,951
much variability like when that's one
thing about being a wild game chef I am

2823
02:46:27,050 --> 02:46:30,470
wild game Cook I think Chef
sounds a little more formal
but I'm a wild game cook

2824
02:46:30,700 --> 02:46:34,160
and one thing about being a wild game
cook that's more challenging than me and a

2825
02:46:34,161 --> 02:46:37,910
regular Cook is you're dealing with so
much variability like you get some great

2826
02:46:37,911 --> 02:46:42,020
chef and he can do some amazing thing
because he's got a purveyor you know and

2827
02:46:42,021 --> 02:46:47,021
when he buys a pig it's like the pig a
disc for 72 days and then we hit this for

2828
02:46:47,511 --> 02:46:51,410
14 days then we killed it on this day
and chilled it at this temperature for

2829
02:46:51,411 --> 02:46:55,790
these many days and you know and every
time he buys a pig the pig comes in his

2830
02:46:55,791 --> 02:47:00,440
kitchen or his restaurant and he knows
he is nowhere is going to be like you

2831
02:47:00,441 --> 02:47:05,120
know animals you don't know what kind
of that there's age issues and what kind

2832
02:47:05,121 --> 02:47:07,960
of trip they've been on there's all
kinds of variability so you learn how to

2833
02:47:07,970 --> 02:47:12,260
kind of control that and sort of bring
the ingredients into line because some

2834
02:47:12,261 --> 02:47:13,640
animals are good and some animals aren't.

2835
02:47:14,090 --> 02:47:19,090
I shot a milder one time that was just
implied it was just disgusting to eat and

2836
02:47:19,881 --> 02:47:23,930
then you get another meal there it's like
that is so good that was the dish some

2837
02:47:23,940 --> 02:47:25,040
salmon and then some.

2838
02:47:25,100 --> 02:47:28,370
You know it's like you don't know what
they've been up to or there's just a lot

2839
02:47:28,371 --> 02:47:31,670
of mystery with it but that
moose was a phenomenal moose.

2840
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:35,630
I've also had my buddy he was
my buddy we had a falling out.

2841
02:47:35,710 --> 02:47:38,150
I told a homeless guy he killed a moose.
He brought the meat over.

2842
02:47:38,510 --> 02:47:40,310
I thought he'd kill the Loch Ness monster.

2843
02:47:41,940 --> 02:47:45,830
I was like I'd never seen anything
like it. It's just funky and nasty.

2844
02:47:45,860 --> 02:47:46,880
He had a cow tag.

2845
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:51,410
See one thing about shootin males on
antlers game is you can get an idea of age

2846
02:47:52,160 --> 02:47:56,390
the antlers betray the age there's a
growth pattern they go through like if you

2847
02:47:56,391 --> 02:48:00,500
see a fork you deer a spike on Deer
It's like that's a one and a half you'll

2848
02:48:00,501 --> 02:48:04,520
deer is gonna be great eating when you
shoot an antler lists the clues are much

2849
02:48:04,521 --> 02:48:09,480
more subtle what the guy looked at the
two though so he had a cow mustache.

2850
02:48:09,590 --> 02:48:12,330
He went on got a cow moose he later
had someone look at the teeth and they

2851
02:48:12,331 --> 02:48:15,390
estimated that thing to be 20 years old.
Oh my God.

2852
02:48:16,320 --> 02:48:19,740
It was like you couldn't really chew it
tasted like Oh they taste like Oh that

2853
02:48:19,741 --> 02:48:24,000
tastes like a sea monster I mean
because it's really hard to tell.

2854
02:48:24,050 --> 02:48:27,270
There is a guys that really know their
business like you know Doug Dern and

2855
02:48:27,271 --> 02:48:30,620
Wisconsin Doug Derek and look
at Dougherty hold it is yeah.

2856
02:48:30,780 --> 02:48:31,950
He's looked at so many damn deer.

2857
02:48:33,220 --> 02:48:35,860
He's looking to see me do
that live on his place.

2858
02:48:36,170 --> 02:48:40,210
He just knows like what their groove is
you know isn't a weird sort of symbiotic

2859
02:48:40,211 --> 02:48:44,620
relationship. Those deer have farmers like
balls almost not really a wild animal.

2860
02:48:44,650 --> 02:48:49,650
Canada geese crows whitetail
deer love people people.

2861
02:48:51,520 --> 02:48:51,760
Yeah.

2862
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:55,600
When we were at Doug's place I mean first
of all what a fucking great guy he is.

2863
02:48:56,390 --> 02:48:58,550
Doug he's one of the bad
guys one of the best.

2864
02:48:58,960 --> 02:49:03,960
And I like to say it like a big ask
I don't say this about many people.

2865
02:49:04,370 --> 02:49:08,110
I don't throw this around lightly like
he's a big hearted guy. Yeah I mean.

2866
02:49:08,830 --> 02:49:11,950
It's not something I would really think
of when I'm describing other individuals.

2867
02:49:12,130 --> 02:49:17,080
Yeah. No I'm so glad he introduced me
to him. He's awesome and it was so cool.

2868
02:49:17,410 --> 02:49:21,640
Me and me and Brian Cowan staying at
his place and you know that he let us do

2869
02:49:21,641 --> 02:49:25,120
that and film the show there and god
damn there's a lot of deer up there.

2870
02:49:25,530 --> 02:49:26,830
Jesus Christ.

2871
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:30,220
I mean we didn't see a lot of big bucks
but god damn we saw a lot of deer.

2872
02:49:30,280 --> 02:49:34,240
And you told about this I
think he did when he was a kid.

2873
02:49:34,270 --> 02:49:36,760
If you cut saw a deer track you
ran home and told your parents.

2874
02:49:37,390 --> 02:49:38,710
Wow you're in no frigging to your own.

2875
02:49:39,160 --> 02:49:43,780
Well they've they've fucking grown in
population we saw 16 the first day right.

2876
02:49:43,810 --> 02:49:45,520
We saw about 16 deer at least.

2877
02:49:45,550 --> 02:49:46,240
But I mean know.

2878
02:49:46,240 --> 02:49:51,240
Yeah I mean it's just that's like a real
deer spot but they do have the early

2879
02:49:51,700 --> 02:49:53,980
word they have a symbiotic relationship.

2880
02:49:54,370 --> 02:49:58,060
Wait til deer have really
are one of the winners.

2881
02:49:58,810 --> 02:50:01,870
When it comes to development issues and
in art like our good friend the milder

2882
02:50:01,930 --> 02:50:06,260
which is more to me like it's a more
romantic kind of mule deer and somebody

2883
02:50:06,270 --> 02:50:08,590
would be like oh yeah we have
mildew in my yard all the time.

2884
02:50:08,980 --> 02:50:13,640
I know but generally they
have they don't do as well.

2885
02:50:13,660 --> 02:50:16,990
They don't do as well with fragmentation.
They don't do as well.

2886
02:50:17,110 --> 02:50:20,530
Kind of the stress. You know they
have some things they like to eat.

2887
02:50:20,570 --> 02:50:24,160
They're kind of wed to those things we
like to eat and White tells like Oh yeah.

2888
02:50:24,430 --> 02:50:25,540
That down I'll eat corn you know.

2889
02:50:26,130 --> 02:50:27,830
They're just like they're
always gonna find some.

2890
02:50:28,090 --> 02:50:30,580
And that places is like a
deer culture down there.

2891
02:50:30,820 --> 02:50:32,860
Well there's a lot of places like
that in this country. Oh yeah.

2892
02:50:33,050 --> 02:50:37,720
Oh Lord farm lands right like Illinois
Iowa Kansas a lot of farmland.

2893
02:50:37,810 --> 02:50:41,650
Lot of crazy white tailed you get way way
way more white tailed you than you had

2894
02:50:41,651 --> 02:50:44,500
the time of European
contact way more right now.

2895
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:48,310
That's nuts but still of every dude in
America went out and shot a deer we'd be

2896
02:50:48,311 --> 02:50:52,780
running like a 200 million deer
deficit really no way. Wow.

2897
02:50:53,710 --> 02:50:56,710
So people say to me like so you think
everyone should go out and shoot their own

2898
02:50:56,711 --> 02:50:58,780
meat. I'm like well we really
couldn't we'd run on the critters.

2899
02:50:58,900 --> 02:51:01,390
It's like it's going to always
be like a fringe activity.

2900
02:51:02,490 --> 02:51:05,970
I think it's always gonna be a fringe
activity anyway as long as society keeps

2901
02:51:05,971 --> 02:51:06,804
going the way it is.

2902
02:51:06,870 --> 02:51:09,860
No no I'm not worried about that. I don't
I don't stay up at night what I might.

2903
02:51:10,010 --> 02:51:15,010
One of my goals not a goal but a thing
I'd like to see happen is rather that I

2904
02:51:15,271 --> 02:51:16,950
mean we could definitely
have more hunters.

2905
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:19,680
I think we need more does to have
political clout to defend our lifestyle.

2906
02:51:19,980 --> 02:51:24,090
But I also would like to see the people
who have no interest in hunting come to

2907
02:51:24,091 --> 02:51:28,620
Reckitt Lake through understanding kind
of the mechanics of wildlife start to

2908
02:51:28,621 --> 02:51:33,621
recognize it as that hunting is legitimate
useful practice not the opposite.

2909
02:51:35,790 --> 02:51:39,210
You know I think people that pay attention
do see that I know for the most part

2910
02:51:39,211 --> 02:51:43,500
the real issue is that most people
have this sort of periphery view of it.

2911
02:51:43,570 --> 02:51:44,940
They don't really look at it.

2912
02:51:45,030 --> 02:51:47,490
They don't get in there and try to
understand what can what is hunting what's

2913
02:51:47,491 --> 02:51:48,720
going on with it.
I know.

2914
02:51:48,750 --> 02:51:53,250
Like I said my own personal transformation
from looking at deer like why would

2915
02:51:53,251 --> 02:51:57,270
you kill a beautiful animal. Oh
you have to kill them. OK I get it.

2916
02:51:57,510 --> 02:51:59,010
You know it's understanding
what's going on.

2917
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:01,590
Oh well that actually keeps the population
say well if you don't do that they

2918
02:52:01,591 --> 02:52:02,100
run out of food.

2919
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:06,390
Well then as you know the massive strain
on the resources and there there's well

2920
02:52:06,391 --> 02:52:09,780
there's no predators in the wild
fluctuations and I didn't get it.

2921
02:52:09,900 --> 02:52:10,830
I had to look into it.

2922
02:52:10,890 --> 02:52:14,250
But when you do look into it the only
people that don't get it of the people

2923
02:52:14,251 --> 02:52:18,920
that don't want to feel whether it's
for moral political you know what.

2924
02:52:18,960 --> 02:52:22,920
Whatever reasons whatever bias you
have coming into it if you look at it

2925
02:52:22,921 --> 02:52:25,260
objectively I don't I
don't see how you could.

2926
02:52:26,310 --> 02:52:27,720
I don't see I could not get it.

2927
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:33,080
No I think anyone who looks at wildlife
politics in a way that's like immersive

2928
02:52:33,770 --> 02:52:35,010
and you have to come to understand it.

2929
02:52:36,090 --> 02:52:40,260
You go ask someone who runs a wildlife
agency like a state wildlife agency or

2930
02:52:40,261 --> 02:52:44,970
federal wildlife agency and ask them what
their job would be like without having

2931
02:52:44,971 --> 02:52:46,020
hunting as a tool.

2932
02:52:46,650 --> 02:52:51,650
And you know it would make them shudder
because you just you know it's so much

2933
02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:55,050
it's gonna be very difficult to maintain

2934
02:52:57,260 --> 02:53:01,710
the kind of the portfolio of different
species we have at the levels we have.

2935
02:53:01,730 --> 02:53:02,270
You're gonna have to be.

2936
02:53:02,270 --> 02:53:05,660
You'd have to be open to having really
wild fluctuations having cycles of

2937
02:53:05,661 --> 02:53:09,140
disease and things that aren't as pretty.
And also why.

2938
02:53:09,170 --> 02:53:14,170
Like why deny ourselves access to a
renewable resource that generates so much

2939
02:53:15,261 --> 02:53:18,320
revenue.
It generates economic activity.

2940
02:53:18,530 --> 02:53:21,020
It pay it's self-sustaining
helps pay for itself.

2941
02:53:21,740 --> 02:53:22,573
And it's fun.

2942
02:53:22,940 --> 02:53:26,120
People don't want to say that for whatever
reason they don't say killing animals

2943
02:53:26,121 --> 02:53:30,050
is fun. Seems like it's a mean thing
to say now. I love Hunt man it's fun.

2944
02:53:30,680 --> 02:53:33,220
I always say that it's not
you're not being mean. It's not.

2945
02:53:33,290 --> 02:53:37,010
It's an exciting activity
that speaks to your DNA.

2946
02:53:37,400 --> 02:53:40,130
I always tell people I wouldn't because
I heart like I'll talk about the food

2947
02:53:40,131 --> 02:53:43,040
element of it.
I wouldn't hunt if it wasn't for the food.

2948
02:53:43,400 --> 02:53:44,720
I wouldn't hunt if it wasn't for the fun.

2949
02:53:45,260 --> 02:53:49,130
Yeah you know I mean it's it's both it's
exciting and you could watch the meat

2950
02:53:49,131 --> 02:53:49,940
eater online now.

2951
02:53:49,940 --> 02:53:53,540
Finally you pay for them for the longest
time and you only get them on DVD.

2952
02:53:53,570 --> 02:53:58,570
But now if you go to meat eater dot VH
X dot tv or go to the meat eater dot com

2953
02:54:00,380 --> 02:54:01,213
you can get them.

2954
02:54:01,250 --> 02:54:05,600
They're selling them as a bundle and
volume 4 is the bundle that the two part

2955
02:54:05,630 --> 02:54:10,630
episode with me and Brian Cowan in
Montana I should say Brian Callen and I.

2956
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:12,800
And if you use the code word rogue.

2957
02:54:12,890 --> 02:54:14,240
No no you shouldn't say that.
No.

2958
02:54:14,700 --> 02:54:17,750
Was just picture that you're saying
it without Callen what would you say.

2959
02:54:18,890 --> 02:54:23,890
Brian Cowen and I know no picture saying
you wouldn't say it features I Brian

2960
02:54:23,970 --> 02:54:24,410
calendar.

2961
02:54:24,410 --> 02:54:26,720
Me I would say Brian Cowen and me.
Yes.

2962
02:54:26,780 --> 02:54:29,330
Picture what you'd say without
the other guy there. Right right.

2963
02:54:29,450 --> 02:54:32,740
You would say me you'd say me but
you would say him first. Right yeah.

2964
02:54:32,930 --> 02:54:34,640
But I'm talking with my eye OK OK.

2965
02:54:35,060 --> 02:54:38,540
I meant I was just saying the I was just
trying to put him all you're worried

2966
02:54:38,541 --> 02:54:41,440
about the sequence not the
pronoun not the pronoun you.

2967
02:54:41,780 --> 02:54:45,110
Yeah yeah you're correct though means the
right way say I fucked that up all the

2968
02:54:45,111 --> 02:54:45,500
time.

2969
02:54:45,500 --> 02:54:48,490
I don't pay attention to I know
the rule but I don't care about it.

2970
02:54:48,910 --> 02:54:52,730
I ain't concerned with it.
You ain't volume for.

2971
02:54:52,760 --> 02:54:56,060
Use the code word rogue and
get them although it's a
great fucking show it's not

2972
02:54:56,061 --> 02:54:58,040
just a great hunting
show it's a great show.

2973
02:54:58,340 --> 02:55:01,010
You know I was saying that to my wife
the other day while I was watching I was

2974
02:55:01,011 --> 02:55:04,130
like this show it's almost
like I want more people see it.

2975
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:09,200
Well I wish more people
would see it because it would
open their eyes as to your

2976
02:55:09,201 --> 02:55:10,560
approach your.

2977
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:14,540
It's it's more intelligent philosophy
behind like you see all these hunting

2978
02:55:14,541 --> 02:55:18,680
shows like Well I'll tell you what is a
big book came out it will tell you what

2979
02:55:18,681 --> 02:55:22,850
we shot and with that gun I tell you what
you don't have any of that stupid shit

2980
02:55:22,851 --> 02:55:23,684
in it.

2981
02:55:24,230 --> 02:55:26,340
It's interesting it's fascinating.

2982
02:55:26,380 --> 02:55:30,710
It's your you're a well read introspective
guy and I love the narration on it

2983
02:55:30,711 --> 02:55:32,360

It's a great fucking show.

2984
