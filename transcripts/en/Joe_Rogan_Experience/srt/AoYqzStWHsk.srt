00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,110
The joe rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the flashlight.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,630
Do you sense a no nasal sort of a tone

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,920
voice today?
I tried to give you allergy medicine.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,870
It's a little bit of a cold or allergies.
You think so?

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,260
Because you me and like everybody I
know exact same symptoms. Exactly.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,240
Are you coughing? I'm mostly
sneezing, runny noses, burning.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,310
I shit in my eyes and
I call once in a while.

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,210
No burning guys may just coughing
and limb running nose. Yeah,

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,400
but I don't feel bad. I feel physically
I feel fine. Maybe a little tired.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,950
I think you're going to be okay.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,870
We also podcast or rammed
all over your face today.

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,060
This week we've been
podcasting like crazy.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,230
I don't know if that's
wears you out though. It,

14
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:43,460
it makes me run out of things
to talk about. Definitely. Yeah.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,700
Like yesterday I had to try hard.
We did once after mine too.

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,160
We didn't doing, yeah, I've done
the naughty show and whatever. Yeah.

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,750
At least is a lot of people on those
shows that they can kind of keep the ball

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,380
rolling. Yeah, but you, yeah. Yeah.
You feel like you stuck? It's still,

19
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,300
it's still not laying on the couch crying.

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,990
I'm not used to doing that. Some people
out there working in coal mines, Brian,

21
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,700
I know there's real workout.
There's was real jobs.

22
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,390
Anyway, what I was about to say is
we're brought to you by a rubber vagina.

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,750
It's not rubber. It's like
a mineral. What does it,

24
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,480
he explained it yesterday.
I don't know, but he's,

25
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,300
he kind of hinted that I could maybe
put it in my mouth a little. Yeah,

26
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:24,140
he's think you wouldn't recommend it,
but I bet you could eat it and live

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,601
in his prime.

28
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:29,960
Steve in his prime would have eaten a
fleshlight or if you're a Tom and Jerry

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,640
deep, remember eating the shoes. I think
we talked about this a long ass time ago.

30
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,670
Remember? It was like big and
cartoons to always eat your shoes.

31
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:41,000
Like you cook it up and then you cut
it off like a steak. You know why?

32
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,170
I think we talked about it really.

33
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:45,770
Poor people used to actually eat
fucking shoes. Man. That's amazing.

34
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,801
Well,
you know,

35
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:51,630
I don't think we realize how bad it was
in like the Great Depression during the

36
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,080
Great Depression. When my grandma,
she's doing, my grandfather grew up,

37
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,250
he had this, this is my grandfather
always has had this serious,

38
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:03,540
serious air about him because he had
seen people that like almost starved to

39
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,460
death. You know what I mean? Like he had,

40
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:09,120
he had lived in an era where
that was a real possibility.

41
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,050
Like in America, you might
starve to death. It's not,
not going to be everybody,

42
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,390
but it's possible things.

43
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,550
Things were really fucking bad
and if you can live through that,

44
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,090
what does this have to do with plastic?

45
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,180
John is crime? Nothing. Nothing.
Goddamn and hand them back then.

46
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:25,080
Thank God we have them now.

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,260
Yes, first of all would certainly
keep the population down. Definitely.

48
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,130
This is an excellent tool for
population control. The flashlight.

53
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,060
We are also sponsored by
onnit.com makers of Alpha brain,

54
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,570
the cognitive enhancing supplement
that I take, I take every day. Um,

55
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,410
there's a lot of information available
about it on [inaudible] Dot Com o. N n. I.

56
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:58,540
T if you fascinating to any of this stuff,

57
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,920
I you to please Google nootropics and Oh,

58
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,220
tropics and nootropics are essentially
nutrients that have been shown to have a

59
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:11,110
positive effect on the way your brain
works and Google it and read the pros and

60
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:14,620
cons and do your research
and experiment with stuff.

61
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,330
You don't have to go out
and just take Alpha brain.

62
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,660
If you have some experience in
nitro because you already know you,

63
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:21,530
you enjoy their effects, then go
ahead and try it. But you know,

64
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,610
if you don't try out some other
stuff first, try out some.

65
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:29,260
There's a bunch of different kinds of
nootropics that are available and it's all

66
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:32,230
available online through the wonders
of this thing called the Internet.

67
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,700
And it's not a check that,
and it's the Gabba is,

68
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:38,460
I'm completely different from a big top
puppet and I see it. Yeah, it's not yoga,

69
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:42,820
but Gabba Gabba just correct the
controversy. It's stews. Um, so anyway,

70
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:46,720
we have a bunch of different supplements,
a fitness supplements for a,

71
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:50,080
for exercise. There's shroom tech sport.
It's an amazing endurance supplement.

72
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:53,230
I use that when I do Jujitsu or kettle
bells or anything really difficult.

73
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,850
There's shroom tech immune, which is a,
a great immunity boosting supplement.

74
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,690
As I talked to you with a runny nose.
What we also have a new mood,

75
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:06,130
which is a, uh, um, a mood boosting
serotonin enhancing supplement.

76
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:08,700
It's called a,
it's a five HTP and l tryptofan.

77
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,170
And when you mix those two together,

78
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,770
both of them are responsible
for producing serotonin.

79
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,640
So it sort of a is like gives you the
building blocks for Serotonin and it makes

80
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:21,680
your brain produce it. It's nice,
it gives you a little, a little,

81
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:25,270
a little happy feeling. So it's
all natural stuff. Check it out.

82
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,680
The first 30 pills that you order,
it's, there's a 100 set, excuse me,

83
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:34,060
a 100% money back guarantee. You don't
have to return anything. You just say,

84
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:36,460
I don't like the stuff you
get all your money back. Okay.

85
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,570
We can't make it any easier.

86
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,540
We're trying to be as as fair
and as nice as possible. And our,

87
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,730
our goal always is number one is no one,

88
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,150
I don't ever want to do anything
where anybody feels ripped off.

89
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,540
So that's why we have this
money back guarantee in place.

90
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,320
I'm much more concerned with not having
people feel ripped off than I am with

91
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:57,130
making money. Okay, so there it is. Go
to [inaudible] dot com check it bitches.

92
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,020

95
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,950
I can't remember. He gets, you have to

96
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,880
Dammit. And he's in a plane right now
too. I can't even text him. All right.

97
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,320
Whatever.
Yeah,

98
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,560
you'll have to download yesterday's

later. Sorry. Make him work for it, man.

100
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,410
It's me, man. I fucked up. I should,
I should've had that shit right.

101
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,720
It was something weird like
Tsk or something. Was it? Yeah.

102
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,600
And I ain't just making shit
up and confusing people.
Somebody probably had it.

103
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:39,960
It was on the tip of their tongue and
then you just said that and you just fuck

104
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:44,650
them sideways. Boom into the
woods. Speaking of fuck sideways.

105
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:48,540
We're talking to Matt Paxton from
fucking hoarders. Ladies and gentlemen.

106
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,750
Cue The music.
Let's start this officially

107
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,490
try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

108
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,753
Yes,

109
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,753
no,

110
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,640
we are talking today to Matt Paxton from
hoarders and you want to talk about a

111
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:10,670
dude who has seen some unusual shit.
I've see it.

112
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,600
Everything must have a completely
different perspective on human beings than

113
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,940
your average person. Yeah.
Oh, I mean I'm, it's,

114
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,580
it's to a point now
where I have a hard time.

115
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:23,290
Like I mean I live in the suburbs now.
I have a wife and kids and I fight.

116
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,450
I'm bored to death like hanging out
with the guys in the neighborhood.

117
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:30,640
Cause I'm Amy during the day,
I'm, you know, shovel and
200 dead cats and you know,

118
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,330
45,000 pounds of Shit.

119
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,450
And then I got to go talk to some guy
about that email that he got in his cube,

120
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,690
you know, and I can't get, I mean
I, it's actually affecting, I'm,

121
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,800
I need the crazy shit down.
It's,

122
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,010
I'm really having a hard
time living a regular life.

123
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,390
So you will become addicted to all this.
Essentially. I'm, I'm a recovering addict.

124
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,750
My issue was gambling.
I had a serious gambling problem,

125
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,990
lost everything when I was 25
I mean literally rock bottom,

126
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,050
sitting in a ditch in Lake Tahoe,
Nevada.

127
00:06:56,051 --> 00:07:01,051
I got my ass kicked by a bookie and like
had to start over like I literally five

128
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:05,300
bucks in my pocket and I went and gambled
it trying to make it 10 I hit rock

129
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,670
bottom and over the last,
what,

130
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,390
10 years slowly but surely got back out.
And I've seen it all.

131
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:13,820
And so it works for me with the hoarders
because like I'm not going to judge

132
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:14,750
them.
I've been in a much,

133
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,960
I mean I thought about sucking Dick
for money one night. I didn't do it,

134
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,010
but I put it on the table. Wow. Because
I was in a lot of trouble and I was like,

135
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:24,710
you know, it can't taste that bad.
It's not that horrible. You know?

136
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,270
Like I started justifying it in my head
and I put a lot of things on the table

137
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,840
that night. Wow. Sicker. And I talked
about it when we were like, you know,

138
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:33,231
I was like,

139
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:37,670
I'm going to run drugs from New York to
Miami just once and get out of trouble.

140
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,180
Not like I knew how to set that up or
anything, but in my mind I was like,

141
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:43,390
I'm going to do it. And so
like, I mean there was a lot of,

142
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,290
I was in so much trouble,
put a lot of things on the table.

143
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,430
So when I see a lady that's shit in
her oven, like I'm like, Eh, you know,

144
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,500
it's not that bad. Really. Oven. And I've
had one lady did. Yeah. She actually shit,

145
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,040
she shit in a bag and then put the bag
in the oven. Oh my God, to keep it fresh.

146
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:02,840
Right. What was this? Do you want to keep
it safe? Her Shit, she's saving her shit.

147
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,860
I get that. It was a special,
something that was a,

148
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,470
I think there was a birthday
cake and involved. Hey,

149
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,180
so we can't shit from a particular meal
that there might've, yeah, their moves.

150
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:18,830
Something important too. I know in, and
you know what? I'll get right at it.

151
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,440
These people are not crazy. I hate
that word. Crazy. They sure sound it,

152
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,020
but something really intense has happened
to them at some point in their life

153
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,900
that made him,
that got it.

154
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,570
Jump started it and got him and then
about 10 years of bad decisions got them

155
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:34,280
there after that.
But something horrible,

156
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,380
tragic happened to them that initiated it.

157
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,830
So there's this horrible tragic
thing that happened to them.

158
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:42,740
Does it just fuck with the
way they see reality? Totally.

159
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:44,850
I mean they're off sections of reality.

160
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,810
That's why I'm so excited to be on this
because you're willing to like go into

161
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:49,640
different realities and
understand that there are,

162
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,360
you could have a whole separate world
that exists in your mind even though

163
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:56,760
you're living in a different one. And what
happens is a lot of functional, crazy.

164
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:58,290
Yes, absolutely. Oh yeah.

165
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,020
We've had judges and lawyers and
doctors mean we had one lawyer.

166
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:03,990
That word when judge that we literally
had to clean his house from midnight to

167
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:07,050
6:00 AM because he didn't have
anybody to know what was going on.

168
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,680
But yet here I am. Hello
the guy on hoarders that 3
million people in the night,

169
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:15,210
see if I'm going into your house every
other hour is pretty obvious. You know,

170
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,820
we're cleaning up your house. What did
you have to do to the judge's house?

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,640
We'd clean it. I mean it was full. It
was coming. He but his was nice stuff.

172
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,920
It was like art and you know,
fancy things,

173
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,400
antiques and just things he had
bought who's just over Bali. He,

174
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,940
his was an issue with his wife,
believed stuff made you who you were.

175
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,380
And so he wasn't really, he
wasn't comfortable with, you know,

176
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,790
what you do as a person is who you are.
He was whatever you buy is who you are.

177
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,150
And so there they were searching for
more self worth and they just kept buying

178
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:45,390
things. Oh I see. And I mean we
get, it does, it's all mental.

179
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:48,720
It's never about the physical stuff,
which is hard to believe. I mean,

180
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:53,721
we could get deep into these hoarders
get into big deep worlds where they think

181
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,580
things matter. And I always
say it's called a, there's
an old Avett brothers song.

182
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:03,090
If you've heard David brothers.
Interesting band, really cool band.

183
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,740
How do you spell it? Even a v. E t. T
David brothers. They're, they're amazing.

184
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,260
They drive a lot of my theories
on life. Really? Yeah. Oh yeah.

185
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:13,620
I mean they changed the way I work. Like
first time I heard him I was like, wow,

186
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:16,440
this must have been what it must've been
like to hear the Beatles for the first

187
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:19,260
time. And I know that's a
road you don't throw out.

188
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:24,090
I know that this up from North Carolina,
they,

189
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,620
they've got, it's their bluegrass but they
think they're led Zepplin. Really? Yeah.

190
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,780
So they play really fucking hard core.
Some of that shit on. They, they just got,

191
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,200
they just got picked up by
Rick Ruben. Their last album
was Rick Rubin proof. Wow.

192
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,720
Does Rick Ruben some of that crazy beard?
I don't know.

193
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,400
I only know him from
like that Nyu picture.

194
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,820
I only know him from like Beastie boys.
Yes.

195
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,600
You think that was her freshman year of
college? Him and uh, who was that guy?

196
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,420
The black guy. Um, Russell Simmons and
him will roommates freshman year at Nyu.

197
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,800
Yeah. It's pretty crazy. It's crazy to
me. They both seem to be like really,

198
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,600
even though they're like super successful,

199
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,560
the both of you would be like really
nice guys. I met Russell Simmons, like,

200
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:07,360
you've his Twitter now about love.

201
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:11,550
It's all love and sexual yoga
and drink water. And it's like,

202
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,170
yeah, he's a big guy. I met him in
an elevator at a shoe convention.

203
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,790
Winning if there was a, there's a, what
is the name of the song? Brian? Uh,

204
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,950
10,000 words. Acoustic and it's probably
not something you went here. It'd be,

205
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,910
maybe it is to distraction. It is
there. That's in the back of there

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,510
trucks.

207
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,510
[inaudible]

208
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,660
hit that one line. Distraction four. Is
that a song that'll see you'll see them.

209
00:11:55,661 --> 00:12:00,661
How they live is a really amazing one of
those dudes had his pants rolled up and

210
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:04,150
he was barefoot.
I fair country find that offensive.

211
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,000
They're definitely playing the
part in there. I mean they are.

212
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,890
I find that slightly offensive.

213
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,190
You knew they were filming that audio
dude decided to roll your pants up and

214
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:16,090
take your shoes off. There's still out
of your butt. No Man, I'm so comfortable.

215
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,013
They're still,

216
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,560
yes.
Yeah.

217
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,840
I was in love with the guy plays a banjo.

218
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,180
I wish that it wasn't enough to

219
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,790
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

220
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,970
it's a whole different world.
This is very original though.

221
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,930
It doesn't say,
I can't even think of things that,

222
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,990
it sounds like it's a six albums
in three years. Really? Yeah.

223
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,900
They just throw up music.
I'll have to check out.

224
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,190
But the whole point of that
was they have a line that says,

225
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:46,140
I'll never know silence without
mental violence. Whoa. And I get it.

226
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:49,530
I get really deep into the word and
then like I just love their music and he

227
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:50,191
said,
I never know.

228
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:53,550
Silence without mental violence and that
mental violence is the key word for me

229
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,740
for a hoarder there 24 seven they're
mind is never asleep like you and I,

230
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,240
you're a PR. I think your brain probably
goes over time a lot as I mean I listen,

231
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,970
I'm a huge fan of the podcast and it
is pretty up geeking out to be here but

232
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:09,210
like to to know out to have
you to thank you for sure.

233
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,540
So don't mean to like youth.

234
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,250
You're will you allow your brain to go
deeper than a lot of people that are

235
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:16,350
willing to,
I don't even know what that means.

236
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,310
All I do is if something is curious to me,
I follow up on my curiosity,

237
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,450
but you don't have the time to do it.
I think that's the difference. I'm not,

238
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:26,770
I don't work a regular day job where,
you know,

239
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,130
between nine to five I have to have the,
you don't allow rules to,

240
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,880
to limit your brain. Well I don't
have to, you know, it's really,

241
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,290
a lot of it is though I've,

242
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,340
I've been very lucky in and
how have sort of a managed to,

243
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,960
to manage my life and it's
just, yeah, I don't, I,

244
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,030
I can think about things. I don't
have to think about a company all day,

245
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,990
but someone does. Someone decide, oh
well you had a think of those things.

246
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,100
Your brain just goes, what while I'm
allowed to, I mean, I think that's

247
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,310
what's really hard for people's jobs.
It's really hard for people is, you know,

248
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,340
when you fucking work 40 hours a
week plus traveling, commuting,

249
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,870
that's a lot of time. That's not
yours. More than 50% your life,

250
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:07,130
not yours and your firm. For most of
us, W you know, not me, but you know,

251
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:10,700
I have been in the past for sure. We, you
know, when you work in a job like that,

252
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,910
you're giving away a giant chunk of
your life. That's the majority of us.

253
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,930
That's why the systems work. People are
tired. People are tired all the time.

254
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:21,330
That's why ridiculous systems are hard
to get out of place because people were

255
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,310
just too tired to fix them.

256
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,090
Yeah. I mean I'm lucky. I
always say hitting rock bottom.

257
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:29,560
For me it was like the greatest thing
ever because you fuck up so many times.

258
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,490
By the time you get back at a rock bottom,
like you pick, you pick yourself up,

259
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,400
you've broken all those rules and you're
like, fuck, I'm not getting a real job.

260
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:39,580
So you feel like you're
probably the perfect person
for this show because you're

261
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:42,930
not even judging these people cause hell
no. You've never, you've been done worse.

262
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,680
You've been down crazy street. Much
worse down. Yeah, absolutely. That's a,

263
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,720
that's beautiful man. Much worse.
And so I'm not going to judge this.

264
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,400
I'm totally not going to judge them.
No one is.

265
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,830
What a great message that is though.

266
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,750
If you're saying you've done much worse
and here you are with your shit together,

267
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,920
there's nothing. Yeah, but I sure didn't
for 15 years. That's so important.

268
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,540
I don't think I have my shit together now.

269
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,030
I'm just on TV and it looks
like I have my shit together.

270
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,140
I think right now you right now,
you do have your shit together.

271
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,720
If you're living in the moment right
now, we're seven yesterday. Yeah.

272
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,080
You're not mapped out, you know, shitting
your pants. You're not going crazy.

273
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,130
You know, you know he murdered a
hooker. No, but one of my guys,

274
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:21,290
one of my employees did murder other
guy have a lot. All my guys are ex con.

275
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,650
Oh yeah,
they're the best employees for this work.

276
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,520
One of your employees murdered again.
He did 20 years. He just hooker. No,

277
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:30,340
the other guy was a drug deal there. Any,
uh, I asked him, I was like, I was like,

278
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:33,760
what's a like you did 20 years? His
name's Ronnie, great guy. I was like,

279
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:37,540
what's the, I'm like, what happened? And
he goes, well, you know, it was me or him.

280
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,500
Like, okay, I get that concept. And
I go, so like tell me the story.

281
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,820
And I told him, I checked
with parole officer. It wasn't
a sec. I'm all my, I like,

282
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,050
I like my guys to be ex cons cause
they're not going to judge like,

283
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,910
oh cause they're gonna go back to jail
the next day. If they fuck up with us,

284
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,300
I'm their only chance. So with our
hoarders we're their only chance to clean.

285
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,590
So I prefer to have like part of what if
that one fuck up is like raping you or

286
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:02,920
hurting you? That would suck. I
mean, yeah. I mean I tend to, I,

287
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,270
it's never happened yet. I mean I, I
don't let them know my family if that,

288
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:10,000
if that's what you're leaning towards.
They don't know my family.

289
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,170
But you purposely hooked them
up with jobs. Absolutely.

290
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,950
I think they're the wounded. Absolutely.
And I know they're not, I mean a cow,

291
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,980
I'm a college kid drives me crazy cause
he wants to tech check a cell phone all

292
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,260
day. He wants to try to get laid that
and I don't me wrong, I get that too.

293
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:30,580
But I mean he, he's focused on everything
other than my client, my hoarder.

294
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,270
He's just happy to be. I'm receiving,
my worker is from prison is just,

295
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:36,580
he just got out on Saturday.
He's just happy to be out.

296
00:17:36,581 --> 00:17:38,440
He's been in a 10 by 10 for 20 years.

297
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:40,990
How do you know whether or not you can
trust them and you pick I go through.

298
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:43,150
There's some, yeah, there's
some church groups that Rehab.

299
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:46,300
I'm in in prison and we know
they've been sober for two years.

300
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:49,350
These guys are like devoted to
a vegan diet. I mean they're,

301
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,470
they're already have committed
to lifestyles inside the
system to get clean. Wow.

302
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,170
So I mean try it.
I mean believe it or not,

303
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:57,180
staying sober in prison is
a really hard thing to do.

304
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,270
I sound you can get anything
you want, any water, anything.

305
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,580
These guys will tell you,
man, anything you want,

306
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,340
you can have it in a day if you're
willing to pay. Really? Yeah.

307
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,570
I mean these guards make 20 grand a year
and they can pick up an extra 60 or 70

308
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:11,760
running shit to the prisoners.
I don't really have a problem with them.

309
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,680
It's like I get it. It is what it is, man.
It is what it is. I get it. Know prison.

310
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:20,160
What's fucking, it sucks. It
sucks. I can't imagine it.

311
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,950
If you got to get high to get
through it, so be it. It's the worst.

312
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,520
It's the worst way to fix people. It's
the worst sort of friction. I mean,

313
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:31,500
it does for us, for some scares
them into a life of discipline.

314
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,750
Like Bernard Hopkins,
he's a perfect example.

315
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,790
You know Bernard Hopkins when he was
young. Yeah. Yeah. He, when he's like,

316
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,380
he's the current light heavyweight
champion and I think he's 47 he's insane.

317
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:47,500
Yeah, he's disciplined. It's
just ridiculous. And the
discipline is the key word.

318
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,760
I mean, these guys are so devoted,
they don't even try to eat it.

319
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,430
You think it's hard to eat a
healthy lifestyle outside of prison?

320
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,810
Try to eat a healthy lifestyle with
no, I mean they, they're just, I mean,

321
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:00,630
they'll leave like just water
and bread and that's it.

322
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,160
I mean like isn't unhealthy.
No. Well they'd, food is so bad.

323
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,100
Food is so bad and they'll
just so committed to a clean
lifestyle by the time we

324
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:10,920
get them. They're awesome.
It's so ridiculous to me.

325
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:12,780
The fact that we have private prisons,

326
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,840
that fact is so shocking to me that
there are actually businesses that profit

327
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,670
off substantially,
probably only profit,

328
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,650
a fair amount of people that get arrested.

329
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:27,150
And so they also lobby to keep certain
laws on the books to make sure there's

330
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:29,910
more things. So remember people for,
so there's more people in the prisons.

331
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:33,690
It's like this is the
matrix most that's insanity.

332
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:37,710
Most of my dudes are young black
men that never knew their dads.

333
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,980
They were just trying to get by.
They never had a fricken chance.

334
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,360
They knew they in their mind
selling a little weed on the corner.

335
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,430
That was right there.
Wasn't even wrong.

336
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:48,960
But I mean difference
between right and wrong.

337
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:53,830
It's totally subjective and a lot of
our guys, they don't, and their world,

338
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:56,040
they're just trying to alive.
Why is, why is that wrong?

339
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,940
But it's okay for the guy to
sell oxycodone because I'm white.

340
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,770
I didn't get caught or I had the,

341
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:06,330
I had the proceeds to not to get out
of trouble. Yeah, that's so silly.

342
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,060
So it's really predominantly,
so my guys, I like those guys.

343
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,800
They'll give me their heart
and they'll give my hoarder.

344
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,800
They'll give a hundred percent
effort well to my client.

345
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,160
And so that's the dude's I want. That's
really cool man. You know, look, I'm not,

346
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,230
I'm,
I'm certainly for prison.

347
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,680
I'm certainly for keep peak keeping
dangerous people. You raised a kid,

348
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:27,420
I hope you die in prison. I
agree. I agree. But you saw
we'd get out. Not just that,

349
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:29,700
there's a lot of other things that
happen that people get arrested for.

350
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:30,690
And I think,
you know,

351
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,750
I think we really could do with a better
way of rehabilitating people and a

352
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,880
better way of sort of managing
kids that are coming up.

353
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,220
We've got to recognize when there's big
populations of kids without fathers and,

354
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,340
and, and terrible neighborhoods where
everybody's stealing and it's just,

355
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:47,660
it's crime.
Everywhere we go.

356
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,830
There's gotta be a way that some asshole
can profit off helping these people.

357
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,140
But that's the only way I'm
pitching a deal right now.

358
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:57,710
Me and like I keep telling,
I'm trying to get, yeah,

359
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:02,480
cause to me it's workforce development
really. And if you do these kids, they,

360
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:05,260
none of them have dads.
Most of their dads are in prison or dead.

361
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,490
And I don't want to, I don't want to paint
a brush and say everyone is this way,

362
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,620
but a lot of these kids
don't stand a chance.

363
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,820
They just simply don't stand a chance.

364
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:16,210
So I'm saying they're going to be for
the next 20 years they're in prison.

365
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:18,100
So let's just go ahead and
get in there cause they don't,

366
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,040
I actually found out for something
like guys, you don't even qualify.

367
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,250
You think it's bad outside with no money
and no funding for social services.

368
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,430
You try to get funding inside a prison.
I mean they're at the bottom of the list.

369
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:28,990
There's no government money for prisoners.

370
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,040
So these dudes can't even check out a
book in the library until the last two

371
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,260
years of prison. Really. You own,

372
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,770
you're only available for educational
services your last two years.

373
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,340
So what if you're on, you're
on eight 20 years, 18 years.

374
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:45,820
You're sitting around Jurgen and
no books, nothing. Holy Shit, Ron,

375
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:49,660
he got worse from, he spent nine
years in solitary. Whoa. First,

376
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:53,080
first day went in, he had to beat
a guy up show that he was tough.

377
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,860
He got out and he was mad. He
said, I was angry for five years,

378
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,390
and think about that statement.

379
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,890
Angry for five years and you're in a 10
by 10 dark room and that's all that you

380
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:07,840
are, is angry. He had nothing else.
It's insane. So he, I mean nothing,

381
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:10,690
no break, nothing. Five years
he gets out, finds the same guy,

382
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:13,240
beats the shit out of God,
goes back in for,

383
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:16,510
for Jesus Christ because he was mad
at that guy for five years. Well,

384
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:20,290
he's fucking crazy at that point.
He was. Yeah. Wow. What is,

385
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:25,460
what is that experience like a locked
within origin contact for five years.

386
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,750
Nine he got out for 30 seconds
while we had a little contact.

387
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,100
If somebody came in for, I
dunno, 30 minutes. First of all,

388
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,100
have they ever let that guy out of jail,
Ronnie? He thinks served just time.

389
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,580
I mean, it's crazy. And that's another
part that's pretty crazy. You know,

390
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,440
he started his time,
you know,

391
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,200
one of a rehabilitation is that
there was no rehabilitation.

392
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:45,280
I'm doing it for your rotation.

393
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,260
I'm teaching them what
it's like to be a real man.

394
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,850
I'm teaching what it's like to to
talk and to listen and to communicate.

395
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,250
I mean we're doing the
rehab and that's what I'm,

396
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:55,870
I mean I really event my next
thing after the show's over,

397
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,320
I want to do a for profit program. When
we go into prisons in the last two years,

398
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,260
we give these kids an NBA cause
most of them are drug dealers.

399
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,300
They get cost of good sold. They get
business. I mean they were selling drugs.

400
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,090
They understand what things cost,
they understand margins,

401
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,580
they get it and they already
understood the principle of business.

402
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,730
They got two years to sit around
and do nothing. I want them to,

403
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,650
I want to teach them
good business principles,

404
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,040
let them let it be a contest and
whoever comes with a good idea,

405
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,320
we're going to fund them.
So when they get out,

406
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,250
we were going to have a for profit halfway
house that when they get out they now

407
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:29,920
get entrepreneurial training
for the next two years.

408
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:33,220
So they get out and they're in there with
us for two years and we train them and

409
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:35,740
then we teach them the business and get
their business started. That's awesome.

410
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,680
I think it'd be, I think there's a way,
but there's a way to make money on it too.

411
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:40,570
I'm not doing it for free.
I'm not trying to be,

412
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:42,100
and I'm not looking for government grants.

413
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,500
I'm going to take a piece of their
business and give him a chance.

414
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,100
And as long as there's a good business,

415
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,270
they're gonna make money.
Right.

416
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,020
You mentioned them two years to sit in
a room and think and get and be able to

417
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:53,210
put a business. I mean, think of all
the businesses you're putting together.

418
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,550
If you had no other
distractions for two years,

419
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:57,290
how awesome would that big and
that same prisons, awesome.

420
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,960
But to be able to be devoted to
something would be really cool.

421
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:04,130
Super motivating is what it is. He
can be. Yeah, it can be. Or it can be,

422
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,860
you know,
mortally depressing.

423
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,010
I mean we've got to figure
out a better way to fucking,

424
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,120
we got to get Halliburton involved
and rehabilitating cities.

425
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,520
Huge company have Halliburton
could get like a grant.

426
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,180
I mean they can to make
Detroit prior to rebuild Iraq.

427
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,690
Why can't we hire them to like,
you know, rebuild Compton,

428
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,490
why can't we hire them to like,
you know,

429
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:30,491
set up some salts and more community
centers where kids without fathers can be

430
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:32,480
mentored, you know, on a, on a,

431
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:36,620
on a daily basis so that someone can be
disciplined to put their life in a year.

432
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,620
I've learned with doing hoarders,
man, like I'm, I'm learning.

433
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:43,310
It's cool to make a difference. I didn't
know that. It feels good, doesn't it?

434
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:45,800
It's amazing. It's the new admits,
my new drug. I mean, it's the best.

435
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,260
I don't need to gamble more because I'm
helping people every day and it sounds

436
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:51,440
silly. It's like totally addictive to me.
I love and I'm needy. Don't get me wrong.

437
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:53,360
I need,
that's part of who I am.

438
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:56,060
I need that fixed every day of
someone saying you helped me.

439
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,480
But if it does for
greater good, fine. Yeah.

440
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:01,130
I mean what you're
getting your little rush,

441
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:03,530
but you're getting super positive people.

442
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,760
It's like you've changed something that's
just chaotic and crazy like gambling

443
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,440
into something where you're,

444
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:13,160
you're getting this rush off of only
positive things and things that benefit

445
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:16,790
other people. Yeah. That's
beautiful. That's like the
best still getting my rush.

446
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,130
I'm still getting my fix and
[inaudible] session three channels.

447
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,240
You figured out how to do it all and be,
everything's positive though.

448
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,660
If some child molester that
he has to have that rush to,

449
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,540
to do whatever you got to do,
what if you could channel that into,

450
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,630
he's got to have that rush and
he'll do anything to get that rush,

451
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,640
but that rush is now helping
people who they'll look.

452
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:38,030
That would be beautiful if I believe
that was true. That's a bad example.

453
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,580
I don't think that, I don't think
they, I think there's a, yeah,

454
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:43,700
there's such a high recidivism rate
or something wrong with their brains.

455
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,470
I won't even, I won't,
I mean I'll help anyone.

456
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,680
I mean looney Ronnie killed a dude
and I'm fine with Ronnie in my home,

457
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,820
but I'm not going to help a child
molester. I can't do it. Yeah, I agree.

458
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,780
I've met a few guys over the course of
my life who had killed people and you

459
00:25:56,781 --> 00:26:00,830
know, some of them in war and some
of them, and that's all I knew.

460
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:04,340
Guys would kill people accidentally
and fights. I knew a guy I was,

461
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,830
that's actually, oh, he had a
weird look on his face, man.

462
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,920
I knew what God killed a guy, a buddy
of his and a drunk driving accident.

463
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,890
He always had a weird thing about him. You
know, while I was listening to your, um,

464
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,440
that podcast a couple weeks ago
when you were talking about you,

465
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,710
like you guys were talking about Rhode
Island and like all these dudes you were

466
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:21,800
talking about had gone to prison
or killed him on or, I mean,

467
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:24,020
they'd all guys had a couple of guys,

468
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,480
had this one guy be the
guy to death with a stick.

469
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,580
It was a comic more than a decision. I
mean, that's a commitment to, uh, to,

470
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,790
to an act. I mean, you don't, one
time you hit him and he dies, fine,

471
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:38,240
but you hit them a hundred times. You
know, there's, you made 99 more decisions,

472
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,500
crazy fuckers out there in this world.
It's amazing that you were like,

473
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,590
you're so

474
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,580
entrenched in them. Yeah. You seem like a
pretty, pretty together dude. I think so.

475
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:51,150
I mean, the kids changed me. I
mean, I got, I got two young,

476
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,340
I've got a two year old in a, in a five
month old and my wife changed me. I mean,

477
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:56,760
I never thought I'd get married. I mean,
I was living, when I got on hoarders,

478
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:59,940
I was living on a buddy's couch as
cleaning up shit for 12 bucks an hour.

479
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,910
Literally Shoveling Shit for 12 bucks
an hour and anybody who would hire me.

480
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,460
Okay. A dog, like people's
dogs, people's houses.

481
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:07,470
I'd go into a hoarder house
and clean up their shit.

482
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,750
[inaudible] an hour before the show even.
Yeah.

483
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:14,730
I was cleaning houses for four years.
I hit when I hit rock bottom. I mean,

484
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:15,900
I literally lost everything.

485
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:19,500
I was living on a buddy's couch for 200
bucks a month and I couldn't come up

486
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:23,070
with 200 bucks the third
month. He was like, dude, you
know, you're, we're 30 man.

487
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:26,640
Like you gotta you gotta do
something, man. I remember,
I'll never forget, I mean,

488
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:30,210
I've talked to some Alpine guys.
I, my 30th birthday I called,

489
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:33,330
I was engaged to another girl
and I realized I was like,

490
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:36,480
my life is a fucking joke. Like I
can't pull her into this. I'm not,

491
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:37,620
I got no business being married.

492
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:41,010
And so I called off the wedding like a
month before I was getting married and it

493
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:44,130
was, that was a hard decision. And I
was living on my buddy's couch and I,

494
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,160
it was my 30th birthday,
which is a milestone in your head.

495
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,290
And I said to my mom and my mom's like,
what do you want?

496
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,390
It's been a hell of a year.
And I was like,

497
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:54,060
I need a pair of running
shoes and I couldn't afford,

498
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:56,670
I was trying to run a marathon that year
and I couldn't affair for two pair of

499
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:57,870
shoes to run.
I didn't have no money.

500
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,530
I would like a hundred grand in credit
cards. And I mean, it was scary.

501
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,940
So I started cleaning up old ladies'
houses. Wow. And how'd you get that job?

502
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:08,400
Like how do I,
my dad died that the biggest thing,

503
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:12,450
important thing in my life for me with
my dad dying when I was 24 and that

504
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:15,420
changed my life and he, my
dad, I was a fucking asshole.

505
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,240
I was just a piece of shit.
All I cared about was drinking,

506
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,470
gambling and Nayland women. All three
great things. Don't get me wrong.

507
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:23,760
I mean my twenties were really fun.

508
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,660
It sounds like you had a good time and
and [inaudible] why'd you stop at a blast?

509
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:31,650
I really be talking to a guy who I spent
a good deal of my youth and pool halls.

510
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,990
Yeah. So you, I mean
hustle. I was a hustler man.

511
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:39,000
Attics on a regular basis if
you very, very common. Yeah.

512
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,320
I mean for me, I didn't, I hadn't
honed my hustle in the right place.

513
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,330
I'm still a hustler.
I'm just doing it on TV in a positive way.

514
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,460
I never changed my amp.
I'm just able,

515
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:53,190
I've learned I'm able to make more
money in a positive way than I am in a

516
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:55,260
negative way. How to put
on talk. Like I talk,

517
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,920
they don't say the things I say and
I've learned. Just being honest,

518
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,360
brutally honest is the
best hustle there is.

519
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,160
How did you get into this environment
where you're around like gamblers and how

520
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:07,530
did, how did all this
happen? Oh Man. I just,

521
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,320
I love at the first time I went to
casino I fell in love with it, man.

522
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:14,350
How old were you a college?
This Guy George. So that's
when you became a gamble.

523
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,400
Yanik towards Riyadh. This Guy
George Rome and he had Tourette's.

524
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:20,880
Really cool dude. He was a very
confident guy. He had Tourette's,

525
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:23,130
but he didn't give a shit. It's like your
problem that he had Tourette's. None is.

526
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:26,190
Wow. That's awesome. Very confident
guy. And so I was like very attracted.

527
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:29,520
I was like, man, this is a cool
fucking guy. Like he put it on you.

528
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,700
He did not care that he had Tourette's
and he would get the hottest chicks at

529
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:36,960
school. He's a really awesome, confident
guy. And I, my dad always told me,

530
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:38,400
he's like, you're never gonna
be the best looking guy.

531
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,380
You'll never be the hardest working guy.
You gotta be the most confident.

532
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,140
Cause it's like that's your only
in like you got no other value.

533
00:29:45,141 --> 00:29:46,360
That thing broke you off.

534
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,460
No, he just was honest. He's like,
you know, you're not going to be rich.

535
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,650
You're not going to be rich. You're
not going to be back. Here's a rule.

536
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,330
You ain't got a big dig. It is
what it is. And my dad got it mad,

537
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:02,160
mad women. I mean he got, and
he was so ugly, but he just
loved him. He knew how to,

538
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,120
he talked,
honest.

539
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,660
He talked on us and he treated them like
be treated with respect and as a women.

540
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,300
And so I learned a lot from him.
But when my dad died,

541
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,430
I went to this little place
called comfort zone camp.

542
00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:15,090
It's a camp for kids that have lost
their dads. And so I was in la,

543
00:30:15,091 --> 00:30:17,770
we helped to build the La
camp and my wife and I did my,

544
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,090
but I met her there and uh, but we help
build these camps for these kids at all.

545
00:30:21,091 --> 00:30:23,070
Their dads had Biden died and drive bys.

546
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,710
So you meet all these 12 year old
kids that are going in, you know,

547
00:30:25,711 --> 00:30:29,460
they're getting recruited by gangs already
cause their dads have already there,

548
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:34,160
there 23 year old dads, you know, had
been killed 25 but we did. So we learned,

549
00:30:34,161 --> 00:30:38,310
I mean I just, grief was a huge
part early on. And so for me,

550
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:41,880
like when I got out of my were like rock
bottom and I realize it's time to get

551
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,110
going where I've figured that out.
The,

552
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,560
the doing good versus doing
bad was at this camp. I would,

553
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,790
I got addicted to that camp.

554
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:51,180
I volunteered every single weekend and I
would just go away for three nights and

555
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:55,170
hang out these kids. And that's when
I got my new addiction was then wow.

556
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,870
It changed my life. That place
changed when I met my wife there.

557
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,660
I came up with new business, my business
clutter cleaner. I came up with it.

558
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:04,290
They're helping these kids. I met a lot
of great women and met my wife there,

559
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,370
so I mean I wouldn't have what I have.

560
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,090
How did you pull yourself
out of the gambling spiral?
You should. You found your,

561
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,020
I ran like a fucking chicken man.

562
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:15,050
I mean I got my ass kicked by a bookie
and I owed 40 grand the night before.

563
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,280
I had $10 left to my name. I knew I
owed this bookie when it was, I mean,

564
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,130
I think it was 40 grand and it was a lot.

565
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,240
I knew I only had $10 in my pocket
and my girlfriend was waiting for me.

566
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,620
I was in Lake Tahoe.

567
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,130
She was waiting for me at the top of the
hill up at heavenly and I was gambling

568
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:34,260
all night. I can't hide,
tend to what, $5? In my mind,

569
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:36,480
I thought I had $5 at the end
of the night and I was like,

570
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:38,280
I better put this down.
I got to get a cab ride home.

571
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:43,281
So I was giving up at $5 to my
name and I owed 42 the bookie foot.

572
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,660
Yeah. Which for a 24 year old kid and
make it not making that as a lot of money.

573
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:53,370
And so I put the chip down, lost,
came out, I had no, my last,

574
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:56,430
my last dollar came out and
had nothing and it was like,

575
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,230
I got a fucking problem and,

576
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,070
but I was looking at the cabby and he's
like the guy that drove me back every

577
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,340
night and he was like, he looked at
me and was like, I got no money man.

578
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:10,170
So I started walking up hill five miles
uphill to the ski resort. Tom's a very,

579
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,940
uh, awesome isolating place. So it
was a five mile. It's inclined roads.

580
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:17,910
We went up and I'm walking up this thing
and he came and picked me up and he's

581
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,890
like, dude, you gotta, you gotta
get your life together, man.

582
00:32:19,891 --> 00:32:21,510
You got to quit gambling and everyone is,

583
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:24,480
and at that point I was still judging
people and I was like looking at this,

584
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,110
I was like, this poor stupid cab driver
knew God knows what happened to him,

585
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:31,980
but I was totally judging
him yet he's saving me,

586
00:32:31,981 --> 00:32:35,550
he's picking me up and so I'm still
treating this guy like in my mind like a

587
00:32:35,551 --> 00:32:38,160
piece of shit. And he picks me
up, he drops me off and I'm like,

588
00:32:38,161 --> 00:32:41,300
can I give you anything I can, I eat.
He's like, dude, just stop gambling.

589
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,170
And he looked at me like, just fucking
stop. That's when they just stop. Well,

590
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,840
and I called my mom the next morning
and she was like, you're on your own.

591
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,310
So then I went, I called the bookie and
I was like, I don't know my dude, man,

592
00:32:50,311 --> 00:32:52,940
I don't have the money. And I mean,
this was like a movie. He was like,

593
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,380
no worries man. Everything's going
to be fine. We'll work it out.

594
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,550
What do you have? And I was like, I might
be able to scrounge up $1,000. He goes,

595
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,970
no worries. Come on down. I'll meet
you down this afternoon. So I was like,

596
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:07,370
this isn't like moves at all. This is
great. This we're going to work it out.

597
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,040
And I went down, he took the thousand
bucks and he'd beat the shit out of me,

598
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,880
broke my nose. I totally was
just clueless. And he, he just,

599
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:16,940
he broke my nose and beat the shit
out of me. That was my rock bottom.

600
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,440
And I was like, what the fuck am
I going to do? So I called around,

601
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,240
I called an old boss and I told him
what had, my mom had already said,

602
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:25,100
you're on your own.
Find a legal way out.

603
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:28,790
And that was the night where I put a
lot of dumb shit on the board and I was

604
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:31,320
like, alright, I'll just be a prostitute
or I'll do whatever. Like I was like, Oh,

605
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,160
you know, I was like, I can be
mentally strong. I can figure this out.

606
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,000
And I was lying to myself saying,
I can figure this out. Wow.

607
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,660
And so ended up an old boss got
me a job in Chicago when he goes,

608
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:44,240
when can you get, this was a
Tuesday night. And he goes,
when can you get there?

609
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,670
And I was like, Friday.
He goes, you start Friday,

610
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,200
they're going to pay off the bookie,

611
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:49,540
but you're going to have to
work for a year to pay it.

612
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:52,550
They're going to take it out, peace
out every night. And I was like, great,

613
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:56,060
thank you. And I literally, my buddy,
I didn't have money to get home.

614
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,390
So I had to play poker that night.

615
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,550
Borrowed 50 bucks from my buddy and play
one enough money playing poker to get

616
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:04,430
gas money. Oh my God. And that's why I
drove home and I never gambled again.

617
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,550
Really? You just quit? I quit.
I ran away and I still run away.

618
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,620
I still run away to death.
I just don't get,

619
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:14,060
I mean like this is the worst week for me.
The first, uh, the NCAA tournament. Oh,

620
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,960
killing me. Killing me, man. Oh my God. I
love it. Do you still watch it? Oh yeah.

621
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:22,280
Love it. Oh Wow. No, I just don't do
the sheets. I delete all the emails.

622
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:25,190
I just can't do the
sheets. Wow, that's crazy.

623
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:29,360
So you just love that kind of limited in
every day. I, you know, I don't sort of,

624
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,850
well you have a handle on it. Yeah.
I mean I think gambling eight years,

625
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,880
I don't really, yeah, I'm lucky.

626
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,140
I mean my kids are just wearing me out
and I don't really have the effort for

627
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:38,690
that kind of stuff anymore.
Does it still draw you though?

628
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,270
Every once in a while I get that itch.
Yeah. Every once in a while I'll get that.

629
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:41,931
Like I had it this year.

630
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:45,950
I had a really bad itch and I had a
flight to Vegas to do a hoarder's episode

631
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:48,980
and it wasn't even in Vegas. I just had
a three hour layover and I was like,

632
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:50,270
fuck yeah,
I'm going downtown.

633
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,380
And I got excited and I hadn't had that
itch in a long time. Like I can drink,

634
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:56,700
I can smoke, I can do whatever,
cause I can walk away.

635
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,030
I can't walk away from a table. That's my
weekend. I don't know how to walk away.

636
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:07,210
I have a dollar or 10 grand fucking
your special brain chemistry,

637
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:10,520
whatever it is in your mind.
Me, that's my gambling comes up.

638
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:15,260
You just being love is because that's
my ultimate way of shoving it to the man

639
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:18,300
and like, I'm better than you. I can
do this and I'm going know it's for me.

640
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,410
It's a self worth thing. I was
looking for self worth. So again,

641
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,260
but how do you get so forth that it
began for me? That's where it went, man.

642
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,780
I mean for you you might get,
I mean where do you get yourself worth?

643
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,850
I don't know. I get it too. I
want to think about it. Yeah,

644
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:31,760
my new thing now it's like I really know
that I'm making a difference on these

645
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:34,040
podcasts, so I dig that.
I'm starting to get it.

646
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:36,920
That's where I'm putting my rough go.
Five decisions away,

647
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,410
five decisions away and when it is
essentially what does it well it's about,

648
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:43,560
it just recounts all my mistakes.
Over the last 15 years,

649
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:47,370
I was doing a hoarder's where a in New
York City where this guy had a mass,

650
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:50,610
he had an acre in Brooklyn,
a massive property in Brooklyn.

651
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,290
This guy inherited it
from his dad and it was,

652
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,350
had about six feet of bicycles
all the way through the yard.

653
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,360
So an acre at six feet high.
Think of the metal,

654
00:35:57,361 --> 00:36:01,320
the value of that metal was probably a
hundred grand and metal and he had a bum

655
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,910
living in his yard.

656
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,230
So inside the hoard there was a bum living
there and that was one of the things

657
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,750
we had to clean up. We had to get
rid of the bum. So I was literally,

658
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,640
I mean this is two years ago,
I'm sitting here in uh,

659
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,390
in Brooklyn hanging out with this bum. His
name is Gregory. I'll never forget him.

660
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,520
And as a,
and this is the cool thing about hoarders,

661
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:20,040
I get to meet all dudes and I was
like, all right Greg, your head,

662
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:24,090
you end up here man. Cause he had, I
mean he had a bunch of like 40 ounces.

663
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,230
He had a bunch of a bunch of these magnum
condoms and so I was like, fuck yeah,

664
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:31,470
this guy's getting more acid than I am.
And he lives in, uh, in shack, you know,

665
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,750
speeding. And he was huffing.
I didn't realize it was hot.

666
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,080
He was just huffing gasoline huffing
gasoline. Yeah. Condoms. Yeah.

667
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:39,270
They would fill up the condoms
and then, uh, with the fumes.

668
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:41,970
And I thought he was getting asked. I
didn't really, I was just trying to get,

669
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,880
hi Joe. Hey. It is what it is, man.

670
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,730
Wasn't there a show on recently
where a woman had an addiction with,

671
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:52,080
with drinking gasoline? Yeah,
my strange addiction. Yeah.
What, what was that about?

672
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,200
You pretty much said it. She, she was
drinking. She really would just share.

673
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:56,880
They also asked for it.
She loved it.

674
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,510
There's people that do crazy things like
sleeping with hairdryers isn't really a

675
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:03,330
big, I've seen eating
glass. I read the other day,

676
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,810
my wife forwarded me this thing
apparently second to porn.

677
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:12,420
The most downloaded stuff is
I'm watching fat people on like,

678
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:16,530
people pay money to watch a fat
per stream, live a fat person.

679
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,040
Just living. Oh whoa. Second to porn. No,

680
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:23,770
I like the naked fast second
deport pay to watch face.

681
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,960
So there apparently is tons of website.
There was some girl on a, she was on TV,

682
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,780
my wife saw it.

683
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,920
There's like people out there that you
would pay like a monthly fee to just

684
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,730
stream live to watch this
fat person walk around. Wow.

685
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,130
And that doesn't do it for me,
but gambling did.

686
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,890
So to me I think it's all,

687
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:44,760
it's everything is related and the whole
reason I do well on hoarders is because

688
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,810
I've been lower or made worse
decisions they ever have.

689
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,760
And so they trust me and I am able to,

690
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,440
they know that and I screamed
that story to them. So before I,

691
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,160
by the time I get to meet with a hoarder,

692
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,520
I'm already part of their family because
they know I'm not about to judge them

693
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,590
period.
So you're just,

694
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,010
you're just helping them and
pulling all their junk out.

695
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,580
It's easy to throw shit stuff away now.
I also don't mind,

696
00:38:08,581 --> 00:38:11,820
like I get the bad stuff so
I get like 200 dead cats.

697
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,640
Is that cash shit drive you crazy or,
I mean,

698
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:18,390
the urine is what gets me and I can't do
the year end. The shit you don't smell.

699
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:23,310
The urine is much stronger seeing that
actual dead cats. I mean, I hate cats.

700
00:38:23,311 --> 00:38:25,100
I could get that.

701
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,660
I'm happy with the cats
and he's now dead dogs. I,

702
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,270
it's hard. I can't do that. The bumps you
out. Yeah, that has, I saw one with dog.

703
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:36,280
A blood lab was just laying in a cage,
dad. And that was really sad for me.

704
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:37,990
But like, I see a hundred
dead cats. I think it's funny.

705
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,660
Like that was really quite good. She
just watched it there. Yeah. Starvation.

706
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,360
It was really sad. Yeah. But it's weird.

707
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:46,120
Why is it any different for a dog
from a cat? It shouldn't, you know,

708
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:49,660
the diapers is my favorite now. I
laughed. I will fucking, I love, I mean,

709
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,740
I did one where this lady,
uh,

710
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,510
we had a really bad earthquake earlier
this year on the east coast and it's

711
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:55,880
right,

712
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,880
right near Washington DC and I was
literally filming a hoarder's episode.

713
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,030
I'm standing,
this lady's sitting on her toilet.

714
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,770
We're on the second floor of an old
brick townhouse outside of DC and a big

715
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:13,150
house and I'm standing on four feet of
her own diapers that she's been tossing

716
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,990
in a corner and her own diaper, own
diapers. So she take a shit in her diaper.

717
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,003
Oh my.

718
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,490
Or she'd have her period in her diaper
and it's just throw it in the corner and

719
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:25,190
the pile built up to be about four foot
high, about six foot across. Oh my God.

720
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,780
What are you dressed like? You and
the Hazmat suit? Yeah, that one.

721
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:30,580
I was in a hazmat suit
most of the times I tried,

722
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:33,910
I mean I just wear like boots and jeans
and a and how is she like existing in

723
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:37,090
that? They can live and they can live
anything. It's like an 80 year old smoker,

724
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:38,260
you know,
you see these guys and you're like,

725
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,720
you should be dead 20 years ago and he's
the toughest fucking guy you've ever

726
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:41,480
met.

727
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Her immune system must be going to be
an all hazmat and then they're just

728
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,560
sitting there hanging out.
Oh my God. I don't like to,

729
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:52,720
if I'm conversing one on one with them,

730
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,380
I don't want to have a mask on
because I think that's a wall and I,

731
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:56,890
and I don't want to lose
that trust with them,

732
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,710
but sometimes I'm not going to kill
myself from smelling your shit stupid.

733
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,420
I don't,
this shit doesn't bother me.

734
00:40:04,421 --> 00:40:09,421
It's the like when there's fleas that
have sat in your shit and then the fleet

735
00:40:10,231 --> 00:40:12,060
comes up and sits on me.
That's when I got into,

736
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:17,110
I don't want to be like sleeves on
my face full of shit, not just shit.

737
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:22,000
Your shit is a crime. It's more personal
and I know it's yours. So anyway,

738
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:25,800
this lady, this was the crazy part,
this lady, this is the greatest. Yeah,

739
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:27,400
I ain't got to the good part yet.
Wait for it.

740
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,970
So then I'm talking to her about like,
tell me the first, I was like, I don't,

741
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:33,880
I understand how you, after 10 years
you can throw your diapers. That's easy.

742
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:35,980
I said,
but the first time you made the decision,

743
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:39,820
I'm not going to shit in the toilet. I'm
going to just throw this in the corner.

744
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,560
I was like,
the first time is the hard decision.

745
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,990
So like that's what I was trying to get
to her. What did you, what did you think?

746
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:45,250
Why were you thinking this is okay?

747
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,760
Where did you justify in your head
that this is an acceptable behavior?

748
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,691
And so it's,

749
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:53,110
that first decision was so important to
me and as I'm asking these questions,

750
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,980
the house starts to shake
sideways and I'm like, hmm,

751
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,750
maybe we just got hit by a truck.

752
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,200
And then all of a sudden the
house starts to shake up and down.

753
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:05,530
And finally there's a 300 pound
camera guy right behind me as well.

754
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,230
And all of a sudden I was
like, holy fuck, this must be,

755
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:10,630
I've never had earthquake before. I
was like, this must be an earthquake.

756
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,080
And the house is just, it's
like, so I mean it's like Julio,

757
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,930
I mean it's just a circle and I'm
like, Eddie Max Freak out. I'm like,

758
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:19,180
get the fuck out. I'm screaming.
I'm like, get out, get out.

759
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,370
And I run down the steps and
I look at it and I'm like,

760
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,320
I don't want to die under your shit.

761
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,440
That's the worst place
to die under your shit.

762
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:31,590
And I realized I'm screaming this at this
lady in front of 30 people and it was

763
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,770
worse for her than the damn earthquake.

764
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,300
Me telling her I don't want to die and
under her shit and I felt so bad and I

765
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:41,470
was like, I just almost died in African
house and I'm worried about, you know,

766
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,500
upsetting this lady. Right.
But like that was you.

767
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,120
You never know what you're going to hit.
I mean,

768
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:48,950
that's what I love about my job
also. I mean, you, you know,

769
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:52,050
knowing that just feel like
you've just crossed a line. I did.

770
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,410
I cross the line with her, an iPod. I
still buy judged or every time I talk to,

771
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,440
and you knew she was crazy going in
there to like to say you're crazy.

772
00:41:57,441 --> 00:42:00,650
Once you're there, you don't say it. It's
not you. It's, it's obvious. It's like,

773
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,300
it's like telling a girl with
big tits that she has big tits.

774
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:03,170
Like you don't need to say it.

775
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,730
Everyone knows sometimes you
live in the real privately. Yeah.

776
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,600
So poker in the back and let her know
she's scared to let her know,

777
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:16,520
you know, don't try to keep
all your cards on the table.

778
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:17,490
Right.
Brian red band.

779
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,300
I often find that I think I'm a
hoarder and it's because it's uh,

780
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,530
I'm such a tech Dork that every one of
these things that you see here comes with

781
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:29,110
a cable and an instruction book and I
feel like I have to save that because I'm

782
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:31,960
going to need it later. That is
hoarding tendencies, believe it or not.

783
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,883
What's that?

784
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:36,460
Are we get guys that they want to
fix? I can fix this, I can fix this.

785
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,950
It's they hold on to things now
you actually know the limits.

786
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,380
Yeah,
I know the limits to a point,

787
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:44,010
but also that enclose or my
two horrible things. I just,

788
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,070
I hate fucking folding clothes are
hanging up clothes so I just kind of like

789
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,440
keep them in like, like piles
in my closet. Like it's pretty,

790
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:53,420
that's the two things.

791
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,710
I have a million Uber Douchey MMA tee
shirts that people have given me that I'll

792
00:42:57,711 --> 00:43:01,760
never wear. It's like a battle
ax and to a skull, you know,

793
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:03,200
like chop your head,

794
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:06,240
you must get so much stuff from people
because you're like kind of one of the,

795
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,100
one of the original dude. It's cool.
In some ways I get, uh, you know,

796
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,130
people send me like cool equipment,
so it's good in that way.

797
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,960
I get cleaning supplies. I mean, nonstop.

798
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:20,000
People send me equipment they want me to
use in a house, you know? Well, I mean,

799
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:21,820
it's good to get that shit
for free, isn't it? Yeah.

800
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,530
I just give it to the order I don't need,
I'm a minimalist. I don't want anything.

801
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:29,650
How many people that you go in and sort
of intervene and restructured their

802
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:33,070
life? How many of them, how many
of them does it stick with this?

803
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,470
This is the number one question.
Um,

804
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:38,810
if they invest in the therapy and I say
invest, I don't mean money. I mean time.

805
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:41,840
If you invest fully in
the therapy process,

806
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:46,110
it's about 60% with my guys. 60%. Yeah.

807
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,920
If you don't do the therapy guaranteed
hundred percent failure. Wow.

808
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,770
It'll be full within two
months and usually faster now.

809
00:43:51,771 --> 00:43:54,350
And I don't want to say
you said 60% success. Yeah,

810
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,440
but I don't want to say it's not always
traditional therapy. A lot of these,

811
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,260
when you see me on hoarders,
these are stage five hoarders,

812
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,450
which they're the worst. I mean,
they haven't, they've lived it,

813
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:05,430
been shitting in their living
room for 20 years. I mean,

814
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,460
I'm talking extreme extreme.

815
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,040
So traditional therapy is
not going to work with them.

816
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,860
So I don't want to act like if you
just talk therapy, he's not going to,

817
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:16,370
it's not for everybody. Right. And
so a lot of my stage five hoarders,

818
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,960
they've got to have,
there's a lot of new,

819
00:44:17,961 --> 00:44:20,570
there's a lot of western therapy that's,
that's actually amazing.

820
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,680
And there's a lot of, um, uh,
post traumatic stress disorder,

821
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:27,470
a light therapies that we're doing with
a lot of that the guys are doing with

822
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,060
all the guys coming back from Iraq now.

823
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:32,220
Those are some really fun like
guys that are, it's this light

824
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,120
therapy that they,

825
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,620
they hit him with all these
light treatments and it
actually helps them remember

826
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:40,200
whatever that tragic event was,
whatever the trigger was.

827
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,160
And it helps him go back to that because
most of these like a hoarder. Oh,

828
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:47,820
like it sounds crazy. I think it's fair.
I'm not a doctor. I mean I'm a trash guy,

829
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:51,540
but like the therapist that we work with,
they brought, we brought in some new,

830
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:52,590
like how many,
what was it?

831
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:55,410
Homeopathic doctors that have come in and
we found that traditional medicine may

832
00:44:55,411 --> 00:44:58,320
not always be right for hoarders.
And it's really interesting.

833
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,480
What does a homeopathic
doctor going to give?

834
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,340
Like is there something in there fucking
homeopathic book about hoarding? No,

835
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,560
I mean there's ginger root. Well Shit
like, I mean, like I acupuncture,

836
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:09,360
acupuncture does some crazy stuff,
man.

837
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:13,920
It doesn't at some bright
ideas fucking swears by,

838
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:18,120
it's all he talks about.
It's totally legit. Is it
legitimate? Is it one of those,

839
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:21,810
uh, power bracelet things where you,
well, if you believe in it, yeah, sure.

840
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:22,291
I know what you're saying.

841
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:26,100
I mean I had acupuncture done once
on an injury and a neck injury is,

842
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:30,330
I don't think it did shit well so for you
it's not legit, but I was open minded,

843
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,400
which just didn't work
for me at that moment.

844
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:34,560
Maybe it was something I needed
to do more than once or something.

845
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,310
And when Joe Diaz described that it seems
like he says Shit Weird Shit sometimes

846
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:41,550
like oh just brown shoes came out of my
foot. And I'm like, what's that mean?

847
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,620
She puts a foot and a bath and you see
the impurities come out of your body.

848
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,130
Like impurities are coming out of your
feet. Like what are you a fucking plan?

849
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,940
I've had brown shit. What'd he had
brown shit on my feet kind of out of it.

850
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:55,170
Makes Sense.

851
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:59,100
There's like a lot of like pseudo medicine
talk that these people throw around

852
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:00,210
and I always get confused.

853
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:03,390
I know I never know what's real
and what's just a crock of shit.

854
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,630
I'm old school man. If it works for
you and I believe it's with faith,

855
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:10,980
with Madison, whatever, if it
works, it works for you. Cool.

856
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:15,840
It may be totally fake in my world,
but in your world, if it works for you,

857
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,000
I'm fine with.
If you ever met one of those crazy dudes,

858
00:46:18,001 --> 00:46:23,001
it's like a healer and says you can line
up your meridians and touching places.

859
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,480
I've seen,

860
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,090
I seen guys that have smart guys
convinced that they can actually do that.

861
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:32,581
Oh yeah.

862
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,880
I mean I've seen that with real like
real successful people and they'll start

863
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,980
telling you how great this guy is.
I'm telling you,

864
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,020
it doesn't make sense at this guy.
He's like a,

865
00:46:40,021 --> 00:46:41,760
he's like some sort of a
[inaudible] or something.

866
00:46:41,761 --> 00:46:45,390
He knows how to line up your Meridians
and you meet the guy and you know,

867
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:50,110
if you are like me, you probably have
a very highly two seconds on a boat.

868
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:55,020
Yeah. You're like fuck out of my flat.
At least you're still talking to Andy.

869
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:59,810
Dick. Dick is not full of shit. I'll tell
you that. Don't say that about it. No,

870
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:04,010
just kidding. That is one thing.
And I hope so. I love Andy.

871
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,600
He's definitely not full of shit
though in these, he's crazy,

872
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:09,870
but he's not full of shit. But,
um, yeah, that, uh, that this,

873
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,590
this guy was like doing all this to these,
uh,

874
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,990
these dudes that I knew that were
like, you know, successful dudes and a,

875
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,290
I had to come along and, and you know,
and meet this fellow and you know,

876
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:21,480
started asking him about the
science behind what he does.

877
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:24,030
And it's just the more you get
deep into questions with it,

878
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:26,100
the more it starts crumbling.
Like, where'd you learn this?

879
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:30,310
What does it never stopped
with the question? Oh, it
was just, it was ridiculous.

880
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:33,580
It was preposterous. Involved
Turquoise. And they also did the thing,

881
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:36,310
he did something,
I don't like the Chrysalis.

882
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,940
It's something that I
really don't like. He, um,

883
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:44,010
he reached over and like pinched a hold
of my trap muscle while we're talking.

884
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,560
You ever have a conversation with
someone and they're like holding onto,

885
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:51,790
you know, not, not
hard, like not to, yeah,

886
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:55,270
but it wasn't even to the point where it
wasn't, I wasn't, I was not insulted him.

887
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:57,820
So he might say, look, well I was, I
was like, it's about to get physical.

888
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:00,880
It was not that he was being very
friendly and like a friendly gesture,

889
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:05,020
but he almost like hug. It was a weird,
like he had like a light pinch on me.

890
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,600
It was like a light pinch. It
wasn't, it was just a little,

891
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,750
just something that made me think like,
why is he doing this?

892
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:13,990
Like ever talks about dude, you ever
talked to dude in the hold your knee.

893
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,860
They were lean in and they hold
your knee and then they, they,

894
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:19,000
they want to tell you and I'll
tell you what right now Matt,

895
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,760
I didn't know what I was
going to do. They're like,
why the fuck are you holding?

896
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:26,080
Yeah, they were diverting you from
whatever it was really enhances the most.

897
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:27,910
So the guy did that when
he was talking to me,

898
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:31,080
which automatically makes me feel
like he's a charlatan pickpockets,

899
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,420
if I know that this guy is,
it's a hustle is a mental hustle.

900
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,680
This is what he's doing.
I mean,

901
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:38,580
obviously he's a tricking these people
in the fixing that he's healing and more

902
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,290
maybe as magic leave that on the table.

903
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,670
But when a guy does like a psychological
move like that where he just reached,

904
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:49,000
I mean that's like, that's really
like, it's like really base. It's not,

905
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,670
that's not like complicated at all.
It's like really obvious.

906
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,760
Like if somebody reaches in and
holds onto you, it's an odd move.

907
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:56,980
Like why are they hoarders
at one at a bad moment?

908
00:48:56,981 --> 00:49:00,720
I make sure I got a hand on her back
as a hug. Oh, you purpose, purpose.

909
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,860
But that strategy of good energy,

910
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:06,580
that's still the same thing for
negative energy. Well, it wasn't even,

911
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:08,620
this dude wasn't even being negative.
He was just,

912
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:11,590
he was going to make me uncomfortable and
I was just going to go along with what

913
00:49:11,591 --> 00:49:16,090
he was saying. You know, he didn't think
that that's, I think that's what they do.

914
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:19,780
Then you'll like really good conmen
will make you uncomfortable and all of a

915
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:21,250
sudden you're going along
with what they're saying.

916
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:24,220
Then you start justifying your
actions and then you're a part of it.

917
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:27,700
And you start telling everybody, I'll
tell me, and he's great at what he does.

918
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:32,500
Yeah, well this guy wasn't
bad at it. Yeah, he just
wasn't standup comedian ready.

919
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,480
You know, stand up. I'm going to,

920
00:49:34,481 --> 00:49:36,250
I'm going to stand up comedian
for training for three years.

921
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:39,400
If you're full of Shit, I'm going to
look at you immediately and go, oh,

922
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:44,050
look at this guy. It's very rare.
Unless someone's like a real sociopath.

923
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:46,540
It's very rare that I don't think
something's wrong. I immediately,

924
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:49,240
socially and even the sociopath,
they can't.

925
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:53,890
There's a natural way of interacting
with people that some people just don't

926
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:56,840
possess. They don't possess that
because they're fucking crazy.

927
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,200
And you can tell pretty quickly when
you're talking to someone and whether or

928
00:49:59,201 --> 00:50:00,190
not they'd have her hat,

929
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:05,350
but how disturbing is it when you have
friends that don't see that and then what

930
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:08,590
your friendships,
but it's not even that they're bad people.

931
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:10,990
Just that like you knucklehead,
you're in a cult.

932
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:13,900
Do you understand you were in a car
and get that with the dam? Amway man,

933
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,660
I get so upset when I find out a
true friend is like selling Amway.

934
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:21,250
All of a sudden I don't,
I don't even know pyramid scheme.

935
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,350
Is it like you're a good friend?
Like I trust you,

936
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:25,470
you're a good friend and here you
are trying to sell me on site.

937
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,100
Like and I realized it's not that they,

938
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,460
they were sold. I mean they're totally
blind to this right now and I'm like,

939
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,920
oh my God, like you fell for this.
Like I feel really bad and then it,

940
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,200
but it does make me reevaluate
my friendship with this person.

941
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:38,510
I've had to talk John half run
on a four or five different

942
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,420
pyramid schemes.
John Heifer,

943
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,860
I will call you every other
month with some new new thing.

944
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:46,370
Well all I have to do is invest 20,000
and this is what other guys have gotten

945
00:50:46,371 --> 00:50:48,200
out of this.
It's yellow Windex.

946
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,940
He always has some new
things I was going to train.

947
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,660
I'm going to train the businesses how
to write jokes and they're going to make

948
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:55,850
their own advertisement and I'm
going to do it all in house.

949
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,090
He's always got these wacky
ideas he's doing. You know,

950
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,350
he's doing a lot of these shows where he
does conference calls. Well he doesn't,

951
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,100
we haven't done a podcast
and I don't know, months. And
then I asked him recently,

952
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:11,390
he's like, yeah, I'm on the
road for 17 weeks. And I'm like,

953
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:15,110
are you fuck he's on the
road 17 weeks in a row?

954
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:20,810
I probably a day maybe if at all.
Wow. Have runs in their animal.

955
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,890
Who's a road animal?
Have you had an episode that,

956
00:51:23,891 --> 00:51:27,440
that you couldn't show for whatever
reason? Like was there an evidence scene,

957
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:28,310
a body or,

958
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,220
yeah, we get a lot of crime scenes
situations like you will, I mean,

959
00:51:32,221 --> 00:51:36,440
I personally have not on the show. I
mean, privately we found a lot, right? Um,

960
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,680
one of the other guys on there,

961
00:51:37,681 --> 00:51:40,180
he had one the other day
that this guy Cory traumas,

962
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,460
who's also on hoarders and he went into,

963
00:51:42,461 --> 00:51:47,461
her job was cleaning the house and they
found the lady's husband wrapped up in

964
00:51:47,611 --> 00:51:49,910
a, he'd been dead for like
five years. And you, oh my,

965
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,050
she just didn't get around
to calling the cops.

966
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:57,590
But in her mind then for an a
hoarder's mind, that makes total sense.

967
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,300
Tomorrow I'm going to call tomorrow,
I'm going to do this. Yeah.

968
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,320
And I talked about that mental violence
earlier. It's that mental violence,

969
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:09,150
there's so much going on in their head
that they can't, you know, I had a lady,

970
00:52:09,151 --> 00:52:11,990
she, she told me, he was like,
her mind is a massive spreadsheet,

971
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:16,110
excel spreadsheet and issues.
It's as many as many columns,

972
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:20,250
as many roses it can go. And she goes,
it's not that I can't let go of something.

973
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:22,950
She would have to check it off.
And she starts back up at one.

974
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,230
So the problem is she might get through
a thousand things in one day and only

975
00:52:28,231 --> 00:52:30,480
600 of them got checked off.
And this is all in her mind.

976
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,610
But when she wakes up the next morning,

977
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,780
she's got to start back at number one
and she's added another 5,000 things on

978
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:40,020
the bottom, especially on her mind, is
working that hard. So for this lady,

979
00:52:40,021 --> 00:52:42,090
that fan, you know her, her husband died,

980
00:52:42,091 --> 00:52:45,210
she wrapped him in a damn shower curtain
and she's like, okay, I'll do it.

981
00:52:45,211 --> 00:52:48,540
I better call Jesus Christ. I'm
going to call it. And I'm not,

982
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,670
this is not bullshit.
Like this is real life guys.

983
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:52,380
Like this is what happens
in a hoarder's mind.

984
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:55,290
And you don't see it in a half hour
show. Like, Oh this is why I'm so,

985
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,340
I think it's fascinating
for flame.

986
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:03,870
Fucking crazy probably is the town
that most people are fucking crazy.

987
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,370
They're not crying. I
hate that word. Crazy.

988
00:53:05,371 --> 00:53:07,970
They're not crazy quick mental
discipline to set me up.

989
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,850
Yeah, they're fucking
crazy. You just said it.

990
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:13,390
Don't say that there's anything wrong
with being crazy. Cause I'm crazy Brian.

991
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,490
Fuck,
we're all fuck a little crazy.

992
00:53:15,491 --> 00:53:18,190
And that's one of the parents I
found one that I like is crazy.

993
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:22,850
Every single person that I like is crazy.
They're crazy.

994
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:24,050
And if you're not look

995
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:28,620
crazy, you haven't anything,
you're boring. And I have
no value. This isn't crazy.

996
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,240
Tried to tell me Dunkin isn't crazy.

997
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,650
Tried to tell me you're not crazy
bitch because you guys know you're

998
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,910
37 years old.
You've got a clock that makes cat noises.

999
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,700
I did see it. Yeah. He's got a gun.

1000
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:48,870
There's 50 cats in front of the
front of the logo. Is a cat here.

1001
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:51,690
One of the old,
the old hoarders joke is,

1002
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:56,540
I hate cats so much I won't eat pussy
anymore. Oh, you just get so sick of it.

1003
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,110
You just haven't had a good cat full.
Why do you a hit cancel much?

1004
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:03,690
What does this now man,
the smell just, well,

1005
00:54:03,691 --> 00:54:08,520
you're seeing the worst case scenarios.
You know what I mean? Cat In my house,

1006
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:12,930
my cat's nice. Cats exemplify for a
hoarder. They exemplify easy love,

1007
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:14,610
easiest way to get love.

1008
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:18,510
It's easy to investing in a human
relationship and a cat is a survivor.

1009
00:54:18,511 --> 00:54:21,150
Like cats will scrap to any level.

1010
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:25,380
Like they will not die like had to die
naturally like a human couldn't live

1011
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:30,090
other cat. Absolutely. The minute a cat
dies, the other guy going to eat you.

1012
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,850
Totally.
So we'll find like a bunch of,

1013
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:36,720
like their eyes are eating out and test
it thoroughly. Now cats are scrapped, man.

1014
00:54:36,721 --> 00:54:40,260
It just try it. Oh my God. So that's
like code changes it for you. Yeah.

1015
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,510
We had an animal expert telling
me one time, she's like,

1016
00:54:42,511 --> 00:54:44,790
you know when a cat's up there looking
at your face when you're asleep,

1017
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:48,570
it's weight. It's, it's literally
waiting for your last breath. That's not,

1018
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,000
it doesn't love you.
It's not there to hang out with you.

1019
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,320
It's there to fucking kill you.

1020
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:56,400
How many people get eaten by the cats
after they die? I'm sure there's,

1021
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,520
I'm sure there's a bunch. I don't
know. I bet it is pretty common, right?

1022
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:03,390
Someone look, I also though dogs do
that as well. The people when they die.

1023
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:07,950
Absolutely. If a dog's left in a
apartment by with only you to eat,

1024
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,150
they're going to eat you. He goes back to,
it goes back to my boy, Ronnie. I mean,

1025
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,290
you got to do what you gotta do to
survive. Cats are gonna do the same thing.

1026
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:17,550
Animals will do it. So are people, man,

1027
00:55:17,551 --> 00:55:19,740
you got to do what you gotta do and
when you're pushed to that limit,

1028
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,410
you got to do what you gotta
remind me not to Piss that guy off.

1029
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:27,030
People stays in solitary for five years.
Thinking about kicking a dude's. I did a,

1030
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,640
I did stern the other day and he was
like, man, you must be really tough guy.

1031
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,610
And I was like, nope, my guys are. I'm
not, was like, I've never thrown a fit.

1032
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,710
I've never thrown a punch in my life,

1033
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:38,330
but I don't have to because I guess I'm
really tough dude behind me. You know,

1034
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:39,481
if you're a Douche bag,

1035
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:42,020
most of the time you never going to have
to hit anybody if you're not a Douche

1036
00:55:42,021 --> 00:55:45,570
bag, rather I, you know, at
one time, like a nice person.

1037
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,990
How often does it really going to come
up? I don't think. I mean, I hope never.

1038
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:52,080
Yeah, most likely. I mean, someone else's.

1039
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,890
My wife's gonna fucking hit
me before someone else gets
a chance. Does she throw?

1040
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,530
She would. Yeah. She's a tough
girl. She's a very tough,

1041
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:03,450
now you were in the ditch. He got beat
up by this fucking guy and that was,

1042
00:56:03,451 --> 00:56:08,340
how do you go from that to cleaning?
Crazy. Beautiful. You'll laugh from me.

1043
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,790
I actually, I wanted to,
I really enjoy old people.

1044
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:15,150
I think their stories are fascinating and
so I actually wanted to start a senior

1045
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:18,390
relocation business, which is moving old
ladies and I was like, that'd be neat.

1046
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,630
You get to sit down with them, sort
through this stuff here. They're old,

1047
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,160
hear their stories and it was it for me.
It was the great, Whoa, whoa. You like,

1048
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:26,640
you were like seeking out
the stories of old ladies.

1049
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,430
They're fascinating old ladies that like
their husbands have died in the war and

1050
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:32,500
they never got remarried.
They have all this cool shit.

1051
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:34,600
Their stories are fascinating.
Like amazing.

1052
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:37,240
I was thought that'd be a cool podcast
just to have one old lady from a

1053
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:39,810
neighborhood each week to just
come in a depressed. The fucking,

1054
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:42,220
I like this one lady when they
dentistry from me, I was talking,

1055
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:45,340
I was helping her clean her garage out
and her husband had died and we were in,

1056
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:47,650
he had just died of Alzheimer's.
It was really sad.

1057
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,950
And we started talking and I realized
she had a tattoo on her wrist,

1058
00:56:50,951 --> 00:56:55,810
some numbers. And I was
like, Yep. And I was like,

1059
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:57,820
do you mind me asking about
that? And she's like, oh sure.

1060
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:02,770
And she starts talking and she
clearly describes the dude.

1061
00:57:02,771 --> 00:57:04,960
I mean her husband or
her father is ironic.

1062
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:07,510
Her father and her brother died
in the concentration camps,

1063
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:12,010
but she met her husband there in a
concentration camp. They get to America,

1064
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:15,130
they refine each other in America.
They have 50 years together, all that.

1065
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:18,220
He died of Alzheimer's and she
said, I can still, I, she goes,

1066
00:57:18,221 --> 00:57:22,120
I could pick out the guy,
the u s soldier that opened a door to our,

1067
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,150
to whatever, you know the
box they were in. She goes,

1068
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,270
I can see the day we were saved.
And she,

1069
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,010
and it was about a 30 minute story
explaining this guy and she's,

1070
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:33,820
the minute that I realized we were free
and like those stories to me are fucking

1071
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:35,500
amazing. Right. Amazing.

1072
00:57:35,501 --> 00:57:38,200
And then she was upset because her husband
died from Alzheimer's and she's like,

1073
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,900
I mean it's 80 year old lady basically
saying to me, fuck Alzheimer's.

1074
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:44,290
I mean we beat, we beat
Hitler, we beat everything.

1075
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,260
And now this damned disease,
it takes my husband.

1076
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:51,190
And it was a very honest and very just
fascinating moment. And so for me,

1077
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:52,720
like I love shit like that.

1078
00:57:52,721 --> 00:57:54,310
And so that's why I wanted
to hang out with old ladies.

1079
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,370
Like I'm net my generation,
I ain't going have anything like that man.

1080
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:02,920
Like that's, I mean she saw
cars, she saw like, you know,

1081
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:08,350
I mean, yeah, she taught me anything.
She was, if you ask, they will talk,

1082
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,480
but they're not gonna. They're not
pretentious like us. They're just,

1083
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,210
they're not going to tell you
shit if you ask, they will answer.

1084
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,310
So when did you get into this hobby
of talking to old ladies about?

1085
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:20,490
Always it always kind of trippy grandma.

1086
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,610
My grandpa always got, I mean, makes
sense. I think they're fascinating.

1087
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,910
I think it's interesting and I'm not
a big reader. I like to do lists.

1088
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:30,850
I'm a listener. That's why probably are
so good for me. I love listening to stuff.

1089
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,660
I love fascinating stories. And I lived
actually the first year out of college,

1090
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:36,550
I lived in my mom.
My mom moved to England,

1091
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:39,700
so I lived in her apartment and
it was in a retirement community.

1092
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:41,170
So my first year out of college,

1093
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:46,430
I was the only dude under like 60 didn't
even try to bang you. One guy did a guy,

1094
00:58:46,431 --> 00:58:50,440
Dick Kidding,
how much did you pay 100 bucks

1095
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,300
now it was uh, you know,
so you went from that why?

1096
00:58:55,330 --> 00:59:00,010
When I tried it and the thing was,
yeah, in my town there was an old,

1097
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,540
there was a business.
It was very,

1098
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:05,050
very good at senior relocation
and I could never beat them.

1099
00:59:05,051 --> 00:59:07,690
I couldn't compete against them. So for
me it was a totally a business decision.

1100
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:10,870
I went to this competitor and I
said, what do you not do? She goes,

1101
00:59:10,871 --> 00:59:13,420
we won't clean the messy ones. And I was
like, well, that's what I'm going to do.

1102
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,410
Whoa. And so it was strictly, I
couldn't beat this woman in business,

1103
00:59:17,411 --> 00:59:21,530
the lady that owned the bigger company.
So I had to just do what didn't do.

1104
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:26,420
Wow. How clever you are you. That's a
pragmatic dude. My grandpa was always,

1105
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:26,901
he just said,

1106
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:31,901
you find out what no one wants to do and
then do that and they'll pay you a lot

1107
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:33,280
of money.

1108
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,230
Grandfather and your father school
fucking great. And it was great advice,

1109
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,300
but they were, listen kid,
you're not good looking.

1110
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:42,190
You fucking do what nobody
else is willing to do.

1111
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:46,870
I'm glad I found that out at 14 and not
at 44 I know, but it's so fun. It's good.

1112
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:51,610
It's kind of broken to say to
your son, like, loosen my jeans,

1113
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:56,140
Suck Soda, Yours. Pretty much.
Pretty much room. It is what it is.

1114
00:59:56,141 --> 00:59:58,780
Let's move on.
Get on strategy on what you can do.

1115
00:59:58,781 --> 01:00:01,360
So do you have a lot of self
confidence issues because of this?

1116
01:00:01,361 --> 01:00:02,890
Now I'm very confident.
Yeah.

1117
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:07,810
He was telling earlier that's his dad
will know about your looks. You're not.

1118
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,070
If you're interested in my look,

1119
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:13,060
totally missed the point. Like
I'm not, I'm not handsome. I'm

1120
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:15,570
see. Looks. Yeah, that right there
you, you said you're not handsome.

1121
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:19,080
Why don't you think you're a very
handsome man. He's not a bad looking dude,

1122
01:00:19,081 --> 01:00:23,070
but I think not freakishly
ugly. You look clean, cut

1123
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,600
personality and don't be
freakishly ugly. Yeah. I never,

1124
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:28,860
I did fine.

1125
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,170
I'd never gone without a nice looking
woman and they would never attracted to my

1126
01:00:34,171 --> 01:00:36,900
looks. They were attracted to my
confidence in what I do. What I,

1127
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,590
what I actually do for people. Tom
Cruise movie, he could be in Magnolia.

1128
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:43,500
They can give you like one
of the guys that created,

1129
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:44,990
I don't know how tall Tom Cruise,

1130
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,360
but I hear that I'm like five foot
two so he might be bigger than that.

1131
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,390
Let me tell you, you're a lot fucking
bigger than I thought you're going to be.

1132
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,340
Okay.
That sounds weird.

1133
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,333
Now

1134
01:00:55,610 --> 01:01:00,500
he's got so excited seeing
the like girth to that.

1135
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:03,940
Um, yeah. I was really
excited to talk to you, man.

1136
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,990
For sure. This is you. I mean this is
the kind of stuff you wanted to, I mean,

1137
01:01:06,991 --> 01:01:09,480
I hope I get blown away.

1138
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,150
Pass for sure.
I'm,

1139
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:15,280
I love the stories of people feeling
that they're going crazy and then pulling

1140
01:01:15,281 --> 01:01:18,430
themselves out. I've, I've been really
lucky with my addictions in the past,

1141
01:01:18,431 --> 01:01:20,470
but I certainly know that I'm susceptible.

1142
01:01:20,471 --> 01:01:24,010
That's why I stay away from video
games. I've never really gambled. Yeah.

1143
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,090
The only thing I've ever gambled on was
playing pool and I was never good enough

1144
01:01:28,091 --> 01:01:30,910
to win any money or to be like
a threat, you know, like it was,

1145
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:35,520
it was a bull horn guys are dangerous. Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah. But I knew like what,

1146
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:37,630
what I'm saying is I knew
what I was capable of,

1147
01:01:37,631 --> 01:01:40,270
so I don't have a big
enough ego to get roped in.

1148
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,670
One of the ways that guys
get roped in his, uh,

1149
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,600
you'll play a guy and he'll barely lose
to you and then they'll start trying to

1150
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:49,680
raise the stakes or he'll barely
beat you and you think that he,

1151
01:01:49,681 --> 01:01:50,550
you think you're away,

1152
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,950
you're a hat and you think you can get
back at them and then see drags you into

1153
01:01:53,951 --> 01:01:54,790
this deep water.

1154
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:56,950
And then all of a sudden he starts
running out and then he starts playing

1155
01:01:56,951 --> 01:01:59,800
perfect pooling. You're like, what the
fuck? Just, Oh, you just got hustled.

1156
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,310
He pretended to be a certain level and
really he was much better than that.

1157
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:07,600
I was always, I'm sorry, what was, I was
always real aware that I wasn't that good,

1158
01:02:07,601 --> 01:02:11,380
so you couldn't do that to me and I knew
exactly how good I was at all times.

1159
01:02:11,381 --> 01:02:16,381
It's like your bullshit detector is
greater than your urge to gamble.

1160
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,273
Well yeah,
yeah.

1161
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:21,750
Got A, you've got a bigger high
off of calling that guy out

1162
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,060
then you did off of beating
them. Well, you know,

1163
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:25,980
not even just calling them out
and just being aware of it,

1164
01:02:25,981 --> 01:02:29,060
someone's busting moves. Yeah. You
know, being aware that there's some,

1165
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,650
some fuckery is going down.

1166
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,930
Yeah. But that's, I go
back to the self worth.

1167
01:02:32,931 --> 01:02:35,750
Like I think everything in life
is about trying to get self worth,

1168
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:39,770
trying to get attention and like, what
am I, me, me, me, me, me. And so for you,

1169
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:43,160
you got more credit in your own head for
calling that guy out and figuring out

1170
01:02:43,161 --> 01:02:46,010
the situation then you would
have for beating them? Probably.

1171
01:02:46,011 --> 01:02:47,090
I never thought of it that way.

1172
01:02:47,091 --> 01:02:51,090
I always just thought of it as like a
natural survival instinct. I mean it's,

1173
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:56,270
you know, like you could,
you could, I mean like in a
fight, I always say there's a,

1174
01:02:56,330 --> 01:03:00,590
there's a, it's one thing to quit and it's
another teacher to strategically stop.

1175
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:05,360
If I'm fighting one of your buddies,
you know, that's not quitting.

1176
01:03:05,361 --> 01:03:08,900
That's strategically stopping. I know I'm
going to die if I die, if I don't stop,

1177
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:10,370
if I just run away.

1178
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:12,180
Well,
the idea of saying don't quit.

1179
01:03:12,181 --> 01:03:14,880
It's really stupid because that means
so one guy is going to probably beat the

1180
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:17,310
other guy that death. This is
not really necessary. I mean,

1181
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:18,960
how mad are you at somebody?
I mean,

1182
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:21,750
I can understand what I was trying to
kill you and you're using self defense

1183
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,630
using martial arts when you beat someone
to death. I understand that. I am, uh,

1184
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:28,050
some guy tried to rob you and he pulls a
knife on you and you get the knife away

1185
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:29,910
from that guy and you beat him to death.
I'm with you.

1186
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,820
I'm on your side 100% but
that's not what you want to do.

1187
01:03:32,821 --> 01:03:35,240
Most of the time you get in a fight
with someone, they just mad, you know,

1188
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,110
they don't want to beat anybody.
Never that guy you're beaten up.

1189
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,560
So there's a good time to,

1190
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:41,250
there's a good time to stop and
say you're sorry and want to do.

1191
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,940
It's fucking pounding on you. And that
guy should let you go and you should,

1192
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:45,840
you should say you're sorry.

1193
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:47,880
And that guy should let you go and
everybody should be cool about it.

1194
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:51,540
And that's how it should go down. You
know, that's the correct way is to quit.

1195
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:54,450
To me, it's always a
balance of like, how do you,

1196
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:58,500
how do you get that self worth that you
give yourself credit for it and then you

1197
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:02,520
move on and, and, and, and I just don't
get into arguments where you're right,

1198
01:04:02,521 --> 01:04:05,550
but the other guy can kick your ass.
Yeah, no, dude, you're totally right.

1199
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:08,070
Don't get in those audience bad.
That's not,

1200
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:12,080
especially if you think of like
a physical, but, uh, I dunno,

1201
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,100
human conflict, man. It would be,

1202
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:17,400
it'd be a lot better if most people
knew how to fight. It's like,

1203
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:20,940
I feel I'm not a big fan of gun control.
And I feel,

1204
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,280
especially in this day and age,

1205
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:28,470
that there are so many guns out there
that for you to try to say that guns

1206
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:31,410
shouldn't be available for
civilians to me seems preposterous.

1207
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,940
It seems to me that,
you know,

1208
01:04:32,941 --> 01:04:36,300
you can't control the population
and periods of civil unrest.

1209
01:04:36,301 --> 01:04:38,900
We know that's true.
We know that you, you,

1210
01:04:38,901 --> 01:04:42,930
you're saying that a family should be
completely vulnerable and in cases where

1211
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:46,410
were things go terribly wrong when home
invasions and things along those lines.

1212
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:49,620
Fuck you. That's ridiculous. I'm not
a big fan of that. But you personally,

1213
01:04:49,621 --> 01:04:53,400
do you have guns? Yes. Yes, I have
cousins. Yeah. Um, but it, you know,

1214
01:04:53,401 --> 01:04:55,380
I'm also not a fan of shooting people.
You know,

1215
01:04:55,381 --> 01:04:58,320
I don't think you should go around
killing people if you don't have to,

1216
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,520
but you know,

1217
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:03,240
someone stepping in to tell you that you
shouldn't have guns and you shouldn't

1218
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:06,260
be able to protect yourself.
Yeah. It's the thing,

1219
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:10,110
and you can take that across
anywhere. Yeah, for sure.

1220
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:11,190
I don't want to have an abortion,

1221
01:05:11,191 --> 01:05:13,420
but I don't want to not have
the right to either. Exactly.

1222
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:16,430
Well and I didn't get into that.
Yeah.

1223
01:05:16,431 --> 01:05:20,200
In preggers it's since been a first
frustrating how we got on the subject.

1224
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:24,830
W W w when got on the subject of guns.
It's just,

1225
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,780
it's a passionate issue. Yeah. I
try not to get personal pretty ever.

1226
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,750
It's not even a politics thing.
To me it's a personal liberty.

1227
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:35,830
I am not a fan of anyone coming
along and telling you what to do.

1228
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,710
As long as what you're doing is not
hurting me and not fucking up the

1229
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:43,060
environment, you know, polluting the
world. You know, killing puppies. Go,

1230
01:05:43,061 --> 01:05:43,570
go have fun.

1231
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:46,570
That comes up in hoarding a lot. They're
like, just leave me alone. I'm happy.

1232
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:50,260
Well just let me be what happened to
chuck and diapers and I'm like, yeah,

1233
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:53,890
but I'm like, you live in, I just
took 45,000 pounds of shit out of you.

1234
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:57,160
Your House, your own shit. Like the way
it like that. Do you put it by the doctor?

1235
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,370
Yeah.
By the time it's by the dumpsters.

1236
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:03,310
You really pull off 45,000 pounds
of fuel. Shit. Only 20 tons. I mean,

1237
01:06:03,311 --> 01:06:04,540
that's a wow.

1238
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,470
That's like 1000 pounds.

1239
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,650
That doesn't even make sense to me.
I'm not even registering that

1240
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,040
three of these rooms
full like to the roof.

1241
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,900
It's a lot of shit that, I mean,
think how big your shit is. Oh Man.

1242
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,790
How much of that would it take?
2000 pounds. I mean, it's coming.

1243
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,500
I always say it's commitment.
It's Ted Smell for the neighborhood.

1244
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:32,190
It's a very use Mallon.
I mean it's a very citrusy,

1245
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,040
it's very orange, orange, chocolate,

1246
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,770
orange orchard in his yard.
It's very citrusy.

1247
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:44,350
Orange chocolate milk coming. Acid
breaks down to be more orangy Chocolatey.

1248
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:48,940
That's crazy. For real or
not. If I go with yes there,

1249
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:52,760
so it doesn't even smell
bad. I'm not, to me

1250
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:57,210
I, the urine is what throws me off. A
urine would just fucking kill anything.

1251
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,690
Bird shit is the worst.
You're eight and they don't actually,

1252
01:07:00,691 --> 01:07:03,750
she's not actually shit. It's like an
acid. It's called your rate, your rate.

1253
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:06,720
I had a lady that did, uh, she
was a parrot hoarder. Oh God.

1254
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:07,710
And that was disgusting.

1255
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:09,630
Oh my God.
A pair of Warner

1256
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:14,270
brothers movie. Oh Man. I, I've

1257
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:14,990
seen it all man.

1258
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:19,990
Like this was a great story cause she had
like 80 and she had 86 birds and I had

1259
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:21,140
to take him,

1260
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:26,330
I had to transport him to a hotel for the
vet to look at them. And so these are,

1261
01:07:26,331 --> 01:07:30,560
I mean this is her life,
right? Fascinating woman. Like
we thought she was a bitch.

1262
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:34,250
Like she was just so angry and she loved
these birds and to point her husband

1263
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:38,300
was in a wheelchair and he couldn't, he
was ready to come home from the hospital,

1264
01:07:38,301 --> 01:07:41,720
but he couldn't come to the home
because of all the stuff we were like,

1265
01:07:41,721 --> 01:07:43,670
what a bitch, you know,
like what a horrible person.

1266
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,690
And so the first night we transport all
the birds to the hotel and I'm driving a

1267
01:07:47,691 --> 01:07:51,500
you on every other driving
a u haul through Seattle.
Like this is two years ago.

1268
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:52,640
I mean,
I just,

1269
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:56,120
and I was still making 12 bucks an hour
cleaning up shit at home and I'm like,

1270
01:07:56,121 --> 01:07:58,760
I mean, I was like, I would, I think
I did it for 500 bucks the whole show,

1271
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:01,730
like a whole episode. And I was like,
500 bucks is more than I've made in a,

1272
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:05,450
in a year, you know, so, so excited.
Driving a u haul with 86 birds,

1273
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:10,780
I get to the vet and I only have
84 birds to who died in transport.

1274
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,610
Oh, she's, and this lady,

1275
01:08:13,611 --> 01:08:16,790
this is her life right later we
found that as we clean more, more,

1276
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,970
she refused to talk to me. We have
a therapist on set always, uh, to,

1277
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,660
to make sure that their mental health is
just as strong as her physical health.

1278
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:26,090
And the more the therapist and
I start talking, I was like,

1279
01:08:26,091 --> 01:08:27,320
I don't think she likes men,
period.

1280
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:31,040
And the more if out it turns
out her husband beat the
shit out of her and that's

1281
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:34,670
why she had built this wall. She didn't
want to clean the house out. So he didn't,

1282
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:36,320
he would say back from the hospital,
she didn't want,

1283
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,180
she didn't want to come in because
he's going to be shit out of her again.

1284
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,600
And so we were like, oh we're
done. So we didn't clean the house.

1285
01:08:41,601 --> 01:08:44,090
We left it messy for
because it at that point,

1286
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,180
the worst thing we can do
for cleaning house right.

1287
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:49,070
And we really slowed down drastically.

1288
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:52,550
We just cleaned the garage cause I don't
want to get them in the house. Bummer.

1289
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:55,310
When you see people completely fucked up,
it's,

1290
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:57,680
I mean it does make you feel
better about your own life.

1291
01:08:57,681 --> 01:09:01,410
I'll say that you realize and that's why
people watch our show. It may mean it's,

1292
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:04,600
well people watch your show for
the water cooler talk. Oh it, yeah.

1293
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:07,750
Did you fucking see the cats for it?
When you hear it?

1294
01:09:07,751 --> 01:09:10,580
About 45,000 pounds of Shit.
Do you actually show the shit?

1295
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:13,100
You show me how you see me picking it up.
Bac me Shoveling,

1296
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:18,170
shoveling human should the dead cats is
one thing that you very rarely see human

1297
01:09:18,411 --> 01:09:21,890
shit on TV that they'll show. I mean
they'll show it smeared against the wall.

1298
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,940
There's one shot of me on the
Internet where I'm living.

1299
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:28,850
I'm just sitting there like pointing at
a diaper and there's shit smeared all

1300
01:09:28,851 --> 01:09:31,850
behind the wall behind me and I was like,
wow, I can't make me put that on there.

1301
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,700
People posted all over Facebook and
everything. Well you guys are in a and e,

1302
01:09:35,701 --> 01:09:37,330
right?
Rainy nights at nine.

1303
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:41,900
It's cable and cables not
subject to FCC regulations.

1304
01:09:41,901 --> 01:09:42,920
A lot of people don't know that.

1305
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,910
That's why shows like the shield got away
with being so crazy. I was like shit.

1306
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:50,360
And Louis Louis CK show though
it gets away with being so crazy.

1307
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:52,820
They're not really, um, it's,

1308
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:56,430
people think that only like HBO is a
lot of swear really cables labs where

1309
01:09:56,650 --> 01:10:00,020
they're not really regulated by the
FCC because they're a pay service.

1310
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,940
We edit out a lot on orders.
Obviously.

1311
01:10:01,941 --> 01:10:03,800
There's a lot of stuff we just
don't show that. I'm sure.

1312
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:06,590
Would you like to show it? Yeah,
I leave me. If it was my show,

1313
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:09,980
I would change it up a little bit.
I like what I would get more into the sh.

1314
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:13,160
I mean I would get into the like
instead of showing up before and after,

1315
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:17,690
I would put a half hour on the decision
to shit, you're going to our show,

1316
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:21,470
like let's really dig into,
well how bad is your life?

1317
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:25,550
I don't sugar coat that you got raped
by your uncle. Like just fucking say it.

1318
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,890
Like I didn't know how bad physical and
sexual abuses in this country. Like it's,

1319
01:10:29,891 --> 01:10:32,180
it's ramp,
it's still me and I had no idea and like,

1320
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:34,460
like let's get into it and
like, let's not, I mean we,

1321
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:35,990
we shot what was the cause of all this?

1322
01:10:35,991 --> 01:10:39,820
A lot of time if you see shit on the wall,
they got raped as a kid. I mean like,

1323
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,370
it's awful. Like now walk in the
house, I'll be like, Oh, who raped you?

1324
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,930
Your uncle or your dad? Well I did
that one time and that he's like, oh,

1325
01:10:44,931 --> 01:10:49,280
it was my uncle had, you know, and I was
like, oh fuck. That's real. Like wow.

1326
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,680
It was a joke on me as a bad joke,
but it was a joke.

1327
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:53,510
That's how you crack jokes
and we go over people's house.

1328
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:58,700
[inaudible] you're always taking
a leap of faith of the rape joke.

1329
01:11:00,261 --> 01:11:05,090
But I've found out that's going to be
someone's signature on a message board.

1330
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:09,200
Oh God. I'm always embarrassed when
they post that stuff cause ain't,

1331
01:11:09,201 --> 01:11:11,030
he doesn't listen to the podcast
and said like, I'll get it.

1332
01:11:11,031 --> 01:11:14,010
Someone will post that, you know, they'll
post always take a leap of faith on

1333
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:18,720
a raped him,
listen to the park on ABC.

1334
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:23,040
You just don't give a shit. I'll give
it 100% I don't give a fuck sauce.

1335
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:26,690
That's his point on Miami. You
know, if he, if you don't know,

1336
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:31,600
you get involved with I'm a good person
but I'm honest. Well that's, I mean,

1337
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:35,580
I mean I don't hold it back a brutally
honest. I am there to help him.

1338
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:38,010
I will do it in a different style.
Yeah.

1339
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:41,850
I mean I will always be able
to say whatever you want
and your message board on

1340
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:45,570
a blog, on a video and then police it
a little bit. But they're pretty good.

1341
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,280
They're pretty used to me.
Well you,

1342
01:11:47,281 --> 01:11:50,580
your story just so fascinating and he no
one should put any restrictions on you.

1343
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:54,570
You have your best intentions in mind.
Oh, I ended up my day. I'm gonna help you.

1344
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:56,870
I want to help someone, period.
But when you hear like God,

1345
01:11:56,871 --> 01:11:59,500
like you talk about how there was one
point in time you're thinking about

1346
01:11:59,501 --> 01:12:03,900
sucking a Dick for money. I mean, that's
of course not. Of course you're not.

1347
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:05,820
And it's important when important,

1348
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:08,710
when someone meets a guy like you and sees
you got your shit together, it's, it's,

1349
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,570
that's a good lesson for someone to learn.
My wife doesn't love that story. I bet.

1350
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,200
I bet she doesn't man. But she does
it. But Hey, I mean, it's reality.

1351
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,900
It doesn't make you gay means
you were fucking Desperado.

1352
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:22,310
And I think once you suck a
dick that makes you, for sure.
Yes. At one time. I mean,

1353
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:27,270
if a guy sucks your Dick, I um, yeah.

1354
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:31,620
You think so? There was a guy that came
back from my run. I mean, I've had a lot,

1355
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,810
I've had some women that were
pretty awful. It's like my day.

1356
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:37,470
They were like manly, just
gross, disgusting, disgusting.

1357
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:40,480
But there's still feminine. They
still had double x chromosome. Yeah,

1358
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,570
but that's it. That's it. That's all.

1359
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:44,940
I mean technically they were
so you're not proud of that.

1360
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:48,660
You would be more proud of that
then a guy sucking your dick or no,

1361
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:52,100
I mean he knew Dick sucked is
getting your dig socks. I mean,

1362
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,820
I'm not worried about case.

1363
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:56,770
I'm never worried about the quality of
the Dick Sucking when it does happen.

1364
01:12:56,771 --> 01:12:59,250
Now I could give a shit.
I'm very concerned with the quality.

1365
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:01,710
There's nothing worse than a horrible,
horrendous,

1366
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:06,620
horrendous blow job was a terrible thing.
No one should have to get self.

1367
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,460
Well I did have one bad one.

1368
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,430
How could you not have one battle at
one bad one and she was like a life that

1369
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:15,900
you live in and she thought it was like
she thought I man, not as good as that.

1370
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:20,040
You haven't had one crazy blow. At
least one shitty ones. She was like,

1371
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:21,040
she thought she was great.

1372
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:23,730
Like clearly people told her she was
wonderful and it was clearly not.

1373
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:28,950
What was she doing was like too much
biding and too much. Too much teeth.

1374
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,110
Ooh, likes teeth. Is there a guy
out there that you to mother's Day,

1375
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:35,640
but the second I feel team game over.
I always say if you,

1376
01:13:35,641 --> 01:13:38,270
if you're thinking teeth,
thank finger in the ass hole,

1377
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:43,170
it's easy fingernail in the assholes.
Yeah. When you go to your house,

1378
01:13:43,171 --> 01:13:46,850
is your house super? Trust me on
that. Yeah. Say that again. Don't.

1379
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:50,100
If you go out there and you're gonna set
some guy's dick talking to the ladies.

1380
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:52,730
Ladies, don't bite it. Don't buy it.

1381
01:13:52,731 --> 01:13:55,510
It just play with his asshole instead
play with his asshole and stuff.

1382
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,330
You'll be much fairer fingernails

1383
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:02,320
and giving advice to the lady.
That's what you like.

1384
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:06,810
If you're giving me a blow
job, but you're not. Wow.

1385
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:10,490
This is amazing. Now you know, now
you know I'm homeboys honestly.

1386
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:14,680
So when you go your handy right now,
the fucking sports are lighting up.

1387
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,850
Do you know that Mac passing,

1388
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,540
he's asking people to a
point where there's one hole.

1389
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:23,920
Do you know that he represents your
network? Do you know that, hey,

1390
01:14:23,921 --> 01:14:28,800
I bet you 18 of the 24 would
prefer the 1824 the agents.

1391
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:33,220
Is that the good age demo for apparently
and 18 to 49 is where the money is,

1392
01:14:33,221 --> 01:14:36,250
right? It's male. 18 to 49 they
spend the most money, you know,

1393
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:40,540
spends the most money. Gay dudes, most of
them don't have kids. Dinks dual income.

1394
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:44,840
No kids, cause we call dual
income. No kids, ton of mine,

1395
01:14:44,841 --> 01:14:47,110
man and marketing. That's what
we called. Are you allowed to be?

1396
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:51,220
That's not a derogatory mark. That date
back two gay guys feel uncomfortable,

1397
01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:56,000
but that dank sounds like you guys don't
care. It sounds like a time. Hey guys,

1398
01:14:56,001 --> 01:14:58,240
hey give a shit about the rest
of the world. Gay guys are happy.

1399
01:14:58,241 --> 01:15:00,010
They're enjoying their life.
They don't care about anyone else.

1400
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:01,240
That's a big generalization.

1401
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:04,000
I bet a lot of gay guys with a gun in
their mouth right now that disagree with

1402
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:04,540
you.

1403
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:07,090
I actually had a lot of buddies that are
gay and they don't have time to think

1404
01:15:07,091 --> 01:15:09,760
about it. They just out sucking Dick.
They're fucking apartment all day.

1405
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:13,090
When you go to your house
is your house like spotless?

1406
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:18,091
Like do you own a spoon that's in a
glass case and like everybody added and

1407
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,170
sanitizers on every
wall? We, I was, we were,

1408
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,990
my wife and I were extremely just
anal retentive and then we have,

1409
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,630
we've too young,

1410
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:28,630
we have a two year old and a five month
old and I mean you can't control that

1411
01:15:28,631 --> 01:15:31,900
and they just, they just take
over your house. I mean leg,

1412
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:35,360
I mean I try to teach my kid to put the
Legos in the right place and the books

1413
01:15:35,361 --> 01:15:38,590
and the right place and I had developed
this whole system. It's bullshit.

1414
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:40,360
I mean two year old is a two year old,
he doesn't care.

1415
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:43,630
So I've just had to accept like I'm
going to have kids and a messy house.

1416
01:15:43,631 --> 01:15:44,350
It is what it is.

1417
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:49,300
How the people who have kids become crazy
Germaphobes how is that even possible?

1418
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:53,830
Protect
how many is a very nice guy.

1419
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:58,120
Always like Towelie.
I used to see him a lot in la.

1420
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:01,090
I'd always see him at a restaurant
with John Mendoza, this one restaurant.

1421
01:16:01,091 --> 01:16:03,880
They frequent it. Super Nice Guy.
Like couldn't be a nicer guy,

1422
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:08,190
but you know he's got that. He's got
serious OCD about cleaning his hand.

1423
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:12,220
Fist bump man, he stopped giving fist
bumps. Doesn't do anymore. He can't do it.

1424
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:14,710
I have a buddy to met him and he
said he was just, he did the elbow.

1425
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,020
He used to give fist bumps. He can't
shake a hand to save his life. No,

1426
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:20,860
he won't shake your hand.

1427
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:26,040
Well my friend was looking at his house
was went to his house is for sale and

1428
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:30,610
great house is perfectly fine and he
didn't know that it was how he Mandela's

1429
01:16:30,611 --> 01:16:31,310
house.
He didn't know.

1430
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:36,130
They didn't have any like family
pictures on the wall the because it, no.

1431
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,000
Then he figured it out.
That was a,

1432
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:43,120
that was like a glove that he would
put other big thing, but it wasn't big.

1433
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:47,050
It looked like a balloon. He didn't
blow it up with his legos air. Remember?

1434
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:51,680
Well he went into his closet and it was
filled with hand sanitizers like can you

1435
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:55,750
whole closet fit? And they were
like, yeah, that much alcohol.

1436
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:58,930
And his wife goes,
I stopped breathing for a second.

1437
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,500
It was like I'd seen something scary.
Like I just looked at it madness.

1438
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:06,220
I just woke up and then they left. They
like, thank you, thank you. Got to go.

1439
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,070
They couldn't buy the house
from a hoarder's mentality,

1440
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:13,100
except they're so focused
on the Massey side, the OCD,

1441
01:17:13,101 --> 01:17:16,790
and a lot of hoarding believers or not
sure. What would you do? You don't.

1442
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:19,160
You just done let him live
his life, man. Jesus Christ.

1443
01:17:19,161 --> 01:17:23,600
You would upset him so much by trying
to change him, making him shake hands.

1444
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:27,350
Just let them be, man. Oh my God,
he's fine. I mean, it's strange.

1445
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,360
Does he ever have to
worry about him cheating?

1446
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:34,220
God knew we never put his dick in
any, no way. I saw him at Caesars.

1447
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:37,400
CAESARS is never going
to leave. He, I mean,

1448
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:38,840
he worked the crowd like you wouldn't he?

1449
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,550
He could always pull people from the
whole audience and he'd he these callbacks

1450
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:46,580
from an hour ago, you know, and he was
just so hilarious. He was good dude.

1451
01:17:46,581 --> 01:17:49,940
I was a kid. I mean, I was 24 when
I saw this. I was blown away by him.

1452
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:53,660
I saw how he meant Dell. Uh, let me see
them, a bunch of his different specials,

1453
01:17:53,661 --> 01:17:56,990
but I had one that I was passing around
a bunch of my friends when I was like,

1454
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,280
I guess I was probably like 19 or 20. I
don't think I've even started comedy yet.

1455
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:04,340
And how he man dealt was hilarious.
It was really funny.

1456
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,040
How do you make that decision? I'm
going to do comedy. Like what? Uh,

1457
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:09,290
I got talked into it.

1458
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:12,710
I had a bunch of friends that I
used to do martial arts with and uh,

1459
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:14,660
make them laugh in the locker room,
stuff like that.

1460
01:18:14,661 --> 01:18:18,440
And then you were always funny. Not
really. I just would see funny shit.

1461
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:21,380
Like most of the time I wasn't funny,
but then when I would see something funny,

1462
01:18:21,381 --> 01:18:25,640
it would be pretty funny. You
know, I just, you know, I had it,

1463
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:31,040
when you're the type of person who's
I'm sort of anti bullshit and you, you,

1464
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:33,200
you look for bullshit everywhere you go.

1465
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,680
And when you realize that someone's
not calling this bullshit,

1466
01:18:36,681 --> 01:18:39,740
you almost feel obligated to, you almost
feel like you got to, Hey, what is this?

1467
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:43,150
And a lot of times when you do
that, it's funny. The truth. Yeah.

1468
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:46,520
And that's what I realized early on there
were certain things that I would say

1469
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:50,540
that would get laughs cause they were
honest and then I would play on it and I

1470
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:53,210
need, I mean I knew you from
any of course new fear factor,

1471
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:55,590
but I knew you from that radio.

1472
01:18:55,591 --> 01:18:58,610
It was a talk radio show or a
day or when you think back on it,

1473
01:18:58,611 --> 01:19:00,500
what amazing cast.
It was a great Jesus Christ.

1474
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:03,380
If there's anything that I've ever been
like super lucky out in this life is a

1475
01:19:03,381 --> 01:19:06,080
lot of things. But one of them was
news all over you. I mean that was,

1476
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:09,560
I was 26 it was when it first started.

1477
01:19:09,561 --> 01:19:14,210
I think it was 25 or 26 maybe 27
that's the latest I need. It was, um,

1478
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:18,540
yeah,
it was 1994 we show how's it too?

1479
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:22,550
I had no acting experience other than
than a couple episodes of this other show

1480
01:19:22,551 --> 01:19:25,510
that was on Fox. Then all sudden
I'm working with Phil Hartman.

1481
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,130
I remember sitting
there at the table read.

1482
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:30,430
I mean you just keep going
through Jesus more and more.

1483
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:33,240
Tierney was such a good actress.
Like you'd be doing that.

1484
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:35,150
You don't even know her name.
Yeah,

1485
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:39,140
she would be doing scenes and you would
forget that you're in a scene like you

1486
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:43,190
go, oh you're, you're acting like, whoa.
You just get, so she was so good at it.

1487
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:47,540
She was so good at it. You could just
snap it on. She liked this intense,

1488
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:50,750
like a acting focus. It was
pretty shocking. So I heard you.

1489
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:53,360
I always saw you on that show.
Then of course, second fear factor.

1490
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:57,890
Then the man show and like, you know all
of that stuff and then I'm good dude.

1491
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:01,090
I heard you one time randomly on serious.

1492
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:04,280
I was driving cross country and it was a,
I think it was,

1493
01:20:04,281 --> 01:20:06,590
we're all dog and it was a one a year.

1494
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:11,900
One of your just bits about
an old Texas oil tycoon.

1495
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,830
Oh, Mary Nicole Smith, Anna Nicole Smith,

1496
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,870
the funniest ice almost shit myself,
there's a couple of bandwidth,

1497
01:20:18,871 --> 01:20:23,490
so if you find that on Youtube,
it's on my CD.

1498
01:20:23,491 --> 01:20:26,520
If you find it on Youtube,
does a shit version of gold version of it.

1499
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:30,270
You should learn this was
live and you were just,

1500
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:33,500
you were just fucking go in with
it and you were clearly just beat.

1501
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,910
The people in the audience were digging
it and so you just kept going more and

1502
01:20:35,911 --> 01:20:38,220
more and more. It was a crazy,
but it was a long, it was,

1503
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,580
it was a good 20 minutes story
and it was the funniest. I mean,

1504
01:20:41,581 --> 01:20:44,190
I had never laughed so
hard. I get a car. Right.

1505
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:49,650
You got to put that on that
first CD. Yeah. If you go to the,

1506
01:20:49,651 --> 01:20:51,540
I'm going to be dead some days.
My first CD,

1507
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:55,160
it's on that one and I'm not trying
to talk to [inaudible]. It was,

1508
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:58,310
it was the brutal lunch because it was
funny because it was fucking true. Yeah.

1509
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:02,910
Well, my, my point was, you know,
people are like, oh, this poor guy,

1510
01:21:02,911 --> 01:21:06,480
he's old and he's rich and she's
going to take him for his money.

1511
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:10,920
And my point was like, don't you think
he knows clearly you got I right is old.

1512
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,650
He made $1 billion from scratch.
You know,

1513
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:17,190
chances are it is a tad crafty dying
with dealt with knees and my face and I'm

1514
01:21:17,191 --> 01:21:21,180
fine with it. He was just having to do
all this crazy shit to him before he died.

1515
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:25,350
It was fun. That was a Mitzi shore hater
man. We just, sure I hated that bit.

1516
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:28,470
Mitzi shore used to tell him we stop
feeling, man. It was a funny thing.

1517
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:33,080
I mean to short used to hate dudes when
I was do jokes about old men are old

1518
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:35,870
creepy old men. She's woman who
wrote the comedy store. Okay.

1519
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,660
She would never know Pauly shore's mom.
Tell me never to do those jokes.

1520
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,220
There's that one in a bit about who have
to, she didn't like that one either.

1521
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:47,730
I've found like when I would go to
pitch ain't I'll go to PJ and e and idea

1522
01:21:47,731 --> 01:21:50,850
about a new show or something.
And then like this one guys is like,

1523
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:53,700
that's a horrible idea. Don't ever
tell anyone that idea again. Whoa.

1524
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:57,000
That's always the best idea. I've found.
Like if an executive session sucks,

1525
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,130
goats go digital and do it
cause it'll fucking kid.

1526
01:22:00,131 --> 01:22:03,570
I had an idea once I pitched over
the phone and the guy actually like

1527
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:07,280
said, you're kidding, right? You
did. Did you waste my time with this?

1528
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:10,850
And I was like, wow. All right.
I guess he didn't like my idea.

1529
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:13,910
I pitched over the phone, he was like,
I go, I have this idea for a show.

1530
01:22:13,911 --> 01:22:15,620
It's just a silly idea,

1531
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:20,770
but it's like it's a comedy and it's
about these girls that work at a bikini

1532
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:26,590
pizza place in the day called pizza
sluts and at night they fight crime and

1533
01:22:29,721 --> 01:22:30,620
they're there.

1534
01:22:30,621 --> 01:22:35,621
They're super hot chicks
that are recruited by the
police force and trained to

1535
01:22:36,381 --> 01:22:40,370
infiltrate into areas where
other cops could never get chin.

1536
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,880
Cause people would never believe that
these hot girls were actually seeking it.

1537
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,490
Let's,
we're actually secret agents.

1538
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:48,410
Why did they have to work at the pizza
place and then a full time job though?

1539
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,240
Well because they have a cover and
they get to get to see them in their

1540
01:22:53,241 --> 01:22:56,900
underwear is the smart county
and fucking dude was mad at me.

1541
01:22:57,050 --> 01:23:00,140
This is chuck peace. Dude was mad
as a long time ago by the way.

1542
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:03,140
And the dude was mad at me. I was like,
I think that would be a silly show.

1543
01:23:03,141 --> 01:23:06,910
Like you don't think they could be like
a ton of jokes and you'd get 2 million

1544
01:23:06,911 --> 01:23:10,840
viewers
completely over the top.

1545
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,810
Have you ever pitched something
just to fuck with somebody? No.

1546
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,410
Have you waste time if you do sometimes.

1547
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:21,290
Yeah. Like that. Yeah. I
mean because this is not,

1548
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:25,670
at first this was, I took, I mean like
I, I make my money helping people, right.

1549
01:23:25,671 --> 01:23:27,620
And I make my real money
is made on speeches.

1550
01:23:27,621 --> 01:23:29,920
Like I go to do motivational
speeches at colleges,

1551
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:33,090
teaching kids to get their shit
together and stop being busy.

1552
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,150
It's up to stop being a
whiny little bitch speech.

1553
01:23:35,151 --> 01:23:36,560
It's just this entitlement by college.

1554
01:23:36,561 --> 01:23:38,960
Kids in college is really
like me coming and I do,

1555
01:23:38,961 --> 01:23:42,230
but an hour speech and then a half hour
Q and a and I'll do a live podcast.

1556
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:46,220
It's great. I made it for
me. That's amazing money. It
changes our family's life.

1557
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:50,240
Right. So now it's like if I can do
TV, great. If I don't that's fine too.

1558
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:52,860
I'd like to do it.
But like I'll have an idea.

1559
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:54,920
I mean I had an idea of hoarder road trip.

1560
01:23:54,921 --> 01:23:57,320
I just wanted to take a bunch of
hoarders and I went to Vega taking cross

1561
01:23:57,321 --> 01:23:58,910
country. You make them clean
up someone else's house.

1562
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:03,310
Oh that's a good idea. I think it'd
be fascinating. Cross country. Right?

1563
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,740
At first it was a joke but then the
more I started pitching and I was like,

1564
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:07,330
actually I like to actually take this

1565
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:08,160
Tom.

1566
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:11,190
I was just trying to piss
off the executive cause he
had sat on my pilot for a

1567
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:14,570
year and so I was just mad at
him. He sat on the pilot. I did.

1568
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:18,030
I've done two pilots and I didn't realize
this is, everyone's done 10 pilots.

1569
01:24:18,031 --> 01:24:20,430
It is what it is.
Don't worry about it.

1570
01:24:20,431 --> 01:24:24,450
I was devastated because my first
pilot didn't make show. Really? Yeah.

1571
01:24:24,451 --> 01:24:28,320
It was devastated. Devastated. I was
like, this is going to mean I really,

1572
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:31,500
I put all my eggs in that basket and
I was just emotionally and I was like,

1573
01:24:31,501 --> 01:24:34,830
this is so important that I get this
show and by the time the network and the

1574
01:24:34,831 --> 01:24:36,420
production company and our,
they got done with it.

1575
01:24:36,421 --> 01:24:38,280
It was a shitty show and
I didn't want to do it.

1576
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,980
And I was like praying that
it wouldn't get to pick it up.

1577
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,730
But then when it didn't get picked up,
I got all upset and I got,

1578
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:45,910
I got personal with it and I just,
I've learned now

1579
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,700
is what it is. It's just business. It's,

1580
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:52,600
it's really hard to be on a show and watch
it fall apart because too many people

1581
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:56,390
have their input and they just fuck with
that. I had no input. Yeah. You know,

1582
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:00,140
and it was like, my name's
on this, my company's name
is on it. And it doesn't it,

1583
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:00,941
I mean,
well,

1584
01:25:00,941 --> 01:25:04,690
executive always think they always think
that they have a way to tweak it and to

1585
01:25:04,691 --> 01:25:08,290
make it better. Not Make It. Yeah. I'm
not saying I'm brilliant or anything.

1586
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:11,080
I was just, I was personally
upset. I think that, you know,

1587
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,870
the collaborative effort,
like a real true creative,

1588
01:25:13,871 --> 01:25:17,170
collaborative effort only works with
people who respect each other creatively.

1589
01:25:17,171 --> 01:25:20,260
Like people actually are proven to be
creative to in order to bring someone like

1590
01:25:20,261 --> 01:25:22,000
an executive into a creative meeting.

1591
01:25:22,001 --> 01:25:25,060
Like what are you a creative person
and you do write a lot. I mean,

1592
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,740
you're going to have good ideas or is
this like an eagle bullshit thing here and

1593
01:25:28,741 --> 01:25:29,310
a lot,
what was it?

1594
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:32,830
Your greasy fingerprints on this and
you're a little ingredients to the soup.

1595
01:25:32,831 --> 01:25:36,940
That's what a lot of it is. I mean, I'm
bad with hoarders. There's no writing.

1596
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:40,750
We turn the cameras on and shit
happens. Yeah. And that's it.

1597
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:44,710
It's pretty easy your show. No, I
don't, I'm, I'm just the talent on that.

1598
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:48,100
How many different dudes are
Horter cleaners? We've got, well,

1599
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:52,600
there's two really loud, I mean there's
a lot of people that that try to do it,

1600
01:25:52,601 --> 01:25:56,250
but it's like a hit show right now.
I'm still really well, you know,

1601
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:59,710
I say I'm the number one trash man in the
country and he has no problem with you

1602
01:25:59,711 --> 01:26:03,380
doing all your other stuff or they just
don't know. I don't even on a contract,

1603
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,570
you're not on a contract and week to week.

1604
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:08,360
Whoa, that's crazy. That's got to be
annoying. And the number one guy on,

1605
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:11,090
you know their number two
show. It amazes me. I'm fine.

1606
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:13,280
I don't want a contract now
like it doesn't contract.

1607
01:26:13,281 --> 01:26:16,580
I couldn't come do this like I'm you said
it best the other day on your podcasts

1608
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:18,470
you go,
I'm doing what I should be doing.

1609
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:23,540
You're doing it right now and I'm there
man. My Pi Kat, I'm doing, I wrote a book,

1610
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:26,360
had a great run with my book. I'm
helping a lot of families with my book.

1611
01:26:26,361 --> 01:26:27,590
It's called secret lives of hoarders,

1612
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:31,220
so you're just happy to keep moving
the right direction and keep working.

1613
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:35,930
I clean up shit for 12 bucks an hour.
I'm happy to be working, period.

1614
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:37,910
Like I'm lucky to have work.

1615
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:42,140
I can afford all my groceries and
my mortgage in the same month.

1616
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:47,020
I'm lucky. Like that's awesome. So
I'm not, I'm not, I hope I, if I ever,

1617
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:49,320
I would say if I ever get
pretentious or think I'm, um,

1618
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:50,960
fancy and he kicked me in the nuts,

1619
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:57,320
a job that must keep you grounded
in zillion possibilities of reality,

1620
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:01,020
not necessarily your reality, but the
pony was every in this, that's the,

1621
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,370
that's what we hang with five
decisions away because, uh,

1622
01:27:04,371 --> 01:27:07,220
back to winning and finished it,
that bum sitting in the yard,

1623
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:10,880
I asked him how he got there and he goes,
oh, I was a stockbroker. And I was like,

1624
01:27:10,881 --> 01:27:14,180
get outta here. Whoa. And I'm like, he's
there, he's full of shit or this is real.

1625
01:27:14,181 --> 01:27:16,910
So I went with it, you know, and I was
like, what do you mean you were striking?

1626
01:27:16,911 --> 01:27:19,730
He goes, I was a stockbroker and a
girl broke my heart. And they go,

1627
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:22,760
you're telling me you're living in this
guy's yard because a girl broke your

1628
01:27:22,761 --> 01:27:25,160
heart. He was willing to go
to addicted to crack too.

1629
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:28,820
But the girl broke my
heart and I was like, yeah,

1630
01:27:28,821 --> 01:27:32,270
the crack plan of something to do with
it. Yeah. But he lived in a fucking shack.

1631
01:27:32,271 --> 01:27:33,710
And so I looked at the camera and I go,

1632
01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:37,260
I guess we are all released five decisions
away from shitting in a bucket. Yeah.

1633
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,020
Wow. And, and that just stuck.

1634
01:27:39,021 --> 01:27:42,890
And when I said that people ran with
it and I'm clearly five had many five

1635
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:45,770
decisions away from shitting in a
bucket and mean couple things different

1636
01:27:45,771 --> 01:27:47,330
happened.
And I in my life could have been told

1637
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:51,050
it might not be any five,
it can be one if it's a bad one,

1638
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:56,370
peed in mountain dew cans.
So I car skip the eggs.

1639
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:59,810
I missed once and I was trying
to get my dick into the whole.

1640
01:27:59,811 --> 01:28:03,830
But of course I have a very fat head,
very dominate your whole is huge.

1641
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:06,550
And the amount of the whole of
it wasn't a mountain do actually.

1642
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,550
It was a Pepsi bottle.

1643
01:28:07,551 --> 01:28:11,390
And I was trying to try to get it in
there and I fucking spray cause I was kind

1644
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:14,360
of holding it back and then I
sprayed it all over my fucking pants.

1645
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:18,680
I pissed all over my leg dude before
I finally got it going in the bottle.

1646
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:20,390
So this is only a year ago by the way.

1647
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:25,970
I shit myself the first year
driving. No, it was a year ago.

1648
01:28:25,971 --> 01:28:27,650
I didn't tell you about this.
I fucking shit myself.

1649
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:32,410
The other day I did one of those parts
where I'm working and it just went like

1650
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,850
that and I thought it felt like a fart.

1651
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:38,810
And then I reached down and just to like
itch my ass and it was really wet and

1652
01:28:38,811 --> 01:28:42,700
creamy and I pull it out, baby diaper
shit all over my pants. I'm like,

1653
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:45,760
wait a minute,
you must falling down to claw at your ass.

1654
01:28:45,761 --> 01:28:49,100
Like I went to itch my asshole
asshole

1655
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:53,890
asshole on a regular basis and then
just go around and touch through,

1656
01:28:53,891 --> 01:28:57,670
smell out of your mouth.
So it's never itch from the inside.

1657
01:28:59,010 --> 01:29:02,130
I never touched your fucking
door again. No, no, no.

1658
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:05,320
I'm not talking like I went to like
deep in my asshole like I was talking to

1659
01:29:05,321 --> 01:29:09,150
like right above my ass. It's creamy
shit. All creepy shit everywhere.

1660
01:29:09,230 --> 01:29:11,760
I don't believe you just dabble
over the top. I think he goes by.

1661
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:14,150
No I don't. Why would I do
that? That's disgusting.

1662
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:18,530
But it was so bad and I didn't
even know. Wow. You gotta Numb Ass.

1663
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,060
You've got a problem. Do you think it's
mostly getting raped by ghosts? No.

1664
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:23,660
But do you think when this shit happens,
do you,

1665
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:26,840
do you think it's because like you're
trying to force a fart out so bad.

1666
01:29:26,841 --> 01:29:28,850
He's like,
if I just don't,

1667
01:29:28,851 --> 01:29:32,270
I try to force Fartah I tried to
make them loud as possible and fast.

1668
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:34,820
Oh awesome.
I had a thing about this.

1669
01:29:34,821 --> 01:29:39,650
I always say like when mode nine out of
10 times your asshole, it has your back,

1670
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:42,500
right? He'll back you up. They
didn't say no, it's a fart.

1671
01:29:42,501 --> 01:29:45,710
You know the last second that shit and
it catches it. Right. And I was like,

1672
01:29:45,711 --> 01:29:48,830
I wish your asshole would do that. Like
in other parts of your life. Right.

1673
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:52,360
You know, like when you're going to fuck
the fat girl at three o'clock, right?

1674
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:54,860
You're assholes. Like, Hey,
hang on a second buddy. Wait,

1675
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,190
your asshole kid,
hold back the liquid.

1676
01:29:57,191 --> 01:30:00,520
That's what I find when it's liquid and
you feel that, oh, it's coming too fast.

1677
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:05,390
You know your asshole sends alarms
up. Yeah. This was liquid. This, yeah.

1678
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:08,270
Yeah.
It's your diet probably,

1679
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:11,010
but it's, that's the first time in
three years maybe that's happened

1680
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:13,430
since I've been drinking these
Kale shakes on a regular basis.

1681
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:14,960
It never had kale shakes.

1682
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:18,440
You know what the hell by itself
will fuck it and just destroy you.

1683
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:22,130
It's really good for you. Oh, I
know. Yeah. Um, there's a Vitamix.

1684
01:30:22,131 --> 01:30:26,460
I throw two cumbers Kale, celery, um, uh,

1685
01:30:26,461 --> 01:30:30,740
one pair, a big chunk of ginger
and four or five cloves of garlic.

1686
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:32,061
I mean,

1687
01:30:32,061 --> 01:30:35,490
you're going to lose five pounds a day
of shit to clean up stomach weight,

1688
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:39,740
but you feel great. You do? Yeah.
Oh Man. This feels like I'm saying,

1689
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:41,870
I've been talking to him and tell about
it helped me out with shakes and stuff

1690
01:30:41,871 --> 01:30:44,990
to try and get healthy. I'm talking
about Kevin James turned me onto it.

1691
01:30:44,991 --> 01:30:48,950
He lost 80 pounds and uh,
he was explaining to me in
his book that he bought a,

1692
01:30:48,951 --> 01:30:52,100
he had this lady working form
as a chef for a while and uh,

1693
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,320
the idea was it was the,

1694
01:30:53,330 --> 01:30:58,330
there's like really nutrient rich plant
based foods blended up together that

1695
01:30:58,671 --> 01:31:01,220
would be like your first meal
a day and just doing that,

1696
01:31:01,221 --> 01:31:03,140
it keeps like your digestive track,

1697
01:31:03,141 --> 01:31:04,790
like really sweet because
it essentially like,

1698
01:31:04,970 --> 01:31:08,390
it's like it's a flush out and like cleans
out already is a very important thing.

1699
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,700
I don't realize. Yeah.
Well yeah, I mean it's,

1700
01:31:10,701 --> 01:31:14,840
you're not supposed to be keeping shit
inside your body. You know, you can,

1701
01:31:14,841 --> 01:31:15,830
if you have a bad diet,

1702
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:16,540
I,

1703
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:21,540
my job probably half of my job is looking
at what comes out of a person that

1704
01:31:22,661 --> 01:31:24,910
doesn't eat healthfully.
That's a fetish of yourself.

1705
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,620
I think I'm starting to
think part of my life.

1706
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:28,720
I think it's just what it
is is a part of my life man.

1707
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:32,050
And there's in your ass well separate.
I just liked it.

1708
01:31:32,051 --> 01:31:36,700
I just like a finger in my ass that has
nothing to do with porn. No. I like,

1709
01:31:36,701 --> 01:31:38,740
um,
I probably shouldn't go into that.

1710
01:31:39,130 --> 01:31:39,963
Okay.

1711
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:46,040
I'm with you. I don't, I don't
and they don't like it. Andy.

1712
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,670
I don't like a skinny girl.
I liked them.

1713
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:51,630
Wait, I'm the girl. That's all I'm saying.
The fatter ones are loosely more fun.

1714
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,660
It's stream, mate. That's what I do.

1715
01:31:53,661 --> 01:31:56,810
Bbws you just go through the
top 10 and it's beautiful.

1716
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,130
10 pounds heavy is way better than
10 pounds to light. Well, I'm talking

1717
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:03,850
about, I'm talking about it. Oh yeah.
But I agree with that. What does BBW big,

1718
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:07,180
beautiful women. Oh, cheers. Cheers.

1719
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:15,250
Yeah. Women don't understand that little
fat as sexy. It doesn't bother me at all.

1720
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:15,880
You know,

1721
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:20,100
as long as you know the unhealthy little
oils don't look that good naked. No, no.

1722
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:23,200
They don't want and it looks beautiful.
It's more skin to play with.

1723
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:23,980
It feels like you're on a,

1724
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:27,190
would you rather have a king
size pool or a little baby pool?

1725
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:30,070
This is a horrible topic,
but to bring it up. No,

1726
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:34,060
you're just talking to Brian and that's
what brought my a great topic. My, my,

1727
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:36,490
my wife and I had, uh, my wife's
really big into natural birth.

1728
01:32:36,491 --> 01:32:40,060
We had a natural birth funny guys.
Yeah. We know what it was awesome.

1729
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:43,510
And most people do. It's fine. We
actually had it in our bedroom at home.

1730
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:46,630
It was amazing. Um, most
people think it's crazy.

1731
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:49,720
My wife like that was her iron man.
Like she really wanted that.

1732
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:53,420
She did it yesterday and it was
really cool and I, and I dug it. Wow.

1733
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:58,570
The subsequent argument was do
you circumcise a kid or not?

1734
01:32:58,571 --> 01:33:01,900
Because all of her natural war and it's
really hippie world and I'm not into the

1735
01:33:01,901 --> 01:33:04,420
whole hippiness of the world.
I enjoyed the process of natural birth,

1736
01:33:04,421 --> 01:33:06,490
but I'm not into the whole hippie
lifestyle part of it. Right.

1737
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:09,310
And all of her friends, they didn't
circumstance or kids and I was like,

1738
01:33:09,311 --> 01:33:14,080
I'm not about to send my kid
to gym class in a very, uh,

1739
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,680
a world where everyone gets
circumcised to pink song. Yeah.

1740
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,630
I think that's changing.
It used to be apparently is 50 50 now.

1741
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:23,670
I wouldn't circumcise a kid if I had a
boy. Wouldn't circle. Well apparently,

1742
01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:25,920
but the point that conversation was we,

1743
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:29,520
the girls are all the wives start arguing.
We start talking three of the wall.

1744
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:34,620
I was guaranteed they were like sex
with a dude that is not circumcised is

1745
01:33:34,621 --> 01:33:39,220
substantially better than a dude that is,
and then all these girls were like, oh,

1746
01:33:39,221 --> 01:33:42,100
that's true. That's true. That's
why I don't know. More scan.

1747
01:33:42,101 --> 01:33:43,090
Apparently back to the,

1748
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:47,800
just like we talked about the ladies
and they all were like absolutely.

1749
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:50,650
Like it wasn't like they were
being nice for the woman. Wow.

1750
01:33:50,651 --> 01:33:54,520
I've never even heard that before I
buy it. I was like, wow, I got robbed.

1751
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:56,470
Even with licensed,

1752
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:59,030
even if I wasn't serving size I don't
think would make a difference me,

1753
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:03,450
but I think it's a fucking
gross tradition, man.
Somebody said the cure, it's,

1754
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:07,320
it helps prevent aids. I'm like, well
you keep an aids and you're forced skin.

1755
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:09,060
Like what's going on? How has that, I know

1756
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:14,470
that seems to me the exposure to aids
and lack of exposure is how you prevent

1757
01:34:14,471 --> 01:34:14,711
aids.

1758
01:34:14,711 --> 01:34:19,711
Not like for skin chopping off
purely cosmetic for us and I,

1759
01:34:19,721 --> 01:34:21,760
but I enforced, I was like,
we're absolutely doing it.

1760
01:34:21,761 --> 01:34:24,840
We're not going to have one kid that
is and when candidate isn't consistent,

1761
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:28,790
Jesus Christ. I mean, why does, my brother
looked different than me. You know,

1762
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:33,640
I like to fuck Jewish weddings, so I'm
definitely, yeah, circumcised. Yeah. Yeah.

1763
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:37,720
All right. Whatever you like freak
Jewish women. I think it's just session.

1764
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:42,040
So weird fucking tradition that we need
to end your cutting and not only that,

1765
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:45,940
but people get like really bad infections.
It's not,

1766
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:49,360
it's not completely innocuous.
Kids have lost their penises because of,

1767
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:51,100
because of circumcisions.
It's not,

1768
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:54,040
my nephew had to go back for a
second and operation because of that.

1769
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:58,220
I don't put them under the age of
a year or something. Oh my God.

1770
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:03,290
Oh my God. Yeah. Mad for
what? To dress up. Nice.

1771
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,590
We should start some kind of tick.
It's not a jack-o-lantern. Right.

1772
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:10,460
He'd have to chop parts off of it to
make it look better. That's stupid.

1773
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:13,770
Save the peanuts,
peanuts in a jar and where it has a neck,

1774
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:17,780
what kind of tests have actually been
done that show that there's some sort of a

1775
01:35:17,781 --> 01:35:20,840
health benefit to circumcision there?
There've been any, there has to be

1776
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:26,770
a Christian school.
Probably did the research really.

1777
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:32,930
I'm sure it's, I'm sure it's a metal.
There's a, I mean it costs four grand.

1778
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:34,850
I'll tell you that.
That's how much you gonna pay.

1779
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:38,390
You didn't have like an old Jewish dude
suck the blood off of it afterwards too.

1780
01:35:38,391 --> 01:35:41,060
John have a breast now.
Isn't that amazing that,

1781
01:35:41,061 --> 01:35:43,490
that they actually still do
it that way some places. Yeah.

1782
01:35:43,491 --> 01:35:47,900
A guy will suck the blood off and you
know, and he was explaining it on,

1783
01:35:47,901 --> 01:35:52,520
on a youtube video and it was
like a serious, you know, um, uh,

1784
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:53,410
you know,

1785
01:35:53,410 --> 01:35:57,890
what does the Word Orthodox Jew and he
was saying that it's an ancient tradition

1786
01:35:57,891 --> 01:36:01,610
because of the blood. Uh, actually, uh,
coagulates better because of the saliva.

1787
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:06,470
It stops the bleeding quicker. I
just spit on that penis ever. Man.

1788
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:12,020
That's where I go back to. Wouldn't have
that on my kid. But if that's your thing,

1789
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:15,320
that's your thing, I support
you. Right. Decrease in fit.

1790
01:36:15,321 --> 01:36:16,250
Here's one of the problems.

1791
01:36:16,251 --> 01:36:21,070
One of the benefits decrease in physical
problems involving a tight foreskin. Uh,

1792
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:25,520
yeah. That means because you got no
force, can you fuck, that's the dumbest.

1793
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:26,940
That's the dumbest benefit I've ever had.

1794
01:36:26,941 --> 01:36:28,970
And that's the red rather
than that's the first benefit.

1795
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:33,350
They listed benefits increasing physical
problems involving a tight for skin.

1796
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:36,490
Well you knew a lot of kids are running
around complaining about tight forced

1797
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:39,680
cans. Isn't it more susceptible
to disease because there's,

1798
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,160
it's like you're having that extra belly
button on your Dick it, well, I would,

1799
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:47,000
yeah, I dunno. I mean shit, it's got
to get dirty or you mean when it's,

1800
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:52,840
when there is, there is tickling. I've
been told what's it taste like? Well,

1801
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:56,630
I think it's also like moist. I think that
to the head of the penis, I don't need,

1802
01:36:56,631 --> 01:36:58,580
the four skin is moist
and much more sensitive.

1803
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:01,580
When you circumcised that it dries out.
It's like half numb.

1804
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:03,330
It's gotta be moldy every time.

1805
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:06,980
And lower incidents of the inflammation
of the head of the penis, whatever,

1806
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,550
urinate, reduced urinary tract infections
because it kind of makes sense. Clean.

1807
01:37:10,551 --> 01:37:13,820
You're dirty Dick. I can fix all
that. Fewer problems with erections,

1808
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:17,540
especially at puberty. Why is there a
problem with an erection? Why? Yeah,

1809
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:20,440
that doesn't mean never been a problem
in my life. If you were problems,

1810
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:23,450
it looks creepy. What does that mean
by problems? You know what that means?

1811
01:37:23,451 --> 01:37:26,660
That means he's getting erections all
the time because I've heard that happens

1812
01:37:26,661 --> 01:37:29,360
to people that are circumcised.
Like when you pull the skin back,

1813
01:37:29,361 --> 01:37:31,970
like they get excited like really easily.
Apparently it doesn't have,

1814
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,250
it's much more sensitive and if
the wind blows, that's funny.

1815
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:38,510
That's a listed as a benefit.
Fewer problems with erections,

1816
01:37:38,511 --> 01:37:40,880
especially at puberty. When you
write, especially a puberty,

1817
01:37:40,881 --> 01:37:44,750
I'm assuming you don't want kids to
fuck at 13 so I'm thinking you're saying

1818
01:37:44,751 --> 01:37:48,750
these are unwanted directions, so some
old, some old woman or old dude, right,

1819
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:52,730
but so they're saying we've made your
penis feel less good so you don't have as

1820
01:37:52,731 --> 01:37:55,500
many problems with it. Feeling good. Back
to my point of these women were saying,

1821
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:56,670
apparently it feels better,

1822
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:02,000
decrease in certain sexual transmitted
sexually transmitted diseases such as

1823
01:38:02,401 --> 01:38:04,380
HIV, HPV, genital herpes,

1824
01:38:04,381 --> 01:38:08,490
syphilis and other microorganisms in
men and their partners. A decrease. Hmm.

1825
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:14,070
Okay. Well, I don't know. Yeah. Why
is that? Does that resemble more skin?

1826
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:18,540
How do you know there's more, there's
more shit holes and peace books on. Yeah.

1827
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:23,430
Well almost complete elimination
of invasive penile cancer. Oh,

1828
01:38:23,431 --> 01:38:27,540
that's a good reason. Invasive
penile cancer. What's that
internal it sounds like.

1829
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:30,510
No, no, no invasive.
I think it's just bad.

1830
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:35,150
Decreasing your lung cancer would be
bad. Yeah, I would imagine peanut. Okay.

1831
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:39,360
Have you, have you got the f like 40 year
old thing, a tube in the penis hole yet?

1832
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:42,810
Like I, my dad told me and when he
turned 45 or something like that,

1833
01:38:42,811 --> 01:38:46,090
he had to get this done early. Your
Dick like crawls back. I get it.

1834
01:38:46,150 --> 01:38:48,750
It runs away from the tube and
they're trying to get it in.

1835
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:53,730
My buddy was telling me that. They said
basically, and I, a lot of my buddies,

1836
01:38:53,731 --> 01:38:57,510
a lot of my buddies and I, we all did
a bunch of iron mans and triathlons,

1837
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,120
draft lines and the worst,
like an iron man Dick.

1838
01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:02,970
Like it takes two days for your Dick to
come back out of your stomach after an

1839
01:39:02,971 --> 01:39:05,810
hour and like you'll never see it because
you're on a bike running and something

1840
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:09,240
for like 10, 12 hours and you'd
literally like the after the iron man,

1841
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:12,150
you're up against the wall and you're
just paying out of your stomach.

1842
01:39:12,151 --> 01:39:16,900
Like it takes a good two days if you're
addicted, come back. Oh Wow. It's a great,

1843
01:39:16,930 --> 01:39:20,430
it's an honor. I mean, I never did a full,
is that like really bad for your balls?

1844
01:39:20,431 --> 01:39:24,600
All that pressure. I've heard guys get
like numbness gets really bad blisters.

1845
01:39:24,601 --> 01:39:28,000
You got to uh, use cow like cal letter,
what they put on a cow's letters.

1846
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:31,280
It's like a sad that you
put on your balls, you know,

1847
01:39:31,290 --> 01:39:35,430
get rid of that ball so you don't get
any, get really bad blisters. Yeah. Jesus.

1848
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:37,140
Hey Brian,
pull up a youtube video.

1849
01:39:37,141 --> 01:39:40,920
Rabbi explains the process
of sucking blood from penis.

1850
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:46,760
That's it's on youtube. It's a bit
aggressive, I think. Yeah. What the fuck?

1851
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:51,110
This is from 2011 too.
What's it called?

1852
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:54,950
Rabbi explains the
process of sucking blood.

1853
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:59,300
Just look for that on youtube and you'll
find that from penis if you want to put

1854
01:39:59,301 --> 01:40:00,134
from the penis.

1855
01:40:03,770 --> 01:40:08,330
That's the guy. Yeah. You got to
take a leak. Yeah, go ahead. Yes.

1856
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,193
Perfect.

1857
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:17,630
Four sections of, hello.
How cold the shore.

1858
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:21,490
The set table in chapter

1859
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:27,850
two 66 uh, I loved the
three, four, five and six.

1860
01:40:27,851 --> 01:40:32,110
He describes how the circumcision is
to be done. This is after the cutting.

1861
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:37,770
The bone does what's called it seeps in
but seats and means to suck and it means

1862
01:40:38,591 --> 01:40:42,730
doing so with his mouth. I want to
say, well, why can't you use it too?

1863
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:47,580
Why don't you could technically,
but it's not the customer as to why,

1864
01:40:47,590 --> 01:40:51,160
how it was done. Now why is it that
way? I won't say the olden days.

1865
01:40:51,161 --> 01:40:53,920
You didn't have to. Now
you can have. So why not?

1866
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:59,610
The answers I thought about it is that
it's not as effective because the tube

1867
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:02,560
does not seal as well.

1868
01:41:02,561 --> 01:41:06,790
It's not as pliable and furthermore,

1869
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:11,020
it's not as quick and it's not as close.

1870
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:16,690
You have to have a quick suction action.
You have to have more pliability. No.

1871
01:41:16,691 --> 01:41:20,800
So there's the theory.
Some people feel that it is,

1872
01:41:20,801 --> 01:41:25,210
some people feel that it's not that
the saliva of a human being has some

1873
01:41:25,211 --> 01:41:30,211
antiseptic qualities and it's actually
brought in the Hallock of the film that

1874
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:31,900
uh,

1875
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:36,900
the saliva of certain people were actually
use this curatives and so saliva is

1876
01:41:39,011 --> 01:41:43,810
not a bad thing. Saliva has
elements of shut this crazy ass off.

1877
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:48,480
Oh Jesus Christ. This is one of the
things that's really wrong with religion.

1878
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:52,620
When religion, when they
get into tradition and they
just explain what it is,

1879
01:41:52,621 --> 01:41:57,360
the tradition you're talking
about blowing a baby period,

1880
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:58,530
that's what you're talking about.

1881
01:41:58,531 --> 01:42:03,531
If there's anything in your religion
that justifies blowing a baby,

1882
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:08,840
your fucking crazy and sucking blood
off a baby's deck after you've cut it.

1883
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:10,760
Yeah.

1884
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:14,960
Only thing I could think of as like did
the other side of this is that, I mean,

1885
01:42:14,961 --> 01:42:16,760
my sister took,
uh,

1886
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:21,340
my nephew to a doctor high in hospital,
knee.

1887
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:26,360
These are doctors going to
college and they fucked it
up. How many? Like, how bad,

1888
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:27,450
how many times did it,
these guys,

1889
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:30,080
did they give you fuck it up too. In
fact, one of the guys do it a lot.

1890
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:31,980
Someone's killed a baby recently

1891
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:38,280
in the New York hospital after
contracting herpes from a controversial

1892
01:42:38,281 --> 01:42:39,900
circumcision ritual. Uh, the,

1893
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:43,220
the [inaudible] or whatever the fuck he
calls himself, the, the rabbi, whoever it,

1894
01:42:43,230 --> 01:42:48,030
who does that suck the baby's Dick
after he did the circumcision and he had

1895
01:42:48,031 --> 01:42:51,630
herpes in his mouth and he,
he gave it to the baby and the baby died.

1896
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,620
That's crazy. Well, you can,
this is from 2012. This is march.

1897
01:42:56,270 --> 01:43:01,020
This is not 88. This is March six, 2012.
It's in the Huffington Post. You can,

1898
01:43:01,021 --> 01:43:03,990
you can read this. And by the way, this
is not the first time this has happened.

1899
01:43:03,991 --> 01:43:07,260
This has happened many times in
the past. I've heard about it. Uh,

1900
01:43:07,261 --> 01:43:11,690
another one in 2005, there was, it says
it right here. Another one in 2005, 2004.

1901
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:15,000
You look, there's, there's,
it's, it's disgusting. If you,

1902
01:43:15,001 --> 01:43:18,000
religion is allowing you to blow babies,
cut their dicks and then sock them,

1903
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:21,630
that's not good. Period. I don't
give a fuck if it's in the tradition.

1904
01:43:21,690 --> 01:43:25,410
And what would you do with a d? Shut
your mouth. You're stupid tradition.

1905
01:43:25,411 --> 01:43:29,850
He crazy asshole. Just because something's
old doesn't mean it's good. And that's,

1906
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:34,350
that's just the following, that
tradition. That is the best argument.

1907
01:43:34,351 --> 01:43:37,680
One of the best arguments next to like
suicide bombers and one of the best

1908
01:43:37,681 --> 01:43:40,380
arguments ever for your
religion being fucking crazy.

1909
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:43,950
It's tradition is never a good argument
here, right? Yeah. Why do we do it?

1910
01:43:43,951 --> 01:43:47,640
It's the tradition. You know, I grew
up in Virginia, antiseptic properties,

1911
01:43:47,670 --> 01:43:49,240
you know,
what else has on a septic property.

1912
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:52,520
A lot of things that if tradition in
Virginia are now missing the whole thing

1913
01:43:52,521 --> 01:43:54,180
while you went to the bathroom,
this guy,

1914
01:43:54,181 --> 01:43:58,100
he's this old rabbi talking about
blowing kids after he circumstances.

1915
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:01,910
And that's why I missed it. Yeah. Thank
you. And he's talking about why, you know,

1916
01:44:01,911 --> 01:44:05,000
why don't we use the tube? Well, because
first of all, it's to a tradition,

1917
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:09,590
it's tradition. Coming to my website and
have a gold show. It's the tradition.

1918
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:13,280
What you crazy asshole and
saliva has antiseptic properties.

1919
01:44:13,281 --> 01:44:17,330
You know what else has
antiseptic properties ready
and aseptic you fucking cunt.

1920
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:18,770
Crazy asshole.

1921
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:21,730
It's actually a very good cleaner except
when you get herpes in their mouth and

1922
01:44:21,731 --> 01:44:26,600
then kill the baby,
nutty ass rabbi Jesus Christ.

1923
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:30,140
So now what is the single,

1924
01:44:30,141 --> 01:44:33,530
you've seen pretty much everything a
person could possibly see inside these

1925
01:44:33,531 --> 01:44:37,550
houses, but there must be one day where
you showed up at work and you went,

1926
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:41,410
this shit just got taken to the
next level. Everything accelerates.

1927
01:44:41,790 --> 01:44:44,620
It's a tie. Yes, there was,

1928
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:49,310
I saw a cat actually pull
itself out of a pile of shit.

1929
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:51,270
Human Shit. It like, you know,

1930
01:44:51,271 --> 01:44:52,590
like when you're trying to
get out of the pool and you,

1931
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:56,040
this cat was pulling itself
out of a pile of shit.

1932
01:44:56,250 --> 01:45:00,810
I just thought that was awesome. Like it
wasn't gross. It was just, it was intense.

1933
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:03,140
Um, the worst ever was, uh,

1934
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:08,100
I had a cat and there's a house and a
lot of cats for people that are listening

1935
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:10,910
and actually know the show. Hoarders,
her name was viola. She's a cool lady. I,

1936
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:15,420
she'd become a good friend fight three
years later, but at the time she was,

1937
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:19,470
she cured. Now she's dealing with
it. I don't think you're ever cured.

1938
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,640
I'm just like with my game on,
I'm always going to have any edge.

1939
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:24,330
Every once in a while she's like lived.
She lives in a clean house.

1940
01:45:24,331 --> 01:45:27,240
She cleaned her, we cleaned her house.
She stayed committed. She did the therapy,

1941
01:45:27,241 --> 01:45:29,000
her key,
her family stays with or something.

1942
01:45:29,190 --> 01:45:31,110
One of the key components
to recovery is it,

1943
01:45:31,111 --> 01:45:34,080
your family is very committed to
the recovery as well. So like her,

1944
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:36,990
her kids keep her busy. Like she can't
go to goodwill if she goes to goodwill,

1945
01:45:36,991 --> 01:45:40,020
she'll spend, she's just like, need
a gamble at a, at a blackjack table.

1946
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,550
She goes to goodwill.
She'll go crazy.

1947
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:44,270
Have you heard of Ibogaine?
Hmm? What is that?

1948
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:49,100
We had this guy in yesterday who had just
got back from an Ibogaine ceremony in

1949
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:51,910
Costa Rica.
And what I began,

1950
01:45:51,911 --> 01:45:56,200
this is this crazy psychedelic drug that
makes you look at your, yourself from a,

1951
01:45:56,210 --> 01:45:57,860
a very,
uh,

1952
01:45:58,930 --> 01:46:03,110
what's the best way to look at
it out like a very critical,

1953
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:04,400
highly critical,

1954
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:09,160
honest view of your life from outside
of your emotions and your ego in there.

1955
01:46:09,170 --> 01:46:12,860
And it's apparently this very
informative psychedelic experience.

1956
01:46:12,861 --> 01:46:16,430
You can actually ask it questions.
The whole experience takes like 24 hours,

1957
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:21,470
but it has a really high success rate
and curing people with all sorts of

1958
01:46:21,471 --> 01:46:25,400
diseases, especially, um, uh,
addictions, gambling, addictions,

1959
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:28,660
drug addictions,
people that are hooked on opiates have a

1960
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:31,900
rate of success. That's a different level.
I mean, I was, I don't want to ever,

1961
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:33,910
I don't ever want to act
like I'm this bad ass,

1962
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:37,190
but I'm saying in this massive
thing, for sure it did. Dude.

1963
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:39,060
You just did it with your
will and your personality.

1964
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:41,790
That's not what I, that's what I'm
saying. What I'm saying is have you, oh,

1965
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:45,360
I wonder, like a really good
show would be combining. Yeah,

1966
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:49,230
we're open to anything, man. Yeah. This is
the cool thing is this is a new disease.

1967
01:46:49,530 --> 01:46:52,710
It's not like alcoholism where
there's this like set specific way.

1968
01:46:52,711 --> 01:46:55,610
This is what you must do to overcome it.
How long has it been around for a while?

1969
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:57,510
It's been around since,
I mean hunter and gathering.

1970
01:46:57,511 --> 01:47:01,350
I mean it's been around since the day one,
but it's just,

1971
01:47:01,351 --> 01:47:04,740
I mean our show just blew the doors off
it and people are just accepting the

1972
01:47:04,741 --> 01:47:08,220
fact that their aunt Gladys is actually
a hoarder. She's not just crazy.

1973
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,190
Like we're just really still, I
mean it's actually just getting, uh,

1974
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:14,760
it's now just getting classified May.
This was my second horde.

1975
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:18,060
This was a great guy. I got, I got
sprayed by a skunk in this house.

1976
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:22,490
I thought it was a cat and I went to pick
it up and it was a skunk in the garage

1977
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:23,430
in the garage.

1978
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:27,240
They were like a hundred cats and I just
stopped counting and then I get hit by,

1979
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:30,440
I got hit by a skunk. Oh my
God. That was a crazy one.

1980
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:34,110
We have a friend that has 11 cats
in one house, two bedroom apartment.

1981
01:47:34,111 --> 01:47:38,280
You think that's normal? Here's my deal
on cats. You need to have as many cats.

1982
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:40,170
You can't have any more
cats than you have friends.

1983
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:43,410
If you have more cats and have friends,
we've got an issue.

1984
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:48,420
He has a lot of friends, then he's fine,
but okay, in a two bedroom apartment, I,

1985
01:47:48,430 --> 01:47:51,470
to me, that's a bit much honestly, but
if he's cool with it, he's cool. I mean,

1986
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:53,170
if it doesn't mess up,
if it doesn't mess up your life,

1987
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:55,560
the crossline for me is when your hoard,

1988
01:47:55,561 --> 01:47:58,380
whenever that hoard is whatever
you're collecting or keeping,

1989
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:01,890
when it crosses over and it becomes more
important than your friends and your

1990
01:48:01,891 --> 01:48:05,940
family and your job, then
you got a problem. Right? It
could be. It could be. I mean,

1991
01:48:05,941 --> 01:48:10,800
I, I had a lot of friends in the iron
man world that I think they have issues,

1992
01:48:10,801 --> 01:48:13,740
man, like they're so addicted
to the race and to, to the,

1993
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:16,830
to the fitness level that it's
affecting the rest of their life.

1994
01:48:16,831 --> 01:48:19,380
They don't have normal relationships
with anyone else in their life.

1995
01:48:19,381 --> 01:48:23,190
Like they're so focused on the
trapline that I think it's too much.

1996
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:26,820
I think you could see that we need to be
successful. That's a tough one. I mean,

1997
01:48:26,821 --> 01:48:29,880
yeah, Mama Training. Those guys have
to go with you, but you don't have to.

1998
01:48:29,881 --> 01:48:31,770
When you could be like a hundredth,

1999
01:48:31,780 --> 01:48:35,250
he still finished a fucking iron man
posting like, talk cares. I'm not,

2000
01:48:35,251 --> 01:48:39,180
I don't want to win though. What if
they're close? They a lot of markets,

2001
01:48:39,210 --> 01:48:41,400
I don't give a shit about winning
and I'm going to finish her guy.

2002
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:42,121
Like I'm the guy.

2003
01:48:42,121 --> 01:48:44,500
Like I used to hate the old guys
that played golf that were like, Oh,

2004
01:48:44,501 --> 01:48:48,420
I'm just happy to be outside.
I'm totally that guy now the outside,

2005
01:48:48,421 --> 01:48:52,680
well it's a good day. I'm fine. So the
lure of success, especially success.

2006
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:57,360
Success in other parts of my life, I don't
need that success. I'm healthy. I get,

2007
01:48:57,390 --> 01:49:01,170
I mean I, I keep saying it
every day. I get, you know,

2008
01:49:01,290 --> 01:49:02,970
50 emails of people that I've helped.

2009
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:06,030
They neither seen a show or read my
book or listen to a podcast. So I,

2010
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:11,080
I start the morning by 9:00 AM I've
already tell myself I'm successful today.

2011
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:14,280
I was good and so I'm lucky like I
don't need what you've put it all,

2012
01:49:14,281 --> 01:49:16,140
you've put your obsession
into a good place.

2013
01:49:16,141 --> 01:49:17,820
I think this is a really
good lesson for people.

2014
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:21,720
My speeches is called 14 years of failure.
I failed for 14 years.

2015
01:49:21,721 --> 01:49:25,120
I'm just starting to get successful.
The also what your, your,

2016
01:49:25,220 --> 01:49:29,130
what you've done that's admirable is sort
of recognize where you were fucking up

2017
01:49:29,131 --> 01:49:31,110
and just stopped it. You know? That's,

2018
01:49:31,111 --> 01:49:32,980
that's really difficult
for a lot of people to do.

2019
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:34,170
Even wrap their head around it.

2020
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,890
Especially without going through like
some real extensive therapy and I'm old

2021
01:49:37,891 --> 01:49:41,280
school man. If you stop lying to
yourself, it gets a lot easier. Right.

2022
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:44,880
I lied to myself for a year after year
that out. Yeah. I'm telling you right now,

2023
01:49:44,881 --> 01:49:48,240
people listening to stop
lying to yourself. I'm saying,
yeah, you figured that out.

2024
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:51,550
A lot of people, a guy beating the fuck
out of you. Is that what it wakes you up?

2025
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:55,300
And then my mom saying,
no, my mom saying no was,

2026
01:49:55,360 --> 01:50:00,160
I even thought I was still
unstoppable until my mom said,

2027
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:04,990
you're on your own. You find a legal way
out of this. My mom said no. It was like,

2028
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:08,290
oh shit, it's life's
changing. I'm on my own.

2029
01:50:08,350 --> 01:50:13,140
That thrill seeking charge that you
get from placing bets, you know, it's,

2030
01:50:13,141 --> 01:50:17,260
it's really just sort of a, a desire
to be successful. You're trying to win.

2031
01:50:17,261 --> 01:50:21,040
So I think it's trying to win.
It has nothing to do with gambling.

2032
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:25,270
Hoarding has nothing to do with stuff.
It's about that desire.

2033
01:50:25,271 --> 01:50:29,930
It's about that self worth. It's about
that, that giving yourself knee, you know,

2034
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:33,340
you were all so needy and, and, and
this is where I, people get tired of me.

2035
01:50:33,341 --> 01:50:36,850
They're like, you're looked through
some awful, you know, mentalist. I just,

2036
01:50:36,910 --> 01:50:38,860
I believe a mentalist.
Why we're there to meet people.

2037
01:50:38,861 --> 01:50:41,980
Just people think I get a little preachy
and I guess I do. Well listen, you're,

2038
01:50:41,981 --> 01:50:44,260
you're saying your story passionately,

2039
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:47,050
absolutely is a story that
should be preached. I mean,

2040
01:50:47,051 --> 01:50:49,960
if there's a story that should be
preached to suck a Dick for money,

2041
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:52,790
and now all of a sudden he's on TV
and he's doing great and he's, he's,

2042
01:50:52,791 --> 01:50:56,710
he's helping people and he's
helping inmates a, you know,
get their shit together.

2043
01:50:56,890 --> 01:51:00,250
That's all beautiful when it, when you
look at that in turn the TV, there it is.

2044
01:51:00,251 --> 01:51:03,910
And that was, it was a black cat and it
was a flat cat. He actually was on a,

2045
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:07,570
it was on a box. So he's like, he was
the at 90 degree angle. There he is.

2046
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:12,460
There's this gun. Oh, Jesus
Christ. Now this gun. Yeah,
he just fucking sprayed me.

2047
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:16,620
Clearly. That's a while back. I'm a
little lighter. Oh my God. This is crazy.

2048
01:51:17,650 --> 01:51:19,960
This is crazy.
That Ha,

2049
01:51:19,990 --> 01:51:23,070
that whole room was six feet
higher about eight hours earlier.

2050
01:51:25,730 --> 01:51:27,160
Oh my God.
Another cat.

2051
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:30,430
Now that these people get in
trouble with like animal protein,

2052
01:51:30,431 --> 01:51:34,660
animal protection called us into this
one. This was in New Mexico. And, um,

2053
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:37,960
Jesus Christ,
35 she thought she had like 10 cats.

2054
01:51:37,961 --> 01:51:41,590
She didn't know how many she had. So
they all starve to death out there. Yeah,

2055
01:51:41,591 --> 01:51:44,650
most, I mean, we always say triple
it. If you think, if the person says,

2056
01:51:44,651 --> 01:51:48,550
I have 105 10 cats, will they have, if
they have a, say they have a hundred cats,

2057
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:53,170
they have 300 cats. Like they don't
know the rates that cats can reproduce.

2058
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:55,700
And so they never see the baby,
the cancer fucking and breeding.

2059
01:51:55,701 --> 01:52:00,520
They're like rabbits. They
feed on each other. Whoever
dies, they, it's, I mean it's,

2060
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:05,140
she's riced so they're just,
babies are eating absolutely.

2061
01:52:05,230 --> 01:52:09,100
Whatever one, it's, it's total natural
selection. Oh my God. That whatever is,

2062
01:52:09,290 --> 01:52:13,330
and it's all underneath eight feet
of stuff. So you don't see it.

2063
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:17,890
You don't see it. It's not a problem. This
is my very first one favorite guy ever.

2064
01:52:18,430 --> 01:52:20,360
This guy,
his whole yard was a junk yard yard.

2065
01:52:20,361 --> 01:52:25,000
It looks like John Paul Love that guy.
That bus.

2066
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:29,650
So what's happening? You could see
this from space and Google. Wow.

2067
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:34,330
You can see this guy's yard and it was
a deep South Alabama and the government

2068
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:37,660
was after him. They wanted the
land. He moved out to the country.

2069
01:52:37,690 --> 01:52:41,830
To get away from the city and the city
caught up with them over 20 some years.

2070
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,940
This was crazy. I had never, I
love this story specializes in,

2071
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:49,160
I hit an effective,
never done hoarding.

2072
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:53,420
I mean it never been in TV before and
so I got called on a Monday. They said,

2073
01:52:53,421 --> 01:52:54,800
can you come down and do this show?

2074
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:59,330
So I was still cleaning houses for 12
bucks an hour and then get called down to

2075
01:52:59,331 --> 01:53:01,700
go do this show. And that
was, that was on a Wednesday.

2076
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:04,870
So three days later I was doing
a TV show, Alabama. He's charged.

2077
01:53:04,871 --> 01:53:09,410
I've never been on,
that's $250 and 90 days in jail.

2078
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:12,890
Just kind of hunting the dirty way. Not
Kinda hot. That girl, that's ginger.

2079
01:53:12,891 --> 01:53:17,300
She was very hot.
The three or four glasses of whiskey.

2080
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:21,710
Ginger was her name. Let's get
crazy. She got cowboy boots on.

2081
01:53:21,711 --> 01:53:25,610
Hot School girl.

2082
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:30,530
Actually that house man, we
took out. So cool thing that
we took out. Proud. I mean,

2083
01:53:30,531 --> 01:53:33,590
I think we took out like a
hundred some cars. You, the tires,

2084
01:53:33,591 --> 01:53:37,050
you can't get rid of it soon as possible
to get rid of tires naturally or, uh,

2085
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:39,170
I mean legally how to get rid of him.

2086
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:42,560
You have to send them to a shredder
and then they shred them up for like

2087
01:53:42,561 --> 01:53:46,850
playgrounds to like be floors.
The problem is to recycle things legally.

2088
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:49,700
It's very hard in America right now.
It's very different.

2089
01:53:49,701 --> 01:53:54,530
The laws are so super green. No, well
the green lawn is a very difficult, um,

2090
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:59,600
this guy, he was a big school bus in his
yard and I was like, Paul w we got it.

2091
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:02,780
We got to get rid of these. Uh, we
got to get rid of these, this bus man.

2092
01:54:02,781 --> 01:54:04,370
Like what are, we can do it.
It was filled with copper.

2093
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:08,150
So it was probably 10 grand
worth of copper. Wow. And
the metal was very valuable,

2094
01:54:08,151 --> 01:54:10,400
especially in the south. And so this
guy had, I mean that bus right there.

2095
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:12,320
So it's like we got rid of
the bus and he goes, man,

2096
01:54:12,321 --> 01:54:16,930
last time I had sex was in that
bus. And I go, I go, Paul Women's.

2097
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:21,200
The last time you had sex,
and he goes, junior, how old?

2098
01:54:21,201 --> 01:54:25,340
He yells to his son. His son is like
43 years old now, has like five kids.

2099
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:31,240
They edited that out. They didn't. Joey,
did he have sex with a dead cat now?

2100
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:34,490
He was like, you know, most quarters
are totally, I do have a flashlights.

2101
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:38,660
Flush story. Can I tell it real quick?
Most orders are totally asexual.

2102
01:54:38,661 --> 01:54:42,620
They don't have space in their mind
force for sexuality. Feelings. Yeah.

2103
01:54:42,621 --> 01:54:45,740
Most of them are, haven't had
sex in 2030 years. It's not.

2104
01:54:45,741 --> 01:54:50,090
He's not even like sex motivates
everything I do like I believe life.

2105
01:54:50,150 --> 01:54:53,900
I truly believe wife revolves around
sex like deep. You dig deep enough.

2106
01:54:53,901 --> 01:54:57,230
Everything you do is to get laid.
I really believe that. Freud,

2107
01:54:58,670 --> 01:55:01,220
I do believe that.
I think every EMEA at the end of the day,

2108
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:04,550
I'm trying to impress my
wife, Deb sexton. Me. Really?

2109
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:08,760
Why do I work hard to make my wife happy?
Why don't we make my wife happy? Wow.

2110
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:15,230
Yeah. Well, I hate that word,
but my dad always used to it.

2111
01:55:15,231 --> 01:55:17,480
My Dad's a big part of my life all,
he's been dead for 10 years.

2112
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:19,910
He always told me he was in advertising.

2113
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:22,970
He said everything is about
trying to get laid. He said,

2114
01:55:22,971 --> 01:55:25,220
that's all advertising is.
You just got to find out how to get laid.

2115
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:27,470
I think that's certainly a desire,

2116
01:55:27,471 --> 01:55:29,840
but that's just because we have
a constant need to reproduce a,

2117
01:55:29,841 --> 01:55:32,150
we're always horny,
but I don't think it's about reproduction,

2118
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:37,330
reproduction. I don't think
it goes that deep. Unintended.

2119
01:55:37,610 --> 01:55:40,400
Well that's for you buddy. I
think I, yeah, and I'm saying,

2120
01:55:40,401 --> 01:55:42,590
I'm sure there's other people that don't
believe that. Well, I know there's just,

2121
01:55:42,591 --> 01:55:45,630
there's a lot of other experiences in
life that are pretty fucking fascinating.

2122
01:55:45,631 --> 01:55:48,300
So it's just getting laid
hold on the ass jokes,

2123
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:49,890
but not the back to the beginning.

2124
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:54,480
You got to allow yourself to go to that
next level because a lot of people stop

2125
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:58,950
at the, okay, I'm just gonna make my
wife happy and get laid. And then once,

2126
01:55:58,951 --> 01:56:01,260
like you said, you were
talking about your, um,

2127
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:06,840
that isolation tank thing
that blew me away. Like I did.

2128
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:09,330
I did about a two week thing
after right after my dad died,

2129
01:56:09,331 --> 01:56:14,331
I ran away to Maui and was living in
Hawaii with an ex girlfriend and that was

2130
01:56:14,761 --> 01:56:17,640
when I started. Okay. My mind
became open to life and I was like,

2131
01:56:17,641 --> 01:56:21,450
I'm post gambling or Miranda
ruin is trying to figure it out.

2132
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:26,010
But I hadn't hit rock bottom yet.
No. Well I mean I had hit it.

2133
01:56:26,030 --> 01:56:27,360
Have you gotten beat up yet?
Yeah,

2134
01:56:27,361 --> 01:56:29,580
it was about five months after
my dad died right after that.

2135
01:56:29,581 --> 01:56:30,780
So of course that has
something to do with it.

2136
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:33,510
But I was talking to my ex girlfriend and
she, and she's like, how are you doing?

2137
01:56:33,511 --> 01:56:36,360
I was like, I'm not good. And she
said, well you can be not good in Maui.

2138
01:56:36,450 --> 01:56:41,130
And I was like, good point. Yeah, she's
a great girl. Yeah, she's a good girl.

2139
01:56:41,590 --> 01:56:45,870
So I moved to Maui, was living with her
and I went on a week trip through Han.

2140
01:56:45,871 --> 01:56:48,960
I don't know if you've ever done that.
Road to Hana is the backside of Maui.

2141
01:56:48,961 --> 01:56:51,900
It's a dirt road and I just hiked it.
I just walked through.

2142
01:56:51,901 --> 01:56:56,760
Hannah and I met this family living out
in the rain forest and they were doing a

2143
01:56:56,761 --> 01:57:00,990
lot of, a lot of acid and a lot of stuff.
That family living in the rain forest,

2144
01:57:01,070 --> 01:57:04,440
there's, I mean there's a lot of
houses. It wasn't like just, just read.

2145
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:06,810
What does it like, like what kind
of people are living up there?

2146
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:11,070
I mean old hippies. Woody Harrelson live
up there. A Willie Nelson lived, right?

2147
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:15,600
No Heraldry Hillary does. Willy Nelson
lived right up the street from Havana.

2148
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:18,450
Willie Nelson lived in Hawaii. It's
kind of great. The house up there. Yeah,

2149
01:57:18,451 --> 01:57:21,650
he's got a great ranch up in my, probably
like balling. He's got houses all over.

2150
01:57:21,670 --> 01:57:24,420
He's got a suite.
It's called an [inaudible] [inaudible].

2151
01:57:24,430 --> 01:57:28,290
He is a figure eight the island. And he
lives on the upper side, which is country.

2152
01:57:28,950 --> 01:57:32,280
It's about that keratosis.
Bunch of Spanish cowboys
came there a long time ago.

2153
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:35,280
So there's a big, uh, like
horse community on that,

2154
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:38,840
on the higher upper side of
West Maui. Yeah, it's a mal,

2155
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:41,670
he's amazing place and it's,
it's backs right up to the back,

2156
01:57:41,671 --> 01:57:45,990
right up to the rain forest.
Don't local behaviors. People,

2157
01:57:46,070 --> 01:57:48,810
they fucking hate it. They're
called Holly's, they hate
us with all our passion.

2158
01:57:49,050 --> 01:57:51,600
We just recently we stole that island.

2159
01:57:51,630 --> 01:57:54,510
I mean Americans like in of what forties
we stole that. We killed their queen.

2160
01:57:54,990 --> 01:57:56,670
We killed their queen solutely Dole,

2161
01:57:56,700 --> 01:58:01,650
the Dole Fruit company and the Americans
killed their queen to get a place to

2162
01:58:01,651 --> 01:58:05,730
land airplanes. Really? They
hate them. They hate white
people so bad. Passionately.

2163
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,950
Well, they're always nice. We
stole her fucking one. Yeah.

2164
01:58:07,951 --> 01:58:11,940
But now you get 10 minutes off. Resort
been fucking story before too. I've,

2165
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:14,880
I've met a lot of friendly Palette,
but you get a pass and a lot.

2166
01:58:14,881 --> 01:58:16,860
I think you're a likable guy
and you're an honest guy.

2167
01:58:16,861 --> 01:58:20,620
You get a pass and they
like Bj Penn. He's, yeah,

2168
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:24,740
he's a whole wise when that hole, when
that, oh, I know when that whole, um,

2169
01:58:25,410 --> 01:58:30,130
tsunami came in. He had to Bj Penn
Cam on top of it. So everybody,

2170
01:58:30,790 --> 01:58:34,790
everybody was CNN. Everybody
was doing the Bj Penn. Yeah.

2171
01:58:34,791 --> 01:58:39,630
We were just told this by a brat. It
was crazy. Yeah. Brad has to be the guy.

2172
01:58:39,631 --> 01:58:42,070
I wanted to ask your opinion this year.
I'm not a huge MMA

2173
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,620
guy. I do joy watching it
with my wife's not around.

2174
01:58:44,970 --> 01:58:49,480
What about when she's around and try to
make her happy hours and we watch bravo.

2175
01:58:49,810 --> 01:58:52,690
Bravo together. Yeah. Did it is
what it is. I gotta I gotta survive.

2176
01:58:53,550 --> 01:58:57,340
It is what it is. I love my wife.
She runs her life. Wow. Yeah.

2177
01:58:57,341 --> 01:59:01,940
That Uriah faber guy. Yeah.
I used to watch him when he
was a lot smaller. No, no.

2178
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:05,530
He smaller now than he's ever been.
Really? He looks so much big. No,

2179
01:59:05,531 --> 01:59:08,050
he started off his career.
He fought a few fights.

2180
01:59:08,051 --> 01:59:12,340
I think he fought a 55 that he
dropped down to 45 won the title last,

2181
01:59:12,341 --> 01:59:16,660
the title of 45 to Mike Brown. Uh,
lost an attempt at it again to Brown.

2182
01:59:16,661 --> 01:59:20,110
That lost again to Josaih Aldo.
So it dropped down to 35 for that.

2183
01:59:20,111 --> 01:59:24,640
Now he is coaching 35. Well,
he's doesn't weigh one 35.

2184
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:28,620
He cuts it down to one 30 so he doesn't
really fight at either. He just doubled.

2185
01:59:28,630 --> 01:59:31,480
It's really stupid. They
weigh in at it. I mean,

2186
01:59:31,481 --> 01:59:35,440
I shouldn't say that day they own,
they weigh one to four, you know,

2187
01:59:35,441 --> 01:59:39,180
it's usually for an hour or two,
one 50 something.

2188
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:42,940
He probably weighs close to
one 50 something, you know,

2189
01:59:42,941 --> 01:59:46,140
when he gets into the octagon 20
pounds of water, you know, I mean,

2190
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:48,880
I wouldn't say it'd be that much because
that seems like that would wear him

2191
01:59:48,881 --> 01:59:50,960
down, you know, because
as you, um, you know,

2192
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:53,200
pounds mean more of a
percentage of body weight.

2193
01:59:53,201 --> 01:59:54,340
When you get to a smaller person,

2194
01:59:54,341 --> 01:59:57,820
you don't think it was like a big
wrestler can cut 20 pounds, no problem.

2195
01:59:58,360 --> 02:00:01,630
But you know, he's walking around at 220
pounds. He's cutting 20 pounds of water.

2196
02:00:01,631 --> 02:00:02,920
It's easy.
It makes two oh five.

2197
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:07,480
There's a big difference between that and
a guy who's won 50 cutting down to one

2198
02:00:07,570 --> 02:00:10,930
30 there's a percentage,
the percentage of body weight.

2199
02:00:10,931 --> 02:00:12,460
He's a master for 20 pounds if that way.

2200
02:00:12,461 --> 02:00:15,870
But people do some really dangerous
shit. We've had guys black out. You know,

2201
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:17,860
it's a, it's, it's a
real tricky, you know,

2202
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:22,690
the more ones that are handled by great
professional gyms and do it healthily

2203
02:00:22,691 --> 02:00:25,960
and like, like guys like George
Saint Pierre Anderson Silva,

2204
02:00:25,961 --> 02:00:29,200
they cut weight but you never
see them looking scared properly.

2205
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:32,930
They never look gaunt. Scary. Like
Anderson Silva. I know he gots wait,

2206
02:00:32,980 --> 02:00:37,780
but he never looks bad. So He's, he's
only cutting the what needs to be cut.

2207
02:00:37,781 --> 02:00:40,190
They've got it down to a science.
The smart guys do good ones,

2208
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:41,860
but every now and then
guys will take a chance.

2209
02:00:41,861 --> 02:00:44,410
It's just an unfortunate and
aspect of the game. I watched a,

2210
02:00:44,690 --> 02:00:48,040
not a dichotomy but a TV show
about the guys that bought the UFC.

2211
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:51,580
Fascinating man. Just fascinating
how they bought it from that.

2212
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:54,310
It was such a circus. At one
point. I was in the old circus.

2213
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:57,610
I used to work fight on circus.
No, no, no. I used to be
the post fight interviewer.

2214
02:00:58,090 --> 02:01:01,990
I was, I was involved in
both organizations. I was
involved in the old one. Yeah,

2215
02:01:02,050 --> 02:01:07,050
I did the old one from 1997 I did 97
and 98 and then I quit and then the new

2216
02:01:08,741 --> 02:01:12,040
company came along. They bought
it in 2001 and I started working.

2217
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:16,870
Guys not put money into that. Yeah, the
Fertittas. Yeah. Frank and Lorenzo. Great.

2218
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:20,090
Couldn't be better. Perfect. If
you know, we always said when,

2219
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:23,160
when I was a fan back in
the day, we said, you know,

2220
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:25,450
it'd be awesome if some really loked out.

2221
02:01:25,451 --> 02:01:28,750
Billionaire dudes just became a huge
fans of the sport and just through a

2222
02:01:28,751 --> 02:01:32,110
shitload of money on it. We know beauty
and that's exactly what happened.

2223
02:01:32,510 --> 02:01:32,830
You know,

2224
02:01:32,830 --> 02:01:36,190
there was one point in time while they
were financing the ultimate fighter and

2225
02:01:36,191 --> 02:01:40,100
putting it all together,
they were over $44 million in the hole.

2226
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:44,060
$44 million that I need
from a business in the red.

2227
02:01:44,090 --> 02:01:47,450
That is unreal. Yeah, it's craziness.

2228
02:01:47,451 --> 02:01:51,350
You have to make that million phenomenal
ratings. It does. Now. It does. Well now,

2229
02:01:51,351 --> 02:01:54,740
now it's alive. Actually. Now the
ultimate fighter is alive on Fx,

2230
02:01:54,741 --> 02:01:57,230
so you get to watch the fights
as they happen, as they happen,

2231
02:01:57,500 --> 02:02:00,260
which is pretty bad ass. It's a new
thing that they're doing this time.

2232
02:02:00,970 --> 02:02:03,600
I mean, I just, I'm amazed by the
business side of it. I mean, you're,

2233
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:07,820
the CEO was adversely a bad ass. I mean,
he's the more and more I hear him talk,

2234
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:12,080
what's his name? He loves
it. He loves the sport.

2235
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:16,800
He knows how to do it correctly. Yeah,
he did. I do it like nobody works.

2236
02:02:16,801 --> 02:02:20,440
Start as that guy. I do ONA a bunch and
they've just swear by that guy. I mean,

2237
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:22,450
they were like just blown
away by him. Yeah, I do.

2238
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:24,950
And A to every time I'm in New York,
I love those guys.

2239
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:28,370
That's the best radio show.
They crack me up. Jimmy Norton.

2240
02:02:28,371 --> 02:02:32,120
Kenny's the funniest fucking guy. I
never, he's kind radio ever. Jim Norton.

2241
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:34,610
No doubt. Wait another one
back. John is, he is who he is.

2242
02:02:34,611 --> 02:02:37,770
He's fine with it was totally fine
with it. If you don't like it,

2243
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:41,120
who gives a shit? Who the fuck else was
joking about getting blown by training.

2244
02:02:41,121 --> 02:02:43,750
He's like, Jimmy, you know what I
mean? Jimmy brings it up on that.

2245
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:48,130
You're a fucking idiot for knocking
one by training. Yeah, sounds awesome.

2246
02:02:48,131 --> 02:02:52,070
Sounds delicious. And then he somehow gets
on window and I'm like, God, this guy,

2247
02:02:52,071 --> 02:02:54,200
I mean, he just blows me
away. He's amazing man.

2248
02:02:54,230 --> 02:02:57,380
So I hopefully I'll have a
lot of listeners coming in
from my guys listening to

2249
02:02:57,381 --> 02:03:00,810
this one. Give me kind of the
five second pitch. Like I'm,

2250
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:03,280
when I now watching the man,
I'm blown away by a man.

2251
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:06,110
Like it totally blows me away.
Why is it so much better than boxing?

2252
02:03:06,111 --> 02:03:07,310
Because boxing is boring now.

2253
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:12,460
Um, well, you know what it is. It's not
that it's better than boxing, it's just,

2254
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:17,520
it's just boxing is only one aspect of
a real fight in boxing is very exciting.

2255
02:03:18,090 --> 02:03:19,830
You know, if you watch a good, like if,

2256
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:23,920
if you Manny Pacquiao was going to fight
pretty boy Floyd or like go back in

2257
02:03:23,921 --> 02:03:27,160
time and watch like Tommy Hearns and
sugar ray Leonard or you know, there's,

2258
02:03:27,161 --> 02:03:27,850
there's some great,

2259
02:03:27,850 --> 02:03:29,310
finally we're growing up.
Any,

2260
02:03:29,311 --> 02:03:33,180
any Tyson fight when I was in high
school and closer massacre was huge,

2261
02:03:33,420 --> 02:03:36,760
but it was still the buzz, the
excitement and it was all paper. If you,

2262
02:03:36,761 --> 02:03:38,310
everybody would eat, he
didn't care. I mean I would,

2263
02:03:38,370 --> 02:03:43,370
we would drive to a cable place to buy
some type of chip that allowed us to

2264
02:03:43,381 --> 02:03:47,640
watch the Tyson fight and we,
everyone pitched in like $2 to do it.

2265
02:03:48,270 --> 02:03:50,320
You know, I don't know. We
know that boxing now. Well

2266
02:03:50,350 --> 02:03:52,770
we'll watch it again. I
still life boxing. Yeah.

2267
02:03:52,780 --> 02:03:56,560
You can't tell me that a fight like
Meldrick Taylor and Julio, Cesar Chavez,

2268
02:03:56,561 --> 02:03:58,990
like one of those fights,
like that's an exciting fight.

2269
02:03:58,991 --> 02:04:01,390
It's exciting and it's not the same.
You know,

2270
02:04:01,391 --> 02:04:04,900
when a guy can't take a guy down where
a guy can't throw kicks and it's,

2271
02:04:04,901 --> 02:04:07,960
it's really not the same.
But under those rules,

2272
02:04:07,961 --> 02:04:09,740
like in choosing to fight that way it's,

2273
02:04:09,741 --> 02:04:13,030
it's very fascinating to watch
like who's who's better at it,

2274
02:04:13,031 --> 02:04:15,130
you respect the law regardless
of the type of fight.

2275
02:04:15,150 --> 02:04:18,340
I just respect someone who
is very skillful at anything,

2276
02:04:18,341 --> 02:04:19,810
whatever skillful at boxing.

2277
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:23,410
I love watching Floyd Mayweather fight
and one of the things I like watching a

2278
02:04:23,411 --> 02:04:27,070
fight about is how smart he is about
avoiding danger. He very rarely gets head.

2279
02:04:27,250 --> 02:04:31,240
He's very smart at moving.
He's very smart at it. Timing,

2280
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:35,110
he's very smart defensively,
keeps his hands in the proper position.

2281
02:04:35,111 --> 02:04:37,860
He very rarely gets clipped and when he
does get clipped he recovers very well.

2282
02:04:37,861 --> 02:04:38,050
He said

2283
02:04:38,050 --> 02:04:38,850
he's just,

2284
02:04:38,850 --> 02:04:42,870
he's like real slick about the actual
art form of boxing and when you see like

2285
02:04:42,871 --> 02:04:46,350
him fight a guy like sugar Shane Mosley
and essentially just shut them down.

2286
02:04:46,830 --> 02:04:48,780
That's an amazing accomplishment.

2287
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:52,530
You've got to realize how good sugar Shane
Mosley is and then you can appreciate

2288
02:04:52,531 --> 02:04:56,400
what you see Floyd Mayweather do. You
know, and the guy like Manny Pacquiao,

2289
02:04:56,401 --> 02:05:00,750
just beets, sugar, Shane Mosley senseless.
That's an incredible accomplishment.

2290
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:03,360
You like,
if you know how good Shane is there,

2291
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:06,110
you see like the Shane Margarito fight
when he just chewed Margarito up.

2292
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:11,010
Shane Mosley is a beast. So I'm, I'm a fan
of anybody who is skillful at anything.

2293
02:05:11,011 --> 02:05:14,310
I don't think if that, I'm a fan of people
that are skillful gymnast, you know,

2294
02:05:14,311 --> 02:05:15,330
I'll watch the scene.

2295
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:20,100
There's a video out here of this dude
came out last week of this butcher tearing

2296
02:05:20,101 --> 02:05:24,000
apart a pig in two minutes. Jesus
Christ fucking art. It's amazing.

2297
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:28,620
This guy and it minutes meaning
a whole pig. It's fucking,

2298
02:05:28,650 --> 02:05:31,790
it's art. It's amazing. What do
you find that? It's on youtube.

2299
02:05:32,050 --> 02:05:35,700
It's like two minutes, two minutes.
But it's like, I was like, holy crap,

2300
02:05:35,701 --> 02:05:38,130
I want to be a butcher. Like I
like, you know, I was like, man,

2301
02:05:38,131 --> 02:05:40,950
this is beautiful for me.
Understand why I just enjoy who.

2302
02:05:40,951 --> 02:05:44,250
If you're good at something and you're
totally passionate about it, awesome.

2303
02:05:44,251 --> 02:05:45,390
I don't care what it is.

2304
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:49,020
I never thought I would be in the
watching shows on cooking until I started

2305
02:05:49,021 --> 02:05:53,490
watching shit. This is awesome.
That I never see ever come in here.

2306
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:57,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was
awesome. It was great, dude, too.

2307
02:05:57,090 --> 02:05:59,090
Is this the guy going to do it?
All right. He's going to shoot.

2308
02:05:59,370 --> 02:06:03,550
This guy is going to watch this guy do
this whole pig in two minutes now goes

2309
02:06:03,551 --> 02:06:07,150
ahead, but wow. It's so ruthless.
It's really crazy when you see it,

2310
02:06:07,151 --> 02:06:09,910
like sectioned up like that.
It doesn't look like an animal anymore.

2311
02:06:10,510 --> 02:06:13,480
Once it starts getting sectioned,
it just becomes like meat.

2312
02:06:14,590 --> 02:06:16,870
I heard him interviewed about it the
other day and he goes, I just, he goes,

2313
02:06:16,871 --> 02:06:20,380
I really love the art of butchering,
and I just wanted people to see it.

2314
02:06:22,030 --> 02:06:26,380
I really love the art of glittering Jesus
Christ and they never thought about it

2315
02:06:26,381 --> 02:06:30,490
that way. Oh, and like you don't realize,
I mean these knives, but they would,

2316
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:33,370
you'd take your leg off
like that. Oh yeah. I mean,

2317
02:06:33,371 --> 02:06:36,020
he's cutting right through
meat and bone and bone. Yeah.

2318
02:06:36,070 --> 02:06:40,870
That's the same as your leg. Oh, Jesus
got a song. It's unreal, man. Holy Fuck.

2319
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:41,980
Yeah.

2320
02:06:41,980 --> 02:06:45,950
How many people are completely removed
from this aspect of eating you go to?

2321
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:47,020
That's why he did it.

2322
02:06:47,021 --> 02:06:49,930
He said he wanted people to respect what
they eat and he wanted people to see

2323
02:06:49,931 --> 02:06:51,340
that they're only eating good things.

2324
02:06:51,370 --> 02:06:55,870
It's really amazing what we've done in
a society by creating cities and having

2325
02:06:55,871 --> 02:06:58,840
supermarkets.
We've got completely taken the,

2326
02:06:58,870 --> 02:07:02,350
the gathering and hunting
out of, uh, out of our lives.

2327
02:07:02,351 --> 02:07:06,700
My grandparents lived in a tiny
little town way north of Denver,

2328
02:07:06,730 --> 02:07:09,440
but up in the middle of nowhere.
And they would only, if they,

2329
02:07:09,460 --> 02:07:11,560
they would hunt it or
grow it and that was it.

2330
02:07:11,980 --> 02:07:16,780
I bet there were healthiest fuck that he
had. I lived to like, what, 85 lb? Shit,

2331
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:20,250
they worked in the farm every day. Look
at the body cavity that's left over now.

2332
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:24,400
Jesus Christ. Think of the confidence
with that knife it takes to like, yeah,

2333
02:07:24,401 --> 02:07:27,350
he's pulling out the loin now.
This is where like tenderloin,

2334
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:28,061
you know what that is?

2335
02:07:28,061 --> 02:07:33,061
It's the warmth of the slab of meat that
covers your spine and even like dresses

2336
02:07:33,851 --> 02:07:35,800
the Bacon and I just think it's amazing.

2337
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:39,190
That was the tendo one that he just
pulled out right there and they slept them

2338
02:07:39,191 --> 02:07:41,760
the other side of it right now.
That's crazy, man. This guys,

2339
02:07:42,910 --> 02:07:47,890
I watched it like three times. Yeah. I
don't think I really like watching this.

2340
02:07:48,020 --> 02:07:48,853
It doesn't bother me.

2341
02:07:48,970 --> 02:07:52,480
Doesn't mean it's interesting when he
hits me on it is the confidence. Okay.

2342
02:07:52,481 --> 02:07:52,960
I just,

2343
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:57,640
I really respect confidence of whatever
you do and this dude is confident enough

2344
02:07:57,641 --> 02:08:01,480
to just throw this thing around the,
we've sure knows what the fuck he's doing.

2345
02:08:01,481 --> 02:08:02,580
Knows every single step.

2346
02:08:02,610 --> 02:08:05,320
He knows what he's doing in three or
four steps and I just, I admire that.

2347
02:08:05,321 --> 02:08:07,360
I think it's awesome.
He set the bar for butchers.

2348
02:08:07,361 --> 02:08:10,070
I'll tell you that there's a lot of guys
going to need a half an hour at least a

2349
02:08:10,110 --> 02:08:12,000
quick wrap up hearing this motherfucker.

2350
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:16,590
Just do that in two minutes
and I put it on youtube now.

2351
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:22,340
He probably went to school for five years
to that, you know, or, or practice I,

2352
02:08:22,410 --> 02:08:25,630
you went to school for a year and then
practiced for five or 10 years to do that.

2353
02:08:25,810 --> 02:08:29,250
Wow. And this is so random, but I just,
I just think shit like that. It's just,

2354
02:08:29,810 --> 02:08:32,770
I think we're all attracted to people
that are really passionate about what they

2355
02:08:32,771 --> 02:08:35,920
do and really excellent at what
they do. Because, you know,

2356
02:08:35,921 --> 02:08:37,540
you tune into that and
you go, wow, you know,

2357
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:39,820
that kind of translates into
anything you wanted to. You know,

2358
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:42,650
this guy who's great at being a guitarist,
you know,

2359
02:08:42,651 --> 02:08:45,310
it could be great at being a butcher
or it could be great at being a chef.

2360
02:08:45,311 --> 02:08:48,610
You gotta be crazy. You know, if he had
that sort of same focus at that, you know,

2361
02:08:48,611 --> 02:08:52,090
you watch a guy who was great
at a carpentry are great
at anything. It's, it's,

2362
02:08:52,091 --> 02:08:54,140
it's, it's, there's something that it,

2363
02:08:54,410 --> 02:08:58,390
it elevates us to watch other people
would be really good at stuff. Well, yeah,

2364
02:08:58,450 --> 02:09:02,710
I mean, don't you do that?
Sure. I mean, you're, you're,
you're a fight or not. I mean,

2365
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:05,640
I did when I was young,
I did a lot of taekwondo tournament,

2366
02:09:05,641 --> 02:09:08,580
so I did some kickboxing,
but it was before the UFC.

2367
02:09:08,581 --> 02:09:11,380
He was around and then by
the time the UFC was around,

2368
02:09:11,381 --> 02:09:15,160
I was already on TV and I was just trying
to make it out here and I was trying

2369
02:09:15,161 --> 02:09:18,160
to be a standup comedian and
I, it, it never even existed,

2370
02:09:18,161 --> 02:09:21,690
but I had to learn Jiu Jitsu. I had
to, because all my life I had been, uh,

2371
02:09:21,790 --> 02:09:23,740
involved as striking.
That's all I've ever done.

2372
02:09:24,010 --> 02:09:27,820
And the UFC just made me realize like,
wow, there's some shit you need to learn.

2373
02:09:27,850 --> 02:09:30,550
I need to learn submissions.
You had to come in. I mean,

2374
02:09:30,580 --> 02:09:33,520
even to both fighting into anticodon.
I mean how many,

2375
02:09:33,521 --> 02:09:35,410
how many you guys said you spent 10 years.

2376
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:39,550
I wasn't qualified to do anything else,
man. No, I'm saying comedy. Yeah, comedy.

2377
02:09:39,551 --> 02:09:41,920
It wasn't mean I could have done martial
arts, could have taught martial arts,

2378
02:09:41,921 --> 02:09:43,630
but like regular jobs,

2379
02:09:43,810 --> 02:09:48,760
I had sort of chasing martial arts and
become completely obsessed and focusing

2380
02:09:48,761 --> 02:09:51,100
100% of all my energy
and efforts on one thing.

2381
02:09:51,310 --> 02:09:55,720
I have basically completely neglected
my schoolwork. Completely neglected.

2382
02:09:55,721 --> 02:09:58,540
Some idea of a safety net. I didn't
have a safety net. I wouldn't,

2383
02:09:58,541 --> 02:10:02,100
it wasn't even thinking about the
potential for failing in life. It just,

2384
02:10:02,290 --> 02:10:03,130
I wasn't thinking about it.

2385
02:10:03,131 --> 02:10:07,360
I was just trying to get excellent at
martial arts and then when I realized that

2386
02:10:07,361 --> 02:10:10,480
I was going to have a different sort
of a job and I was going to have a

2387
02:10:10,481 --> 02:10:12,970
different career, I, there
was a moment where I was like,

2388
02:10:12,971 --> 02:10:15,850
what am I going to do next? And then I
found comedy and it was like really quick.

2389
02:10:15,851 --> 02:10:18,970
It was like, boom, this is it. Well
that was my moment when I realized,

2390
02:10:19,430 --> 02:10:22,720
and this was after the, the rock bottom.
I mean I had a lot of, I mean I was very,

2391
02:10:22,721 --> 02:10:23,860
I mean I thought about killing myself.

2392
02:10:23,861 --> 02:10:27,880
I was very depressed and how are we
going to do if I thought about a gun,

2393
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:33,170
I didn't, I drove towards Walmart
and I was to buy a gun. I was like,

2394
02:10:33,171 --> 02:10:34,010
what the fuck am I

2395
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:37,250
doing that close? No, I don't
want to act like I bought a gun.

2396
02:10:37,251 --> 02:10:39,650
I did what you thought of. I thought
about it because I really got to point.

2397
02:10:39,651 --> 02:10:41,390
It was like, when I was going to
call this wedding off, I was like,

2398
02:10:41,391 --> 02:10:45,080
it would just be better if I'm gone
and no one gets hurt. And I was like,

2399
02:10:46,310 --> 02:10:47,360
yeah,
we'll get married.

2400
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:51,170
What upset her and I didn't
want to set my mom and I just,

2401
02:10:51,171 --> 02:10:53,010
I got to the point where I was like some,
you know,

2402
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:55,430
but then immediate it was like,
what the fuck are you thinking?

2403
02:10:55,431 --> 02:10:59,480
Like this is crazy. Right,
right. But there was a point
where I got so rock bottom,

2404
02:10:59,990 --> 02:11:03,830
I was like, okay, there's something
like this has gotta be good.

2405
02:11:03,831 --> 02:11:05,270
There's got to be good in this somewhere.

2406
02:11:05,870 --> 02:11:08,960
And so I always want to have it when I
have an audience as large as I'm going to

2407
02:11:08,961 --> 02:11:09,350
have here.

2408
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:12,140
I just want to make sure you guys like
if you're listening and you're down his

2409
02:11:12,141 --> 02:11:15,390
shit, man, there's something good.
It's going to come out of this again.

2410
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:19,400
My Dad dying was ended up being the best
thing that ever happened to me. Wow.

2411
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:22,310
Clearly I got my shit together.
My brother got his shit together,

2412
02:11:22,311 --> 02:11:25,010
all of his friends got sober.
Everybody got their shit together.

2413
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:28,610
My Dad did more by dying than he did
by living and my dad would love that.

2414
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:31,430
I say that all that my dad would love
that I'm saying this out loud to an

2415
02:11:31,431 --> 02:11:34,520
audience this big. He motivated me and a
lot of people to get the shit together.

2416
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:38,360
So for me, like that moment when I, and
I don't want to say it was an Aha moment,

2417
02:11:38,630 --> 02:11:40,550
but like when I realized
like, okay, wait a minute,

2418
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:43,790
I've gone really deep now if I just
embrace it and stop hiding it and not

2419
02:11:43,791 --> 02:11:44,810
telling people about it,

2420
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:49,040
like I should just totally tell everyone
about it and I'll do more with it.

2421
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:50,510
And that was after my,
whenever it was my dad,

2422
02:11:50,511 --> 02:11:55,511
like we were trying to make this this
funeral that was like all like perfect and

2423
02:11:55,551 --> 02:11:58,550
awesome and it was fake. And
then we just like, fuck it.

2424
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:00,170
We're just going to stand
up and tell the real story.

2425
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:03,540
And people celebrated the real
story and mean it was an hospital.

2426
02:12:04,130 --> 02:12:07,160
I think they can be honest.
I think they can be awesome.

2427
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:11,300
We had about 500 people that stood up
and drink beers and drink little shots of

2428
02:12:11,480 --> 02:12:14,150
doers and they told stories about like,
well that's great. It was awesome.

2429
02:12:14,210 --> 02:12:16,730
It was so great. A good group of
people around and pull that off.

2430
02:12:16,731 --> 02:12:21,020
It was a celebration. It was the last time
I was going to funeral. It was brutal.

2431
02:12:21,580 --> 02:12:25,250
Just family members crying and
everyone is depressed and whoa.

2432
02:12:25,251 --> 02:12:27,290
What was your fresh light
story going back? Oh,

2433
02:12:27,291 --> 02:12:31,000
flashline Mcnamara Norelle
comes back around. We did a, uh,

2434
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:34,970
we did a very early on and he's asked
me not to tell this story anymore. Why?

2435
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,690
We definitely say it's not an 80 house.
It's a house I did privately.

2436
02:12:39,130 --> 02:12:43,310
This is a bass you story at like the
Dildos when there's dildos and sex toys

2437
02:12:43,311 --> 02:12:46,830
involved. They don't like it. They don't
mind human shit. And finally he was 45,

2438
02:12:46,831 --> 02:12:51,410
but [inaudible] bundle line is still dead
cats. That's fine. Oh, wait a minute.

2439
02:12:51,411 --> 02:12:55,130
Does this give people pleasure in
their genitals? Not Interested.

2440
02:12:56,350 --> 02:12:59,750
So there's a bunch of back massagers bags.
You said this house,

2441
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:04,640
this dude collected, um, it was
a, it wasn't a private home.

2442
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:07,730
The family told us he was
dying of a heart disease.

2443
02:13:07,970 --> 02:13:11,270
So we walked into this thinking we're
cleaning the house to get hospice to be

2444
02:13:11,271 --> 02:13:13,370
allowed to come here.
We're fine with it.

2445
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:19,280
We start cleaning the house and right
away we're seeing a lot of like paper

2446
02:13:19,341 --> 02:13:23,090
porn,
like old swank magazines and you know,

2447
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:26,600
Shit that's got cum stains
on it. I mean, not digital.

2448
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:28,490
And so we're going,

2449
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:32,640
you see it physically when you see this
volume mean all of us watch a ton of

2450
02:13:32,641 --> 02:13:34,500
porn on,
on Internet.

2451
02:13:34,530 --> 02:13:36,990
But could you imagine if that was all
physical and you had just flip through

2452
02:13:36,991 --> 02:13:40,590
each, each magazine that you look at
and it's filled with all crusty thing.

2453
02:13:40,591 --> 02:13:41,101
So like,
I mean,

2454
02:13:41,101 --> 02:13:44,160
it was just this guy didn't get digital
yet and she just had tons and tons of

2455
02:13:44,161 --> 02:13:45,750
porn.
Probably no more than we look at it,

2456
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:49,320
but it just was physical and we're going
to the house and then at the deeper we

2457
02:13:49,321 --> 02:13:53,010
got, he got more aggressive. There
were some, there was some Disney porn,

2458
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:56,610
Disney characters drawn out.
Oh my God,

2459
02:13:57,240 --> 02:14:01,440
we found Polaroids. Oh,
like I said the other day,

2460
02:14:01,441 --> 02:14:04,950
like think of taking your picture
with your cell phone now of your deck.

2461
02:14:05,550 --> 02:14:08,610
Thank trying to do that with a Polaroid.
Wow. Like you've got to set it all up.

2462
02:14:08,611 --> 02:14:10,680
You got to pull the news,
your thing around. Yeah. Yeah.

2463
02:14:10,700 --> 02:14:12,780
I mean you've got to pull that
red button like it's not easy.

2464
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:18,030
And there were some kids and kids involved
in the polar and so we were like, Ooh,

2465
02:14:18,031 --> 02:14:20,280
I don't know. We're going, we've got
to call the cops at the same time.

2466
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:21,810
Some of my guys were in the back room,

2467
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:25,110
so there's this guy knew this stuff
was there. I didn't know he was,

2468
02:14:25,170 --> 02:14:27,030
he obviously knew it was there,

2469
02:14:27,031 --> 02:14:30,810
but in his mind he had justified it
that it was okay cause he's justified.

2470
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:33,690
It was okay to make it pictures of
kids probably because he was dying.

2471
02:14:34,170 --> 02:14:35,670
He didn't think anything wrong
with that's been in there.

2472
02:14:35,671 --> 02:14:39,440
He didn't think twice about it.
So same time, one of my guys stop,

2473
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:44,540
finds this really big flashlight that
he thinks and he opens it up and he's

2474
02:14:46,501 --> 02:14:49,680
like, that looks like
a vagina. Turns it up.

2475
02:14:49,710 --> 02:14:54,680
Oh. Turns it upside down and a
couple of things drop, add him.

2476
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:59,670
And then he realized what flashlights
and he tossed it across the room,

2477
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:03,810
the flashlight and we, that was our
first introduction to the flashlight.

2478
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:08,750
Wow. From some crazy hoarder
that saving his sperm in it

2479
02:15:12,090 --> 02:15:13,710
broadly.
I hate to say it,

2480
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:16,740
we always say it probably saved him from
going out and doing something crazy,

2481
02:15:16,741 --> 02:15:21,240
man. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Hopefully he ended
up going to jail. We had to call the cops.

2482
02:15:21,290 --> 02:15:24,120
Yeah. He went to jail for child
porn. He did? Yeah. For three.

2483
02:15:24,121 --> 02:15:27,060
We got three years and then when he
got out you get, yeah, that's it.

2484
02:15:27,390 --> 02:15:29,430
And he got out any, uh, I mean,

2485
02:15:29,431 --> 02:15:33,060
all the guys on my crew had served longer
time for like selling weed and that

2486
02:15:33,061 --> 02:15:36,330
dude was molested boys and
got three years, she gets out,

2487
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:41,550
gets out and he calls us to clean
the house again. Why? And I was like,

2488
02:15:41,770 --> 02:15:43,590
the house was messy and he
filled it up again in a year.

2489
02:15:45,230 --> 02:15:47,370
I think you guys might have cleaned
my house before and I was like,

2490
02:15:47,910 --> 02:15:50,940
you should still be in jail.
They do.

2491
02:15:50,970 --> 02:15:54,230
Child molesters cut their
flashlights in half. Oh,

2492
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:59,280
he'd give up on trauma listing. I Dunno.
We tell him, we tell him to fuck off.

2493
02:15:59,281 --> 02:16:02,400
Like we were just not interested.
We just couldn't believe that.

2494
02:16:02,401 --> 02:16:05,190
He called us back and was like,
Hey, can you help me creepy as fuck.

2495
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:08,610
We get some weird stuff, man. We,
and again it comes back to it.

2496
02:16:09,150 --> 02:16:12,810
What you see, I think, I
think life is subjective man.

2497
02:16:12,811 --> 02:16:15,150
Like what I see on a daily basis.

2498
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:18,360
So much more intense than what
someone might else might see.

2499
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:21,990
And so when I get it a hoarder, it's
just no big deal, man. It's no big deal.

2500
02:16:22,170 --> 02:16:24,240
But like there's,
I always say like I run me,

2501
02:16:24,241 --> 02:16:26,540
I run a lot of marathons and
when you are running a marathon,

2502
02:16:26,550 --> 02:16:28,260
there's always someone behind you.
I always say,

2503
02:16:28,261 --> 02:16:29,770
it doesn't matter how
bad a day you're having,

2504
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:33,070
there's always someone in the race
behind you. You never going to be last.

2505
02:16:33,730 --> 02:16:35,860
And one day I actually got
passed by a dude with a,

2506
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:40,630
he only had one leg and I had a really
bad marathon and about mile 18 where you

2507
02:16:40,631 --> 02:16:43,060
hit the wall. I was like,
Oh, I'm fucking dying.

2508
02:16:43,061 --> 02:16:46,480
And had my head down and I looked up
and this dude with one leg just fucking

2509
02:16:46,481 --> 02:16:47,314
hops by me.

2510
02:16:48,060 --> 02:16:51,180
Wow.
And I was like an artificial

2511
02:16:51,310 --> 02:16:55,570
leg, but he's only got one
leg and he kicked my ass.
Beat me by about 10 minutes.

2512
02:16:55,571 --> 02:16:58,990
How much of his leg was missing? The whole
lowest. I mean, it was way above thigh.

2513
02:16:59,020 --> 02:17:01,450
So that hurts. And the pain about
it is apparently it is not me.

2514
02:17:01,451 --> 02:17:05,020
It was way above the knee.
So he's running in pain the whole time.

2515
02:17:05,350 --> 02:17:08,080
And of course that means he'd be like,
well, fuck, if this guy can finish,

2516
02:17:08,081 --> 02:17:11,740
I better finish Jesus Christ. Let
me, for me, I always come back.

2517
02:17:11,741 --> 02:17:14,860
It's everything's mental.
Everything is mental. It's just,

2518
02:17:15,490 --> 02:17:17,410
are you going to quit before
you're willing to overtake it?

2519
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:20,800
There's a lot to learn for smell.
I mean,

2520
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:24,430
you shit happens and it's not your
fault. I get that. That's not mental.

2521
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:26,290
But if you're ever faced with quitting,

2522
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:28,990
that's up to you either quit or you don't.

2523
02:17:29,130 --> 02:17:30,960
But I thought quitting is good.
If a guy's beating your ass,

2524
02:17:30,990 --> 02:17:33,720
that's strategically stopping.
That's not cleaning.

2525
02:17:34,380 --> 02:17:38,130
That's a smart decision to stop.
You were beating the fuck out of me.

2526
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:41,160
I'd say I'm sorry. And get out of there.
That's just smart. That is smart. Yeah,

2527
02:17:41,161 --> 02:17:41,640
you're right.

2528
02:17:41,640 --> 02:17:44,940
As long as you ain't quitting crazy guys
that waits in an alley with a baseball

2529
02:17:44,941 --> 02:17:46,470
bat afterwards, hey,
you mother fucker. No,

2530
02:17:46,471 --> 02:17:50,220
I'm going to get the big payback going
to take your ass. Kickings I'm, I'm,

2531
02:17:50,221 --> 02:17:54,600
I'm very important. Firmly
believe you just have to be,
if you're mentally strong,

2532
02:17:54,630 --> 02:17:57,300
you can get through things. And I know
it helps. Not that simple, but yeah,

2533
02:17:57,301 --> 02:17:59,620
you're right. It's not that
simple, but it helps. It certainly,

2534
02:17:59,621 --> 02:18:02,940
it's a stay committed to whatever you're
doing. It's an honorable attribute.

2535
02:18:02,941 --> 02:18:06,030
It's a, it's a very, uh, attractive
attribute to, it's why a,

2536
02:18:06,110 --> 02:18:09,300
these stories that you've told today
were so much fun. Cause uh, you know,

2537
02:18:09,301 --> 02:18:13,560
everybody likes to hear a story about
a guy who was falling apart and the guy

2538
02:18:13,561 --> 02:18:17,150
who gotten to an unimaginable
situation you're getting, you know,

2539
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:21,150
a bookie is beating you up and you
owe $40,000 fee. It's craziness.

2540
02:18:21,151 --> 02:18:25,410
Seems craziness, but you can get
there really quick. Oh, I believe you.

2541
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:28,650
But I think that's what's admirable
about it, about your story

2542
02:18:29,510 --> 02:18:31,430
from a bad home. All my bad days, all my,

2543
02:18:32,090 --> 02:18:34,430
all the bad things in my life
came by personal choices.

2544
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:38,870
Like I had a great family.
Not mean nothing bad should happen to me.

2545
02:18:38,900 --> 02:18:41,440
I had all the chances in the world.
I just made a few bad.

2546
02:18:41,790 --> 02:18:45,770
Well it sounds like the college thing
going to casinos would set you off. Right.

2547
02:18:45,771 --> 02:18:48,380
That's what started it all.
Just really dug it. Man.

2548
02:18:48,750 --> 02:18:51,170
I don't think anything's wrong with
gambling and you can control it.

2549
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:53,180
How far did it go?
I mean,

2550
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:56,840
how long were you gambling before you
completely out of control? Years too fine.

2551
02:18:56,870 --> 02:19:01,160
For years. I wasn't fine. I was getting
there when I, when it helps me. Yeah.

2552
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:02,680
I mean Gross,

2553
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:06,290
cause I've talked to people and these
are like people who were alcoholics and

2554
02:19:06,291 --> 02:19:08,000
they make alcoholism sound like,

2555
02:19:08,001 --> 02:19:12,950
it's like you got curse by a demon and
there's some sort of full force inside

2556
02:19:12,951 --> 02:19:16,100
you. But no, my friend actually
said this to me. He said you,

2557
02:19:16,101 --> 02:19:20,180
what you don't understand is that even
when you're not using the addiction still

2558
02:19:20,181 --> 02:19:23,060
grow. God. Yeah, I would think about
it all the time. The addiction grows.

2559
02:19:23,090 --> 02:19:23,691
Absolutely.

2560
02:19:23,691 --> 02:19:28,100
So you feel like your addiction
is stronger now than it was when

2561
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:32,780
you were even gambling? It's
grown. I think I'm coming off,

2562
02:19:32,781 --> 02:19:37,550
I'm addicted to new things.
Might my addiction to other
things is very strong. So,

2563
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:40,190
but in your case, and I had never, Emily,

2564
02:19:40,490 --> 02:19:43,450
you don't have that same addiction to
Gaelic. It's not, it's not know if I,

2565
02:19:43,451 --> 02:19:45,410
I mean I have a feeling if
I was at a table I'd, I'd,

2566
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:50,270
I'd have a real hard time not doing it.
So his, his, his explanation of it though,

2567
02:19:50,271 --> 02:19:53,990
which was so hard for me to wrap my
head around was that this addiction is a

2568
02:19:53,991 --> 02:19:58,970
disease and that the disease
is unstoppable and then
all you could do is sort of

2569
02:19:58,971 --> 02:20:01,580
manage your life and all your,
you're never cured.

2570
02:20:01,850 --> 02:20:06,200
You're always just hovering. I would
say you're always recovering. Yes,

2571
02:20:06,380 --> 02:20:07,020
absolutely.

2572
02:20:07,020 --> 02:20:10,920
I do believe that. But you can,
there's levels of that and you can,

2573
02:20:11,010 --> 02:20:13,110
it doesn't mean your life
has to be horrible. I mean,

2574
02:20:13,111 --> 02:20:15,030
anyone that's listening
and your life is Shit, man.

2575
02:20:15,300 --> 02:20:17,910
You can make some choices to change.
It doesn't mean it can be perfect.

2576
02:20:17,911 --> 02:20:19,710
Your life's never gonna be perfect.
We tell the hoarders like,

2577
02:20:20,150 --> 02:20:22,030
don't try to think that
your life is gonna.

2578
02:20:22,050 --> 02:20:24,150
All of a sudden you're going to be cured
in a year and your life's going to be

2579
02:20:24,151 --> 02:20:27,060
great. You've got to really
set your expectations, and if,

2580
02:20:27,130 --> 02:20:31,620
if for a hoarder that's had 40,000
pounds of shit in their life, literally,

2581
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:37,280
if you can just keep a couple rooms clean
and actually show up and go to work,

2582
02:20:37,950 --> 02:20:41,040
that's success for you. You've got
to really set your expectations.

2583
02:20:41,041 --> 02:20:43,470
You're never going to have a perfect
easy life like you see on TV.

2584
02:20:43,471 --> 02:20:46,290
That's not realistic. But so for a lot
of these guys that are addicts out there,

2585
02:20:46,291 --> 02:20:48,840
I mean your life may not
be perfect ever again,

2586
02:20:48,841 --> 02:20:51,750
but it can be better than it is right
now and you've got to make some decisions

2587
02:20:51,751 --> 02:20:55,380
and make a plan and, and get
it set in. And it's never
easy. It doesn't take a day.

2588
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:58,340
Well Dude, I didn't expect
this part of the conversation.

2589
02:20:58,341 --> 02:21:01,520
I thought we were just going. That's all
right. No, no, it was great. It's not,

2590
02:21:01,521 --> 02:21:02,930
not though it was Nora,
it was great.

2591
02:21:03,140 --> 02:21:05,960
I think it was a very inspirational
for people. Like I said,

2592
02:21:05,961 --> 02:21:09,140
people love hearing people
figuring things out.

2593
02:21:09,141 --> 02:21:12,890
They love that they love people.
And I think it's especially,

2594
02:21:13,220 --> 02:21:15,680
it's especially important rather,
um,

2595
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:20,630
for you in your job because you come to
them and you come to these crazy people

2596
02:21:20,631 --> 02:21:24,650
with this perspective. But I understand
how this can go completely wrong.

2597
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:28,370
I understand. And I have been, and
you say, yeah, you've been worse.

2598
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:30,620
And that's amazing. That's
an a, that's a really a,

2599
02:21:30,621 --> 02:21:33,500
that's a really cool situation man.
You're the perfect guy for that job, man.

2600
02:21:33,501 --> 02:21:35,310
Thank you. I'm lucky he's doing
them. I got a great job, man.

2601
02:21:35,311 --> 02:21:38,000
This was a great conversation. It was a
lot of fun and really interesting stuff.

2602
02:21:38,030 --> 02:21:41,000
Huge Fan. Honored to be here.
Now you don't want to, I'm
a huge fan as well, man.

2603
02:21:41,001 --> 02:21:43,340
Especially now. And what is,
what is your podcast again?

2604
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:48,230
I can get it five decisions away. Go on
iTunes or five decisions away.com. What a,

2605
02:21:48,231 --> 02:21:49,710
is it,
what category is it on a Tortilla.

2606
02:21:50,710 --> 02:21:52,820
There it is right there.
We are TV and entertainment.

2607
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:54,810
So it turns out it's actually,
it's pretty good.

2608
02:21:54,970 --> 02:21:59,750
Presently. It's uh, for non iTunes
users you have for not iTunes users.

2609
02:21:59,800 --> 02:22:03,370
I'm not a, I'm on a Mac guy and
an apple guy. Oh, it's not. I do,

2610
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:06,090
I do all this shit myself. So
no, I mean, no, I mean like,

2611
02:22:08,930 --> 02:22:12,460
but you don't, you know, like Max, I
just never, I never committed to it.

2612
02:22:12,790 --> 02:22:16,150
You've ever still hanging on? Yeah, I own
a business still. I mean, some still PC.

2613
02:22:16,450 --> 02:22:21,280
How many viruses to get out of five a
day for? Oh, sure. I mean, good Lord.

2614
02:22:21,310 --> 02:22:24,090
Do you really get a lot of fires? A
lot. Yeah. I mean, porn you get by,

2615
02:22:24,810 --> 02:22:28,470
you addicted to porn as well. I enjoy
it. I'm not gonna lie. I'm married.

2616
02:22:28,830 --> 02:22:31,860
I am married. I mean, it's a
lot easier. Yeah, we should.

2617
02:22:32,180 --> 02:22:35,250
We should have got your flashlight
spank wider. Could you bring one home?

2618
02:22:35,251 --> 02:22:38,070
Where would you get in trouble? I don't
need that. You don't need so much effort.

2619
02:22:38,570 --> 02:22:42,300
Which effort at, I'm two minutes in out.
I'm done. Really? I mean, I work a lot.

2620
02:22:42,301 --> 02:22:46,710
I need to be in bed, man. You just give me
two minutes. Thank you. My Buddy's wife,

2621
02:22:46,711 --> 02:22:50,550
I'm at time. Think of your
fathers. You have a buddy Wayne,

2622
02:22:50,551 --> 02:22:52,620
a conversation about that.
Then the night someone was like,

2623
02:22:52,621 --> 02:22:56,610
have you ever masturbated to your wife?
And everybody in the room was like, no,

2624
02:22:57,330 --> 02:23:00,380
never thought about my actual
home life. Right. Well,

2625
02:23:00,390 --> 02:23:03,690
someone else about your buddy's wife
always. We always, I mean, we always say,

2626
02:23:03,691 --> 02:23:05,140
who do you, who do you, who's your,

2627
02:23:05,170 --> 02:23:08,250
we call it the closer he's show up with
the clothes are on TV ads and we always

2628
02:23:08,251 --> 02:23:11,760
call each other's wives. The closer
real cause that you can't do it, man.

2629
02:23:11,761 --> 02:23:13,020
That's the close to someone else.

2630
02:23:13,690 --> 02:23:16,130
So you're being honest about
jerking off to each other's wives.

2631
02:23:16,430 --> 02:23:18,810
You're off to your wife as well.
I'm sure he does my wife's side.

2632
02:23:18,811 --> 02:23:23,420
But it doesn't tell you this,
you're, you're just putting
it in his face. My wife,

2633
02:23:23,730 --> 02:23:26,700
his wife taught, but it doesn't, I'm
not gonna. It's not gonna achievement.

2634
02:23:26,701 --> 02:23:28,360
If I'm thinking of my wife,
I got to have someone else.

2635
02:23:28,390 --> 02:23:32,810
We tried to set up your wife's,
now it's too much work. That's not,

2636
02:23:33,650 --> 02:23:38,610
I dunno, I'm old school. I love my wife.
I love being married. It's a good thing.

2637
02:23:38,611 --> 02:23:42,060
I love being a dad. It's fun. But you
know, you gotta do what you gotta do.

2638
02:23:42,061 --> 02:23:43,200
And I think you have a,
a,

2639
02:23:43,430 --> 02:23:47,880
you definitely have a certain happiness
from knowing the darkest sides of your

2640
02:23:47,881 --> 02:23:50,370
personality and what you're capable
of getting yourself to life.

2641
02:23:50,371 --> 02:23:53,400
I never thought I'd have. This is so
cool, so I would never want to fuck it up.

2642
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:54,930
That's beautiful man.
Listen man,

2643
02:23:54,990 --> 02:23:57,840
you're a great guy and thank you very
much for coming here as a lot of fun.

2644
02:23:57,841 --> 02:24:01,180
I really, really appreciate it. Anytime
you ever want to come back. Well don't,

2645
02:24:01,181 --> 02:24:04,520
don't offer the outcome you're, you're
on. Come on, I'm operating anytime.

2646

Um, and there's an APP.
There's an APP. Oh Atlanta.

2651
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:23,040
The tickets are on sale
for the second show. Yes.

2652
02:24:23,041 --> 02:24:27,240
I am filming my DVD on April
20th like a true stoner,

2653
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:31,080
cause it was four 20. I couldn't
pass it. Plus it was Atlanta.

2654
02:24:31,081 --> 02:24:34,740
I have been in Atlanta a long time and
I had the opportunity to play at this

2655
02:24:34,741 --> 02:24:38,100
place called the Tabernacle,
which is just amazing theater in Atlanta.

2656
02:24:38,310 --> 02:24:42,150
It's going to be me, Joey Diaz and Duncan
Trussell. The first show is sold out,

2657
02:24:42,151 --> 02:24:44,520
but we just released
tickets for a second show.

2658
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:48,870
It's going to be a 10 30 we're filming
during bolts show so don't worry about it.

2659
02:24:48,871 --> 02:24:51,330
Like don't say fuck like a lot of people
got mad already have tickets to the

2660
02:24:51,331 --> 02:24:54,750
eight shoulders. This is bullshit. We're
filling the eight o'clock show too.

2661
02:24:55,050 --> 02:24:58,950
Don't worry about it. We're going to have
a great fucking time again. Joey Diaz,

2662
02:24:59,010 --> 02:25:02,340
Brian red bands coming. Dunkin trust
is going to be there. Little Hobo.

2663
02:25:02,341 --> 02:25:05,610
Will it be there as well? And I will
be releasing this on the Internet.

2664
02:25:05,611 --> 02:25:09,150
Louis C K style for five bucks.
The easiest way to do it.

2665
02:25:09,650 --> 02:25:11,940
Louis changed the game.
It's a game changer bitches.

2666
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:15,520
That is the end of our four podcasts in
a row week. Brian, how are you feeling?

2667
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:18,900
You want to get something to eat?
I'm starving. We get some yum, yum.

2668
02:25:19,470 --> 02:25:20,400
Thank you everybody.

2669
02:25:20,430 --> 02:25:24,100
Thank you for being the coolest fucking
audience members in the world. We,

2670
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:25,510
you know,
everywhere we go,

2671
02:25:25,540 --> 02:25:29,950
we are constantly being told how
generous the fans of the podcast are,

2672
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:33,910
how cool people are and how nice
and what a pleasure it is to wait.

2673
02:25:33,911 --> 02:25:36,760
Any guys in that means the world to me.
I just want to say thank you.

2674
02:25:36,761 --> 02:25:40,300
Thank you very much for that. Um, next
weekend I met the comedy and Magic Club.

2675

The weekend after that I

2677
02:25:45,731 --> 02:25:49,120

2678
02:25:49,121 --> 02:25:50,450
It's an 85 seat room.

2679
02:25:50,451 --> 02:25:54,400
It shit sells out quickly and it's going
