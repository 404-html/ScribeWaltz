1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,220
If it wasn't for Thanksgiving,

3
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:06,960
would anybody give a fuck about Turkey

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,360
country?

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,130
Hold Hunter?

6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:10,680
No.

7
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,240
Nobody likes to eat Turkey.

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:12,571
I mean,

9
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:13,410
it's good,

10
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,303
but it's not the best.

11
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,140
Not cheap grain is better than Turkey.

12
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,003
Can we agree?

13
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:17,611
Yeah.

14
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:19,290
There's no Kentucky Fried Turkey.

15
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:21,750
Yeah.

16
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,380
There's no Turkey stores now.

17
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,151
Chicken stores ever.

18
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,440
There's Popeye's chicken,

19
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,470
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

20
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,183
Bernays,

21
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,260
bernays Turkey Bacon for breakfast.

22
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,890
Is is completely an invention
of this advertising guy?

23
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,770
Yeah.

24
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,010
He was hired by the company.

25
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:42,390
I forget the name of the company,

26
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:46,440
but they're still around in some form
that hired him to sell more pork.

27
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,200
And so he came up with this
idea like bacon and eggs.

28
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,160
What's for breakfast?

29
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:52,880
You got to like integrate it
into the cultural traditions.

30
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:53,460
Wow.

31
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,730
And ever since then it's been
considered breakfast meat and boom.

32
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,050
Meanwhile it's awesome.

33
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,310
So congratulations.

34
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:04,311
So he was also behind the fluoridation
of the water supply hired by Alcoa

35
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,150
because they had all this,

36
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,060
all this.

37
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,080
I'm a byproduct of making aluminum,

38
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,370
which is this fluoride.

39
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,540
And they wanted to like,

40
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,890
what are we going to
do with all this stuff?

41
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:14,071
You know,

42
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:15,120
we gotta find a way to sell it.

43
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:15,901
Who could we sell it to?

44
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:16,890
And he figured out like,

45
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:17,041
Oh,

46
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:17,341
we can,

47
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:17,611
you know,

48
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,690
it's good for dental.

49
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:21,300
It'll save everyone and get
the government to buy it.

50
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,201
It's so funny.

51
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:25,800
We accept that man because like if someone
comes over to your house and you're

52
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:26,260
like,

53
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,300
and you want some water,

54
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:27,691
and they're like,

55
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:27,931
yeah.

56
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:28,764
And you're like,

57
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,480
do you want me to add some fluoride to it?

58
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,040
I'd be like,

59
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,030
fuck yeah,

60
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:34,330
it is a chemical that kills you.

61
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:35,164
So yeah.

62
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,160
Could you put fluoride
in your ad can kill you.

63
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,470
It doesn't take a whole lot.

64
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,820
Like how much kills you?

65
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:43,110
Like a couple of teaspoons full.

66
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:43,890
I don't know.

67
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,200
I have no die with white teeth.

68
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,400
But is that real?

69
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,300
What's going on with
dental hygiene versus.

70
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,890
I mean,

71
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,560
is it Florida in the water that makes a
difference or being conscious of dental

72
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:55,860
hygiene,

73
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,730
dental hygiene.

74
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,040
It's made the difference
in tooth decay and people.

75
00:01:59,041 --> 00:01:59,461
Well,

76
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:00,810
I mean talking to take,

77
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,230
you know,

78
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,041
you talking to me,

79
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,720
I'm always going to take
it back to foragers.

80
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,310
Foragers have amazing teeth.

81
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,650
Roots and shit though.

82
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:07,860
Well,

83
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,690
some sand in a Weston Smith.

84
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,590
What is this?

85
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,100
We put in this.

86
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,311
Oh,

87
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,270
this is bernays.

88
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,760
Said that get the Bacon for breakfast and
he is also responsible for fluoride in

89
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:21,594
the water

90
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,653
for Dixie Cup.

91
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,450
Jamie is just like Dixie Cup show
and then I'm not full of Shit.

92
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,051
I love it.

93
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:28,760
Jamie.

94
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,000
Thinking that they were
drinking out of unsafe.

95
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,580
What?

96
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,330
Look at this,

97
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,900
his campaign for Dixie Cups.

98
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:38,000
Scared people into thinking that
glasses they were drinking out of where?

99
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,950
Unsanitary and can be
replaced by disposable cups.

100
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:41,970
Wow.

101
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,201
Did you read this before?

102
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:43,681
You put it up.

103
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:44,610
That's insane.

104
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,550
And it was the beach nut
packing company that's hired.

105
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,880
This guy was amazing,

106
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:52,560
but the bake and he got it right.

107
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,250
Oh he got.

108
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,083
He got everything right.

109
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,470
Dead on with the Bacon.

110
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,240
Bacon.

111
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,010
He also was behind the
Virginia slims thing.

112
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,441
Oh,

113
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:02,800
how can we use feminism to
get women to buy cigarettes?

114
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,360
It's a feminist cigarette.

115
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,291
Come a long way,

116
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:05,890
baby.

117
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,750
I bet that guy got laid like crazy.

118
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,420
I bet he was just a fucking maestro.

119
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,810
And he was Freud's nephew.

120
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,891
Oh my goodness.

121
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,820
So he had the benefit of psychological
examination under his uncle.

122
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,510
He's proud of himself like he doesn't.

123
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,320
He just died like 10 years ago.

124
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:21,911
He's like,

125
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:22,071
yeah,

126
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:23,140
I did all this shit,

127
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,480
but he's happy.

128
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,290
His success ratio was amazing,

129
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:26,560
right?

130
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:26,711
Oh,

131
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:28,330
he hit every one out of the park.

132
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,370
I've said there's more,

133
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,271
and I really mean this.

134
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:36,271
There is more intellectual debate in
one hour of twitter than there is a four

135
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,264
years of college.

136
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,200
I mean there's far more conflict of ideas
on social media now than there isn't a

137
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:47,380
college classroom because college
classrooms are dominated and have been for

138
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:49,720
decades by left liberals.

139
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,700
That's the discourse
that goes on in there.

140
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,410
You don't hear conservative ideas,

141
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,940
you don't hear libertarian ideas,

142
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,120
you don't even hear some
radical left wing ideas.

143
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,270
It's this very narrow discourse that is
pretty much only allowed in the college

144
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,230
classroom and that's to me the most.

145
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,420
The biggest problem with
the modern university,

146
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,580
there is no diversity of ideas.

147
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,620
Everybody's obsessed
with diversity of color,

148
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,933
skin color,

149
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,090
but no one cares about a diversity.

150
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,830
Diversity of ideas about real debate.

151
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,920
I want in my university to have
a real debate about big ideas.

152
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:31,690
I want the best minds from conservatism
and liberalism and socialism and

153
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:34,750
libertarianism to have it out to.

154
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:39,130
Let's talk about the big ideas and
let's go for it and have the best people

155
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,950
argue the points on their
merits against each other.

156
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,730
Why is it that there's such a narrow
path of ideas that exist right now in

157
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:53,590
college is why is it just
this tenure track tenure?

158
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,100
Yeah.

159
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,461
I mean,

160
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:59,461
so what happened was conservatives
basically dominated colleges until the 19

161
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:04,621
sixties and then the 19 sixties generation
of radicals had nowhere to go when

162
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,810
they went into their
twenties and thirties,

163
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,210
so they decided to move into the academy,

164
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:13,690
so they all got phds and they became
professors and they've dominated ever

165
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:14,524
since.

166
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,010
There's also the system
of tenure in universities,

167
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:20,110
which is supposed to
protect academic freedom,

168
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,710
and what it actually does is it
enforces intellectual conformity,

169
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,610
right?

170
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,150
Because you have a lifetime appointment
and you and you control hiring,

171
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,020
right?

172
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,430
The faculty controls hiring.

173
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,230
Who?

174
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,380
Who are you going to hire?

175
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,000
You're going to hire
somebody who agrees with you.

176
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,980
Who says what you think should be said?

177
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,890
So that's the problem with tenure,

178
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,090
right?

179
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,770
It sort of protects academic freedom,

180
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:45,040
but mostly it enforces
intellectual conformity.

181
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,860
That's disturbing.

182
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,100
It's disturbing because
you see it's a priesthood.

183
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,730
Yeah.

184
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,230
In a way.

185
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,590
Right?

186
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,030
Right.

187
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,220
You're,

188
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,430
you're a priest for life.

189
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,920
And who are you going to
recruit into the priesthood.

190
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,040
A true

191
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,873
believer.

192
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,580
That's what goes on in universities.

193
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,940
You know why they didn't go to that?

194
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:03,230
Why?

195
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,130
Why is it not go that way?

196
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:08,910
Because I would have gone off on
him that he would have beat up Jack,

197
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,650
right?

198
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,680
Luke and the one that would
be in that room that night.

199
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:16,100
I know how to motivate
Cubans or with religion,

200
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,680
that radicals you would do.

201
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:19,940
You would just start talking about God,

202
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,730
I just told them about.

203
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:20,910
Oh,

204
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,130
goon got metal,

205
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:22,970
God of Cuba,

206
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:23,540
and he looked at,

207
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,110
wait a minute,

208
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,230
hold on a to go.

209
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,770
And he used the one that he.

210
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,661
The metal worker.

211
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:30,890
He's the fucking built.

212
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,630
And when you go on Youtube,

213
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:32,820
look,

214
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,490
throat ghoulies is always a big yield.

215
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,490
Black Guy lives in the
jungle and he only comes out.

216
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,430
The only comes out when there's a problem,

217
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,910
so if I would've seen
Yoel Romero that day,

218
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:45,630
I would have said Google
and I would have got a gun.

219
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,740
Like God love going,

220
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,010
Shit Dog.

221
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:52,310
I started doing that to end this and
silver when I first met him and I remember

222
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,620
one day in the hallway he
couldn't take his eyes off of me.

223
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,020
People talking to him.

224
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:56,854
They kept looking back,

225
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,280
fuck the sand because
it's big in Brasilia,

226
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,143
Brasilia Brazilian.

227
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,470
So I would've started saying,

228
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,343
oh Whoa,

229
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,690
oh yeah.

230
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,140
Or,

231
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,900
and then I would have started
saying who my mother is whole lot.

232
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,290
You see my periodic golden eat that leg

233
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,340
after I bought good to look.

234
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,320
That's the dude.

235
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,430
That's your marrow.

236
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,493
Look it up.

237
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,410
You know all black muscular Cuban
dudes that looked like that.

238
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,090
You fire them up,

239
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:31,160
tell them they're old and they go,

240
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,820
shit,

241
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,970
I'll get you fired up at all before.

242
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,070
This is huge in Cuba.

243
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,940
It was this guy,

244
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,910
this guy right here,

245
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,190
he.

246
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,640
So there's like a series
of black porn films.

247
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,440
These guys shirtless,

248
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,600
six pack covered in oil.

249
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,320
This is the price of the jungle.

250
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,520
And he is in charge of machinery when you,

251
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,690
when machinery goes
bad and shit like that,

252
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:00,590
you have to pray to him.

253
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,630
He has all the weapons of metal.

254
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:04,210
He just shows up in metal and stuff.

255
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,090
He has a metal,

256
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,880
acts metal,

257
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,260
fucking everything that.

258
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,060
So that's what I would have busted
him with that I would've just.

259
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,440
I would've gotten through
his head without going.

260
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,641
I hate that.

261
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:14,240
That takes over Jesus and Cuba.

262
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:15,290
That's what you were brought up on.

263
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,640
You heard that grown up.

264
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,550
So even if you converted
to Christianity later on,

265
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,590
that will still get under your skin,

266
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:25,520
like your cage and shit profile
to stop saying that shit.

267
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,040
Everybody I there,

268
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,530
right?

269
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,700
John Mccarthy?

270
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,840
It would have been an episode of curly
and the little rascals when they fund

271
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:34,040
that little rascal three stooges,

272
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,380
they want to currently
wrestle for a benefit.

273
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,190
But the problem was whenever
curly smelled wild license,

274
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,630
she went fucking nuts.

275
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,290
So he's on the bottom of the pile.

276
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,820
The guys beating them and all of a sudden
what comes over and makes them sniff

277
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:49,320
the fucking thing
currently pushes him off.

278
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,211
What is it called?

279
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:51,044
Wild Heisei,

280
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,010
wild hyacinth like some
fucking something you,

281
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:55,630
you know,

282
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,630
this is like in the forties it was made
and all of a sudden you flashback and

283
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:01,860
you just see curly,

284
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,330
everybody,

285
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,700
people coming up and then
he gets a little bit belt.

286
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,150
At least starts clocking people with
the bell from the wild licensed and they

287
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:11,620
flip over the curly hitting
people with the Bow Austin,

288
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,490
they flip over to the middle of the ring
and they're all piled on top of each

289
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:17,550
other though 18 people with that fucking.

290
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,560
That's what I would have done
through the yellow metal that day.

291
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,680
He would've gotten until the Orleans Bang.

292
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:23,810
Your head was fucking.

293
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,463
What's his name?

294
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,570
Goldberg.
