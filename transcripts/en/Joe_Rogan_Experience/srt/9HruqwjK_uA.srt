Joe rogan experience by day Joe
Rogan podcast by night all day,

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,020
and we're alive.

3
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,240
You,

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,280
you're one of those dudes
that rocks two phones.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:19,481
No,

6
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:19,610
no,

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:19,731
no.

8
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:20,810
This is an iPod touch.

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,670
This phone is broken.

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,670
So like I can't listen to
music on this phone anymore,

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,840
so I just bought an iPod touch.

12
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:27,740
I'm not that dude,

13
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:28,670
that dude.

14
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:28,871
No,

15
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:29,690
this is just,

16
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,580
it looks like them that like,

17
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,700
like this is my burner.

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,091
But no,

19
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:32,924
it's just,

20
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,830
well,

21
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,830
there's a lot of people that just love
fucking around with a bunch of different

22
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:39,080
pieces of electronics and a few of them.

23
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:39,291
No,

24
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,190
I prefer one.

25
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,440
It's just when I went
to this Verizon to go,

26
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:43,171
can I have a new phone?

27
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:43,761
So this was cracked.

28
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:44,060
They were like,

29
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,241
okay,

30
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:45,260
that'll be $700.

31
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:45,591
And I was like,

32
00:00:45,591 --> 00:00:45,771
no,

33
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:46,604
it won't be.

34
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,740
I will wait until my contract is up.

35
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,400
What's wrong with it?

36
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:49,941
It's cracked.

37
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:50,661
The screen is cracked,

38
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:51,321
which doesn't bother me,

39
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:52,070
but somehow it,

40
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,260
I,

41
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,180
I'm really bad with,

42
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:55,340
I'm really hard on everything
as my wife will attest.

43
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,060
And uh,

44
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,050
oh yeah.

45
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:57,711
Not at all.

46
00:00:57,711 --> 00:00:58,341
Not In a ray rice.

47
00:00:58,341 --> 00:00:58,551
Wait,

48
00:00:58,551 --> 00:00:59,384
let's be clear.

49
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,433
But uh,

50
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,360
the Jack is all fucked up so I can't,

51
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,800
I can't hear things in anymore.

52
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,071
You know,

53
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:06,260
ray rice way will be a statement.

54
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,640
Yeah,

55
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:07,881
no.

56
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:08,151
Yeah.

57
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,810
You until somebody else knocks two of
their wives out in an elevator like

58
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,610
Michael Vick,

59
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,260
your dog.

60
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,670
Yeah.

61
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,881
Yeah.

62
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:14,660
That's uh,

63
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:14,931
yeah,

64
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:15,620
that was,

65
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,620
that whole scenario is leading to so
many different people getting in trouble

66
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:24,410
for domestic violence and
reports of divesting violence.

67
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,353
Man,

68
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,390
Anthony Johnson,

69
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,950
one of the fighters in the UFC,

70
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,890
God suspended just because
there was just the,

71
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,110
the possibility that may
be something happened.

72
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:35,270
So there's an inquiry.

73
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:37,460
I mean we're going through
a sea change right now.

74
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,300
Yeah.

75
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,991
And it's all about,

76
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:41,840
I think because I have talked
about this a little bit before,

77
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:45,590
that it used to be you only knew the
shit that you knew that was directly in

78
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:46,041
front of you,

79
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,610
that you want information you sought
out or your friends brought to you.

80
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,410
But now on Facebook and Twitter,

81
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,630
people are like finding of
a ray rice who were like,

82
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,490
I didn't know there was
a thing called the NFL,

83
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,383
you know what I mean?

84
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,280
Like everybody's getting everybody
shit so that the NFL has had domestic

85
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,060
violence for,

86
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,331
you know,

87
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,650
since the dawn of the NFL.

88
00:02:03,651 --> 00:02:06,290
And not that it's any
worse than regular society,

89
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,124
but they've had it.

90
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,650
But now it's to the point where people
who never were paying attention to the

91
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:11,030
NFL are noticing it.

92
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,360
Also people are going and looking through
the past of a lot of these different

93
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:17,010
guys.

94
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,620
Yeah.

95
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,500
I think whenever you're dealing with a
bunch of like super athletes who are also

96
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:26,240
involved in an incredibly aggressive
sport and you add in head trauma.

97
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,750
Yes.

98
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,780
Repeated head trauma and a lot of them,

99
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:33,110
like ray rice has said that
that's how he was raised or that,

100
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:33,250
uh,

101
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:33,471
no,

102
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:35,450
he wouldn't say it was
a Peterson Peterson.

103
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:38,000
Adrian Peterson said
that's how he was raised.

104
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:41,330
When you repeat getting knocked
the fuck out the elevator.

105
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:42,164
Yeah.

106
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,920
Ray Rice Peterson.

107
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,271
Yeah.

108
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:44,511
I mean,

109
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:44,661
I,

110
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:45,350
I've,

111
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,660
I've pulled the switch off a
tree because I had to go get one,

112
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,021
but,

113
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:48,500
uh,

114
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,910
I didn't have my nuts all cut up.

115
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:50,091
Like,

116
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:51,150
I think there's dead nuts.

117
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,131
That was the kid.

118
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:52,970
It was like that.

119
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:53,540
There was,

120
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,171
there's a,

121
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:58,670
from what I read that there was actual
like injuries on his genital area.

122
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,320
Really.

123
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,070
That's what I'd like,

124
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,281
you know,

125
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,810
I'm not trying to testify
in a court of law,

126
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:02,710
but I heard that it was like,

127
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,390
I mean there's certainly,

128
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,440
there's abuse and there's,

129
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:08,410
and there's also discipline and
we all that line is changing.

130
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:08,721
Like I said,

131
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,020
they were going through a sea change
where everybody knows everybody shit now.

132
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:11,861
But,

133
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:12,520
uh,

134
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:12,880
I don't,

135
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,720
I don't think you can hide,

136
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,990
but we all had fucked up shit had
to happen to us by our parents.

137
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,570
But does mean you have to pass it on to
the next know you don't got to pay it

138
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:20,080
forward.

139
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,381
Fuck.

140
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:20,770
Yeah.

141
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,041
Yeah,

142
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:21,821
that's a good point.

143
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:22,421
And I,

144
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:25,660
I've been talking about it lately that
my parents were raised by immigrants,

145
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,880
immigrants that came over
from Italy and Ireland.

146
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,960
And you know those people that came over
here in the 1920s they were savages.

147
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,330
They might as well been cave people,

148
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,020
right.

149
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,970
They got on these shitty boats.

150
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,610
It floated across the ocean,

151
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,221
took months.

152
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:40,054
They got over here,

153
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,930
they got their name change right away
and immediately they started fucking and

154
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,161
shit.

155
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:46,480
Now kids and then they raise those
kids with their savage instincts in the

156
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,480
neighborhood that they're not allowed
to leave because they have their accent

157
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:51,220
was too thick and the weird food,

158
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,850
I'll have to leave that neighborhood
at the point where Italians weren't

159
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:55,684
considered to be white.

160
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,440
People aren't white or you know,

161
00:03:57,441 --> 00:04:00,010
it was like Polish people are white
and then eventually they lose.

162
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:02,830
The accents are allowed to integrate
into the rest of the of the city.

163
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,690
I had a history professor on yesterday,

164
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:07,330
Thaddeus Russell who explained
that exact same thing.

165
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,020
You know how all these different cultures
integrate into society and they're

166
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:12,330
considered non whites.

167
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,900
Yeah.

168
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,711
For the black folks.

169
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:17,980
Yeah.

170
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,970
We don't get the integrated.

171
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,710
While it was also his,

172
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:23,000
his take on it was the unique uh,

173
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,790
aspect of America is that America was the,

174
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,290
the country that had this
puritan value system.

175
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:36,490
Like these people came over and he had
this like really re repressive value

176
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:38,740
system and very repressed society,

177
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,310
but they also had slaves
and the slaves didn't,

178
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,440
they didn't accept any of that.

179
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,660
And then they became part of the culture.

180
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,880
Radically influenced the art radically
and for influenced the language.

181
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,743
Who the slaves,

182
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,540
the slaves did.

183
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:53,980
Yeah.

184
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,480
I mean this is one of the most unique
things about America is the African

185
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,480
American influence and the
western Africans integrating
into this really fucked

186
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:04,660
up puritan,

187
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,430
very repressed society.

188
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,920
And then you see in America,

189
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,580
like 90% of all entertainment
comes out of here.

190
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,050
Uh,

191
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,670
a massive amount of
innovation comes out of here.

192
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,870
A massive difference in the way we speak
English as opposed to the way English

193
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:20,770
people speak English.

194
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,010
It's so many variables
that that came out of that.

195
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,240
And it makes you think like how much of
it kind of bringing it all back to the

196
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:29,074
Peterson thing,

197
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,980
beaten as kids.

198
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,870
How much of the way human beings live our
lives is based just on the momentum of

199
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,950
the people that came before us,

200
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,160
whether it's his parents had been him or
some fucking weird puritanical society

201
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:44,230
that you just unluckily we're born into.

202
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:44,860
Yeah,

203
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,190
well there's,

204
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,341
yeah,

205
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:46,174
a lot of that is,

206
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,440
but again,

207
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,333
there's that,

208
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,480
I certainly understand that we,

209
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:49,770
you know,

210
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,160
like I said,

211
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,260
oh,

212
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,280
all this fucked up.

213
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:52,540
Things happened to us in our childhood.

214
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,621
Some of us go,

215
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:55,120
I got to put a stop to this.

216
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:55,391
I go,

217
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:55,721
you know,

218
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:56,950
that you make the choice to go,

219
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,430
I got to break the cycle.

220
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,870
And sometimes it's in big ways like,

221
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:00,710
I'm going to go to college.

222
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:01,461
Nobody went to college.

223
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,150
And sometimes it's like,

224
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,620
I'm not going to slap my kid in the nuts.

225
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:04,101
You know what I mean?

226
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:04,750
Like it just,

227
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,540
I'm going to stick.

228
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,470
I'm going to talk to him.

229
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:06,831
You know,

230
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:07,131
and I,

231
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:10,060
and certainly I was whooped
as a kid by different things.

232
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,430
I mean,

233
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,000
I always say my,

234
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,370
one of my grandmother's favorite stories
was to talk about how she beat me with

235
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:14,204
a shoe one time.

236
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,040
And that was thanksgiving.

237
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,500
Everybody sit down and let's hear
the beat with the shoe story.

238
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,110
That was not like a in therapy.

239
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:21,741
She told that story.

240
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:22,130
He's like,

241
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,641
hey grandma,

242
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:24,590
tell her how you beat me
with a shoe story again.

243
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:26,480
And everybody would laugh and you know,

244
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,250
and it was a good southern time.

245
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,680
What was the cause?

246
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,510
What did you do that made
her beat you in a shoe?

247
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,411
It's funny.

248
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:33,950
It's the south.

249
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,370
I said,

250
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,203
I said what?

251
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,140
That's it?

252
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,830
Yeah.

253
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,180
So like so uh,

254
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,141
so call me,

255
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:39,920
say come out.

256
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,570
Come out what you said.

257
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,500
Y'All say what to me so well boss.

258
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,651
Yes ma'am.

259
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:46,484
Yes ma'am.

260
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:46,990
Wow.

261
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,421
And I was,

262
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:48,254
and I lived in the,

263
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,900
I just say the north probably
with my mom in the north.

264
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:54,140
So I didn't know that wasn't a thing in
the north that you couldn't say what.

265
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,161
So I didn't know.

266
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:56,520
And I felt really like tricked,

267
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,470
like I felt in trap,

268
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,490
like nobody give me a list of rules of
how it works here in the south and I

269
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,420
won't do those things.

270
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:02,690
So she,

271
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,740
that's funny man.

272
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,603
That's funny.

273
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,900
I got beat with a shoe for saying what?

274
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,150
Well,

275
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,441
kids,

276
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:07,790
when they're starting to,

277
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:08,624
uh,

278
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,710
sort of find themselves when they're
starting to establish their own identity,

279
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:17,150
one of the first things they do is a
immediately try to challenge the way you

280
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,540
discipline them and the way you,

281
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,341
you like,

282
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:20,480
my daughter loves doing that.

283
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:20,870
I go,

284
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,111
you know,

285
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:21,681
I'll say to her,

286
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:21,861
hey,

287
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:22,221
come on,

288
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:22,960
we gotta go do something.

289
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,830
That's what she like.

290
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:25,664
Look at me.

291
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,860
I'm watching TV.

292
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,881
I know you want your TV,

293
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,630
but you got to eat.

294
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:29,990
Yeah.

295
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,680
It's time to eat.

296
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,220
You know,

297
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,170
I want to watch the show and it's not,

298
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:33,651
no.

299
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:34,860
I want to watch show there's no,

300
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,600
no,

301
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,381
we're not negotiating.

302
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:36,561
Yeah.

303
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,820
This is just what's going to happen.

304
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:38,863
He's going to get shut off.

305
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:40,460
Yeah.

306
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,293
No angry.

307
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,750
I would,

308
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,770
I stand by.

309
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:43,790
It wasn't that testing authority.

310
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,360
I just did.

311
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,193
I just didn't hear.

312
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,851
I'm sorry.

313
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:47,684
What?

314
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,753
Oh God,

315
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,160
it was entrapment was entrapment.

316
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:51,411
Yeah,

317
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:51,821
and button.

318
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:52,110
Then it,

319
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,580
and then it became every year
the story was told is like the,

320
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,000
the,

321
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,190
the bell holiday story.

322
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,640
That's so weird.

323
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:00,380
Then it fun to beat kids with shoes.

324
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,243
It was fun,

325
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,120
you know?

326
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,080
And I worked out pretty well,

327
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:03,630
I think.

328
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,460
Yeah.

329
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:04,761
Great.

330
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:05,594
But it didn't happen.

331
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,100
It didn't happen every day.

332
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:07,581
It wasn't a,

333
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:08,330
it wasn't like the,

334
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:08,901
here's my time,

335
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:09,470
we get beat,

336
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,950
but it certainly was the thing that I
remember and I'm not going to do that to

337
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:13,690
my daughter.

338
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,190
You know?

339
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:14,630
There's no,

340
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,310
there's no shoe beating
happening in my house.

341
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,203
Yeah.

342
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,343
Yeah.

343
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,190
It's,

344
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,000
it's sick.

345
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,391
When you,

346
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:21,320
when you see,

347
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,890
like I saw the pictures of just his
kid's leg that were beat with the switch.

348
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,910
It's a sick thing.

349
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,300
Yeah.

350
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,620
It's like beating a kid.

351
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,630
It's not the way to raise a kid.

352
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,320
Yeah.

353
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,190
Like I think there's,

354
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,480
there's that as a pinos apparent.

355
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,020
There's times when you do grab your key,

356
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:34,551
you might grab,

357
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:35,271
you can't cause you're like,

358
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:37,010
don't touch that or don't do that,

359
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:39,080
or you're going to get hurt and
I need to get your attention.

360
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,070
I mean,

361
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,731
my daughter's cool,

362
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:41,421
but if I yell,

363
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:41,871
she gets like,

364
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:42,500
you Yo,

365
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,333
good me.

366
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,240
And then I feel bad.

367
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:45,651
And I'm like,

368
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:46,041
man,

369
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,660
that's a different era.

370
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,563
Yeah.

371
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,191
Yeah.

372
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:50,240
We're raising babies.

373
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,093
Yeah.

374
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,400
Yeah.

375
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,031
It's a softer,

376
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:53,801
friendlier world.

377
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,230
Well we're getting to it is,

378
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:55,940
and I just,

379
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,680
uh,

380
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,630
I like that.

381
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,860
I liked that aspect of it.

382
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:01,980
I liked that we're becoming more
aware of the negative impact.

383
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:03,890
I mean if we didn't learn from the,

384
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:06,630
the fucked up shit that our
parents and grandparents did to us,

385
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,700
then we would really be idiots.

386
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:11,490
I mean the whole point
is that we're evolving.

387
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,181
We have to go,

388
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,580
they did that and I'm going to
try to do something one better.

389
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:18,570
And I think specifically the culture
of athletes is that if you're a

390
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,321
professional athlete,

391
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:23,250
you've probably been coddled since you
were in high school and been told and

392
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:25,350
you've been given a different
set of rules to live by.

393
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,950
So that somebody who
grew up with ray rice,

394
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:28,760
he maybe came out of seeing him.

395
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,550
It may not be doing the things he's doing
cause they work at fucking Walmart and

396
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:35,160
they're not allowed to tell people what
the fuck they think all the time and

397
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:36,210
then allowed to do those things.

398
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:40,020
But Ray rice as a professional athlete
as a star is living by a completely

399
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:40,860
different set of rules.

400
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,680
And what happens to a guy like
that and now he's kind of fucked.

401
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:45,960
I mean,

402
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,700
you know Michael Vick was
supposed to be fucked too.

403
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:49,890
I think if there America likes a comeback,

404
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,070
do you don't suppose nobody was more
fucked than Mike Tyson was when he,

405
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,440
when he was convicted for raping,

406
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:56,890
went to jail and he's sent,

407
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,601
seemed to come out of that.

408
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:57,991
Okay,

409
00:09:57,991 --> 00:09:59,100
America likes to come back.

410
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,880
That is true.

411
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,420
That is true.

412
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,390
If he does the things that allow him to,

413
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,931
you know what I mean?

414
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:04,650
Like if he,

415
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,240
like I always think about tiger woods.

416
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,810
America hasn't accepted him back because
they were unfortunately can't go to

417
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:11,280
jail for cheating on your wife.

418
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,760
Like if he could have gone to jail
and then like people are like,

419
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:14,971
oh,

420
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:17,910
he was in jail for 18 months right
now we'll let them come back.

421
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:18,421
But we're still,

422
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:20,070
people are still judging
him for what he did.

423
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:23,040
Could you imagine how happy women
would be if a guy could go to jail for

424
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:23,874
cheating on his wife?

425
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,150
And it was so excited.

426
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,590
They would be blogs written every day.

427
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,550
What were women would be recounting
stories from highschool asking their

428
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:34,560
boyfriends to be put back in jail.

429
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,320
Yeah.

430
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,671
The thing is,

431
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:36,870
it happened a decade ago.

432
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,111
Yes,

433
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:37,540
they would be,

434
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,580
their professional victim crusade
would be out in full force.

435
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,061
They had no,

436
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:42,301
there's,

437
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:42,751
and so,

438
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:43,351
but you can't,

439
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,310
since you can't do that,

440
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,080
tiger woods is still walking
around with his head down,

441
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:46,610
like going,

442
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,430
oh,

443
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,551
no,

444
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:48,384
sorry,

445
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,223
I was on an airplane.

446
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,100
It was really funny.

447
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,551
And,

448
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:50,760
uh,

449
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,700
there was this guy and his wife
and they were in front of us and,

450
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:54,480
um,

451
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:54,811
the,

452
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:55,260
uh,

453
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:00,210
the guy was going over the golf score
and the woman had like a golf a visor on.

454
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,770
So I guess they probably both played golf.

455
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,380
And the guy was going over
there and he goes like this.

456
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:04,651
He goes,

457
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:05,310
ah.

458
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:05,671
He goes,

459
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:06,240
uh,

460
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,781
tiger,

461
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:06,960
uh,

462
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,490
blew it in the whatever round.

463
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:09,201
I don't follow golf.

464
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,034
I don't know how it works.

465
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,973
And she goes,

466
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,000
of course he did.

467
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,710
What have you done lately?

468
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,940
Really shitting on tiger woods.

469
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,570
Golfers the fuck saying
has ever known you can't,

470
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,210
tiger unfortunately did
not go to jail for it.

471
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:29,460
So he can never really
recover from it unless he,

472
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,971
you know,

473
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:30,620
his wife,

474
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,120
if his wife had stayed with him
then they would have been like,

475
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:33,301
okay,

476
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:36,540
they worked it out because his
wife left him as I understand,

477
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,160
you know,

478
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,580
you get to like 1415 women,

479
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:38,800
you go,

480
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,130
I think this isn't working out and then,

481
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:41,940
but he can't,

482
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,400
there's no like there's no thing to do.

483
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:44,761
There was no,

484
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:47,280
it's not like even with Coby
where like the court case ended,

485
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:48,930
whether you believe it
ended to the right way,

486
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,250
it was at least resolved.

487
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:50,701
So there's was like,

488
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:50,891
no,

489
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:51,770
I can just play in Nike.

490
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:52,021
He's like,

491
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:52,231
okay,

492
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:53,380
well fuck with you now.

493
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,030
You know you can come back in the fold.

494
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,540
But,

495
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,420
and especially cause tiger is not
as good as he was before that,

496
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,730
which is really shocking.

497
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,450
I think that's,

498
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,410
I feel like it's mental.

499
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:03,590
I think it's totally like,

500
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,151
that's what I'm saying.

501
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:04,630
He didn't.

502
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,740
I think he knows and I mean,

503
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:06,760
I don't know tiger woods at all,

504
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:07,870
but I just feel like the thing,

505
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,250
I've been that guy where you're like,

506
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:10,750
I fucked up and there's no way to get out.

507
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,680
I just got to sit in my juices
for a while and hope it passes.

508
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,221
Well also,

509
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:19,300
I don't think either one of us could ever
understand what it's like to be a that

510
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:21,340
famous and be that hated.

511
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,910
Yes.

512
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,743
Yes.

513
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,810
And it started when you were 19 you know,

514
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,700
that's the thing to me about the
same as professional athletes.

515
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,020
You became famous before
your brain was for,

516
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,870
your fucking still has a soft spot,

517
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,733
you know?

518
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:33,970
Yeah.

519
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,803
We were all,

520
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,310
you were not a full grown.

521
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:37,150
You've already been full girl.

522
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:37,291
Yeah.

523
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,770
You didn't even have your man wait on you.

524
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:39,100
Yeah.

525
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,920
Shoulders yet,

526
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,590
you know,

527
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,730
and suddenly one of those
famous people on the planet.

528
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,500
I understand why on his side,

529
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:45,210
like,

530
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:45,930
you know,

531
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,970
as a kid who was a nerd and went to
Stanford and his calm and his dad has been

532
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:49,720
to play golf forever,

533
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,500
that he was like,

534
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,110
I think it was like to have
sex with lots of women.

535
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,560
I just never had that chance.

536
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:55,480
And I know I got married and
that was probably a dumb idea,

537
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,500
but I get that.

538
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,820
But then you can't,

539
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:58,654
uh,

540
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:58,991
you know,

541
00:12:58,991 --> 00:12:59,241
you,

542
00:12:59,241 --> 00:12:59,680
you,

543
00:12:59,680 --> 00:12:59,951
you know,

544
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:00,784
he got caught.

545
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:01,220
Well,

546
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,781
there's also,

547
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,940
I think this is just speculation,

548
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:08,440
but I think there's all of this
is [inaudible] with me as well.

549
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,550
There's,

550
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,760
there's a thing that goes along
with being a great athlete.

551
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,310
There's like this conquer mentality.

552
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,740
Like they can't be beaten.

553
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,723
I mean,

554
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,010
Muhammad Ali screaming,

555
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,660
I'm a greatest of all time.

556
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,890
When he did that,

557
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:25,060
everybody loved it.

558
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,923
They love it.

559
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,810
Half the people loved it and half
the people thought we need to.

560
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,170
Yeah.

561
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,830
We need to draft him into the military
and force him to be our bitch.

562
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,480
Yeah,

563
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,920
true.

564
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
And I don't mean try not to say that word,

565
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:36,311
but yes,

566
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:36,430
that's,

567
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:36,941
that's,

568
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,361
yeah.

569
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:37,991
You try not to say,

570
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:38,470
bitch,

571
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,200
I tried it.

572
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,670
I,

573
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,040
I'm,

574
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,873
I'm that guy.

575
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,520
Don't let them get you bro.

576
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,701
No,

577
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:45,100
it's not a bunch of female dog.

578
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,580
I know.

579
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:45,731
Yeah.

580
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:46,040
But we,

581
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,810
but it's also,

582
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,141
you know,

583
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:48,010
a slur for women.

584
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,700
So yeah,

585
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,780
but not always.

586
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,430
It's a lot of times square for men.

587
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,550
Well that it's become that just like
nigger is not always a slur for black

588
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:54,941
people.

589
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:57,100
It's also dude over there.

590
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,200
But you're allowed to call him.

591
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:00,070
If I say Jamie,

592
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:00,790
you nigger,

593
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,050
that's like a terrible thing.

594
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:02,720
I even,

595
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,221
I got wait,

596
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:04,054
slow down.

597
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,790
I got nervous even here to
come out of my own mouth.

598
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,001
Yeah,

599
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:07,834
exactly.

600
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,560
Like,

601
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,150
like settle down bitch.

602
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,450
Like that's fine.

603
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,340
I'm not telling you,

604
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,233
I'm not trying to,

605
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:13,990
you personally.

606
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,291
That's my,

607
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:14,471
yeah,

608
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:14,801
I'm just,

609
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:15,631
this is how I,

610
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:16,464
you know,

611
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,750
they got you got up,

612
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:19,840
but they may be already had me.

613
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,310
You're not going to go
my past and be like,

614
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:24,551
man,

615
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:25,440
he used to have,

616
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,590
he was the bitch guy.

617
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,240
Look at the amount of pitches he used.

618
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,230
Yeah.

619
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:29,440
Good.

620
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,460
It's really scaled back.

621
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:31,840
No one from three to zero.

622
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,390
I say other words,

623
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:35,560
I say nigger a lot.

624
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,981
It just,

625
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:36,814
I feel like I can,

626
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,100
but I don't say that in a
way where like I would never,

627
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,200
I would only jokingly
say to my black friend,

628
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:41,791
what's up my Nigga?

629
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:42,624
I wouldn't say that.

630
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,810
I don't call him that.

631
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,411
And I talk about,

632
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:46,270
I use the word nigger on stage a
lot cause I'm talking about it,

633
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,810
but I'm right.

634
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,490
So I'm not,

635
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,400
it's not the word police,

636
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:51,540
it's just we all just have our own
set of rules that we established.

637
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,860
So thrown off by your refusal of the
word bitch that I forgot what it is,

638
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,470
what my entire point was going to be.

639
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,340
That's my,

640
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,270
that's my goal.

641
00:14:59,330 --> 00:14:59,630
Yeah.

642
00:14:59,630 --> 00:14:59,951
I've got this,

643
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:00,260
it's like a,

644
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,093
you know,

645
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,731
when the cage,

646
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:03,630
I gotta make sure you
use your nervous gasket.

647
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,790
That's a good move.

648
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,420
Uh,

649
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,290
we were talking about,

650
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,130
uh,

651
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,480
oh Muhammad Ali,

652
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,710
I'm the greatest of all time.

653
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:10,521
And I was just saying that like,

654
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:11,181
some people loved it,

655
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:11,820
some people hate it.

656
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,130
It wasn't no doubt.

657
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,170
And the DIS,

658
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,390
the people love that conqueror mindset.

659
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,400
They love the person
who's extremely confident.

660
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,731
Yes,

661
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:22,370
they love love like Mike Tyson
when he was in his prime.

662
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:22,760
Yeah.

663
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,421
You know that,

664
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:23,810
that,

665
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,643
you know,

666
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,610
there's something about a guy who's at
his best who thinks he can do whatever

667
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:31,040
the fuck he wants and
then keeps pulling it off.

668
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,660
The people that love to see him fail,

669
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,370
but they also love to see them succeed.

670
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,350
But then some people
love to hate that guy,

671
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,350
you know?

672
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,340
So if that's there,

673
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:38,720
they,

674
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,220
they,

675
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,053
you know,

676
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,180
it's true of all these guys.

677
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:41,391
I mean,

678
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:41,720
you know.

679
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,170
Yeah.

680
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,010
Jon Jones thing,

681
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:43,300
you know?

682
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,571
Yeah.

683
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:44,880
The people also get God,

684
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,950
why is he so good?

685
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,320
Oh,

686
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,280
hate the hate that.

687
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:47,980
Hate that.

688
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,501
I don't like that.

689
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:49,210
He's so good.

690
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:49,760
Yeah.

691
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,020
There's no doubt there's a,

692
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:51,920
there's an issue with that,

693
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:57,130
but I speculate on what it's like to
be that guy when you are that good at

694
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:58,730
something like golf,

695
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:03,080
like a guy like tiger woods
who was arguably the greatest
golfer of all time or

696
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:04,320
right up there with them.

697
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:05,154
I mean for the,

698
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,410
the time when he was on a roll,

699
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:07,580
I'm not a golf historian,

700
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,890
but as he had like a,

701
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,550
like a 10 year run where it was
just like that we had was almost,

702
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,200
I think it was unparalleled where he just,

703
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:15,980
where he,

704
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,180
he was going to be competitive
every weekend and he played
golf and he was going

705
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:20,301
to,

706
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:20,961
he wasn't ever going to,

707
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:21,950
he was always going to make the cut.

708
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,630
And golfers I know enough that they,

709
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:24,560
there's wild swings.

710
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:26,590
Like a guy who wins one week may
not make the cut the next week.

711
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,070
It's mostly mental.

712
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:28,851
I mean it's left physical,

713
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:31,460
but it's also you have to hold
yourself together and recover.

714
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,020
And so there's wild swings in golf and
he had an amazing consistency that even

715
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:36,351
if he didn't,

716
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,351
when he was in the top 10 and then all
of a sudden that went away because it's

717
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:42,591
mental,

718
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:42,980
I think,

719
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,131
well,

720
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:43,990
like all sports is,

721
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,991
everything is mental.

722
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:46,970
But I think in that with golf especially,

723
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,260
like if you're,

724
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:48,830
if you're,

725
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,131
if you're,

726
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:50,540
if you're not mentally in the thing,

727
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,381
you can't do the thing.

728
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:53,030
It's not about your physical gifts.

729
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:53,751
He's still strong.

730
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:56,330
He's still bigger than everybody
does have physical issues too.

731
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:59,450
Now though doesn't he does a lot of
problems and knee problems and stuff.

732
00:16:59,480 --> 00:16:59,751
Yeah,

733
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:00,140
he does.

734
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,860
He does,

735
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,240
but a lot of that stuff and you know,

736
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:03,890
but he's still not too old too.

737
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,161
I mean,

738
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:07,250
you know tigers at the age that most
golfers are sometimes in their prime,

739
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:10,790
like in that like sort of late thirties
this is when he should be good.

740
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,470
Not Back.

741
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,251
But you know he's also,

742
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:13,870
he put,

743
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,970
he though he was the first Gulf to
put muscle on and really work out.

744
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,103
Sometimes you know,

745
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,170
if you put too much muscle on you
can fuck yourself up eventually.

746
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,531
Yeah.

747
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:22,880
Well then also fucks up your,

748
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:23,870
your coordination.

749
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:25,400
Sometimes like with pool players,

750
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,380
I play a lot of pool and pool players.

751
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,480
One of the things that happens to
them is they lift a lot of weights.

752
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,830
If they start lifting weights,

753
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:33,350
they start getting like
really tense pool players,

754
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:34,184
lift weights.

755
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,053
That's a thing

756
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,200
we'll place and trying to be more fit
because of being more fit gives you more

757
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:39,621
energy.

758
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:40,010
Yay.

759
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,761
Longer matches.

760
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:41,301
I understand that.

761
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:42,710
And you can maintain your concentration.

762
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:44,240
I know it seems counterintuitive.

763
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,840
I get that you would like want to be
in good shape but being buffed to play

764
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:48,140
pool,

765
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,381
he was like,

766
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:48,990
that would be,

767
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,190
that's kind of tough but

768
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,050
strong your core and you're like a lot
of times pool players develop back issues

769
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:56,430
because you're bending over all the time.

770
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,421
So,

771
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:57,691
uh,

772
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:00,450
just the idea that you're lifting
weights to keep your body strong,

773
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:01,051
but in doing so,

774
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:05,280
sometimes you'd create all this tension
and then that tension fucks up your feel

775
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:06,450
for where the ball's going.

776
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,420
And I would imagine the guy like
tiger started getting pretty buff.

777
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,050
You know,

778
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,680
there's a lot of that in like how you
knock a ball around on a golf course as

779
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:13,921
well.

780
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:14,330
Right.

781
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,440
It's just that delicate touch.

782
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:16,650
Yeah.

783
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,310
That it's fair that it's a lot of uh,

784
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,450
fast twitching and let attention
and releasing and yeah,

785
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,920
there was a guy named Willie hoppies,

786
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,040
like a famous billiards player
from the early 19 hundreds,

787
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,350
like one of the all time greats.

788
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:29,580
And he wouldn't even drive a car,

789
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,390
wouldn't even do anything with his
hands until he got to that table.

790
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,051
Just didn't,

791
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:35,280
didn't touch anything,

792
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,130
just like would eat his food
and just no tension at all.

793
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,370
He wanted his arms to
be delicate and loose,

794
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:43,200
so he had a full control where
the ball was going at all times.

795
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,740
I wish I could do that with the comedy.

796
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,811
I can't,

797
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:48,060
I can't talk and just got
to sit here and be in a,

798
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:48,380
yeah.

799
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:48,840
Yeah.

800
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,890
Some people like that,

801
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:50,101
man.

802
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:52,160
Some people rest their voice
and shit and they drink

803
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,600
like before the show.

804
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,830
I do like to do a thing where it's like,

805
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:57,150
just don't talk to me for an hour.

806
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,961
If it's a big show,

807
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:58,820
I do like the shit.

808
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,940
I like to shut it down.

809
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,960
I do the opposite.

810
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,470
Really?

811
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:01,801
Yeah.

812
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:02,071
Yeah.

813
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:02,741
When it's a big shot,

814
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,260
I like to talk a lot and have fun.

815
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,070
Oh yeah.

816
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,060
So that when I go out there,

817
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:06,894
I'm loose.

818
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,890
I'm having a good time.

819
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,181
I guess it depends.

820
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,300
Last night I did Largo and I d I had
the other comics backstage and we were

821
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:12,840
talking,

822
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,540
but I think it was because I want to do
that because there was a lot of industry

823
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,330
people out there and I just didn't want
it to focus too much on the fact that

824
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:18,840
like,

825
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:18,961
oh,

826
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:20,040
this is just my career,

827
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,530
you know?

828
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,520
Oh yeah,

829
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:22,050
yeah.

830
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,910
People paying attention
to you and staring at you.

831
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:24,181
What do we,

832
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:27,670
what can we do with money to
go in his general direction?

833
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,250
Can we sign him up for this?

834
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,203
It's Hildy.

835
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,173
Yes,

836
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,000
cause he the,

837
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,280
is he the friend of the guy,

838
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,490
neighbor,

839
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,310
the wacky neighbor that cosmo Kramer
is his way into the room and see the

840
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:38,651
feature.

841
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:38,821
Got It.

842
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,950
Comes in for six episodes
and everybody loves it.

843
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:42,000
Doesn't want to see him too much.

844
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,480
Yeah.

845
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,313
It could be that.

846
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:43,530
Yeah.

847
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,150
We can't overstate as welcome.

848
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,920
You had an awesome show man.

849
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,080
You had a really good show,

850
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,120
a groundbreaking show that for some
reason some fucking suits decided they

851
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:57,450
should take it from the
very profitable FX and Fx,

852
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:57,681
sex,

853
00:19:57,681 --> 00:19:57,991
sex,

854
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:58,291
sex,

855
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,040
sex,

856
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,820
which nobody even was
informed was a real channel.

857
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,691
It was a,

858
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:04,200
it was a,

859
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,441
I,

860
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:04,801
you know,

861
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:05,634
I,

862
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,650
I'm better for the show having happened.

863
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,180
I certainly feel like a little bit,

864
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,900
the show getting canceled and sent
way made it a better story for people.

865
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,460
Like you have now become like Woodstock,

866
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:16,350
like more people claiming they
were there then were there,

867
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,470
I watched it occasionally,

868
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:19,981
like we were like,

869
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:21,320
I was there every night and I couldn't.

870
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:21,841
But it's like,

871
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:22,674
but now people,

872
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,730
when it was gone,

873
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,960
people got more,

874
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,990
it got more attention
for it being gone and,

875
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:28,230
and so I really appreciate that.

876
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:28,501
But yeah,

877
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:29,334
it was a crazy,

878
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,120
well you,

879
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,681
you know,

880
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:30,920
you,

881
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,760
you were known for being a standup
comic and then all of a sudden you hear,

882
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,091
oh,

883
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:40,650
FX is doing a show with Kamau bell
and it's being produced by Chris Rock.

884
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:40,980
Yeah.

885
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,480
So whenever you say Chris Rock,

886
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,250
we all get excited when the greatest
comedians of all time it's producing this

887
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:46,561
show.

888
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:48,190
There's fucking show gotta be fantastic.

889
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,670
Absolutely.

890
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,360
And you,

891
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,100
what you did it,

892
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,500
I thought that was really unique is you
tackled some pretty interesting subjects

893
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,560
and some things that you never
see discuss like rape jokes.

894
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,420
I mean you had that thing with Lindy West,

895
00:20:58,421 --> 00:20:58,910
is that her name?

896
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,000
[inaudible] and Jim
Norton's that his name?

897
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,320
Yeah.

898
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,153
Yeah.

899
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,700
I used to want to fuck her name.

900
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,150
I appreciate you,

901
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:10,750
you guys got into some complex
subject matter for television,

902
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,160
which is late night television,

903
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,313
which is just,

904
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,870
I mean usually it's like my new
song is all about love and I never,

905
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,820
I never wanted a late night talk show.

906
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:19,810
It just ended up being,

907
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,340
that was the format that they called it.

908
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,690
Like I just wanted to show and they
said it comes on after 11 I'm like,

909
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,110
okay,

910
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,943
come on at eight.

911
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,470
But there's the thing if there's a person
who's standing on a stage talking to

912
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:36,370
an audience about the world and it's a
late night talk show and I was always

913
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:39,880
sort of rebelling against that format
and trying to make it just a show that I

914
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,714
would want to watch.

915
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,360
Well I think you did a
good job at doing that.

916
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,220
When when a show is on a network there's
always going to be like a bunch of

917
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:51,760
people that are also trying
to change the direction of it.

918
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:55,570
Like you got your ideas and then
you got your producers ideas,

919
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:59,230
which ad hopefully to your ideas and the
director's ideas which added and then

920
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:01,470
you've got an executive and hey man,

921
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,520
you had a lot of fucking
kick cooks in the kitchen.

922
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:04,450
Yes you absolutely do.

923
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,440
And that co coming from the world
of stand up and also the world zoom.

924
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,160
I like the solo show
that got me the thing.

925
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,890
I add friends helping me
and I had people help me.

926
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:12,701
But it was ultimately,

927
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:13,030
it was,

928
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,670
my words were the thing that we're
coming out of my mouth and my idea,

929
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,080
nobody people could say,

930
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:17,450
what should,

931
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,011
you should do this.

932
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:18,341
And I'd be like,

933
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:18,481
oh,

934
00:22:18,481 --> 00:22:19,300
I'll think about it.

935
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,133
But when you're in that,

936
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,150
that meat grinder environment,

937
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:23,380
especially when it became daily,

938
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,770
there's so many people who are sort of
yelling things at you and at some point

939
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,101
you just,

940
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:27,700
for lack of,

941
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,180
you can't.

942
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,380
If you can't top their idea,

943
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,160
you sort of go,

944
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,993
I guess we'll do that.

945
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,780
You know?

946
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,350
Or,

947
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,880
or if somebody goes like,

948
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:34,411
I just told her,

949
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:34,931
I said this yesterday,

950
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:35,764
like somebody will be like,

951
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,041
oh,

952
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,660
you know what I was thinking
we could do a cold open.

953
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:39,700
Well I don't really want to do a cold
open cause that's just not the kind of

954
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:40,300
show I want.

955
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,200
Well I think we have,

956
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,070
we have a big guest on,

957
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:42,821
we'll do the cold open.

958
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:43,900
Well I don't really want to do that.

959
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,370
Well I asked the guests he wants to do it.

960
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,301
Okay.

961
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:47,134
I guess we'll do it.

962
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,780
And then the guest shows up and go,

963
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,410
we're doing this call though.

964
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:49,601
He's like,

965
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,171
I don't want to do it.

966
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:50,530
And you go,

967
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:50,681
oh,

968
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:53,980
but we already bought the whip cream and
then suddenly have this vision of like,

969
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,660
why are we doing this?

970
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,510
Why we bought it?

971
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:03,150
Just there's this machine of television
and this machine that suddenly are just

972
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:04,090
as you either.

973
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,373
I felt like I was,

974
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,170
it was like a meat grinder and either I
was putting the meat in the grinder or I

975
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:09,370
was the meat for the grinder.

976
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,630
And in that format,

977
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:11,291
when it was daily,

978
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,520
a lot of days I was the meat.

979
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,150
I think it gets to a point where you're
like a John Stewart type dude where

980
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:16,660
you're,

981
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,640
you get to decide what
goes in the grinder.

982
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:18,941
Yeah.

983
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:19,990
And I think that Stuart,

984
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:21,160
I've read lots of stuff on him.

985
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:21,490
He,

986
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,050
it took him two and a half
years to get the daily show.

987
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:23,890
Like we don't all,

988
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,790
we think of the daily show,

989
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,440
we're really thinking about 10 the
last 10 years of the daily show me,

990
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:28,570
we're not thinking about that first.

991
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,960
When he first got there and took over
from Craig Kilborn and it was sort of a

992
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:32,794
wacky,

993
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,101
uh,

994
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:35,710
afternoon parody show
of like news event show,

995
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:35,990
you know,

996
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,080
so it was more of like a
pop culture type thing.

997
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,291
It was,

998
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:38,830
again,

999
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,180
it was like a parody of those.

1000
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:41,070
They don't really do these anymore,

1001
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,420
but those afternoons shows
that you see like you know,

1002
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,100
evening magazine,

1003
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,063
those things

1004
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,040
where it's like we went to the floor show
and found this new floors to Bubba and

1005
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:53,720
John took it a more political direction,

1006
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,793
but he had the,

1007
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,720
from everything I've read
comedy central didn't want it,

1008
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,710
but he was in a position where he
wasn't being told he was the face of the

1009
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:03,680
network and that all the pressure
was on him because they were,

1010
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:05,090
he had south park and he had all the,

1011
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,720
all the other stuff on comedy
central wears on effects on Fx FX.

1012
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,800
It was,

1013
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,660
they had one night of original
programming that wasn't,

1014
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,470
that included me when it was like the
league or it's always sunny or Jim

1015
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,370
Jefferies every other night.

1016
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,210
It would be like you'd be somebody be at
home watching a mad about you rerun and

1017
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:22,730
enjoying it and then suddenly a blackout
would come on screaming about the

1018
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:23,720
events of the day and I get,

1019
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:24,051
they'd be like,

1020
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:24,551
Whoa,

1021
00:24:24,551 --> 00:24:24,870
Whoa,

1022
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,703
Whoa,

1023
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,391
no,

1024
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:26,601
no,

1025
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:26,960
no.

1026
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,080
I was enjoying Paul Riser
from the 90s of black guy,

1027
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,770
a black guy.

1028
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,310
He just said that like in a way this that.

1029
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:36,290
Is that something you
are acutely aware of?

1030
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,300
Like how they were programming it like,

1031
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,310
because I'm aware of the audience.

1032
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:42,200
If you're watching a mad about you rerun,

1033
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,390
and I'm not in any way
insulting mad about you,

1034
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:45,220
but I'm saying if you're like,

1035
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,053
oh and salt,

1036
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:46,670
that's fine.

1037
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,050
Just don't shit's bad for America.

1038
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,390
Good for Paul Rogers Bay.

1039
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,070
I just don't have any opinion.

1040
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:52,481
It's at,

1041
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:53,314
that's your thing.

1042
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,990
If you're watching a rerun of some sitcoms
from the 90s and you're enjoying it,

1043
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:57,920
which you can,

1044
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,420
and then suddenly I come on screen and
I'm the op on basically the opposite of

1045
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:02,631
that.

1046
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:04,980
I'm a guy who's talking about right now
and not talking about what happened in

1047
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:08,210
the 90s and I'm a black guy and you're
just watching a bunch of white people on

1048
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:10,010
the upper west side of
Manhattan and talk about,

1049
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:10,190
well,

1050
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:10,581
we go,

1051
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:12,980
how are we going to get to the
coffee shop if we don't bump it up?

1052
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:13,881
And then I come on,

1053
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:15,200
they're talking about homophobia.

1054
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,561
You know,

1055
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:17,130
like I get this is,

1056
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,530
it's a hard transition.

1057
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:22,370
Whereas if there's a network
that's programmed where
I'm a part of the package,

1058
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,020
then it segues and things.

1059
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:25,450
We'll segue one into the other one.

1060
00:25:25,451 --> 00:25:25,700
Yeah.

1061
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,810
Not only it guy that's,

1062
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,743
you know,

1063
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,860
polar opposite of the nineties
during the current guy,

1064
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,990
but a progressive black cock intelligent
who's knocking about some controversial

1065
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,600
and it's hard to like,

1066
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,630
it becomes hard to box.

1067
00:25:38,631 --> 00:25:39,464
It's not like I'm doing,

1068
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:39,591
oh,

1069
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:42,060
this is what I expect black guys to do it.

1070
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,550
And I'm doing things where,

1071
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,121
you know,

1072
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:46,400
where I'm being vulnerable are also
talking about issues that I don't know

1073
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:47,720
anything about and I'm
trying to learn about them.

1074
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:48,300
Yeah,

1075
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:48,690
yeah.

1076
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,670
That's huge.

1077
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,331
And that's a,

1078
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:51,980
I thought it was an interesting approach,

1079
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,290
uh,

1080
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,640
of your show that you don't really see
too much when it comes to controversial

1081
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:55,940
issues.

1082
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,880
Like a guy who had set her pretending
to be the expert in everything and you

1083
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:00,020
know,

1084
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,040
the voice of reason,

1085
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,360
you kind of like laid back
and ask questions and try
to piece it together on the

1086
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:05,870
spot.

1087
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,880
That's what that was like.

1088
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,350
The man on the street stuff we did was
always this stuff people responded to the

1089
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:10,430
best of in addition to the,

1090
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,720
at the debates we did,

1091
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,590
uh,

1092
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,190
put like when I would go and treat and
talk to people and we would make comedy

1093
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:17,330
out of what we were talking about,

1094
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:18,410
whether we agreed or not,

1095
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,800
just out of like me talking to them
about whatever the issues were and that

1096
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:22,634
stuff,

1097
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,540
I always felt like my comedy that we
would have doesn't work if I pretend to be

1098
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:27,500
the smartest guy in the room.

1099
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,540
Like people say I'm smart,

1100
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:32,150
which sometimes when people say that
they feel like you're smart and they sort

1101
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:34,670
of shake your head like
I didn't expect that.

1102
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,870
Or also like industry,

1103
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:37,040
like we don't know what to do with that.

1104
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:37,820
Yeah,

1105
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,653
but I,

1106
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,900
so I will take that and I certainly
like to read no stuff like you do,

1107
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,220
but I'm not the smartest of my friends.

1108
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:45,810
I'm the funny one of my friends,

1109
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:46,321
you know what I mean?

1110
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:47,101
I'm the one who they're like,

1111
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:47,311
oh,

1112
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:47,640
come out.

1113
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,780
You don't know what you're talking about.

1114
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:48,991
You know,

1115
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:49,171
here,

1116
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:49,771
read this.

1117
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:53,120
And so that's the place that it
works best for me not to go on,

1118
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,090
stay on TV and be like,

1119
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:54,780
let me explain.

1120
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,450
Unless I'm talking about something
about being black in America,

1121
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:59,100
then I feel like I've got
some research I've done.

1122
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,810
I've done quite a bit of comic or
gay and that you're an expert in.

1123
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,181
Yeah.

1124
00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:03,541
Yeah.

1125
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,670
There's areas where I feel
like I will hold my opinion,

1126
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:06,331
but you know,

1127
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:06,961
for a lot of stuff,

1128
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:08,460
I'm just as I'm trying to see,

1129
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,870
we don't have to know
everything all the time.

1130
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,830
When I've watched your show,

1131
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:12,450
the first thing I thought besides that,

1132
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,190
this is a really good
show and really unique,

1133
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:15,420
is that you should be on the Internet.

1134
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,231
I'm like,

1135
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:19,080
why does it need just do this fucking
show on the Internet when he beat himself?

1136
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:20,340
100% yeah,

1137
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,690
because you can get the numbers on the
Internet that are just as big as any

1138
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:24,901
number.

1139
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:26,760
You got an FX xxx.

1140
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,050
Exactly the numbers we got.

1141
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:29,700
I think it was called historically low.

1142
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,720
I think I can do that on,

1143
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,773
on the Internet.

1144
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,100
But it seems like there's a,

1145
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:35,481
you,

1146
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:36,840
you developed a following.

1147
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,850
There's a lot of um,

1148
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,590
really a lot of positive reactions to
what you were doing and it seems like you

1149
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:46,680
can carry that onto the internet
smoothly and it would just take off like

1150
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:47,514
wildfire.

1151
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,380
Right now I was,

1152
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,850
there was a lot of things that
happened when the show got canceled.

1153
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,330
Like we were cause so me and my wife,

1154
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,020
my daughter moved to
New York for the shoot.

1155
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,580
We'd never lived in New York,

1156
00:27:56,581 --> 00:27:57,301
never thought of it like New York.

1157
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,410
My wife was born and raised in Monterey,

1158
00:27:58,411 --> 00:27:59,090
California.

1159
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,750
It doesn't want to be out
of northern California.

1160
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,160
So we moved in,

1161
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:02,611
I lived there.

1162
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:03,390
So we moved to this.

1163
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,620
So going to show that canceled.

1164
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,510
And then there was this period of like,

1165
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,201
I don't know who do you call it?

1166
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:08,034
Crippling depression.

1167
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,033
Like we're just like,

1168
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,990
what happens next?

1169
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:11,010
What do I do it right?

1170
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,810
Do we stay here?

1171
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,571
Do we leave?

1172
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:13,590
And then my wife got pregnant,

1173
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,280
she's pregnant with her
second kid graduations.

1174
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:15,510
Yeah.

1175
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,871
Thank you.

1176
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:16,141
Yeah.

1177
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:17,730
And so it was this thing about like,

1178
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:17,851
well,

1179
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:18,061
okay,

1180
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:18,840
now what do we do?

1181
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,800
Are we going to raise a kid?

1182
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,251
Like,

1183
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:21,360
are we gonna have a baby in New York?

1184
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,830
And they just sounded like a reality show.

1185
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:23,820
I didn't want to watch like,

1186
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:24,654
you know,

1187
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,580
these couple have a baby.

1188
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:26,971
No,

1189
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:27,511
we can't,

1190
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:28,344
not in Manhattan.

1191
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,390
And so we just moved back to the bay
like six weeks ago and everything in my

1192
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:34,224
life has been like,

1193
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,280
okay.

1194
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,240
Like I just feel like I can breathe again
and more about San Francisco than New

1195
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,840
York.

1196
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,470
Uh,

1197
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,960
I think New York is New York is
the greatest city in the world.

1198
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:43,681
I'm not trying to,

1199
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:44,221
I think it is,

1200
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:48,090
but it's also a hard city to live in if
I feel like if you're from there born

1201
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:48,511
and raised,

1202
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:49,344
you can do it.

1203
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,950
Or if you move there and have the means
to have the means to live the life you

1204
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:55,480
want or you're 22 you know
like I feel like those,

1205
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,180
but I'm not any of those
things at this point.

1206
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,143
If the bay,

1207
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,240
you get all the good
stuff that New York has,

1208
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:01,440
all the culture,

1209
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:02,101
all the ideas,

1210
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:02,934
all the diversity,

1211
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,870
but there's just a more is more
wide open space and there's more,

1212
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,640
there's more conversation.

1213
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,361
There's more like,

1214
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:09,601
you know,

1215
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:09,961
it just,

1216
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:11,550
it feels like you can,

1217
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,490
it's an area where people
move there to be curious.

1218
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,121
You know what I mean?

1219
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,020
Like they moved there and be like,

1220
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,320
oh,

1221
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm going to see if I can
turn my.com idea until,

1222
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,470
you know,

1223
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,181
or people go to,

1224
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:22,320
I'm going to go there to
be gay as I want to be.

1225
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,540
Find out if I can be too gay.

1226
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:25,111
You know what I mean?

1227
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:25,560
To Go,

1228
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,540
this is a $4 million house.

1229
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:27,841
Well,

1230
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:28,021
yeah,

1231
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:28,854
we live in Berkeley,

1232
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,030
so yeah,

1233
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,250
yeah,

1234
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:30,550
yeah.

1235
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:30,780
We,

1236
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,091
we,

1237
00:29:31,091 --> 00:29:31,591
we,

1238
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:32,370
I lived,

1239
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,430
I lived in San Francisco and moved back
and my joke is that San Francisco was

1240
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:35,551
like,

1241
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:36,450
now you live in Berkeley.

1242
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,343
It was like,

1243
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,240
I can't,

1244
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,550
you know,

1245
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,001
we can't,

1246
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,080
I can't live in San Francisco anymore.

1247
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,960
Nobody can know it's the city is only
seven by seven people don't realize that

1248
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:44,794
it's tiny.

1249
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,100
Yeah.

1250
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,660
And at some point I think Gavin Newsome,

1251
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:47,221
the mayor realized,

1252
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:47,381
wait,

1253
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:49,240
this could all be high end real estate.

1254
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,250
The entire city could behind real estate.

1255
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,240
That's kind of what it is now.

1256
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:52,450
Yeah.

1257
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,110
So it's become a thing where unless you've
lived there for 40 years and own your

1258
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:56,800
property,

1259
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,350
you are,

1260
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,040
people are being kicked out of like
old people are being kicked out of

1261
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,521
apartments.

1262
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:04,990
They've lived in for their entire lives
because landlords are turning their

1263
00:30:04,991 --> 00:30:07,210
buildings into condos and
it's really a big deal there.

1264
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,970
I lived in San Francisco
during the Vietnam War.

1265
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,560
I lived in San Francisco
when I was a little kid.

1266
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,830
When you said that was totally
like you were in the Vietnam War.

1267
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,290
And I'm like,

1268
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,810
that's so funny way that I lived there
in [inaudible] 72 I lived there during

1269
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:20,591
the Vietnam War.

1270
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:23,680
I was an objector conscious as
objective as a four year old.

1271
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,540
I was seven.

1272
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:24,930
Yeah.

1273
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,321
Yeah.

1274
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:26,154
I knew better,

1275
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:27,820
but uh,

1276
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,850
it shaped the way I
look at the world very,

1277
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:31,361
very,

1278
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:31,570
uh,

1279
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,290
very much so.

1280
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:32,741
It's a very,

1281
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:35,140
it's too open sometimes
I think people like it.

1282
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,260
San Francisco gets so liberally,

1283
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:37,091
gets conservative,

1284
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:40,240
like were there like where they get
very tunnel vision in their liberalness.

1285
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:40,760
So that's,

1286
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,860
but I think for me that's,

1287
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,680
I've learned to understand that and I
looked and that's a part of why I think my

1288
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:45,431
act of uptodate is,

1289
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:46,450
I've learned to fuck with that.

1290
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,171
Yeah.

1291
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:47,650
So I don't,

1292
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,461
it's not perfect,

1293
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:49,294
but it just,

1294
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,850
it just feels like you can breathe out
there and you still get all this stuff.

1295
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:52,331
Like you don't,

1296
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:55,750
you're not missing any of the concerts
or any of the movies or any of the food

1297
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:56,584
of New York,

1298
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,790
but you get to like,

1299
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,990
you get to a,

1300
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,940
everything's not 400 feet tall.

1301
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,170
That is an interesting thing though,

1302
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:02,531
isn't it?

1303
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:07,480
How like you can get so liberal that it
almost becomes conservative cause become

1304
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:11,140
so dogmatic and your idea because liberals
get very focused on their version of

1305
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:13,260
liberalism and so aggressive about it.

1306
00:31:13,261 --> 00:31:13,490
Yes.

1307
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:13,900
Yeah.

1308
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,171
Yeah.

1309
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:14,371
You know,

1310
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:14,650
that's,

1311
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:18,490
that's a big thing about it is it's
not about kindness and love and

1312
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:19,690
understanding so much.

1313
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:22,240
It's about pushing their
idea with kindness,

1314
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:23,770
love and understanding should be,

1315
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:24,490
and you disagree.

1316
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,110
You're a fucking mail pig.

1317
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,390
Patriarchal privilege.

1318
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,370
He's a shit die in a fire.

1319
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,571
He gets,

1320
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:32,830
it gets pretty aggressive.

1321
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,030
I agree with the white privilege part,

1322
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:34,864
but uh,

1323
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:35,920
no,

1324
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,753
I think that's,

1325
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,010
people don't realize and that's
what the show was trying to do,

1326
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,480
that people get caught up in.

1327
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,620
Like I'm a,

1328
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,513
for example,

1329
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,121
my friends,

1330
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:44,350
I've Milton black friends who are like,

1331
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:47,920
Milton black has the thing and
they sort of ignore like the,

1332
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:51,730
like the gay rights side of it and
suddenly somebody starts talking about gay

1333
00:31:51,731 --> 00:31:51,910
rights.

1334
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,151
Like no,

1335
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:52,960
that's not important.

1336
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,830
It's militancy,

1337
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:54,700
black militancy.

1338
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,930
And then there's gay people were like,

1339
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,311
no,

1340
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:56,410
no,

1341
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:56,561
no.

1342
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:57,670
Immigration is not important.

1343
00:31:57,671 --> 00:31:58,520
It's about getting,

1344
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,180
so people get caught in their lane
and his show and my life is about,

1345
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:02,560
and how we,

1346
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,130
all of us on the right side of the
issues need to get in the same hot tub

1347
00:32:06,131 --> 00:32:07,210
together and figure it out.

1348
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,511
You know,

1349
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:11,140
like we need to sort of talk that we're
all on the right side of me up until hot

1350
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:11,974
tub.

1351
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,900
That could be a problem.

1352
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,330
You don't get to talk to what gay dudes,

1353
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:21,410
what militants or in that you can't have
a fucking bra and a hot tub who has a

1354
00:32:21,411 --> 00:32:22,360
brawl in a hot thing.

1355
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,380
It can happen in a hot tub.

1356
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,340
I never saw a fucking guy knocked the
girl out in the elevator before the ray

1357
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:27,911
rice video,

1358
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:29,080
but apparently it's positive.

1359
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,670
I'm sure there's lots of footage you guys
get to know people getting knocked out

1360
00:32:31,671 --> 00:32:32,261
in elevators.

1361
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:35,860
But I think brought somebody Google
hot to abroad and see what comes up.

1362
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,110
This is a very famous story about a guy,

1363
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:40,850
I don't know if you heard
this one a few years ago.

1364
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:43,510
He was a newscaster and um,

1365
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,890
he was a gay guy that was in the closet.

1366
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,160
He's in like Oklahoma TV or
some shit like that and uh,

1367
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:49,431
you know,

1368
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:50,120
one of those.

1369
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,930
Thanks Bob.

1370
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,620
All right,

1371
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,760
today's top story.

1372
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:52,970
You know,

1373
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,320
one of those fucking weird guys.

1374
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,560
He woke up with a dead guy next to him.

1375
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,940
They had been doing
crystal meth all night and,

1376
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,970
and having gay sex and uh,

1377
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:06,440
the guy had a belt around his neck and
the guy is fixated while doing auto

1378
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:08,840
erotic fixation and he passed out.

1379
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:11,030
They passed out together in this hot tub.

1380
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,370
So he woke up in the hot tub,

1381
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,040
mapped out doing pills with a blue guy
next to him with a belt around his neck.

1382
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,351
But again,

1383
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:22,530
not a fight and not slide,

1384
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,900
allegedly were all,

1385
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,240
they were all in it together.

1386
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,640
Skiing,

1387
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,110
hot tub brawl leads to arrest,

1388
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,930
but that's Michigan man.

1389
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,090
Those are crazy white people.

1390
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:33,580
That's a different kind of human being.

1391
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,630
I love that you googled out to
have Raul and found something that

1392
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,330
I said that because I wanted to see
and I knew that I knew it was coming.

1393
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,731
Of course it is,

1394
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:44,620
but it's probably us.

1395
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,730
That style of fighting styles.

1396
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,390
It will be the next UFC hot tub.

1397
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:50,090
Rollen yeah,

1398
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,000
people use techniques you've got
to push off the back of the time.

1399
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,610
It's very important to get
the Ph balance of the water.

1400
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,540
It makes a big difference.

1401
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,440
Don't get it in your mouth.

1402
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,430
It'll affect your breathing.

1403
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,320
There's a lot going on with hot
tub brawling and hot to bro,

1404
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,311
but it's funny,

1405
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:04,911
one of my favorite,

1406
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:05,650
just to remind me,

1407
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,140
this is like one of my favorite things
about San Francisco and just favorite

1408
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:10,190
things I ever saw and so it was just cool.

1409
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:10,630
It was like,

1410
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,910
that's so gay community crystal method
has been a problem in the gay community.

1411
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,890
It's an awesome thing.

1412
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,000
Yet depends on dependents worked off.

1413
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,230
When you take somebody out there,

1414
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,370
is that really the Keith
Richards version of it?

1415
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,890
Like Crystal Meth is working for me.

1416
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:25,251
You know,

1417
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:26,084
somebody up there.

1418
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,560
It can't be bad for everybody.

1419
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:29,090
The otherwise I to stop selling it.

1420
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,250
Is that really how it works?

1421
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,610
Is that why Mcdonald's is open and some
people are eating it and feeling it.

1422
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,560
I had a fucking egg muffin this morning.

1423
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:37,480
It was delicious.

1424
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,630
Don't have one tonight.

1425
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,300
No Egg.

1426
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:45,650
Mcmuffins unlike crystal meth do not
require you to continue using them all day

1427
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:47,360
to maintain a state of normalcy.

1428
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:50,780
Maybe.

1429
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,460
I think we would like
you to use them everyday.

1430
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,240
They would,

1431
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,300
but they stopped selling them after 10:30
AM that's just cause they understand

1432
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:56,800
coming junkies.

1433
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,633
They understand.

1434
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,041
That's right.

1435
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:58,570
You can't get the,

1436
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,140
you can't get the egg
mcmuffin or up to 10 30,

1437
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:02,690
because we don't want to
cause a problem in America.

1438
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,960
There was a billboard in San Francisco,

1439
00:35:05,961 --> 00:35:07,330
like on the bus shelter,

1440
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,350
like in the gay
neighborhood where I had to,

1441
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,150
I used to take the bus from there,

1442
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:11,760
uh,

1443
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,280
cause I'd hang up and uh,

1444
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,010
there was a billboard and it
was a guy like all it was was,

1445
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:16,371
it was,

1446
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:16,790
uh,

1447
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,850
it was a billboard said don't do crystal
meth or something and the image of the

1448
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,410
billboard was a guy,

1449
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,273
I'll just do it like,

1450
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:22,810
like,

1451
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,210
so you're,

1452
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,400
it's like you're standing over
his shoulder and he's doing this

1453
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,930
and it was implied that he's getting
fucked in the ass and didn't know it

1454
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:31,010
because he was on crystal meth.

1455
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,610
Why he was the great,

1456
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:33,410
you're just like,

1457
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:33,980
ah,

1458
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,080
like he's got this horrified look on
his face cause it's from the priest and

1459
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:40,290
he's got his shirt off and it's from
the perspective of like awesome guys

1460
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,161
fucking him in the ass.

1461
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:44,380
So he's waking off yet in the middle
of like the crystal meth Hayes.

1462
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:49,420
He was making poor choices and it was
like a thing at the bus shelter right next

1463
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:51,594
to the Safeway,

1464
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,553
which is like,

1465
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,640
I love this city.

1466
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,890
I was like ridiculous ad though.

1467
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,390
I mean if he can greenlit,

1468
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:58,320
they got my attention.

1469
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,560
I haven't done crystal since or before.

1470
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,680
Thanks man.

1471
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,660
Learn wacky ads like that
sounds like a bad scene.

1472
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,430
I think San Francisco is like,

1473
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,420
if not the smartest one of the
smartest towns in the world.

1474
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,580
I mean I think it gets a
lot of credit for that,

1475
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:14,821
but I,

1476
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:15,530
and I think that it,

1477
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,321
it can be,

1478
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:19,590
but I also think that if you like the
comedy crowds get attention for being

1479
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:20,220
smart.

1480
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,300
I think that can be true,

1481
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:22,230
but it's also,

1482
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,420
you can also walk into San
Francisco Club and be like,

1483
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:25,620
where did these people come from?

1484
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,131
You know what I mean?

1485
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:27,210
Like there's tourists,

1486
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:28,560
but there's also just a lot of like,

1487
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,041
you know,

1488
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:30,210
I don't want to try and bridge and tunnel.

1489
00:36:30,211 --> 00:36:32,690
There's a lot of like people coming
into San Francisco and there's awesome

1490
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,120
crowd.

1491
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,790
The original San Francisco people
who live there are just people like,

1492
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:36,500
you will cry,

1493
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,070
you will go to neighborhoods
in San Francisco or like,

1494
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,371
you're like,

1495
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:40,030
these people don't know
it's the gas city on earth.

1496
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,791
Do the plumber.

1497
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:44,460
He doesn't know that this is like the
most progressive city in the plant on the

1498
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:44,850
planet.

1499
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,640
Do you think that this,

1500
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,850
this whole w w what,

1501
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:48,361
what'd you call it?

1502
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:49,200
Gentrification.

1503
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:52,410
Is that what they call it and I would
call it then people buy up the real estate

1504
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,660
and it's going through the roof
where they create neighborhoods where

1505
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,150
neighborhoods weren't before or should
have been and they didn't want to make a

1506
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:57,870
neighborhood.

1507
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,291
Is that,

1508
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:58,920
what can you do?

1509
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,090
What can they do to stop that?

1510
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:01,140
I mean almost nothing.

1511
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:01,951
The amount of money,

1512
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:06,090
the wealth that's in the
concentrated wealth makes it,

1513
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,261
I mean,

1514
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:09,930
unless we want to storm the streets
and get all like Ukraine in there,

1515
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,020
the concentrated wealth makes it damn
near impossible because the first,

1516
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:13,831
not the first way,

1517
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,110
but when I moved to San
Francisco in the 90s,

1518
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,190
there was the.com,

1519
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:18,270
the first.com bubble.

1520
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:19,590
And they tried to gentrify the mission.

1521
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,310
And back then what they
were doing was trying to,

1522
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:24,900
it was tearing down stuff and building
new things and neighborhood flexed on

1523
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:27,480
them and said in the mission that
historically Latino neighborhood and the

1524
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:28,231
neighborhood flex and said,

1525
00:37:28,231 --> 00:37:28,411
no,

1526
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:29,131
you can't do this.

1527
00:37:29,131 --> 00:37:29,881
And I don't know how he did it,

1528
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:30,714
but they stopped them.

1529
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,040
But now the money is so much bigger and
the bubble didn't burst and it's Google

1530
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,480
money and Facebook money,

1531
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:38,070
which is going to last
for the end of time,

1532
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,210
uh,

1533
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,530
time being 10 years from now.

1534
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,483
Uh,

1535
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:44,190
but that the money so concentrated that,

1536
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,250
and they're now being sneaky
about how they gentrified.

1537
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,490
They don't tear the buildings down.

1538
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,260
They make the buildings look
like they're the same buildings.

1539
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:50,220
They just redo the inside.

1540
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:50,641
Yeah.

1541
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:51,720
So it becomes invisible.

1542
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:52,554
So you just go,

1543
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,020
did you suddenly you don't know
that they're being re gentrified,

1544
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:55,441
but then you'd go,

1545
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:55,681
man,

1546
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:56,161
that's there.

1547
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:58,230
Sure are a lot more wine bars
around here than they used to be.

1548
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,880
But they don't look like
that from the outside.

1549
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:03,640
They look and you go into them and
they're just unbelievably renovated.

1550
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:04,110
Yes.

1551
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,970
Well what the fuck did you guys do?

1552
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,500
They've kept the outsides
and situate that.

1553
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:08,310
You don't that it's,

1554
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,091
it's more invisible.

1555
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:09,391
But yeah,

1556
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:10,110
the Google,

1557
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,790
like there's the Google
bus in San Francisco,

1558
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:16,110
like all the Google lights used to live
in like mountain view down by Palo Alto.

1559
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,470
But then Google does this thing
that's become very controversial.

1560
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,920
They have a free bus that will take you
from certain San Francisco neighborhoods

1561
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:24,750
straight to Google so that you,

1562
00:38:24,751 --> 00:38:29,550
so that the 25 year old people who work
at Google can live in the cool hip city,

1563
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,080
but then get to work for free.

1564
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:35,740
But what that does is that every
stop on the Google bus line,

1565
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,830
it changes the neighborhood cause people
want to live next to the Google bus

1566
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:39,580
line.

1567
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,160
And so then suddenly neighborhoods
that like it would have been a poor

1568
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:43,810
neighborhood or a struggling neighborhood.

1569
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,990
People are buying the property there and
renovating things and then pushing the

1570
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,920
other people out of the neighborhood.

1571
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,600
So in a sense the Google bus,

1572
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:52,180
which is good because it
keeps cars off the highway,

1573
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:52,990
right?

1574
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,660
And it also helps Google out because
people get on the bus and start working

1575
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:56,141
right away.

1576
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:57,070
So when people go,

1577
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,611
it's great,

1578
00:38:57,611 --> 00:38:58,480
we have free Wifi.

1579
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:58,721
No,

1580
00:38:58,721 --> 00:38:59,560
that's how you can work.

1581
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,540
So it takes cars off the road.

1582
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:02,980
It's extensively helps people.

1583
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,230
It keeps you from living in
places they don't want to live,

1584
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,630
but it changes the neighborhood and
kicks people out of the neighborhood.

1585
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:11,050
It's a very super controversial thing
that San Francisco is dealing with right

1586
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:11,350
now.

1587
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,920
San Francisco's and wealth for people
who don't know is in this weird,

1588
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:17,200
stupid category that
doesn't even make any sense.

1589
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:20,000
I have some friends that
live in Atherton and a,

1590
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,190
they rent a house there,

1591
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,100
but the house is worth $15 million

1592
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,190
and it's not worth 15 nine I know.

1593
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:28,090
You don't just not,

1594
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,080
you don't walk in and go,

1595
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:30,940
this is a $15 million house,

1596
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,331
dude.

1597
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:32,530
You don't even walk in and go,

1598
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:34,090
this is a $1 million house.

1599
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:35,080
It's just a house.

1600
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,040
It's a fucking normal.

1601
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:36,340
I mean,

1602
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:36,731
yes,

1603
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:37,564
it's worth,

1604
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,830
if I had a guest,

1605
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:41,230
like if you put it in a
decent neighborhood in,

1606
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,250
you know,

1607
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,500
studio city.

1608
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:43,641
Yeah,

1609
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:44,800
it's a $2 million house.

1610
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,850
It's a very nice house,

1611
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,860
but it's 15 fucking million dollars.

1612
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:48,400
Yes.

1613
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,480
It doesn't make any sense.

1614
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:50,520
And I'm walking around,

1615
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:50,801
I'm like,

1616
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:52,780
how is this house worth $15 million?

1617
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,160
It doesn't make any sense to me.

1618
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,240
It's a sauna.

1619
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,530
It's got a normal backyard.

1620
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,450
It doesn't have a view of the fucking,

1621
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,600
the continental divide and they'll
have a wiffle ball stadium.

1622
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,651
Crazy.

1623
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,401
It's crazy.

1624
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,590
The money there is so over the top,

1625
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,340
the concentrated wealth artificially
inflates the values of everything around

1626
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:09,490
it,

1627
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,740
which means people who've lived
there forever suddenly being told,

1628
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:12,550
you can't live here anymore.

1629
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,383
They can't afford it.

1630
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,940
It would have to look $15 million.

1631
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:16,211
It's like,

1632
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:17,290
what is the fucking mortgage on?

1633
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:17,920
Something like that.

1634
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,130
Yeah.

1635
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:18,581
You can't.

1636
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:18,731
Yeah.

1637
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:20,620
It's like that was a month or so.

1638
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,350
Which way do you have to have
to keep a $50 million house?

1639
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,730
The mortgage would be like
probably close to $100,000 a month.

1640
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,481
So that's a million,

1641
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:29,800
$200,000 a fucking,

1642
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,753
yeah.

1643
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,590
Yes,

1644
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,290
yes.

1645
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,380
That's insane.

1646
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,260
You and you haven't,

1647
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,550
what if the sink Britain,

1648
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:35,741
you know,

1649
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:36,191
there's all the,

1650
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:37,024
yeah.

1651
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,140
You know,

1652
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,621
you can't,

1653
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:39,660
you know the earth moves,

1654
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,340
the earth moves.

1655
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,050
Yeah.

1656
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:41,883
That's a big one.

1657
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,120
All the insurance because you're in,

1658
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,310
you're all at your house
is built on a fault line,

1659
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:45,881
you know?

1660
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:46,450
So,

1661
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:46,721
yeah,

1662
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:47,890
that is completely,

1663
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,560
it's,

1664
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:48,910
it's,

1665
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,301
it's,

1666
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:49,811
it sucks,

1667
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:50,381
but there's no,

1668
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:50,770
you,

1669
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,790
it's capitalism.

1670
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,240
You know,

1671
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,781
capitalism.

1672
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:54,910
Unchecked is not
necessarily the best thing,

1673
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:55,751
you know?

1674
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:58,840
And what's the option now if
you say capitalism unchecked,

1675
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,700
it's capitalism sort of.

1676
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,310
We'll always capitalism.

1677
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:04,480
I feel like unless you sorta go,

1678
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:04,661
hey,

1679
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:05,410
maybe we should,

1680
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,790
you know this should,

1681
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,650
we should keep an area for
people who've lived here.

1682
00:41:08,651 --> 00:41:11,530
We shouldn't allow people to get kicked
out of their houses for old people

1683
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:13,600
should never be kicked out of their house
and they're paying the rent that they

1684
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:16,660
were agreed to pay when they moved
in in 80 a hundred years ago.

1685
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,160
That's the things that have to be,

1686
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,950
people should be allowed to buy whatever
property they want to buy this for

1687
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:21,784
sale.

1688
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,640
But it's also a thing where you shouldn't
make it easier on those people and

1689
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:27,640
harder on the people who actually don't
have the ability to go live somewhere

1690
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:28,300
else.

1691
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,601
Yeah.

1692
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:32,260
It gets really tricky when they run out
of places they can go to two because

1693
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,110
when you're,

1694
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,150
especially if you have a
rent control type situation.

1695
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,660
Yeah.

1696
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,021
Once,

1697
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:37,220
if they boot you out of that,

1698
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:38,001
good fucking luck,

1699
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:39,410
find a place for 800 bucks a month.

1700
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:39,741
No.

1701
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:39,960
And,

1702
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,141
and,

1703
00:41:40,141 --> 00:41:40,600
and,

1704
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,360
and as fear,

1705
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,860
if you're an old person,

1706
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:43,221
you know,

1707
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:43,550
you're,

1708
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,810
you don't know,

1709
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:47,390
your family may not live in
the area and you have to go,

1710
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:47,961
you're suddenly,

1711
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:49,620
you're moving all your shit like your dad.

1712
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:49,820
Like,

1713
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,091
you know,

1714
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:50,750
like what,

1715
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,370
who wants to do that in
my mom was in Bloomington,

1716
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:52,760
Indiana.

1717
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,990
She pays $600 a month I think
for a two bedroom townhouse.

1718
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,860
Wow.

1719
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,191
Yeah.

1720
00:41:58,191 --> 00:41:58,581
And it's,

1721
00:41:58,581 --> 00:41:58,751
it's,

1722
00:41:58,751 --> 00:42:00,890
it's not nice but it's for $600 a months.

1723
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,060
It's a nice,

1724
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:02,331
you know,

1725
00:42:02,331 --> 00:42:02,901
like it's a,

1726
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:03,680
you know,

1727
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,190
and,

1728
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,370
and I think about that and there's no
way anywhere in the bay area that she

1729
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:07,881
could ever,

1730
00:42:07,881 --> 00:42:09,410
like we talked about her
moving out there and I'm like,

1731
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:09,740
I don't,

1732
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,071
I don't,

1733
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:11,510
I'm not making that FX money anymore.

1734
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,530
We have to figure out,

1735
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:12,790
yeah,

1736
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,450
we got to get something else going
before we can move you out of here.

1737
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:16,280
Cause you're not gonna find
anything for $600 a month.

1738
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:17,270
Berkeley's nice though.

1739
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:17,861
I like Berkeley.

1740
00:42:17,861 --> 00:42:19,100
Berkeley is milk calm.

1741
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,641
It's like a,

1742
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:21,500
it's an interesting sort of environment.

1743
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:22,820
It's a super leftie,

1744
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:23,900
very hippy environment.

1745
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:25,310
But it's also not,

1746
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,580
it's also very sort of young and
a little bit gutter punk too.

1747
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,780
It's like you,

1748
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,960
it's funny like if you go down by
the downtown Berkeley Bart Station,

1749
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,340
it is very gutter punk and like sort of
kid spare changing and you know it's a

1750
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:38,140
very sort of,

1751
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,440
it's,

1752
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,450
it's a place that those people hang out
and I was down there with my daughter

1753
00:42:41,451 --> 00:42:43,130
pushing the stroller and
I felt like the Weirdo,

1754
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,170
like pushing the baby store,

1755
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:46,520
like we're not gonna get a baby frog.

1756
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,421
Oh that's weird.

1757
00:42:48,421 --> 00:42:50,570
He's selling it like I
felt like I'm the Weirdo.

1758
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:51,710
You guys are all in the streets.

1759
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:57,130
Well does that San Francisco and the
bay area itself is so accepting of like

1760
00:42:57,621 --> 00:42:58,540
homeless people.

1761
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,351
We all would foot,

1762
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:03,560
I forgot how many like living in
New York for two years in New York,

1763
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:04,910
people think New York
has a homeless problem.

1764
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:05,241
It's like,

1765
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:05,661
no,

1766
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:07,310
you guys have about 12 dudes.

1767
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,960
I've met them all while I was there.

1768
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,580
They're all very nice.

1769
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,690
But like San Francisco,

1770
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:12,000
it's a,

1771
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,010
it's thick with it or the bay area
because it's temperate and we have social

1772
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,520
services for those people and that is,

1773
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,500
that is a good thing.

1774
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,470
And I lived in a neighborhood where I
knew all the homeless people and they were

1775
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,251
all pretty cool.

1776
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:24,170
There was was really a time
when I had a problem with it,

1777
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:24,440
you know,

1778
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,273
you know,

1779
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,110
and they just do their thing and,

1780
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:27,561
and you know,

1781
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:28,191
it's also great,

1782
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:31,070
the hidden benefit of homeless people
when you walk out of here in San

1783
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:31,071
Francisco,

1784
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:33,980
there's a culture of if you walk out of
a restaurant and you have leftovers and

1785
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:35,150
you don't want to eat them,

1786
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,910
you just put him on a trashcan
and you blink and they're gone.

1787
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,370
Right.

1788
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:39,530
When you feel like you did something,

1789
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:40,491
yeah,

1790
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:41,450
I'm a good person.

1791
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,040
Whereas it's not that culture.

1792
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,600
I'm glad to be back in that culture.

1793
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:46,250
You feel like I've done a good thing.

1794
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,250
I'm a charitable individual cause
I didn't finish my spaghetti.

1795
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,353
That's funny.

1796
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,010
Do you think that,

1797
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,760
well,

1798
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,610
I think the real issue is a
lot of these people are like,

1799
00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:00,790
they have mental issues and the mental
health care in this country just doesn't,

1800
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,510
doesn't,

1801
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,410
it's not up to snuff.

1802
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:03,890
I mean,

1803
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:08,030
these people are just not being taken
care of the way a culture should probably

1804
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:09,260
look after its citizens.

1805
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:09,411
Well,

1806
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:09,621
yeah,

1807
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:10,340
and I think I've,

1808
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,540
I don't know this for sure,

1809
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:13,970
but from what I heard in the
barriers when Reagan was governor,

1810
00:44:13,971 --> 00:44:14,740
he turned out,

1811
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,220
he opened up the doors in the hospital.

1812
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,420
It wasn't just when he was governor,

1813
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,254
when he was president,

1814
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,191
he became president.

1815
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:20,000
He changed the,

1816
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,570
the,

1817
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,000
what the requirements are and you know,

1818
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:23,260
said,

1819
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:23,391
Oh,

1820
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:24,440
you guys can feed yourself.

1821
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:25,400
You can put a fork to your mouth.

1822
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:26,234
But yeah.

1823
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:26,931
Oh yeah,

1824
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:27,540
you're free.

1825
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,373
You're free.

1826
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,280
Mental health issues are,

1827
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:31,080
are serious and,

1828
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:31,410
and it's,

1829
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,010
and forget

1830
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,311
homes.

1831
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:32,690
You will,

1832
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:35,130
America's probably number one
issue with mental health issues.

1833
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:35,941
I mean,

1834
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:38,530
you know if the win when we go to the,

1835
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,870
take it back to the football player thing,

1836
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,050
the NFL rookie symposium suit involves
sitting down with a therapist and talking

1837
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:43,370
about,

1838
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:43,860
ah,

1839
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,101
okay,

1840
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:46,560
you're about to make a lot of money
and you had everything in life,

1841
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,790
but let's try to figure out what,

1842
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,490
what in your past is going to lead you
to make bad decisions in the future?

1843
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,110
That's all well and good,

1844
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:55,080
but the reality is you're never going to
be able to change anybody out and have

1845
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,370
a fucking conversation.

1846
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,960
The reality being a guy who's poor to
being a guy who's a fucking NFL superstar,

1847
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:02,040
making millions of dollars.

1848
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:03,091
Boy,

1849
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:03,811
what a transition.

1850
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:04,960
I don't mean one conversation.

1851
00:45:04,961 --> 00:45:05,071
Yeah,

1852
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:05,904
I mean like,

1853
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:06,720
yeah,

1854
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,051
I feel like,

1855
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:07,500
I mean,

1856
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,900
I actually feel like every black
person in America that would,

1857
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,940
I'll take those reparations free therapy,

1858
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,280
just give every black person in America
a free therapy session once a week for

1859
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,210
the rest of their life.

1860
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,280
It will change the,

1861
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:23,760
it'll change American white people
need therapy to speak for you people.

1862
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:24,240
I'm just thinking,

1863
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,140
how dare you.

1864
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,833
You people,

1865
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,693
you people,

1866
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,530
that's how it works.

1867
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,363
Yeah.

1868
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,120
I'm married to one of your
people so I can say that.

1869
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:31,770
Good for you.

1870
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,280
Yeah.

1871
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,390
Thank God someone's doing it.

1872
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:34,224
Yeah.

1873
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,780
I think also the,

1874
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,490
the real problem with NFL players,

1875
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,230
the unaddressed problem
with mental health,

1876
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:42,210
it's also the fucking concussions.

1877
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,140
You know,

1878
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,490
the one thing about concussions is it
creates depression and it makes guys way

1879
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:50,100
more susceptible to
being impulsive violence,

1880
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:50,971
more PSAs.

1881
00:45:50,971 --> 00:45:52,050
And you're also,

1882
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:54,600
you're so used to a violent world,

1883
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:59,220
a world of constant collisions and
explosions and pushing people off you and

1884
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,080
screaming at people on the line.

1885
00:46:01,081 --> 00:46:04,350
And in that world it's Def,

1886
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:09,060
it's difficult to transition between
that world and the calm world of domestic

1887
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:09,450
living.

1888
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,320
And I think that's true.

1889
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,690
I just sit when sometimes when people say
that they make it sound like that's an

1890
00:46:12,691 --> 00:46:13,524
excuse for what?

1891
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,850
For domestic abuse.

1892
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:15,631
That like,

1893
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:15,931
well he's,

1894
00:46:15,931 --> 00:46:18,240
these are violent men and
violet would a violent game.

1895
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:18,571
And I feel like,

1896
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:18,721
yeah,

1897
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:19,321
that's true.

1898
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:22,140
But they still have to be
human beings outside of that.

1899
00:46:22,141 --> 00:46:22,791
They still didn't get it.

1900
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:23,624
They can't take it down.

1901
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,810
And I don't know the challenge of that.

1902
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:25,650
I'm not saying it's easy,

1903
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:26,910
but I certainly feel like we have to,

1904
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,070
you still have to walk around in society,

1905
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:29,521
you know,

1906
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:29,881
unless we,

1907
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:30,681
what do we just housing.

1908
00:46:30,681 --> 00:46:34,710
I felt players in a separate property and
you know like in the sort of keep them

1909
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,210
away from general population,

1910
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,240
but think it's something that the people
that are involved in the sport from a

1911
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,490
high school to college
coaches to everyone.

1912
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,260
It's something that's not addressed,

1913
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:49,010
but it's one of the most difficult
aspects of competitive athletics,

1914
00:46:49,011 --> 00:46:49,801
sports combat,

1915
00:46:49,801 --> 00:46:50,610
sports as it were.

1916
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:50,820
Yeah.

1917
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,500
I consider football combat sport.

1918
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,120
Absolutely.

1919
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:53,750
You know what I mean?

1920
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,160
Those guys are fucking run
and knew each other full clip.

1921
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:57,090
But if that's not comment,

1922
00:46:57,091 --> 00:46:58,350
what the fuck has no,

1923
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:58,831
it absolutely.

1924
00:46:58,831 --> 00:46:59,130
Yeah.

1925
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:04,130
So I think that just the realities of
dealing with being a combat athlete or any

1926
00:47:04,351 --> 00:47:06,180
sort of explosive athlete,

1927
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:08,970
you're dealing with physical
contact on a regular basis,

1928
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:11,250
call it whatever you want that that's,

1929
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,280
it's hard to be a functional member of
a calm stayed normal society on top of

1930
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:18,900
doing that.

1931
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,040
At the same time he had the,

1932
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:23,400
and just especially like the w like
you're saying like to me I always think

1933
00:47:23,401 --> 00:47:24,600
about the fact that these guys,

1934
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:24,961
again,

1935
00:47:24,961 --> 00:47:27,810
it's like the professional athletes
have been since high school now since

1936
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,560
seventh or eighth grade been sort of,

1937
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,130
the rules

1938
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,310
had been changed and they've been coddled
and you you don't have to go clean.

1939
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,210
Yeah,

1940
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:34,361
yeah,

1941
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:34,961
exactly.

1942
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:35,241
Yeah,

1943
00:47:35,241 --> 00:47:35,410
yeah,

1944
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,243
yeah.

1945
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,660
You don't have to go to class.

1946
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:39,400
Well you don't have to do
these things and you don't,

1947
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,640
and so sometimes they don't get the life
skills that a regular person would get

1948
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,510
because they've been sort of segregated
from regular society and you give

1949
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:49,390
somebody $1 million and tell him that
they're the best and like the same thing.

1950
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:49,660
I,

1951
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,180
I feel the same way about comedy sometimes
I come off stage after our goods that

1952
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:54,850
I feel like I am the best
thing this world has ever seen.

1953
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,120
Well that's definitely an
issue with like sitcoms,

1954
00:47:58,121 --> 00:47:58,954
stars.

1955
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,320
Yeah.

1956
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,370
That's a big issue,

1957
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:00,880
man.

1958
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,190
I've been around people that
like run their own shows.

1959
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:04,730
They have their own Sitcom,

1960
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,750
they're yelling at the producer and
yelling at the other actors and yelling at

1961
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:08,110
everyone.

1962
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:08,960
And I mean there's,

1963
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,140
there's a hundred stories of like,

1964
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:11,741
you know,

1965
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:12,281
Roseanne,

1966
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:13,600
when she was running the Roseanne show,

1967
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:15,670
Brett Butler when she
was on grace under fire.

1968
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:17,980
And it's like you can go on and on and on.

1969
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,720
There's a million different stories that
have to do with people that become the

1970
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:23,710
star of a show.

1971
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,480
It's the Kamau bell show.

1972
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:25,751
I mean,

1973
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:27,140
there were everybody shut the fuck up.

1974
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:28,870
Well,

1975
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,920
I'm sure if we brought in some
of the staff and totally buys,

1976
00:48:30,921 --> 00:48:32,470
they would tell you
stories about me like that,

1977
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:32,891
you know?

1978
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:33,724
And not that I,

1979
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,330
I sir.

1980
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,280
It's when you are putting a
position where you're the focus,

1981
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:38,620
everybody's attention for all day long,

1982
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:39,454
every day.

1983
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,140
I can say it tweaks your head.

1984
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,870
Like it tweaked my head in a
way that I certainly was not,

1985
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,441
I don't think I,

1986
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:45,430
Brett Butler did ever,

1987
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:45,941
I don't think I,

1988
00:48:45,941 --> 00:48:46,481
Roseanne did,

1989
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:46,600
but,

1990
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,260
and maybe I should have.

1991
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,720
Sometimes I should have because I
think sometimes you have to sort of go,

1992
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:51,010
everybody pay attention.

1993
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,370
But I certainly was not
the best version of myself.

1994
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:56,200
And that's one thing that
when I left I felt like,

1995
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:57,041
all right,

1996
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:57,790
I can sort of figure,

1997
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,220
I can return back to that dude who
got the show in the first place.

1998
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,420
Well also a producer who comes up with
a wacky idea that make would make you

1999
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:05,254
look bad.

2000
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,490
It doesn't hurt him.

2001
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,160
If he,

2002
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:07,720
if you,

2003
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,000
if he talks you into doing this
wacky idea and you're like,

2004
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:11,200
this wacky idea sucks.

2005
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:11,471
No,

2006
00:49:11,471 --> 00:49:11,620
no,

2007
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:11,831
no.

2008
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:12,410
Listen,

2009
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,181
we talked this through.

2010
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:15,350
Just give it a shot to play ball with her.

2011
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:15,640
Yeah.

2012
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,610
You're going to let you do that thing
on rape jokes like you to do this thing

2013
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:19,260
where you,

2014
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:19,510
you know,

2015
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:20,980
you put fucking blackface on.

2016
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:21,560
Yeah.

2017
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,690
But you know what I mean?

2018
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:22,901
Yeah.

2019
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:23,051
No,

2020
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:24,100
I know exactly what you mean.

2021
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:24,341
Yeah.

2022
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:24,791
Do it.

2023
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:25,541
And it doesn't work.

2024
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:26,830
You look like a fucking idiot.

2025
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,130
They don't feel anything.

2026
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,900
And I think there's also this
thing where people think fit.

2027
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,260
There's a like people,

2028
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,260
I think there's this weird thing in
the entertainment issue now where some

2029
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:37,720
people like they still don't
get the internet and they go,

2030
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:41,170
well you like it used to be Johnny Carson
on the tonight show and did a stupid

2031
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:42,280
thing that made you feel stupid.

2032
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,990
Nobody ever could even do it.

2033
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,193
See it again.

2034
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:45,941
It was gone.

2035
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,650
It was in the annals of time.

2036
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,430
But I'm like,

2037
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:48,581
no,

2038
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:49,660
this exists forever.

2039
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:53,290
Like if you make me do something
stupid that I don't like to do,

2040
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,200
I will be hearing about it for
the rest of my life on some level.

2041
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:56,420
Yeah,

2042
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,040
no doubt.

2043
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,873
No doubt.

2044
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,730
I think that's the thing you were saying
about like it just becomes this thing

2045
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,740
where it's a sea change.

2046
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,230
You know it's also this
different time hasn't,

2047
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:07,450
they haven't caught up
to the reality of it yet.

2048
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:11,800
Like one of the things about your show
is you had a late night show but late

2049
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,120
night shows have become,

2050
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:13,890
they've,

2051
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:14,530
they've had,

2052
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:18,310
they have this sort of
symbiotic relationship with
the Internet now because one

2053
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:22,840
of the big things is getting a clip
that people find about online and they,

2054
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:23,171
you know,

2055
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:23,711
Facebook,

2056
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:25,450
it back and forth to
each other and you go,

2057
00:50:25,451 --> 00:50:26,740
oh listen to this cool,

2058
00:50:26,741 --> 00:50:28,590
funny thing that Conan did,

2059
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,420
you know,

2060
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,720
and then we'll get this skit.

2061
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:31,281
Yeah,

2062
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:31,440
look,

2063
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,090
yeah.

2064
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:35,240
And that becomes a great way to
get people aware of the show.

2065
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:40,340
So it's almost like the time that it's
on is not nearly as important as the fact

2066
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:41,300
that it's being made.

2067
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,090
And what the,

2068
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,651
I ran into him,

2069
00:50:43,651 --> 00:50:44,001
my shows,

2070
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:44,660
cause I wasn't,

2071
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,740
I didn't grow up wanting to,

2072
00:50:45,741 --> 00:50:46,760
because I read every book,

2073
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,110
the late books that Bill Carter Road,

2074
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,950
all those dudes grew up wanting to be
late night talk show host like Conan and

2075
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:53,660
Kimmel and they all kids.

2076
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,880
Letterman was a hero and
Carson was their hero.

2077
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,110
I didn't grow up that way.

2078
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,041
I grew up,

2079
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:59,030
Chris Rock was my hero.

2080
00:50:59,031 --> 00:50:59,451
You know what I mean?

2081
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:02,990
Like I want to be a standup and he
had a show on HBO then I was like,

2082
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:03,561
I want it.

2083
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,041
But it wasn't,

2084
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:06,350
nobody thought it was a late
night shows the Chris rock show.

2085
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:06,741
Right?

2086
00:51:06,741 --> 00:51:08,100
I mean Stuart,

2087
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:08,780
I like Stuart.

2088
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,130
Like that's hits the Jon Stewart show.

2089
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:11,300
It's not a late night talk show,

2090
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:13,160
but once I got put in that world,

2091
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,630
suddenly there was this thing about like,

2092
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,290
do you have any famous friends we could
put on here who could come in here?

2093
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:22,190
Like the way that Fallon does a thing
with Justin Timberlake and Fallon was on

2094
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:23,870
SNL for eight years.

2095
00:51:23,871 --> 00:51:25,970
Like he knows his Rolodex
is filled with everybody.

2096
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,320
I was in the bay area,

2097
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:27,711
you know,

2098
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:31,130
I don't have the ability to reach
out to this pain near a meth sign.

2099
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:31,641
Exactly.

2100
00:51:31,641 --> 00:51:31,820
Yeah,

2101
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,281
exactly.

2102
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:32,811
I was not going,

2103
00:51:32,811 --> 00:51:33,051
man.

2104
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:35,540
I'm not going to crystal meth and
I'll call the guy from the poster.

2105
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:38,600
I'll call the the Asian twink from
the poster to come on the show.

2106
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:39,040
But yeah,

2107
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,531
be careful.

2108
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:43,580
You can't say twink Andy Collin
got in trouble for saying twink.

2109
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:44,210
Oh is that?

2110
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:44,421
Well,

2111
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:44,960
I certainly,

2112
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,650
I feel like I'm calling them
that because that's the,

2113
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,960
they were portraying it was that way.

2114
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:49,410
I'm not saying that all areas are twins.

2115
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:54,970
Twink you not allowed to use it anymore
and decided not to say that one.

2116
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,080
The guy that had a bravo who's,

2117
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:57,680
oh yeah,

2118
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:57,890
no,

2119
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:58,311
yeah,

2120
00:51:58,311 --> 00:52:00,380
I got in trouble for saying
someone's a perfect twink.

2121
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:01,970
It's preposterous.

2122
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,301
Well,

2123
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:02,570
it's,

2124
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:03,230
it's again,

2125
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,090
it's everybody seeing everybody's shit.

2126
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:05,721
Well,

2127
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:06,650
they used to be that you could only,

2128
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,020
you only saw your shit and
the shit you interested in.

2129
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:09,520
So,

2130
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,030
and when you're the head of a network,

2131
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,560
it's a totally different deal.

2132
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,860
It's not like I said it and
somebody may tweeted me and told me,

2133
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:16,270
I have to say,

2134
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:16,581
and I'm like,

2135
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:16,970
oh,

2136
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,370
but I'm not responsible
for billions of dollars.

2137
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,340
If someone does tweet you and tells
you not retweet the shit out of that,

2138
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,300
what do you mean that to let people know
that everybody in that little cool look

2139
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:26,661
at this,

2140
00:52:26,661 --> 00:52:27,494
talk to this guy.

2141
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:27,711
Yeah.

2142
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:27,951
I mean,

2143
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:28,860
I've let people react,

2144
00:52:28,861 --> 00:52:29,511
said people.

2145
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:29,960
I mean,

2146
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,260
I,

2147
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,400
the thing I like to do that when people
say shitty things to me that I think are

2148
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,720
actually just shitty and not helpful.

2149
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,350
I,

2150
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:37,640
I've turned a few people,

2151
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:38,031
I've,

2152
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:38,260
uh,

2153
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,500
I've made people apologize.

2154
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:40,100
Just,

2155
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:40,371
yeah,

2156
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:42,020
just out of sheer,

2157
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:46,370
like I kido sort of like taking their
energy and putting it in the wall and

2158
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:46,581
then,

2159
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:48,110
and then bringing them back
to you and do it again,

2160
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:50,000
and then we just put it back
in the wall and then they go,

2161
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:50,541
yeah,

2162
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:50,900
you're right.

2163
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,651
You're pretty good guy.

2164
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:52,484
I was probably out of luck.

2165
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:55,010
Like that's my favorite thing to
do is to turn people on Twitter.

2166
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,770
Don't you think that a lot of people
are doing it just to get your attention?

2167
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:57,980
There?

2168
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:58,671
Absolutely are.

2169
00:52:58,671 --> 00:53:01,250
But that's why I think it's fun if you
can actually make them feel bad for

2170
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:02,084
getting your attention and,

2171
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:04,850
but not from like calling
them now from yelling at them,

2172
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,310
but from taking their
energy and sort of like,

2173
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,020
actually sometimes people will say,

2174
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:11,540
I'm not shitting you actually treat
it like it's serious and well,

2175
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:11,781
that's,

2176
00:53:11,781 --> 00:53:12,051
you know,

2177
00:53:12,051 --> 00:53:12,381
and they go,

2178
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:12,561
no,

2179
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:13,394
I'm just,

2180
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:13,970
no,

2181
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,010
I'm trying to listen
to what you're saying.

2182
00:53:15,011 --> 00:53:15,390
Like they,

2183
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,660
and they get frustrated
because you're not mad.

2184
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,250
And I like to win.

2185
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:19,941
Not that I do is,

2186
00:53:19,941 --> 00:53:21,380
it's like when I'm on the
road and I'm by myself,

2187
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:21,681
it's like,

2188
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:21,981
all right,

2189
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:22,221
let's,

2190
00:53:22,221 --> 00:53:22,580
uh,

2191
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,090
it's not,

2192
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:24,350
I'm not yelling at them.

2193
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,280
I'm fucking with them back

2194
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,490
in a way that they don't realize that,

2195
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,730
that you should be mad.

2196
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:28,960
No.

2197
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,790
Now they know.

2198
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:29,990
Yeah.

2199
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:30,140
No,

2200
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:30,420
no,

2201
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:30,600
no.

2202
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,433
Your strategy,

2203
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:34,710
some fucking news of attack.

2204
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:35,551
We'll see what happens.

2205
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:36,390
I'm ready for it.

2206
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,253
Or I'll just ignore it.

2207
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:39,541
I'll just ignore it.

2208
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:39,810
Yeah,

2209
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:40,080
yeah,

2210
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,291
yeah.

2211
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:42,600
Some new matador tactics you're
going to have to come up with.

2212
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,460
Yeah.

2213
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,460
Dealing with people online is amazing.

2214
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:45,800
It's a,

2215
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,800
it's an amazing thing that no one
was prepared for that you know,

2216
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:51,330
interacting with people on message boards,

2217
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:51,901
on Twitter,

2218
00:53:51,901 --> 00:53:53,280
on Facebook and all these different,

2219
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,920
if we had this at the beginning
of the United States of America,

2220
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:57,240
we wouldn't be in the future right now.

2221
00:53:57,241 --> 00:54:00,930
We'd still be in like wagons and
buggies like I feel like it's ticket.

2222
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,180
It is slowing down progress.

2223
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:04,620
By the time they were all spinning,

2224
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,120
arguing about bullshit online.

2225
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,470
Don't you think though that,

2226
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:08,130
look,

2227
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:12,150
I don't agree with a lot of the social
justice warriors and their tactics and

2228
00:54:12,151 --> 00:54:14,940
the professional victim mentality
that a lot of them portray,

2229
00:54:14,941 --> 00:54:17,840
but in I feel like our
student for good people,

2230
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:20,580
I feel like social justice
people and professional victims.

2231
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,290
I just think that's isn't that
two different groups of people?

2232
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,400
It can be.

2233
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:23,820
Okay.

2234
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,160
All right.

2235
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,130
Point is like really whiny,

2236
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,510
overly sensitive,

2237
00:54:27,511 --> 00:54:28,770
super progressive,

2238
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:29,730
aggressive people.

2239
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:35,270
I think though that it opens up the
dialogue and forces people to even,

2240
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,490
even if you're communicating about it
in a way where you're defending your

2241
00:54:38,491 --> 00:54:39,324
position,

2242
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:42,390
that that conversation
gets like a perfect one.

2243
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,750
The perfect subject is a,

2244
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,680
this subject is coming up a lot lately,

2245
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,280
uh,

2246
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,700
where a lot of feminists are trying to
push the idea that if a person has sex

2247
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:51,870
with someone that's been drinking,

2248
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:52,704
that it's rape,

2249
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,720
they're saying yes,

2250
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:55,950
they're saying you can't consent,

2251
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,813
including men.

2252
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,890
They're saying a woman
having sex with a drunk man,

2253
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,210
she's raping that man because he,

2254
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:02,010
he's not able to consent
because he's drinking.

2255
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:02,940
Um,

2256
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,020
I think it's ridiculous.

2257
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,010
I think there's,

2258
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:07,680
some of us wouldn't be
here without exactly sex.

2259
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,221
Not only that,

2260
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,440
there's a giant spectrum
of what intoxication is.

2261
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:11,190
Also,

2262
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:16,190
it takes away a lot of responsibility
where you are forced to be responsible for

2263
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:17,311
your actions.

2264
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:18,270
If you're driving,

2265
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,030
you're forced to be
responsible for your actions.

2266
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:22,770
If you engage in a violent activity,

2267
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:24,060
but somehow or another,

2268
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:27,000
if you're drinking and
someone had sex with you,

2269
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:30,600
you were raped the same amount of
intoxication that you would be liable for

2270
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:32,490
driving liable for violent actions.

2271
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,050
Now you're not liable for your actions.

2272
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:35,431
It seems ridiculous.

2273
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:36,264
And it also,

2274
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:36,660
it's,

2275
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:40,110
it discredits women in a lot of ways
because you're saying that they,

2276
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:44,310
they're not capable of forming their own
decisions and deciding that they want

2277
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:47,340
to have a couple of drinks and
fuck some guy because you know,

2278
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,300
women do that.

2279
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:48,650
They will have,

2280
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:50,790
if you need a couple of days where
you fuck some guy just to it because

2281
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:52,080
otherwise you're not
gonna wanna fuck that guy.

2282
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,830
And it's fun and it's Friday
evening and he had a hard week.

2283
00:55:55,831 --> 00:55:56,401
Exactly.

2284
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:57,270
He's not the good looking guy.

2285
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,350
You thought you'd meet at the bar.

2286
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:58,920
Yeah.

2287
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,040
And they're having a good time mean
there's not always a negative thing.

2288
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:05,910
And that's the problem with broad
strokes like painting with broad strokes.

2289
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:10,620
But in introducing this
dialog and discussion and
making people angry about this

2290
00:56:10,621 --> 00:56:11,280
debate,

2291
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,660
they are bringing up the very real
situation of people drugging people and

2292
00:56:15,661 --> 00:56:17,340
getting people drunk
and having sex with him,

2293
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:21,060
which is disgusting and
is rape and is immoral.

2294
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:24,180
So I think even in like when they pushed

2295
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,200
the needle way too far to the left though,

2296
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:27,700
I think that balances out a little bit.

2297
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:29,170
The point is that you sometimes you can't,

2298
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,370
it's like the thing where if you go,

2299
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:30,641
hey,

2300
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:31,810
can we talk about a rape?

2301
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,700
Nah,

2302
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,640
can wait just for a second.

2303
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:34,474
Talking about Nano Tech.

2304
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,180
Okay.

2305
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,013
Okay.

2306
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,220
It's not that big of a deal.

2307
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:39,941
Yeah,

2308
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:40,630
you have to.

2309
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:41,463
You can't.

2310
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,950
And I think this is certainly is
as the culture of oppressed people,

2311
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:47,440
is it the culture of repress being
oppressed in America is that people don't

2312
00:56:47,441 --> 00:56:49,290
hear you when you ask
permission for the science,

2313
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,530
but people don't hear you when you say,

2314
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,560
I'd like to talk about racism in
America and just see if we can finally,

2315
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,670
nobody wants to hear that.

2316
00:56:54,671 --> 00:56:55,504
So you have to,

2317
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:59,440
I love when there's people sometimes
so far because the right is filled with

2318
00:56:59,441 --> 00:57:02,080
people who are so far
on the right and don't,

2319
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:04,390
and they're always like barking and
people can get a lot of attention.

2320
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:06,610
The left is historically
been ashamed of that.

2321
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,660
Like we don't want to
get too loud and we ride.

2322
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,440
And so for me it's like we need
a couple of those people who are,

2323
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:12,130
who,

2324
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:12,950
who make,

2325
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:13,280
who,

2326
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,160
who shows where the middle should be.

2327
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:15,761
You know,

2328
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:16,511
who was like so far,

2329
00:57:16,511 --> 00:57:16,691
okay,

2330
00:57:16,691 --> 00:57:17,620
we don't want to do that.

2331
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,480
But like you said,

2332
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,240
the pendulum has to be pushed that
far to get it back to the middle.

2333
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:22,811
Yeah,

2334
00:57:22,811 --> 00:57:23,530
no doubt.

2335
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:24,340
And I,

2336
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,650
well I don't know if it has to be,

2337
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,750
but it aids in that.

2338
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,081
I think,

2339
00:57:30,081 --> 00:57:32,770
I mean this is an example
of a little example of it.

2340
00:57:32,771 --> 00:57:35,530
Like people will say that occupy Wall
Street didn't accomplish anything.

2341
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:36,873
However,

2342
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:41,020
we didn't talk about the words income
inequality ever in this country until

2343
00:57:41,021 --> 00:57:41,854
occupy Wall Street.

2344
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,040
Well,

2345
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:42,940
it introduced the frame,

2346
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,030
the frame of the 1% and so people
say it didn't accomplish a thing it,

2347
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:51,190
but by going to the parks and sitting out
and getting your bond goes out and you

2348
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:51,371
know,

2349
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:51,761
in a,

2350
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:52,101
in,

2351
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:55,360
in knitting for justice or whatever and
feeding people and giving out books.

2352
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:56,830
Now that is in the,

2353
00:57:56,831 --> 00:57:58,060
people will say people on the right,

2354
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:01,600
we'll say income inequality and the 1%
not realizing that they've adopted the

2355
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:02,620
speech of the left.

2356
00:58:02,621 --> 00:58:03,220
You know?

2357
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:07,390
And so sometimes you have to have
a Tantrum to get some attention.

2358
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,390
And I think coming from a
historically black people,

2359
00:58:10,391 --> 00:58:11,230
we are used to like,

2360
00:58:11,231 --> 00:58:11,471
okay,

2361
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:12,191
we need to have a tantrum.

2362
00:58:12,191 --> 00:58:15,820
Sometimes that Tantrum is inventing rock
and roll and sometimes it's a million

2363
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:16,421
men march.

2364
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:16,750
You know?

2365
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:17,141
It's just,

2366
00:58:17,141 --> 00:58:17,561
that's the,

2367
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:19,150
that's the nature of being,

2368
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,130
of getting attention to
Americans in a press group.

2369
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:21,551
Well,

2370
00:58:21,551 --> 00:58:26,551
it's also the first time ever where people
can uniquely start a movement online

2371
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:28,900
can,

2372
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:33,020
they don't need like an office somewhere
where they hire a bunch of people or I

2373
00:58:33,021 --> 00:58:36,730
need to know anybody or even see anybody
personally who that who is helping them

2374
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:37,564
make the movement happen.

2375
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:37,840
I mean,

2376
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,950
this is happening all the time.

2377
00:58:38,951 --> 00:58:42,130
This climate march on DM on New York City,

2378
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,230
they fucking clogged up the streets,

2379
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:44,600
man.

2380
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:44,990
Yeah,

2381
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:45,760
yeah.

2382
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,451
On the climate,

2383
00:58:46,451 --> 00:58:47,020
nobody is,

2384
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,160
that's not a sexy issue.

2385
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:49,090
Nobody is like,

2386
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:49,270
well,

2387
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:50,021
you know that's not,

2388
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:52,960
but they got the word out and
made people think is important,

2389
00:58:52,961 --> 00:58:53,741
which I believe it is,

2390
00:58:53,741 --> 00:58:56,410
but it's also a thing where it's
like as a person who's like,

2391
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:58,780
I have other issues that I'd like
to see the streets clogged up with,

2392
00:58:59,170 --> 00:58:59,831
but okay,

2393
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:00,040
that's,

2394
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,390
I'm glad we're getting
the streets clogged.

2395
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:01,751
Yeah,

2396
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:05,710
well it's a fascinating time when you
see these movements and they see how big

2397
00:59:05,711 --> 00:59:07,900
they are and right now
nonviolent peaceful.

2398
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:12,901
But the government be sure is aware
that this could also be a large protest.

2399
00:59:14,211 --> 00:59:15,280
It turns violent.

2400
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,830
I can overthrow the
government type protest.

2401
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,910
I mean look,

2402
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:21,560
this guy that just fucking broken
to the White House other day,

2403
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,030
the guy half the fence,

2404
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:23,841
oh man,

2405
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:25,840
like 900 rounds of Ammo in his car,

2406
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:28,760
duck tape and fucking just
climbed the fence and ran.

2407
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:29,001
I mean,

2408
00:59:29,001 --> 00:59:29,691
I hate when it's like,

2409
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,520
it wasn't even like a ocean's 11 plan.

2410
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:32,820
It was like it was just the,

2411
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:36,020
I'm just going to climb the fence and
run and get to the door fucking door.

2412
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:36,883
How many I,

2413
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,870
it's so hard to feel like how many,

2414
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,003
what is happening?

2415
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:40,611
There's got it.

2416
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:42,560
There's multiple levels of
security at the White House.

2417
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:43,700
It's not just one guy who was like,

2418
00:59:43,701 --> 00:59:44,380
I didn't see him.

2419
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,213
It's fucking,

2420
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:46,490
it's not the greeter at Walmart.

2421
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:49,730
Like you know how many levels of secure
have to break down for him to get into

2422
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:51,290
the White House and why is that happening?

2423
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:52,523
Do they suck?

2424
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:52,751
Yeah,

2425
00:59:52,751 --> 00:59:53,331
exactly.

2426
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:53,630
Yeah.

2427
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:57,440
And why is my question in the
era of the black president,

2428
00:59:57,441 --> 01:00:00,580
why does this have to be with us today
sucked in the era of the Bush presidency.

2429
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:00,800
Yeah.

2430
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,710
But I just feel like just take it
more to the same thing happened.

2431
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:06,140
The guy broke into the White House and
got in the White House lawn when the

2432
01:00:06,141 --> 01:00:06,830
Bush,

2433
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:09,170
when Bush was president as well
playing into the White House,

2434
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:10,004
right?

2435
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:10,310
No,

2436
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,860
that was the Pentagon.

2437
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:15,380
What are you talking about when
like are a small plane like a,

2438
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:17,150
not like a real long time ago though,

2439
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:17,690
wasn't it?

2440
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:18,523
When was that?

2441
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,310
Google that shit.

2442
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:20,143
I don't know.

2443
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,470
But hold that.

2444
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:24,470
Shaming the fence and running
and getting in the front door.

2445
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:24,831
To me,

2446
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:27,140
the problem with that is there's
no sophistication to that.

2447
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:28,430
That should be the easiest thing.

2448
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:29,960
Unleashed the hounds.

2449
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:30,381
All right.

2450
01:00:30,381 --> 01:00:31,214
We're done with that.

2451
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:31,491
Yeah.

2452
01:00:31,491 --> 01:00:34,590
Well they'd have to be on point
24 seven looking at for any,

2453
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:35,590
there was another woman that

2454
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,680
got shot recently.

2455
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,050
Yeah.

2456
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:42,200
Then the woman gets shot.

2457
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:42,710
She,

2458
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:47,710
she showed up at the White House and
our car and broke through a barrier that

2459
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:48,590
they,

2460
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:50,390
you said they have to
be on point in 12 hours.

2461
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:51,320
I think they're supposed to be.

2462
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,040
Yes.

2463
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,000
I think that's the Gig,

2464
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,400
but the point is that these movements
that you see like in New York City where

2465
01:00:56,401 --> 01:00:57,290
the clog in the streets,

2466
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,690
that could easily happen
at the White House.

2467
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,000
Yeah.

2468
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,550
That's fucking terrifying for them.

2469
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:06,170
If a million people just stormed the
White House and tore it to the ground,

2470
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,660
stomped to death,

2471
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:11,690
I'll just fucking secret service agents
were holding their heads up to the of

2472
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,160
like that.

2473
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,670
That shit is not outside the realm of
possibility if everything goes horribly

2474
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,001
wrong.

2475
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:17,151
Well,

2476
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:17,331
no,

2477
01:01:17,331 --> 01:01:17,691
not really.

2478
01:01:17,691 --> 01:01:17,991
I mean,

2479
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:18,530
you know,

2480
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,890
Isis is doing a good job recruiting
people right now with some Hollywood style

2481
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:22,431
videos.

2482
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:22,910
And you know,

2483
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:24,740
if somebody in America
picked up that ball,

2484
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:24,980
you know,

2485
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,600
I think that's what the White
House is afraid of right now.

2486
01:01:26,601 --> 01:01:28,820
Is it clearly isis or Isol,

2487
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:29,654
whatever you call it,

2488
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,860
is recruiting from here.

2489
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:32,031
We've got a Middle East,

2490
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,330
not just,

2491
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:33,200
not very many,

2492
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,213
but at least it's,

2493
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:34,650
it's,

2494
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,990
it's stirring the pot here in a way.

2495
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:37,920
Nobody thought al Qaeda
was recruiting firm.

2496
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:38,630
It was like,

2497
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:38,751
oh,

2498
01:01:38,751 --> 01:01:40,610
going to get American people
to do every now and again,

2499
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:41,000
there was one,

2500
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,570
but this is like actually there's a
sense that they are recruited that like

2501
01:01:44,571 --> 01:01:46,130
there was that in that
video that they released,

2502
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,280
there's the one shot of,

2503
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:47,690
of uh,

2504
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,570
like a cell phone video of somebody
driving past the White House and shooting

2505
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,433
video of the White House,

2506
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:52,820
which everybody can do.

2507
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,160
But the fact it was in
the isis videos like,

2508
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,790
oh shit,

2509
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:56,220
it's a,

2510
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:59,290
it implies something that is not.

2511
01:01:59,450 --> 01:01:59,841
But yeah,

2512
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:00,674
I think we,

2513
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:01,280
we,

2514
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,540
we could do that.

2515
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:04,160
But until we,

2516
01:02:04,161 --> 01:02:04,421
the,

2517
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:07,960
the only way that happens in America is
you have to make it seem legitimate and

2518
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:09,020
you have to make it sexy.

2519
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,690
Occupy Wall Street became sexy for,

2520
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:13,430
for a few months if we need
like an ice bucket challenge.

2521
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:15,850
The ice bucket challenge did it,

2522
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:17,773
I'm going to,

2523
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,610
I going to scale the White
House and I challenge 94

2524
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,290
man killed and suicidal
plane crash in the white now.

2525
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,133
So that was Clinton.

2526
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:26,263
Yeah.

2527
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,120
Wow.

2528
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,350
Get it across the cell phone.

2529
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:28,771
Crazy.

2530
01:02:28,771 --> 01:02:29,700
Fuck yeah.

2531
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,310
Goofy bastard looking
at it was porn mustache.

2532
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:33,451
Yeah.

2533
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:35,000
Playing is different though
because you can't like,

2534
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:35,940
oh the plane coming.

2535
01:02:35,941 --> 01:02:36,661
It's coming at us.

2536
01:02:36,661 --> 01:02:38,490
But a dude who's like climbing the fence.

2537
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:41,640
I just seem so like last
minute and not low tech.

2538
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:41,911
Yeah.

2539
01:02:41,911 --> 01:02:42,270
That shit,

2540
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:45,630
that's not well thought out and it
should not be a thing that he got to the

2541
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:45,811
White House door.

2542
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:46,260
Should have been,

2543
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:46,950
I'm over the fence.

2544
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:47,431
Oh my God,

2545
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:48,600
the dogs are eating me.

2546
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,010
Oh well this didn't go well.

2547
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:53,540
It must be that scene in casino when they
talk about the most or ocean's 11 the

2548
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:54,430
most successful bank,

2549
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:54,870
Robbie,

2550
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:59,280
right robber or Vegas Heiss robberies
and it's only people who got to the door

2551
01:02:59,700 --> 01:02:59,911
like,

2552
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:00,151
you know,

2553
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,290
like that's what should happen.

2554
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:02,850
It should be a thing where you get inside.

2555
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:05,580
Well there's more money
in Vegas than there is.

2556
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:06,990
And guarding the White House.

2557
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:07,370
Yes.

2558
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:09,660
Certainly the mob,

2559
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,520
despite his quite as
except still runs Vegas,

2560
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,050
the mob is not running
the White House anymore.

2561
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:13,913
If they were,

2562
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,000
it would be a tighter ship.

2563
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:15,863
Yes.

2564
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:16,770
I'm all for,

2565
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:17,311
I'm all for that.

2566
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:18,630
With no consequences.

2567
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,021
Yes.

2568
01:03:19,021 --> 01:03:19,350
Yeah.

2569
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:19,591
Yeah.

2570
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:20,880
And it wouldn't kill the guy on the spot.

2571
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:22,260
They drag them into the house first.

2572
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:22,451
Yeah,

2573
01:03:22,451 --> 01:03:23,111
they talked to them.

2574
01:03:23,111 --> 01:03:24,450
They have a conversation with them first.

2575
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,850
I don't know.

2576
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:27,151
I mean,

2577
01:03:27,151 --> 01:03:28,770
I don't think in our lifetime we're gonna,

2578
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,650
I don't know if we're going to
ever see like some sort of a,

2579
01:03:31,651 --> 01:03:36,651
a crazy million group of people that are
storming the government like we saw in

2580
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:39,150
Egypt like we saw in Libya.

2581
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:39,900
I don't know.

2582
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,560
I don't know.

2583
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,130
I don't,

2584
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:41,850
I think it,

2585
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:45,630
we'd have to really get to a
strange place to make that happen,

2586
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,430
to get that many people on the same page.

2587
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:48,540
You will also have that kind of,

2588
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:52,410
cause even the tea party and the further
right versions of that aren't doing

2589
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:52,621
that.

2590
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:55,800
They have all the guns but they're
not prepared to do that with them.

2591
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,300
And also there's no,

2592
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:02,010
I mean besides September 11th there's no
notable attacks on America in America.

2593
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:03,510
This Pearl Harbor,

2594
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:04,620
which is sort of America.

2595
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,000
Yes.

2596
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,850
Sort of America.

2597
01:04:05,851 --> 01:04:06,240
Yeah.

2598
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,510
Flying five hours in a plane over the
ocean doesn't really seem like American to

2599
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:10,344
me,

2600
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,490
although I love Hawaii.

2601
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,030
Uh,

2602
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:15,180
but the difference between that and
September 11th September 11th like,

2603
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:15,391
okay,

2604
01:04:15,391 --> 01:04:19,650
this is actually happening in Ameritech
more things happening in America and we

2605
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:21,680
think it's a direct
result of mismanagement.

2606
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:22,590
Miss Government,

2607
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,280
you know,

2608
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,113
corruption,

2609
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:24,953
what have you,

2610
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,760
and people die and you know,

2611
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:29,160
Chicago is blown off the face of the map.

2612
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,870
Some ugly shit could go down,

2613
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:31,400
but it's,

2614
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:31,611
yeah,

2615
01:04:31,611 --> 01:04:32,151
but that you,

2616
01:04:32,151 --> 01:04:32,370
you,

2617
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:34,290
you're talking about
like a post apocalyptic,

2618
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,980
you know like a blade runner
type of like that's not,

2619
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,510
that's not something that we're,

2620
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:40,100
we're separate.

2621
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:40,891
We're steps away from,

2622
01:04:40,891 --> 01:04:42,900
there are several steps away
if we are several steps,

2623
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:45,750
but that's one of the reasons why people
will never give up their fucking guns.

2624
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:46,630
It's one,

2625
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:49,980
one of the reasons why people think
like this shit could always happen.

2626
01:04:49,981 --> 01:04:53,100
I want to be locked and loaded with
a bunch of water in my basement.

2627
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:54,330
Some potatoes,

2628
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:56,410
standby for tags,

2629
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:57,383
bags

2630
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:00,600
with the thing where I can clean
my urine so I can drink it.

2631
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:01,613
Yeah.

2632
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,820
Super Britta filter.

2633
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,421
When is that?

2634
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:04,260
I mean I'm not,

2635
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:05,550
I'm not trying to take
away people's guns away,

2636
01:05:05,551 --> 01:05:09,570
but when has a cache of guns stop the
government from taking anybody down if

2637
01:05:09,571 --> 01:05:10,500
they wanted to take them down?

2638
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:11,580
It depends.

2639
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,560
Depends on how many guns
and how many people,

2640
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:14,730
but I'm saying we haven't seen it happen.

2641
01:05:14,731 --> 01:05:15,540
You know when they're,

2642
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,200
when they decide to come get you,

2643
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,760
you know Ruby Ridge

2644
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,541
or Waco,

2645
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:20,950
they go get the tank with the fire.

2646
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:23,080
That'll stop the semi
automatic machine guns.

2647
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,760
He wasn't trying to take
down the government.

2648
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:26,260
He was trying to bang everybody's pay,

2649
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:26,801
but as I'm saying,

2650
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:27,171
when they're like,

2651
01:05:27,171 --> 01:05:28,200
when they're and that they,

2652
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,310
he wasn't even doing things
that were necessarily,

2653
01:05:30,311 --> 01:05:31,210
he wasn't killing people in,

2654
01:05:31,211 --> 01:05:31,720
they went,

2655
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,340
they were just like get
the tank with the fire.

2656
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:34,210
That'll settle this,

2657
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,110
that'll take care of this.

2658
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:35,840
You know what,

2659
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:40,840
you can't fence in your town and then
like have tanks and guns and ammo and the

2660
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:44,260
government's like that seems a
little too much like a small country.

2661
01:05:44,261 --> 01:05:45,094
You fuck.

2662
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:45,620
Yeah,

2663
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:49,270
we know we're not a bad and I'm not
for the government ruling everything.

2664
01:05:49,271 --> 01:05:52,840
I just think that the thing that you see
in Egypt and in the Ukraine is that if

2665
01:05:52,841 --> 01:05:54,370
people storm the streets,

2666
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,350
it doesn't matter how
many tanks do you have.

2667
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:59,530
People just go and I always say that
like the problem with American protest is

2668
01:05:59,531 --> 01:06:01,570
they have an end time and
it's posted on Facebook.

2669
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:04,670
We are going to be in the
streets until five 30 right.

2670
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,591
Whereas in the Ukraine,

2671
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:05,951
in Egypt,

2672
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,101
like,

2673
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:06,191
no,

2674
01:06:06,191 --> 01:06:07,060
we're just going to stay.

2675
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:08,500
We're just not going anywhere.

2676
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:10,300
And I know that Americans have that.

2677
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:10,660
I mean,

2678
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:11,890
have that kind of follow through.

2679
01:06:11,891 --> 01:06:12,610
Eventually you're like,

2680
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:17,080
I'd like to get home and
watch some Netflix is on
tonight and I'm going to order

2681
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:17,801
take out.

2682
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:17,971
Yeah,

2683
01:06:17,971 --> 01:06:18,231
yeah,

2684
01:06:18,231 --> 01:06:18,970
yeah,

2685
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:19,360
yeah.

2686
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,110
I got to pick up my kid
from soccer practice.

2687
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:23,020
The fucking baby shit man.

2688
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:23,883
Well that's,

2689
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,400
isn't that the goal of being an American
and being allowed to be as soft as baby

2690
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:27,671
shit?

2691
01:06:27,671 --> 01:06:28,840
Isn't that the why we,

2692
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:30,160
why people struggle to get here?

2693
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:31,450
Why kids are streaming across the border?

2694
01:06:31,451 --> 01:06:32,950
Because it's hard living here.

2695
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:36,970
So why we got a two five
terrorism over there.

2696
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,980
It doesn't come over here.

2697
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:43,120
So you can avoid your Chinese food
and enjoy your soccer practice.

2698
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:43,780
Yeah,

2699
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,371
exactly.

2700
01:06:44,371 --> 01:06:44,680
Yeah.

2701
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,580
That's why we need guns.

2702
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,440
That's why we need to get,

2703
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,250
we got to understand the second amendment.

2704
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,111
Second Amendment.

2705
01:06:49,111 --> 01:06:49,570
Yeah.

2706
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:50,381
I'll show it to you.

2707
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:54,080
It was written on the animal
skins collaborate here.

2708
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:54,914
Yeah,

2709
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,500
but God wrote the second amendment.

2710
01:06:56,501 --> 01:06:57,790
I don't think that's how that worked.

2711
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:01,090
The shit was written in the 17 hundreds
and everybody's clinging to it.

2712
01:07:01,091 --> 01:07:04,480
That's the hilarious thing about the
constitution in general that is written

2713
01:07:04,481 --> 01:07:06,160
like this is unconstitutional.

2714
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,553
Yes.

2715
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:08,110
What?

2716
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:10,650
The fucking constitution is old as shit.

2717
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:10,841
Well,

2718
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:12,040
as I understand it is,

2719
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:13,240
I was taught in a,

2720
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:17,050
in a high school American
history class when they wrote it,

2721
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:17,771
they were like,

2722
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:20,950
this will just set the country up for
about 20 years and then we'll come back

2723
01:07:20,951 --> 01:07:22,220
and look at this like,

2724
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,320
this is just the,

2725
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:24,730
we are done with the British.

2726
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:25,870
We've got to make sure
they don't come back.

2727
01:07:25,871 --> 01:07:27,940
So we need militias just
in case they show up again.

2728
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,480
But this is just to get us
started and it became sacrosanct.

2729
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:32,680
It became like this is the,

2730
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:34,390
it became another chapter of the Bible.

2731
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:34,601
Well,

2732
01:07:34,601 --> 01:07:36,190
once the people who wrote it are dead,

2733
01:07:36,191 --> 01:07:39,430
you don't ever want to fuck
with it because then it's
like a religious doctrine.

2734
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:40,300
Yeah.

2735
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,700
And that's the problem is
that it w religious doctrine,

2736
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,920
religious doctrines aren't
religious doctrines.

2737
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,380
They're all written by a dude named Jeff,

2738
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:47,921
you know what I mean?

2739
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:49,420
Like I'm on somebody who was like,

2740
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:49,901
yeah,

2741
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:50,140
yeah.

2742
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:50,561
It's always like,

2743
01:07:50,561 --> 01:07:51,394
I just want to,

2744
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:52,683
you know,

2745
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:53,230
you know,

2746
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:54,041
it's like Chris Rock Creek,

2747
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:54,461
Chris Rock,

2748
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:54,881
bit about it.

2749
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:55,331
Like people,

2750
01:07:55,331 --> 01:07:56,081
like people said,

2751
01:07:56,081 --> 01:07:58,000
God said it because if you say,

2752
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:58,661
I said it,

2753
01:07:58,661 --> 01:07:59,494
people don't listen,

2754
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:00,310
so yeah.

2755
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:00,730
So yeah,

2756
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:01,600
pork will kill you.

2757
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:02,711
They don't listen.

2758
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:03,281
God said,

2759
01:08:03,281 --> 01:08:03,851
portal key.

2760
01:08:03,851 --> 01:08:04,091
Okay,

2761
01:08:04,091 --> 01:08:04,930
we'll stop eating pork.

2762
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:05,710
You know,

2763
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,990
people like to be told they
have authority and I'm not.

2764
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:08,531
And I said,

2765
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:09,520
this is somebody who's not.

2766
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:10,710
I'm,

2767
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:11,480
I'm not an,

2768
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,370
I'm not an atheist.

2769
01:08:12,371 --> 01:08:12,920
I'm not a,

2770
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,870
I'm not anti,

2771
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,190
I'm not anti religion.

2772
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,880
I'd certainly think religion
done a lot of shitty things,

2773
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:18,320
but I'm not sitting here
as an atheist going,

2774
01:08:18,321 --> 01:08:19,970
I don't believe in any of it.

2775
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:20,690
What are you,

2776
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:21,740
if you're not an atheist,

2777
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:23,330
do you consider yourself an agnostic?

2778
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,140
Are you religious?

2779
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:24,320
No,

2780
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:24,771
I'm not really,

2781
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:24,981
I mean,

2782
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:25,880
I grew up Christian.

2783
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:26,750
I feel like,

2784
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,610
I feel like I come from a Christian base.

2785
01:08:28,611 --> 01:08:31,580
Like I like I was black
church Methodist church,

2786
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,420
Baptist church,

2787
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,580
so I can't help but retreat to that.

2788
01:08:34,581 --> 01:08:36,410
Sometimes when the shit
hits the fan could,

2789
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,010
you know,

2790
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:38,150
oh Jesus help like,

2791
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:39,890
but I don't expect them
to walk through the door,

2792
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:40,370
you know what I mean?

2793
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:41,060
Like I'm not,

2794
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:44,840
I don't believe that there is a
guy in heaven looking down on me,

2795
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:48,710
but I do like to think of the
universe as being in a place where it,

2796
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,521
where if you,

2797
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:52,760
if you live a good life and have ordered
that things will work out for you.

2798
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:53,780
And so,

2799
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:55,790
and certainly I will retreat to,

2800
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:56,510
you know,

2801
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:58,070
I like to think that I just,

2802
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,690
it makes me feel comforted to go,

2803
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:00,920
thanks God,

2804
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:03,020
but I'm not going before we get started,

2805
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:03,800
let's have a prayer.

2806
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,633
You know what I'm saying?

2807
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:05,810
It's culturally,

2808
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,090
God has been a cultured,

2809
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:11,090
I've been in like culture
with God and it doesn't,

2810
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:12,770
and it seems to have worked out,

2811
01:09:12,771 --> 01:09:13,910
but I don't want to go to church.

2812
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,811
I don't want to,

2813
01:09:14,811 --> 01:09:17,150
I don't feel a mild form of Christianity.

2814
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:20,360
I have a mom like it's like it's a,

2815
01:09:20,361 --> 01:09:22,380
it's like a piece that you
don't need to take Valtrex for.

2816
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,390
It's exactly what it is.

2817
01:09:23,391 --> 01:09:25,750
I have tried just fine.

2818
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,990
It doesn't usually hurt anybody.

2819
01:09:26,991 --> 01:09:28,460
I let everybody know it's just,

2820
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:32,420
and I only say that because I feel like
I can have the atheism discussion and

2821
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:34,460
not feel threatened by uh,

2822
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:36,870
who have to tell me there's not
a god cause it breaks my whole,

2823
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:37,400
no,

2824
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,560
this is my own in the
same way that some people,

2825
01:09:39,561 --> 01:09:40,880
their god is good,

2826
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:41,361
you know,

2827
01:09:41,361 --> 01:09:42,194
game of Thrones,

2828
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,610
they like think that's the thing,

2829
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:44,300
you know,

2830
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:44,600
that's,

2831
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:48,290
we all of us have gods that we've
defined is like I'm living my life.

2832
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:50,360
Comicon is religion for people.

2833
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:51,460
But,

2834
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:52,101
but we somehow,

2835
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:55,220
if you actually say the really do
don't you just think as a gathering,

2836
01:09:55,221 --> 01:09:56,210
a fun gathering.

2837
01:09:56,211 --> 01:09:56,490
Like,

2838
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:58,250
but that's what religion started out as.

2839
01:09:58,251 --> 01:09:58,760
It was just,

2840
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,090
it was a way to centralize the community
and get people on the same page about

2841
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:02,630
stuff.

2842
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:03,770
And some of those things are moral.

2843
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:04,490
And I get,

2844
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:05,690
have you been to comic con?

2845
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,380
He must've.

2846
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,390
I've been outside of comicon.

2847
01:10:08,391 --> 01:10:09,620
I've never gone into comic.

2848
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:10,700
If you went into comic con,

2849
01:10:10,701 --> 01:10:11,720
you wouldn't ask this question.

2850
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:12,201
I went there,

2851
01:10:12,201 --> 01:10:12,621
I went in there.

2852
01:10:12,621 --> 01:10:13,021
It's,

2853
01:10:13,021 --> 01:10:14,210
it's for real like people,

2854
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:15,740
this is like people's lives,

2855
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:16,640
isn't it?

2856
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,350
Because they get the freedom to have fun
and be a freak because like most of the

2857
01:10:21,351 --> 01:10:25,220
time society frowns upon you
dressing like an anime character.

2858
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:27,170
Most of the time you can't be a furry,

2859
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:28,360
you can't be iron man.

2860
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:28,731
You can't,

2861
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:31,850
you can't just be there and be hanging
out with people having a good time.

2862
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:32,391
Well,

2863
01:10:32,391 --> 01:10:33,051
I think it is that,

2864
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:34,310
but it's also those people,

2865
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:34,760
they,

2866
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,010
they go there because that's the place
where they're permitted to have it,

2867
01:10:37,011 --> 01:10:38,450
but they're living at the whole year.

2868
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,850
Sometimes they're just just
like a furry in their house,

2869
01:10:40,851 --> 01:10:41,510
you know what I'm saying?

2870
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:42,470
But then that's where they go.

2871
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:43,011
It's like,

2872
01:10:43,011 --> 01:10:43,221
you know,

2873
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:43,821
it's like Christmas,

2874
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:46,760
we're allowed to hang the lights and
do all the shit that and it's just fun.

2875
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,670
But then some people also carried the,

2876
01:10:48,671 --> 01:10:49,700
have a cross on their wall.

2877
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:50,240
You know?

2878
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,330
I don't think there's much difference
ultimately between a Spiderman poster on

2879
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:53,870
your wall.

2880
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:55,070
If then across on your wall,

2881
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:56,780
if that's the thing
that you're focused on,

2882
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:57,560
you know,

2883
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,550
that'd be hilarious.

2884
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,350
I Spiderman is your God.

2885
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,184
Yes,

2886
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:02,871
there's certainly,

2887
01:11:02,871 --> 01:11:04,310
and I live in San Francisco where people,

2888
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:08,360
I've lived as her people are hyperfocused
about their version of their life.

2889
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:08,841
Like,

2890
01:11:08,841 --> 01:11:10,010
I want to live my life this way.

2891
01:11:10,011 --> 01:11:11,450
I want to go to this
coffee shop and I want to,

2892
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,080
and I,

2893
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,470
and I go to this bar and I,

2894
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:17,140
and I do leather things on the weekend
and I go to the Folsom street fair and

2895
01:11:17,141 --> 01:11:17,460
that,

2896
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:18,271
and that to me,

2897
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,500
it's like that's your religion.

2898
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,100
You than he,

2899
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,680
that's the thing that makes you feel
better about the world and that's how you

2900
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:23,760
put order in the world.

2901
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:24,953
But you're not,

2902
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:25,291
and you're,

2903
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:26,250
God may be,

2904
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:27,443
uh,

2905
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:27,931
that,

2906
01:11:27,931 --> 01:11:28,231
you know,

2907
01:11:28,231 --> 01:11:31,470
that I'm going to live the
best gay lifestyle I have
or that I'm going to be the

2908
01:11:31,471 --> 01:11:32,100
best,

2909
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:32,371
you know,

2910
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:32,700
whatever.

2911
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:33,210
There's all,

2912
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:34,410
we all have gods,

2913
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:36,330
we just don't want to
put that word on them.

2914
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,140
So for me,

2915
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:37,951
my God is actually,

2916
01:11:37,951 --> 01:11:40,080
I put the word God in there cause I
don't want to be a hypocrite and be like,

2917
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,160
I'm like,

2918
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,990
basically when I went and I met my wife,

2919
01:11:42,991 --> 01:11:45,340
she was a religious studies major.

2920
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:46,380
She was in graduate school for that.

2921
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:46,681
And I was like,

2922
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:47,850
I did the thing that everybody says,

2923
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:48,781
I'm not religious,

2924
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:49,381
I'm spiritual.

2925
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:49,681
She's like,

2926
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:50,514
that's full of Shit,

2927
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:50,961
you know,

2928
01:11:50,961 --> 01:11:51,540
and take us,

2929
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:51,901
what do you,

2930
01:11:51,901 --> 01:11:52,860
what do you believe?

2931
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:53,963
And I was like,

2932
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:55,170
I guess I believe in God.

2933
01:11:55,171 --> 01:11:56,940
But it's like if you say that
people start to get quiet,

2934
01:11:56,941 --> 01:11:58,230
like you guys are getting quiet right now.

2935
01:11:59,110 --> 01:11:59,920
I'm letting you talk.

2936
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:00,131
No,

2937
01:12:00,131 --> 01:12:00,271
no.

2938
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:00,481
I know.

2939
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:01,291
I'm just fucking around.

2940
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:01,740
But yes,

2941
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:02,690
don't see the,

2942
01:12:02,691 --> 01:12:03,021
the,

2943
01:12:03,021 --> 01:12:05,370
the connection between Spiderman and God.

2944
01:12:05,371 --> 01:12:07,080
I think Spiderman is something you enjoy.

2945
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:11,430
God is something you believe in that
doesn't necessarily have any basis,

2946
01:12:11,431 --> 01:12:12,061
in fact,

2947
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:13,310
or in provable,

2948
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,070
uh,

2949
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:14,680
you,

2950
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,980
you can't prove the existence of God.

2951
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:17,640
You can't,

2952
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,211
there's nothing,

2953
01:12:18,211 --> 01:12:21,660
there's nothing that you can
point to in science that says,

2954
01:12:21,661 --> 01:12:22,380
well,

2955
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,490
we can't explain this.

2956
01:12:23,491 --> 01:12:25,860
We're pretty sure that
what this is is God's work.

2957
01:12:25,861 --> 01:12:27,180
But there's certainly,

2958
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:27,650
there's,

2959
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:30,570
that's the thing and I feel
very comfortable and not
because I'm not trying to

2960
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:31,470
convince you guys,

2961
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:34,950
I feel very comfortable and not being
able to approve the thing that is that I

2962
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:36,080
sort of walk around with it.

2963
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:36,631
But listen,

2964
01:12:36,631 --> 01:12:37,261
you don't have to,

2965
01:12:37,261 --> 01:12:37,411
I mean,

2966
01:12:37,411 --> 01:12:38,520
it's a framework for,

2967
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:39,593
you know,

2968
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:40,890
moral judgments.

2969
01:12:40,891 --> 01:12:43,500
It's a framework for discipline.

2970
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:47,270
It can give you sort of a path to
lead your life in a positive manner.

2971
01:12:47,271 --> 01:12:48,720
There's nothing wrong with religion,

2972
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,370
but it's not iron man.

2973
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:51,180
But,

2974
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:51,990
but I think,

2975
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:55,170
I believe that we all know that
there are things that we put in our,

2976
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:55,661
and I'm not,

2977
01:12:55,661 --> 01:12:56,040
I'm not,

2978
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,190
this isn't even criticize them,

2979
01:12:57,191 --> 01:13:00,150
it's just there are things that people
put in their life like I don't believe in

2980
01:13:00,151 --> 01:13:00,511
God.

2981
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:01,470
And then you see that they spent,

2982
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,353
what will,

2983
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:04,800
whatever you're spending the most time
doing that you feel like is making you a

2984
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:05,634
better person.

2985
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:06,090
You are.

2986
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:06,510
That's,

2987
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:07,710
that's your God.

2988
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:08,221
That's your,

2989
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:09,150
that's your religion.

2990
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,980
That's we are inventing our own religion.

2991
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:11,311
Well,

2992
01:13:11,311 --> 01:13:12,600
religion maybe.

2993
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:13,020
Yeah.

2994
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:13,351
Okay.

2995
01:13:13,351 --> 01:13:14,610
Like ideologies,

2996
01:13:14,611 --> 01:13:15,331
religions.

2997
01:13:15,331 --> 01:13:16,100
They're very similar.

2998
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:16,860
I mean,

2999
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,510
I feel like your religion is PR.

3000
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:19,231
You got a little,

3001
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:21,210
it may religion happening
to know like where thanks,

3002
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,440
I go to the gym,

3003
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:23,400
I work out,

3004
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,090
I'm bonding.

3005
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:25,170
This is my community.

3006
01:13:25,171 --> 01:13:26,250
I bond with these people.

3007
01:13:26,251 --> 01:13:27,870
I feel better because I come here.

3008
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,140
There's a code of honor here and a code
of ethics that if somebody violates,

3009
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:33,880
we talked to that person about
it or if it that's that's,

3010
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,630
and I'm not trying to make anybody feel,

3011
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:37,670
this is just my belief.

3012
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,010
I'm not trying to say it,

3013
01:13:39,011 --> 01:13:41,820
just we you have that life that this
is how I live my life and this is how I

3014
01:13:41,821 --> 01:13:42,654
want to live my life.

3015
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:46,600
It's just we've taken the God thing out
of it because God cause people fuck the

3016
01:13:46,601 --> 01:13:46,980
gut.

3017
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,020
People treated that turf,

3018
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:49,950
turned that into a bed and
turned into a shouting thing.

3019
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:50,521
You know,

3020
01:13:50,521 --> 01:13:51,240
I'm not,

3021
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,550
I will make fun of boarding
and Christians all day long.

3022
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,590
I'm not trying to say that
that's the way to do it,

3023
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:56,431
but for me,

3024
01:13:56,431 --> 01:13:58,490
I think because I grew up that way in the,

3025
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,210
like there was a lot of
church around my life.

3026
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,500
I projected the church.

3027
01:14:01,501 --> 01:14:02,340
But I also would like to,

3028
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:03,240
if I'm,

3029
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,830
if I'm running for the bus and I get it,

3030
01:14:04,831 --> 01:14:05,664
sometimes they go,

3031
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,071
oh,

3032
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:06,870
thank God.

3033
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:07,660
And I don't know.

3034
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:08,191
You know what I mean?

3035
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:08,341
Like,

3036
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:08,850
and I just,

3037
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:09,683
and I know that I'm,

3038
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,040
but I don't expect that I'd be like,

3039
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:11,840
I got you dog.

3040
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:12,140
I don't,

3041
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:13,780
I don't expect to see the guy,

3042
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,230
you know?

3043
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,063
I see what you're saying.

3044
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:15,900
Like it's just,

3045
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,421
it's in me,

3046
01:14:16,421 --> 01:14:17,231
it's a part of my,

3047
01:14:17,231 --> 01:14:17,590
it's uh,

3048
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:20,230
it's part of my ethnicity
is black religion.

3049
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,760
It can be empowering,

3050
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:22,151
you know,

3051
01:14:22,151 --> 01:14:22,421
to,

3052
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:23,470
to have a belief.

3053
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:28,120
And that belief doesn't necessarily have
to be even based on fact in order for

3054
01:14:28,121 --> 01:14:28,990
it to benefit you.

3055
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:29,400
No,

3056
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:29,680
no.

3057
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,330
And that's the problem is,

3058
01:14:31,331 --> 01:14:32,164
is that if you go,

3059
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:33,340
this is what I believe,

3060
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:35,110
and I'm gonna sit here until
you two guys believe it.

3061
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:35,441
Well,

3062
01:14:35,441 --> 01:14:36,160
not only that,

3063
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:36,431
like,

3064
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:36,940
guess what?

3065
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,200
I can't disprove it either.

3066
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:42,280
The reality is I've seen way more fucked
up shit doing psychedelic drugs and

3067
01:14:42,281 --> 01:14:44,650
anybody has ever described in the Bible,

3068
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:45,260
you know,

3069
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:50,260
if you go to heaven and it's just a guy
with a harp and angels and Saint Peter's

3070
01:14:51,341 --> 01:14:53,890
really at the pearly gates and
the floor's made out of clouds.

3071
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:54,250
Yeah,

3072
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:58,480
like that would be so normal in
comparison to like a DMT trip.

3073
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:00,880
Like that shit would
be like pretty mundane.

3074
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,620
And I feel like people talk
about proof all the time.

3075
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:04,570
I don't know why this phone fucking works,

3076
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:05,650
but they could figure that out.

3077
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:06,311
They could figure it out.

3078
01:15:06,311 --> 01:15:07,540
I need to talk to someone educated,

3079
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,330
but nobody's gonna explain it to me in
a way that I could take it apart and

3080
01:15:10,331 --> 01:15:11,200
putting it back together.

3081
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:12,070
You know what I'm saying?

3082
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:12,490
They could,

3083
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:13,450
they would just take a long,

3084
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:14,531
but that's what I'm saying.

3085
01:15:14,531 --> 01:15:15,250
But I don't care.

3086
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:17,530
I don't need to know what I'm saying.

3087
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:18,371
I trusted,

3088
01:15:18,371 --> 01:15:19,030
there's people,

3089
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:22,330
there's children in China who know what
they're doing and they put the phone

3090
01:15:22,331 --> 01:15:22,930
together.

3091
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:26,740
But if you wanted to chase that down to
the very origins of the first seed that

3092
01:15:26,741 --> 01:15:27,910
makes the first phone,

3093
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,180
you could do that and I,

3094
01:15:29,181 --> 01:15:29,861
and the same way,

3095
01:15:29,861 --> 01:15:30,940
I don't have interest in doing that.

3096
01:15:30,941 --> 01:15:33,940
I don't have interest in convincing
anybody else about my version of God.

3097
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:35,050
Like as I say on stage,

3098
01:15:35,051 --> 01:15:35,651
when I say God,

3099
01:15:35,651 --> 01:15:37,960
I picture a really old Denzel
Washington with dreadlocks,

3100
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,540
but just that's how it is in my head.

3101
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:41,440
That's how I feel about it.

3102
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:42,820
What about a,

3103
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,760
didn't Morgan Freeman play God
and move in a Prince George?

3104
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:47,680
This has been a few old dude.

3105
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:48,180
Yeah,

3106
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:48,371
yeah,

3107
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:48,730
yeah,

3108
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:49,060
yeah,

3109
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:49,211
yeah.

3110
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:49,361
No,

3111
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:51,070
mine is specifically Denzel Washington.

3112
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,530
That's specifically why Denzel,

3113
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,050
he's like sort of,

3114
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:55,501
I mean,

3115
01:15:55,501 --> 01:15:56,300
a friend of mine taught me,

3116
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,700
he's kind of like a surrogate dad,

3117
01:15:57,730 --> 01:15:58,660
like Denzel Washington.

3118
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,793
I don't know him,

3119
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:00,790
but in the movies,

3120
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:03,160
there was a period of my life
where like I felt like Denzel was,

3121
01:16:03,161 --> 01:16:04,060
it helped me figure it out.

3122
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:04,600
He's a,

3123
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,440
he's the last black actor in Hollywood
who is sort of carrying the baton for

3124
01:16:08,441 --> 01:16:09,730
this as how to be a black man.

3125
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:10,151
You know what?

3126
01:16:10,151 --> 01:16:13,600
I'm saying and that's an important
thing to have in the black community,

3127
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:14,381
especially when you grow up.

3128
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:16,030
Like I have known who my dad is.

3129
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:18,100
I've met him several times
and I'm fucking around.

3130
01:16:18,101 --> 01:16:19,660
I'd know when I used
to visit in the summer,

3131
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,900
but I didn't grow up with a
deal with my dad in the house.

3132
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:27,280
And so I found surrogate dads and places
in entertainment who I felt like this

3133
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:31,570
is a person that she tried to be like
Bruce Lee was a surrogate dad of mine.

3134
01:16:31,571 --> 01:16:31,950
You know,

3135
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:32,260
like,

3136
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:32,800
uh,

3137
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,140
that just showed me that again,

3138
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:37,990
helping me learn a moral code and giving
me an example of how to be an adult and

3139
01:16:37,991 --> 01:16:38,824
how to be a man.

3140
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:39,550
Yeah,

3141
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:40,570
I had the same,

3142
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:43,240
I had a martial arts instructor
that did something for me.

3143
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,920
I did martial arts
instructor who did it for me.

3144
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:50,170
There's this thing about movies and like
having someone who may be even as an

3145
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:54,760
unrealistic depiction of a human being,

3146
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:58,060
like so moral and ethical
and powerful and strong,

3147
01:16:58,061 --> 01:17:00,250
but that that can be empowering.

3148
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:02,140
If you want to be like Denzel Washington,

3149
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,450
you want to get some more coffee?

3150
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,130
It makes them more tomorrow.

3151
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:06,710
I'm sorry.

3152
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:07,850
Let me just hop on a double stream.

3153
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,960
Do Special Magic coffees and got me,

3154
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,873
got me rolling.

3155
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:11,733
It's good shit.

3156
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,580
I uh,

3157
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:19,330
I never thought too much about racism
and movies or thought about black people

3158
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:26,261
being represented in movies until I went
to see planet of the apes and a black

3159
01:17:27,081 --> 01:17:29,180
neighborhood and Philly and,

3160
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:30,090
uh,

3161
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:30,923
the first,

3162
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,930
the James Franco plant of the apes.

3163
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:33,681
And uh,

3164
01:17:33,681 --> 01:17:35,540
I was with my friend Tommy
and his girlfriend Kate,

3165
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:38,390
and we were in Philly for
the UFC and a Friday nights,

3166
01:17:38,391 --> 01:17:39,170
the weigh ins.

3167
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:41,810
So we do the way ends on Friday
and then we had Friday night off.

3168
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,830
And so we want to do,

3169
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:43,160
hey,

3170
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,060
plant of the apes is out,

3171
01:17:44,061 --> 01:17:44,894
let's go check it out.

3172
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:45,471
So,

3173
01:17:45,471 --> 01:17:45,710
uh,

3174
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:46,790
we were in the hotel room.

3175
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,790
We got high as Jesus on the space shuttle.

3176
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,201
I mean,

3177
01:17:51,201 --> 01:17:52,760
we went way too deep.

3178
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:53,720
We went way too deep.

3179
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:58,070
And then we went out to this movie theater
and the closest movie theater was in

3180
01:17:58,071 --> 01:17:59,510
this all black neighborhood in Philly.

3181
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:00,640
And so I mean,

3182
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:01,940
I mean all blacks.

3183
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,070
I mean we were the only fucking white,

3184
01:18:04,071 --> 01:18:04,311
whatever,

3185
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:05,121
America's last few,

3186
01:18:05,121 --> 01:18:05,954
all of them,

3187
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:07,430
but fun.

3188
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:07,970
Yeah.

3189
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:09,050
God Damn it was fun.

3190
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:09,980
But here's the thing,

3191
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:10,400
man,

3192
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,930
when I was in that movie theater,

3193
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:15,080
I was acutely aware of first of all that
we were the only white people in there.

3194
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:20,140
And I was also acutely aware that
every fucking ad for every preview,

3195
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:22,520
every movie was white people.

3196
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,110
It was all white people.

3197
01:18:24,111 --> 01:18:24,711
And I was like,

3198
01:18:24,711 --> 01:18:25,544
whoa.

3199
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,590
But being in that position,

3200
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:31,370
like having that perspective of being
a white person and an all black movie

3201
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:31,521
theater,

3202
01:18:31,521 --> 01:18:31,880
I was like,

3203
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:32,960
whoa.

3204
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:38,270
And being high as fuck made
me super sensitive to it.

3205
01:18:38,271 --> 01:18:42,770
And there was only one white guy that
interacted with a black guy and all the

3206
01:18:42,771 --> 01:18:47,771
previews and it was Jonah Hill and some
fucking goofy ass movie about playing a

3207
01:18:47,781 --> 01:18:52,640
babysitter where he brings the kids
and talk to this black doorman and he's

3208
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:57,641
talking to a women this like really
fucking depressing slang buddy.

3209
01:18:59,110 --> 01:18:59,943
Oh,

3210
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:01,850
it was so bad.

3211
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:02,560
And then the,

3212
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:02,790
the,

3213
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:04,280
the black guy says to him like,

3214
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:05,160
you're a bad motherfucker.

3215
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:05,541
I'm like,

3216
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:06,050
what?

3217
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:06,750
Yeah,

3218
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,510
world is this taking place in.

3219
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:09,560
And it was,

3220
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,030
it was so bizarre.

3221
01:19:11,031 --> 01:19:15,680
Then plant of the apes place and everyone
in the movie is white except the bad

3222
01:19:15,681 --> 01:19:16,310
guy.

3223
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:19,170
He's a black guy who fucking forces the,

3224
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:22,730
the drugs to get into the monkeys and
then the monkeys go loose and take over

3225
01:19:22,731 --> 01:19:24,200
the world and I'm like,

3226
01:19:24,201 --> 01:19:25,580
Whoa,

3227
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:27,350
this is real shit.

3228
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:28,190
Yeah,

3229
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:29,300
everybody should get that high.

3230
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:30,390
Every white person can then hang,

3231
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:32,920
go see and go live in the world
because that's what it does.

3232
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:34,820
Everything you said is like,

3233
01:19:34,821 --> 01:19:35,060
I'm like,

3234
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:35,420
uh Huh.

3235
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:35,790
Yes.

3236
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:37,610
Keeps it yet did nothing
and not surprised.

3237
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,230
Well also that scenario,

3238
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,450
that particular scenario was unique.

3239
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:46,451
It was very unique because it was like
the perfect storm of shitty preview after

3240
01:19:47,001 --> 01:19:49,550
shitty preview and all of
them with white people.

3241
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:50,840
You know Cameron,

3242
01:19:50,841 --> 01:19:52,850
what's her name was Cameron Diaz.

3243
01:19:52,851 --> 01:19:53,241
Diaz.

3244
01:19:53,241 --> 01:19:53,370
Yeah.

3245
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,820
Cameron Diaz and Oh my God,

3246
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:55,330
man,

3247
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:56,710
Da Da.

3248
01:19:57,170 --> 01:20:01,010
And find a man and the black people in
the audience just stone faced watching

3249
01:20:01,011 --> 01:20:02,150
these previews waiting.

3250
01:20:02,151 --> 01:20:04,220
No one's laughing as they shouldn't.

3251
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,800
There's the most depressing thing ever
is when you go to the movies and the

3252
01:20:06,801 --> 01:20:07,980
previous look like dog

3253
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,300
shit and someone's laughing out.

3254
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:10,203
Ah,

3255
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:14,760
we got to see that to see how
Melissa Mccartney falls down.

3256
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:15,511
Oh,

3257
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:16,231
she's hilarious.

3258
01:20:16,231 --> 01:20:16,741
She's big.

3259
01:20:16,741 --> 01:20:17,574
So pink girl.

3260
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:18,571
My oldest.

3261
01:20:18,571 --> 01:20:19,690
When people funny when,

3262
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:19,860
when,

3263
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:19,950
uh,

3264
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:24,830
when it's a stone face like that and then
slowly people laugh at it like they're

3265
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,170
solely,

3266
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:25,980
the audience are still,

3267
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,040
they're not laughing with it.

3268
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,760
They're laughing at then San Francisco
sometimes if people are like,

3269
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:30,421
they're actually like,

3270
01:20:30,421 --> 01:20:30,601
no,

3271
01:20:30,601 --> 01:20:32,640
we're laughing at you movie when I left.

3272
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:35,070
We're not going to go see where
this is ridiculous bullshit.

3273
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:35,904
You've put it before us.

3274
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:36,781
That is beautiful.

3275
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:38,460
That's when you know you're
in a good neighborhood.

3276
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:40,360
Good neighborhood to be in.

3277
01:20:40,361 --> 01:20:42,000
That's a lot of laughter at the trailers.

3278
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:45,510
That's the crowds I want
to perform in the crowds.

3279
01:20:45,511 --> 01:20:47,670
It laugh at the trailers I on Jonah Hill,

3280
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:52,700
see if you could find that fucking
preview Jonah Hill in the babysitter or

3281
01:20:52,951 --> 01:20:53,520
something.

3282
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,540
Some shit like that.

3283
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:55,950
Oh,

3284
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:56,521
so for me,

3285
01:20:56,521 --> 01:20:58,740
I remember the time I off,

3286
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,330
I remember where I just
felt like you just,

3287
01:21:00,331 --> 01:21:01,260
why don't you just let me down.

3288
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:05,730
It was Steve Martin in the movie with
Queen Latifa and we're like some sort of

3289
01:21:05,731 --> 01:21:08,760
thing where she's the Blah Blah
Blah and he's the bla bla bla.

3290
01:21:08,761 --> 01:21:11,190
And together they got the book trailers.

3291
01:21:11,191 --> 01:21:14,520
Just her being a very outsized version
of a black woman in him being a very

3292
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:15,630
narrow version of white guy.

3293
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,650
And in the middle of it,

3294
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:17,783
Steve Martin,

3295
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:22,200
one of the greatest comedians of
all time who has it was on the,

3296
01:21:22,201 --> 01:21:23,790
oh he was in the comedy hall of fame,

3297
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:26,100
does a thing where he
walks through a black club,

3298
01:21:26,101 --> 01:21:26,850
all gangs,

3299
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:29,160
like sort of all gangster
it out in like a jersey.

3300
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,210
And he's walking like
a quote unquote black.

3301
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:31,620
And I'm like,

3302
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:31,920
Nah,

3303
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,120
you Steve Martin,

3304
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:34,830
you're the one of the greatest,

3305
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,270
you know there's a mortgage.

3306
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:37,163
Yeah,

3307
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:38,640
he's got a busy mind dollar house.

3308
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:39,421
Yeah,

3309
01:21:39,421 --> 01:21:40,170
that's the movie.

3310
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:40,540
Yeah,

3311
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:41,640
and see if you can find that video.

3312
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:45,870
We got to see this video
because it's so fucking bad.

3313
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,440
He's like the wacky crazy
babies and by the way,

3314
01:21:49,441 --> 01:21:50,370
I'm a Jonah Hill Fan.

3315
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:55,680
I watched that it all black and movie
theater stone to the Gills and I went,

3316
01:21:59,281 --> 01:21:59,971
Whoa,

3317
01:21:59,971 --> 01:22:04,620
what a cartoonish buffoonish
representation of black
people and this is the only

3318
01:22:04,621 --> 01:22:06,930
one they get to see and the
finding is is people will say,

3319
01:22:06,931 --> 01:22:08,100
why are black people are,

3320
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:09,390
why are some black people so angry?

3321
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:10,440
And I feel like we,

3322
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,970
they did the people in
that theater you then,

3323
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,690
because we have to let shit wash over us
for the rest will be angry all the time

3324
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:18,600
and we will be outwardly like
flipping tables all the time.

3325
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:19,021
If we don't,

3326
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:19,854
if we don't sort of go,

3327
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:21,360
we just got to wait
for planet of the apes.

3328
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:22,740
We just got to let this wash over us.

3329
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:23,370
We can't turn.

3330
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,440
We can't turn this into
a change.org petition.

3331
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:26,580
We just got to let this go.

3332
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:26,881
Well,

3333
01:22:26,881 --> 01:22:27,241
it's also,

3334
01:22:27,241 --> 01:22:27,870
you're not,

3335
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:30,540
you'd never dealing with things from a
neutral point because you're dealing with

3336
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:31,171
things from the,

3337
01:22:31,171 --> 01:22:34,650
the repercussions of all the other shit
that you've seen already before that.

3338
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:37,290
And the thing is is it has
been stated by many people.

3339
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:38,340
Is that in this country?

3340
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:39,270
Nope.

3341
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:42,030
The most people watching those
trailers that you saw aren't going,

3342
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,410
these are a bunch of white
people in these trailers.

3343
01:22:43,411 --> 01:22:43,660
They're going,

3344
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,090
those are a bunch of
people in these trailers.

3345
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,010
But then if you show the trailer for,

3346
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:47,671
you know,

3347
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:48,600
Friday after next,

3348
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:52,050
then it's a bunch of black people in
those trays because white is considered to

3349
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:53,220
be normal in this country.

3350
01:22:53,221 --> 01:22:55,530
That's the white is the default.

3351
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:56,820
It's like on the census,

3352
01:22:56,821 --> 01:22:58,050
which is you upload the census form.

3353
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,630
The first category when they
hit on the race category,

3354
01:23:00,631 --> 01:23:02,130
the list of races is white.

3355
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:03,600
So it's not alphabetical.

3356
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:04,990
It's just white.

3357
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:05,290
Okay.

3358
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:05,710
White.

3359
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:06,521
And then if you're not that,

3360
01:23:06,521 --> 01:23:07,330
what else are you,

3361
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:09,070
and it's like white people are busy.

3362
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:09,380
We got to,

3363
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:09,930
you need to go with,

3364
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:10,510
you know,

3365
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:12,700
so it's the white is
considered the default.

3366
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:13,850
And when people say things like,

3367
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:15,760
like I've talked about this before,

3368
01:23:15,761 --> 01:23:19,090
like people magazine is about
white people for the most part,

3369
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:21,670
but essence says it's a black magazine,

3370
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,000
right?

3371
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:22,211
You know,

3372
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:22,421
it's,

3373
01:23:22,421 --> 01:23:23,080
it's very,

3374
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:23,801
but what,

3375
01:23:23,801 --> 01:23:24,910
and I feel like white people,

3376
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:28,360
one way to sort of put less racism or
is white people have to start putting

3377
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:29,320
white on their magazines.

3378
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:30,130
I have to start.

3379
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,890
If white people got more comfortable
with talking about their whiteness,

3380
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,860
it would make the rest of us not look
crazy when we talked about her ethnicity.

3381
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,750
But sometimes when I go as a black man,

3382
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:38,051
people go,

3383
01:23:38,051 --> 01:23:40,240
well how do you have
to white people can't.

3384
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,190
If white people talk
about their ethnicity,

3385
01:23:42,191 --> 01:23:45,640
if white people say we're going
to have the white actors awards,

3386
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,193
Dude,

3387
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:48,131
well that's a problem.

3388
01:23:48,131 --> 01:23:50,440
Shit would not cause some white people,

3389
01:23:50,441 --> 01:23:51,940
it's wouldn't fly because white,

3390
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:52,900
when people's,

3391
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:53,920
historically in this country,

3392
01:23:53,921 --> 01:23:55,300
when people identify themselves as white,

3393
01:23:55,301 --> 01:23:58,780
it's the clan or it's neo Nazis and
I feel like good white people like

3394
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:01,240
yourselves have to have
to take whiteness back.

3395
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:02,830
Thank you for including me in the group.

3396
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:04,690
I appreciate that very much.

3397
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,690
You know what someone said to
me also is that white power,

3398
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:08,890
like Brown,

3399
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,230
Brown pride is a tattoo
that Cain Velasquez,

3400
01:24:11,231 --> 01:24:14,380
Hassan and nobody came to Alaska as
the heavyweight champion of the world.

3401
01:24:14,381 --> 01:24:17,440
No one gives him a hard time for having
brown pride tattooed on his chest

3402
01:24:17,441 --> 01:24:19,060
because he said he's proud to be Mexican,

3403
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:21,370
but if you had white pride
tattooed on your chest,

3404
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,540
that's a different animal.

3405
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,190
So I said this to my
friend and he was like,

3406
01:24:24,191 --> 01:24:24,401
yeah,

3407
01:24:24,401 --> 01:24:24,941
but you know what?

3408
01:24:24,941 --> 01:24:26,200
You could have Irish pride.

3409
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:26,860
And I was like,

3410
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:27,071
Ooh,

3411
01:24:27,071 --> 01:24:27,904
that's so true.

3412
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:30,100
And you could have Irish
pride tattooed on your chest.

3413
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:30,431
You know what?

3414
01:24:30,431 --> 01:24:31,264
The differences,

3415
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:35,830
I mean average people that have not been
known to be like slave masters and not

3416
01:24:35,831 --> 01:24:37,630
been known to be KKK members.

3417
01:24:37,631 --> 01:24:40,450
It's not like a traditional
background for them.

3418
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:40,690
It's,

3419
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:41,111
it's all,

3420
01:24:41,111 --> 01:24:41,291
yeah.

3421
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:42,011
And I think it's also,

3422
01:24:42,011 --> 01:24:43,360
it's about the,

3423
01:24:43,361 --> 01:24:45,970
there's a nationality there versus white.

3424
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,760
White was an invented
concept in this country.

3425
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:49,721
You know what I mean?

3426
01:24:49,721 --> 01:24:51,100
Like you're in Europe,

3427
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:51,580
they don't,

3428
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:52,450
they think racist.

3429
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:55,000
They don't think racism exists in Europe
because it's all about now it's like

3430
01:24:55,001 --> 01:24:56,230
the French hate the Spanish.

3431
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,100
It's not,

3432
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,090
they don't really white.

3433
01:24:58,091 --> 01:24:58,511
This is the thing,

3434
01:24:58,511 --> 01:24:59,201
we don't have racism.

3435
01:24:59,201 --> 01:24:59,381
Yeah.

3436
01:24:59,381 --> 01:25:00,640
But you still have nationalism.

3437
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:01,563
Weird Shit.

3438
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:02,681
And over they're like,

3439
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:03,550
it's okay to hate Arabs.

3440
01:25:03,551 --> 01:25:04,091
That's different.

3441
01:25:04,091 --> 01:25:04,924
But uh,

3442
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:06,130
but in this country,

3443
01:25:06,131 --> 01:25:07,540
white became this invented concept.

3444
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:11,080
And the reason why white power is hard
for people to take is because white

3445
01:25:11,081 --> 01:25:12,940
people already got the power when he,

3446
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:17,830
when Cain Velasquez attached says Brown
pride is because Brown people don't feel

3447
01:25:17,831 --> 01:25:19,420
like they've got enough power.

3448
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:23,140
And it's a way to invoke a feeling of
power and invoke the thing that Brown

3449
01:25:23,141 --> 01:25:24,160
people who have been shit on.

3450
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,540
And I'm going to take the power back.

3451
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:26,950
Black power came out
of black people going,

3452
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:28,300
we're tired of being shit on.

3453
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:29,320
So we're going to say black power,

3454
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:30,310
white power.

3455
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:31,061
You got it.

3456
01:25:31,061 --> 01:25:31,894
White people,

3457
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:33,940
you got it done.

3458
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:34,571
Didn't fuck.

3459
01:25:34,571 --> 01:25:36,670
And so when the white people for
white power on it feels like,

3460
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:36,791
wait,

3461
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:37,810
how much power are you going to tell?

3462
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:39,820
It's like,

3463
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:40,040
yeah,

3464
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,130
just cause then it becomes about
we don't want you in our schools,

3465
01:25:42,131 --> 01:25:44,530
we don't want black people in our schools
are bumpy when our school like these

3466
01:25:44,531 --> 01:25:45,260
can we go to,

3467
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:47,680
can't we see or we don't want you
drinking out of our water fountain.

3468
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:48,161
You know what I mean?

3469
01:25:48,161 --> 01:25:48,940
It becomes this,

3470
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,470
the power gives so crazy.

3471
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:51,640
But I believe,

3472
01:25:51,641 --> 01:25:52,030
and I'm,

3473
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:55,150
I got a kid who's half
white that if white people,

3474
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,840
good white people actually reclaimed
words like white power and white pride for

3475
01:26:01,331 --> 01:26:02,500
the sake of good things.

3476
01:26:02,501 --> 01:26:03,800
Like cause there's things
you can be proud of,

3477
01:26:03,801 --> 01:26:04,634
you white about.

3478
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:05,361
And it got,

3479
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:08,780
and it became something that wasn't
about neonazis are swastikas.

3480
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:11,120
That it would change the race
discussion in this country.

3481
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,530
That if white people
could sit around and go,

3482
01:26:12,531 --> 01:26:14,060
I'm proud to be white without us going,

3483
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:14,540
oh,

3484
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:15,330
something bad's about this.

3485
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:18,520
No one would able to be able to do that
because if you even say that at all,

3486
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:19,460
you can pendulum shift.

3487
01:26:19,461 --> 01:26:20,780
I'm trying to push it down it,

3488
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,190
I don't think that's
ever going to fly down.

3489
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:26,060
I have to yell out here on the edges
so that in the middle people can go,

3490
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:26,241
okay,

3491
01:26:26,241 --> 01:26:26,931
we're not going to do that,

3492
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:28,400
but let's at least talk about racism.

3493
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:29,000
You know what I mean?

3494
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,000
You could do it as a sketch and
make like a bunch of buffoonish,

3495
01:26:34,431 --> 01:26:36,430
cartoonish white people who are calling.

3496
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,470
We're proud to be why we love black folks.

3497
01:26:39,471 --> 01:26:40,820
I love Tyler Perry,

3498
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:41,361
but says,

3499
01:26:41,361 --> 01:26:41,471
Hey,

3500
01:26:41,471 --> 01:26:42,380
it's not about loving bite.

3501
01:26:42,381 --> 01:26:43,400
It's about living white things.

3502
01:26:43,401 --> 01:26:43,910
It's about like,

3503
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:47,120
I love Mumford and sons quite as fun.

3504
01:26:47,121 --> 01:26:47,861
Exactly.

3505
01:26:47,861 --> 01:26:48,170
Yes.

3506
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:49,010
Too White for me.

3507
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:50,150
That hurts me.

3508
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:51,650
That's what they went so white.

3509
01:26:51,651 --> 01:26:52,670
They went back in time.

3510
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:54,620
You'll notice that Mumford and sons,

3511
01:26:54,621 --> 01:26:55,970
they're essentially white.

3512
01:26:55,971 --> 01:26:57,190
When slavery was legal,

3513
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:58,521
that's what they're doing.

3514
01:26:58,521 --> 01:26:59,990
They're drinking out of mason jars.

3515
01:26:59,991 --> 01:27:01,850
They all have fucking chapter plantation,

3516
01:27:01,851 --> 01:27:02,091
white.

3517
01:27:02,091 --> 01:27:02,840
What are you guys doing?

3518
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:03,770
You're wearing vests.

3519
01:27:03,771 --> 01:27:05,510
You pretending you're
the outlaw Josey Wales.

3520
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:06,920
The fuck are you doing?

3521
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:09,770
But it's very authentic
to a version of whiteness.

3522
01:27:09,771 --> 01:27:11,180
There's nothing about Mumford and sons.

3523
01:27:11,181 --> 01:27:12,014
It feels black.

3524
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:12,351
No,

3525
01:27:12,351 --> 01:27:13,330
it's very worth.

3526
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:13,641
It feels,

3527
01:27:13,641 --> 01:27:14,211
it feels like,

3528
01:27:14,211 --> 01:27:17,120
it feels like white Americana
and that's to me it's like man,

3529
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:18,020
it's a new white,

3530
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:20,990
it's a new white that's an old white
guys don't mean it's a throwback to the,

3531
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:21,371
it's like,

3532
01:27:21,371 --> 01:27:23,000
it's like retro to a time where like,

3533
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:24,440
why are we going back to that time?

3534
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:25,041
Yeah.

3535
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:26,780
There's no black people in those videos.

3536
01:27:26,781 --> 01:27:27,141
Are there,

3537
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:29,060
is there black people in
Mumford and son videos?

3538
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,590
Can you Google that?

3539
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:33,140
It's like black people in
a Mumford and sons video.

3540
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:35,120
Could you imagine if they just
started with them and find out,

3541
01:27:35,121 --> 01:27:36,320
can I be a black guy in your video?

3542
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:39,860
If a bunch of people came to a black movie
theater to see a black movie and they

3543
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:44,660
just started playing Mumford and son
videos before the movie started and people

3544
01:27:44,661 --> 01:27:44,811
would,

3545
01:27:44,811 --> 01:27:46,400
white black people just patiently like,

3546
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:47,481
all right,

3547
01:27:47,481 --> 01:27:48,051
so let's just,

3548
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:48,800
this is what it is.

3549
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,930
Wait for the movie to start it.

3550
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:50,570
Just keep it,

3551
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:51,403
keep it together.

3552
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:56,440
Like thinking of like a movie with
Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman just

3553
01:27:56,661 --> 01:28:00,770
loaded up a little basset greatest
produced by Oprah Winfrey directly by an

3554
01:28:00,771 --> 01:28:05,771
American stars ever in a fucking giant
blockbuster like Quintin Tarantino style

3555
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:07,011
movie.

3556
01:28:07,011 --> 01:28:08,180
Just gigantic,

3557
01:28:08,181 --> 01:28:12,950
huge fucking blockbuster movie based on
the story of the civil rights leader.

3558
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:14,270
Everybody gets excited about it.

3559
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:15,440
Places pack with black,

3560
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:20,450
they just played Mumford and sons video
after and they troll these people like

3561
01:28:20,451 --> 01:28:21,021
they don't get it.

3562
01:28:21,021 --> 01:28:24,110
They play like a half an hour of Mumford
and sons before the movie and it just

3563
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:27,080
starts the black and then a new one
started phase up into a new video.

3564
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:28,503
Oh God.

3565
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:31,570
You should do that for a fucking show,

3566
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:32,423
man.

3567
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:33,300
Do that for sure.

3568
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,580
Just troll the people.

3569
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:35,750
Oh yeah,

3570
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,561
my God.

3571
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:37,580
That would be incredible.

3572
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:38,061
It's,

3573
01:28:38,061 --> 01:28:38,501
I mean it's,

3574
01:28:38,501 --> 01:28:38,840
it's,

3575
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:39,460
it's a funny thing.

3576
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:39,851
It reminds me,

3577
01:28:39,851 --> 01:28:41,210
it was like one time I was watching,

3578
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:44,750
I was flipping the channels and I flip
past like the country music channel and I

3579
01:28:44,751 --> 01:28:46,040
stopped because it was a music,

3580
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:48,860
it was a video that was playing on the
country music channel except there was

3581
01:28:48,861 --> 01:28:49,694
black people in it.

3582
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:50,621
And I was like,

3583
01:28:50,621 --> 01:28:51,080
yeah.

3584
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:51,391
I was like,

3585
01:28:51,391 --> 01:28:52,190
I was like Whoa,

3586
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:53,150
like what's going on here?

3587
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,220
Like why there's black
people in this country video.

3588
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:56,093
Eric's Rucker too.

3589
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:57,080
That's exactly it.

3590
01:28:57,310 --> 01:28:58,700
And I thought that was so funny.

3591
01:28:58,701 --> 01:28:59,120
I'm like,

3592
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,830
oh since a black guy singing it,

3593
01:29:00,831 --> 01:29:02,520
we could black people in this country.

3594
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:04,590
There was a man I was like,

3595
01:29:04,591 --> 01:29:05,041
good for you.

3596
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:06,450
Darrius Rucker for uh,

3597
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:07,940
he's tapped into it man.

3598
01:29:07,941 --> 01:29:09,930
Cause he tried to release an R
and B album and black people went,

3599
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:10,813
no hoodie.

3600
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:11,510
Yeah,

3601
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:12,150
that's the point.

3602
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:13,530
I mean I think he's authentic to himself.

3603
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:15,600
But after Hootie and the blowfish,

3604
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:18,120
he released an R and B
album for black people.

3605
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:19,080
Are you show us Jamie?

3606
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:19,570
I'm,

3607
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:20,403
for instance,

3608
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:21,303
there's a bright light.

3609
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:22,650
Oh,

3610
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:27,400
oh

3611
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:30,220
that doesn't count.

3612
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:32,160
It is from the movie Mandela.

3613
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:35,000
Black James Bond doesn't count
as an average black person.

3614
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:36,480
Get that fucking shit off our screen.

3615
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:38,580
Although I like good looking guy.

3616
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:39,651
He's a great actor.

3617
01:29:39,651 --> 01:29:40,321
He is and all that.

3618
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:41,040
But she,

3619
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:41,731
how dare you,

3620
01:29:41,731 --> 01:29:43,280
how dare you say,

3621
01:29:43,690 --> 01:29:47,580
well how about a big movie that he's
playing and he's playing a fucking guy.

3622
01:29:47,581 --> 01:29:49,320
He's like a serial killer and uh,

3623
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,840
he goes after a black woman,

3624
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,570
like he knocks on the door
in the middle of the night,

3625
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:58,060
tells her that his car broke down at
an awkward time to release that movie.

3626
01:29:58,570 --> 01:29:59,403
Oculus.

3627
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,020
Yeah.

3628
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:00,360
Yeah.

3629
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:00,691
I don't,

3630
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:01,524
yeah,

3631
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:02,310
I don't,

3632
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:03,770
that's why I'm not trying to be an actor.

3633
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:07,020
Not a star in a movie where
like he gets the girl.

3634
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:07,890
No,

3635
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:08,410
no,

3636
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:09,780
no cause black guys got it.

3637
01:30:09,781 --> 01:30:10,291
We always got it.

3638
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:11,040
We always got to do,

3639
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,180
we always got to go a different way,

3640
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:12,811
you know,

3641
01:30:12,811 --> 01:30:15,720
cause if anybody should be playing a
black superhero should be that dude.

3642
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:16,320
But no.

3643
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,770
How about the serial killer first
Denzel Washington got to play.

3644
01:30:19,771 --> 01:30:21,390
He's the closest to that.

3645
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:21,960
That guy,

3646
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:26,960
he got to play like real superstar type
roles that like you would maybe see like

3647
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:32,620
someone else like George Clooney or
Brad Pitt or even he sort of never heat.

3648
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:33,090
There's this,

3649
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:35,280
he doesn't do like romantic comedies.

3650
01:30:35,281 --> 01:30:35,391
He,

3651
01:30:35,391 --> 01:30:35,611
he,

3652
01:30:35,611 --> 01:30:37,380
he's clearly doing it bay specific for,

3653
01:30:37,381 --> 01:30:40,470
he's very hemmed into the thing
whether he's demonstrates choosing it,

3654
01:30:40,471 --> 01:30:44,040
but he's not doing like you don't see
him in like a full on broad comedy.

3655
01:30:44,041 --> 01:30:46,380
You don't see him doing
like George Clooney though.

3656
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:46,771
You don't,

3657
01:30:46,771 --> 01:30:47,221
but yeah,

3658
01:30:47,221 --> 01:30:52,221
but George Clooney always gets the girl
and Denzel Washington is in these movies

3659
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:55,710
where like he was in the Pelican brief
and it's one of those movies where he

3660
01:30:55,711 --> 01:30:57,960
shot him and Julia Roberts
did ended up together.

3661
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:58,500
Bang.

3662
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,333
And they don't,

3663
01:30:59,400 --> 01:30:59,851
they don't,

3664
01:30:59,851 --> 01:31:00,390
which is like,

3665
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:01,680
and I don't know whose decision that is,

3666
01:31:01,681 --> 01:31:02,700
but it's like George Clooney,

3667
01:31:02,701 --> 01:31:03,570
no matter what movie did,

3668
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:06,240
it ends up at the end with him kissing
the girl and then the credits rolling.

3669
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:07,170
That's true.

3670
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:07,771
Whereas dental,

3671
01:31:07,771 --> 01:31:09,090
it's like there's always a reason.

3672
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:09,810
He's always a,

3673
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:11,190
not that it doesn't
always work out for him.

3674
01:31:11,191 --> 01:31:11,851
We used to get them killed.

3675
01:31:11,851 --> 01:31:12,300
Again,

3676
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,090
has disciplined and he
can keep the pussy away.

3677
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,060
Very disciplined martial
artist or something.

3678
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:19,020
Yeah.

3679
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:19,440
There's,

3680
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:23,370
there's a trend going on
now though to sort of avoid,

3681
01:31:23,470 --> 01:31:24,303
wouldn't sound.

3682
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:25,621
What about him?

3683
01:31:25,621 --> 01:31:28,710
He sent a bunch of movies where he gets
to do that cause he's this post he's

3684
01:31:28,711 --> 01:31:29,600
posted in Zell.

3685
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:30,410
Yeah,

3686
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:30,750
that's,

3687
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:31,550
that's the,

3688
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:34,470
that's the thing he gets to do the things
that Denzel either doesn't want to do

3689
01:31:34,471 --> 01:31:35,880
or can't do because it
feels like he can't,

3690
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:37,290
he does romantic comedies too though.

3691
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:38,280
He did like hitch.

3692
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:38,591
Yeah.

3693
01:31:38,591 --> 01:31:38,970
That's via,

3694
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:42,690
he gets to do Intel is the guy who
still holding the Sidney Poitier baton.

3695
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,310
You might want this and everyone's like,

3696
01:31:44,311 --> 01:31:44,611
Nah,

3697
01:31:44,611 --> 01:31:45,180
we're good.

3698
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:45,391
Yeah.

3699
01:31:45,391 --> 01:31:47,520
He's 100% serious and legit.

3700
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:48,570
Even though he's funny.

3701
01:31:48,571 --> 01:31:49,680
I mean he's very funny and movies,

3702
01:31:49,681 --> 01:31:50,371
but he's not,

3703
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:54,000
he just this clearly a thing that he's
walking a path that I don't want to be

3704
01:31:54,001 --> 01:31:59,001
caught up in a thing where
he still holding the baton
of blackness in a way that

3705
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,790
people after him don't have to hold it.

3706
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:03,340
What I was talking about was not going
to do movie where he or you played the

3707
01:32:03,341 --> 01:32:04,600
guy who beats up the black women.

3708
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,321
Like you know,

3709
01:32:05,321 --> 01:32:05,681
like he,

3710
01:32:05,681 --> 01:32:06,160
he's not,

3711
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:10,780
he's not gonna do that movie unless that
dude get some murder gangster and yes.

3712
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:11,650
And he always,

3713
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:13,150
he,

3714
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:13,961
he,

3715
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:15,040
that guy ends up at the end.

3716
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,970
If you notice whenever he does the
movie about the guy who was in,

3717
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:17,823
it was like a villain.

3718
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:20,260
He gets killed or he ends
up at the end broken.

3719
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:23,610
He never does a thing where that
guy goes out on top or like,

3720
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:24,401
like training days,

3721
01:32:24,401 --> 01:32:26,350
a great movie until I think I got to die.

3722
01:32:26,351 --> 01:32:26,681
You know,

3723
01:32:26,681 --> 01:32:29,340
like he always gets a come
up and sit at the end.

3724
01:32:29,341 --> 01:32:30,174
It's a very,

3725
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:32,770
it's a very moral thing he's doing because
he wants to show this is not how you

3726
01:32:32,771 --> 01:32:33,604
live your life.

3727
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:36,010
Do you think it was a
conscious decision on his part?

3728
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:37,360
He chooses those roles.

3729
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,500
He's a a list,

3730
01:32:38,501 --> 01:32:38,681
you know,

3731
01:32:38,681 --> 01:32:38,980
he's,

3732
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:41,350
he is the alias black actor
and he's an a list actor,

3733
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:41,861
you know,

3734
01:32:41,861 --> 01:32:42,310
you know,

3735
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:42,730
I mean,

3736
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:44,080
how many alias black doctors,

3737
01:32:44,081 --> 01:32:45,460
others even 10.

3738
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:46,030
No,

3739
01:32:46,030 --> 01:32:46,691
there's him.

3740
01:32:46,691 --> 01:32:49,560
There's will Smith and
then it's a huge dress off

3741
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:51,983
trying.

3742
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:53,081
Yeah,

3743
01:32:53,081 --> 01:32:53,320
he's,

3744
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:53,891
he's still working.

3745
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:54,011
I mean,

3746
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:54,950
he's in the,

3747
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:56,050
he's a list in the UK.

3748
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:56,861
He's got a list here.

3749
01:32:56,861 --> 01:32:57,471
He's on his way.

3750
01:32:57,471 --> 01:32:58,071
He could be,

3751
01:32:58,071 --> 01:32:58,780
he's a list.

3752
01:32:58,780 --> 01:32:58,931
Yeah,

3753
01:32:58,931 --> 01:32:59,890
he's a British actor.

3754
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,210
He's a big star over there.

3755
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,590
So he speaks with a British accent.

3756
01:33:02,591 --> 01:33:03,424
Absolutely.

3757
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:04,271
That's always weird.

3758
01:33:04,271 --> 01:33:05,530
Like the guy from the walking dead.

3759
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,270
Have you ever heard the director
guy from the walking dead?

3760
01:33:07,271 --> 01:33:07,471
The,

3761
01:33:07,471 --> 01:33:07,660
the,

3762
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:11,740
the Rick ever heard him talking real
life and speaks with a total English

3763
01:33:11,741 --> 01:33:12,191
accent?

3764
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:12,400
Yeah.

3765
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,840
Same as the guy from homeland.

3766
01:33:13,841 --> 01:33:16,360
The red headed dude from
homeland deep English acts.

3767
01:33:16,361 --> 01:33:18,070
You know what I think is
weird as Christian Bale,

3768
01:33:18,071 --> 01:33:21,250
who's British when he was doing interviews
for Batman spoken in an American

3769
01:33:21,251 --> 01:33:22,084
accent.

3770
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:22,811
Yeah.

3771
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:23,080
He,

3772
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:26,450
cause he wanted people
to accept Batman is bad.

3773
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,410
He didn't want to throw them
off with a pretty sexist,

3774
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:29,350
fake accents.

3775
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:33,010
We need specifically when he did
interviews for the movie Batman,

3776
01:33:33,011 --> 01:33:33,671
he couldn't an American,

3777
01:33:33,671 --> 01:33:37,270
he's uncle Tom and for a man cause
don't seem to have worked out.

3778
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,730
Yes.

3779
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:39,070
Yeah.

3780
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:39,251
No,

3781
01:33:39,251 --> 01:33:39,851
you make three.

3782
01:33:39,851 --> 01:33:40,331
Those three,

3783
01:33:40,331 --> 01:33:41,980
three of the biggest
action was of all time.

3784
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:43,190
You know who Jackman too?

3785
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:43,541
Who?

3786
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:44,390
Jack Man.

3787
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:44,990
Yeah.

3788
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:45,910
It's Kinda done it too.

3789
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:46,744
He had been in that.

3790
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:46,931
Yeah.

3791
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:47,530
He sort of dumped,

3792
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:51,640
he brings it down a little bit when he's
never hear that Australian accent from

3793
01:33:51,641 --> 01:33:52,000
him.

3794
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,810
Yeah,

3795
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:53,740
he's an odd duck.

3796
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:54,880
He's,

3797
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,730
he's got a weird situation going on and
he's married to a hundred year old lady

3798
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:00,191
that's going on there.

3799
01:34:00,191 --> 01:34:01,024
Dude,

3800
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:03,670
somebody got to want to marry
a hundred year old lady.

3801
01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:04,480
I am.

3802
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,600
Maybe I should have married.

3803
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:07,651
Nobody's got there.

3804
01:34:07,651 --> 01:34:12,651
Everybody makes their agreements and once
the door closes all up to whatever the

3805
01:34:13,031 --> 01:34:13,730
agreement is.

3806
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:15,020
I like [inaudible].

3807
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:16,740
I know what you were saying.

3808
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:18,250
We could just leave it right here.

3809
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:18,780
Yeah,

3810
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:19,730
I'll need to get crazy.

3811
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:20,351
You need to know,

3812
01:34:20,351 --> 01:34:23,470
need to accuse anybody of anything or
say that something's happened that we

3813
01:34:23,471 --> 01:34:24,460
don't know about personally.

3814
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:25,391
We know,

3815
01:34:25,391 --> 01:34:25,871
man.

3816
01:34:25,871 --> 01:34:26,411
I don't know.

3817
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:26,920
Shit.

3818
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:27,281
You know,

3819
01:34:27,281 --> 01:34:28,960
and certainly there's a people,

3820
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:29,950
marriage is in agreement.

3821
01:34:29,951 --> 01:34:30,850
Handsome man though.

3822
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:31,121
Yeah,

3823
01:34:31,121 --> 01:34:31,900
absolutely.

3824
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:32,733
Beautiful Body.

3825
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:34,330
I never liked him as wolverine,

3826
01:34:34,331 --> 01:34:35,440
but that's my own ways.

3827
01:34:35,441 --> 01:34:36,130
Too Tall.

3828
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:38,260
You're too tall to be built.

3829
01:34:38,261 --> 01:34:40,000
Like Hector Lombard supposed to be this.

3830
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:42,280
I feel like it was supposed to be supposed
to be like a young Robert De Niro.

3831
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:43,990
Not even a Robertson.

3832
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:44,231
Yeah,

3833
01:34:44,231 --> 01:34:45,370
but definitely too good looking,

3834
01:34:45,371 --> 01:34:48,880
but it should be like this
wide thick tank of a man.

3835
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:49,960
Like a wolverine.

3836
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:53,140
The animal was a small animal.

3837
01:34:53,141 --> 01:34:55,480
That's crazy wild and no
one wants to fuck with it.

3838
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:56,314
Covered in hair.

3839
01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:56,640
Yeah.

3840
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,240
It's not to,

3841
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:57,450
yeah,

3842
01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:58,760
it's not supposed to be as beautiful.

3843
01:34:58,760 --> 01:34:59,910
Six foot four.

3844
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,010
He's a little man.

3845
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:02,420
Perfect abs.

3846
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,100
The real wolverine was like five,

3847
01:35:04,101 --> 01:35:05,180
six or something like that.

3848
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:10,130
Just this tank of a little short guy with
metal bones and killed a lot of people

3849
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:11,120
was a fucking murderer.

3850
01:35:11,121 --> 01:35:11,241
Yeah.

3851
01:35:11,241 --> 01:35:14,650
That's funny how that's those claws
in the movies don't ever like I do.

3852
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:16,850
The damage that you would think you
got claws coming out of your hands,

3853
01:35:16,851 --> 01:35:17,041
man.

3854
01:35:17,041 --> 01:35:18,440
It seems like it'd be show it,

3855
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:19,430
you know,

3856
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:19,671
I mean,

3857
01:35:19,671 --> 01:35:23,750
if they could do an r rated version of
wolverine where he's just slicing pizza,

3858
01:35:23,751 --> 01:35:26,380
like they're starting to get the
idea that they can make complex boot,

3859
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:27,450
like they're doing a Deadpool movie,

3860
01:35:27,451 --> 01:35:27,650
you know,

3861
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:28,450
Deadpool,

3862
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:29,070
like they're doing it.

3863
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:31,010
I feel like they're leaning into like,

3864
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:31,311
oh no,

3865
01:35:31,311 --> 01:35:33,620
that actually adults want
to see superhero movies.

3866
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,720
But with actual adult things happening.

3867
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:35,871
Well,

3868
01:35:35,871 --> 01:35:36,680
the watchmen,

3869
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:37,280
yeah.

3870
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,120
But even a more,

3871
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:38,411
yeah.

3872
01:35:38,411 --> 01:35:38,680
Yeah.

3873
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:38,920
Just,

3874
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:39,590
yeah,

3875
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:40,250
more of that.

3876
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:40,820
Cause I,

3877
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:41,653
cause I'm at this point,

3878
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:43,370
I'm a comic book Geek,

3879
01:35:43,371 --> 01:35:44,001
at least I was,

3880
01:35:44,001 --> 01:35:45,020
and I'd like superhero movies,

3881
01:35:45,021 --> 01:35:46,160
but I'm over them.

3882
01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:47,590
I just like isn't explosions.

3883
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:49,580
And then you do the CGI and then you do.

3884
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:50,893
And the thing,

3885
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:52,490
I'm a comic book Geek too,

3886
01:35:52,491 --> 01:35:53,870
I would definitely was when I was a kid,

3887
01:35:53,871 --> 01:35:55,190
I was a huge comic book Geek.

3888
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:56,900
I skipped all the comic
movies this summer.

3889
01:35:56,901 --> 01:35:57,734
I was just like,

3890
01:35:58,010 --> 01:35:58,731
I just couldn't,

3891
01:35:58,731 --> 01:35:59,490
I just,

3892
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:01,550
I the Spiderman movie
with Andrew Garfield,

3893
01:36:01,551 --> 01:36:02,384
the first one.

3894
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:02,841
Yeah.

3895
01:36:02,841 --> 01:36:03,630
This is the second one came.

3896
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:03,921
I was like,

3897
01:36:03,921 --> 01:36:04,281
no.

3898
01:36:04,281 --> 01:36:05,061
And then captain America,

3899
01:36:05,061 --> 01:36:05,661
I never,

3900
01:36:05,661 --> 01:36:08,900
I'd maybe it's not in my DNA to give a
shit about a guy named Captain America.

3901
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:10,941
That's just too much.

3902
01:36:10,941 --> 01:36:11,691
It's just too much.

3903
01:36:11,691 --> 01:36:14,620
Like come on everybody and he
doesn't have any cool powers.

3904
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:18,370
I was so I scored a skip those and
kind of got sent cool steroids jars.

3905
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:18,670
Yeah,

3906
01:36:18,670 --> 01:36:19,290
exactly.

3907
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:20,110
He's like,

3908
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:23,360
he's super steroids or even more so.

3909
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:23,960
Yeah.

3910
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:24,681
But yeah,

3911
01:36:24,681 --> 01:36:25,251
there's a,

3912
01:36:25,251 --> 01:36:28,730
there's a difference between a guy like
him and say like a guy like the hulk.

3913
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:29,151
Yeah.

3914
01:36:29,151 --> 01:36:30,050
I can get behind the hall.

3915
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:30,910
I can get behind.

3916
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:32,900
That's the same thing as
my favorite of all time.

3917
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:33,471
That's me.

3918
01:36:33,471 --> 01:36:33,830
I'm a,

3919
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,611
I was a kid.

3920
01:36:34,611 --> 01:36:37,820
I remember the hulk TV
shows like the new hawk.

3921
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:40,760
The thing about the Hawk now
as they can make it look real,

3922
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,430
like the CGI is so good.

3923
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:44,660
And what's his name?

3924
01:36:44,690 --> 01:36:45,920
What the fuck is the new dudes name?

3925
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:46,701
Oh,

3926
01:36:46,701 --> 01:36:47,170
uh,

3927
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:47,570
the,

3928
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:47,990
uh,

3929
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:51,160
the guy who plays a
really good actor fucking,

3930
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:52,280
uh,

3931
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:52,970
uh,

3932
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:53,120
it's,

3933
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:54,260
I need that pill mark.

3934
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,490
The mark ruffled up there goes.

3935
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,080
Yeah.

3936
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:58,600
He's a really good at and he's a great,

3937
01:36:58,630 --> 01:36:59,840
it was good too.

3938
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:00,191
Yeah,

3939
01:37:00,191 --> 01:37:00,981
I had known it would have been good.

3940
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:03,700
I just think the CGI was not
up to snuff with Panasonic TV.

3941
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:03,930
Yeah,

3942
01:37:03,930 --> 01:37:04,090
Eric.

3943
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:04,380
I think.

3944
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:04,551
Yeah,

3945
01:37:04,551 --> 01:37:05,384
that was a good bridge.

3946
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:05,580
Players,

3947
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:06,740
not six foot four,

3948
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,240
220 pounds.

3949
01:37:08,241 --> 01:37:09,080
Looking at people like,

3950
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:10,270
don't make me turn that off.

3951
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:11,690
You're already the hall already.

3952
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:12,533
Huge

3953
01:37:14,010 --> 01:37:14,811
anger issues.

3954
01:37:14,811 --> 01:37:16,100
He's great and chopper.

3955
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,220
But I just think that that,

3956
01:37:17,370 --> 01:37:19,760
that movie that he was
in was not a good hulk.

3957
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:22,490
And we'll hang Lee and I
think he's a great director.

3958
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:23,690
Admitted he had,

3959
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,640
didn't know who the hulk
was when he took the movie.

3960
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:25,910
Oh,

3961
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:26,270
that's right.

3962
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:27,230
They basically gave it to him.

3963
01:37:27,231 --> 01:37:28,880
It's like you're a big Hollywood director.

3964
01:37:28,881 --> 01:37:29,740
Do you want to do this soup,

3965
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:30,710
this superhero movie?

3966
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:31,340
And he said,

3967
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:32,060
so he didn't,

3968
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:34,820
there was no sense that he
actually understood or cared,

3969
01:37:34,821 --> 01:37:36,260
really love the source material.

3970
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:37,580
Man.

3971
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:38,413
Listen,

3972
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:40,850
sacrilege.

3973
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:41,601
I still feel like,

3974
01:37:41,601 --> 01:37:43,070
just let Lou Ferrigno do it every time.

3975
01:37:43,071 --> 01:37:43,700
But that's me.

3976
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:44,533
I'm old school.

3977
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:47,420
Be The hulk too.

3978
01:37:47,421 --> 01:37:48,560
Fucking small.

3979
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:51,230
But when you saw lord of the rings,

3980
01:37:51,231 --> 01:37:53,420
fucking Gandalf is not really
that tall in real life.

3981
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:53,900
They get,

3982
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:58,050
they can do stuff I gas but just
doesn't look like well I just,

3983
01:37:58,230 --> 01:38:01,590
I just think I would rather a person was
doing it because I just think it would

3984
01:38:01,591 --> 01:38:02,940
be better cause then it's a person,

3985
01:38:02,941 --> 01:38:04,080
it's not CGI.

3986
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:09,110
I don't mind the Hawk being CGI because
there's no real hulk like w were CGI

3987
01:38:09,421 --> 01:38:12,960
looks weird is when it's a
CGI version of a real thing.

3988
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:14,580
Like especially animals.

3989
01:38:14,581 --> 01:38:15,750
They're not good at that yet.

3990
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:18,060
Like for like even in the game of Thrones,

3991
01:38:18,061 --> 01:38:19,050
like you see the dogs,

3992
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:19,620
the wolves,

3993
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:20,790
the dire wolves like that.

3994
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:22,050
It's not really there.

3995
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:25,770
I can kind of pretend it's they're
touching the ground and there's something

3996
01:38:25,771 --> 01:38:26,610
going on here.

3997
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:31,920
It's not just the worst version
was the lions in a I am legend.

3998
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:34,270
Remember that Shit.

3999
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:35,910
It was so goofy.

4000
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:36,210
Like,

4001
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:37,350
oh Christ.

4002
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:41,070
They're the one that I think it was like
when the titanic came out and there's a

4003
01:38:41,071 --> 01:38:41,904
shot where they,

4004
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,330
they sweep over the ship and you see

4005
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:47,340
you don't have any means

4006
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,700
whatever to their knees.

4007
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:53,070
Well it's like the opening
scene in a video game.

4008
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,270
Like when you're getting like,

4009
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:54,510
yeah,

4010
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:55,690
the load screen mark,

4011
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:57,870
the cinematic as a
cinematic where it's like,

4012
01:38:57,871 --> 01:38:59,250
well this isn't the game but this is,

4013
01:38:59,410 --> 01:39:01,020
this makes you think the
game was going to be cool.

4014
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:01,800
Yeah,

4015
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:02,011
no,

4016
01:39:02,011 --> 01:39:02,840
that's a I'm not,

4017
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:03,260
yeah,

4018
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:04,350
I skipped out on the ones.

4019
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:04,800
Yeah,

4020
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:07,200
they're just not quite there yet.

4021
01:39:07,201 --> 01:39:08,070
With Cgi,

4022
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:11,760
we were talking about this the other day
with monster movies that like they show

4023
01:39:11,761 --> 01:39:12,690
too much.

4024
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:15,480
Like the American Werewolf in
London is the perfect example.

4025
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:17,850
You only see that Werewolf
like brief seconds.

4026
01:39:18,210 --> 01:39:18,811
And so your,

4027
01:39:18,811 --> 01:39:22,200
your imagination has to kind of do
a lot of work and it's still scary.

4028
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,210
But now when you see a monster movie,

4029
01:39:24,211 --> 01:39:26,130
you see like minutes and minutes,

4030
01:39:26,131 --> 01:39:29,790
that monster monster and it starts to
look like a dude in a suit or a CGI thing.

4031
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:31,040
And there's like a CGI thing.

4032
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:33,270
Like the I am legend monsters.

4033
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,560
They looked CGI it up.

4034
01:39:34,561 --> 01:39:35,250
They didn't look,

4035
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:39,900
they didn't look like the 28 days
later zombies who are people that just,

4036
01:39:39,901 --> 01:39:43,260
they moved like a real thing that was
really in front of you as opposed to these

4037
01:39:43,261 --> 01:39:44,041
things that are moving.

4038
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:46,210
Like somebody created on a computer.

4039
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:47,490
Somebody drawn this right now.

4040
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:48,090
Yeah.

4041
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:48,811
But that's just,

4042
01:39:48,811 --> 01:39:49,540
you know,

4043
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:50,520
sit at Madec Shit.

4044
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:51,480
Hollywood shit.

4045
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,230
Yeah.

4046
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:52,860
What,

4047
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,870
what do you think about
like Tyler Perry movies?

4048
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:02,120
What do you think about like buffoonish
versions of black people has done by

4049
01:40:02,341 --> 01:40:02,970
black people?

4050
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:03,350
I have,

4051
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:03,720
I have,

4052
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:04,920
I've have talked about Tyler Perry.

4053
01:40:04,930 --> 01:40:05,230
The,

4054
01:40:05,230 --> 01:40:05,970
I,

4055
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:06,421
I have,

4056
01:40:06,421 --> 01:40:07,240
uh,

4057
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:07,800
it's,

4058
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:12,780
my problem with Tyler Perry movies is
that there's not enough black filmmakers

4059
01:40:12,781 --> 01:40:15,990
out there making movies to not make him
look like that's the definitive story of

4060
01:40:15,991 --> 01:40:16,824
black people.

4061
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:18,660
And so it's frustrating when people go,

4062
01:40:18,661 --> 01:40:19,890
that's it right there.

4063
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,060
That's the version of it.

4064
01:40:21,061 --> 01:40:21,570
And you go,

4065
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:22,980
if there was other filmmakers,

4066
01:40:22,981 --> 01:40:23,280
if,

4067
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:23,910
if,

4068
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:25,800
if spike Lee was still like,

4069
01:40:25,801 --> 01:40:26,690
I mean he's a viable filmmaker,

4070
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:27,960
but if there was like,

4071
01:40:27,961 --> 01:40:30,270
there was a point in the 90s where
black people started directing movies,

4072
01:40:30,271 --> 01:40:30,541
he thought,

4073
01:40:30,541 --> 01:40:30,691
oh,

4074
01:40:30,691 --> 01:40:32,670
we're going to have a lot of
major black movie directors.

4075
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:33,451
John Singleton,

4076
01:40:33,451 --> 01:40:34,261
John Singleton,

4077
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:36,930
Mattie rich slightly
predates those people.

4078
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:37,740
And,

4079
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:38,670
but it didn't,

4080
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:39,540
there's not a,

4081
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:43,950
there's still black cinema is still
defined by Tyler Perry and Spike Lee Sorta

4082
01:40:43,951 --> 01:40:45,360
got out of the house every now and again,

4083
01:40:45,361 --> 01:40:46,800
does one of his classic spike Lee movies.

4084
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:47,360
But yeah,

4085
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,193
but it's,

4086
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:52,380
my problem is that there's not enough
choices so that I have to have the Tyler

4087
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:53,470
Perry discussion because like,

4088
01:40:53,471 --> 01:40:54,281
nobody ever goes to you,

4089
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:54,940
like,

4090
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:55,241
you know,

4091
01:40:55,241 --> 01:40:55,421
for,

4092
01:40:55,421 --> 01:40:55,631
you know,

4093
01:40:55,631 --> 01:40:56,500
he's going to sit you down and go,

4094
01:40:56,770 --> 01:40:59,050
what do you think about
a woody Allen movie?

4095
01:40:59,051 --> 01:40:59,441
You know what I mean?

4096
01:40:59,441 --> 01:41:01,230
Like there's not a ton about woody Allen,

4097
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:01,841
but they're not there.

4098
01:41:01,841 --> 01:41:02,330
You know what I'm saying?

4099
01:41:02,330 --> 01:41:02,510
Like,

4100
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:03,101
I know what I'm saying.

4101
01:41:03,101 --> 01:41:03,910
Some VR,

4102
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:07,300
like you're not gonna have to reckon with
each and every Hollywood director is,

4103
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:10,500
it reflects on you represented as a
white person would be respond to you.

4104
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,153
You can go,

4105
01:41:12,190 --> 01:41:12,821
like for example,

4106
01:41:12,821 --> 01:41:13,480
I can't go,

4107
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:14,980
I don't have an opinion
on Tyler Perry movies.

4108
01:41:14,981 --> 01:41:15,341
You'd be like,

4109
01:41:15,341 --> 01:41:16,121
come on man,

4110
01:41:16,121 --> 01:41:17,610
you got it right.

4111
01:41:17,630 --> 01:41:18,071
But you can go,

4112
01:41:18,071 --> 01:41:18,970
I don't have an opinion on what on,

4113
01:41:18,971 --> 01:41:19,450
and you'd be like,

4114
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:19,661
oh,

4115
01:41:19,661 --> 01:41:20,320
I guess he doesn't.

4116
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:20,561
He doesn't.

4117
01:41:20,561 --> 01:41:21,520
Maybe it doesn't think about it.

4118
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:22,240
You know,

4119
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:23,170
I have to,

4120
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:25,300
as a black person
wrecking with Tyler Perry,

4121
01:41:25,450 --> 01:41:26,770
I'm glad he's employing people.

4122
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:29,350
He certainly employs more black
actresses than anybody else.

4123
01:41:29,351 --> 01:41:32,620
And if you're a black actress in Hollywood
and your version is getting beat by

4124
01:41:32,621 --> 01:41:34,120
Idris Elba and a movie or,

4125
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:38,020
or the the Christian mom who finally
meets a man and has a girls club or

4126
01:41:38,021 --> 01:41:39,220
whatever the shit is that he's doing.

4127
01:41:39,221 --> 01:41:40,054
I have not,

4128
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:41,350
I have not seen any of them,

4129
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:42,640
but I get you go.

4130
01:41:42,641 --> 01:41:45,100
I think I'll do the thing where
I play the woman who has a,

4131
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:47,110
who's a single mom living in the hood,

4132
01:41:47,111 --> 01:41:50,290
trying to get a better opportunity versus
Idris Elba going upside your head for

4133
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:50,921
90 minutes.

4134
01:41:50,921 --> 01:41:51,341
So you know,

4135
01:41:51,341 --> 01:41:53,560
so I so I appreciate that.

4136
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:54,730
I used to be very like,

4137
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,440
like fuck Tyler Perry about it,

4138
01:41:56,441 --> 01:41:57,274
but I just sort of,

4139
01:41:57,370 --> 01:41:58,600
things are complicated man.

4140
01:41:58,700 --> 01:41:59,230
You know,

4141
01:41:59,230 --> 01:42:03,490
there's a weird scenario two where he
does things like old school studio style.

4142
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:03,641
Yeah.

4143
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:04,210
He owns it.

4144
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:04,810
That's the other thing.

4145
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:05,620
There's a part of that word.

4146
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:06,610
The business side is like,

4147
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:07,810
he owns his own studio,

4148
01:42:07,811 --> 01:42:12,370
so he literally is making the
movies he wants to make and there's,

4149
01:42:12,371 --> 01:42:12,611
you know,

4150
01:42:12,611 --> 01:42:14,290
there's major Hollywood
directors who aren't doing that,

4151
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:14,900
right?

4152
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:15,400
Some,

4153
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:15,880
he writes,

4154
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:16,571
he produces them,

4155
01:42:16,571 --> 01:42:17,590
he shoots someone is lot.

4156
01:42:17,591 --> 01:42:18,460
He casts them.

4157
01:42:18,730 --> 01:42:19,870
He puts himself in them.

4158
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:22,930
My thing now it's just that thing like
Ben Affleck's got a new movie coming out

4159
01:42:22,931 --> 01:42:24,070
and Tyler Perry is just in it.

4160
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:26,260
Like playing up like a guy.

4161
01:42:26,410 --> 01:42:26,830
Really?

4162
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:27,600
Yeah.

4163
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:28,433
Yeah.

4164
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:30,600
Well he does that sometimes
and he played well.

4165
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:32,260
There was some or movie word Matthew Fox.

4166
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:33,751
He tried to play it.

4167
01:42:33,751 --> 01:42:35,740
He tried to do Alex Crawling
and Alex Cross movie.

4168
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:36,131
Nobody's like,

4169
01:42:36,131 --> 01:42:36,490
no,

4170
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:36,711
no,

4171
01:42:36,711 --> 01:42:36,821
no,

4172
01:42:36,821 --> 01:42:37,150
no,

4173
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:37,540
no,

4174
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:37,990
no.

4175
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:39,140
What's Alex Cross is the,

4176
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:39,761
it's the,

4177
01:42:39,761 --> 01:42:40,930
it's a series of movies.

4178
01:42:40,931 --> 01:42:41,870
Morgan Freeman did,

4179
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:44,560
it was like kissed the girl and yeah,

4180
01:42:44,561 --> 01:42:45,670
there's like one of those,

4181
01:42:45,671 --> 01:42:48,910
it's based on a series of novels and
the caring May and Morgan Freeman played

4182
01:42:48,911 --> 01:42:53,290
the character Alex Cross and then he
basically redid it and updated it and he

4183
01:42:53,291 --> 01:42:53,561
was playing,

4184
01:42:53,561 --> 01:42:54,570
the main character is,

4185
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:57,640
I think it's called Alex
Cross box was in it.

4186
01:42:57,641 --> 01:42:57,941
Yeah.

4187
01:42:57,941 --> 01:42:59,180
I didn't know it was based on something.

4188
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:01,030
That's what they're trying to do.

4189
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:03,400
An established property
that has been a hit movie.

4190
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:07,360
We're going to Redo it with Tyler Perry
and bring his audience in and have a new

4191
01:43:07,361 --> 01:43:07,931
franchise.

4192
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:12,280
But nobody bought Tyler Perry as a
serious dramatic sort of thriller guy.

4193
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:12,791
Huh?

4194
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:17,380
I mean it would have been better if it
was Medea as Alex Cross gone girl is the

4195
01:43:17,381 --> 01:43:17,831
new younger.

4196
01:43:17,831 --> 01:43:18,011
Yeah.

4197
01:43:18,011 --> 01:43:19,000
And Tyler prayer's just in it.

4198
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:19,660
What is it?

4199
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,520
What is gone girl Affleck movie.

4200
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:22,031
Yeah.

4201
01:43:22,031 --> 01:43:22,690
It's getting a lot of,

4202
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:24,610
it's going to be the new money
we are all talking about.

4203
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:25,473
You know,

4204
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:26,381
whether you see it or not,

4205
01:43:26,381 --> 01:43:26,701
it's going to be,

4206
01:43:26,701 --> 01:43:27,534
what is it about,

4207
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:28,893
I don't know.

4208
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:31,920
Oh it's a kid that's
basically his darkness,

4209
01:43:31,930 --> 01:43:34,630
kidnapped or something and
Tyler praise just in it.

4210
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:35,670
Just as,

4211
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:37,600
I just feel like it's a
little bit hard for me to,

4212
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:38,341
how the fuck is,

4213
01:43:38,341 --> 01:43:40,030
you have time to do all that shit.

4214
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:40,923
He's got that,

4215
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:41,650
you know,

4216
01:43:41,650 --> 01:43:42,483
he's,

4217
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:45,160
I think you can't be
that guy without being,

4218
01:43:45,161 --> 01:43:46,870
and I say this in the best way possible.

4219
01:43:46,871 --> 01:43:47,704
A hustler,

4220
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:48,281
you know,

4221
01:43:48,281 --> 01:43:48,881
you can't be,

4222
01:43:48,881 --> 01:43:52,520
you can't have gotten to the point that
he's at without sort of like making time

4223
01:43:52,521 --> 01:43:53,900
to do as many things as you can do.

4224
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:56,690
Cause he's someone who was living out
of his car and doing plays and Baptist

4225
01:43:56,691 --> 01:43:57,620
churches or something.

4226
01:43:57,621 --> 01:43:59,240
And so yeah,

4227
01:43:59,241 --> 01:44:01,610
that's where he's to heat
the things he did in movies.

4228
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:05,420
Started out his plays that he did in
like community centers and pride church

4229
01:44:05,421 --> 01:44:05,991
basements.

4230
01:44:05,991 --> 01:44:08,780
And he built them up to the thing that
you'd go to the Apollo and see a Tyler

4231
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:10,310
Perry play like black theater,

4232
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:11,653
urban black theater.

4233
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:13,280
Does he have a hundred year old wife too,

4234
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:14,173
if you know what I'm saying?

4235
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:17,960
He's got agreements.

4236
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:21,380
I'm sure it's got a great
range that's like he's not,

4237
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:22,610
he's not married.

4238
01:44:22,611 --> 01:44:27,611
He doesn't have any children
taking mom to the movie openings,

4239
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:30,090
homophobic conversation without

4240
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:33,280
being homophobic.

4241
01:44:33,281 --> 01:44:34,114
I'm just,

4242
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:35,990
I'm just telling you about the dude.

4243
01:44:35,991 --> 01:44:38,180
He takes his mom to the premieres.

4244
01:44:38,181 --> 01:44:39,710
I don't have nothing wrong with that.

4245
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:40,461
Whatever he is,

4246
01:44:40,461 --> 01:44:40,651
he's,

4247
01:44:40,651 --> 01:44:41,810
he's successful at it.

4248
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:43,460
He's like a nice guy.

4249
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:43,671
Yeah.

4250
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:44,750
There's been no scandal,

4251
01:44:44,751 --> 01:44:46,550
so we can't be mad at
him for any friendly,

4252
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,450
it seems friendly,

4253
01:44:47,451 --> 01:44:47,870
you know,

4254
01:44:47,870 --> 01:44:49,820
get aggressive and angry
at people for no reason.

4255
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:51,531
Like the other blacks,

4256
01:44:51,531 --> 01:44:52,220
is that what you're saying?

4257
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:53,000
That's what I'm saying.

4258
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:53,331
Oh yeah.

4259
01:44:53,331 --> 01:44:53,840
He's one of the,

4260
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:54,770
he's one of the good ones.

4261
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:56,060
He's not like the others.

4262
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:58,040
Jamie and I being one of
the good white people,

4263
01:44:58,070 --> 01:44:59,900
we like to point out some
of the good black people.

4264
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:00,081
Oh,

4265
01:45:00,081 --> 01:45:00,470
thank you.

4266
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:01,303
Thank you.

4267
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:03,470
And he's also very articulate.

4268
01:45:03,471 --> 01:45:04,340
I don't know if you noticed that.

4269
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:05,263
He speaks so well.

4270
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:06,280
I don't notice color.

4271
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:08,160
Oh,

4272
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:08,421
thanks.

4273
01:45:08,421 --> 01:45:09,550
That's one of those people.

4274
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:10,020
Thanks.

4275
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:10,880
That's very helpful.

4276
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:13,730
It's helpful to living in America.

4277
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:14,960
A white person who doesn't see color.

4278
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:16,551
I don't see it.

4279
01:45:16,551 --> 01:45:17,520
I just benefit from,

4280
01:45:18,510 --> 01:45:19,343
yeah,

4281
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:20,121
I don't see gender.

4282
01:45:20,121 --> 01:45:23,630
I don't see notice white privilege
because I didn't even notice that I'm

4283
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:23,960
whining.

4284
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:24,793
Awesome.

4285
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:28,490
Just like I don't notice that
I'm six foot four all the time.

4286
01:45:28,491 --> 01:45:29,320
It just Saturday just,

4287
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:31,910
I just looked down and this
seems to be where everything,

4288
01:45:31,911 --> 01:45:32,990
I can reach everything.

4289
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,100
I don't ever have to stay.

4290
01:45:34,101 --> 01:45:35,140
Get a step stool.

4291
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:35,900
Yeah.

4292
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:37,580
I can always see over
people at the concerts.

4293
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:38,140
It's great.

4294
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:38,880
I've got a long reach.

4295
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:39,520
If you want a box.

4296
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:39,740
Yeah.

4297
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:40,011
I got,

4298
01:45:40,011 --> 01:45:40,491
I got high.

4299
01:45:40,491 --> 01:45:41,301
I got high privileged,

4300
01:45:41,301 --> 01:45:42,134
but I don't notice it.

4301
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:42,501
Height,

4302
01:45:42,501 --> 01:45:43,550
privilege and different things.

4303
01:45:43,551 --> 01:45:44,480
I used to be short,

4304
01:45:44,481 --> 01:45:45,111
so I had no where.

4305
01:45:45,111 --> 01:45:46,580
I can know how short people feel.

4306
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:47,740
Didn't used to be.

4307
01:45:47,740 --> 01:45:48,290
You didn't grow.

4308
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:50,300
You weren't black and and
grew up into whiteness.

4309
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:51,111
That's true.

4310
01:45:51,111 --> 01:45:51,800
That's good point.

4311
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:52,080
Yeah.

4312
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:52,420
That's what,

4313
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:53,030
that's how I feel about,

4314
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:53,300
yeah.

4315
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:53,691
But no,

4316
01:45:53,691 --> 01:45:54,800
I was short until I was,

4317
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:55,340
I mean,

4318
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:57,290
whatever the definition of
short is till high school.

4319
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:02,150
You started getting tweeted when I was
involved in this conversation with a lot

4320
01:46:02,151 --> 01:46:06,650
of people about racism
and Jon Jones and uh,

4321
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:07,250
you,

4322
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,540
you were chiming in about it and uh,

4323
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:11,660
that was a weird conversation.

4324
01:46:11,661 --> 01:46:12,494
Not,

4325
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,420
not because uh,

4326
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:16,310
the idea that uh,

4327
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,090
people being racist against a,

4328
01:46:18,091 --> 01:46:18,950
a young fighter.

4329
01:46:18,951 --> 01:46:23,951
Like when you see a guy that's doing very
well and has a lot of success and then

4330
01:46:25,341 --> 01:46:28,040
you see a lot of blow back
and people criticizing him,

4331
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,920
I always wonder like what is
it that they're criticizing?

4332
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:32,480
They're criticizing his personal life,

4333
01:46:32,481 --> 01:46:33,021
his behavior.

4334
01:46:33,021 --> 01:46:34,310
Like what is he doing that's so terrible.

4335
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:34,570
Yeah.

4336
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:35,130
Like what,

4337
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:35,870
what is it,

4338
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:36,980
how much of that is racism?

4339
01:46:36,981 --> 01:46:41,220
And when I said how much
of that is racism shit?

4340
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:43,130
Yeah.

4341
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:43,911
I said,

4342
01:46:43,911 --> 01:46:45,440
I wonder how much of that is racism.

4343
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:48,050
And then I also said I think he'd
be more popular if he was white.

4344
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:51,750
And people like you were saying that we
don't like him cause we were like people

4345
01:46:51,751 --> 01:46:52,584
made these,

4346
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:54,720
these big jumps in big conclusions.

4347
01:46:54,721 --> 01:46:58,260
It's like are you saying that he
wouldn't be more popular if he was white?

4348
01:46:58,350 --> 01:47:02,010
Cause I think that's ridiculous because
there's more white people than there are

4349
01:47:02,011 --> 01:47:04,740
black people and white people
tend to associate white people.

4350
01:47:04,770 --> 01:47:06,060
They want white hero.

4351
01:47:06,070 --> 01:47:07,170
We like to see ourselves.

4352
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,390
Yes and that's true of all people.

4353
01:47:09,391 --> 01:47:09,871
We like to see,

4354
01:47:09,871 --> 01:47:11,550
we'd like to see ourselves
reflected outside of our,

4355
01:47:11,551 --> 01:47:15,450
so I don't even think that's saying
that he's not more popular because of

4356
01:47:15,451 --> 01:47:15,990
racism.

4357
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:17,850
I think that's like a
racial preference thing.

4358
01:47:18,210 --> 01:47:20,160
But asking the question,

4359
01:47:20,370 --> 01:47:22,470
I wonder if a lot of the blowback,

4360
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,390
a lot of the reason why
people don't like him,

4361
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:27,120
his racism and I was,

4362
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:28,680
I was a little taken aback.

4363
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:30,240
It was a front page and saw that.

4364
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:32,610
I saw that now and that's why
I chimed in because I was like,

4365
01:47:32,910 --> 01:47:33,450
I felt like,

4366
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:36,570
oh Joe is experiencing something that
I experienced all the time when the in

4367
01:47:36,571 --> 01:47:38,880
these discussions and that's why I sort
of reached out like I was trying to

4368
01:47:38,881 --> 01:47:39,241
reach and go,

4369
01:47:39,241 --> 01:47:39,930
hey man,

4370
01:47:39,930 --> 01:47:40,351
thank you.

4371
01:47:40,351 --> 01:47:41,160
I know what you're doing.

4372
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:43,200
I know what's happening
here and I'm a white guy,

4373
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:44,340
so it's hilarious.

4374
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:45,750
Hilarious.

4375
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:45,901
Well,

4376
01:47:45,901 --> 01:47:48,480
it's worse because you people
acted like you turned trader.

4377
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,333
Racism is,

4378
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:53,580
is that people who would not describe
themselves as white people felt like you

4379
01:47:53,581 --> 01:47:56,640
turned on them because you brought
up race or people were saying,

4380
01:47:56,641 --> 01:47:57,920
fuck you there.

4381
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,330
They were tweeting me like
some really mean shit.

4382
01:48:00,331 --> 01:48:00,631
I was like,

4383
01:48:00,631 --> 01:48:00,811
well,

4384
01:48:00,811 --> 01:48:02,580
did you even listen to what I said?

4385
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:03,990
Because people didn't even listen.

4386
01:48:03,991 --> 01:48:07,230
They didn't even know they saw it on
print somewhere and then it was on the

4387
01:48:07,231 --> 01:48:09,490
cover of like a bunch
of different news app,

4388
01:48:09,491 --> 01:48:14,490
let's say Joe Rogan attributes Jon
Jones a lack of success to racism.

4389
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:15,180
Yes.

4390
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:19,170
All I said was that I wonder,

4391
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:20,183
I wonder,

4392
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:23,580
I wonder how much of it
is racism a similar thing.

4393
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:24,660
Much smaller happen to me.

4394
01:48:24,661 --> 01:48:25,890
Recently I wrote a,

4395
01:48:25,891 --> 01:48:26,550
I saw it.

4396
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:26,691
Yeah.

4397
01:48:26,691 --> 01:48:29,010
The buzzfeed buzzfeed
reached out to me and said,

4398
01:48:29,011 --> 01:48:31,320
do you want to write a thing about
lack of diversity in late night?

4399
01:48:31,770 --> 01:48:33,560
I would been there like you
may be over talking about it.

4400
01:48:33,561 --> 01:48:33,650
Good.

4401
01:48:33,650 --> 01:48:34,411
Not write a thing about it.

4402
01:48:34,411 --> 01:48:36,450
I got things to say about
it and my thing was,

4403
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:37,290
it's true.

4404
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:41,550
I noticed you can't say it's not white
and late night white and male cause they

4405
01:48:41,551 --> 01:48:42,151
want to make it white.

4406
01:48:42,151 --> 01:48:42,361
I was like,

4407
01:48:42,361 --> 01:48:42,481
no,

4408
01:48:42,481 --> 01:48:43,231
it's white and male.

4409
01:48:43,231 --> 01:48:47,140
Let's be real and but my thing is
I'm not worried about late night.

4410
01:48:47,170 --> 01:48:47,701
I'm not trying to,

4411
01:48:47,701 --> 01:48:51,690
we need to stop focusing on getting a
diversity in late night and the rest of us

4412
01:48:51,691 --> 01:48:52,021
need to do.

4413
01:48:52,021 --> 01:48:55,470
We always do find our own projects and
create our own way and stop being the

4414
01:48:55,471 --> 01:48:55,800
way,

4415
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:58,950
the way that this is a reaction to
late night talk show that you like,

4416
01:48:58,951 --> 01:48:59,790
I want to just talk.

4417
01:48:59,791 --> 01:49:00,780
I don't want to have to do a skit.

4418
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:02,550
So,

4419
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:06,000
and then the Hollywood
reporter said to Debbie,

4420
01:49:06,010 --> 01:49:06,511
come out bill.

4421
01:49:06,511 --> 01:49:07,344
Their headline was,

4422
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:09,180
it's time for a black host in late night.

4423
01:49:09,190 --> 01:49:09,540
Yes,

4424
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:10,231
I saw that.

4425
01:49:10,231 --> 01:49:10,860
I was like,

4426
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:11,870
that's not what you said.

4427
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:14,490
How when I say love your tweet to it too,

4428
01:49:14,910 --> 01:49:15,590
you said,

4429
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:15,891
Eh,

4430
01:49:15,891 --> 01:49:17,460
it's funny when I say,

4431
01:49:17,461 --> 01:49:20,490
did you ever notice people
here because people here,

4432
01:49:20,491 --> 01:49:21,810
everything you know and love is wrong.

4433
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,380
And that's the same thing
you found out is when you go,

4434
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:26,850
I wonder people here,

4435
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:28,140
you're a racist.

4436
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:29,790
But I thought it was particularly,

4437
01:49:29,791 --> 01:49:32,580
it was particularly shocking
to me because I'm a white guy

4438
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:34,771
and I'm saying,

4439
01:49:34,771 --> 01:49:37,860
I wonder how much of it is racism because
are we pretending that racism isn't

4440
01:49:37,890 --> 01:49:38,480
real?

4441
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:41,100
It's 300 fucking 50 million
people in this country,

4442
01:49:41,101 --> 01:49:41,550
right?

4443
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:44,040
If there's 300 plus million
people in this country,

4444
01:49:44,190 --> 01:49:45,410
what percentage are racist?

4445
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:48,100
If it's 1% let's say it's 1%

4446
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:51,190
we have more than 3 million racists.

4447
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:51,820
Okay.

4448
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:56,820
We know it's more than 1% so what
percentage has a hard time dealing with a

4449
01:49:56,861 --> 01:50:01,861
dominant male athlete in a combat sport
that beats the fuck out of everybody and

4450
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:04,330
is like young and brash.

4451
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:08,720
So has the thing that there
been comparisons of John
Jones to Ali young only in

4452
01:50:08,730 --> 01:50:11,580
this he has the same thing all he had
where he's considered to be an outsider to

4453
01:50:11,581 --> 01:50:12,414
the sport.

4454
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:15,150
You know that there's a thing with Jon
Jones where it's like he came there,

4455
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:16,860
the stuff I've heard about
Jon Jones is that he's,

4456
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:18,780
he's unorthodox or he's not,

4457
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:21,540
he didn't come up the way he
learned on youtube videos.

4458
01:50:21,541 --> 01:50:22,100
There's sort of this,

4459
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:22,570
this,

4460
01:50:22,570 --> 01:50:24,150
this legend that has
been created about him,

4461
01:50:24,151 --> 01:50:26,310
about like that he's not that the sport,

4462
01:50:26,670 --> 01:50:27,810
but he's not a guy like,

4463
01:50:27,811 --> 01:50:28,410
uh,

4464
01:50:28,410 --> 01:50:31,680
I dunno like you think about like a
George Saint Pierre George Saint Pierre.

4465
01:50:31,681 --> 01:50:31,831
No,

4466
01:50:31,831 --> 01:50:32,910
I'm thinking of the black guy.

4467
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,110
The guy had Jon Jones,

4468
01:50:34,111 --> 01:50:37,470
they were friends and then he'd beat her
shot Rashad Evans who sorta was raised

4469
01:50:37,471 --> 01:50:39,510
by the sport through the ultimate fighter.

4470
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:41,220
And so people got to see him sort of like,

4471
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:44,330
people got to feel like I saw
that guy on the TV show and now,

4472
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:45,480
now he's our champion.

4473
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:49,680
Whereas John Jones sort of came from the
outside and very quickly dominated and

4474
01:50:49,681 --> 01:50:50,820
that threatens people sometimes

4475
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:51,300
to,

4476
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:53,230
well he actually see,

4477
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:57,120
there's a misconception when it comes to
martial arts and one of the big ones is

4478
01:50:57,121 --> 01:50:58,710
that wrestling is not a martial art.

4479
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:03,210
John was a very successful wrestler all
throughout high school and college and

4480
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:06,420
that is probably the most
important martial art.

4481
01:51:06,630 --> 01:51:09,600
The ability to dictate where the
fight takes place is probably the most

4482
01:51:09,601 --> 01:51:10,860
important aspect of fighting.

4483
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,920
And John was an outstanding wrestler and
the only reason why he didn't go on to

4484
01:51:13,921 --> 01:51:14,880
be a college star,

4485
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,340
because he got his girlfriend
pregnant and had to get a job.

4486
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:19,110
That is why he got,

4487
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:23,520
but he was being actively recruited by a
bunch of different universities because

4488
01:51:23,521 --> 01:51:24,780
he was a very talented wrestler.

4489
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:27,060
And then on top of that,

4490
01:51:27,150 --> 01:51:31,230
he grew up with two fucking
giant super athlete brothers.

4491
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:33,390
And he used to Duke it out all the time.

4492
01:51:33,690 --> 01:51:35,970
Like John's parents would
laugh about how their,

4493
01:51:35,971 --> 01:51:36,211
their,

4494
01:51:36,211 --> 01:51:38,700
their kids would just wrestle
and fight in the living room.

4495
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:40,260
And that is a reality.

4496
01:51:40,261 --> 01:51:41,700
If you grew up with big brothers,

4497
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:44,650
you can use to combat in the
household on a daily fucking base.

4498
01:51:44,651 --> 01:51:45,750
You got to fight for cereal.

4499
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:48,660
Like this fucking dude
took your basketball,

4500
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:49,260
someone,

4501
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:49,591
you know,

4502
01:51:49,591 --> 01:51:50,580
someone's got your shit,

4503
01:51:50,610 --> 01:51:53,100
you got to Duke it out and got
a flight to go to the bathroom.

4504
01:51:53,101 --> 01:51:53,430
You to,

4505
01:51:53,430 --> 01:51:53,760
yeah.

4506
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,230
And even if it's not a real fight,

4507
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:57,810
there's competition like
high level competition.

4508
01:51:57,811 --> 01:51:59,640
So when he came out of nowhere,

4509
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:03,870
he was still a very good athlete
and a very good wrestler.

4510
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:06,420
And wrestling is a hugely
important martial art.

4511
01:52:06,510 --> 01:52:11,510
So it's no more unusual than a guy who's
a worldclass kickboxer who enters into

4512
01:52:11,881 --> 01:52:12,241
MMA,

4513
01:52:12,241 --> 01:52:13,440
starts knocking people out.

4514
01:52:13,441 --> 01:52:13,801
That's Kinda,

4515
01:52:13,801 --> 01:52:14,970
it's Kinda to be expected.

4516
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:16,710
So I think that's just a mistake.

4517
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:17,451
Yeah.

4518
01:52:17,451 --> 01:52:17,931
I'm not saying it,

4519
01:52:17,931 --> 01:52:19,390
but it's definitely like he's the,

4520
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:20,170
you're,

4521
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:21,003
you're black,

4522
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,020
you're better than everybody and you,

4523
01:52:23,110 --> 01:52:26,000
you didn't come up the way we want
you to have come up into this sport.

4524
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:26,541
Why don't,

4525
01:52:26,541 --> 01:52:26,721
see,

4526
01:52:26,721 --> 01:52:27,830
I don't know about that.

4527
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:29,180
That's where we disagree.

4528
01:52:29,210 --> 01:52:29,540
Okay.

4529
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:29,791
I mean,

4530
01:52:29,791 --> 01:52:30,110
I just,

4531
01:52:30,110 --> 01:52:31,460
I feel like that was the thing that I've,

4532
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:33,650
when I first heard about Jon
Jones was that there was this,

4533
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:35,650
the myth was created that like,

4534
01:52:35,660 --> 01:52:35,840
you know,

4535
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,580
he learned from watching youtube videos.

4536
01:52:37,581 --> 01:52:40,010
I remember hearing shit like that
you didn't learn very quickly,

4537
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:43,820
very quickly and people
kind of don't like when,

4538
01:52:43,821 --> 01:52:47,030
so this is a thing we tell it like it
was like with the young cash with Cassius

4539
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:47,240
Clay,

4540
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:51,140
when somebody is so young and
so much better than everybody,

4541
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:53,420
and then you put the black
thing on top of that.

4542
01:52:53,421 --> 01:52:55,580
He might've got that if he was white
and so much better than everybody.

4543
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:55,940
They kind of,

4544
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:56,271
they get,

4545
01:52:56,271 --> 01:52:59,510
they sorta getting threatened by that
and then you put black on top of it.

4546
01:52:59,511 --> 01:53:01,910
It's like that's a recipe for a America.

4547
01:53:02,030 --> 01:53:02,481
Yeah.

4548
01:53:02,481 --> 01:53:02,840
People.

4549
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:05,630
And then if we can find some
faults in your character.

4550
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:06,150
Oh Dude.

4551
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:09,490
Was he drinking and driving history as a,

4552
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:12,560
as a professional athlete or is
it especially in a combat sport?

4553
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:13,130
All you,

4554
01:53:13,130 --> 01:53:13,970
all the guys are,

4555
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:14,660
this is the,

4556
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:17,080
this is not the polite thing.

4557
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:17,950
Yeah.

4558
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:18,530
You want,

4559
01:53:18,530 --> 01:53:20,120
you actually want your fighters to be bad.

4560
01:53:20,121 --> 01:53:23,190
Asses who drink and get in
fights and do something,

4561
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:23,541
you know,

4562
01:53:23,541 --> 01:53:23,790
that's,

4563
01:53:23,790 --> 01:53:24,330
that's to me,

4564
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:24,860
the,

4565
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:26,300
to fault him for that is ridiculous.

4566
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:29,930
It's very difficult to find a
bad ass that doesn't do that.

4567
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:30,321
Yes.

4568
01:53:30,321 --> 01:53:30,600
Yeah.

4569
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:31,790
Like Donald's Serone,

4570
01:53:31,830 --> 01:53:34,310
who's one of the best fighters in the UFC,

4571
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:34,941
he,

4572
01:53:34,941 --> 01:53:35,720
he's,

4573
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:38,150
he's a real fucking crazy wild man.

4574
01:53:38,151 --> 01:53:40,370
His name's cowboys nicknames cowboy.

4575
01:53:40,540 --> 01:53:41,570
Where's the fucking cowboy hat?

4576
01:53:41,571 --> 01:53:46,040
Everywhere literally was a bull rider
and drinks beer up until the day of the

4577
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:46,874
weigh ins.

4578
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:47,690
Okay.

4579
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:51,350
D takes the day off to weigh in and
then after the winds will have a beer,

4580
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:53,270
like the day before it's fucking fight.

4581
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:55,640
And in between fights,

4582
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:57,230
he's jet skiing,

4583
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:58,170
wakeboarding,

4584
01:53:58,171 --> 01:53:59,630
and he's a wild motherfucker,

4585
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:02,120
but he's a white dude.

4586
01:54:02,330 --> 01:54:05,990
So like all this talk about him drinking
and he's never like crash a car.

4587
01:54:05,991 --> 01:54:07,070
He's not married.

4588
01:54:07,071 --> 01:54:07,850
He doesn't have,

4589
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:08,151
there's a,

4590
01:54:08,151 --> 01:54:10,640
there's a bunch of shit that
John was like involved in that,

4591
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:13,060
that gave people an
excuse to be upset enough.

4592
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:14,620
They gave him an excuse because if,

4593
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:15,471
if they liked him,

4594
01:54:15,471 --> 01:54:17,120
that stuff would be the
things that made him like,

4595
01:54:17,150 --> 01:54:17,241
oh,

4596
01:54:17,241 --> 01:54:18,051
he's a bad ass.

4597
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:18,950
He doesn't give a shit.

4598
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:22,170
He's out there driving as
Bentley and the trees like that.

4599
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:23,780
That would be stuff that
he was celebrated for.

4600
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:24,710
If they liked him,

4601
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:25,310
yes,

4602
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:26,143
if they liked him.

4603
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:27,560
But I heard people say like,

4604
01:54:27,590 --> 01:54:27,831
oh,

4605
01:54:27,831 --> 01:54:28,611
he's so fake.

4606
01:54:28,611 --> 01:54:29,121
He's so fake.

4607
01:54:29,121 --> 01:54:31,550
Like he's fucking 27 years old.

4608
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:34,970
You don't even know who you were
when you were 27 and if you were,

4609
01:54:35,090 --> 01:54:37,550
were you the fucking light
heavyweight champion of the world?

4610
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:42,160
We would have heard about the
amount of pressure and the,

4611
01:54:42,161 --> 01:54:42,411
the,

4612
01:54:42,411 --> 01:54:44,180
just the scrutiny that he's under.

4613
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:45,590
It's just unprecedented.

4614
01:54:45,591 --> 01:54:45,771
Yeah,

4615
01:54:45,771 --> 01:54:49,250
and I think that it's a MMA at this point,

4616
01:54:49,251 --> 01:54:50,084
I think is a,

4617
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:51,100
I mean I've,

4618
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:51,831
I feel like if that,

4619
01:54:51,831 --> 01:54:52,550
if I was,

4620
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:55,200
if I ever made like sort of
fuck you money or money to do,

4621
01:54:55,490 --> 01:54:59,840
I would open Jujitsu gyms in the ghetto
to train the next generation of black

4622
01:54:59,841 --> 01:55:02,430
MMA fighters because I feel like
there's guys in there who could be,

4623
01:55:02,670 --> 01:55:04,460
it remains a very white sport right now.

4624
01:55:04,790 --> 01:55:06,910
Now black guys historically
have been fighters like it,

4625
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:07,880
professional boxers,

4626
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:09,230
but professional boxing guts,

4627
01:55:09,231 --> 01:55:11,090
so corrupt that the strongest,

4628
01:55:11,091 --> 01:55:13,130
toughest black gang out
in that place for the NFL.

4629
01:55:13,131 --> 01:55:13,521
He doesn't,

4630
01:55:13,521 --> 01:55:14,354
he's not a boxer.

4631
01:55:14,570 --> 01:55:16,040
He's not a heavy heavyweight field though.

4632
01:55:16,190 --> 01:55:18,770
I don't think there'll be a black
heavyweight champion really ever again.

4633
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:19,900
Really Nice.

4634
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:22,760
You say that just because
you know who Deontay Wilders?

4635
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:23,330
No,

4636
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:24,770
no bad motherfucker.

4637
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:28,490
I hope they're being undefeated
heavyweight and just smashing people.

4638
01:55:28,491 --> 01:55:28,910
Good,

4639
01:55:28,910 --> 01:55:29,810
big tall,

4640
01:55:29,811 --> 01:55:30,321
long,

4641
01:55:30,321 --> 01:55:31,520
lanky dude who's got,

4642
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:31,700
oh,

4643
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:33,230
I think he's all knockouts.

4644
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:34,513
Record is just,

4645
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,230
he's a guy that got famous
recently because there was
some crazy fuck who was on

4646
01:55:39,231 --> 01:55:41,780
the Internet who's talking all
kinds of crazy shit to him.

4647
01:55:41,781 --> 01:55:44,310
And so he met him in a
ring and beat the shit out.

4648
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:45,930
You didn't see that.

4649
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:46,111
No,

4650
01:55:46,111 --> 01:55:46,231
no.

4651
01:55:46,231 --> 01:55:46,831
I got to see that.

4652
01:55:46,831 --> 01:55:47,191
Yeah.

4653
01:55:47,191 --> 01:55:52,050
Some crazy guy who said some fucked up
things about his daughter and beat the

4654
01:55:52,051 --> 01:55:53,170
fuck out of him in a,

4655
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,650
in a video that was on TMZ and everything.

4656
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:56,181
Well,

4657
01:55:56,181 --> 01:55:56,550
I think,

4658
01:55:56,550 --> 01:55:57,301
I just think that there's,

4659
01:55:57,301 --> 01:56:00,510
the culture of professional boxing in
this country has changed in the black

4660
01:56:00,511 --> 01:56:01,500
community that I think,

4661
01:56:01,770 --> 01:56:02,760
I think people,

4662
01:56:02,761 --> 01:56:05,490
I think there's a sense of like if Mike
Tyson had vendor Holyfield and ended up

4663
01:56:05,491 --> 01:56:06,324
broke,

4664
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:07,800
what chance do I stand?

4665
01:56:08,050 --> 01:56:11,400
Floyd Mayweather has
untold amounts of money.

4666
01:56:11,550 --> 01:56:12,890
It's my time management,

4667
01:56:12,891 --> 01:56:14,160
I shit it is for now.

4668
01:56:16,250 --> 01:56:16,770
I don't,

4669
01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:17,370
and I'm not trying,

4670
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:20,100
I don't want to get a war
with Floyd Mayweather started,

4671
01:56:20,101 --> 01:56:25,050
but I just feel like who had Mike
Tyson had untold amounts of money.

4672
01:56:25,170 --> 01:56:25,381
Now,

4673
01:56:25,381 --> 01:56:27,720
Mayweather has more because
of his airplane mode,

4674
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:29,820
but Mike Tyson,

4675
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:33,270
who Mike Tyson and Holyfield head untold
amount of money at the time and they're

4676
01:56:33,271 --> 01:56:34,104
both,

4677
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:34,710
I don't think,

4678
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:35,401
I don't know how they're living,

4679
01:56:35,401 --> 01:56:36,780
but they're not living the way they were.

4680
01:56:36,810 --> 01:56:38,040
But that's a management issue.

4681
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:38,461
It hasn't been.

4682
01:56:38,461 --> 01:56:39,680
But I think the problem is is you come in,

4683
01:56:39,681 --> 01:56:40,920
it's the same thing we
talked about earlier.

4684
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:41,903
You come out of the,

4685
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:43,230
the bad neighborhood,

4686
01:56:43,231 --> 01:56:43,441
you,

4687
01:56:43,441 --> 01:56:43,950
you don't,

4688
01:56:43,950 --> 01:56:44,281
you,

4689
01:56:44,281 --> 01:56:44,880
you learn,

4690
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:45,211
they learn.

4691
01:56:45,211 --> 01:56:45,840
You're an athlete.

4692
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:46,860
They don't teach you the rest.

4693
01:56:46,861 --> 01:56:48,840
They don't teach you like how
to be a good manager to that.

4694
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:50,130
You're signing with a,

4695
01:56:50,131 --> 01:56:51,180
with a boxing manager,

4696
01:56:51,181 --> 01:56:52,200
Don king who just like,

4697
01:56:52,201 --> 01:56:53,460
just sign this blank piece of paper.

4698
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:54,293
I'll take care of it.

4699
01:56:54,630 --> 01:56:55,411
So it's a,

4700
01:56:55,411 --> 01:56:57,900
it's a recurring process
that happens and that thing,

4701
01:56:57,990 --> 01:56:59,340
whereas at least if you go to the NFL,

4702
01:56:59,341 --> 01:57:00,360
you get a contract,

4703
01:57:01,270 --> 01:57:03,360
you get an actual thing that we're
going to pay you this much and it's not

4704
01:57:03,361 --> 01:57:03,991
guaranteed.

4705
01:57:03,991 --> 01:57:04,651
Or if you go to the NBA,

4706
01:57:04,651 --> 01:57:05,850
you get a guaranteed contract.

4707
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:08,400
Or my theory is that a
lot of those dudes go,

4708
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:10,670
instead of going into a boxing
ring and get my brains beat,

4709
01:57:10,671 --> 01:57:13,440
now I'm just going to hang out with the
best basketball player in town and be

4710
01:57:13,441 --> 01:57:14,850
his NBN as posse.

4711
01:57:14,910 --> 01:57:16,560
You know that it doesn't pay as much,

4712
01:57:16,561 --> 01:57:18,270
but at least I'm not getting ripped off.

4713
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:19,530
I don't know where's,

4714
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:21,000
where's the [inaudible] champion?

4715
01:57:21,970 --> 01:57:22,410
What?

4716
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:25,590
Why aren't black guys in boxing
anymore or the why aren't there?

4717
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:29,550
Why he used to be that it was a done
deal that a black guy would be the

4718
01:57:29,551 --> 01:57:30,210
heavyweight champion.

4719
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:34,050
There is a real problem and that
problem is a six foot six Russian,

4720
01:57:34,890 --> 01:57:38,430
Vladimir Klitschko who's one of the best
boxers that heavyweight division's ever

4721
01:57:38,431 --> 01:57:38,760
known.

4722
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:39,091
I mean,

4723
01:57:39,091 --> 01:57:40,350
Vladimir Klitschko is up,

4724
01:57:40,430 --> 01:57:41,040
I'm not fucking,

4725
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:41,701
I'm not in any way,

4726
01:57:41,701 --> 01:57:42,480
but it's just,

4727
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:42,720
no,

4728
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:43,553
it's weird.

4729
01:57:43,650 --> 01:57:46,710
Who would've ever thought that we would
be a white heavyweight champion that no

4730
01:57:46,711 --> 01:57:47,940
one gives a fuck about?

4731
01:57:47,970 --> 01:57:48,840
No one gives a fuck about,

4732
01:57:48,870 --> 01:57:51,360
no one gives a fuck about
the heavyweight champion.

4733
01:57:51,361 --> 01:57:54,000
He used to be the the most famous
guy on the planet and that,

4734
01:57:54,001 --> 01:57:56,130
and that ended with when
Lennox Lewis retired.

4735
01:57:56,131 --> 01:57:56,461
I think,

4736
01:57:56,461 --> 01:57:56,791
dude,

4737
01:57:56,791 --> 01:57:58,200
I was on a fucking plane,

4738
01:57:58,201 --> 01:58:01,050
Vladimir Klitschko and
no one knew who he was.

4739
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:04,470
I was thinking about whether I should
interrupt him and say hi and say I'm a big

4740
01:58:04,471 --> 01:58:04,741
fan.

4741
01:58:04,741 --> 01:58:07,920
Like that dude's probably so happy
that no one's talking to him right now.

4742
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:08,760
I'll leave him alone.

4743
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,470
But then I realized no
one was talking to him.

4744
01:58:10,471 --> 01:58:11,500
Nobody fucking talk to him.

4745
01:58:12,050 --> 01:58:12,441
There's a,

4746
01:58:12,441 --> 01:58:14,040
that's a a shift.

4747
01:58:14,041 --> 01:58:16,230
The heavyweight champion used to be
the most famous guy on the plane.

4748
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:16,360
Yeah.

4749
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:17,011
My friend goes,

4750
01:58:17,011 --> 01:58:17,311
man,

4751
01:58:17,311 --> 01:58:18,210
that guy is fucking huge.

4752
01:58:18,211 --> 01:58:18,600
I go,

4753
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,280
do you know that's a
heavyweight boxing champion,

4754
01:58:20,281 --> 01:58:20,521
the world.

4755
01:58:20,521 --> 01:58:20,701
He goes,

4756
01:58:20,701 --> 01:58:21,080
what?

4757
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:21,850
Yeah,

4758
01:58:21,850 --> 01:58:22,683
yeah,

4759
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:23,963
yeah.

4760
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:24,973
I got that.

4761
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:27,110
That's Vladimir Klitschko now in Ukraine.

4762
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:27,811
He would be,

4763
01:58:27,811 --> 01:58:29,580
I'm sure he gets them up in Germany.

4764
01:58:30,370 --> 01:58:32,340
He actually speaks like
five different languages.

4765
01:58:32,341 --> 01:58:33,360
He's a phd.

4766
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:34,800
He's a brilliant guy.

4767
01:58:34,801 --> 01:58:35,011
I mean,

4768
01:58:35,011 --> 01:58:38,100
it's a really unique guy to
be a heavyweight champion.

4769
01:58:38,330 --> 01:58:41,200
Him and his brother were heavyweight
champions in the same time.

4770
01:58:41,201 --> 01:58:41,711
Didn't want to end.

4771
01:58:41,711 --> 01:58:42,544
Didn't fight each other.

4772
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:45,430
It was so strange thing is so corrupt.

4773
01:58:45,431 --> 01:58:45,971
I mean there's like,

4774
01:58:45,971 --> 01:58:46,241
you know,

4775
01:58:46,241 --> 01:58:47,110
why do you say that?

4776
01:58:47,730 --> 01:58:48,040
What do you,

4777
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:48,490
what do you,

4778
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:48,661
what,

4779
01:58:48,661 --> 01:58:49,990
what do you think is corrupt about it?

4780
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:52,330
I think no Shay statement.

4781
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:53,021
Well here's what the,

4782
01:58:53,021 --> 01:58:54,150
here's why the value,

4783
01:58:54,430 --> 01:58:55,263
I'll bring it to this.

4784
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:58,090
The UFC is doing a good job right now.

4785
01:58:58,270 --> 01:59:02,260
It's a central organization that has a
series of practices and this is the way

4786
01:59:02,261 --> 01:59:02,951
you have to do it.

4787
01:59:02,951 --> 01:59:03,271
And that,

4788
01:59:03,271 --> 01:59:03,690
that,

4789
01:59:03,690 --> 01:59:04,370
that the,

4790
01:59:04,370 --> 01:59:06,070
you can call it a monopoly if you want to,

4791
01:59:06,071 --> 01:59:08,470
but it's a centralized
organization that runs everything.

4792
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:12,640
Boxing is a bunch of different
organizations that each
set their own rules and

4793
01:59:12,641 --> 01:59:12,970
don't.

4794
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:14,230
So there's not a way to go.

4795
01:59:14,770 --> 01:59:16,340
How do we make these fighters fight?

4796
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:19,750
You can't avoid a fight if you're the
best guy in the UFC and there's a number

4797
01:59:19,751 --> 01:59:20,230
two guy,

4798
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:21,063
you guys are going to fight.

4799
01:59:21,390 --> 01:59:21,940
No.

4800
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:22,531
But boxing,

4801
01:59:22,531 --> 01:59:23,980
cause there's a bunch of
splinter organizations,

4802
01:59:23,981 --> 01:59:24,760
you can't,

4803
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:27,790
we never got to see Holyfield
Tyson fight in their prime,

4804
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:28,691
you know,

4805
01:59:28,691 --> 01:59:31,570
because of Pacquiao and
Mayweather because of all the,

4806
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:32,880
all the back water deal.

4807
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:33,850
People are trying to keep the,

4808
01:59:33,851 --> 01:59:34,990
protect their side of it.

4809
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:38,140
And so I don't want him to fight that
guy because if he loses then we lose all

4810
01:59:38,141 --> 01:59:38,561
our things.

4811
01:59:38,561 --> 01:59:39,040
So there's,

4812
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,360
it's not what's good for the sport.

4813
01:59:40,361 --> 01:59:42,940
It's what's good for the bottom
line and the dollar and what the,

4814
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:46,420
and so therefore it leads to corruption
and it leads select things that happened

4815
01:59:46,421 --> 01:59:46,691
where,

4816
01:59:46,691 --> 01:59:47,860
why aren't these fights happening?

4817
01:59:47,861 --> 01:59:48,300
And then,

4818
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:49,960
and also the thing with Don King,

4819
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:50,800
you know,

4820
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,240
he Tyson will tell,

4821
01:59:52,241 --> 01:59:52,451
you know,

4822
01:59:52,451 --> 01:59:53,140
I'm sure you to,

4823
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:56,830
I talked to my Tyson before then don king
became the biggest promoter because he

4824
01:59:56,831 --> 01:59:58,600
was ripping everybody the fuck off.

4825
01:59:59,110 --> 02:00:02,740
And so there's no central
authority to rule over and say,

4826
02:00:02,741 --> 02:00:05,860
we have to clean this up so and so and so.

4827
02:00:05,861 --> 02:00:07,240
It leads to a lot of corruption.

4828
02:00:07,390 --> 02:00:08,230
And it leads to,

4829
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:11,470
there's no reason that Mike
Tyson should be broke right now.

4830
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:12,940
Despite all the shit he went through.

4831
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:14,073
There's no reason.

4832
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:15,400
That's where I disagree with you.

4833
02:00:15,401 --> 02:00:18,400
I don't attribute that to to
corruption and neither does he.

4834
02:00:18,730 --> 02:00:20,290
He just went crazy and
spent all his money.

4835
02:00:20,291 --> 02:00:25,291
I mean he has a fucking one man Broadway
show where he talks about shows 350

4836
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:25,481
million.

4837
02:00:25,481 --> 02:00:25,721
He goes,

4838
02:00:25,721 --> 02:00:26,020
yes,

4839
02:00:26,020 --> 02:00:27,170
I spent that much,

4840
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:28,720
but he's he,

4841
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:29,830
he did spend that much,

4842
02:00:29,831 --> 02:00:30,640
but he also,

4843
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:31,630
I'm sure would tell you,

4844
02:00:31,631 --> 02:00:33,490
and that somebody also too,

4845
02:00:33,491 --> 02:00:36,160
that somebody else took
millions of dollars from him
that they weren't supposed

4846
02:00:36,161 --> 02:00:36,430
to have.

4847
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:37,091
They okay.

4848
02:00:37,091 --> 02:00:37,811
That is true.

4849
02:00:37,811 --> 02:00:39,070
Someone stole money from him.

4850
02:00:39,071 --> 02:00:39,581
However,

4851
02:00:39,581 --> 02:00:40,450
if he had that money,

4852
02:00:40,451 --> 02:00:41,320
he would spend it too.

4853
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:42,160
Well I would,

4854
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:42,850
I wish I would.

4855
02:00:42,850 --> 02:00:44,200
I would like to give him
the chance to spend it.

4856
02:00:44,201 --> 02:00:47,290
That's all I would have liked to have
been with someone who is a financial

4857
02:00:47,291 --> 02:00:50,440
advisor who would have set
some money aside very early on.

4858
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:52,360
And you know as [inaudible] has that.

4859
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:53,351
Yes he does.

4860
02:00:53,351 --> 02:00:53,730
Yeah.

4861
02:00:53,730 --> 02:00:57,670
We were talking about that recently and
Iverson turns 50 he gets millions of

4862
02:00:57,670 --> 02:00:57,671
dollars,

4863
02:00:57,671 --> 02:00:58,271
millions of dollars.

4864
02:00:58,271 --> 02:00:59,104
So he's just,

4865
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:00,130
he's just working for the,

4866
02:01:00,131 --> 02:01:03,190
I think for the 70 sixers
until that kicks in.

4867
02:01:03,191 --> 02:01:07,510
And I think that that the Michael Jordan
sort of established the modern NBA of

4868
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:07,721
like,

4869
02:01:07,721 --> 02:01:07,871
no,

4870
02:01:07,871 --> 02:01:11,230
get a money manager and get a guy who
protects your things and don't invest in

4871
02:01:11,231 --> 02:01:11,681
stupid shit.

4872
02:01:11,681 --> 02:01:13,240
And so some people will end up broke,

4873
02:01:13,450 --> 02:01:15,370
but you think that the NFL is corrupt.

4874
02:01:15,371 --> 02:01:17,200
Do you think that the NBA is corrupt?

4875
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:22,270
Not In the way that boxing is curled
because this way cause a you 80% of NFL

4876
02:01:22,271 --> 02:01:25,090
players within two years or
bankrupt after they retire.

4877
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:26,223
80% yes.

4878
02:01:26,230 --> 02:01:28,590
60 something percent of NBA player.

4879
02:01:28,591 --> 02:01:29,200
Same thing.

4880
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:30,940
Bankrupt within two years of retirement.

4881
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:34,600
So I don't think it's an issue of
corruption when it comes to how much money

4882
02:01:34,601 --> 02:01:35,260
they blow,

4883
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:37,630
as much as they get that money,

4884
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:39,620
it's flowing in like a river.

4885
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:42,080
The ESPN documentary broke.

4886
02:01:42,210 --> 02:01:42,570
Yeah,

4887
02:01:42,570 --> 02:01:43,403
I didn't say it.

4888
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:43,941
It's about,

4889
02:01:43,941 --> 02:01:44,330
it's about,

4890
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:44,930
it's about that.

4891
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:45,460
Yeah.

4892
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:46,850
Guy like Mike Tyson was,

4893
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:48,980
grew up in Brownsville,

4894
02:01:48,981 --> 02:01:49,850
poor as hell.

4895
02:01:49,970 --> 02:01:53,030
And then all of a sudden he has
hundreds of millions of dollars.

4896
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:53,930
He's got,

4897
02:01:53,930 --> 02:01:58,930
Tiger's Charlie Murphy came on my podcast
until the fucking story about Mike

4898
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,530
Tyson about showing up at Mike Tyson,

4899
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:03,140
Mike Tyson in the front
lawn plane with a tiger.

4900
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:04,580
So he had a fucking tight,

4901
02:02:04,581 --> 02:02:05,810
nobody would get out of the car.

4902
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,340
Everybody stayed in their car.

4903
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:09,120
Here's my thing,

4904
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:12,380
the corruption leads to people not
wanting to participate in the sport in the

4905
02:02:12,381 --> 02:02:12,860
same way.

4906
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:13,730
That's what I believe.

4907
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:14,780
I don't think so man.

4908
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:16,480
I just think that the,

4909
02:02:16,530 --> 02:02:17,211
that you go,

4910
02:02:17,211 --> 02:02:21,170
why don't I have used to be a football
player looking at it in terms of this

4911
02:02:21,171 --> 02:02:22,250
longterm thing.

4912
02:02:22,251 --> 02:02:25,310
I think there's less people that are
getting involved in boxing first of all,

4913
02:02:25,311 --> 02:02:27,140
because more people are
getting involved in MMA.

4914
02:02:27,290 --> 02:02:28,880
That's one thing that's
definitely happening,

4915
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,930
but black more black dudes
aren't getting involved.

4916
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:32,480
I mean maybe starting to,

4917
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:33,463
but that wasn't the,

4918
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:34,320
there was a,

4919
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:34,790
uh,

4920
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:35,470
there was a disk,

4921
02:02:35,470 --> 02:02:36,100
there was a,

4922
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:40,160
a gulf between the end of boxing being a
big sport then of heavyweight champions

4923
02:02:40,161 --> 02:02:43,250
being a big thing and in the
MMA taking prominence and that,

4924
02:02:43,251 --> 02:02:43,701
what was it,

4925
02:02:43,701 --> 02:02:44,900
what happened in that Gulf?

4926
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:46,730
Like between Lennox Lewis going,

4927
02:02:46,731 --> 02:02:50,780
I'm out in between and to John Jones
there's like a Gulf of like where did all

4928
02:02:50,781 --> 02:02:51,280
the black,

4929
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:51,490
white,

4930
02:02:51,490 --> 02:02:52,670
old black heavyweight champions go.

4931
02:02:52,671 --> 02:02:53,930
Where'd all the black dudes
who are going to be here?

4932
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:57,680
But there was still a lot of black
fighters in the lower weight classes.

4933
02:02:57,681 --> 02:02:59,570
Like that was Roy Jones was still around.

4934
02:02:59,571 --> 02:03:00,381
There's Hopkins,

4935
02:03:00,381 --> 02:03:01,214
if you're thinking about

4936
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:05,270
the heavyweight champion was the
baddest motherfucker on the planet.

4937
02:03:05,271 --> 02:03:08,540
It's hard to find really big dudes that
are willing to get punched in the face.

4938
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:08,841
Yeah,

4939
02:03:08,841 --> 02:03:13,370
that's your thing is boxing is just so
fucking hard to do in comparison to other

4940
02:03:13,371 --> 02:03:16,310
sports like football because not
that football's not hard to do,

4941
02:03:16,311 --> 02:03:17,430
but you,

4942
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:20,450
you could be a great football player
and never have the courage to be able to

4943
02:03:20,451 --> 02:03:23,340
step into a ring on your own and your
underwear and go toe to toe with a gun.

4944
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:24,350
Cause you could,

4945
02:03:24,350 --> 02:03:24,621
you know,

4946
02:03:24,621 --> 02:03:27,800
Bob could fucking drop the ball and you
can lose the game and you can still go

4947
02:03:27,801 --> 02:03:28,600
out and party.

4948
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:29,750
But if you get your ass kicked,

4949
02:03:29,751 --> 02:03:30,950
you got your fucking ass kid.

4950
02:03:30,980 --> 02:03:31,731
You did it,

4951
02:03:31,731 --> 02:03:32,690
it's all on you.

4952
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:33,200
Yeah.

4953
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:35,690
A lot of people are not
psychologically bill for that.

4954
02:03:35,730 --> 02:03:36,141
We'll that.

4955
02:03:36,141 --> 02:03:37,520
But that's the thing I
think is interesting.

4956
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:42,320
For years they were up through
up through a Holyfield and Tyson.

4957
02:03:42,321 --> 02:03:42,591
They were,

4958
02:03:42,591 --> 02:03:43,620
and then some what,

4959
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:44,631
and again,

4960
02:03:44,631 --> 02:03:46,730
some of those dudes are
getting concussions in the NFL,

4961
02:03:46,731 --> 02:03:46,881
like,

4962
02:03:46,881 --> 02:03:47,150
you know?

4963
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:47,480
Yes.

4964
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:48,313
It's not like,

4965
02:03:48,410 --> 02:03:49,243
I just think there's,

4966
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:50,263
you know,

4967
02:03:50,290 --> 02:03:51,340
that's my theory about it.

4968
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:52,720
I certainly don't you right.

4969
02:03:52,730 --> 02:03:53,563
But I just feel like this,

4970
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:56,840
the culture of the sport became so
corrupt that I don't think people,

4971
02:03:56,990 --> 02:03:58,160
I see where you're coming from,

4972
02:03:58,161 --> 02:04:01,490
but I really honestly don't think
that it's coming from a point of like,

4973
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:02,150
okay,

4974
02:04:02,150 --> 02:04:03,140
we've seen the future.

4975
02:04:03,141 --> 02:04:04,220
This is where this ends up.

4976
02:04:04,221 --> 02:04:05,090
Let's not do this.

4977
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:05,271
No,

4978
02:04:05,271 --> 02:04:05,540
I don't.

4979
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:06,351
And that's why the future.

4980
02:04:06,351 --> 02:04:08,270
But I think there's a sense
that like if you're a kid,

4981
02:04:08,271 --> 02:04:10,370
if you're a kid who's six foot three,

4982
02:04:10,580 --> 02:04:12,290
two 50 and you go,

4983
02:04:12,350 --> 02:04:12,651
man,

4984
02:04:12,651 --> 02:04:14,300
do I want to be a,

4985
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:18,650
do I want to be a basketball player like
Lebron James or Michael Jordan or Kobe,

4986
02:04:18,651 --> 02:04:19,070
right.

4987
02:04:19,070 --> 02:04:19,910
We're going to be a boxer,

4988
02:04:19,911 --> 02:04:21,020
like a Vanderhoof fit or my,

4989
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:23,870
Oh wait a second it dudes are broke.

4990
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:24,530
Do you know what I mean?

4991
02:04:24,530 --> 02:04:26,720
But they didn't have to be broke man.

4992
02:04:26,721 --> 02:04:27,554
They did.

4993
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:29,181
They are.

4994
02:04:29,181 --> 02:04:33,080
They are the nuts and more importantly
than broke his brain damage.

4995
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:35,360
I think that is the most
intelligent thing to avoid.

4996
02:04:35,380 --> 02:04:35,660
Yes.

4997
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:37,920
I think that as one thing,

4998
02:04:37,950 --> 02:04:40,410
as different economic groups,

4999
02:04:41,030 --> 02:04:41,340
uh,

5000
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:42,900
excel in the culture,

5001
02:04:42,990 --> 02:04:44,730
they become less likely to be fighters.

5002
02:04:44,850 --> 02:04:46,940
That is one thing that
happens on a pretty,

5003
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:48,180
pretty consistent basis.

5004
02:04:48,450 --> 02:04:50,040
Whoever on the bottom of the economic it.

5005
02:04:50,050 --> 02:04:51,170
That's why it was Irish dudes.

5006
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:52,970
Yeah.

5007
02:04:52,970 --> 02:04:54,720
And I think it's Italian for awhile.

5008
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:56,100
It's also boxing.

5009
02:04:56,101 --> 02:04:57,590
It's like brain damage.

5010
02:04:57,630 --> 02:04:58,710
Fucking unavoidable.

5011
02:04:58,740 --> 02:04:59,190
Yes.

5012
02:04:59,190 --> 02:04:59,731
And you can't,

5013
02:04:59,731 --> 02:05:01,170
you can't do it for long without,

5014
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:03,030
I mean I think Lennox Lewis
got out when he was like,

5015
02:05:03,031 --> 02:05:03,211
okay,

5016
02:05:03,211 --> 02:05:05,130
I've beaten everybody at this point.

5017
02:05:05,131 --> 02:05:07,380
It's just going to be about
taking too many hits to the head.

5018
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:07,951
Yeah.

5019
02:05:07,951 --> 02:05:08,850
And very smart.

5020
02:05:08,851 --> 02:05:11,010
And he's shown a little
bit of deterioration now.

5021
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,380
How could you not you can't you,

5022
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:13,110
how could you not?

5023
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:13,970
Nobody rides for free.

5024
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:15,150
That was a big boxing fan.

5025
02:05:15,151 --> 02:05:15,570
So I just,

5026
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:19,620
I sort of missed the fact that the
heavyweight title was like an event,

5027
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:20,930
like wouldn't use like this.

5028
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:21,750
It wasn't then you,

5029
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:22,620
everybody paid attention.

5030
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:25,980
People who didn't care about boxing knew
who the heavy weight champion goes are

5031
02:05:25,981 --> 02:05:26,814
boring as fuck.

5032
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:29,820
Boring because they're
smart and they're not,

5033
02:05:29,850 --> 02:05:30,930
they're not going in there to,

5034
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:32,220
they're not trying to have blood wars.

5035
02:05:32,221 --> 02:05:32,341
Like,

5036
02:05:32,341 --> 02:05:32,640
you know,

5037
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:33,510
when you watch seven,

5038
02:05:33,511 --> 02:05:35,730
1970s boxing and it's like,

5039
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:36,121
you know,

5040
02:05:36,121 --> 02:05:38,840
15 rounds Ernie Shavers.

5041
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:39,390
Yeah.

5042
02:05:39,390 --> 02:05:41,940
And it's a dude be like breaks his
jaw and the third round and it says,

5043
02:05:41,941 --> 02:05:42,630
I'm good.

5044
02:05:42,630 --> 02:05:42,781
No,

5045
02:05:42,781 --> 02:05:43,471
I didn't break my jaw.

5046
02:05:43,471 --> 02:05:44,280
I didn't break my job.

5047
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:44,581
Yeah.

5048
02:05:44,581 --> 02:05:45,414
Like it's like,

5049
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:45,840
you know,

5050
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:46,980
I'm a huge Ali fan.

5051
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:48,540
He's another surrogate Dolly,

5052
02:05:48,541 --> 02:05:51,240
Ken Norton because John
and they just still,

5053
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:51,720
nope,

5054
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:52,080
don't say,

5055
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:53,120
don't tell him buddy.

5056
02:05:53,710 --> 02:05:58,650
I'll see you at the hospital later
that I missed that spectacle of like,

5057
02:05:58,651 --> 02:05:58,891
I mean,

5058
02:05:58,891 --> 02:06:03,210
I remember being in a video
store in Chicago and they
had the Tyson fight on and

5059
02:06:03,211 --> 02:06:04,044
it was like,

5060
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:05,850
maybe it was a Carl the truth.

5061
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:06,990
Yeah.

5062
02:06:06,990 --> 02:06:08,790
And it was like the thing
where me and my friend go,

5063
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:09,181
oh,

5064
02:06:09,181 --> 02:06:09,961
let's just stay a minute.

5065
02:06:09,961 --> 02:06:10,800
This will only take a minute.

5066
02:06:10,801 --> 02:06:11,634
And it did.

5067
02:06:13,710 --> 02:06:15,330
Like I liked that,

5068
02:06:15,331 --> 02:06:15,691
you know?

5069
02:06:15,691 --> 02:06:18,360
And so you know that I'm a
fan of that and I miss it.

5070
02:06:18,361 --> 02:06:21,360
And I don't think all those
dudes ended up in MMA yet.

5071
02:06:21,361 --> 02:06:21,601
I mean,

5072
02:06:21,601 --> 02:06:22,021
maybe they will.

5073
02:06:22,021 --> 02:06:24,930
I think most of them ended up in
football and a lot of them ended up in

5074
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:25,650
basketball.

5075
02:06:25,650 --> 02:06:28,860
Terry Norris Turney Norris was a
one of those guys from that day.

5076
02:06:28,861 --> 02:06:29,850
It was a big star.

5077
02:06:29,851 --> 02:06:30,960
He's all fucked up now,

5078
02:06:30,961 --> 02:06:31,690
man.

5079
02:06:31,690 --> 02:06:36,330
I ran into him in Vegas a few years back
and I was listening to him talk to some

5080
02:06:36,331 --> 02:06:40,290
fans and he was slurring his words and
could barely put a sentence together.

5081
02:06:40,291 --> 02:06:40,740
And I was like,

5082
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:41,221
Damn.

5083
02:06:41,221 --> 02:06:43,440
I remember when Terry
Norris was the champ.

5084
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:43,741
Yeah.

5085
02:06:43,741 --> 02:06:45,510
And it's weird to think about Ali,

5086
02:06:45,511 --> 02:06:46,344
for example,

5087
02:06:46,530 --> 02:06:50,610
it's the jury's out whether he got his
Parkinson's related to the center right

5088
02:06:50,611 --> 02:06:51,270
now.

5089
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:52,140
Fuck that jury.

5090
02:06:53,210 --> 02:06:54,630
The jury's it filled with idiots.

5091
02:06:54,670 --> 02:06:54,930
Yeah.

5092
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:57,780
Tell you from a person as a lifetime
investment in combat sports.

5093
02:06:57,781 --> 02:06:59,100
That's 100% trauma related.

5094
02:06:59,101 --> 02:06:59,401
Okay.

5095
02:06:59,401 --> 02:06:59,860
Yeah.

5096
02:06:59,860 --> 02:07:02,310
Parkinson's is a trauma related
disease and a lot of people,

5097
02:07:02,311 --> 02:07:04,410
Freddy Roach has
Parkinson's related trauma.

5098
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:04,980
Okay.

5099
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:08,910
It's one of the reasons why he forced
Manny Pacquiao to take a whole year off

5100
02:07:08,911 --> 02:07:10,260
after mark has knocked him out.

5101
02:07:10,570 --> 02:07:11,010
He's like,

5102
02:07:11,010 --> 02:07:11,401
dude,

5103
02:07:11,401 --> 02:07:13,770
you're not fighting now we're
going to take a year off.

5104
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:14,490
Yeah,

5105
02:07:14,490 --> 02:07:15,323
just to get yourself.

5106
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:16,530
Well that's a great,

5107
02:07:16,531 --> 02:07:18,930
well then the Ali who's still alive,

5108
02:07:18,931 --> 02:07:20,670
we sort of almost treat
him like he's dead.

5109
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:21,781
And then every now and again,

5110
02:07:21,781 --> 02:07:23,180
like he just joined
Twitter and you're like,

5111
02:07:23,490 --> 02:07:24,330
it's just weird to be like,

5112
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:26,010
and some of them were coming
from the champion you like,

5113
02:07:26,011 --> 02:07:30,930
are they really like if Ali was still
with you because he's not that old.

5114
02:07:30,931 --> 02:07:32,280
He's in his 70 [inaudible] he's old,

5115
02:07:32,281 --> 02:07:32,911
but he's not like,

5116
02:07:32,911 --> 02:07:33,091
you know,

5117
02:07:33,091 --> 02:07:36,160
he's got a hundred if he was still
around and still talking as in

5118
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:37,660
talking relatively fast and was,

5119
02:07:37,661 --> 02:07:38,080
he was,

5120
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:40,360
he'd be an ambassador for
you should be a boxer.

5121
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:41,471
But because of,

5122
02:07:41,471 --> 02:07:41,981
like you said,

5123
02:07:41,981 --> 02:07:43,150
the trauma related injuries,

5124
02:07:43,151 --> 02:07:43,984
he has not,

5125
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:44,920
there's no,

5126
02:07:44,921 --> 02:07:45,970
no old boxers.

5127
02:07:45,971 --> 02:07:48,370
A good ambassador for boxing
except Bernard Hopkins,

5128
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:49,510
which is ridiculous.

5129
02:07:49,511 --> 02:07:51,010
49 years old still.

5130
02:07:51,011 --> 02:07:52,600
The champ talks great.

5131
02:07:52,870 --> 02:07:56,410
Still full of energy outboxes
and shit out us and young guys.

5132
02:07:56,740 --> 02:07:57,860
He's a freak man.

5133
02:07:58,030 --> 02:07:59,250
I think we just talked
about earlier with the,

5134
02:07:59,260 --> 02:08:00,880
some people are doing
crystal meth and it's fine.

5135
02:08:02,830 --> 02:08:05,160
It's the same thing that
everybody has to take the hits.

5136
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:07,840
Well he's also got a
very intelligent style.

5137
02:08:07,841 --> 02:08:09,460
He doesn't brawl with anybody.

5138
02:08:09,461 --> 02:08:12,490
He brawls on his terms clinches a lot.

5139
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:13,660
He holds onto guys.

5140
02:08:13,810 --> 02:08:14,180
He,

5141
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:14,411
he'll,

5142
02:08:14,411 --> 02:08:19,270
he'll use rough house tactics to push
them out of their game and just aware he

5143
02:08:19,271 --> 02:08:20,950
understands what to do.

5144
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:25,720
Like before boxing is one of those things
where if you look at it and on like if

5145
02:08:25,721 --> 02:08:27,330
you don't have any education in,

5146
02:08:27,331 --> 02:08:29,170
in boxing and you watch
it on television like,

5147
02:08:29,171 --> 02:08:32,020
well this guy is trying to hit this guy
and the other guy is faster so he can't

5148
02:08:32,021 --> 02:08:32,680
hit him.

5149
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:32,921
No.

5150
02:08:32,921 --> 02:08:34,270
This footwork involved.

5151
02:08:34,271 --> 02:08:34,540
There's,

5152
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:39,340
he's doing movements that get you to
react and he's anticipating your reaction

5153
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:41,380
and then giving you another
thing to think about.

5154
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:42,760
And then when you react to that,

5155
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:45,340
you're going to step here and
he's ready with an overhand right.

5156
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:47,620
And these things are all in his mind.

5157
02:08:47,621 --> 02:08:49,210
These are all foregone conclusions.

5158
02:08:49,390 --> 02:08:50,350
But to a young guy,

5159
02:08:50,351 --> 02:08:51,850
he's just going to use
his speed and his death,

5160
02:08:52,030 --> 02:08:53,950
but you don't ever get a
chance to use that speed.

5161
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:55,150
He's already on you.

5162
02:08:55,151 --> 02:08:58,210
He's already making you move
and dance to his rhythm.

5163
02:08:58,211 --> 02:08:59,044
He's got your,

5164
02:08:59,070 --> 02:08:59,950
he's the Marionette,

5165
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:02,620
you're the puppet and you don't
realize it until it's the 10th round.

5166
02:09:02,621 --> 02:09:04,180
You get your ass kicked and you're like,

5167
02:09:04,181 --> 02:09:04,481
fuck.

5168
02:09:04,481 --> 02:09:04,751
And they're like,

5169
02:09:04,751 --> 02:09:05,360
you need to knock guy.

5170
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:06,193
Like I can't even fucking,

5171
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:08,230
you know,

5172
02:09:08,230 --> 02:09:08,591
I can't,

5173
02:09:08,591 --> 02:09:10,210
I haven't touched him
since the first round.

5174
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:12,670
You see that Russian guy that he
beat for the light heavyweight title,

5175
02:09:14,250 --> 02:09:15,850
he's boxing the shit out of the sky.

5176
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:18,670
And the 10th round Blam dropped some.

5177
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:19,181
They're like,

5178
02:09:19,181 --> 02:09:19,361
you know,

5179
02:09:19,361 --> 02:09:22,480
you need to stop him unions in
the 10th round Hopkins drops him.

5180
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:24,850
Mother fucker can't even hit him.

5181
02:09:25,180 --> 02:09:25,480
No,

5182
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:26,500
it's just too good.

5183
02:09:27,330 --> 02:09:27,431
I,

5184
02:09:27,431 --> 02:09:32,380
in college I briefly joined a boxing
club and got hit by a dude who was not a

5185
02:09:32,381 --> 02:09:33,250
professional boxer,

5186
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:35,740
but like the hardest I've ever had
been hit in my life and I was like,

5187
02:09:35,741 --> 02:09:35,791
Oh,

5188
02:09:35,791 --> 02:09:37,120
I think I'm done with this boxing club.

5189
02:09:37,121 --> 02:09:37,280
Like,

5190
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:37,810
you know,

5191
02:09:37,810 --> 02:09:38,551
you get rocked hard.

5192
02:09:38,551 --> 02:09:38,800
I was like,

5193
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:40,570
I think I'm going to
just go back to class.

5194
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:42,640
They will trying to be a comedian,

5195
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:46,450
but boxing to be taught properly should
be taught where you don't hit each other

5196
02:09:46,451 --> 02:09:47,470
hard at all.

5197
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:48,011
Well this was,

5198
02:09:48,011 --> 02:09:52,360
Alicia was like a guy who had like an x
as in Philadelphia at this guy was an ex

5199
02:09:52,930 --> 02:09:53,441
boxer,

5200
02:09:53,441 --> 02:09:54,520
had fought sugar ray Leonard.

5201
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:56,200
Like that was his big story.

5202
02:09:56,230 --> 02:09:57,160
It lost the sugary lender,

5203
02:09:57,161 --> 02:09:57,700
which is numbers.

5204
02:09:57,700 --> 02:09:58,120
Name.

5205
02:09:58,120 --> 02:09:58,953
Uh,

5206
02:10:00,010 --> 02:10:00,521
no,

5207
02:10:00,521 --> 02:10:01,450
this was a long time ago.

5208
02:10:01,570 --> 02:10:02,140
Uh,

5209
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:02,351
yeah.

5210
02:10:02,351 --> 02:10:03,190
I don't remember his name,

5211
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:04,090
but he was a,

5212
02:10:04,090 --> 02:10:04,960
I would recommend he,

5213
02:10:04,961 --> 02:10:05,100
yeah,

5214
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:07,720
he fought sugar ray Leonard
in Philly at the blue horizon.

5215
02:10:07,790 --> 02:10:08,890
A lost man.

5216
02:10:08,891 --> 02:10:09,790
Lost a fight.

5217
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:10,870
But that was her eyes.

5218
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:11,111
Yeah,

5219
02:10:11,111 --> 02:10:11,231
yeah,

5220
02:10:11,231 --> 02:10:11,411
yeah.

5221
02:10:11,411 --> 02:10:13,180
Like he played the video for us,

5222
02:10:13,181 --> 02:10:13,661
but you know,

5223
02:10:13,661 --> 02:10:14,320
he just sort of put,

5224
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:15,460
it was a block boxing club.

5225
02:10:15,461 --> 02:10:17,230
We just to put us in a
room and there was no ring.

5226
02:10:17,231 --> 02:10:17,970
It was just like,

5227
02:10:17,970 --> 02:10:18,761
and there was one guy,

5228
02:10:18,761 --> 02:10:20,170
five all the fare the same height.

5229
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:20,591
So,

5230
02:10:20,591 --> 02:10:21,101
but that guy,

5231
02:10:21,101 --> 02:10:21,761
he outweighed me.

5232
02:10:21,761 --> 02:10:22,571
I was like six four,

5233
02:10:22,571 --> 02:10:24,220
one 90 he was like six four,

5234
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:25,000
you know,

5235
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,090
to 60 or something.

5236
02:10:26,130 --> 02:10:26,963
And it's like,

5237
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:28,930
I don't think we're
asking the same way class.

5238
02:10:29,290 --> 02:10:31,720
And he was the guy who was and he rocked
me and it was just that thing and I'd

5239
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:32,260
head gear on.

5240
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:32,830
I was like,

5241
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:33,171
Oh yeah,

5242
02:10:33,171 --> 02:10:33,771
that's is,

5243
02:10:33,771 --> 02:10:34,530
this is not a,

5244
02:10:34,530 --> 02:10:36,440
I think I'm a be these words.

5245
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:39,741
Yeah,

5246
02:10:39,741 --> 02:10:41,150
you could learn how to box,

5247
02:10:41,151 --> 02:10:42,920
but you got to learn how to box today,

5248
02:10:42,980 --> 02:10:44,450
especially in today's Day and age.

5249
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:48,500
You got to learn how to do it from
someone who respect brain trauma and

5250
02:10:48,501 --> 02:10:51,980
understands like the goal is not to just
go in there and beat the shit out of

5251
02:10:51,981 --> 02:10:53,600
each other and the strong person survives.

5252
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:56,240
The goal is to teach someone
how to move their head.

5253
02:10:56,241 --> 02:10:59,150
So they don't get hit when
he's got his right hand there.

5254
02:10:59,151 --> 02:11:00,740
That means the punch is coming this way.

5255
02:11:00,860 --> 02:11:04,070
I want you to duck under it and then you
counter and do everything nice and slow

5256
02:11:04,071 --> 02:11:04,880
at first.

5257
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:08,810
Develop the movements and then when you
spar spar in a very controlled way and

5258
02:11:08,811 --> 02:11:11,900
you'll actually get better at it and
then you know you could actually become a

5259
02:11:11,901 --> 02:11:12,734
real boxer.

5260
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,950
But the problem is a lot of these gyms,

5261
02:11:15,951 --> 02:11:16,400
they don't,

5262
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:17,570
they don't want pussies.

5263
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:20,000
I just take you and throw you in there.

5264
02:11:20,001 --> 02:11:20,151
Yeah,

5265
02:11:20,151 --> 02:11:20,984
it put lace them up.

5266
02:11:21,050 --> 02:11:21,883
Yeah.

5267
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:22,460
Yeah.

5268
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:24,650
Although now there's cardio
boxing where they are,

5269
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,870
which is not exactly what
you're talking about,

5270
02:11:26,871 --> 02:11:30,560
where it's like we're just pretending
to buck hitting bags mostly and they're

5271
02:11:30,561 --> 02:11:31,940
doing it with poor form.

5272
02:11:32,210 --> 02:11:35,210
I went to a cardio boxing class and I
was watching these people hit the bag of

5273
02:11:35,211 --> 02:11:35,571
Mcdonald's,

5274
02:11:35,571 --> 02:11:37,070
even telling them to do it right,

5275
02:11:37,490 --> 02:11:38,390
like everything they're doing,

5276
02:11:38,391 --> 02:11:39,920
they're all fucking whale in their arms,

5277
02:11:39,921 --> 02:11:42,290
all goofy and they're
not throwing their hips,

5278
02:11:42,710 --> 02:11:45,410
lifting their feet up when they
punch and no one's correcting him.

5279
02:11:45,590 --> 02:11:45,920
I'm like,

5280
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:46,910
this is not boxing.

5281
02:11:46,911 --> 02:11:48,020
This is just hitting shit.

5282
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:50,060
It ain't shit is exercise.

5283
02:11:50,070 --> 02:11:50,900
You know,

5284
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:52,430
can't even call it cardio boxing.

5285
02:11:53,590 --> 02:11:54,020
Um,

5286
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:54,471
but it,

5287
02:11:54,471 --> 02:11:56,610
it is interesting what you said about the,

5288
02:11:56,640 --> 02:11:57,710
the heavyweight division,

5289
02:11:57,950 --> 02:12:00,680
the heavyweight division being
this division that's sort of,

5290
02:12:00,681 --> 02:12:04,160
but you still have guys like
Adrian Broner that are coming up.

5291
02:12:04,160 --> 02:12:05,170
You'd still have guide.

5292
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:07,820
I have not paid attention a long time
because it sort of became a thing where it

5293
02:12:07,821 --> 02:12:08,240
just,

5294
02:12:08,240 --> 02:12:09,350
it was just felt like a desert,

5295
02:12:09,351 --> 02:12:10,630
but it's just a heavyweight division.

5296
02:12:10,631 --> 02:12:10,760
Yeah.

5297
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:10,971
No,

5298
02:12:10,971 --> 02:12:11,210
no.

5299
02:12:11,210 --> 02:12:11,931
I will,

5300
02:12:11,931 --> 02:12:13,050
I will watch many packages.

5301
02:12:13,220 --> 02:12:16,310
Fucking Russians have a
stranglehold on that mother fucker.

5302
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:16,941
Yeah.

5303
02:12:16,941 --> 02:12:17,630
They're not letting it go.

5304
02:12:17,630 --> 02:12:18,470
It'll be interesting to see,

5305
02:12:18,471 --> 02:12:19,370
cause he's still the champ,

5306
02:12:19,371 --> 02:12:19,610
right?

5307
02:12:19,610 --> 02:12:20,750
Klitschko Oh yeah.

5308
02:12:21,050 --> 02:12:21,490
When he,

5309
02:12:21,490 --> 02:12:22,460
cause he's pretty old too.

5310
02:12:22,461 --> 02:12:23,360
He's not a young dude.

5311
02:12:23,361 --> 02:12:24,194
He was like 40.

5312
02:12:24,210 --> 02:12:24,491
Yeah.

5313
02:12:24,491 --> 02:12:25,520
But when he retires,

5314
02:12:25,521 --> 02:12:26,480
like what happens?

5315
02:12:26,481 --> 02:12:27,314
Like what,

5316
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:27,800
you know,

5317
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:31,010
I think that boxing could use a
central organization that sort of like,

5318
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:32,100
it's never going to happen.

5319
02:12:32,100 --> 02:12:32,390
No,

5320
02:12:32,390 --> 02:12:32,641
no.

5321
02:12:32,641 --> 02:12:33,250
And I think that's,

5322
02:12:33,250 --> 02:12:33,711
you know why?

5323
02:12:33,711 --> 02:12:35,590
Because you can start
your own organization.

5324
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:36,080
The ghetto.

5325
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:37,160
That's what I'm going to start to.

5326
02:12:37,790 --> 02:12:41,600
MMA has done it in a way
where like if you organized a,

5327
02:12:41,601 --> 02:12:42,081
an event,

5328
02:12:42,081 --> 02:12:43,700
like you call it the WTF,

5329
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:44,151
oh,

5330
02:12:44,151 --> 02:12:44,990
whatever the fuck it is,

5331
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:48,350
and you decided to have
an event and you say,

5332
02:12:48,351 --> 02:12:50,870
this is my w fo world champion.

5333
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:52,550
That's a world champion.

5334
02:12:52,551 --> 02:12:54,980
That's what the WBA does for boxing.

5335
02:12:54,981 --> 02:12:55,701
The IBF,

5336
02:12:55,701 --> 02:12:56,271
the Ibo,

5337
02:12:56,271 --> 02:12:57,530
there's all these different organizations.

5338
02:12:57,531 --> 02:12:58,364
WBC,

5339
02:12:58,940 --> 02:12:59,840
UFC.

5340
02:12:59,841 --> 02:13:01,010
Is that the thing?

5341
02:13:01,070 --> 02:13:06,050
It's like the NFL super bowl
champion is a fucking NFL champion.

5342
02:13:06,080 --> 02:13:06,231
Yeah.

5343
02:13:06,231 --> 02:13:07,130
There's no question that the,

5344
02:13:07,190 --> 02:13:09,830
whoever wins the super bowl is the
best football team in the world at that

5345
02:13:09,831 --> 02:13:10,131
point.

5346
02:13:10,131 --> 02:13:11,050
There's not somebody in,

5347
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:12,140
there's not a football team in Europe.

5348
02:13:12,170 --> 02:13:12,381
It's like,

5349
02:13:12,381 --> 02:13:12,621
no,

5350
02:13:12,621 --> 02:13:13,460
we could actually,

5351
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:14,211
exactly.

5352
02:13:14,211 --> 02:13:14,510
Yeah.

5353
02:13:14,510 --> 02:13:17,780
And the problem is with boxing is there's
just so many organizations and once

5354
02:13:17,781 --> 02:13:19,580
that happens you can't take it back.

5355
02:13:19,910 --> 02:13:20,180
No,

5356
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:21,770
you can't get all those
people together and say,

5357
02:13:21,771 --> 02:13:21,921
hey,

5358
02:13:21,921 --> 02:13:25,760
let's all form one organization and
we'll split the money but the fuck out of

5359
02:13:25,761 --> 02:13:25,970
you.

5360
02:13:25,970 --> 02:13:26,541
And that's the,

5361
02:13:26,541 --> 02:13:26,871
again,

5362
02:13:26,871 --> 02:13:29,180
it's the everybody wants the
money is what dictates the thing.

5363
02:13:29,181 --> 02:13:29,920
So they,

5364
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:30,170
I mean,

5365
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:31,980
I remember when unifying
the title was three

5366
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:32,521
titles.

5367
02:13:32,521 --> 02:13:33,030
Yup.

5368
02:13:33,030 --> 02:13:34,170
It was the WBA,

5369
02:13:34,171 --> 02:13:35,490
the WBC and IBF.

5370
02:13:35,780 --> 02:13:39,870
IBF was late in the game around
like the eighties I believe.

5371
02:13:39,871 --> 02:13:40,021
Yeah.

5372
02:13:40,021 --> 02:13:41,760
I remember when people resist both.

5373
02:13:41,761 --> 02:13:42,870
I think he threw it in the trash.

5374
02:13:42,871 --> 02:13:44,940
Get through one of the titles
of the Trashcan and yeah,

5375
02:13:46,790 --> 02:13:47,620
big deal.

5376
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:48,270
Yeah.

5377
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:49,103
Yeah.

5378
02:13:49,590 --> 02:13:50,401
Ridiculous.

5379
02:13:50,401 --> 02:13:51,570
Sanctioning fees.

5380
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,590
The sanction fees to fight for a
WPA test fucking through the roof.

5381
02:13:55,591 --> 02:13:56,700
It's crazy money.

5382
02:13:56,980 --> 02:13:57,813
Like for what are you,

5383
02:13:57,900 --> 02:13:58,733
what are you fucking,

5384
02:13:59,010 --> 02:14:03,780
what am I getting that given you $1
million and what the fuck are you getting?

5385
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:04,711
This is again,

5386
02:14:04,711 --> 02:14:05,131
it's the,

5387
02:14:05,131 --> 02:14:05,964
it's the,

5388
02:14:06,070 --> 02:14:06,600
that's the,

5389
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:08,910
I mean maybe some wouldn't
call it corruption,

5390
02:14:08,911 --> 02:14:10,520
but I think that's the
corruption is everywhere.

5391
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:12,060
Trying to get as much of
the money as they can,

5392
02:14:12,240 --> 02:14:13,410
but it's not good for the sport.

5393
02:14:13,590 --> 02:14:14,311
You know what it should be,

5394
02:14:14,311 --> 02:14:14,581
man,

5395
02:14:14,581 --> 02:14:16,290
it should be like ring magazine.

5396
02:14:16,650 --> 02:14:17,011
Yes.

5397
02:14:17,011 --> 02:14:17,280
You know,

5398
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:18,660
ring magazine has a rank champion.

5399
02:14:18,661 --> 02:14:20,520
I don't think they have to
pay to be the ring champion.

5400
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:22,110
I should abandon everything.

5401
02:14:22,111 --> 02:14:23,100
But the ring title,

5402
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:25,260
ring magazine is not
going to do your dirty.

5403
02:14:25,261 --> 02:14:25,500
They,

5404
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:26,333
they're there.

5405
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:27,810
They want the sport to be good,

5406
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:29,010
they want the best.

5407
02:14:29,011 --> 02:14:30,590
And I think that that's
the problem with the edit.

5408
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:31,650
There's my in it.

5409
02:14:31,650 --> 02:14:32,130
Yeah.

5410
02:14:32,130 --> 02:14:35,120
There's money in deciding who's the WBC,

5411
02:14:35,130 --> 02:14:36,000
the WBA.

5412
02:14:36,001 --> 02:14:37,560
It's that unchecked capitalism thing.

5413
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:39,720
Communism as a point.

5414
02:14:40,030 --> 02:14:40,863
Yeah.

5415
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:43,980
I enjoy this phone that was
made by Chinese children,

5416
02:14:44,030 --> 02:14:47,820
but I also think that we should
probably pay them a living wage.

5417
02:14:47,821 --> 02:14:48,570
You know,

5418
02:14:48,570 --> 02:14:49,590
you gotta make good phones,

5419
02:14:49,591 --> 02:14:50,640
but let's pay them a living wage.

5420
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:53,910
Whenever you have nets around the building
where you work to keep people from

5421
02:14:53,911 --> 02:14:54,721
jumping off the roof,

5422
02:14:54,721 --> 02:14:57,420
cause there's so many fucking people
jumping off that you'd need nets.

5423
02:14:57,480 --> 02:14:58,020
Yes.

5424
02:14:58,020 --> 02:14:58,261
Yeah.

5425
02:14:58,261 --> 02:14:58,661
Maybe.

5426
02:14:58,661 --> 02:15:00,090
Maybe we should think we
should look into this.

5427
02:15:00,260 --> 02:15:00,590
Yeah.

5428
02:15:00,590 --> 02:15:00,811
Yeah.

5429
02:15:00,811 --> 02:15:01,644
Maybe we should.

5430
02:15:02,190 --> 02:15:02,611
Do you,

5431
02:15:02,611 --> 02:15:03,420
um,

5432
02:15:03,420 --> 02:15:04,950
do you think there's a way around that?

5433
02:15:04,951 --> 02:15:05,520
Because that's,

5434
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:08,940
that's drives me nuts
about not just cell phones,

5435
02:15:08,941 --> 02:15:13,260
but about like people that drive Prius's
and Shit and say that I'm helping the

5436
02:15:13,261 --> 02:15:13,741
environment,

5437
02:15:13,741 --> 02:15:14,850
I'm being socially conscious.

5438
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:17,790
And you're also driving a fucking
box filled with conflict minerals.

5439
02:15:18,290 --> 02:15:19,123
Yeah,

5440
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:23,430
every fucking lithium ion crystal and
that came out of a fucking mine in the

5441
02:15:23,431 --> 02:15:26,250
ground in Africa and it's likely a child
that might have been pulling it out.

5442
02:15:26,390 --> 02:15:26,700
You know,

5443
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:29,100
somebody said to me that day because of
my act in the way I talk about things

5444
02:15:29,101 --> 02:15:30,150
like how would you identify yourself?

5445
02:15:30,170 --> 02:15:31,940
You were socialist and your
comment is like not do that.

5446
02:15:31,941 --> 02:15:34,290
He's went to the apple store
and got me an iPod touch.

5447
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:36,503
I'm a very,

5448
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:37,380
I'm a very proud,

5449
02:15:37,650 --> 02:15:38,940
maybe a reluctant capitalist,

5450
02:15:38,941 --> 02:15:40,290
but I also like a nice house too.

5451
02:15:40,290 --> 02:15:40,950
I just,

5452
02:15:40,950 --> 02:15:42,960
I just think that there's ethics,

5453
02:15:43,170 --> 02:15:43,980
there's ethics rules.

5454
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:46,200
Like if I'm like when I go to pay,

5455
02:15:46,230 --> 02:15:49,680
when I went to go try to buy a new phone
and they said it's going to be $700 if

5456
02:15:49,681 --> 02:15:50,100
I,

5457
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:55,100
if I thought that that's $700 was actually
going to a living wage for somebody,

5458
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:55,801
maybe,

5459
02:15:55,801 --> 02:15:56,670
I don't know if I buy it,

5460
02:15:56,671 --> 02:15:57,391
but I would think about it,

5461
02:15:57,391 --> 02:15:59,370
but I know it's like you're
just making up a price.

5462
02:15:59,410 --> 02:15:59,970
Yeah.

5463
02:15:59,970 --> 02:16:01,340
This is not actually a pot,

5464
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:03,570
like we're probably paying
too little for our phones.

5465
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,910
They should probably all be
twice as much as they are,

5466
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:10,320
but we all had this thing where I want
the 50 isn't it $50 with the free rebate

5467
02:16:10,321 --> 02:16:10,860
or something?

5468
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:11,160
Right.

5469
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:11,993
We want that,

5470
02:16:12,090 --> 02:16:13,830
but that's a problem because that doesn't,

5471
02:16:13,860 --> 02:16:15,030
that doesn't help the world.

5472
02:16:15,031 --> 02:16:16,620
It's the same thing with like with like,

5473
02:16:16,621 --> 02:16:17,010
uh,

5474
02:16:17,010 --> 02:16:17,880
the minimum wage,

5475
02:16:17,881 --> 02:16:18,830
raising the minimum wage.

5476
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:21,030
If you raise the minimum wage,

5477
02:16:21,031 --> 02:16:22,410
you have less job turnover.

5478
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:23,940
If people have more pride in their job,

5479
02:16:23,941 --> 02:16:26,730
because we have customer services sucks
in this country because the dude got

5480
02:16:26,731 --> 02:16:30,490
hired two days ago and he's looking and
he's looking a new job isn't there also

5481
02:16:30,491 --> 02:16:33,530
like when you look at the amount of profit
that apple has made and probably the

5482
02:16:33,550 --> 02:16:36,850
apple has something like $60
billion in the fucking bank,

5483
02:16:36,851 --> 02:16:41,620
like how much would you have in the bank
if you paid people more money to make

5484
02:16:41,621 --> 02:16:44,410
those phones and you made them in
America and you made less profit,

5485
02:16:44,411 --> 02:16:47,590
but the people all made a living
wage like can we worked out on paper?

5486
02:16:47,610 --> 02:16:49,120
That's so I can see what that would be.

5487
02:16:49,140 --> 02:16:49,250
Well,

5488
02:16:49,250 --> 02:16:49,691
it's the same thing.

5489
02:16:49,691 --> 02:16:50,680
It's the same thing with Walmart.

5490
02:16:50,681 --> 02:16:51,421
Like they,

5491
02:16:51,421 --> 02:16:52,030
they,

5492
02:16:52,030 --> 02:16:54,310
if they paid everybody like $12 an hour,

5493
02:16:54,311 --> 02:16:54,730
they would,

5494
02:16:54,730 --> 02:16:56,390
they would make like $3 billion.

5495
02:16:56,420 --> 02:16:57,011
Like it's still,

5496
02:16:57,011 --> 02:16:57,181
yeah.

5497
02:16:57,181 --> 02:17:00,550
It's not like how much profit do
you need to make and at some point,

5498
02:17:00,730 --> 02:17:02,290
and I get that you're
allowed to set the price,

5499
02:17:02,310 --> 02:17:02,801
whatever you want.

5500
02:17:02,801 --> 02:17:03,640
I feel like I'm some market,

5501
02:17:03,670 --> 02:17:04,870
I'm talking to my dad right now.

5502
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:05,470
Yeah.

5503
02:17:05,470 --> 02:17:06,770
Like my dad has a bargain,

5504
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:08,380
but we all have to agree.

5505
02:17:08,381 --> 02:17:12,160
We live in a society that we're not
individuals living in our little islands,

5506
02:17:12,161 --> 02:17:14,290
but I think corporations
treat it like I am.

5507
02:17:14,470 --> 02:17:16,150
We are all our own little country.

5508
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:16,631
Well,

5509
02:17:16,631 --> 02:17:20,260
there's a reason why there's something
like a minimum wage and that we all kind

5510
02:17:20,261 --> 02:17:24,490
of agree there should be some minimum
wage is because corporations have no

5511
02:17:24,491 --> 02:17:25,540
fucking soul.

5512
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:26,121
No.

5513
02:17:26,121 --> 02:17:27,340
It just about money.

5514
02:17:27,380 --> 02:17:29,510
They're about bottom line in there.

5515
02:17:29,530 --> 02:17:30,131
In fact,

5516
02:17:30,131 --> 02:17:34,660
their duty to their shareholders is to
increase their bottom line and they have

5517
02:17:34,661 --> 02:17:35,650
to make more every year.

5518
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:36,180
Yes.

5519
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:36,340
Yeah.

5520
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:36,671
They can't.

5521
02:17:36,671 --> 02:17:36,821
Yeah.

5522
02:17:36,821 --> 02:17:37,720
They can't have flat,

5523
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:38,860
they can't have flat growth.

5524
02:17:38,890 --> 02:17:40,030
They have to Harris,

5525
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:41,800
we made $1 billion last year.

5526
02:17:41,801 --> 02:17:43,210
We only made $1 billion this year.

5527
02:17:43,211 --> 02:17:44,170
What's happening down there?

5528
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:46,630
What's happened to those
kids in that factory?

5529
02:17:46,650 --> 02:17:47,230
Yeah,

5530
02:17:47,230 --> 02:17:48,063
they need to make less.

5531
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:49,180
And so the,

5532
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:50,530
the thing that I think is like,

5533
02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:53,110
and the thing with the minimum wage is
that it hasn't kept up with inflation.

5534
02:17:53,111 --> 02:17:56,050
If minimum wage is tracked with
the ICAN with inflation and the,

5535
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:56,951
it would be fine,

5536
02:17:56,951 --> 02:17:58,000
but it has not kept up.

5537
02:17:58,001 --> 02:17:58,834
And so,

5538
02:17:59,020 --> 02:18:01,630
and you know my dad who
I've talked to my dad,

5539
02:18:01,631 --> 02:18:01,991
but it was like,

5540
02:18:01,991 --> 02:18:02,710
well that's,

5541
02:18:02,710 --> 02:18:04,180
those jobs are pass through jobs.

5542
02:18:04,181 --> 02:18:05,880
You're not supposed to have
work at Walmart forever.

5543
02:18:06,010 --> 02:18:06,191
Hey,

5544
02:18:06,191 --> 02:18:07,480
the factory left town.

5545
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:08,020
Yeah.

5546
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:10,870
There's no good union jobs and there's
not a lot of good union jobs where you

5547
02:18:10,871 --> 02:18:14,050
can work at the GM factory for 25
years and retire with a gold watch.

5548
02:18:14,070 --> 02:18:14,710
Yeah.

5549
02:18:14,710 --> 02:18:15,760
Walmart is the factor.

5550
02:18:15,761 --> 02:18:19,030
I feel like there's some jobs
that are really good for kids.

5551
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:22,000
There's some jobs and kids just get out
of high school and they have an entry

5552
02:18:22,001 --> 02:18:22,860
level job there.

5553
02:18:22,861 --> 02:18:25,840
There are some jobs that probably
shouldn't pay a shitload of money,

5554
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:26,530
but no,

5555
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:27,160
not a shitload,

5556
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:27,551
but they should.

5557
02:18:27,551 --> 02:18:27,820
Yeah.

5558
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:29,170
If you're working all week,

5559
02:18:29,230 --> 02:18:30,430
you should be able to live on that.

5560
02:18:30,490 --> 02:18:30,881
Yes.

5561
02:18:30,881 --> 02:18:31,450
Yes.

5562
02:18:31,450 --> 02:18:33,580
If you fulltime work,

5563
02:18:33,581 --> 02:18:34,930
you should be able to afford to,

5564
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,750
he should be able to eat and you should
be able to sleep somewhere and the,

5565
02:18:37,751 --> 02:18:41,170
and the government should want you to
be able to be able to actually not just

5566
02:18:41,171 --> 02:18:41,831
live for yourself,

5567
02:18:41,831 --> 02:18:44,740
but also be married and have an afford
to be married and afford to have a kid

5568
02:18:44,870 --> 02:18:47,560
having two kids because
that all feeds the economy.

5569
02:18:47,950 --> 02:18:51,100
Like you shouldn't want somebody
to be struggling and not afford to.

5570
02:18:51,310 --> 02:18:53,950
I guess we can to have a
kid and I guess or whatever.

5571
02:18:53,951 --> 02:18:56,680
We can only have one cause I guess
you need a better job come out.

5572
02:18:57,800 --> 02:19:00,970
She need to get out of North
Dakota somehow and find
yourself a good place where

5573
02:19:00,971 --> 02:19:01,870
you can get a good income.

5574
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:02,441
Exactly.

5575
02:19:02,441 --> 02:19:03,221
I moved to San Francisco.

5576
02:19:03,221 --> 02:19:04,054
You can't afford to live.

5577
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:04,710
Yeah.

5578
02:19:04,710 --> 02:19:06,430
We didn't get a $4 million shack.

5579
02:19:06,460 --> 02:19:06,821
Yeah.

5580
02:19:06,821 --> 02:19:07,570
So I did that.

5581
02:19:07,570 --> 02:19:08,470
It's such a,

5582
02:19:08,830 --> 02:19:10,630
it's to me that's so clear that like,

5583
02:19:10,631 --> 02:19:11,110
no,

5584
02:19:11,110 --> 02:19:14,330
if we raise the minimum wage it helps
the economy certainly sends her.

5585
02:19:14,331 --> 02:19:17,530
But I have a small business and if I
raised them in which your employees won't

5586
02:19:17,531 --> 02:19:18,191
be so shitty,

5587
02:19:18,191 --> 02:19:20,770
that's what will happen and
they won't quit every two weeks.

5588
02:19:20,860 --> 02:19:22,330
How much money should it be though?

5589
02:19:22,540 --> 02:19:23,830
What should the minimum wage be?

5590
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:24,730
I think I,

5591
02:19:24,730 --> 02:19:25,420
I,

5592
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:27,190
I mean I'm not an economist,

5593
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:31,670
but I think $15 an hour is not
outside the bounds of no reasonable.

5594
02:19:31,670 --> 02:19:32,480
For somebody who's like,

5595
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:35,300
and I think I don't even have a
problem if you track it to the city.

5596
02:19:35,301 --> 02:19:37,640
Like I think some cities
you need $17 an hour.

5597
02:19:37,641 --> 02:19:39,610
In some cities maybe you need 12 right.

5598
02:19:39,650 --> 02:19:39,941
You know,

5599
02:19:39,941 --> 02:19:41,130
I think that's just the,

5600
02:19:41,150 --> 02:19:41,480
the,

5601
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:42,150
the way,

5602
02:19:42,150 --> 02:19:43,110
cause like San Francisco,

5603
02:19:43,580 --> 02:19:47,780
San Francisco has a higher minimum wage
then the Nash than the national minimum

5604
02:19:47,781 --> 02:19:48,200
wage.

5605
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:48,620
Does it?

5606
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:49,310
Yes.

5607
02:19:49,310 --> 02:19:50,060
It's like,

5608
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:50,421
I forget,

5609
02:19:50,421 --> 02:19:51,350
I don't know what the national mood,

5610
02:19:51,351 --> 02:19:52,610
but San Francisco is
like bucks or something.

5611
02:19:52,611 --> 02:19:55,250
It's like eight 50 I think
because they know that it's still,

5612
02:19:55,710 --> 02:19:57,500
it's fucking San Francisco,

5613
02:19:57,530 --> 02:19:57,841
you know,

5614
02:19:57,841 --> 02:19:58,040
it's,

5615
02:19:58,040 --> 02:19:58,310
they,

5616
02:19:58,310 --> 02:19:59,680
they are aware and it's still present.

5617
02:19:59,690 --> 02:20:00,381
It's still not enough,

5618
02:20:00,381 --> 02:20:02,300
but at least there's the service about,

5619
02:20:02,301 --> 02:20:03,340
we realized that this is the,

5620
02:20:03,370 --> 02:20:05,090
the city is not North Dakota.

5621
02:20:05,330 --> 02:20:08,630
There's three things that you bring up
when people go fucking bananas about

5622
02:20:09,110 --> 02:20:10,250
climate change,

5623
02:20:10,910 --> 02:20:13,160
racism and minimum wage.

5624
02:20:13,220 --> 02:20:14,900
And we've talked about all three of them.

5625
02:20:15,060 --> 02:20:15,750
All right?

5626
02:20:15,750 --> 02:20:17,960
When you start talking about minimum wage,

5627
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:20,750
the fucking quote
unquote economic experts,

5628
02:20:21,050 --> 02:20:21,830
by the way,

5629
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:22,970
here's what I've noticed.

5630
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:24,650
Most of them aren't rich.

5631
02:20:25,050 --> 02:20:25,860
One of the people,

5632
02:20:25,860 --> 02:20:28,550
the people that fucking chime
in on these discussions.

5633
02:20:28,551 --> 02:20:32,360
I've had deep conversations with these
people like back and forth for a long

5634
02:20:32,361 --> 02:20:32,661
time,

5635
02:20:32,661 --> 02:20:35,540
but I know zero about economics.

5636
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:37,100
And so when I've said,

5637
02:20:37,101 --> 02:20:37,311
hey,

5638
02:20:37,311 --> 02:20:40,460
I just think that people should be able
to live on the amount of money that they

5639
02:20:40,461 --> 02:20:41,180
make during the week,

5640
02:20:41,180 --> 02:20:44,360
and people come up with all these
reasons why that's bullshit and all these

5641
02:20:44,361 --> 02:20:46,250
reasons why that's bad for
business and all these years.

5642
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:47,990
And I eventually,

5643
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:52,070
in the conversation I get
to how much do you make?

5644
02:20:52,460 --> 02:20:53,300
What do you do?

5645
02:20:53,560 --> 02:20:54,021
Are you,

5646
02:20:54,021 --> 02:20:55,490
do you run a business or you know,

5647
02:20:55,491 --> 02:20:56,990
none of them run buck and businesses.

5648
02:20:57,110 --> 02:21:01,190
They all have this idea in their head
that America is filled with people.

5649
02:21:01,250 --> 02:21:01,461
And I've,

5650
02:21:01,461 --> 02:21:02,660
I've read this quote somewhere,

5651
02:21:02,661 --> 02:21:03,460
I forget who to,

5652
02:21:03,460 --> 02:21:07,670
who to attribute it to that think that
they are about to become a millionaire

5653
02:21:07,940 --> 02:21:11,030
and they want to make sure
there's no laws in place.

5654
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:14,030
They're going to fuck them over
once they become a millionaire.

5655
02:21:14,060 --> 02:21:14,360
Yeah,

5656
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:14,601
no,

5657
02:21:14,601 --> 02:21:14,811
it's,

5658
02:21:14,811 --> 02:21:15,321
it's the,

5659
02:21:15,321 --> 02:21:16,131
it's people.

5660
02:21:16,131 --> 02:21:19,310
It's the reason why people vote against
their own personal interest because I'm

5661
02:21:19,311 --> 02:21:20,510
going to vote with the,

5662
02:21:20,511 --> 02:21:21,470
then I'm not trying to,

5663
02:21:21,710 --> 02:21:24,650
but I'm going to vote with the
Republican party because they have,

5664
02:21:24,651 --> 02:21:26,000
they don't want taxes.

5665
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:27,830
And one day I'm going to be
rich and I'm not going to what?

5666
02:21:27,831 --> 02:21:28,400
Taxes.

5667
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:29,031
Even though it's like,

5668
02:21:29,031 --> 02:21:31,550
well right now you're getting
you some taxes might help you.

5669
02:21:31,551 --> 02:21:32,061
You know what I mean?

5670
02:21:32,061 --> 02:21:32,894
Like it would help you.

5671
02:21:32,950 --> 02:21:34,400
It would help your community
and your neighborhood.

5672
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:34,701
But no,

5673
02:21:34,701 --> 02:21:35,690
I'm one day.

5674
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:39,170
So we're just thinking the world is a
people that are republican that are broke,

5675
02:21:39,171 --> 02:21:41,480
that are voting for corporate interests.

5676
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:41,760
Yes.

5677
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:42,050
Yes.

5678
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:43,340
It's like what are you doing?

5679
02:21:43,341 --> 02:21:45,380
Cause people think that
everybody thinks they're one.

5680
02:21:45,381 --> 02:21:45,900
Not Everybody.

5681
02:21:45,900 --> 02:21:48,460
A lot of people think they're one lottery
ticket away from being in the 1% or

5682
02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:51,410
one step or one or one.

5683
02:21:51,570 --> 02:21:52,900
One jump shot one.

5684
02:21:53,470 --> 02:21:53,940
Yeah.

5685
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:54,231
Yeah.

5686
02:21:54,231 --> 02:21:54,800
So,

5687
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:59,270
but it's weird how the Republican
Party is like a party that supports big

5688
02:21:59,271 --> 02:21:59,781
business,

5689
02:21:59,781 --> 02:22:01,070
like sort of unequivocably.

5690
02:22:01,250 --> 02:22:04,510
Yet they're more supported
by under in colic,

5691
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:06,620
lower income conservative people.

5692
02:22:06,680 --> 02:22:09,920
It's the reason why people who don't
live in New York like the Yankees,

5693
02:22:09,921 --> 02:22:11,030
because they feel like they're the best.

5694
02:22:11,031 --> 02:22:11,181
They're,

5695
02:22:11,181 --> 02:22:11,870
they're the,

5696
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:12,890
they're the winning team.

5697
02:22:13,490 --> 02:22:14,870
And even though it's not connected to,

5698
02:22:14,871 --> 02:22:16,130
even though it's not connected to them,

5699
02:22:16,131 --> 02:22:17,670
they just feel like I want
to be with the winners.

5700
02:22:17,690 --> 02:22:17,961
Also,

5701
02:22:17,961 --> 02:22:22,820
the team that is most aligned with
Jesus is the Yankees wasn't publicans.

5702
02:22:22,990 --> 02:22:23,270
Oh,

5703
02:22:23,270 --> 02:22:23,751
Republicans,

5704
02:22:23,751 --> 02:22:24,020
yes.

5705
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:24,420
No.

5706
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:24,810
Well,

5707
02:22:24,810 --> 02:22:25,351
Republicans,

5708
02:22:25,351 --> 02:22:26,184
by tying

5709
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:31,050
patriotism to God that's swept the
whole bunch of people in there.

5710
02:22:31,051 --> 02:22:33,330
I saw a sign in Alabama that said America,

5711
02:22:33,331 --> 02:22:34,200
bless God,

5712
02:22:34,740 --> 02:22:35,940
I don't even know what that means,

5713
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:38,340
but that was a billboard
that I saw that was sort of,

5714
02:22:38,510 --> 02:22:39,030
so we're like,

5715
02:22:39,030 --> 02:22:39,241
wait,

5716
02:22:39,241 --> 02:22:40,074
we're,

5717
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:41,400
yes,

5718
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:42,300
we got was America.

5719
02:22:42,330 --> 02:22:43,680
But it was actually like putting,

5720
02:22:43,681 --> 02:22:44,371
it was sort of saying,

5721
02:22:44,371 --> 02:22:44,551
no,

5722
02:22:44,551 --> 02:22:46,500
we made as the god of
Americans to God and,

5723
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:47,131
and I was like,

5724
02:22:47,131 --> 02:22:48,030
I'm not sure what that means,

5725
02:22:48,031 --> 02:22:49,950
but clearly I don't think I
want to rent a house here.

5726
02:22:50,090 --> 02:22:52,200
America is better than the
creator of the universe.

5727
02:22:52,201 --> 02:22:52,541
Yeah,

5728
02:22:52,541 --> 02:22:52,700
yeah,

5729
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:53,360
yeah.

5730
02:22:53,360 --> 02:22:54,570
You believe in the
creator of the universe.

5731
02:22:54,680 --> 02:22:56,010
America's better than that.

5732
02:22:56,190 --> 02:22:58,620
So we bless the creator of the universe,

5733
02:22:58,860 --> 02:22:59,790
keeps a little pat on the head.

5734
02:22:59,791 --> 02:23:00,624
God,

5735
02:23:01,350 --> 02:23:02,910
good job making that she
didn't take it from here.

5736
02:23:02,911 --> 02:23:03,100
Yeah.

5737
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:03,933
Yeah.

5738
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:06,870
I see a new American US Logan,

5739
02:23:06,871 --> 02:23:07,704
we'll take it from here.

5740
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:08,970
America blessed.

5741
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:09,121
Oh,

5742
02:23:09,121 --> 02:23:09,954
there it is.

5743
02:23:10,170 --> 02:23:12,540
Eh bless God.

5744
02:23:12,541 --> 02:23:13,530
I need you at my house.

5745
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:15,630
Look at that fucking billboard.

5746
02:23:15,930 --> 02:23:16,321
Meanwhile,

5747
02:23:16,321 --> 02:23:18,420
it's a conti flying lizard.

5748
02:23:20,190 --> 02:23:21,240
If you ever met her lizard,

5749
02:23:21,241 --> 02:23:21,571
I mean a,

5750
02:23:21,571 --> 02:23:22,250
an eagle.

5751
02:23:22,250 --> 02:23:22,440
No.

5752
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:23,190
You ever seen an eagle?

5753
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:23,610
No.

5754
02:23:23,610 --> 02:23:25,680
I saw one last summer for
the first time in real life.

5755
02:23:25,950 --> 02:23:28,110
And you look into the eyes
of that heartless monster.

5756
02:23:28,111 --> 02:23:28,441
You're like,

5757
02:23:28,441 --> 02:23:29,430
well how the fuck is this?

5758
02:23:29,431 --> 02:23:30,570
Our National Bird?

5759
02:23:30,890 --> 02:23:31,240
Yeah,

5760
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:32,460
our national and crazy.

5761
02:23:32,461 --> 02:23:32,851
A little bit.

5762
02:23:32,851 --> 02:23:34,400
Or there dinosaurs,

5763
02:23:35,170 --> 02:23:36,260
dinosaurs that survived.

5764
02:23:36,390 --> 02:23:36,680
If you,

5765
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:38,490
if you pulled away all the feathers,

5766
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:39,380
and by the way,

5767
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:39,690
uh,

5768
02:23:39,690 --> 02:23:41,580
they think that most
dinosaurs had feathers.

5769
02:23:41,581 --> 02:23:44,670
Now they're starting to reconsider
the idea of dinosaurs and feathers.

5770
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:46,530
I do think a lot of
dinosaurs had feathers,

5771
02:23:46,531 --> 02:23:48,330
so they essentially are fucking dinosaurs.

5772
02:23:48,390 --> 02:23:51,600
So that gives Steven Spielberg way to
rerelease all the Jurassic Park movies

5773
02:23:51,630 --> 02:23:51,871
now,

5774
02:23:51,871 --> 02:23:52,531
which feathers,

5775
02:23:52,531 --> 02:23:54,450
you don't know what the
fuck was on those things.

5776
02:23:54,450 --> 02:23:55,860
They don't know what color they were.

5777
02:23:56,070 --> 02:23:57,600
They know they had some sort of skin,

5778
02:23:57,810 --> 02:23:58,800
but all they have is bones.

5779
02:23:58,801 --> 02:23:59,790
And that's speculation,

5780
02:23:59,791 --> 02:24:00,900
but in more,

5781
02:24:00,901 --> 02:24:01,530
and we like,

5782
02:24:01,530 --> 02:24:03,100
we like to think our lizards are green,

5783
02:24:03,101 --> 02:24:03,651
so we just make it.

5784
02:24:03,651 --> 02:24:04,010
Yeah.

5785
02:24:04,010 --> 02:24:04,590
Yeah.

5786
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:08,370
Well they also think that
at t rex might've been like
vulture shaped or vulture

5787
02:24:08,371 --> 02:24:08,701
colored,

5788
02:24:08,701 --> 02:24:12,570
like bright red faced and black body
because they think that he might've been

5789
02:24:12,571 --> 02:24:16,020
like intimidating because
they think he was more of a,

5790
02:24:16,530 --> 02:24:19,260
they think it was more
of instead of a Predator,

5791
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:20,850
he was more of a carrion eater.

5792
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:21,121
He was,

5793
02:24:21,121 --> 02:24:25,260
he probably stole away from somebody
else who killed it because his body's all

5794
02:24:25,261 --> 02:24:27,000
fucked up the way it doesn't have.

5795
02:24:27,001 --> 02:24:28,650
The arms can't really run that good.

5796
02:24:28,651 --> 02:24:28,830
They,

5797
02:24:28,830 --> 02:24:33,830
and they also speculate about the
earth's atmosphere being different than,

5798
02:24:34,060 --> 02:24:36,030
that's one of the reasons
why things grew so big.

5799
02:24:36,031 --> 02:24:38,670
It was a more oxygen rich
and dense atmosphere,

5800
02:24:39,210 --> 02:24:42,090
but they think that there's a
lot of dinosaurs had feathers,

5801
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:44,220
so a fucking eagle is a dinosaur.

5802
02:24:44,890 --> 02:24:48,240
So when you're looking at that
thing with a bolt cutter for a face,

5803
02:24:48,950 --> 02:24:53,370
like how was this heartless evil
baby steel and flying monster,

5804
02:24:54,210 --> 02:24:54,900
that's us.

5805
02:24:54,900 --> 02:24:55,733
That's America.

5806
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:57,031
There's some about that.

5807
02:24:57,031 --> 02:24:57,930
That sounds like America.

5808
02:25:01,300 --> 02:25:05,670
Sounds like an eagle flying into the
Foxconn factory in China and sweeping up

5809
02:25:05,671 --> 02:25:07,050
the iPhone and taking him away.

5810
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:11,070
That sounds kind of like us and the baby
in one hand just fucking drops it in

5811
02:25:11,071 --> 02:25:11,640
the ocean.

5812
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:12,250
Yeah.

5813
02:25:12,250 --> 02:25:13,920
That's sort of a thing that happens.

5814
02:25:14,420 --> 02:25:15,630
Talens is big,

5815
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:18,640
long or so that you're
not male fish never,

5816
02:25:18,710 --> 02:25:19,770
which not mentioning Joe's,

5817
02:25:20,190 --> 02:25:22,650
that's cavemen were also living
with them at the same time.

5818
02:25:22,651 --> 02:25:23,530
If you go to the writing,

5819
02:25:23,570 --> 02:25:24,310
you go to the creation

5820
02:25:24,310 --> 02:25:24,790
museum.

5821
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:25,390
Have you been,

5822
02:25:25,390 --> 02:25:27,520
I know I've been to that
area and heard about it,

5823
02:25:27,521 --> 02:25:27,880
but right.

5824
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:28,430
It's awesome.

5825
02:25:28,430 --> 02:25:29,080
Yeah.

5826
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:31,180
The creation museum is
supposed to be so awesome.

5827
02:25:31,510 --> 02:25:32,710
They have like these,

5828
02:25:32,770 --> 02:25:33,670
these lectures,

5829
02:25:33,671 --> 02:25:38,510
they explain how dinosaurs were
mentioned in the Bible and how yeah,

5830
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:40,180
and how they were all here together.

5831
02:25:40,210 --> 02:25:41,140
Did Noah forget them?

5832
02:25:41,141 --> 02:25:41,950
Is that what happened?

5833
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:42,950
They forgot them.

5834
02:25:43,070 --> 02:25:45,660
He was on the blowers were
late shit to dinosaurs.

5835
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:46,260
Dinosaurs,

5836
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:48,050
that dinosaur people time and

5837
02:25:51,100 --> 02:25:51,641
I,

5838
02:25:51,641 --> 02:25:52,040
yeah,

5839
02:25:52,040 --> 02:25:52,670
I,

5840
02:25:52,670 --> 02:25:57,010
I love when people get wacky ideas like
that in their head and they just ride

5841
02:25:57,011 --> 02:25:58,600
them out to the very end.

5842
02:25:58,660 --> 02:26:02,110
I think it's so funny because people
think that they're supposed to be able to

5843
02:26:02,111 --> 02:26:04,570
feed some people and especially
in religion it's sort of,

5844
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:05,140
you know,

5845
02:26:05,140 --> 02:26:07,330
think they're supposed to have
be able to figure everything out.

5846
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:08,610
Well no I can.

5847
02:26:08,670 --> 02:26:09,040
It's easy.

5848
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:10,870
Everything should be easily
explained to them and everything.

5849
02:26:10,871 --> 02:26:11,381
She'd be like,

5850
02:26:11,381 --> 02:26:11,610
no,

5851
02:26:11,610 --> 02:26:13,260
the most shit doesn't make sense.

5852
02:26:13,261 --> 02:26:14,140
It shouldn't make sense to you.

5853
02:26:14,350 --> 02:26:15,071
It doesn't have to make,

5854
02:26:15,071 --> 02:26:15,910
so you have a job.

5855
02:26:15,911 --> 02:26:17,320
That's the thing that's
supposed to make sense to you,

5856
02:26:17,321 --> 02:26:18,041
but everything else,

5857
02:26:18,041 --> 02:26:20,950
you don't have to know the why
things work the way they are.

5858
02:26:20,951 --> 02:26:21,910
Unless that's your job.

5859
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:23,260
Well that's science,

5860
02:26:23,261 --> 02:26:23,860
handle it.

5861
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:26,260
There's a lot of people working on that
shit is also a lot of people that like

5862
02:26:26,261 --> 02:26:27,094
an attribute,

5863
02:26:27,460 --> 02:26:32,460
like really complex mechanisms
to like impossibility.

5864
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:33,281
Like they say,

5865
02:26:33,281 --> 02:26:38,281
you're telling me that six 14
whatever it was billion years ago,

5866
02:26:39,820 --> 02:26:44,820
something created the universe add a
nothing and then from there you can see

5867
02:26:46,151 --> 02:26:47,440
with your eyes like,

5868
02:26:47,470 --> 02:26:48,303
okay,

5869
02:26:49,070 --> 02:26:49,900
I mean man,

5870
02:26:49,900 --> 02:26:50,291
where are we?

5871
02:26:50,291 --> 02:26:50,750
Begin?

5872
02:26:50,750 --> 02:26:51,250
You want to go?

5873
02:26:51,250 --> 02:26:51,581
Yes,

5874
02:26:51,581 --> 02:26:52,280
that's what I'm telling you.

5875
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:52,871
Next question.

5876
02:26:52,871 --> 02:26:53,800
It's like when you're saying,

5877
02:26:53,890 --> 02:26:55,450
I could never make a cell phone.

5878
02:26:55,450 --> 02:26:57,760
I don't know what's in the
cell phone show you do.

5879
02:26:57,790 --> 02:26:59,160
You just got to do the work.

5880
02:26:59,210 --> 02:26:59,410
Yeah,

5881
02:26:59,410 --> 02:26:59,951
but that's what I'm saying.

5882
02:26:59,951 --> 02:27:00,830
Like I couldn't,

5883
02:27:00,850 --> 02:27:01,180
if,

5884
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:05,200
if somebody brought me all the parts
and said put it together and I don't,

5885
02:27:05,260 --> 02:27:06,860
I don't need to know how
to do it to believe that,

5886
02:27:07,060 --> 02:27:07,930
that it's doing the job.

5887
02:27:07,931 --> 02:27:11,170
But some people need to act like they
need to know how thing works for it to

5888
02:27:11,171 --> 02:27:11,740
make sense.

5889
02:27:11,740 --> 02:27:12,071
They need,

5890
02:27:12,071 --> 02:27:12,940
it needs to make sense to them.

5891
02:27:12,941 --> 02:27:13,061
Like,

5892
02:27:13,061 --> 02:27:13,840
no,

5893
02:27:13,840 --> 02:27:14,740
you didn't study that.

5894
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:15,500
Yeah.

5895
02:27:15,500 --> 02:27:19,570
You don't know that what you're telling
me a single celled organism can become a

5896
02:27:19,571 --> 02:27:20,230
giraffe.

5897
02:27:20,230 --> 02:27:20,531
Yes,

5898
02:27:20,531 --> 02:27:20,861
I am.

5899
02:27:20,861 --> 02:27:21,694
Next question.

5900
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:22,990
Yeah.

5901
02:27:22,990 --> 02:27:24,420
It takes millions of years fucker.

5902
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:25,480
Or don't worry about it.

5903
02:27:25,481 --> 02:27:26,314
Let the people who were,

5904
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:27,270
who went to college,

5905
02:27:27,270 --> 02:27:30,310
and I trust them because
they're all liberals,

5906
02:27:31,270 --> 02:27:33,070
liberals in the queer lover,

5907
02:27:33,071 --> 02:27:34,690
and those liberals
brought you your iPhone.

5908
02:27:34,690 --> 02:27:35,590
You're not worried about that.

5909
02:27:35,591 --> 02:27:36,580
So it just is true.

5910
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:37,473
That's the problem.

5911
02:27:37,690 --> 02:27:40,870
It's not a lot of conservative think tanks
creating the most innovative new cell

5912
02:27:40,871 --> 02:27:41,704
phones.

5913
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:42,130
No,

5914
02:27:42,130 --> 02:27:42,311
no,

5915
02:27:42,311 --> 02:27:43,144
no.

5916
02:27:43,270 --> 02:27:44,061
That's a weird thing.

5917
02:27:44,061 --> 02:27:44,290
And they'll,

5918
02:27:44,290 --> 02:27:48,190
a comforting thing that I like about a
lot of these internet based tech based

5919
02:27:48,191 --> 02:27:48,970
businesses,

5920
02:27:48,970 --> 02:27:50,890
they seem to be very ethical and moral.

5921
02:27:51,130 --> 02:27:53,170
Like they seem to have
a connect like Google,

5922
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:56,350
especially Google and a lot
of these companies they,

5923
02:27:56,351 --> 02:27:56,800
they're,

5924
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:01,800
they're way more open and way more
intelligent about their approach to ethics

5925
02:28:02,441 --> 02:28:03,130
and morals.

5926
02:28:03,130 --> 02:28:05,140
Then a lot of like other corporations.

5927
02:28:05,650 --> 02:28:06,011
Yeah.

5928
02:28:06,011 --> 02:28:07,600
But I think it's probably like if,

5929
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:08,020
if,

5930
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:08,351
if,

5931
02:28:08,351 --> 02:28:09,070
uh,

5932
02:28:09,070 --> 02:28:09,431
you know,

5933
02:28:09,431 --> 02:28:11,500
I don't know if Walmart is
way over here is not ethical,

5934
02:28:11,501 --> 02:28:12,190
moral,

5935
02:28:12,190 --> 02:28:12,521
moral.

5936
02:28:12,521 --> 02:28:14,170
Some people would say
that Facebook is here.

5937
02:28:14,710 --> 02:28:17,000
They wouldn't say it's like all
the way up to the other Facebook.

5938
02:28:17,020 --> 02:28:17,853
It's tricky.

5939
02:28:18,090 --> 02:28:18,340
Yeah.

5940
02:28:18,340 --> 02:28:18,730
Facebook.

5941
02:28:18,730 --> 02:28:18,851
Yeah.

5942
02:28:18,851 --> 02:28:19,660
I think that like,

5943
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:19,871
you know,

5944
02:28:19,871 --> 02:28:20,230
they own,

5945
02:28:20,230 --> 02:28:21,620
they own all their information.

5946
02:28:21,621 --> 02:28:24,830
They have like they sell it to
and they sell it and they make,

5947
02:28:24,870 --> 02:28:25,460
you're like,

5948
02:28:25,460 --> 02:28:27,590
how does this make money
if I'm not paying for it?

5949
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:31,090
How's the weird thing when you go to
Google search something and it shows you

5950
02:28:31,110 --> 02:28:34,100
like all sorts of other shit that you
might be interested in on the right hand

5951
02:28:34,101 --> 02:28:34,401
side.

5952
02:28:34,401 --> 02:28:34,701
And you're like,

5953
02:28:34,701 --> 02:28:35,330
wait a minute,

5954
02:28:35,330 --> 02:28:39,050
how the fuck do you know what I like or
the new thing where they show like I go,

5955
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:41,060
I looked up a heavy,

5956
02:28:41,061 --> 02:28:42,080
like a punching bag.

5957
02:28:42,110 --> 02:28:43,160
Like I was thinking of buying a,

5958
02:28:43,161 --> 02:28:43,401
I was like,

5959
02:28:43,401 --> 02:28:43,521
oh,

5960
02:28:43,521 --> 02:28:44,354
maybe we'll buy about punching back.

5961
02:28:44,510 --> 02:28:47,360
And now every time I go to websites
and being advertised for Everlast bags,

5962
02:28:47,361 --> 02:28:47,670
I'm like,

5963
02:28:47,670 --> 02:28:50,870
that one time I did a half hour
looking at punching bags went,

5964
02:28:50,871 --> 02:28:51,081
Nah,

5965
02:28:51,081 --> 02:28:51,530
it's dumb.

5966
02:28:51,530 --> 02:28:52,310
I'm not going to do that.

5967
02:28:52,310 --> 02:28:54,440
Can you just dump your cookies
or something like that and that,

5968
02:28:54,441 --> 02:28:54,800
uh,

5969
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:55,491
I guess you could,

5970
02:28:55,491 --> 02:28:57,350
but it's just that thing that I
don't think about until I'm like,

5971
02:28:57,351 --> 02:28:59,000
why is it telling me that or,

5972
02:28:59,001 --> 02:28:59,181
yeah.

5973
02:28:59,181 --> 02:29:01,880
Why is it telling me about like
I've made a reservation at a,

5974
02:29:01,890 --> 02:29:02,810
this happened this week.

5975
02:29:02,811 --> 02:29:05,210
I made a reservation at this
hotel I'm staying at now.

5976
02:29:05,211 --> 02:29:07,760
My computer's advertising me to
stay at the hotel I'm staying at.

5977
02:29:09,350 --> 02:29:10,183
I did it.

5978
02:29:10,550 --> 02:29:11,383
You already got me.

5979
02:29:11,390 --> 02:29:12,350
They already got my money.

5980
02:29:12,380 --> 02:29:12,590
No,

5981
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:13,011
I'm not going to,

5982
02:29:13,011 --> 02:29:13,940
I'm already staying there.

5983
02:29:14,180 --> 02:29:14,361
Well,

5984
02:29:14,361 --> 02:29:17,690
it gets even weirder when
you have a Google phone
because when you have a Google

5985
02:29:17,691 --> 02:29:18,200
phone,

5986
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:21,500
it'll tell you like you look something
up and I'll show you like how many

5987
02:29:21,501 --> 02:29:22,790
minutes that is from your home.

5988
02:29:23,450 --> 02:29:24,260
Do you know where I live?

5989
02:29:24,260 --> 02:29:24,920
Yeah,

5990
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:25,190
yeah.

5991
02:29:25,190 --> 02:29:25,401
No,

5992
02:29:25,401 --> 02:29:25,611
it's,

5993
02:29:25,611 --> 02:29:27,140
it knows where you go every night.

5994
02:29:27,141 --> 02:29:28,970
So it's soon as soon as that's your home,

5995
02:29:29,150 --> 02:29:31,610
so it tracks that down
and then where you are,

5996
02:29:31,611 --> 02:29:32,840
you're 23 minutes from your home.

5997
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:33,471
Fuck.

5998
02:29:33,471 --> 02:29:34,610
Do you know where I live?

5999
02:29:34,660 --> 02:29:36,200
You should leave for work now.

6000
02:29:37,910 --> 02:29:38,743
What are you telling me?

6001
02:29:38,810 --> 02:29:40,520
Or the thing that I find
with my Google phone,

6002
02:29:40,521 --> 02:29:44,690
the technology is still not working the
way I will Google something like in La,

6003
02:29:44,900 --> 02:29:45,140
like,

6004
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:45,291
oh,

6005
02:29:45,291 --> 02:29:45,861
where's that thing?

6006
02:29:45,861 --> 02:29:46,910
Just something that's not even,

6007
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:47,420
it's just like,

6008
02:29:47,420 --> 02:29:47,541
oh,

6009
02:29:47,541 --> 02:29:48,081
where's that thing?

6010
02:29:48,081 --> 02:29:48,940
Cause I'm curious if were to,

6011
02:29:49,070 --> 02:29:49,310
okay,

6012
02:29:49,310 --> 02:29:49,820
there's,

6013
02:29:49,820 --> 02:29:51,890
if then I was in San Diego a
couple days ago and it was like,

6014
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:53,390
it's four hours to that location.

6015
02:29:53,391 --> 02:29:54,560
You googled in Los Angeles.

6016
02:29:54,561 --> 02:29:57,280
Like why would I need to
know that now I'm not,

6017
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:58,340
I'm not going there.

6018
02:29:58,341 --> 02:30:00,950
You're just telling me four hours.

6019
02:30:01,480 --> 02:30:03,920
They'd slowly starting to get smart.

6020
02:30:04,150 --> 02:30:05,000
It's not quite,

6021
02:30:05,001 --> 02:30:05,900
it's not quite there,

6022
02:30:06,680 --> 02:30:08,170
but if it does get too smart you,

6023
02:30:08,180 --> 02:30:12,170
it's going to be so intrusive
or or I have to say convenient.

6024
02:30:12,620 --> 02:30:13,310
I mean that's,

6025
02:30:13,310 --> 02:30:13,870
I mean you,

6026
02:30:13,870 --> 02:30:14,930
you saw the movie her?

6027
02:30:15,410 --> 02:30:15,910
No,

6028
02:30:15,910 --> 02:30:16,530
uh,

6029
02:30:16,530 --> 02:30:16,800
it's a,

6030
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:17,250
it's a good,

6031
02:30:17,250 --> 02:30:17,781
I think it's a good,

6032
02:30:17,781 --> 02:30:18,351
it's a good flick.

6033
02:30:18,351 --> 02:30:18,951
You know what it is.

6034
02:30:18,951 --> 02:30:19,301
It's the,

6035
02:30:19,301 --> 02:30:19,920
yeah,

6036
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:20,753
it,

6037
02:30:20,990 --> 02:30:22,070
we want that,

6038
02:30:22,600 --> 02:30:24,290
but maybe not the sex boils.

6039
02:30:24,291 --> 02:30:25,610
Actually someone was
want the sex part of it,

6040
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:28,670
but we want to be able to walk
into our home and go pull up,

6041
02:30:28,671 --> 02:30:30,140
my email is put up,

6042
02:30:30,141 --> 02:30:31,570
pull up my Netflix queue and Dah,

6043
02:30:31,571 --> 02:30:31,731
Dah,

6044
02:30:31,731 --> 02:30:31,970
Dah,

6045
02:30:31,970 --> 02:30:32,601
Dah and then,

6046
02:30:32,601 --> 02:30:33,170
and then,

6047
02:30:33,170 --> 02:30:34,220
and you want to go to work and be like,

6048
02:30:34,221 --> 02:30:35,360
send me that that you want.

6049
02:30:35,361 --> 02:30:36,141
We want that.

6050
02:30:36,141 --> 02:30:37,220
That's what this is all about.

6051
02:30:37,490 --> 02:30:38,610
That in a lot of ways.

6052
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:40,550
In some ways you're saying we're getting,

6053
02:30:40,551 --> 02:30:40,730
yeah,

6054
02:30:40,730 --> 02:30:41,960
people say we're giving up privacy,

6055
02:30:41,961 --> 02:30:42,650
but people are like,

6056
02:30:42,650 --> 02:30:46,310
people are willing to give up privacy if
it comes with a coupon and a f in some

6057
02:30:46,311 --> 02:30:46,910
free stuff.

6058
02:30:46,910 --> 02:30:47,431
You know what I mean?

6059
02:30:47,431 --> 02:30:50,240
Until it bites him in the ass
until it bites him in the ass.

6060
02:30:50,241 --> 02:30:50,931
And that's the question.

6061
02:30:50,931 --> 02:30:53,120
We all have a different place
where we were our asses,

6062
02:30:54,290 --> 02:30:56,510
we all have different size and
shaped acids and I was like,

6063
02:30:56,511 --> 02:30:57,500
it's not biting me in the ass shit.

6064
02:30:57,501 --> 02:30:58,010
And I'm like,

6065
02:30:58,010 --> 02:30:58,620
oh.

6066
02:30:58,620 --> 02:30:59,390
But yeah,

6067
02:30:59,390 --> 02:31:00,290
the thing with the NSA,

6068
02:31:00,291 --> 02:31:01,960
it's like we,

6069
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,210
it's hard to say they stay trolled all
our data when we're the ones who said

6070
02:31:05,211 --> 02:31:06,530
here he would you like our name?

6071
02:31:06,531 --> 02:31:07,790
Would you like to data true?

6072
02:31:07,910 --> 02:31:08,240
You know,

6073
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:11,810
you download candy crush to your phone
and you think I'm just playing a fun game

6074
02:31:11,811 --> 02:31:12,231
for free.

6075
02:31:12,231 --> 02:31:12,651
And it's like,

6076
02:31:12,651 --> 02:31:12,891
no,

6077
02:31:12,891 --> 02:31:14,120
it's knows where you are now.

6078
02:31:14,150 --> 02:31:18,080
But the real problem is that I let you
know that the government was able to read

6079
02:31:18,081 --> 02:31:20,250
your emails anytime want these workers

6080
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:22,470
could just like download your Dick Pics.

6081
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:23,730
This is fun to send them off.

6082
02:31:24,930 --> 02:31:26,760
And Edward Snowden is telling the truth.

6083
02:31:26,761 --> 02:31:27,780
I mean obviously I don't know,

6084
02:31:27,781 --> 02:31:31,560
but he said that there's people in his
office that were downloading emails from

6085
02:31:31,561 --> 02:31:34,560
ex girlfriends and shit and
sharing photos and stuff.

6086
02:31:35,130 --> 02:31:36,540
I feel like you say like,

6087
02:31:36,541 --> 02:31:37,351
people didn't know that.

6088
02:31:37,351 --> 02:31:40,830
And I feel like every black barbershop
around the country has been talking about

6089
02:31:40,831 --> 02:31:41,581
that shit for years.

6090
02:31:41,581 --> 02:31:42,930
Black people have always
been like the CIA,

6091
02:31:42,940 --> 02:31:43,131
you know,

6092
02:31:43,131 --> 02:31:44,250
the ca and Vinod crack,

6093
02:31:44,251 --> 02:31:44,671
you know what I mean?

6094
02:31:44,671 --> 02:31:48,300
Like that level of like we're being
watched at all times because every time I

6095
02:31:48,301 --> 02:31:50,640
walk into a store there
literally is a guy watching me.

6096
02:31:50,641 --> 02:31:51,181
You know what I mean?

6097
02:31:51,181 --> 02:31:52,350
So I think in the black community,

6098
02:31:52,351 --> 02:31:54,780
I don't think the NSA story
was as big of a Oh yeah,

6099
02:31:54,781 --> 02:31:55,660
the government's watching us.

6100
02:31:55,660 --> 02:31:55,830
Yeah.

6101
02:31:55,830 --> 02:31:58,350
The black community and the truth
or community should get together.

6102
02:31:58,570 --> 02:32:01,590
That never seems to work out
because the truth of committee goes,

6103
02:32:01,591 --> 02:32:02,550
there was no slavery.

6104
02:32:02,551 --> 02:32:03,110
Okay.

6105
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:03,960
All right guys.

6106
02:32:03,990 --> 02:32:05,790
I had a CIA guy in here,

6107
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:06,840
former CIA,

6108
02:32:07,260 --> 02:32:08,430
director of operations,

6109
02:32:08,431 --> 02:32:08,881
whatever the fuck.

6110
02:32:08,881 --> 02:32:09,870
He was really nice guy.

6111
02:32:09,871 --> 02:32:11,070
But I played him,

6112
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:14,460
this Guy Michael Rupert talking about
how they were selling drugs and he was a

6113
02:32:14,461 --> 02:32:17,040
former La narcotics officer who,

6114
02:32:17,041 --> 02:32:17,874
uh,

6115
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:23,080
like literally caught the CIA selling
drugs in black communities and was direct.

6116
02:32:23,431 --> 02:32:26,400
It was addressing the director
of the CIA at the time.

6117
02:32:26,401 --> 02:32:30,330
He got fired right after this and I
played it for him on the podcast and just

6118
02:32:30,331 --> 02:32:31,290
watching them try to

6119
02:32:33,570 --> 02:32:34,500
dance around it.

6120
02:32:36,020 --> 02:32:36,430
Yeah.

6121
02:32:36,430 --> 02:32:37,263
No,

6122
02:32:37,380 --> 02:32:38,040
we didn't even,

6123
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:39,790
I mean I let it go after awhile,

6124
02:32:39,870 --> 02:32:44,870
but I didn't even get into like Gary
Webb or any of the cocaine plane that had

6125
02:32:44,941 --> 02:32:46,620
been to Guantanamo Bay twice.

6126
02:32:46,620 --> 02:32:49,680
It crashed with tons of cocaine in it.

6127
02:32:50,220 --> 02:32:51,053
In Mexico.

6128
02:32:51,080 --> 02:32:51,200
Yeah.

6129
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:55,020
Mean there's a lot of evidence that the
CIA might've been involved in some form

6130
02:32:55,021 --> 02:32:56,520
or someone in the CIA.

6131
02:32:56,820 --> 02:32:57,210
I mean,

6132
02:32:57,210 --> 02:32:57,751
absolutely.

6133
02:32:57,751 --> 02:32:57,961
I mean,

6134
02:32:57,961 --> 02:32:58,750
you know,

6135
02:32:58,750 --> 02:32:59,130
yeah.

6136
02:32:59,130 --> 02:32:59,963
I mean that's the,

6137
02:33:00,210 --> 02:33:01,043
you can't,

6138
02:33:01,310 --> 02:33:01,780
you know,

6139
02:33:01,780 --> 02:33:04,710
the black people can't
flood the ghetto with drugs.

6140
02:33:05,420 --> 02:33:05,950
Yeah.

6141
02:33:05,950 --> 02:33:06,331
You can't,

6142
02:33:06,331 --> 02:33:06,740
you know,

6143
02:33:06,740 --> 02:33:07,440
I mean,

6144
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:08,550
every now and again there's a,

6145
02:33:08,790 --> 02:33:09,870
Rick freeway were awesome,

6146
02:33:09,950 --> 02:33:10,511
but there's not,

6147
02:33:10,511 --> 02:33:10,780
that's,

6148
02:33:10,780 --> 02:33:12,390
that was the guy that
I had on the podcast,

6149
02:33:12,550 --> 02:33:12,991
a freeway,

6150
02:33:12,991 --> 02:33:14,070
Ricky on it three times.

6151
02:33:14,370 --> 02:33:18,270
And one of the Times that I had him
on was he discussed how he got into a

6152
02:33:18,271 --> 02:33:21,600
connection with this guy who was directly
sending the profits to the fucking

6153
02:33:21,601 --> 02:33:22,434
contrast.

6154
02:33:22,450 --> 02:33:23,130
I mean the,

6155
02:33:23,130 --> 02:33:26,370
the whole contras and
Sandinistas thing in Nicaragua,

6156
02:33:26,580 --> 02:33:30,360
which was the Oliver North scandal
that was on television was all at our

6157
02:33:30,361 --> 02:33:30,810
freeway.

6158
02:33:30,810 --> 02:33:35,490
Ricky selling coke and it's incredible
and yet you feel like a little bit,

6159
02:33:35,491 --> 02:33:38,440
I feel like at least at least the
black guy made some money off of that.

6160
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:39,421
I mean,

6161
02:33:39,421 --> 02:33:39,631
yeah,

6162
02:33:39,631 --> 02:33:40,590
not certainly he,

6163
02:33:40,591 --> 02:33:41,790
I don't know if he would do it all again.

6164
02:33:42,060 --> 02:33:42,893
He wouldn't.

6165
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:43,920
He definitely wouldn't.

6166
02:33:43,921 --> 02:33:45,390
He's an interesting guy.

6167
02:33:45,450 --> 02:33:46,120
He's a,

6168
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:47,340
he's learned a lot from it.

6169
02:33:47,370 --> 02:33:50,840
I mean he taught himself how to read in
jail once he was arrested for that and

6170
02:33:50,841 --> 02:33:55,590
then found a loophole in the argument
that got him arrested for three strikes

6171
02:33:55,770 --> 02:33:59,100
because it's supposed to be three
different charges and he got two kids.

6172
02:33:59,101 --> 02:34:03,540
Two different charges was one was one
time he was arrested and that doesn't

6173
02:34:03,541 --> 02:34:05,220
count as the three strikes law.

6174
02:34:05,221 --> 02:34:06,300
So they had to let him out.

6175
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:08,100
He was going to be in jail
for the rest of his life.

6176
02:34:08,101 --> 02:34:12,090
He figured that out on his own after
he learned how to read in jail.

6177
02:34:12,140 --> 02:34:12,973
Yeah,

6178
02:34:13,170 --> 02:34:13,801
I believe it.

6179
02:34:13,801 --> 02:34:14,130
I know.

6180
02:34:14,130 --> 02:34:14,731
And it's funny,

6181
02:34:14,731 --> 02:34:17,290
I met him at a party one time
and it was when I had the show.

6182
02:34:17,291 --> 02:34:18,160
And so when I had the show,

6183
02:34:18,161 --> 02:34:20,860
I would get like a tension for people
who normally wouldn't talk to me.

6184
02:34:20,861 --> 02:34:21,071
You know,

6185
02:34:21,071 --> 02:34:21,640
like it's,

6186
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:22,330
I met him at a party,

6187
02:34:22,330 --> 02:34:22,961
he was very nice,

6188
02:34:22,961 --> 02:34:23,560
but he's like,

6189
02:34:23,560 --> 02:34:23,831
he's like,

6190
02:34:23,831 --> 02:34:24,101
hey man,

6191
02:34:24,101 --> 02:34:24,790
give me your number.

6192
02:34:24,790 --> 02:34:25,720
And I just had this weird like,

6193
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:27,033
okay,

6194
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:30,170
like,

6195
02:34:30,370 --> 02:34:30,900
I don't know,

6196
02:34:30,900 --> 02:34:31,661
Mr. Awesome.

6197
02:34:31,661 --> 02:34:34,000
I want you to get it to you,

6198
02:34:34,060 --> 02:34:34,893
sir.

6199
02:34:35,350 --> 02:34:37,990
Did you see a Jim Norton's vice
show where he interviewed them?

6200
02:34:38,030 --> 02:34:38,110
Oh,

6201
02:34:38,110 --> 02:34:38,890
I haven't seen it yet.

6202
02:34:38,890 --> 02:34:39,370
Pretty good.

6203
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:39,750
Yeah,

6204
02:34:39,750 --> 02:34:40,280
we are very,

6205
02:34:40,280 --> 02:34:41,021
very interesting.

6206
02:34:41,021 --> 02:34:41,890
He's an interesting guy,

6207
02:34:41,891 --> 02:34:42,221
man.

6208
02:34:42,221 --> 02:34:42,761
And you know,

6209
02:34:42,761 --> 02:34:43,541
he's a real deal.

6210
02:34:43,541 --> 02:34:43,751
I mean,

6211
02:34:43,751 --> 02:34:46,540
he really did have a multi,

6212
02:34:46,541 --> 02:34:47,171
multi,

6213
02:34:47,171 --> 02:34:52,171
multimillion dollar cocaine industry and
it was really going to the government.

6214
02:34:52,300 --> 02:34:52,660
Yes.

6215
02:34:52,660 --> 02:34:52,991
I mean,

6216
02:34:52,991 --> 02:34:53,800
that's a fact.

6217
02:34:53,800 --> 02:34:54,011
Yeah.

6218
02:34:54,011 --> 02:34:54,370
No,

6219
02:34:54,370 --> 02:34:55,001
and I feel like,

6220
02:34:55,001 --> 02:34:55,271
again,

6221
02:34:55,271 --> 02:34:57,970
it's a person who sent in a lot of
black barbershops in the basement of

6222
02:34:57,971 --> 02:34:58,321
churches.

6223
02:34:58,321 --> 02:34:58,511
I'm like,

6224
02:34:58,511 --> 02:34:58,661
yeah,

6225
02:34:58,661 --> 02:34:59,494
you don't get to tell me.

6226
02:34:59,910 --> 02:35:00,580
Okay.

6227
02:35:00,580 --> 02:35:01,120
I,

6228
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:01,960
I don't think,

6229
02:35:02,260 --> 02:35:04,030
I don't believe in a lot
of conspiracy theories,

6230
02:35:04,031 --> 02:35:04,601
but that to me,

6231
02:35:04,601 --> 02:35:06,070
that doesn't feel like
a conspiracy theory.

6232
02:35:06,130 --> 02:35:06,611
That feels like,

6233
02:35:06,611 --> 02:35:06,701
well,

6234
02:35:06,701 --> 02:35:07,091
of course.

6235
02:35:07,091 --> 02:35:10,600
How else would you get cocaine and
crack in the ghetto unless somebody was

6236
02:35:10,601 --> 02:35:13,360
greasing the palms to make that happen
and that person worked in the government.

6237
02:35:13,361 --> 02:35:14,080
That was the government.

6238
02:35:14,080 --> 02:35:14,381
Well,

6239
02:35:14,381 --> 02:35:15,011
not only that,

6240
02:35:15,011 --> 02:35:18,160
if I was sitting around the government
and I was sitting around with a bunch of

6241
02:35:18,910 --> 02:35:21,340
military industrial complex
leaders and everyone's,

6242
02:35:21,850 --> 02:35:22,061
you know,

6243
02:35:22,061 --> 02:35:23,470
going over how to make money,

6244
02:35:23,471 --> 02:35:24,010
you go,

6245
02:35:24,010 --> 02:35:24,730
um,

6246
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:25,331
you guys were,

6247
02:35:25,331 --> 02:35:27,130
how much coke is getting
sold in this country?

6248
02:35:27,190 --> 02:35:27,430
Yeah.

6249
02:35:27,430 --> 02:35:28,060
It's a lot of code.

6250
02:35:28,060 --> 02:35:29,170
We're not going to stop that.

6251
02:35:29,230 --> 02:35:29,531
Okay.

6252
02:35:29,531 --> 02:35:30,364
They're going to always,

6253
02:35:30,370 --> 02:35:31,810
so who's going to make this money?

6254
02:35:31,811 --> 02:35:32,644
Do we want the,

6255
02:35:32,870 --> 02:35:35,680
the fucking Colombians to make them
money or should we just make the money?

6256
02:35:36,220 --> 02:35:37,053
Yeah,

6257
02:35:37,150 --> 02:35:37,910
we should probably make the money.

6258
02:35:37,910 --> 02:35:38,090
Yeah.

6259
02:35:38,090 --> 02:35:38,920
We're not going to,

6260
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:39,290
yeah,

6261
02:35:39,290 --> 02:35:40,420
I'm not going to stop coke,

6262
02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:41,553
but I feel like,

6263
02:35:41,740 --> 02:35:42,790
I don't know if they even have the,

6264
02:35:42,791 --> 02:35:44,440
we're not going to stop at
Congress and he'd be like,

6265
02:35:44,470 --> 02:35:45,850
I feel like it's like a new stock thing.

6266
02:35:46,030 --> 02:35:46,181
Hey,

6267
02:35:46,181 --> 02:35:46,961
coke's making along the way.

6268
02:35:46,961 --> 02:35:47,771
Listen to this than that.

6269
02:35:47,771 --> 02:35:48,910
I don't feel like it gets to the,

6270
02:35:49,210 --> 02:35:49,421
hey,

6271
02:35:49,421 --> 02:35:50,950
we can't stop the people from,

6272
02:35:51,010 --> 02:35:51,411
you know,

6273
02:35:51,411 --> 02:35:51,520
it.

6274
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:54,220
I don't think it's that
godfather discussion where
like they're animals anyway,

6275
02:35:54,221 --> 02:35:55,740
let them destroy themselves and it's like,

6276
02:35:55,960 --> 02:35:56,081
oh,

6277
02:35:56,081 --> 02:35:56,891
that's making a lot of money.

6278
02:35:56,891 --> 02:35:57,880
It's like some lose this.

6279
02:35:57,880 --> 02:35:58,880
So it's a,

6280
02:35:58,890 --> 02:35:59,290
yeah,

6281
02:35:59,290 --> 02:36:00,310
it's apples making money.

6282
02:36:00,311 --> 02:36:01,061
We should invest in that.

6283
02:36:01,061 --> 02:36:02,620
And cocaine in the ghettos making money.

6284
02:36:02,630 --> 02:36:02,840
Yeah.

6285
02:36:02,840 --> 02:36:04,840
Actually that the big impediment,

6286
02:36:04,870 --> 02:36:06,850
like what's the big
problem as law enforcement?

6287
02:36:07,060 --> 02:36:07,540
Uh,

6288
02:36:07,540 --> 02:36:10,620
that we got that we got that
you're going to be fine.

6289
02:36:11,170 --> 02:36:11,500
We had,

6290
02:36:11,500 --> 02:36:12,140
we already have that.

6291
02:36:12,140 --> 02:36:12,930
We already have that in,

6292
02:36:12,930 --> 02:36:13,751
well that's from Michael.

6293
02:36:13,751 --> 02:36:17,500
Rupert stepped up because he was
a former La narcotics officer.

6294
02:36:17,530 --> 02:36:22,530
He was a guy who was involved in busting
cases and he told his story in no

6295
02:36:23,591 --> 02:36:28,591
uncertain terms how he was told to let
the case go because it involved the CIA

6296
02:36:29,380 --> 02:36:29,741
and he's like,

6297
02:36:29,741 --> 02:36:30,820
what are you fucking saying?

6298
02:36:30,821 --> 02:36:34,960
Are you telling me that the CIA is
selling drugs in the black community?

6299
02:36:35,260 --> 02:36:35,561
No.

6300
02:36:35,561 --> 02:36:36,394
I'm telling you,

6301
02:36:36,430 --> 02:36:37,600
let this case go.

6302
02:36:38,230 --> 02:36:41,380
This case that you busted
people is actually the CIA.

6303
02:36:42,060 --> 02:36:42,760
Are you saying?

6304
02:36:42,760 --> 02:36:43,210
Yes.

6305
02:36:43,210 --> 02:36:43,540
Yes.

6306
02:36:43,540 --> 02:36:45,550
And that's why you have the police.

6307
02:36:45,551 --> 02:36:48,880
That's why the black community has a
problem with police in this country.

6308
02:36:48,970 --> 02:36:49,803
One reason.

6309
02:36:49,960 --> 02:36:50,220
One of,

6310
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:50,341
yeah,

6311
02:36:50,341 --> 02:36:50,980
it's hard to,

6312
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:52,690
it's hard to believe that
that's the voice of authority.

6313
02:36:52,691 --> 02:36:55,930
If you feel like the voice of authority
is not honoring its own authority.

6314
02:36:56,410 --> 02:36:57,250
You know it's interesting to,

6315
02:36:57,251 --> 02:37:00,010
Bay area is also interesting
because of a Oakland,

6316
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:03,100
which the the police are
notoriously horrible.

6317
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:03,993
Yes.

6318
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:05,440
Like that extra horrible.

6319
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:05,741
Yeah.

6320
02:37:05,741 --> 02:37:06,574
Why is that?

6321
02:37:07,860 --> 02:37:09,520
I mean because Oakland's crazy cause it's,

6322
02:37:10,230 --> 02:37:11,063
cause the Oakland,

6323
02:37:11,470 --> 02:37:12,910
Oakland now is becoming gentrified.

6324
02:37:12,911 --> 02:37:15,770
So Oakland is not one of the cities that
you find in America's top places for

6325
02:37:15,771 --> 02:37:16,160
people

6326
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:17,460
to live white paper.

6327
02:37:17,730 --> 02:37:18,700
So that's why people,

6328
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:20,150
cause it's becoming gentrified.

6329
02:37:20,151 --> 02:37:21,140
So Oakland is really strong,

6330
02:37:21,750 --> 02:37:24,770
is really struggling with the fact that
it's being gentrified very quickly.

6331
02:37:25,080 --> 02:37:25,730
Uh,

6332
02:37:25,730 --> 02:37:29,600
but it's just communities that
are not even majority black.

6333
02:37:29,601 --> 02:37:31,340
Cause as much as people
think Oakland's a black city,

6334
02:37:31,341 --> 02:37:32,690
it's like 30% black.

6335
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:33,500
It's not,

6336
02:37:33,500 --> 02:37:33,771
you know,

6337
02:37:33,771 --> 02:37:34,281
people go,

6338
02:37:34,281 --> 02:37:35,480
it's funny how few black people,

6339
02:37:35,481 --> 02:37:36,320
we have to have people go,

6340
02:37:36,321 --> 02:37:37,400
there's a lot of black people in here,

6341
02:37:37,460 --> 02:37:39,560
30% more than the national average.

6342
02:37:39,710 --> 02:37:40,540
It is more than that,

6343
02:37:40,540 --> 02:37:42,920
but it ain't 70% what makes,

6344
02:37:43,100 --> 02:37:44,210
what's the national average?

6345
02:37:44,380 --> 02:37:48,950
It's like a 11 I think it's like somewhere
around 12 or 11 one if you have 11

6346
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:49,880
that's a black neighborhood.

6347
02:37:50,630 --> 02:37:51,111
Exactly.

6348
02:37:51,111 --> 02:37:52,480
What 11% blind people.

6349
02:37:53,320 --> 02:37:53,841
Exactly.

6350
02:37:53,841 --> 02:37:54,210
Yeah.

6351
02:37:54,210 --> 02:37:56,990
Most neighborhoods are 100% white.

6352
02:37:57,010 --> 02:37:57,550
Yeah.

6353
02:37:57,550 --> 02:37:58,340
And it's a weird,

6354
02:37:58,340 --> 02:37:59,540
and if a black family moves in,

6355
02:37:59,541 --> 02:38:00,410
it's like what's happening?

6356
02:38:00,740 --> 02:38:01,573
What's going on over there?

6357
02:38:01,580 --> 02:38:02,510
What's going on over here?

6358
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:06,220
So let Oakland like a lot of cities that
are thought of to be black cities are

6359
02:38:06,221 --> 02:38:07,970
over policed and underserved,

6360
02:38:07,971 --> 02:38:08,271
you know,

6361
02:38:08,271 --> 02:38:10,610
cause people that to me
it's like it's just an,

6362
02:38:10,820 --> 02:38:14,580
it's a structural institutional
racism problem that the,

6363
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:15,321
for example,

6364
02:38:15,321 --> 02:38:17,030
and we can talk about
it or not talk about it,

6365
02:38:17,031 --> 02:38:22,031
but so that if a guy walks down the
middle of the street saying like,

6366
02:38:22,280 --> 02:38:25,160
like sort of being a teenager who's
allowed guy walking down the street,

6367
02:38:25,670 --> 02:38:27,070
a white teenager might get told,

6368
02:38:27,080 --> 02:38:28,830
get the fuck out of the
street and the guy who,

6369
02:38:28,850 --> 02:38:31,160
I'm not getting a street dude
grab and put them on the corner,

6370
02:38:31,161 --> 02:38:32,060
don't do this shit again.

6371
02:38:32,090 --> 02:38:33,550
But a black teenager who
walks down the middle,

6372
02:38:33,560 --> 02:38:34,041
the street and goes,

6373
02:38:34,041 --> 02:38:35,330
I'm not getting on the
street ends up debt,

6374
02:38:36,320 --> 02:38:40,200
is my opinion on that situation that
we get that even with that things that

6375
02:38:40,201 --> 02:38:40,700
would be,

6376
02:38:40,700 --> 02:38:42,140
that would be sort of
like if you're white,

6377
02:38:42,141 --> 02:38:42,531
they would be like,

6378
02:38:42,531 --> 02:38:43,010
all right,

6379
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:43,460
let's see.

6380
02:38:43,460 --> 02:38:44,930
We're not going to make
a big deal out of this,

6381
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:45,860
that when you're black,

6382
02:38:45,860 --> 02:38:49,610
it can end up in your death because of
the approach to policing black people in

6383
02:38:49,611 --> 02:38:50,444
this country.

6384
02:38:50,660 --> 02:38:55,660
Do you think that that's a problem
inherent with police officers or is it

6385
02:38:56,151 --> 02:38:58,250
because they're dealing
with so much violence,

6386
02:38:58,251 --> 02:38:59,750
it's coming from black people?

6387
02:38:59,990 --> 02:39:03,980
Is it because there have been
told to handle cases differently?

6388
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:05,081
I think it's a,

6389
02:39:05,081 --> 02:39:05,631
I think it's,

6390
02:39:05,631 --> 02:39:07,760
the America was founded on racism,

6391
02:39:08,360 --> 02:39:09,230
so I think it's a,

6392
02:39:09,231 --> 02:39:09,711
it's a,

6393
02:39:09,711 --> 02:39:13,880
I'm not going to necessarily
say cops are the problem cops,

6394
02:39:13,910 --> 02:39:17,120
the way people were black people are
policing is a symptom of the fact that

6395
02:39:17,121 --> 02:39:17,531
American,

6396
02:39:17,531 --> 02:39:21,650
the cornerstone of America is racism
and everything we built was on that.

6397
02:39:21,950 --> 02:39:24,170
And that's why people want to have,

6398
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:25,790
when you won't have the
reparations discussion,

6399
02:39:25,791 --> 02:39:26,110
it's like,

6400
02:39:26,110 --> 02:39:26,211
well,

6401
02:39:26,211 --> 02:39:28,550
you know how we get a lot of
cheap labor in this country,

6402
02:39:28,551 --> 02:39:29,150
but you know,

6403
02:39:29,150 --> 02:39:31,100
how do we get to be the richest
country in the world for a while?

6404
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:33,530
Because we had a 40 year
headstart on the labor.

6405
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:34,131
You know what I mean?

6406
02:39:34,131 --> 02:39:34,851
Like we weren't paying,

6407
02:39:34,851 --> 02:39:35,211
they weren't,

6408
02:39:35,211 --> 02:39:36,740
people weren't being paid
to build this country.

6409
02:39:36,741 --> 02:39:37,574
So,

6410
02:39:37,610 --> 02:39:38,090
uh,

6411
02:39:38,090 --> 02:39:41,720
I think that when the cornerstone of
this country is founded on racism and the

6412
02:39:41,721 --> 02:39:45,770
people who police the country are trying
to protect the country's reputation and

6413
02:39:45,771 --> 02:39:47,450
name that means a lot of times they,

6414
02:39:47,570 --> 02:39:48,550
they use racism.

6415
02:39:48,680 --> 02:39:50,810
Racism is a part of how
they police the country.

6416
02:39:51,020 --> 02:39:51,351
How,

6417
02:39:51,351 --> 02:39:56,351
can you ever fix a scenario where the
entire culture was established with slave

6418
02:39:56,841 --> 02:39:57,560
labor?

6419
02:39:57,560 --> 02:40:01,220
If a giant percentage of
what made America what it is,

6420
02:40:01,250 --> 02:40:03,230
was established because of slave labor,

6421
02:40:03,380 --> 02:40:04,460
how does that get fixed?

6422
02:40:04,610 --> 02:40:06,800
Like how does that ever balance it out?

6423
02:40:07,160 --> 02:40:07,601
How does it,

6424
02:40:07,601 --> 02:40:10,890
it does it just come naturally over
a course of a long period of time?

6425
02:40:10,940 --> 02:40:12,850
Definitely doesn't come
think socially engineered.

6426
02:40:12,870 --> 02:40:13,190
It's,

6427
02:40:13,190 --> 02:40:13,940
it has to be a,

6428
02:40:13,940 --> 02:40:14,350
yeah.

6429
02:40:14,350 --> 02:40:14,750
Uh,

6430
02:40:14,750 --> 02:40:15,091
it has,

6431
02:40:15,091 --> 02:40:16,710
something has to jumpstart the process.

6432
02:40:16,711 --> 02:40:17,650
I think that the,

6433
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:18,753
the,

6434
02:40:18,770 --> 02:40:21,320
you can't say affirmative action in this
country without some people go over to

6435
02:40:21,340 --> 02:40:23,640
[inaudible] then a white
man won't have a job.

6436
02:40:23,641 --> 02:40:24,121
And it's like,

6437
02:40:24,121 --> 02:40:26,640
but actually it's like you
have to jumpstart the process.

6438
02:40:26,641 --> 02:40:30,860
You have to and maybe it's for me it's
like if I literally said that I said this

6439
02:40:30,880 --> 02:40:33,300
really if every black man in
this country was given therapy,

6440
02:40:33,301 --> 02:40:36,480
cause I feel like being black in America
you have a mild form of PTSD or severe

6441
02:40:36,481 --> 02:40:41,481
form of Ptsd depending upon where you
live and if you made it and you guarantee

6442
02:40:42,151 --> 02:40:47,151
that the schools in the inner city we're
good that they were well funded public

6443
02:40:47,911 --> 02:40:50,070
schools where you could
get where you could pay.

6444
02:40:50,340 --> 02:40:53,730
You may not get a good education here
but this is a place where good education

6445
02:40:53,731 --> 02:40:54,690
happens easily.

6446
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:56,760
And that's not true of most
schools in the inner city.

6447
02:40:57,030 --> 02:40:58,050
And if you said,

6448
02:40:58,080 --> 02:41:02,370
and if you made it friendly for major
grocery stores to be in the inner city so

6449
02:41:02,371 --> 02:41:04,170
that you know you've been
in a poor neighborhood,

6450
02:41:04,171 --> 02:41:05,400
like that's the grocery store,

6451
02:41:05,940 --> 02:41:08,160
you know where it's not a
major chain grocery store,

6452
02:41:08,161 --> 02:41:10,140
it's a 99 cent store that also has fruit.

6453
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:10,980
You know what I mean?

6454
02:41:10,980 --> 02:41:12,090
It's like that you,

6455
02:41:12,260 --> 02:41:15,500
you said that if you made it so that it
was friendly for those companies coming

6456
02:41:15,510 --> 02:41:15,781
to move there.

6457
02:41:15,781 --> 02:41:17,280
Cause a lot of the gentrification happens.

6458
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:19,890
It's like people know their
neighborhoods are being gentrified.

6459
02:41:20,100 --> 02:41:23,100
When the nine 9 cent close door
closes down in a whole foods opens,

6460
02:41:23,101 --> 02:41:23,311
they're like,

6461
02:41:23,311 --> 02:41:24,370
oh finally we have,

6462
02:41:24,430 --> 02:41:25,560
we can't afford to shop there.

6463
02:41:26,070 --> 02:41:26,341
You know,

6464
02:41:26,341 --> 02:41:29,940
so you have to change the
structures of the neighborhoods.

6465
02:41:30,150 --> 02:41:33,180
You have to change the structures
of how people are being,

6466
02:41:33,210 --> 02:41:35,550
how people are living
their lives and there's no,

6467
02:41:35,610 --> 02:41:38,430
there's no motivation to do that.

6468
02:41:39,210 --> 02:41:39,571
No,

6469
02:41:39,571 --> 02:41:41,100
I think that the only,

6470
02:41:41,130 --> 02:41:41,963
the,

6471
02:41:41,970 --> 02:41:44,490
the only hope that we
have of that is that,

6472
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:45,451
you know,

6473
02:41:45,451 --> 02:41:46,710
there's professional sports.

6474
02:41:46,711 --> 02:41:47,131
I look at that,

6475
02:41:47,131 --> 02:41:49,860
like the money that is being made in
professional sports like there at some of

6476
02:41:49,861 --> 02:41:50,280
these guys are,

6477
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:51,360
a lot of these guys are going to go broke,

6478
02:41:51,690 --> 02:41:52,710
but in a,

6479
02:41:52,711 --> 02:41:55,260
in a hundred years we'll be
dealing with the Jordan Foundation.

6480
02:41:55,261 --> 02:41:56,700
The way we're dealing
with the Rockefellers,

6481
02:41:56,701 --> 02:41:57,360
you know what I'm saying?

6482
02:41:57,360 --> 02:41:59,070
Magic Johnson did a bad job.

6483
02:41:59,310 --> 02:42:00,180
Then at some point,

6484
02:42:00,210 --> 02:42:04,320
I hope that some of these people who have
this like fuck you money can actually

6485
02:42:04,321 --> 02:42:05,730
figure out a way to port back in,

6486
02:42:05,731 --> 02:42:07,560
but they can't necessarily
like charter schools.

6487
02:42:07,561 --> 02:42:11,370
Like Jalen rose has a charter school
specifically in Detroit to go,

6488
02:42:11,490 --> 02:42:13,770
I need to help jumpstart
this situation myself.

6489
02:42:13,771 --> 02:42:16,020
But it's hard to rely on
individuals to do that.

6490
02:42:16,380 --> 02:42:16,681
And the,

6491
02:42:16,681 --> 02:42:17,760
until America goes,

6492
02:42:17,940 --> 02:42:22,020
it's in our best interest to make
poor neighborhoods better and easier.

6493
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:23,060
And I'm not just on my black,

6494
02:42:23,070 --> 02:42:23,731
I just in general,

6495
02:42:23,731 --> 02:42:24,690
poor neighborhoods better.

6496
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:27,840
It will make a better country until
the government feels like that's an

6497
02:42:27,841 --> 02:42:28,674
important thing.

6498
02:42:28,770 --> 02:42:29,603
And also,

6499
02:42:30,210 --> 02:42:30,721
you know,

6500
02:42:30,721 --> 02:42:33,450
we have this one president that Brock
is pretty good and pretty liberal,

6501
02:42:33,451 --> 02:42:34,800
but we don't know what the
next one's going to look like.

6502
02:42:34,801 --> 02:42:37,320
And then the next one's going to look
like until the country sort of as a whole

6503
02:42:37,321 --> 02:42:38,100
goes,

6504
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:38,670
you know,

6505
02:42:38,670 --> 02:42:40,410
that we get to that tipping
point where we need to,

6506
02:42:40,440 --> 02:42:40,830
we should,

6507
02:42:40,830 --> 02:42:42,030
all the schools should be good.

6508
02:42:42,530 --> 02:42:43,090
You know,

6509
02:42:43,090 --> 02:42:43,610
uh,

6510
02:42:43,610 --> 02:42:44,330
health care,

6511
02:42:44,330 --> 02:42:45,210
it shouldn't bankrupt,

6512
02:42:45,211 --> 02:42:45,960
you know,

6513
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:46,651
you know you shouldn't,

6514
02:42:46,651 --> 02:42:47,220
you shouldn't get,

6515
02:42:47,220 --> 02:42:48,540
you shouldn't have a car accident.

6516
02:42:48,570 --> 02:42:50,730
It's amazing that we have
to even say these things.

6517
02:42:51,110 --> 02:42:53,610
It seems like it should
be like the staples of a,

6518
02:42:53,611 --> 02:42:54,510
a culture.

6519
02:42:54,540 --> 02:42:54,960
Yeah.

6520
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:55,793
That you know,

6521
02:42:55,910 --> 02:42:56,880
in the UK they go,

6522
02:42:56,881 --> 02:42:58,560
what do you mean you went
broke because you had,

6523
02:42:58,561 --> 02:43:00,090
because you've got a
broken leg or something.

6524
02:43:00,091 --> 02:43:04,170
You know why I always think of in terms
of what is the number one resource that

6525
02:43:04,171 --> 02:43:05,010
we have in America,

6526
02:43:05,011 --> 02:43:06,220
it's not natural resources.

6527
02:43:06,221 --> 02:43:07,054
It's human beings.

6528
02:43:07,290 --> 02:43:10,860
And wouldn't American be stronger if
there were less people that were losers?

6529
02:43:12,150 --> 02:43:15,610
So what's the best way to make less
people losers work with children?

6530
02:43:15,660 --> 02:43:16,070
I feel like,

6531
02:43:16,070 --> 02:43:19,750
I think they should have community centers
and in any poor neighborhoods have a

6532
02:43:19,751 --> 02:43:21,130
place where kids can escape.

6533
02:43:21,310 --> 02:43:25,150
That's really well staffed with
people that are excellent counselors,

6534
02:43:25,270 --> 02:43:29,770
people that are teaching
sports and martial arts and
places where kids can work

6535
02:43:29,771 --> 02:43:30,190
on theirs.

6536
02:43:30,190 --> 02:43:31,150
They're studying.

6537
02:43:31,151 --> 02:43:35,230
They could have computers to use to access
for books and all kinds of other shit

6538
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:38,350
so that they can have a place that they
can get in away from the crime and just

6539
02:43:38,351 --> 02:43:40,480
that alone will stop a
lot of fucking crime.

6540
02:43:40,690 --> 02:43:43,540
And it'll give kids a
place where they can,

6541
02:43:43,660 --> 02:43:45,220
they have a home away from home,

6542
02:43:45,250 --> 02:43:46,083
they have something.

6543
02:43:46,090 --> 02:43:48,400
So if their parents work
during the day and they don't,

6544
02:43:48,401 --> 02:43:50,740
they don't want to go home
and just stare at the walls.

6545
02:43:50,860 --> 02:43:51,940
They have somewhere to go to.

6546
02:43:51,970 --> 02:43:54,580
They have people that they can
look up to that can help them.

6547
02:43:54,581 --> 02:43:56,000
Counselors and you're,

6548
02:43:56,040 --> 02:44:00,130
you're giving people more of a chance to
be a successful human when you do that.

6549
02:44:00,190 --> 02:44:01,480
You're strengthening the country.

6550
02:44:01,481 --> 02:44:01,661
Yeah,

6551
02:44:01,661 --> 02:44:01,961
that's,

6552
02:44:01,961 --> 02:44:03,400
and I don't think people see it that way.

6553
02:44:03,401 --> 02:44:06,180
They see somehow like it's
again to hand out their animals,

6554
02:44:06,220 --> 02:44:08,210
their animals yourself
up by your bootstraps,

6555
02:44:08,460 --> 02:44:09,970
which to me is like crazy.

6556
02:44:10,090 --> 02:44:10,601
It's crazy.

6557
02:44:10,601 --> 02:44:12,610
And I think that people don't see,

6558
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:13,510
it's so stupid.

6559
02:44:13,511 --> 02:44:16,840
It's like if you have an infection
in your finger and you let it go,

6560
02:44:16,841 --> 02:44:18,040
it's going to kill you.

6561
02:44:18,041 --> 02:44:18,581
You know what I mean?

6562
02:44:18,581 --> 02:44:19,570
Like you have to sort of go,

6563
02:44:19,720 --> 02:44:23,500
we need to address this and theirs and
we can either address it now or we can

6564
02:44:23,501 --> 02:44:24,370
wait until like,

6565
02:44:24,371 --> 02:44:24,790
you know,

6566
02:44:24,790 --> 02:44:26,260
do we have to burn down Ferguson,

6567
02:44:26,261 --> 02:44:29,650
Missouri to get more cops to patrol?

6568
02:44:29,670 --> 02:44:29,920
Yeah.

6569
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:32,610
We might give up my place in Connecticut.

6570
02:44:32,630 --> 02:44:33,010
Yeah.

6571
02:44:33,010 --> 02:44:33,821
We need to get that cut.

6572
02:44:33,821 --> 02:44:34,930
Our cops need tanks.

6573
02:44:34,931 --> 02:44:36,740
Arts cops definitely need
tanks cause those blasts.

6574
02:44:36,741 --> 02:44:37,660
The Massey Ferguson.

6575
02:44:37,661 --> 02:44:37,911
Yeah.

6576
02:44:37,911 --> 02:44:38,240
Yeah.

6577
02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:40,600
Sentence drones that people don't take it.

6578
02:44:40,601 --> 02:44:41,470
They don't take it seriously.

6579
02:44:41,471 --> 02:44:42,580
And I think that that's the,

6580
02:44:42,581 --> 02:44:43,600
until you people go,

6581
02:44:43,630 --> 02:44:43,871
Oh,

6582
02:44:43,871 --> 02:44:44,200
if we've,

6583
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:46,720
if stronger communities
lead to a stronger America,

6584
02:44:46,990 --> 02:44:47,621
there should be thinking,

6585
02:44:47,621 --> 02:44:47,951
like you said,

6586
02:44:47,951 --> 02:44:49,840
there should be things that are just
taken for granted and you know how they're

6587
02:44:49,870 --> 02:44:50,530
going to do that.

6588
02:44:50,530 --> 02:44:50,890
Oh,

6589
02:44:50,890 --> 02:44:52,090
taxes from marijuana.

6590
02:44:52,270 --> 02:44:52,781
Yes,

6591
02:44:52,781 --> 02:44:53,441
exactly.

6592
02:44:53,441 --> 02:44:53,921
That's how,

6593
02:44:53,921 --> 02:44:55,150
that's my solution.

6594
02:44:55,151 --> 02:44:56,890
Ladies and gentleman legalized marijuana.

6595
02:44:57,100 --> 02:44:58,240
39% tax.

6596
02:44:58,241 --> 02:45:01,660
Like Colorado is doing hundreds of
millions of dollars at your disposal.

6597
02:45:01,710 --> 02:45:03,410
And I've heard the thing about the,

6598
02:45:03,460 --> 02:45:04,600
I don't know if they figured it out,

6599
02:45:04,601 --> 02:45:05,200
but like,

6600
02:45:05,200 --> 02:45:05,920
because you're,

6601
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:06,670
you,

6602
02:45:06,670 --> 02:45:08,980
you can't because the federal
government hasn't legalize marijuana.

6603
02:45:09,010 --> 02:45:11,340
There's all this money that the
pot dispensaries are making.

6604
02:45:11,340 --> 02:45:12,790
They're slowly starting to care.

6605
02:45:12,791 --> 02:45:13,624
Put it at the bank.

6606
02:45:14,350 --> 02:45:15,183
Exactly.

6607
02:45:15,430 --> 02:45:15,940
Just like,

6608
02:45:15,940 --> 02:45:16,181
oh,

6609
02:45:16,181 --> 02:45:17,200
come on America.

6610
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:17,950
Yeah,

6611
02:45:17,950 --> 02:45:21,010
well it's the federal government trying
to fuck with people and that's what it

6612
02:45:21,011 --> 02:45:21,350
is.

6613
02:45:21,350 --> 02:45:21,941
And not only that,

6614
02:45:21,941 --> 02:45:23,820
they're arresting people
that are using these,

6615
02:45:23,910 --> 02:45:25,120
these federal parks,

6616
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:27,910
like they're smoking weed
in states where it's legal,

6617
02:45:28,240 --> 02:45:31,450
but they go to the park and they s they
spark up a joint in a state park and

6618
02:45:31,451 --> 02:45:33,280
then the federal government
comes in and the rest of them,

6619
02:45:33,310 --> 02:45:36,250
even though Barack Obama I think
has been pretty clear about,

6620
02:45:36,251 --> 02:45:39,030
they're not trying to prosecute the
president of the United States is,

6621
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:40,450
is we're not trying to
go after these things.

6622
02:45:40,451 --> 02:45:41,201
Well,

6623
02:45:41,201 --> 02:45:42,970
he has been pretty clear about that.

6624
02:45:42,971 --> 02:45:43,691
However,

6625
02:45:43,691 --> 02:45:48,691
his administration and the
DEA has prosecuted a lot
of fucking people in states

6626
02:45:50,051 --> 02:45:51,580
where medical marijuana is legal.

6627
02:45:52,340 --> 02:45:53,650
The other thing they do,

6628
02:45:53,651 --> 02:45:54,484
which is really cute,

6629
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:55,750
is they arrest people.

6630
02:45:55,780 --> 02:45:56,710
They take all their weed,

6631
02:45:56,711 --> 02:45:59,860
they take all their money and then they
say the case is pending and they just

6632
02:45:59,861 --> 02:46:02,140
have to sit there and they
don't do anything about it.

6633
02:46:02,141 --> 02:46:05,980
But they stole $500,000 from
them in $1 million worth of weed.

6634
02:46:06,130 --> 02:46:08,350
And then just sit in there waiting to
find out whether or not you're going to go

6635
02:46:08,351 --> 02:46:09,184
to jail.

6636
02:46:09,350 --> 02:46:10,040
And some of them

6637
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:10,430
do.

6638
02:46:10,430 --> 02:46:12,650
I have a friend who's gone
to jail because of it.

6639
02:46:12,690 --> 02:46:17,300
I know several people that have gone to
jail during the Obama Administration for

6640
02:46:17,301 --> 02:46:18,920
selling medical marijuana that's legal.

6641
02:46:18,921 --> 02:46:21,170
So he's kind of full of
shit when it comes to that.

6642
02:46:21,171 --> 02:46:21,530
He's,

6643
02:46:21,530 --> 02:46:21,861
I mean he,

6644
02:46:21,861 --> 02:46:22,101
you know,

6645
02:46:22,101 --> 02:46:22,290
I,

6646
02:46:22,290 --> 02:46:23,300
I like,

6647
02:46:23,301 --> 02:46:24,090
I like Brock.

6648
02:46:24,090 --> 02:46:25,250
I'm not in love with him anymore,

6649
02:46:25,590 --> 02:46:26,271
but it happened.

6650
02:46:26,271 --> 02:46:27,104
Did you guys break up?

6651
02:46:27,110 --> 02:46:27,943
We broke.

6652
02:46:28,220 --> 02:46:29,053
What caused it?

6653
02:46:29,450 --> 02:46:30,283
What caused it?

6654
02:46:30,570 --> 02:46:31,041
For me,

6655
02:46:31,041 --> 02:46:33,470
the thing that actually caused it over
and over again was every time there was

6656
02:46:33,471 --> 02:46:34,160
like,

6657
02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:34,700
um,

6658
02:46:34,700 --> 02:46:35,720
like Troy Davis,

6659
02:46:35,721 --> 02:46:37,310
the guy who was on death row in Texas,

6660
02:46:37,311 --> 02:46:38,061
who people were like,

6661
02:46:38,061 --> 02:46:39,620
the evidence says that he didn't do it.

6662
02:46:39,830 --> 02:46:40,580
And there are people,

6663
02:46:40,580 --> 02:46:42,230
like I remember on Twitter
people like say something,

6664
02:46:42,231 --> 02:46:43,310
Brock say something.

6665
02:46:43,311 --> 02:46:44,210
Just if people were like,

6666
02:46:44,211 --> 02:46:45,200
well it's not his jurisdiction.

6667
02:46:45,201 --> 02:46:48,890
Every time there's an issue that is
that fall squarely on the head of black

6668
02:46:48,891 --> 02:46:51,560
people in this country and Barack
sort of tippy toes around her,

6669
02:46:51,561 --> 02:46:53,090
it doesn't address it head on soon enough.

6670
02:46:53,330 --> 02:46:54,230
I feel like he,

6671
02:46:54,410 --> 02:46:56,750
that's why we elected a black president.

6672
02:46:56,780 --> 02:46:58,310
That's why black people went out to vote.

6673
02:46:58,311 --> 02:47:02,300
It's because we wanted somebody who had
our back and every time he doesn't and

6674
02:47:02,301 --> 02:47:02,750
he can't,

6675
02:47:02,750 --> 02:47:03,820
he can't fix problems.

6676
02:47:03,821 --> 02:47:05,000
I don't expect them to fix things.

6677
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:08,330
But when it takes them four days to
talk about Ferguson and as he says,

6678
02:47:08,510 --> 02:47:10,310
he didn't want to say anything
too quickly or do you want to say,

6679
02:47:10,311 --> 02:47:12,650
cause he didn't want to be seen as
putting his thumb on the scale of justice.

6680
02:47:12,651 --> 02:47:12,950
I'm like,

6681
02:47:12,950 --> 02:47:13,401
Oh dude,

6682
02:47:13,401 --> 02:47:14,420
that's why I elected you.

6683
02:47:14,980 --> 02:47:16,790
I wanted your thumb on
the scale of justice.

6684
02:47:17,330 --> 02:47:18,170
And that's because that's what we,

6685
02:47:18,171 --> 02:47:18,531
it's again,

6686
02:47:18,531 --> 02:47:19,670
we need to jumpstart the system.

6687
02:47:19,671 --> 02:47:20,510
And so for me,

6688
02:47:20,960 --> 02:47:22,490
the stuff like that with uh,

6689
02:47:22,940 --> 02:47:23,241
you know,

6690
02:47:23,241 --> 02:47:24,074
with the sort of the,

6691
02:47:24,110 --> 02:47:24,830
and again,

6692
02:47:24,830 --> 02:47:25,161
yes,

6693
02:47:25,161 --> 02:47:26,480
if he talks about Trayvon Martin,

6694
02:47:26,570 --> 02:47:27,640
people go even,

6695
02:47:27,970 --> 02:47:28,270
even,

6696
02:47:28,270 --> 02:47:28,701
but I'm going,

6697
02:47:28,701 --> 02:47:28,851
yeah,

6698
02:47:28,851 --> 02:47:29,750
well that's the job.

6699
02:47:30,290 --> 02:47:31,280
The job is to get yelled at.

6700
02:47:31,281 --> 02:47:34,250
Sometimes the job is to take a hat is
to have a hard week because you take a

6701
02:47:34,251 --> 02:47:34,790
good stance.

6702
02:47:34,790 --> 02:47:36,530
If you take a stance anyway,

6703
02:47:36,531 --> 02:47:37,251
you're going to get yelled at.

6704
02:47:37,251 --> 02:47:37,540
Yeah.

6705
02:47:37,540 --> 02:47:38,990
So I don't pro or con,

6706
02:47:39,290 --> 02:47:43,410
if he took an Andrew Zimmerman stance
that George would have the fuck his name

6707
02:47:43,411 --> 02:47:44,060
is,

6708
02:47:44,060 --> 02:47:45,650
or he took a Trayvon Martin stance,

6709
02:47:45,680 --> 02:47:46,740
w whoevers side,

6710
02:47:46,741 --> 02:47:47,541
he cited on,

6711
02:47:47,541 --> 02:47:49,940
you're going to face
an assault of opinion.

6712
02:47:49,941 --> 02:47:53,930
But my contention is that black people
rallied around a black president because

6713
02:47:53,931 --> 02:47:54,201
they're like,

6714
02:47:54,201 --> 02:47:55,034
we meet,

6715
02:47:55,250 --> 02:47:55,551
you know,

6716
02:47:55,551 --> 02:47:55,971
born again.

6717
02:47:55,971 --> 02:47:57,110
Christians had a voice in the,

6718
02:47:57,111 --> 02:47:58,610
in the White House with George W.

6719
02:47:58,610 --> 02:48:00,880
Bush and George Bush did not hide
his boarding and Christian this,

6720
02:48:00,890 --> 02:48:01,430
he didn't,

6721
02:48:01,430 --> 02:48:01,761
he said,

6722
02:48:01,761 --> 02:48:02,660
God all the time.

6723
02:48:02,661 --> 02:48:03,301
He said,

6724
02:48:03,301 --> 02:48:04,610
where it God's because
you know that stuff.

6725
02:48:04,910 --> 02:48:05,743
Whereas Brock,

6726
02:48:06,590 --> 02:48:07,131
he know he,

6727
02:48:07,131 --> 02:48:07,521
he,

6728
02:48:07,521 --> 02:48:10,220
he's clearly walking a fine line,

6729
02:48:10,221 --> 02:48:10,880
which I get it.

6730
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:12,200
I wouldn't want to trade places with them.

6731
02:48:12,201 --> 02:48:13,190
I wouldn't want to be the first black,

6732
02:48:13,500 --> 02:48:14,900
that fifth black president,

6733
02:48:15,110 --> 02:48:16,640
any president or any president,

6734
02:48:16,641 --> 02:48:17,361
white president.

6735
02:48:17,361 --> 02:48:18,680
You did take the job.

6736
02:48:19,280 --> 02:48:20,200
You did go get it.

6737
02:48:20,270 --> 02:48:20,661
You didn't,

6738
02:48:20,661 --> 02:48:21,950
you didn't get assigned the job.

6739
02:48:21,980 --> 02:48:25,490
Don't you think that that job's
unimaginably difficult and unmanageable?

6740
02:48:25,491 --> 02:48:26,300
He difficult.

6741
02:48:26,300 --> 02:48:26,631
It is,

6742
02:48:26,631 --> 02:48:27,470
but you took the job.

6743
02:48:27,740 --> 02:48:28,150
I'm not,

6744
02:48:28,150 --> 02:48:28,701
I'm not,

6745
02:48:28,701 --> 02:48:29,250
you know,

6746
02:48:29,250 --> 02:48:29,480
it's,

6747
02:48:29,480 --> 02:48:29,721
yeah,

6748
02:48:29,721 --> 02:48:30,081
it is,

6749
02:48:30,081 --> 02:48:30,914
but just uh,

6750
02:48:31,160 --> 02:48:31,993
you know,

6751
02:48:32,030 --> 02:48:32,863
everything is,

6752
02:48:32,870 --> 02:48:34,940
we all have our things we
pick and it's hard to do.

6753
02:48:34,941 --> 02:48:36,110
It's hard to be a standup comedian,

6754
02:48:36,111 --> 02:48:36,800
but you,

6755
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:37,760
we took the job,

6756
02:48:37,780 --> 02:48:38,180
you know,

6757
02:48:38,180 --> 02:48:38,631
not saying it's,

6758
02:48:38,631 --> 02:48:39,870
I'm not comparing it to being a president,

6759
02:48:39,930 --> 02:48:40,880
a stand up comedian.

6760
02:48:40,890 --> 02:48:42,050
You can actually do it.

6761
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:43,510
You can't,

6762
02:48:43,510 --> 02:48:44,240
you're getting the,

6763
02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:44,721
the White House.

6764
02:48:44,721 --> 02:48:45,740
You can't actually be the president,

6765
02:48:45,741 --> 02:48:45,861
you know,

6766
02:48:45,861 --> 02:48:46,611
I cannot really,

6767
02:48:46,611 --> 02:48:48,290
the presidents get in there,

6768
02:48:48,291 --> 02:48:48,590
man.

6769
02:48:48,590 --> 02:48:53,330
You are faced with just a fucking tidal
wave of special interest groups and

6770
02:48:53,331 --> 02:48:55,740
money and pull and push.

6771
02:48:55,790 --> 02:48:56,623
Probably.

6772
02:48:56,930 --> 02:48:58,760
It's probably similar to having
your own late night talk show.

6773
02:48:58,761 --> 02:48:59,001
They go,

6774
02:48:59,001 --> 02:49:00,140
this is how it's done.

6775
02:49:00,680 --> 02:49:01,850
You're going to do a cold opening.

6776
02:49:01,851 --> 02:49:03,350
But I don't want to do a cold opening,

6777
02:49:03,351 --> 02:49:06,290
except you never get to that Jon Stewart
position where you'd tell everybody to

6778
02:49:06,291 --> 02:49:06,900
fuck off.

6779
02:49:06,900 --> 02:49:07,100
No,

6780
02:49:07,100 --> 02:49:10,090
because you don't get to be
president for 20 years too,

6781
02:49:10,160 --> 02:49:12,690
but you'll be in the
show is not the country.

6782
02:49:12,691 --> 02:49:12,901
Yeah.

6783
02:49:12,901 --> 02:49:13,081
No,

6784
02:49:13,081 --> 02:49:13,914
it's not the country,

6785
02:49:14,460 --> 02:49:14,761
dude.

6786
02:49:14,761 --> 02:49:15,510
We're out of time.

6787
02:49:15,510 --> 02:49:15,900
We did.

6788
02:49:15,900 --> 02:49:16,890
We just did three hours.

6789
02:49:17,100 --> 02:49:18,840
I knew I was coming in
here for the long haul,

6790
02:49:18,841 --> 02:49:22,010
but through and through I was
a trying to keep the ball.

6791
02:49:22,110 --> 02:49:22,943
That was fun.

6792
02:49:23,280 --> 02:49:24,330
What are you doing next?

6793
02:49:24,331 --> 02:49:24,811
Is there any,

6794
02:49:24,811 --> 02:49:27,420
if you have any projects in the
world could look forward to?

6795
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:27,751
Yeah,

6796
02:49:27,751 --> 02:49:29,160
I do have a big project in the world.

6797
02:49:29,161 --> 02:49:29,521
First of all,

6798
02:49:29,521 --> 02:49:32,070
I'm taking a month off because my
wife's going to have our second kid.

6799
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:32,400
Uh,

6800
02:49:32,400 --> 02:49:33,630
but people can't look forward to that.

6801
02:49:33,660 --> 02:49:34,590
But then in November,

6802
02:49:34,591 --> 02:49:36,720
I'm going out him like my
most extensive tour ever.

6803
02:49:37,030 --> 02:49:37,650
Oh,

6804
02:49:37,650 --> 02:49:37,861
cool.

6805
02:49:37,861 --> 02:49:38,341
Beautiful.

6806
02:49:38,341 --> 02:49:39,840
It's called the owe everything to her.

6807
02:49:40,350 --> 02:49:41,010
Everything.

6808
02:49:41,010 --> 02:49:41,170
Oh,

6809
02:49:41,170 --> 02:49:42,003
everything.

6810
02:49:42,510 --> 02:49:43,200
What's wrong.

6811
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:43,411
Oh,

6812
02:49:43,411 --> 02:49:44,244
everything.

6813
02:49:44,540 --> 02:49:47,850
So I will be hitting a mini markets.

6814
02:49:47,851 --> 02:49:49,320
I would like that I've never hit before.

6815
02:49:49,321 --> 02:49:50,520
And then places I love to go to.

6816
02:49:50,521 --> 02:49:51,210
So beautiful.

6817
02:49:51,210 --> 02:49:51,630
Yeah.

6818
02:49:51,630 --> 02:49:52,081
So,

6819
02:49:52,081 --> 02:49:52,441
uh,

6820
02:49:52,441 --> 02:49:53,151
your website,
