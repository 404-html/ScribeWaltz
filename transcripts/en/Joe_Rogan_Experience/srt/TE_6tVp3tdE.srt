00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,460
Hello Freak bitches.
But I look at that the same way I kind

2
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:09,000
of look at music or the same way I look
at writing or comedy or anything.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,210
So it's fascinating to me watching
someone go after something and,

4
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:16,650
and,
and put it together and make something

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:20,820
that is almost unfathomable take place,
whether it's a creation of an album,

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,140
whether it's a,
you know,

7
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,880
a comedy special,
whether it's a,

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,840
someone writes an amazing book.
I love when people get shit done.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,850
Yeah.
I do too.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,110
It's a beautiful thing.
Yeah.

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,453
Right.
Yeah.

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,931
Well,
as artists,

13
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:36,351
right?
Like,

14
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:37,190
does that,
like,

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,570
as,
as an artist,

16
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:42,070
does that inspire you when you see,
like if you go to see a great movie or

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,460
read a great book or something like
that,

18
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,310
does that inspire you to want to create?
Yeah.

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,400
It doesn't inspire me to create a write
a book.

20
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,821
Right,
right,

21
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:52,840
right.
But,

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,930
um,
I think I kind of know what my lane is

23
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,000
at this point.
Yeah.

24
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,700
You know,
I try and stay in it.

25
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,900
Yeah.
Um,

26
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,750
but yeah,
I mean definitely go see a movie or,

27
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,130
or,
or read,

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,240
uh,
you know,

29
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,210
and,
and it,

30
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:15,080
it'll get my creative juices flowing and
you know,

31
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:19,340
inspire me to be,
to just be better and try and

32
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:20,720
contribute,
you know what I mean?

33
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:23,660
Contributes something good or be
positive and make,

34
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,410
make myself feel something to make
somebody else feel something.

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,273
I Dunno.
It,

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,480
it does something to me.
Definitely.

37
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:32,600
It's hard to describe.
I was still can't describe what it is

38
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:36,110
that makes this creative thing,
um,

39
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,790
click or explain how I do what I do.
But

40
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,730
definitely seeing movies or hearing you
know,

41
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,680
here and um,
you know,

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,160
great musicians,
great guitar players,

43
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,870
you know,
the freak me out.

44
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,090
Oh Shit,
don't get too involved a little bit.

45
00:01:58,091 --> 00:01:59,200
You know what I mean?
And I'm like,

46
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,093
well,
no hunger.

47
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:01,970
Yeah.
Though.

48
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,621
It's like,
okay,

49
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:05,000
I respect that.
Let me go get you hit on my game.

50
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,900
And yeah,
this guy was born in the 60s you know

51
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:09,640
what I mean?
Exactly what we're here to take over

52
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:11,890
yogas,
thousands of years old,

53
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,140
the balls,
the balls on this guy,

54
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:17,860
literally all tucked away.
And that little grape smuggler any

55
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:21,070
worse.
There was a guy in my class that used to

56
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:22,930
go there for a while.
He used to wear the crepe smuggler.

57
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,710
He was very sot nom.
He was very [inaudible] know,

58
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,750
hit a man bun to smugglers and a man
bun.

59
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,960
I want to beat you up in the parking
lot.

60
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,033
Oh,
totally.

61
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,890
Totally.
And I think the other women look at you

62
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:37,810
over there and your Nike workout stuff
and they're like,

63
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:38,500
all right,
he's,

64
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,333
he's fine.

65
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,191
They think so.
Yeah.

66
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:42,130
They're like,
thank you for not doing that.

67
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,260
I hope so.
I hope so.

68
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,570
I don't know.
The place I go to is very nice,

69
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,420
very nice people.
But again,

70
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,080
it's not like the hot young hard,
but I'm probably the best looking girl

71
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:55,990
in the class
a road.

72
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,280
It was a joke.
I couldn't help it.

73
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,860
That's not true either.
Some cute ones,

74
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:01,930
but the point being is that's not what
it is.

75
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,010
It's a,
you know,

76
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,230
but there is a sexual vibe there.
D I mean,

77
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,250
you're just there to do yoga,
but yet there is that kind of thing and

78
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,230
which is why I'm not too big a fan of
the classes.

79
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:15,460
The team you up where they want you to
partner up for this thing.

80
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,360
Yeah.
You ever have that?

81
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,021
No.
Oh,

82
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:18,370
like you stretch you out.
Yeah.

83
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,560
They're like,
I get a partner.

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,780
Get unhappy baby with your legs behind
with your partner pushed down on you and

85
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:25,180
you're like,
you know,

86
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,880
you're fired on this lady.
Don't what happens.

87
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,510
That'd be actually the smart board as a
married man.

88
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,850
That would be the smart man.
How much porn takes place in the Yoga

89
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:36,640
Student Yoga Studio where the yoga that
teacher says,

90
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,620
um,
I would like to review some poses with

91
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:41,170
you after class.
I'll give you some tips.

92
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,790
That'd be like,
if you were,

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,460
let's,
let's just be as politically correct

94
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:50,230
about this possible.
If you were single and the person

95
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:54,130
actually was into you and this all went
down according to this,

96
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,120
this,
that would be the greatest like fantasy

97
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:00,220
ever.
Like you're in that hot yoga class,

98
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:02,800
all hot and Sweaty,
and afterwards the teacher wants to fuck

99
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,350
God.
Damn.

100
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,640
She's like,
Tom,

101
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:09,940
I just really feel like your practice
could aid with just a little private one

102
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,540
on one instruction.
Yes,

103
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,970
sure,
sure.

104
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,200
The first,
we're going to start with a foot

105
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:15,110
massage.
Um,

106
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,140
okay.
Slide on your back.

107
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,270
Um,
all right.

108
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,360
Oh,
okay.

109
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:21,370
And she's rubbing your feet and lifting
your legs.

110
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,580
I'm just going to stretch your legs out
and she's rubbing the inside of your

111
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:29,200
thighs and you start moaning.
She moans back and the next thing you

112
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:30,730
know,
it's on Tom Papa.

113
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,100
Oh,
I'm gonna stay

114
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,800
[inaudible].
Okay.
