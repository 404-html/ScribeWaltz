1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,873
Hello,

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,730
but the idea that giving someone a gun
makes them more likely to kill people.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:08,930
I'm not sure if I buy that.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,200
When the La riots were going on,

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,050
a lot of people had their
own personal firearms and uh,

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,980
this guy I know he said he had to like
go on the roof of his apartment with a

7
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:25,250
gun because they were trying to break
into his house and stuff like that and he

8
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:29,960
actually had to shoot somebody
shot somebody in the arm
or something like that.

9
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:30,794
I think he said,

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,173
who is this guy?

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,193
I don't want to say.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,400
It might be a bullshitter.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,290
I can tell you off air a bullshitter.

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:36,970
No,

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,803
absolutely not.

16
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,660
Occasionally,

17
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,420
never know.

18
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,760
What's the dictates like

19
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,973
popcorn group,

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,873
your poop.

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,090
It's not that far away.

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,620
This is

23
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:54,970
bullshit.

24
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,060
We don't even know.

25
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,920
You don't even know they're
working on these things.

26
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:58,970
Nobody knows of them,

27
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,050
but yet they are like that close to
going public and they're fucking.

28
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,080
Everybody has to swipe key cards
before they go into the building.

29
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,430
They check your bag,

30
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,140
they make sure you don't bring your phone.

31
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:11,010
Your phone has to go into a
bucket when you go into the,

32
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,230
into the laboratory,

33
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,790
because this is all propriety.

34
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,080
Proprietary Shit.

35
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,260
They're checking their.

36
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,820
They probably have this fucking fake
buttons that are really cameras and shit.

37
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,320
I'm gonna.

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,071
See your glasses.

39
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:21,590
What do you want to see?

40
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,630
Was fucking glasses glasses.

41
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:26,810
Now they have glasses with little tiny
cameras and I'm literally like so hard to

42
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:27,410
see.

43
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,970
If you look at your selfie camera,

44
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,540
look how little that goddamn
lenses like the selfie one,

45
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,550
like the one on the back is tiny,

46
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:34,790
right?

47
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,690
Look at my iphone here,

48
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,390
but the one the front is fucking stupid.

49
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:39,170
Tiny.

50
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,660
It's so little and it's good.

51
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,070
It's really good.

52
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:43,671
I mean,

53
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,830
look how good a selfie camera is.

54
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,521
I mean they.

55
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:50,600
They do a fucking incredible
job of capturing your image.

56
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,733
Like look at this,

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,620
look at that.

58
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,110
Yeah.

59
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,580
That's a tiny ass little little pinpoint
camera and it's got everyone in this

60
00:01:58,581 --> 00:02:03,080
room to the point where you could
broadcast periscope from this thing that's

61
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,400
like a sharpie if you took a
sharpie and dotted a page with it.

62
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:11,300
Just that's how big that cameras
and yet it's crystal clear.

63
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,740
So that could be in your button.

64
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,280
That could be in any.

65
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,280
If they're not physically
patting you down,

66
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,380
you could easily have
something like that going on.

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:18,661
Yeah.

68
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:20,800
The one I use in massage
parlors looks like a car.

69
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:21,880
A car alarm.

70
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,580
See you're on the air kitchen.

71
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,830
Oh the fuck man.

72
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,791
But it's a video.

73
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,810
I filmed a 10 80 p,

74
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,020
a film massage parlors.

75
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:31,830
Do you?

76
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,663
No.

77
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,120
Good.

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,953
I mean the one,

79
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,130
uh,

80
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,671
it's uh,

81
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:39,570
it's like actually just looks
like a little key chain,

82
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:40,404
but if it does,

83
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,281
it does 10,

84
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:42,001
80 p.

85
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:43,860
like if you had a little memory card,

86
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:45,630
just put it in your computer
and next thing you know,

87
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:46,231
it's just like,

88
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:46,441
oh,

89
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:47,700
you got full video.

90
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,410
You just put it on the
nightstand next to it,

91
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,071
pointed towards it.

92
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:51,720
The girl hats.

93
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,370
Anything that's really illegal though.

94
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,090
I'm kidding.

95
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,661
I don't do it.

96
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:57,580
That's the only you do.

97
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,980
There's other thing you were
telling me where in Brazil or I

98
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,780
thought was fascinating was that there,

99
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,351
there,

100
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:06,850
there's a new type of testosterone that
they are making testosterone from Yams,

101
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,630
right?

102
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,010
Correct.

103
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,330
That now they're doing it through animals.

104
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,721
Yeah,

105
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:11,340
they are.

106
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,950
Um,

107
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,420
so,

108
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:12,640
you know,

109
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,320
one of the most accurate test now to use
is called the carbon isotope ratio test

110
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,300
and what that's able to do
is differentiate between
natural testosterone which

111
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:26,740
all men and women have in their body and
foreign testosterone because there's a

112
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:30,580
different carbon atom in that testosterone
because it's made from a plant

113
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,870
instead of an animal.

114
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,813
There's now,

115
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,730
at least in research supply companies,

116
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:38,530
I don't think it's approved for use,

117
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:43,180
but there's animal based testosterone
floating around which has the potential to

118
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,370
possibly defeat a carbon isotope ratio
tests because it has the same carbon atom

119
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,140
as natural testosterone does.

120
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,070
Is there any hesitation and talking
about these things because you worry that

121
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,330
you might educate cheaters?

122
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,260
No,

123
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,951
I don't think so.

124
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:57,460
I think,

125
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,060
you know,

126
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,170
I've always found that,

127
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,860
you know,

128
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,100
your credibility rises when you're
forthright about what's going on.

129
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,330
Um,

130
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,220
and [inaudible] on the
other side of things,

131
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,910
um,

132
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,420
you know,

133
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,460
the sciences,

134
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,071
you know,

135
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:11,650
looking at these things and
always coming up with new tests.

136
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,060
I think something that's fact,

137
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,230
I just read it today,

138
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,551
um,

139
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:16,300
and we do this in our program as well,

140
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,673
is uh,

141
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,970
there was in cycling,

142
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,530
they will freeze samples both urine and
blood and keep them for years at a time

143
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,100
and cycling just recently went back and
retested some of the frozen urine and

144
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:30,910
blood from a few years ago,

145
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:31,630
uh,

146
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,340
for a new drug with shade,

147
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,140
just develop a test for and they were
able to catch a guy from a couple of years

148
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,861
ago that had used it.

149
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,480
We're going to do that and UFC as well.

150
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,314
So even if,

151
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,920
you know,

152
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,720
there's a new drug out there that,

153
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,973
you know,

154
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,851
scientists,

155
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:50,230
chemists are saying there's no test for
potentially a couple years down the line

156
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,200
when there is a test forward,

157
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,200
we'd have the ability to
go back and test that.

158
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,190
Now maybe that athletes no longer with
the UFC are no longer competing at all

159
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:57,611
anymore,

160
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:58,760
but you know,

161
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,480
there's still reputation
and legacy at stake.

162
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,111
Wow,

163
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:02,711
that's crazy.

164
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:06,730
So the UFC is going to have like a giant
meat locker filled with old blood and p

165
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,580
laboratories will have that.

166
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,423
Yeah.

167
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,241
Wow,

168
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:10,841
that's a,

169
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,100
that's fascinating stuff.

170
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:12,934
But doesn't that.

171
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,421
Well,

172
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:15,560
there's a chain of evidence
issue with that isn't there?

173
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:18,040
Which just sitting around in
some sort of a lab somewhere.

174
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,113
What was.

175
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,511
Yeah,

176
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:23,890
there'll be secure freezers where there
is a chain of custody that goes along

177
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:24,581
with each sample.

178
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:27,040
So outside that freezer will be guard.

179
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:27,840
That's paperwork.

180
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,440
No,

181
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,600
the water laboratories are very secure.

182
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,434
Laboratories is this,

183
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,480
I've tried to get in than before.

184
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,141
Tough.

185
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:37,930
You're signing off your life
to get in one of those things.

186
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:38,960
But um,

187
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,611
no.

188
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:40,121
So there's,

189
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,950
the chain of custody will be good,

190
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,400
you know,

191
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,990
going on indefinitely on those things.

192
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:44,651
So,

193
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:45,880
so far as you know,

194
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:49,650
this hasn't been approved where
people haven't used this animal based

195
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:50,500
testosterone yet.

196
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,850
I believe it's being used now.

197
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,780
You believe it is?

198
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,673
Yeah.

199
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,980
But he came to you out of nowhere and
I've got to remember the job we came to

200
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,800
you out of here.

201
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,830
You're just listening and boom,

202
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:05,000
that's the home run that people remember
because it wasn't thought about ahead

203
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:08,450
of time was just listening to the
mountain looking and you know,

204
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,170
when you're roasting people listening is
also looking like taking a good look at

205
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:16,010
assessing exactly what's
been put in front of you.

206
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,520
Uh,

207
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,340
when you were doing the prison thing and
you talked to the guy and you said you

208
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:22,150
look at a combination of a
child and a child molester.

209
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,490
Yeah.

210
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,410
You're the rare person looks like a child
and a child molester at the same time.

211
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,270
And he did,

212
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,631
you know,

213
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,060
it wasn't like he did.

214
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:32,351
Yeah.

215
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,290
Nailed it there.

216
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,950
I just say try to say out loud what
people normally would say behind people's

217
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:37,784
backs.

218
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,420
Hence the karate self defense.

219
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,470
I do remember early instances of hecklers
before I knew anything about roasting.

220
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,460
It was just a comedian,

221
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:46,791
you know,

222
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,850
usually emceeing,

223
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:48,770
uh,

224
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,131
you know,

225
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:50,570
on the road or in Jersey,

226
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:50,961
you know,

227
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:55,850
or you had a lot of characters
and in the audience.

228
00:06:55,851 --> 00:07:00,851
And I remember a few times people taking
swings at me or just walking on stage.

229
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:03,620
I was working with rich
vos at a firehouse,

230
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:03,981
you know,

231
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:05,930
I'd only been doing comedy a year or two,

232
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,960
and I opened for him at some sort
of fundraiser to firehouse and

233
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,810
I was about five minutes into my routine,

234
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,040
a Saturday night.

235
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,290
These firemen are in their firehouse.

236
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:18,670
There's,

237
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,503
this is,

238
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,803
you know,

239
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,980
this is before there were any
rules to anything as far as,

240
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,263
you know,

241
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,661
uh,

242
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,970
and they kept telling me,

243
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:29,870
make fun of Larry,

244
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:30,770
make fun of Larry.

245
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:31,401
He loves it.

246
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:34,660
Make Fun of Larry and I don't
know who Larry is and you know,

247
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,390
of course Larry turned out to be the
biggest asshole on the planet who doesn't

248
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,260
love it at all.

249
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,940
And he literally was gigantic and walked
up on stage and took the microphone out

250
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:44,490
of my hand,

251
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,860
put it in the mic stand and said,

252
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,813
you're done.

253
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,750
Wow.

254
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,080
Was the audience laughing before that?

255
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,280
I don't remember.

256
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,440
I'm sure they weren't laughing enough.

257
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,210
I just remember it being so
hard and it just builds up.

258
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:05,110
You're gonna have to have thick skin
and you got to be able to like stare.

259
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,380
You got to have confidence
that you know you're,

260
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,160
you're in the right.
