1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,520
Jamie is too hot in here.
Turn the AC up,

2
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,930
Jamie.
Please look up.

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,910
See if anyone has.
Let's go champ.

4
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:26,400
Tattooed on their belly.
See if find that Janet men with a

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,990
crocodile scarring.
Jamie,

6
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:33,260
see if he could pull that up.
See I a plane crashes in Mexico with

7
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,780
tons of cocaine.
They overloaded their plane.

8
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,540
Jamie,
pull up some video of Al Jolson in

9
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,900
blackface.
So I tweeted something today that

10
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:45,110
somebody tweeted me or I read something
that somebody tweeted,

11
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,550
so I quoted it,
but it wasn't right.

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,570
God dammit.
That was pretty close that Donald trump

13
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:55,571
will be 70 years old and six days.
So it is seven months in,

14
00:00:58,611 --> 00:00:59,900
six days.
Seven months.

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,150
Seven year olds,
70 years old.

16
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:03,470
Seven months in,
six days.

17
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:08,471
Almost seven year old years old.
Seven months and seven days when he

18
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:13,811
becomes the president.
And he won by 77 electoral votes from

19
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:16,310
seven electors.
Wow.

20
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,740
Happy seventh anniversary of the gre to

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,090
basically it pretty glow tomorrow.
Yeah.

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,140
How crazy is that?

23
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,520
That is crazy.
So a lot of sevens.

24
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,770
Why are you obsessed with seven?
It's like,

25
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:34,400
why is your shirt came from the.
Are One time we're talking about how we

26
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:38,900
were in a simulation theory and how
everything's made out of ones and Zeros

27
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,480
and I said something like,
I'm going to hack it.

28
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:43,880
I'm ready to start saying sevens or
some.

29
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:46,460
I can't even remember what it was,
but it's all from that.

30
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,720
So this is your shirt that has all
sevens.

31
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,181
It's.
Yeah,

32
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:50,570
it's made from sevens.

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,280
It is a whole.
It's just a bunch of different color

34
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,114
sevens.
Yeah.

35
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,023
To make the artwork.

36
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,580
And this sweatshirts the desk squad
seven slash 11 shirt

37
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,330
episode seven,
seven seven.

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,140
So I thought it had to be you because of
all the,

39
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:05,980
your seven references that you threw in
all throughout the years at number

40
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:06,940
haunts me.
So bad.

41
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,470
Why?
I don't know.

42
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:11,230
It just comes up so much now.
Okay,

43
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,420
sure.
I have a seven on my shirt.

44
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:14,580
Do you?
Uh,

45
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,423
I dunno,
I might.

46
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,230
I don't give a fuck.
How about that?

47
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,810
You gave a seven on your hat,
Brian.

48
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,490
A dumber pigeons to.
Well look,

49
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,440
I'll in their heads are mad if your head
was that little.

50
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,173
Yeah,
I guess,

51
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,390
but
I mean Zika babies grow up to be pretty

52
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:36,330
smart.
Nope,

53
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,250
we haven't had any.
That's true.

54
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,840
Actually.
It hasn't grown up.

55
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,160
I really.
I don't think so.

56
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,050
I mean,
not that I've ever heard of.

57
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:45,360
I just made that up.
I think there's actually adult Zika

58
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,800
babies.
I think so because I was thinking about

59
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,060
making Zika hats for Zika people,
so it makes it look like their heads are

60
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:51,894
bigger.

61
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,020
The whole key is to get somebody who
spars with you.

62
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,670
That's not trying to hurt you,
but it's just trying to grow with you

63
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:03,820
and learn.
That's so hard because egos get involved

64
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:05,350
late.
George would never hurt you.

65
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,840
What?
Boy?

66
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:08,920
George.
Who would never heard you?

67
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,380
Oh,
sorry.

68
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,030
All right.
That's it.

69
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,180
Where else we're going to go?
No,

70
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,150
that looks like he's fully hard to deck
guys.

71
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,680
Giant.
It's a giant Dick.

72
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,440
Come on son.
You know that Shit's real.

73
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,350
You want it to be real.
No,

74
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,060
I'm scared.
She that could just be.

75
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,430
Oh look,
he's got marijuana leaf tattooed right

76
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,510
above his dick.
Like,

77
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,760
what's that supposed to mean?
Yeah,

78
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,540
smoke it,
smoke it if he got it.

79
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,920
Hashtags he has on there.
How does body

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,270
will change your life drops,
Mike.

81
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,770
Restructure your day.
This dick

82
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,060
edges slick down.
This dick can file your nails.

83
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,300
This dick.
This tongue will make you late for work.

84
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:02,250
Wait,
this dick can be a best friend.

85
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,180
This dick console and bundles.
I'm not sure what that means.

86
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,670
If you can.
I'll eat a pussy.

87
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh,
you can take the whole thing.

88
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,910
Can you not?
If you can only Hashtag.

89
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:22,911
If you can eat your pussy till scandal
comes back on next week.

90
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,180
What the fuck?
He's funny.

91
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,540
Dick.
Game strong.

92
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,480
I love that.
I love this one

93
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,620
world.
Somebody figured out a way to distribute

94
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:41,040
information through fucking pipes and a
numbers.

95
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:45,510
It's decoded back into letters,
ones and Zeros and this would have came

96
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,240
to Hashtag Dick Games.
Drawing.

97
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,850
You just be dealing with people with
problems all the time.

98
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,520
I don't think that's a good idea.
Just make your dicks off.

99
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,600
That's why.
Is that do it?

100
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,623
Yeah.

101
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,220
Yeah.
When someone tells you their problems,

102
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,680
I always feel like if you tell me your
problems,

103
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,010
you're making my Dick's off problems
make you dig south.

104
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:07,940
I've never.
Well,

105
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,260
I always felt like that when I was
dating,

106
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:11,930
you know,
it's like,

107
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,970
oh,
the girl,

108
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,680
she starts telling your problems,
you're like,

109
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,250
man,
you making them

110
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,350
ticks off.
Cheer Up,

111
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,740
boy.
Fuck.

112
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,920
What'd you think of him?
I loved.

113
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,270
Yeah.
I forgive him for dancing in the street

114
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,840
in the street with him and Mick Jagger,
Chicago.

115
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:30,580
I've been to forgive them.
I forgive them for arguably the most

116
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,510
confusing sexually,
at least to a young man.

117
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:35,920
I'm like,
what is happening?

118
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,380
What's going on with my.
What's that?

119
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,720
About why they freeze frame on that.
But is that you?

120
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:43,000
Did you do that Jamie?
Or is that the actual video?

121
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,920
That's how it ends.
That's unfortunate

122
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,380
when you go to whatever his boxing or
UFC,

123
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,700
the undercard no one's there.
They're all out getting drinks and

124
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:55,880
waiting for the thing that they don't
understand to happen.

125
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:58,010
That's at the end.
So

126
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,970
it's dead silent.
Bingo Hall Church.

127
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:06,800
Silence.
So you can heckle from the back row.

128
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:11,801
But Joe Rogan good as second row,
so it's absolutely quiet and we're in

129
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:17,030
their heckling.
Let me take your fucking him in the ass.

130
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:17,311
No,
no,

131
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:17,451
no,
no.

132
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:20,960
Let me take it for granted because I
wasn't heckling at all because Douglas

133
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,020
doesn't do marijuana.
Joseph does marijuana.

134
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,500
Douglas does alcohol.
Joseph does marijuana.

135
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,160
Joseph's freaking out because Douglas is
heckling them on your ticket and I'm

136
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,450
fucking laugh.
Or you're the one who brought me in.

137
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,130
So I'm kind of your responsibility.
Yeah,

138
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,690
try making him come.
That always knocks me out like a light.

139
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,750
I've been baking bread lately.
Holy Shit.

140
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:47,600
Sourdough bread.
Sourdough bread is very good for you.

141
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,980
It is.
Has Gluten though?

142
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,860
No,
I can't even ice skate.

143
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,400
Serious.
Can I scale it all?

144
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,630
Go.
Fuck.

145
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,490
I cannot escape.
Incredibly man.

146
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:04,970
I'm fucking again.
I'm waiting five on a good day.

147
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,880
You had them on the podcast.
Yeah.

148
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,671
No,
no.

149
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:10,620
You did a 100 percent sure he.
Nope,

150
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,200
he,
he came in with Eddie Wong.

151
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,060
But Roy Choi's,
a very famous chef,

152
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,540
one of the most famous famous chefs in
La Right now on episode was this type in

153
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:21,300
Roy.
Uh,

154
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,960
Joe Rogan.
I promise you because I watched it and I

155
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:25,310
was like.
So he was with Eddie?

156
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,900
Yeah.
No,

157
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,220
nope.
He was.

158
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,990
No,
I'm 100 percent certain.

159
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,620
Well,
I fight that Google's right.

160
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,240
Nope.
I a 100 percent certain.

161
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,750
Eddie Wong came in one time with the guy
that was in that movie of the interview.

162
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,910
I'm going to go to the mat on this one.
I'm looking at it right now and you're

163
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:46,040
wrong.
I'm really laid down on the Internet,

164
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,990
not backing me up with this boy toy
thing.

165
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:51,460
And I started.
It looks like I'm pretty sure he's

166
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,660
right.
He's not right.

167
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,640
He's right,

168
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,473
right?

169
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,510
Is that racist?
Racist.

170
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,040
It's just a gong.
Can we get away with a gong for anybody

171
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,350
gets mad at me?
David Cho or that you're thinking of?

172
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,700
No,
it's Roy Choi.

173
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,660
Burt.
Roy Choi was an episode of getting Doug

174
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:13,270
with high with Horacio Sands.
Uh,

175
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,090
Hiroshi CEO and me have often been
confused

176
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,090
way.
Yes.

177
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,790
Yes you are.
Are you serious?

178
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,890
You know it happens.
It's no big deal.

179
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,170
Burt wanted a minute.
Look at me.

180
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,310
Very competitive.
Very competitive.

181
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,290
Getting Doug with high
effective dose is 20.

182
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,930
And what does he pop?
Pop to?

183
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:43,520
Two hundred and effective drawing over.
Fuck Cap.

184
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,490
He'll drive.
Well,

185
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,230
what?
I can't,

186
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,060
uh,
I can't.

187
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,180
I can smoke three,
I got the.

188
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,780
I could open up with three of these.
I can open up with 600 milligrams.

189
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,703
Just

190
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,300
no idea how insanely bed at night.
Like a baby.

191
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:03,480
I put that basket on.
I sleep like a fucking baby,

192
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,060
so it was just joey,
myself and the driver and we get in the

193
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:09,800
car.
There's no music on.

194
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,620
We're just talking and we just hit one
of those moments,

195
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:16,160
you know when you're on a highway at
night and you kind of hit that thing

196
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:18,530
where it's like you just.
Everyone stopped talking for a minute

197
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,850
and you're looking out the window and
you can feel like I'm just kind of

198
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:25,010
staring off.
No one's talking.

199
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,910
And then after like 15 seconds of
silence,

200
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,430
Julia goes,
that will tell you.

201
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:35,030
By the time I saw a guy cut open at the
tenderloin in 1979,

202
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,950
stomach split wide open.
And I was like,

203
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,610
what?
And I just see the driver's eyes widen.

204
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,660
And I was like,
no.

205
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:42,111
He goes,
yeah,

206
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:44,750
it's blood was brown because he was
bleeding for so long.

207
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,980
People just stepped over him and I saw
two guys stab each other.

208
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,920
Fucking street,
1980,

209
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,960
just over.
Nothing.

210
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:56,180
They just stab each other.
I didn't almost shit my pants,

211
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:59,240
but then I got used to it.
And then you just see the driver

212
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,710
like he can.
He can add in.

213
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,380
Oh Jesus Christ.
Oh Jesus.

214
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,590
Oh Jesus.
Fucking Christ Jesus.

215
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,780
Oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.

216
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,030
Fucking Christ.
Oh my God.

217
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,860
Oh my God.
Jesus.

218
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,580
This is fucking tremendous.
Liquidity them again.

219
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:27,581
This is hard against broken
down like,

220
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,410
oh,
Jesus,

221
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,690
control.
Oh yeah,

222
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,670
but he doesn't know where he is.
He doesn't know where he is.

223
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,880
He doesn't know.
He doesn't know he is.

224
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,000
This is hard against fucking
cocksuckers.

225
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,440
I've been waiting for this bucket fight
for three fucking months.

226
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,250
This is what I'm talking about.
This is what the fucking problem is.

227
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:50,370
Okay?
You went to the body.

228
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,660
Every once in awhile,
you run into a fucking wall.

229
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,840
This Guy Diaz the fuck.
Are these people looking at shit.

230
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,250
You gotta kill this motherfucker.
Get over.

231
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,320
There's a new one.
50 five West.

232
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:09,200
Got Him now.
Where's the Gregor?

233
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:13,100
Now this catch Philadelphia.
You know motherfuckers,

234
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,610
Eddie Alvarez,
this is crazy.

235
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,070
I told you this is the fight in a bucket
year.

236
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,460
You fucking Momo totally sharp with your
bullshit.

237
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:27,461
Brock Lesnar and mark fucking art stuff
compared to this goddamn use.

238
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,150
God Damn Eddie Alvarez.
I told you I was excited when you called

239
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:37,720
me.
This is the fucking fighting cock

240
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,500
suckers.
Holy Shit.

241
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,270
Eddie Alvarez.
She says,

242
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,500
I gotta manage it.
Attack.

243
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,560
He looks fantastic.
That's what I'm fucking talking about.

244
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,880
So I say,
Joe,

245
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:48,650
I say to him,
Joey,

246
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,290
how'd you get into podcasts?
And his response,

247
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,120
you know Chael Sonnen,
he wanted me to jail.

248
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,710
It was always,
you know what is calls me Joe Rogan.

249
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,630
I'm mugged a hooker down in New Jersey
and senator Lee said her wig on fire.

250
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,301
It's like,
okay,

251
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,950
we got to.
There's two moving parts here.

252
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:06,790
First off,
that is,

253
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,400
I don't know how that answers my
question of how,

254
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,420
but now I need to know the story here.
So he ties it all together with.

255
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,380
He went on something,
just something.

256
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,330
He got an appearance.
He told the story of Mug and a hooker in

257
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:22,790
New Jersey and setting her wig on fire
and all of a sudden he blew up overnight

258
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,201
and he goes,
yeah.

259
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,860
I realized people like the stores.
I never knew that I had stories from the

260
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:29,020
part of the country I'm in and the
neighborhood I grew up in.

261
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:30,580
I thought everybody had these doors.
He's like,

262
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:32,310
chill center,
and I thought I'd tell you I mogul

263
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,420
hooker and lighter,
wiggling fire.

264
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,911
You Go,
yeah,

265
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,310
well I'm moved 10 hookers and let 10
wigs on fire.

266
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,110
I was like,
I didn't know I had stories.

267
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,410
Well in that way it's a swap meet in
Jersey.

268
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:44,700
They called,
what do they call the market?

269
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,640
Something like that.
I was a kid.

270
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,830
I used to go to where the use to do the
bicycles,

271
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:54,160
whatever those street car races and next
door to it.

272
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:59,110
They had what was called and you'd go
there and they had pretty much shit that

273
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,230
was stolen.
It was just a festival and they tries to

274
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,950
a table fee because everything was 50
percent off.

275
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,270
Even the sneakers I remember and then we
found that that the guy would go to the

276
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,110
fucking factory and jump over the fence
and take over

277
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,080
the sneakers,
no mistakes,

278
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,410
so the irregulars he,
they would take those and just sell them

279
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:28,210
at those markets.
Swap meets and then we find that we cut

280
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:29,640
into his action.
I just want it gone.

281
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,520
We,
we,

282
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,190
we cut into that action and the MANACA
action,

283
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,250
they're not going to.
Those tubes have been knocked.

284
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,960
Best Prank.
They would throw thousands of them out

285
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:39,700
with little things like the chemical was
off.

286
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,750
You start blinking too much,
like the chemical.

287
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,040
Then it was pepper spray,
pepper spray,

288
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,320
like people would spray and you can see
what happened.

289
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,870
It's not regular binocular.
What does that tear gas.

290
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:54,420
It was like the tickets.

291
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,510
The Spanish kid that was advertised and
we make them jump the fence and we'd

292
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:06,250
have thousands of tubes a and we'd sell
them for fifty cents a piece on Monday,

293
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:09,760
the sixth and seventh grade or virus,
but there was always three kids that

294
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,140
complain.
There was like the chemical imbalances

295
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,460
or
facebook friends with me from high

296
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:22,840
school and Pussy wouldn't get wet.
He used to call the dry hump,

297
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,940
the jersey,
they used to call her insurance.

298
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,390
Either
said she had some type of Vd,

299
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:38,590
so they called the lorry Jack.
She's got the Jack,

300
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,640
the Jack Jack.
Jack said he used to call her name and

301
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:49,300
Jack like that was like,
they just at this girl,

302
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,160
oh my God,
I got a score,

303
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,940
got coke,
she's got money.

304
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,310
I'm going to fuck her.
I'm excited.

305
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,360
We go back to a hotel.
We finally registered like $30.

306
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,390
They asked us through one of the Jacuzzi
in the room and shit.

307
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,630
It was one of those dirty hotels on
totally as you going to New York City.

308
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,210
We went in there,
we walked in and she goes,

309
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,550
rule number one,
you are not going to find me.

310
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,560
It's five in the morning.
That goes,

311
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:15,250
my fucking.
That goes this night and all of a sudden

312
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:15,951
she looks at me.
She goes,

313
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:18,230
well,
if you could guess the color of my

314
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:20,210
panties,
I fuck you.

315
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,770
I'm like,
okay,

316
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,360
read.
And she goes,

317
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,010
they're green,
but good enough.

318
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,580
We started snorting coke,
mass.

319
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,410
I mean it was filthy.
I woke up at five in the afternoon and

320
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:38,310
Doug flutie was thrown that quarterback
that down down 83.

321
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,150
I was waking up.
She was naked.

322
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:41,980
Rip Apart.

323
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,820
Fuck stretches.
Pain.

324
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:45,700
Now it's fucking is killer.
I mean,

325
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,150
music is so hard to pin down.
It's funny too because you know,

326
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,280
we had a bit of a.
We had a falling out recently and you

327
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,900
couldn't find a bigger stars will faint
to me.

328
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:58,630
I just listened to his record on the way
over here and it's a fucking

329
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:01,780
masterpiece,
but he also won't fucking talk to me

330
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:02,650
right now.
What happened?

331
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,190
Well,
here's the thing I don't even mind

332
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:06,910
talking about,
right?

333
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,140
I in an interview,
I said that he was,

334
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,650
and this is honestly what I believe,
I think he is.

335
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,570
And you're going to laugh when I say it,
but I swear this is what I fucking

336
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:22,390
believe.
I think he's a paid ass and

337
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,750
I'll just let that sink in for a second.
I think he's taken motherfuckers out

338
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,910
and they got this farm and they had
these horses.

339
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:36,290
There was over 100 hours of footage of
these people getting fucked by animals

340
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,970
and one guy,
they type it though.

341
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,280
There's a video of it.
You could watch it.

342
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:41,600
You want to see absolutely.

343
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,080
Look,
things go wrong all the time.

344
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:49,800
You can crawl up on the couch,
you can declare yourself a victim,

345
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:54,000
you can give up or you can recognize
that that's just part of life and wake

346
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:58,830
up the next day with a smile on your
face and continue to move forward and

347
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:01,560
just do your best.
I've told,

348
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,620
I've told the truth.
Uh,

349
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,140
I think it's really hard to do any
damage to somebody who's willing to tell

350
00:17:07,141 --> 00:17:09,420
the truth regardless of the
consequences.

351
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:13,620
And then I admit mistakes.
I think mistakes have a way of.

352
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,970
So compounding themselves just because
people don't acknowledge those mistakes.

353
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:22,971
So given this pitch,
all I want to do is just get in the

354
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:28,800
polls that determines who is in the
presidential debates.

355
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,040
I think that if I'm in the presidential
debates,

356
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,540
I have an opportunity of actually
winning because of

357
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,470
this

358
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,740
package that you've allowed me to
present here today ago.

359
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:41,350
Thank you.

360
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,900
That's why the bad girls club show is
the greatest single and TV that.

361
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,950
Oh,
put a brick up a trailer for it.

362
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,920
If you're listening is going to be good.

363
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,760
They just get.
They get like we talked about this piece

364
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,840
of garbage and then they just fucking
make them drink and stuff.

365
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:02,260
I'm going a goddamn house for three for
three months and it's,

366
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,070
it's they have to go to the hospital for
the fights fights they've had this year

367
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,770
particularly.
It goes,

368
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,530
I'm over there trying to twerk in.
This bitch is like,

369
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:14,940
you know,
she tried to work next to me.

370
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:18,920
She was right in my workspace and it's
like bitch can't talk like me.

371
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,690
You shouldn't even be on the same level.
And then it's like having fights like

372
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,250
adults face.
He goes,

373
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,810
bitch,
because you ain't on my work level.

374
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,700
That's why I'm up in your face because
you ain't on my work level.

375
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,950
Tom Cruise.
He like a traveling king,

376
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,390
you know,
like he's got many,

377
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:37,050
many trailers like and like so like you
know,

378
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:38,700
you arrive in a situation,
you think,

379
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,220
right.
Era,

380
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,460
my prejudices about Tom Cruise,
all the things I've read,

381
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:44,580
all the things I've heard go prejudice.
Like we meet him,

382
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,970
he blasted me.
We've searched affability and charm that

383
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:51,050
they melt it away.
Ice cones.

384
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,470
Then the pure heat of the man sweetness.
You gave a lock on the sofa.

385
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:56,880
It was my birthday.
During that film I got a big basket full

386
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:59,770
of blight,
yoga related things and stuff like that.

387
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:00,900
At least sort of for,
for president.

388
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,883
You remember,
you know,

389
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,420
shake your hand.
Remembers your name,

390
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:05,780
sort of remembers details about aids.
I could bring.

391
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,250
You mentioned you're on a or something
in that conversation.

392
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:10,820
Next conversation.
You mentioned that on a one man his ass

393
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,960
for 10 hours really,
really late because of that fucking

394
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:13,350
monkey.

395
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,930
Actually it was playing up like he was
not working that day.

396
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:17,500
I went back,
went mandy's affidavit,

397
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,750
said when he'd been married,
Katie Holmes,

398
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:20,880
and it was that little ms dot Tom
Cruise.

399
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,490
Siri Cruz was,
they're all lined up.

400
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:24,241
I went there.
I was very,

401
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:27,840
very late and they'd like they to wheat
and goes,

402
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:28,171
oh,
well,

403
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:29,910
do you want to stay away?
I mean,

404
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:30,300
yeah,
yeah.

405
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,060
I will wait and I had to sat.
I'm sat with you now.

406
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:36,990
Joe Opposite Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes
and the little dial in one.

407
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,550
I was fucking eating spaghetti and it's
as a complicated thing to eat.

408
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,250
He's long isn't it?

409
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,100
The lady and the tramp shoving that shit
in and then the next course I think was

410
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:50,050
the signer,
which was weird because that's to pass

411
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:51,990
the courses.
Then I think there was like sort of

412
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,110
cupcakes and stuff involved

413
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,150
all the way through.
It just sat opposite.

414
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:58,720
Tom Cruise talking about communism,
which I brought up as a topic,

415
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:00,610
which in retrospect was a mistake.
Why?

416
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,920
Well,
because don't bring up communism or let

417
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:04,750
me ask you this.
I've got to pop it in the spring.

418
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:06,150
Bottled water.
I just wanted to dig out Bro.

419
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,770
Guess how much.
Not Small enough for that.

420
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,690
Don't piss all over my floor in here.
Yeah,

421
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:13,930
you can do it in there.
Just just corn hole that we have to go

422
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:18,931
soon anyway because I to get something.
Me Put the Cameron Nearest Dick or were

423
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:22,450
the
first folks.

424
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:24,070
That's the first time anybody's peed on
the pocket.

425
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:27,170
Don't take a photo of his dick.
It's blocked by the cup.

426
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,190
If you guys taking a photo of your dick,
Bro,

427
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,550
that's a full Kombucha.
Definitely don't drink that.

428
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:36,030
You're going to piss in the pickles too,
bro.

429
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,860
How'd you cut off stream for sure.
You're dribbling on my carpet?

430
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,023
No,
I fully,

431
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,240
fully,
fully this cock.

432
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,520
Jamie pulled up to the fucking
definition.

433
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,130
Is this an urban dictionary?
This is a better definition,

434
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,420
I think that no one you gave.
Oh,

435
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:50,254
how dare you.
Hey,

436
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,250
demasculated millennial,
liberal male who often speaks of white

437
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:57,940
privilege and modern feminism,
blames white men for all of the world's

438
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:00,830
problems.
The new definition or.

439
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,760
I like this though.
There goes chat again with the megaphone

440
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,430
telling everyone that he's a Vegan.
What a cook.

441
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,230
Okay.
I like that.

442
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,480
Did you.
Do you

443
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,300
stay in any way in touch with those kids
from back in the day from the kids that

444
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:19,380
bullied you?
Did you ever.

445
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,360
It was actually funny after the ultimate
fighter,

446
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,390
um,
I got invited out by one of the guys,

447
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,040
um,
and uh,

448
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,140
just because I think a couple of people
will just,

449
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,870
yeah,
saw one of the guys who was one of the

450
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:35,070
main guys and he's like,
Hey,

451
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,790
I'm walking around downtown Fort Worth
and said,

452
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,020
why don't we go out here,
whatever.

453
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:40,561
I'm like,
all right,

454
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:41,394
I'll go.
And.

455
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,600
Well,
he had actually brought me into a Sushi

456
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:49,970
restaurant in all around the table was
most of the people that were not most is

457
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,520
probably only like eight or 10 people,
but they were some of the main kids that

458
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,320
were at that party when I dressed up and
everything.

459
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,563
Man,
if you,

460
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,940
if we'd have known you were a fighter or
could've kicked their butts and we

461
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:02,000
wouldn't have done that to you.
And I'm just like,

462
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,030
it's.
So I told him I was going to the

463
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,530
bathroom just left.
Um,

464
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,780
I think that's the only time I've ever
done anything like that,

465
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:08,140
but I'm just like,
I can't,

466
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:09,390
I can't be around these guys.

467
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,500
And I don't think we should talk about
trump for a long time,

468
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:14,000
but.
But that's,

469
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,240
he's got a lot of charisma.
Say what you want to love the guy.

470
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:19,170
He's got a ton of charisma and that's
weird.

471
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,450
Kind of charisma.
Yeah.

472
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,410
He's got like this mean guy charisma.
You want him to like you.

473
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,140
So you say things like you don't even
believe.

474
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:29,120
Yeah.
Because you want him to like think that

475
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:31,280
you're on his side so we won't come
after you.

476
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,570
Yeah.
That's a bully charisma.

477
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,930
That's absolutely right.
But it's charisma nonetheless.

478
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,660
That's the.
And that's the thing about stars and

479
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:42,830
movie stars and stuff like that.
It's like you're watching this guy,

480
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,880
you watch denzel Washington waiting for
him to snap.

481
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,420
He never does.
But your weight,

482
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:53,270
you can tell he's Gunna,
he just doesn't.

483
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,550
It's like Robert Downey Jr.
I feel like with robert downey jr.

484
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,920
You're watchIng a guy not do cocaine.

485
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,540
Yeah.
He wants to do everything in him,

486
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:07,100
wants to do cocaine.
So you're watching a guy not actively,

487
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:12,101
not do cocaine from second to second.
That's such a good analysis.

488
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,200
Yeah.
That you're just trying.

489
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,370
You're just watching this guy,
this thing,

490
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:19,640
this car accident that never happens.
I know somebody to talk to a cop and

491
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:23,870
they said that when he started working
and then 11 years later.

492
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,220
Oh yeah.
Going into those areas where these

493
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:31,520
things always happen and after years and
years it just,

494
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,240
it just wears on you for sure.
Know from the aiR.

495
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,490
This is me growing up in situations,
you know what I mean?

496
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,100
I wouldn't want to go back.
I barely go back there,

497
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,450
you know,
so.

498
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,780
But it Do give you nerves.
You'll nerves heightened in naturally

499
00:23:44,781 --> 00:23:45,470
kicks.
Oh,

500
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,720
100 percent,
you know,

501
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:47,750
and like,
yeah,

502
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,220
some people can't handle those nerves.
You learn how to breathe quietly.

503
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,160
You don't know like somebody,
you could walk down the street and

504
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:59,160
somebody could pull a pistol out on
those things though.

505
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,690
I've been driving down the street with
my ex lady and she was talking and I was

506
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,420
like,
get down because I saw a guy draw on a

507
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:09,920
corner and shoot across the street at
another guy that's the gun went up.

508
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,260
We drove under the,
the,

509
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,750
the,
the fire.

510
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:15,920
Right.
But it was long,

511
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,480
it was long.
Oh my god.

512
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,920
And then they went up,
we went under the second shot off and I

513
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:23,330
drove and I was like,
man,

514
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:24,830
that was crazy.
Like I'm that guy.

515
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,560
She laid it out,
we made that was crazy.

516
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,030
And she was like,
you didn't call the police.

517
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:29,531
And I was like,
well,

518
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:32,600
what is he like to tell what happened?
And I was like,

519
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,310
I don't want to be.
And that's how crazy it is that you

520
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:40,440
don't even want to be involved because
you got to go to the cops and I end up

521
00:24:40,441 --> 00:24:44,330
calling the police and um,
things like he described the victim.

522
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:45,830
I was like,
white t shirt,

523
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:48,070
blue Jeans,
that's all I said.

524
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,610
And that it was like,
was he black?

525
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,700
And it was just a long pause.
It was a long poles and they like sarah

526
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:57,020
is he black?
And I was like,

527
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:57,981
man,
you know,

528
00:24:57,981 --> 00:24:58,814
that nick was black

529
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,390
men do that all.
I have several of those in my own,

530
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,060
not nuclear family but my family of
procreation.

531
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,710
So might fruit.
I won't saY who,

532
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,850
but brutal.
Right.

533
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,180
And,
and here's another thing that you never

534
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:18,090
admit that you're wrong,
right,

535
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,300
because admitting that you're wrong
makes you lose face.

536
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,080
And that's such a detrimental dynamic to
have,

537
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:25,920
right?
I mean,

538
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,230
you know,
I might come home at night and um,

539
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,280
I've had a tough day and I might respond
correctly to my dog.

540
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,390
I actually will go back and then hug my
dog because I have enough self awareness

541
00:25:36,391 --> 00:25:38,760
to realize that I didn't give her enough
attention.

542
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:40,980
Right?
So I have enough humilitY to,

543
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,390
nevermind,
you know,

544
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:44,610
another human.
My dog is just as important to me.

545
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:47,160
And if I responded curtly,
I will sort of apologized to Her.

546
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,450
Yet I've got family members,
uh,

547
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,740
again,
this is not my family of my wife or

548
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:55,620
kids,
but the family that I was born into that

549
00:25:55,621 --> 00:26:00,360
have never apologized about anything
because they come from a cultural

550
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:03,780
landscape where to apologize to your
child,

551
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:07,440
to somebody younger is to lose face at
parent is always right.

552
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,200
And I mean that might work when you're
too,

553
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,680
but when you're both now adults,
I think you sort of have to get out of

554
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:16,350
that and realized that we all make
mistakes and we all have to own up to

555
00:26:16,351 --> 00:26:18,540
them.
Like I want to see me get beat the fuck

556
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:19,980
up.
Just jamie.

557
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,780
Jamie shown a video of me about to get
my ass kicked by nick diaz

558
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,050
are you get destroyed really fast.
I would imagine if the game is

559
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:31,140
realistic,
fill it up and I get fucked up.

560
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:34,620
People want to say it.
But they might have used the ceo's

561
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,970
secret character.
They might have.

562
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:39,000
You got some bullshit skills.
Might have you juiced up.

563
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,590
I got it.
Doesn't matter.

564
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:43,470
I got some bullshit with.
Let's hear mike because you know I'm

565
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:45,630
super casual fan.
So my commentary.

566
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,370
No.
Rather with the leg kick.

567
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,850
I've never heard this before.
Oh.

568
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,900
Oh,
we're all good with the leg kicks.

569
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,820
Rogan get kicked in the face.
Oh good.

570
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,250
With the kicks.
Diaz is back it up.

571
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,250
Rogan missed.
oh really?

572
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,270
Kicked in the chest.
Tattoos.

573
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,800
Accurate.
Look at that.

574
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,730
And a lot of scientology training in
terms of what it imparts to people is a

575
00:27:07,871 --> 00:27:10,170
quality of being,
direct,

576
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,790
being assertive,
being confident,

577
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:14,730
being in charge,
and being okay with sort of dominating

578
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:18,240
the situations that you're in.
It'S one of the reasons that I think it

579
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:21,030
appeals a lot to act as because it,
it,

580
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:22,981
it,
it works,

581
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:25,920
I think for people who have any sort of
insecurity or who are going into

582
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:30,921
situations of uncertainty and it allows
you to almost reprogrammed your circuits

583
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:36,681
in some way and be okay about using
assertive body language and speech and

584
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:42,240
it also imparts a sense that you have
all the truett's necessary to save

585
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:45,120
humanity from itself.
Not just humanity on earth,

586
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:50,121
but throughout time and space,
and it is your obligation to ensure that

587
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:53,190
those truths are saved,
saved for posterity,

588
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:58,050
and communicated as widely as possible
in a totally unadulterated fashion

589
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:02,850
because any adulteration of the message
means that not only do they not work,

590
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,270
they become toxic and dangerous.
Is it good?

591
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:05,540
Good.

592
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,640
I like it.
Let me try something that give it a go.

593
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,280
What do you do with it?
Take a little bump.

594
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:14,210
Put it under your lip bump.
Little pinch cocaine style bump.

595
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,900
Now we've never done that either.
I'd go less and less asked.

596
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,610
Plenty for you.
Is that too much?

597
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:20,540
that's good.
Okay.

598
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:22,910
Where do you put it?
Anywhere you put any love you want,

599
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,710
it's start to burn a little cranky.
Cancer or immediately?

600
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:31,940
I don't think so.
I mean now you shouldn't.

601
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,420
I get messages every day from people
that lost 100 pounds.

602
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,560
Right?
Feeling healthy.

603
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,520
The problem is we're dealing with
propaganda and you can do one or two

604
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:42,380
things.
You could either just say,

605
00:28:42,381 --> 00:28:43,580
well,
you know,

606
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:46,280
this is this.
I think I swallowed all that tobacco.

607
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,953
Yeah.
It's all gone.

608
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,260
Yeah.
I was wondering why I'm so hard.

609
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,390
You got to to on it.
It's gone.

610
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,110
I have it swallowed up.
I had a boy.

611
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,190
I don't know what I'm doing.

612
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,310
Alright.
Julian,

613
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,470
drink and swat,
right?

614
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,640
Something like that.
Like chris brown,

615
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:10,550
like fuck is under age cousin and then
piss on somebody.

616
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,110
No,
those are kelly.

617
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,870
You could fit like three different black
people.

618
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,170
I don't know who.
Fuck their cousin kelly was peeing on

619
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:19,730
people.
Didn't.

620
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,070
He used to put this lately and molest
them.

621
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,150
No,
that's the other guy.

622
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,590
That's bill cosby.
Oh,

623
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,030
got it.
Jesus christ and that crazy.

624
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,890
Like,
what the fuck man,

625
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,700
I can't tell black people are just
realized that you confused r kelly and

626
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:40,390
chris brown.
Is That bad when they.

627
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,710
They're off by like

628
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,600
15,
20 years.

629
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,600
What if one of them is our age?
Our kelly is,

630
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:51,170
is,
is,

631
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,920
is he's 49.
And when did he play basketball?

632
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,160
He didn't play basketball.
He's a singer,

633
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,460
a singer.
Got it.

634
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:02,490
He sets up like the really cheesy
anchors to ask him stupid questions

635
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,211
like,
did you?

636
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:05,710
Oh,
you had someone to do the bird is fat

637
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:07,740
thing.
That was the best one because you know,

638
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:09,580
if you ever.
Sometimes when you go,

639
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,803
hey,
um,

640
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,300
you know,
asked me about farts or something,

641
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,770
they'll be like,
like,

642
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,630
so they,
they know not to,

643
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:17,700
they,
they,

644
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,850
they check themselves on asking
something provocative or that's not 100

645
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:24,670
percent pg.
So I didn't know how it go,

646
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:25,540
but I go,
oh,

647
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,610
ask me my birth.
So fat and the lady goes,

648
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,470
okay.
And then.

649
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:32,470
So we just are in the middle of this
interview

650
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,770
and she goes,
white bird,

651
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:37,840
so fat and I was like,
a good question and I'm like,

652
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:39,520
I just rolled with it,
you know,

653
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,490
and then it grew.
And then a hot dog eating champion,

654
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:46,240
a guY that was in scotland,
she placed tinny place.

655
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,650
Yeah.
He's like one of The,

656
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,130
he was like a super competitive eater,
like a kobiashi dude.

657
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,510
This guy was assigned.
You play the audio on this.

658
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,010
It's incredible

659
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,820
life changing stuff.
Uh,

660
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,010
um,
dropped about 100 pounds in eight

661
00:31:01,011 --> 00:31:04,430
months.
He dropped 100 pounds my cheat day for

662
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:08,420
the year,
but prepping just this amazing water

663
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,530
drive.
Two giant inspirations.

664
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,690
First my wife second anniversary today.
So I want to say hi to her.

665
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,600
And um,
there's a comedian I love.

666
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:19,670
He's a big,
giant fat guy just like me,

667
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:20,504
bert chrysler,

668
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,540
he's still way bigger than I am.
MaYbe this fire him now explain that.

669
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,910
Why do you think they did that?
Do you think they did that?

670
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:35,490
Because if they overturn your case,
if they can somehow or another because

671
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,120
they don't want to check.
But is that it or is that discrediting

672
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:42,880
you in like that was a gigantic hit
movie.

673
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,640
But if they decide,
if they can discredit you,

674
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,210
it makes that movie still valuable.
Not only that,

675
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,670
it stops me from running for president
donut.

676
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,400
If they can discredit me.
Do you want to run for president?

677
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,130
I thought about it.
Even living in Mexico from Mexico would

678
00:31:58,131 --> 00:32:01,180
have had to forsake of that.
That's why I didn't do it.

679
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,591
The,
no,

680
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:04,690
the uh,
the reason why you didn't run for

681
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:07,210
president because you would have to have
forsaken live in New Mexico.

682
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,720
Now I might fucking when I know.

683
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,950
I figured I could have one.
No.

684
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:15,340
The libertarians contacted me twice to
come to their convention.

685
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:17,810
They wanted to nominate jesse.
Come back to America.

686
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,640
Com.
Ken and I chose not to do it because I

687
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:24,570
was up for the campaigning.
I was up to taking on,

688
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,910
taking on the damage and repubs.
But at this point,

689
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:31,480
at age 65,
I wash up to do the job for four years

690
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:36,520
where I'd have to end my lifestyle and
Mexico because people don't realize when

691
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,590
you take,
when you get one of them jobs like

692
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:42,560
president or governor,
your freedom leaves that day.

693
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:46,430
You don't have freedom.
We're pressured in to get this money.

694
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,670
Then why aren't we making fucking more?
Why eric?

695
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:55,390
Am I a bartender in addition to a
paleontologist in addition to somebody

696
00:32:55,761 --> 00:33:00,170
that's on tv,
if I'm making all this big pharma or big

697
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:03,020
paleo fucking money,
if I'm such a shill.

698
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,100
Okay.
Yeah.

699
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,280
Is that why I'm a month behind on my car
payment right now?

700
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,010
Is that why I'm trying to scrape
together rent?

701
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,550
Fuck.
You can aggressive.

702
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,680
Very aggressive.
These guys.

703
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:19,990
Prestige or fame and attention.
There's the bandwagon effect and crowd

704
00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:22,520
behavior.
And then there are people and entities.

705
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,151
Wait,
but wait,

706
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:23,451
wait,
wait,

707
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:24,290
wait,
wait.

708
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:29,180
The bandwagon effect and the and crowd
behavior like flat earth bullshit.

709
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,050
Okay.
We're only seven minutes and 53 seconds

710
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:34,810
into a 29 minute video.
Fuck.

711
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,190
But I have a feeling.
I mean,

712
00:33:38,191 --> 00:33:39,450
I don't,
I don't know for sure,

713
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:43,110
but my guess would be that if you wanted
to find people who said,

714
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:44,610
yeah,
trump grabbed my pussy,

715
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:48,230
it wouldn't be that fucking hard.
It's not like you're looking for bigfoot

716
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,210
pretty easy to have them be my guess.
Right.

717
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,210
But so,
so it wasn't like a hard thing to do.

718
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,300
It's a bread crumb trail.
It very simple,

719
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:06,060
very easy.
And so it's like when you realize like

720
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:07,590
that,
then you start feeling this weird

721
00:34:07,591 --> 00:34:09,810
compassion for him and you're like,
my god.

722
00:34:09,811 --> 00:34:13,650
Even with all his like maliciousness and
like weird pervasiveness and stuff.

723
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,140
Ultimately he,
they,

724
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,500
he's like a fucking bowl.
They got put into a god damn ring with a

725
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:22,430
matador.
He's been doing this kind of bull

726
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:26,250
fighting for like 30 fucking years for
better or for worse.

727
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,300
And he's,
we're watching what we saw last night I

728
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,040
guess.

729
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,080
And what's interesting about it,
a big part of what's interesting about

730
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:39,081
it is he came really close to women.
I mean he's still in the neighborhood of

731
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:44,391
winning plus or minus 11 points or would
that means is between now and how many

732
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:47,340
days do we have until the election is 21
days.

733
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,910
Listen man,
lot of crazy shit can happen in 21 days

734
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,630
to shift people's opinions,
but apparently again from all those

735
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:57,480
stats now look man,
I tried to get.

736
00:34:57,481 --> 00:34:59,820
I tried to say any of that stuff because
you don't even know if it's true.

737
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:04,050
They're all just talking on tv and they
brainwash and all of us to let us think

738
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:08,340
that they know who the is voting.
I don't know if she knows how to be just

739
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:09,540
herself.
That's a good point.

740
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,390
I mean I.
My problem with hillary is,

741
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,110
is purely an operational one.

742
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,310
I know that if I had handled,
I mean even in the conservative way,

743
00:35:17,311 --> 00:35:20,370
if you look at what she did with the
email server and her colleagues or

744
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:23,040
cohorts did and you say,
okay,

745
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:23,874
it's,
it's,

746
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,650
you know,
in a conservative way.

747
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:29,040
I'm looking at at how bad it was.
If I had done that,

748
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:34,100
I would have been sent to prison and I
know because we had various counter

749
00:35:34,351 --> 00:35:38,430
intelligence operations and alto,
you're trying to find the lake,

750
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:42,690
you're trying to find the problem and
you watch people get banged up for less

751
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:44,880
egregious acts and then what she's been
involved in.

752
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:48,390
So my problem with hillary is looking at
one set of rules for everybody.

753
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,290
The system is,
is broken in that respect,

754
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,480
but given the choices,
you know,

755
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:58,560
and when you have a choice between
someone who is for all her flaws,

756
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:04,930
been in the game for long enough to be
really well informed and capable of

757
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:07,760
compromise and capable of,
uh,

758
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,230
not just,
uh,

759
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,110
just
breaking

760
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:18,420
the entire machine and you have someone
who's just,

761
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:22,670
he could just kind of stepped off the
set of his reality tv show and then he

762
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,690
lied about everything and uh,
an elbowed his way onto your television

763
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:30,730
set and never left because,
you know,

764
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,290
cnn couldn't figure out how to give the
mic to someone else.

765
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,570
Um,
it's,

766
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:37,770
uh,
it's amazing.

767
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,320
Well,
he's a product of attention because they

768
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:43,020
realize that there's a heated race
right?

769
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:45,450
The heated race,
this guy was really famous and in a

770
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:48,180
heated race,
this guy would say some crazy stuff and

771
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:50,700
so they would tune into them so
everybody had to do an intro.

772
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,120
So because of him saying crazy stuff,
he accelerated the amount they were

773
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:56,520
talking about them.
so they're constantly talking about him

774
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,680
and barely talking about other people
and.

775
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:03,030
But he's created a warm hOle in our
political process now where there's

776
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,720
nothing so crazy that could disqualify
him among the people who liked him to so

777
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:12,810
he can just keep it just like nuclear
bombs of craziness that the press can't

778
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,900
ignore that the every time they think,
okay,

779
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,420
this is the crazy thing.
He said it's Going to harm his

780
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:21,190
candidacy,
so let's shine a light on it.

781
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,500
It just helps him,
you know,

782
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,430
he could just,
he could,

783
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,200
he could,
he could get on twitter right now and

784
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:27,210
say,
you know who I'd like to fuck,

785
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,320
I'd like to fuck nikki minaj and,
and it would work for him.

786
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,640
It was work for them.
You would see or use a tweet storm of a

787
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:40,970
billion people who say,
I'd like to fuck nikki minaj to go get

788
00:37:40,971 --> 00:37:43,910
her,
and it's insanity.

789
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,900
That's where we are.

790
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,970
When people said that was a trump
supporter,

791
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,770
what they meant was they may have only
seen part of what I was talking about.

792
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,980
I was writing about his skill as a
persuader and what I mean is that I

793
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:03,210
noticed in him the skills that I've
developed over decades for persuasion,

794
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,330
but at a higher level than I've ever
seen.

795
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,690
Meaning that he is the most persuasive
living human I've ever experienced.

796
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,600
yeah.
It looks like trump kind of kicked her

797
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:20,950
ass to.
It's pretty fucking weird.

798
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,900
Let's.
It's two 60,

799
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,470
four to 2:15 right now.
Is this phil?

800
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:31,070
We are an old trump.
This weird.

801
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:36,770
I feel like down because won
the crowd one weird on us.

802
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,623
Responsible

803
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,650
such a beautiful night.
That was probably the most fun I've ever

804
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:47,940
had on a podcast.
I keep.

805
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,670
I've said that before because I had
some.

806
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,930
We've had some fun ones together.
Oh yeah,

807
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,290
but that one might have topped it off.
I don't think I've ever laughed any

808
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,330
harder,
like burr had me laughing.

809
00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:58,630
Harder than.
I mean,

810
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,300
just as hard as you can.
Laugh

811
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,800
at the end of it at 1:30 in the morning,
trump tweets him at 1:30 in the morning.

812
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,520
Little jon stewart is a pussy
and would be hopeless in a debate with

813
00:39:10,521 --> 00:39:11,690
me.
I wouldn't even do that.

814
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,300
I'm going to.
I'll be the dude.

815
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:16,520
That means he was walking around talking
to himself.

816
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:21,110
They do brief dumb for the next
presidential thing and he goes,

817
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,580
all right,
I will see you later.

818
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,600
And he closed the door.
He's walking around his gold toed socks

819
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,040
hotel room.
I could go up and say,

820
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,390
I'm a fucking asshole.
Let me stop.

821
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,470
He had probably some woman there,
guy Donald Trump.

822
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:39,010
Go on the internet.
Want this shit.

823
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,340
I had taken this shit.
Fucking liberal media fucking tweaking

824
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:44,174
this thing out.
There

825
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,360
it all down.
I think we just violated the new laws.

826
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,320
This is like that hillary commercial
where they had the little kids watching

827
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:55,720
politics.
Bullshit.

828
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:57,220
Little kids.
Don't watch politics.

829
00:39:57,221 --> 00:40:00,130
There you go.
It's all about the future.

830
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,780
Comfortable with this.
You're not comfortable with lower doing

831
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,780
trump.
Trump's winning New Hampshire.

832
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:15,790
Hillary's winning Virginia really?
And as a little kid here,

833
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,730
he decided it was good idea.
I think that's totally illegal,

834
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:24,210
right?
Like you didn't have a fucking baby

835
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,260
while people are talking about eating
fake pussies.

836
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:34,860
That was before I didn't,
but if the kid was in the club,

837
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,053
we shut up.

838
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,133
Sure.

839
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,780
By the way,
through the elc spend.

840
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,680
Delicious.
Thank you.

841
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,360
I made this american chopped suey with
it and my wife gave a fucking bad review

842
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,850
before anybody even tasted it and
everybody just said,

843
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:50,900
fuck it.
Like she goes,

844
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:54,410
it looks like hamburger helper.
I've been shouting it for like four

845
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:56,470
days.
I got a respect for that fucking else

846
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,181
that you shot.
It's like,

847
00:40:57,181 --> 00:41:00,020
I'm eating all this shit.
I don't care if it's fucking bed.

848
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,490
Does it make you more aggressive?
what?

849
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,280
No,
joe,

850
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:10,281
you fucking lunatic.
Somebody gets in my face.

851
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:15,130
That might cost me to get more.
Lunatic.

852
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,640
Ate a little bit of protein.
You had to beat the fuck out of people

853
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:21,950
for like three decades before you could
like chill.

854
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,090
Smoke a little weed,
put on your little rascals hat and just

855
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:26,490
fucking

856
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,950
chill out.
Can

857
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,950
I say that?
Have you heard that study about like,

858
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,100
you know how they tried to figure

859
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,950
out like if everybody.
They always say liKe anybody can be

860
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:38,630
president of the United States,
right?

861
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:41,480
Like anybody,
everybody in America has the same

862
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:44,780
opportunities,
but what they've found is that some

863
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:49,670
people have one opportunity and other
people have many opportunities and

864
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:50,810
that's the difference.

865
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,050
So are you saying the world is unfair?

866
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,810
No,
but you were saying

867
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:07,710
it would have been a mark.
Like is a weT dream.

868
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,280
I'd molesters most of.
I remember watching the kid get molested

869
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,910
one time.
Oh no.

870
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,170
Not,
not like molested,

871
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:17,660
but like it was definitely an assault.
Boom.

872
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,050
And we're live.
Let's go check champ.

873
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,820
Let's go jam.
If you said anything else other than

874
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:25,000
let's go champions.
The first thing you said in the podcast

875
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,750
will be a giant.
We had to start it off.

876
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,750
Right?
The in the candidate,

877
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,800
by the way.
Pleasure meeting you finally.

878
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,090
Youtube as well,
champ.

879
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:36,620
Let's go champ.
I appreciate this.

880
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,810
So much positivity is happening right
now,

881
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:40,040
champ.
All around the world,

882
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,400
people saying,
let's go champ.

883
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,980
Yeah,
I couldn't imagine a champ.

884
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:45,440
I was.
I'm wanting to commit suicide and now

885
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,670
I'm walking.
Everywhere I go,

886
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:50,420
people are going to
miss this.

887
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,760
This is a sign that I'm back.
You're back.

888
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:55,670
I'm back chat.
Let's go chat.

889
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:59,470
Thank you everybody.
That was beautiful that you can share.

890
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:04,690
So I didn't expect any support from my,
from my colleagues and.

891
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,880
And it isn't that I don't care if I got
it,

892
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:10,070
but it's,
it's in some sense it's irrelevant.

893
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:15,290
It's irrelevant to me because my goal
was.

894
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:21,260
I'm not saying those god damn pronouns
and the reason I'm not saying them is

895
00:43:21,261 --> 00:43:26,060
because they're made up by left wing
ideologues and I don't like left wing

896
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:31,061
ideology ideology period.
And I know where corruption of speech

897
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,090
leads and I'm not goIng there.
So let's just talk about what happened.

898
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:38,400
You

899
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,400
tested positive for some
estrogen inhibitors as blockers

900
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,880
yesterday,
and blockers that a lot of people

901
00:43:47,881 --> 00:43:50,910
associate with people who take steroids.
We're talking about john.

902
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:55,860
This whole thing is going out with john
based on a test that took place on June

903
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,960
16th.
The reason that relevant when I went

904
00:43:57,961 --> 00:44:00,930
through my thing,
I was know he tested positive for

905
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,920
semester.
Jim blockers,

906
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,200
those don't really have anything to do
with anything.

907
00:44:04,201 --> 00:44:08,160
They don't help you that they're silly.
I think you might've just revealed

908
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:11,000
something.
He tested positive for two estrogen.

909
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,900
Yeah,
but no one else knew that.

910
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:16,590
There you go.
I'm revealing broke personal

911
00:44:16,591 --> 00:44:18,390
information.
That's what we're doing here though.

912
00:44:18,391 --> 00:44:18,931
Right?
Wow.

913
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:21,390
But thIs is like,
this is like the only way that anybody

914
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:23,100
could find that out is if you talked
about it.

915
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,110
Boom.
It's out there.

916
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:26,250
Right.
And that we're doing here,

917
00:44:26,251 --> 00:44:27,300
aren't we?
Creating some news.

918
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,690
It's a big news day basically.
What did you take?

919
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,010
So took a.
I took

920
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,580
an off offbrand cialis pill off brand.
It was,

921
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:38,460
it wasn't actual cialis,
but it was described to me as being a

922
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:40,740
cialis and so I thought it was a cialis
and I.

923
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,330
I just took it and jlp son and leaked
the information during my last podcast.

924
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:49,450
So It's out of it's shell has leaked out
information.

925
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,050
It could be.
Is it what he said to me out there?

926
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:53,700
They had no,
nothing.

927
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:57,210
I didn't hear anybody talking about,
honestly,

928
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:59,100
I'm in a weird position because I don't
think you're supposed to.

929
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:01,590
I don't think he supposed to.
Anybody's supposed to be talking about

930
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,040
the medical results until like it gets
released.

931
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:06,870
I don't know how it works.
I really don't.

932
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,500
I'm going to plead ignorance,
right?

933
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,360
I'll plead ignorance all day.
He might own name.

934
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,380
I think he probably took boner pills
because that's.

935
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,820
They have all that shit in them.

936
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,290
You know,
like they have potent pills,

937
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,910
have steroids in them always hitting.
Right.

938
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:23,280
Because I just found that at joe's gas
station over here,

939
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:28,110
it has like the best I've never seen
these right on is known for his love of

940
00:45:28,111 --> 00:45:30,210
the boner pill.
He means what you would call a boner

941
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:34,140
pill contour.
He's actually read blogs about boner

942
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:37,440
pills and directed me to reviews of
boner pills.

943
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,280
Terrified.
But I mean these things have steroids in

944
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:42,750
them.
They have a bunch of stuff and if you

945
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,540
party wasn't the last thing he got
busted for cocaine or something.

946
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,150
If you bus,
if you do cocaine,

947
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,970
lot of guys take these because you can
get hard off of having cocaine and so if

948
00:45:50,971 --> 00:45:54,090
he takes boner pills then he's going to
be tempered a little too much.

949
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:58,310
Speculation for respect.
No,

950
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,540
I didn't think I got lucky.
I thought that you failed drug tests

951
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:01,920
when you're doing sketchy shit.
Right?

952
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:04,590
But didn't you think there might be some
sketchy shit and some chinese?

953
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,910
No.
Station rhino.

954
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:07,060
Dick pill.
I,

955
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,060
I,
um,

956
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,990
what you know about the rhinos.
My friend ryan,

957
00:46:09,991 --> 00:46:11,940
my friend brian called it,
he was on the,

958
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:13,650
on the podcast.
He said,

959
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,970
you know,
john likes to party.

960
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:16,970
I Bet he took one of them dick pills.
um,

961
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,073
no.
Um,

962
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,610
that's funny you called it.
Yeah.

963
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,630
Well he,
he was,

964
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:22,230
