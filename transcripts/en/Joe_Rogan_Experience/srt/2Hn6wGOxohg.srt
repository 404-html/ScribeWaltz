1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,900
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,790
two,
one.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,733
Boom.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,220
The Lost Art of knifemaking.
It's still alive.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,990
How are you man?
I'm doing good man.

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,520
I coming down here.
I appreciate it.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,130
Huge.
I really appreciate you having me down.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,230
Hey listen man,
you've made two awesome.

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,730
Well for awesome.
Nice for me.

10
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:24,860
But this one is one I use all the time
that uh,

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,570
I've posted on instagram.
The people freak out as we were talking

12
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:29,820
about before the podcast said it
actually has meteor in it.

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,751
Yeah.
Media,

14
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:32,610
right?
What's meteor is a big one.

15
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,410
Media writes a little one.
Is that the idea?

16
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,450
Do you know?
I guess

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,060
she had the knife maker

18
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,490
so I didn't actually make,
so I made the knife,

19
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:44,450
I forged the knife.
But the steel is,

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,130
is a very special kind of steel that
very few people can actually

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,160
manufacturer on a small scale in the
world.

22
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,950
And that was made by my shop made
Petersburg.

23
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,760
And so,
um,

24
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,470
the meteorite is kind of a,
a small element in the whole matrix

25
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:06,901
because most media,
right is all nickel or all iron or

26
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:10,240
something like that.
And this one particularly is a lot of

27
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:14,050
nickel and some cobalt.
And if you're going to make it an actual

28
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:17,920
usable steel out of it,
you can't really use a whole lot of it

29
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,080
in the overall mixture.

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,790
Hmm.
So is there any media rights that are

31
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,500
made at all iron?
Yeah,

32
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,450
definitely.
You just have to find them.

33
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,860
You just got to find the ones.
Yeah.

34
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:30,110
And they're their impact sites all over
the world.

35
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,910
Like they're hitting the world all the
time.

36
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,350
How does it,
where is it?

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,140
Can you just take them like when they
land,

38
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,310
is it yours?
If you find it,

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,650
you don't have to report it to NASA or
anything,

40
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:40,520
right?
No.

41
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,620
Hey Bro,
found some space junk.

42
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,160
Most of them are,
are so small that they,

43
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:49,120
by the time they hit the actual earth
surface,

44
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,760
they've completely disintegrated or
burned up.

45
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,120
So it's the really massive ones.
And this was part of a impact,

46
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,190
I think in South America.

47
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,180
Oh Wow.
I can't remember where he's like,

48
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,330
it's just crazy to think that this is a
piece of space in there.

49
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,330
Fuck.
Yandian this dope pattern.

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,730
Um,
I'm really into crafts from Shit,

51
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,050
man.
I always have been.

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,080
I love handmade pool cues and this desk,
which is a handmade desk and I feel like

53
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:22,700
it's one of the things that are really
appreciate in this modern digital world.

54
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,410
And I also feel like unfortunately it
may be one of the things that's slipping

55
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:28,244
away.

56
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,530
It definitely is slipping away.
I think with,

57
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:32,820
um,
you know,

58
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:35,430
with technology,
technology has been great for us and a

59
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:38,390
lot of different ways.
Like we couldn't be fucking talking into

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,233
a piece of metal

61
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,570
recorded on the computer,
going through a wire flying through the

62
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:43,060
air.
Like it

63
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,000
does a lot of great things.
But in doing all those great things,

64
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,030
it actually has taken us away from
really creating and working with our

65
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:53,770
hands.
And so like,

66
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,610
you know,
even this whole like a farm to table

67
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,770
movement where people even growing their
vegetables.

68
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,090
Yeah,
you've got your own chickens.

69
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,560
They're,
they're laying eggs for you.

70
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,840
Like knowing where this stuff is coming
from,

71
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,600
handling,
like firsthand contact with that.

72
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,720
Um,
just having that relationship in general

73
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:15,721
with it brings so much more value to the
overall experience of eating those eggs

74
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:19,270
are using that knife or sitting at this
fucking table right here

75
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,530
and it seems like a fairly recent
movement in that direction.

76
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,290
Right?
Like it feels like things got so digital

77
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,160
that people are like,
whoa,

78
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:28,000
Whoa,
whoa.

79
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:31,410
What the facebook and the fucking
instagram I want to I,

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,280
you know,
I want a wood table,

81
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,350
I want to saw this.
I'm dating myself.

82
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,340
Yeah.
Your hands on it.

83
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,200
They,
I don't want it to meet pastor rick.

84
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,360
Yeah.
I want real stuff.

85
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,510
And there's something about handmade
things,

86
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:48,110
whether it's a handmade pair of boots
are handmade bag like this.

87
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,700
Like there's something about things that
are made by hand that people get at like

88
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:52,870
a deep appreciation of,

89
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,950
for sure.
For sure.

90
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,180
Well,
and I think it,

91
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,500
I think it also kind of goes back to,
like I was saying like as technology has

92
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:02,620
advanced,
we've kind of grown away from these

93
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:06,160
kinds of what's considered like blue
collar work and craftsmanship kind of

94
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:09,910
work.
But I think people really are driven by

95
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,600
a sense of achievement.
And when you're doing data entry that

96
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,080
literally millions of people fucking
monkeys can be trained to do,

97
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,140
not to like diminish anything that
anybody's doing but literally like it.

98
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,440
To be able to go into a craft and to and
had the hands on experience is very,

99
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:28,571
very,
very,

100
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,220
very different.
And that sense of achievement.

101
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,970
Even when somebody comes out of
something and maybe I taught a class on

102
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:35,860
how to make a knife and it looks like a
fucking Turd,

103
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,680
they're gonna think it looks like the
most beautiful fucking knife they've

104
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:42,270
ever seen in their life because their
hands and their creativity,

105
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,590
they've touched their energy,
their,

106
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:48,280
their sweat and pop.
Probably some of their blood is put into

107
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:50,730
creating that thing and that brings that
much more valuable.

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,410
Yeah,
I think that's an issue with people

109
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:55,290
today that have jobs that they don't
feel are very fulfilling is that there's

110
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,810
no real thing that they're creating at
the end.

111
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:01,740
Whereas like if you make a table at the
end when you were putting the final

112
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:04,350
sanding on the final,
you know,

113
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:08,400
a layer of,
of a stain and you're looking at it

114
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,960
like,
I fucking made this.

115
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:12,840
Like this is a real thing that I can
touch that I made.

116
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,530
Just like human beings in our current
form,

117
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,680
we have a,
there's a deep connection to making

118
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:21,500
things physical.
Things end up settling and,

119
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:21,971
and,
and,

120
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:24,060
uh,
an appreciation for things that people

121
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:25,260
have made.
Whether it's a,

122
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:28,220
a rifle that somebody made or a night
for a,

123
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,330
you know,
a hammer that's that someone's made.

124
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:35,100
There's something about that that we
just have a real appreciation for.

125
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:39,240
If you can buy us a knife from the store
that's made in a show,

126
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,230
I mean,
it will work,

127
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,870
you know,
some knife that's made some mass

128
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:45,090
manufacturing process.
It'll work and it's fine.

129
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,511
I mean,
you'll,

130
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,310
you'll appreciate it,
but you won't appreciate it.

131
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:48,840
Like,
I appreciate this thing.

132
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,830
Like every time I take this out and I'm
like super careful with it and you know,

133
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:56,850
and then the handle the handle's made
out of this is Moose antler and elk

134
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,980
right there,
right at the

135
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,670
top and the Moose of the bottom.
So,

136
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,020
and I saw your conversation or listen to
your conversation with Guy Ritchie and

137
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:05,570
you brought up that there was,
I think actually Jamie pulled it up and

138
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:10,490
he was like bogged oak and Guy Richie
was like boggo what bog or their

139
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:13,640
American bugs there.
I don't know if there are any American

140
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:16,340
box.
It was from a a bog in Russia and it was

141
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:19,390
carbon dated to 5,400 years old.
Jeez.

142
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,570
So essentially it's been sunken and Abog
and just other knife that you made for

143
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:26,220
me that has a handle it.
That's how did,

144
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,810
how's wanting to get ahold of Boggo?
So people are raising logs.

145
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,720
Like there actually was a show,
I think it was on discovery channel or

146
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:36,740
history where people were,
their job was raising logs out of the

147
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:39,440
ball,
the swamps down in Louisiana and the

148
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:43,540
south and using,
making use of that wood for tape of

149
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,050
projects and craft projects like this.

150
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,450
So that,
but that's happening all over the world.

151
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,890
And some of that stuff are these ancient
logs that you know,

152
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,940
it's the right conditions where the log,
the tree falls over.

153
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,650
It just sits there and steeps and that's
a big thing for the pool cue shafts,

154
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,720
Lakewood chaffs they like to take these
logs out of the bottom like Lake

155
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,860
Michigan or something,
right.

156
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,910
And then they dry it all out and then
they make shafts out of it.

157
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:14,750
And there's something about it being in
the bottom of the water for so long.

158
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,510
It does something to the,
to the way they feel.

159
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,321
Right.
What do you got there,

160
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,930
Jamie?
That's ancient bog would the artisan

161
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,440
dice.
Oh,

162
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,880
some dungeons and dragons nerd shit
right there.

163
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,620
Sonny super polished up though.
It looks cool.

164
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,760
Or those dungeons and dragon nerds.
Dinosaurs or dice all decided,

165
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,340
yeah,
sides on that.

166
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,870
Now what would,
that was only for a game,

167
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,440
right?
You wouldn't play tice dice.

168
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,720
Yeah.
They use it for all kinds of different,

169
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:43,550
they're actually like value holders for
the most part.

170
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,100
Value Holders.
What do you mean?

171
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,690
So like 16.
So the countdown with the Dyson,

172
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:50,720
so they have an actual place sitting
there that says 16,

173
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,501
15,
20,

174
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:52,370
whatever.
Oh,

175
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:56,600
you understand dungeons and dragons.
You might be a Dork sometimes I'm going

176
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:01,160
to go with a brother and my,
my brother in law is a magic,

177
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:02,360
the gathering.
Oh,

178
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:05,000
that and per dork.
That's where people that get kicked out

179
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,460
of the dungeons and dragons.
It's,

180
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,100
it's,
it's,

181
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,770
it's just a different iteration of chest
really.

182
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:11,930
I mean it's just,
it's all strategy is definitely not

183
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:13,460
that.
What is this?

184
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,900
Oh,
that's reusable handle,

185
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,830
you know,
all bearing made that kids in Montana.

186
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,000
Really good guy.

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,920
He's a nice kid.
I met him a couple of years ago and uh,

188
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:25,610
in Eugene actually they do a knife show
there.

189
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,260
Every image that you just showed Jamie,
that's bogged oak that some other like

190
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,750
big chunks of it that they pulled out.
Wow.

191
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,050
Interesting.
So there must be a community of view

192
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:36,920
people,
these,

193
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,200
these knifemaking people.
Yeah.

194
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:41,600
There,
there are quite a few people who have

195
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:44,050
started getting into the knife making
um,

196
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,750
the knife making,
um,

197
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,650
the world,
the moral of the knife making a really

198
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:53,651
there the resurgence of kind of
handcrafted hand forge knives kind of

199
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:56,400
started back in the um,

200
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,420
and it was,
it stemmed off from um,

201
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,920
I think it was a custom knife making
association or uh,

202
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,240
yeah,
cuffed custom knife makers association

203
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,880
and then it stemmed off to the ABS,
which is the American bladesmith

204
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,490
society.
And that was all about the forge blade

205
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,760
and kind of the mission to retain that
knowledge and that history and in the

206
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:21,360
skills that go into actually taking a
piece of metal and forging a blade out

207
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,740
of it,
like you were blades,

208
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,020
they were forged to shape.
They were a one pr approach is to just

209
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:31,800
take a bar steel trace out a line,
cut that out.

210
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,710
Whereas talking about it's totally valid
way of doing it.

211
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,100
Um,
forging the forging aspect.

212
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,530
Uh,
especially if somebody doesn't actually

213
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:43,080
know what they're doing,
they're just like heating up a piece of

214
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:44,700
steel.
They don't know how fucking hot it is

215
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:45,060
getting.

216
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,890
They don't know how when to stop hitting
it.

217
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:50,040
They may be hitting it too cold,
they may be overheating it and hidden it

218
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,850
and while it's way too hot,
they could really actually do

219
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,380
detrimental damage to the material and
turn out a piece of shit.

220
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,400
Um,
so the forge aspect really just brings

221
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:07,401
kind of an aesthetic and it kind of a
depth of story to help bring kind of a

222
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,140
more to that product.
Well,

223
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,310
it's another level,
right?

224
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,920
Yeah.
It's just another layer of it.

225
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:15,120
Yeah.
It's not just hand crafting something

226
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:15,620
from,
uh,

227
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,370
you know,
just a piece of metal that you bought

228
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:19,800
and you put all the pieces together and
Polish it down,

229
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,380
sanded it.
When did you get into this?

230
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,490
So I,
it's a kind of a funny story.

231
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:31,350
So I got into this back in 2008 is when
I met Bob Kramer.

232
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,540
At the time I was working in a
restaurant,

233
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,820
uh,
actually in my hometown of Olympia.

234
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,670
Um,
and I was working at a restaurant.

235
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,930
I was moonlighting as an assistant salsa
dancing instructor and doing like,

236
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,920
uh,
uh,

237
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,400
like community performances and shit
like that.

238
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,331
And,
uh,

239
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:51,870
I was 24 and I didn't know what the Hell
I was doing with myself and I didn't

240
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,910
really have much of a direction in my
life.

241
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,670
I was terrible at school.
Um,

242
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,050
you know,
I had maybe 40 credits towards,

243
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,010
towards an Ame,
but I don't even have him like an actual

244
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:03,780
certification or degree or have any kind
of,

245
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,040
so anyways,
I was,

246
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,420
I was sharing this with my dance partner
and she had just started working for

247
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:12,240
this guy who was a knife maker and she's
like,

248
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:13,051
Oh,
you should meet him.

249
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:14,880
He's really interesting.
Uh,

250
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,740
you know,
you kind of feel like you're lost.

251
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,020
He's been all over the world.
He's even like,

252
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:20,730
he was even a clown at one point.

253
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,090
Kramer.
Yeah,

254
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,040
he used to be a clown.
He was a clown I think for a year for

255
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,860
ringling Barnum and Bailey.
Um,

256
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,220
and if,
from what I understand,

257
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,940
it was a great experience and he loved
it.

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,800
And uh,
but anyways,

259
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,491
she's like,
you know,

260
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,350
I think you guys would hit it off.
I think,

261
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,750
you know,
maybe he could help bestow some wisdom

262
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:43,500
as to where you're at and where he was
at and maybe what kind of choices or

263
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:46,230
options you have ahead of you.
And so I met up with him,

264
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,940
uh,
at the brewpub or that I was actually

265
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:52,740
working at and got some beers because a
fish and chips sit and bullshitting and

266
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:55,930
it ended up turning into an a job
opportunity.

267
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,960
And neither of us really went into it
knowing that that's the direction it was

268
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:00,370
going to go.
But,

269
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,200
uh,
he was anticipating,

270
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,440
he had an article coming out in the New
Yorker like in a month and that was

271
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:11,950
going to really like blow his shit up.
And he had had a couple big articles

272
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:15,580
like in Savour magazine and he was
featured in Cook's illustrated at one

273
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,380
point and each time,
like,

274
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:21,610
there's a huge influx.
And so I think in part of anticipation

275
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:23,260
for that,
he's like,

276
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,360
look,
you seem like a nice guy.

277
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,370
You don't really seem to have a
direction.

278
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,120
Maybe we could work something out.
I can't make any promises to you that I

279
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:33,280
have full time work for you.
Um,

280
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,950
so he just took you on as an apprentice,
essentially

281
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,710
video with him,
Anthony Bordain.

282
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:42,790
That's how I found out about him.
He was making a knife with meteors,

283
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,710
right.
Meet with a piece of media right in it

284
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,940
as well.
Same kind of thing.

285
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,950
And uh,
I remember thinking like,

286
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,120
wow,
crazy is this,

287
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:51,940
this guys hammering this thing together
and put into that.

288
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,170
That was like one of the ways that I got
interested in custom knife making sure

289
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,300
it might.
I'd always had knives,

290
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,500
you know,
like pocket knives and I always kind of

291
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:07,120
thought they were cool and enjoyed them.
But until I watched that video I didn't

292
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:09,160
realize that there was a lot of people
out there.

293
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:09,994
There it is.
Yup.

294
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,280
Him and Anthony,
I didn't realize there was a lot of

295
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:15,160
people that are out there doing this
from scratch.

296
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,080
And then,
you know,

297
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,861
then I was like,
oh,

298
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:19,390
I gotta get a knife.
And then,

299
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,160
then I saw your page on instagram and I
remember thinking,

300
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,200
Wow,
this guy does some wild shit.

301
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,660
And I don't remember how you and I got
to chatting.

302
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,630
I don't remember.
I just remember seeing your stuff on

303
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:32,090
instinct.

304
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:37,070
You reached out to me on email and I was
like the Joe Rogan and I was like that

305
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,020
kid.
Was it an email?

306
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,540
Was it a instagram message?
Oh actually I'm not sure.

307
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,190
I think it was the email.
Email.

308
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,980
Either way from your website.
Yeah,

309
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,710
yeah,
yeah.

310
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,660
Oh you use had seen my email and one of
the previous conversation somewhere,

311
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,900
but I was like,
this can't be like the Joe Rogan.

312
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,920
And then as the conversation continued
on and I was like,

313
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,710
cause he also your picture for the
emails,

314
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:03,530
like this goofy picture of you doing
like Kissy face or something like that

315
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:05,920
was fucking hilarious.
And I was like me

316
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,260
and I was like,
Holy Shit,

317
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,000
I think this actually might be Joe
Rogan.

318
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,710
This is crazy.
Um,

319
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,890
and but it's doing this craft and doing
this work.

320
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:18,350
And,
and finding and connecting with people

321
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:22,490
who have an appreciation for the actual,
like the actual work that goes into it

322
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,500
and appreciating that value,
uh,

323
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,270
has been,
you know,

324
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,870
I like even five years ago when I first
started under my own brand,

325
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,990
there's no way it would've thought I'd
be sitting here hanging out with you

326
00:14:32,991 --> 00:14:35,630
guys.
It was kind of a been a crazy ride for

327
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:36,620
me.
It's crazy,

328
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,130
right?
Me

329
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,440
Too man.
All of it is life's crazy.

330
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,060
I believe that.
But like I said,

331
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,080
I've always had a deep appreciation for
artisans.

332
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,220
You know,
for art.

333
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,250
What I think this,
I think your knife making his art,

334
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,120
I mean I really do like at this as
Jamie's pulled up an image from your

335
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:56,900
website that shows this incredible blade
design.

336
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,420
Now this is what I've always wanted to
know.

337
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,300
Like is that Damascus steels that what
that is?

338
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,480
That is Damascus in and it's just a
quick note.

339
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:08,980
This is actually a post that I did to
celebrate another maker.

340
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:10,990
His name's Julian.
You can actually kind of see it there on

341
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:12,070
the right margin.
Now,

342
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:13,890
the,
he's a South American kid,

343
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,550
the blade,
the blades that you made,

344
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:19,850
that you have here today that you had,
that you're bringing with you for an

345
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:21,380
auction,
those,

346
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:24,440
the patterns on those things are fucking
insane.

347
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,170
How do you do that?
Like how do you make these,

348
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,100
cause it's not just steel for people
that are just listening to this.

349
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,930
Like that one is a great example,
right?

350
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,950
I would really love for people who are
just listening to just please go a

351
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,890
spout,
go spread out.

352
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:41,010
Go back to the,
uh,

353
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,730
page Jamie.
So I could see the headline string.

354
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,750
It's stuck.
What do you mean you can't shrink?

355
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:51,770
It got zoomed in and zoom out.
What happened?

356
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,930
I did it with the touch pad.
What did you oh,

357
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:56,120
the touch pad.
These God damn,

358
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,800
we've got an old ass laptop there.

if you go there,
that's his page.

373
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,290
You'll be able to check it out and order
books are closed.

374
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,010
Yeah.
Bad quarter.

375
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:27,730
Yeah.
I,

376
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,190
I'm a,
I met three years right now and I just

377
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:32,800
kind of like,
I had to shut it down because it's kind

378
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,830
of an overwhelming point.
Yeah.

379
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,930
Like it's a good problem,
but it's overwhelming because it's a

380
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,180
fuck,
I can imagine.

381
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,290
Yeah.
And balancing,

382
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,690
doing the work with now the,
you know,

383
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:46,750
like the marketing and branding,
maintaining relevance through social

384
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:50,590
media and taking the time to create
content on top of all of that.

385
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,760
It,
I mean,

386
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,010
especially when you're first starting to
do it,

387
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,840
the content part side of it,
it fucking time,

388
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,843
time consuming.

389
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,580
Crazy like long waiting lists,
man.

390
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:01,414
Three years.

391
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,830
Yeah.
And realistic.

392
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,480
My hair,
it's actually in the,

393
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:08,660
at least in the knife making world,
it's not uncommon for people to actually

394
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:09,770
wait longer than that.

395
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,610
This is the same thing with the pool cue
world.

396
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,860
Right.
This is really the exact same thing.

397
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,420
A lot of these,
uh,

398
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:20,220
famous pool cue manufacturers like
southwest or sugar tree and then they

399
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:24,210
have 10 year waiting lists and it's just
because they do it right.

400
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,760
It takes a long time.
Everything's done by hand.

401
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,490
They're highly sought after.
And because of that,

402
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:31,680
like you could buy a pool cue from a,
you know,

403
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:34,380
a company that makes them through,
you know,

404
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:37,410
computerized process and they're fine.
They play really good.

405
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,350
Just like a knife that you'd buy from a
store that's made by a machine and saw

406
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:45,840
all done mass manufacturing,
it'll cut your meat.

407
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,710
It works great.

408
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,030
Yeah,
it gets the job done,

409
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,670
but it doesn't feel the same thing.
It doesn't feel,

410
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,450
it's crazy.
Like you can feel the difference between

411
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,810
a handmade thing and a machine made
thing.

412
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,790
It's,
it's bizarre.

413
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,320
It trips me out every time.

414
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,470
Well,
there's a little something that people

415
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:05,840
leave and things that they make.
I mean,

416
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:06,710
there really is.
I mean,

417
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,390
I,
I think it exists in everything that

418
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:10,190
people make,
whether it's clothing or jewelry or

419
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,920
furniture or anything.
Let me just think there's a little

420
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:15,060
something that people leave when they
in,

421
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,250
in a thing that they make.

422
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,430
Okay.
What do there's something that you talk

423
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,650
about sometimes about how animals
inherit,

424
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,030
like,
uh,

425
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,740
passed down through genes.
Like,

426
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,550
watch out for this plant and watch out
for these predators and shit like that.

427
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,810
Like the passing something on like that
kind of in a way like where I'm toiling

428
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,820
over something like that for,
you know,

429
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,490
40 dedicated,
solid fucking hours.

430
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,530
Right.
Making sure it's as perfect as I

431
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:43,531
possibly can make that thing at this
point in my life with the skills I got.

432
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,000
And I think

433
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,090
there's something to that.
I mean,

434
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:51,270
even if it's just a thought,
even if you just know when you touch it,

435
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:54,160
like if I touch this knife,
I know that you made this,

436
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,271
you know,
when I'm,

437
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:57,220
when I'm cutting something with this and
I'm cooking,

438
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,830
I know that you made this.
So maybe it's just,

439
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,340
even if it's only in my head,
it's still,

440
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,440
it just feels different,
you know?

441
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:06,274
And I,
I,

442
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,840
I don't know.
I mean there's,

443
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,830
there's rupert sheldrake who's a,
I don't know what exactly kind of

444
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:16,180
scientist he is,
but he has this bizarre theory and he's

445
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:19,930
a really interesting guy to talk to.
So I would never discount it.

446
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,230
He thinks that everything has memory.
He thinks he just,

447
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,020
you just can't access that memory.
But he thinks there's things that have

448
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:30,370
memories and he thinks that our idea
that memory is something that only

449
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:33,610
animals and humans possess is,
is just,

450
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,170
it's probably not true.

451
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,120
And that,
that's probably one of the reasons why

452
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:39,250
people don't want to buy a house where
someone was murdered.

453
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,270
You know what I mean?
Like the idea is that a haunted house,

454
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,920
even if it's not really a ghost,
like maybe that home has memories,

455
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,610
you know,
maybe like my dad went to Gettysburg and

456
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:53,680
uh,
he's not woo woo at all.

457
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,390
He's like as fucking straight laced
across the board.

458
00:19:58,391 --> 00:20:00,250
No bullshit as it gets.
And he said,

459
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:02,560
man,
you could feel sadness.

460
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:03,670
There.
He goes.

461
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:06,880
He's just think of how many thousands of
people died at Gettysburg.

462
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,410
And he said,
when you were there,

463
00:20:08,411 --> 00:20:10,540
it's just,
it feels sad.

464
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,310
Like you feel death.
Yeah.

465
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,640
Yeah.
I don't know if that's real or if it's

466
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:18,880
maybe the knowledge that you have that
there was a war there.

467
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,810
I mean,
I don't know.

468
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,640
I used to do the thing where I would
walk through cemeteries.

469
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,500
I'm just interested like looking at
people's names and like when,

470
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,890
when did they live and what did people
have to say about them or what,

471
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,830
you know,
what's left behind and just walking

472
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:36,810
through cemeteries.
Like sometimes I would even do it on

473
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:38,310
Halloween attraction,
my answer.

474
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,060
And it definitely feels weird in there.

475
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,440
I used to run through some guitars.
I used to run through them because I

476
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:48,260
would,
uh,

477
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,670
I would want to be reminded that life is
short.

478
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,020
Get something done,
make something happen that all these

479
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,810
people that aren't here anymore.
But the thing about cemeteries,

480
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:00,130
it's like 30 dead when they get in
there.

481
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,100
Right?
I think like the memory thing is like,

482
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:04,420
you know,
if you're on a boat and somebody gets

483
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:07,090
murdered on that boat and you're in the
boat and you're like fucking freaking

484
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:07,400
out,
like,

485
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,400
hey man,
there's something about like,

486
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:17,620
things like if you had a thing,
if you had a wallet that Mike Tyson

487
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:18,640
owned,
you know what I mean?

488
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,140
You'd hold it.
You're like,

489
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:22,000
damn,
you know,

490
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,250
there's something to it.
Morphic resonance.

491
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:27,060
Okay.
That's Rupert sheldrake's theory,

492
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,370
uh,
to theory developed by Rupert Sheldrake,

493
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,150
British biologist,
a paranormal influenced by which a

494
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:38,110
pattern of events or behavior can
facilitate subsequent occurrences of

495
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:38,890
similar patents.

496
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,850
Oh,
that's right.

497
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,410
That is,
um,

498
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,840
that is not about it.
Memory,

499
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,240
that is,
that was his other theories referred to

500
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:50,190
in a lot of the other ways about memory
is inherent in nature and yeah.

501
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,120
Yeah,
I think that's part of it.

502
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:55,780
Like I think what I was talking about as
part of his theory of morphic residence,

503
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,820
but morphic residence,
I think he's,

504
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,801
he,
yeah,

505
00:21:58,801 --> 00:21:59,634
he's here.
It says that,

506
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,573
hold on,
scroll back,

507
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,460
scroll down.
So the process whereby self organizing

508
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:07,270
systems inherent a memory from previous
similar systems.

509
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,870
So when he was talking about with
morphic residence was um,

510
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,710
how mice if they learn,
um,

511
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,990
like say if you have a pattern and
there's like cheese at the end of this

512
00:22:16,991 --> 00:22:21,970
pattern and then they go through a maze,
if one mouse figures out that pattern,

513
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:25,720
other mouse can figure it out quicker
and there's something somehow or

514
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,520
another,
they learn from each other.

515
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,360
And when chimpanzees were observed using
tools,

516
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,530
other chimpanzees on the other side of
the world started mimicking that

517
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:38,230
behavior without any interaction with
those chimpanzees at all.

518
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,600
Yeah,
yeah,

519
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,950
yeah.
Very strange.

520
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,040
That's like fucking butterfly effects
shelter more intense than butterfly

521
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:52,111
effect because it implies that there's
some sort of collective information pool

522
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,550
that they're sharing,
um,

523
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,580
through the ether that there's some,
something that they are sharing through

524
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,040
some unknown method has crazy.
Yeah.

525
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,530
Well it's been a pr,
it's,

526
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:08,560
it's actually been shown that there is
some sort of a,

527
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,920
there,
there's something to this and there's a

528
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:14,770
lot of criticism of it.
So if you're one of those people right

529
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:17,620
now that's like a strict materialist and
you're screaming out,

530
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,930
I get it.
I get it.

531
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,860
If someone who's a real rationalist who
just wants only science,

532
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,450
provable.
The thing is,

533
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,610
it is kind of provable because there's,
there is,

534
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,730
there has been some tasks and there's
fierce opposition to this,

535
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:34,050
which is anything that has like some woo
attached to it,

536
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:35,590
it's going to have some fierce
opposition.

537
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:40,770
But Rupert was a really fascinating guy
and he's also a rare scientists.

538
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:42,760
That's he,
he,

539
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,380
he was,
he was Christian.

540
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,290
Is that what it was?
He's really into,

541
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,610
he has a certain level of Christianity
that he accepts and adopts cause he

542
00:23:53,491 --> 00:23:56,060
feels like it's beneficial to him.
Very interesting guy.

543
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,180
Yeah,
that's,

544
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,130
yeah.
I did a podcast,

545
00:23:58,131 --> 00:23:59,030
you know,
a few years back.

546
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,780
Yeah.
He's a trip him and um,

547
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,970
uh,
there was a mathematician and Terence

548
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,050
Mckenna,
who was the other gentlemen,

549
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,810
they were the,
it was the trial logs.

550
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,900
They had these fantastic recordings.
It was sheldrake Mckenna and one other

551
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:21,170
guy was also brilliant and they would go
back and forth.

552
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:23,570
They had these,
I'm Ralph Abraham,

553
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:25,850
Abraham Abrams or Abraham,
Abraham,

554
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,320
Abraham.
And they,

555
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:31,060
um,
they did these series of talks and a,

556
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,060
this is one of the things that came up,
like Mckenna was the most woowoo.

557
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,800
Ralph Abraham was the least woo woo.
And sheldrick was kind of in the middle,

558
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,320
right?
Yeah.

559
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,240
Interesting stuff.
If you've ever been around.

560
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,141
Yeah.
The trial logs.

561
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:46,700
There it is.
There.

562
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,590
The recordings is still available
somewhere,

563
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:50,870
I think.
Um,

564
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,780
our friend,
a psychedelic salon,

565
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:57,230
I think Lorenzo has them.
Are they available on line?

566
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,180
Oh,
there you go.

567
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,260
Bam.
Sound Fun.

568
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,750
Yeah,
they're fucking cool man.

569
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,620
Actually play it.
I don't know why you can't play it.

570
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,390
It was there.
I got to take him down now that yeah,

571
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:07,980
that is the case.
Looks I got removed.

572
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,020
Hmm.
Yeah.

573
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:10,430
Someone's probably selling it.
Yeah.

574
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,410
It's really cool though.
You know,

575
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,440
you get to see these guys in the 1990s
pre-internet,

576
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,460
was it pre internet might not have been.
It might be like 98 I think Mckenna died

577
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:26,771
around 2000 ish.
He died posts to hold a site.

578
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,550
Say he died like 2003 or something.
When did he die?

579
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,500
Why am I asking this?
This is all about memory and things as

580
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,810
we went on the fucking deep road off to
the woods here.

581
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,310
But anybody who's listening,
2000.

582
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,150
Yeah.
So he made it to y two K and then he

583
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:50,220
kicked the bucket.
Um,

584
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,810
anybody who's just interested in really
cool conversations,

585
00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:57,570
it's something to listen to.
That sounds very interesting.

586
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,430
Yeah.
Just three super smart dudes kinda

587
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:01,740
debating ideas and bouncing around off
each other.

588
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,080
You know,
what I've actually gotten into recently

589
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:07,650
is listening to old recordings of like,
uh,

590
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,900
Alan Watts.
Oh yeah.

591
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,270
Oh,
he was great reading Joseph Campbell and

592
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,550
just like,
yeah.

593
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:16,800
I don't know.
Just absorbing it and trying to figure

594
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:21,801
out what that means to me today in this
like the hero different world.

595
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,760
Yeah.

596
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,500
Yeah.
Watson is a fascinating guy.

597
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,720
Plus that accent made him sound so much
cooler.

598
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,853
Yeah.

599
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,370
Drone [inaudible] yeah.
His actually,

600
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,810
the first time I ever gotten to a good,
uh,

601
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,673
like,
uh,

602
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:42,490
like a meditative space was a meditation
led by Alan Watts from like,

603
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,190
I don't know when the fuck

604
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,240
it was like 60 seventies.
And just the way he explained it for me,

605
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,870
like it was the first time I'd ever made
sense how meditation should,

606
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,450
he's like,
don't try to not think of anything,

607
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,540
but just accept them that the there and,
but also ignore them at the same time.

608
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,810
Yeah.
It was weird.

609
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:05,370
And then I just totally like,
I felt like I was above myself watching

610
00:27:05,371 --> 00:27:08,040
me.
So just sitting there listening to this

611
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:08,874
recording,
it was a trip.

612
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,250
Well,
he was such a heady guy.

613
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,340
There's the sound of his voice and just
hearing his thoughts.

614
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,710
When you,
when you hear a really deep thinker like

615
00:27:15,711 --> 00:27:17,360
him,
one of the things that it does is kind

616
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:20,240
of gets you into that pattern of thought
and you realize like,

617
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,030
oh,
I can probably kind of sorta think that

618
00:27:23,031 --> 00:27:26,390
way too.
We'll just allow myself to be guided by

619
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,080
his words and sort of try to pay
attention to how he's doing this.

620
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,280
Yeah,
he's,

621
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:34,670
um,
he was an interesting guy because not

622
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:37,040
just was he a deep thinker,
but his,

623
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,800
the,
the influences of those people.

624
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,870
It's,
it's very different.

625
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:45,440
Like there's very few recordings even
back then for them to listen to,

626
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,560
you know,
this stuff was based on reading,

627
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,310
um,
and their education and their actual

628
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:56,120
life experiences.
So they were very unique and original.

629
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:59,330
They were the really the cornerstones
for a lot of these deep philosophical

630
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:00,710
ideas,
you know.

631
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:04,430
And so then when you hear an Alan Watts
recording today,

632
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,360
you know,
maybe someone like me or some other

633
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,550
people that listen to that,
they'll might,

634
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:12,170
might share those ideas or reflect on
those ideas.

635
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:17,171
But clearly these are not my ideas.
These are ideas that have come from

636
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,560
these intense cornerstone people,
whether it's Mckenna,

637
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:25,010
Alan Watts or something like that.
Do you get a chance while you're,

638
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:27,410
when you're working,
do you listen to shit or do you just,

639
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,100
yeah,
I got all the time to sit in.

640
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,370
The headphones are cause it seems like
it'd be loud as fuck.

641
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,060
Yeah,
so I just got Ahold of these like

642
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:40,110
Bluetooth head head and like earbuds and
they have this memory phone so they are

643
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,610
memory foam,
ear bud like tips.

644
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,730
So that helps reduce the amount of noise
it's actually coming in.

645
00:28:45,731 --> 00:28:48,190
So it helps protect it in that way.
Just kinda in general,

646
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,210
like a normal,
like a inner ear plug would work.

647
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,970
But also because it's reducing the
amount of noise that's getting in.

648
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:59,971
You can also listen at a lower volume so
you're not like blowing out your ears to

649
00:29:00,311 --> 00:29:02,530
be able to hear whatever you're
listening to.

650
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,210
Like you wouldn't through normal
earbuds.

651
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,400
Right.
So loud in your shop.

652
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,490
So much noise.
It's whenever I'm working,

653
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,270
like especially if somebody happens to
pop by the shop and they want to see and

654
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:16,660
like they're just curious and so we have
stuff going on or we can heat some steel

655
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:18,490
up real quick and do a quick
demonstration.

656
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:23,560
Usually I don't take the time to throw
all that stuff in and fuck it is so

657
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,120
loud.
I actually feel like my hearing is

658
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:30,121
become more sensitive since I started
making knives than it was before.

659
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,470
Um,
probably your years of getting beat up.

660
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,610
Well you always have earplugs in.
I always have hearing protection and so,

661
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:40,150
so my hearing is always protected so I
feel like it's become more sensitive.

662
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
I've a sense

663
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,930
of hearing.
I don't know if that's possible to get

664
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:46,430
your hearing back or whatever,
but uh,

665
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,060
maybe your protect doing better because
of that.

666
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,103
Yeah,
I just,

667
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:54,220
I hear a lot of things,
like all the things it feels like

668
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:56,980
whenever I take my hearing or that you
in a hearing protection out,

669
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,240
I'll be at home or something and I'm
picking what the Lux,

670
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,500
that noise and my wife's looking at me
like I'm fucking crazy.

671
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:02,960
I'm sorry,

672
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,760
one us the case.
I wonder if like,

673
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,560
maybe it's like,
you know,

674
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:09,140
people don't use their hands and then
the hands get soft.

675
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,630
I don't know.
You can't gain it back.

676
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,000
Okay.
But you might be protecting it longer

677
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,200
and since your habit sensitivity issue,
maybe since it's quiet or all day.

678
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,050
So if you blow it out from like concerts
and shit like that,

679
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:25,880
that's it.
I tell it was while you can do is get a

680
00:30:25,881 --> 00:30:26,714
hearing aid.
Oh yeah.

681
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,630
What about the little hairs?
The stem cells or some shit.

682
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,840
They don't do that yet because it's
literally what you hearing.

683
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:33,470
What is,
uh,

684
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,840
like a hair follicle.
It's vibrating.

685
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,260
Blow that shit out.
They haven't synthetically made those

686
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:40,560
yet.
Throw him yet.

687
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,600
I feel so bad for those old rock stars.
It didn't know any better and now they,

688
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,463
they're just fucking,
yeah.

689
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,260
[inaudible] happened to him.

690
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,840
Huey Lewis can't play anymore.
All of a sudden.

691
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,480
That's the Lord's work.
Just kidding.

692
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,973
Just kidding.
Anyway,

693
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,050
it's hip to be square.
Um,

694
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:56,921
yeah,
man.

695
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,730
It's fucked up.
Like the dude from ACDC.

696
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,170
Who else?
Yeah,

697
00:31:01,171 --> 00:31:02,980
Angus has gone.
Oh Jesus.

698
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,270
Yeah.
Fucking,

699
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:06,600
everybody's going deaf.
Yeah.

700
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,970
Probably didn't protect themselves.
I think you should have nobody knew any

701
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:10,804
better back then.

702
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,330
Have you ever seen that documentary?
It's an older one.

703
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,180
Older one.
It was like from the early two thousands

704
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:20,230
but this woman,
she progressively got deafer and deafer

705
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,460
as she grew older until like I think she
in high school or something and like she

706
00:31:24,461 --> 00:31:28,750
was like practically completely deaf.
But she's a percussionist and she's like

707
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,030
a world renowned percussionists.
There's this awesome documentary is

708
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,540
called a touch the sound and she hears
through her body,

709
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,970
which is a fun trips me out,
but the tones that she's able to achieve

710
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,640
that control,
she has over everything,

711
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,070
whatever kind of instrument she's
playing.

712
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,450
It's an awesome documentary.
Wow.

713
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:55,210
But she has almost literally no hearing.
She hears everything through her body

714
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,390
too.
So it's kind of interesting to think

715
00:31:58,391 --> 00:32:01,480
like if angus could figure that shit out
then,

716
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,390
I mean he's holding the fucking thing is
the whole time he's standing in front of

717
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:06,850
the angus,
the lead singer.

718
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,720
Right,
right,

719
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,440
right.
Who's the,

720
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,420
what's the lead singer's name?
Fuck's his name?

721
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,830
Second lead singer.
Brian Johnson.

722
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,130
And I forget that he's gone deaf too.

723
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,230
Hang,
listen,

724
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,020
Brian and,
and angus is like always headbanging

725
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,770
what kind of cte does that guy have?
No,

726
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,080
Jesus fucking Christ.
He shouldn't be doing that.

727
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,550
You were talking about dee dee about
that the other day.

728
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,390
I was,
I was thinking like all through high

729
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:37,790
school,
like I played football from seventh

730
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:41,480
grade all through high and like all this
stuff they're learning now.

731
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:42,650
I'm just like,
Jesus,

732
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:46,760
what the fuck was happening to me to ct?
We always lead with our head.

733
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,390
Of course.
Yeah.

734
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,520
My neck was always all kinds of fucked
up and you know,

735
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,460
I definitely had some serious
concussions.

736
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,340
Well I'm sure and yeah,
uh,

737
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,580
sometimes it scares me and worries me a
little bit.

738
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,980
Like what does that mean for how old are
you now?

739
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,940
34.
Yeah,

740
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,080
man.
Just turned 34.

741
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,690
Um,
it's scary.

742
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,790
You know,
you're lucky you stopped when you did.

743
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:13,060
I know,
I know a lot of people with brain damage

744
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,130
meat too.
I,

745
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,350
I'm sure I have some guaranteed.
I must,

746
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,510
I mean,
I don't think anybody rides for free.

747
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,050
I think you get hit in the head enough,
you got some brain damage.

748
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,680
You know,
I got hit in the head on a regular basis

749
00:33:26,681 --> 00:33:31,681
for most,
most of my younger years from like 15 to

750
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:35,230
like 22 yeah,
I got to hit in the head all the time.

751
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,040
It's just
nobody knew any better,

752
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,710
you know.
And back then you thought that like once

753
00:33:41,711 --> 00:33:45,610
you got like once you were slurring your
words and stuff,

754
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:48,820
if he just stopped like,
oh he's a little punchy,

755
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:50,020
you should stop.
Right?

756
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,000
Like that's how people thought,
but they didn't realize that it's

757
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:56,380
regressive and then like you don't even
really show brain damage like 10 years

758
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:58,490
after the initial injuries.
Right.

759
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,760
That's when you really start showing
damage.

760
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,840
So some,
some cte just compounds it until it just

761
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:07,240
becomes unmanageable for these poor
people.

762
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,180
Yeah.
And it's,

763
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,320
I actually,
I can't,

764
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,330
especially after watching concussion
and,

765
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,870
and seeing and reading like articles
about the real life people that this

766
00:34:15,871 --> 00:34:17,760
shit's happened to.
I like,

767
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,180
I have a hard time watching football and
like I used to watch football time.

768
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,020
I've never been like crazy in a sports.
Knowing all the stats and every stuff.

769
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:28,500
I enjoyed watching like a good contest.
I never really rooted for anybody.

770
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,480
But now when I see like even kids
signing the draft or signing up from

771
00:34:33,481 --> 00:34:35,520
high school to go to a certain college,
I'm like,

772
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,080
man,
that's somebody who's fucking baby.

773
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,050
I'll fucking tearing themselves up.
Like,

774
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,460
is that worth it?
Yeah,

775
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,180
that worth I would like Aye.

776
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,630
Port kids fighting way before I would
support kids.

777
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,190
Um,
doing football,

778
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,650
both of them.
I'd be nervous about it.

779
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,650
And you know,
I mean there's other stuff like x games

780
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:57,260
type shit.
People that are into extreme sports and

781
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,000
you know,
people that are in the snowboarding,

782
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:03,290
snowboarders wipe out all the time and
crack their head open ledger.

783
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,680
Can you get a scholarship and martial
arts of any kind?

784
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,210
College,
just wrestling.

785
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:08,930
I mean,
that's like a big,

786
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,940
that's a big driver right there though.
Right?

787
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,310
Wrestling,
that's where the money is.

788
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,110
Certainly a martial art.
It's probably one of the most important

789
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:16,550
martial arts.
That's probably it,

790
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:17,091
right?
Yeah.

791
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:17,841
That's it.
I mean,

792
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:20,840
judo maybe.
Is there a school that has judo?

793
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,470
They used to have boxing in schools.
I mean back in like fifties and sixties

794
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:25,220
and shit,
there was,

795
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,690
boxing was a a legitimate sport in
college but not anymore.

796
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,520
Yeah,

797
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,390
yeah,
yeah.

798
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:33,640
It just,
I can't really watch it anymore.

799
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,220
I mean you have to be careful with your
hand eye and your fingers

800
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,020
and shit now you know,
I mean you gotta think like when you're

801
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:46,530
working with hammers and hot metal and
you,

802
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:51,060
you must always have to be [inaudible].
Everybody that works in machine shops

803
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:53,850
missing that fingertip.
Something's fucked up.

804
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,550
This crazy story is to buffer the
buffer.

805
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,170
Like the fluffy little thing is like one
of the most dangerous things because it

806
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:03,210
catches an edge.
If you're snowboarding,

807
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:08,211
you catch a bad edge and just plan.
It bites the blade bites into that and

808
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:13,671
it acts as a hand and just rips it,
flings it wherever it's throwing knives

809
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:15,990
right back into guys and fucking killed
him.

810
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,410
Oh fuck.
My wife probably hating me.

811
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,350
Say that.
Right?

812
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,290
Yeah.
This is reality.

813
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:24,330
I've done,
I've actually done a lot of work to get

814
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:28,740
away from using buffers because of that.
And I'm still like doing great work.

815
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:31,110
I just,
I have a lot of friends who just,

816
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,320
they'll never touch a fucking buffer and
terrifying.

817
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,770
It's scary.
What does it look like for pizza put up?

818
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:39,060
Like what,
what would you call it?

819
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,550
Maybe she didn't like it.
Buffing.

820
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,170
Wash it.
I don't know what usually,

821
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,530
usually it's like a,
a bench top thing,

822
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:49,920
like a bench grinder.
Usually it has like the hard wheat round

823
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,170
stone wheel on one size at it.
That's it right there.

824
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:55,620
Those mother fuckers,
that's just not one fucking day was

825
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:59,070
going to kick this going to go.
It's not making me nervous.

826
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,650
That look,
that looks like something.

827
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,840
So if you fucked up and you got that
blade to close and kick it and then that

828
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:09,160
one is what's called a sizable wheels.
So it's,

829
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:11,800
it's made from a t that type of rope,
but the,

830
00:37:11,801 --> 00:37:16,260
the ones that are the most dangerous or
the softer cotton wheels because they

831
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:19,080
want to grab that much easier.
They have more give.

832
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,120
Um,
but yeah,

833
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,670
it's,
and what's interesting is I've actually

834
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,810
been cut less working in a,
in a metal shop than I ever did working

835
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,780
in and burned less than I ever did
working in,

836
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,500
in kitchens.
I worked in restaurants back at house

837
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:39,420
like for seven years collectively.
And most of that has to do with other

838
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:42,910
people not calling like hot coming
across and fucking,

839
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,610
I turned around,
they don't call it,

840
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,620
I turned around there,
there with this fucking saute pan right

841
00:37:47,621 --> 00:37:50,040
in the side of my arm.
I'm ready to fucking drop it.

842
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,760
Right.
But it's being in a metal shop,

843
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,910
like you said,
you do have to pay so much attention.

844
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,480
You have to be focused at what you're
doing because literally everything in

845
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:03,120
that fucking shop wants to hurt you or
kill you.

846
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,420
The second you're not paying attention
to the second you're not paying

847
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:09,360
attention,
it's going to grab you like their horror

848
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:14,250
stories of people working next to
machines and they have long hair and it

849
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:19,251
just fucking
scalps and like just straight heritable

850
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,730
stuff.
Arable cider in the power tool last

851
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,331
week.
Oh yeah.

852
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:27,060
He got a power tool stuck in his balls.
Who was that

853
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,080
poor bastard?
Yeah.

854
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,640
Got It.
Brian Wilson.

855
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,540
Yeah.
Drill that uh,

856
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,160
he lost his hearing due to not

857
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,900
plot,
putting in earplugs at a car race,

858
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,080
not music
specifically.

859
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,930
There was a quote Brian Wilson from the
beach boys.

860
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,600
Uh,
Brian Wilson from the beach boy or I'm

861
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:47,410
sorry,
he,

862
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,560
this article has him at the top.
Brian Johnson.

863
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,410
Johnson from cars.
Yeah.

864
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,960
Well,
how the fuck does he know mother fuckers

865
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:57,620
in AC DC?
Yeah.

866
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,380
Wouldn't you think that'd be loud too,
Bro?

867
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:02,140
Angus young says it.
He lost a little bit,

868
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:04,360
but he's,
his quote says that he never really had

869
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:06,940
a problem with it because that's why he
was running around on stage so much too.

870
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:12,400
He's never in one place so long.
The room,

871
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,700
that's hilarious.
Wisconsin or ever saw ICDS.

872
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:17,500
ACDC.
I wonder if people were more

873
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:19,120
susceptible,
just like some people are more

874
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:22,320
susceptible to cte.
Yeah.

875
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:25,000
Remember Rhonda,
Patrick was talking about certain genes

876
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:28,090
that you have.
What does it apropos,

877
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,720
I forget what it was called,
but whatever genes that make you more

878
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:36,160
susceptible and more likely to get cte
from concussions problem.

879
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,130
Probably not to be something that
probably makes sense.

880
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,150
Now,
when you're in that shop and you're,

881
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,990
you're,
you're,

882
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:48,340
you're doing all this grinding,
is there any concern about chemicals

883
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,400
like dessert,
chemical ingestion or smells in the air?

884
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:54,580
I think that because you're,
you're dipping things and you've got all

885
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:55,650
this stuff that using,

886
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,581
yeah.
Especially for you.

887
00:39:56,581 --> 00:39:58,050
We're working with synthetic.
I mean,

888
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,270
any,
any material that you're grinding,

889
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,210
you're making it,
it's airborne.

890
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,800
Like any of it can go onto your loans.
I'm almost always wearing a respirator.

891
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,590
Oh Wow.
Especially when I'm grinding.

892
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,890
Um,
and it's like double can always like

893
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:14,970
covering up.
Does it work?

894
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:16,530
Does a respray are filled out.
All of it.

895
00:40:16,531 --> 00:40:17,970
It makes a huge difference.
In fact,

896
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,240
excuse me,
where have my facial hair right now?

897
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,340
Even this little bit,
what you got,

898
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:27,120
even that little bit is enough to create
a little gap and it can get through

899
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:28,890
that.
So you have to shave your face smooth.

900
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,640
Yeah,
usually I keep it pretty well now I'm

901
00:40:31,641 --> 00:40:33,270
now,
how the fuck do you create those

902
00:40:33,271 --> 00:40:35,040
patterns?
Like Damascus steel.

903
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,330
What is that?
Oh,

904
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:39,660
this doesn't have too much of,
that was not in the Damascus steel

905
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:40,494
unfortunately.

906
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,100
It's beautiful.
Yeah.

907
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:44,520
What,
what does create those black that,

908
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:45,600
there you go.
How do you do that?

909
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,260
We're looking at a crazy image that
looks like it almost looks like someone

910
00:40:49,261 --> 00:40:51,450
drew on it.
This is a,

911
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:53,370
this is a pattern that just came up with
recently.

912
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:56,040
It's called,
I call it the brain mosaic for lack of

913
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,330
better term.
Um,

914
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,230
but it just looks like a braid and it's
something I've been wanting to create

915
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:06,910
and really figure it out.
So essentially to create pattern welded

916
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:08,850
Damascus,
uh,

917
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:12,060
first off,
Damascus is kind of a blanket has become

918
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:15,720
a blanket term traditionally.
And originally it actually referred to

919
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:18,600
the steel that like the type of steel
that your knife,

920
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,150
this knife,
the media and knife is made from.

921
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:26,510
And it eventually became a blanket term
for all kinds of kind of pattern steel

922
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,030
in general.
Whether it's it,

923
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,680
it curdles naturally or if it's kind of
forced and created the way that pattern

924
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:34,514
was made.

925
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,800
Um,
so that's pattern welded steel.

926
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:41,210
And so you have to start with at least
two different types of high carbon

927
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:45,050
steel.
Ideally s steels that heat treat in a

928
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:47,600
similar range.
When you heat them up and squish on

929
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:50,240
them,
they they move at a similar rate.

930
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,530
And so,
uh,

931
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,830
most commonly people are working with 10
80 and 15 and 20.

932
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,610
Those are just codes for two different
types of high carbon steel.

933
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:01,280
But essentially you're bringing them up
to a high temperature.

934
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,870
You,
uh,

935
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,860
you squish them either under a big
hammer or under a press.

936
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:09,920
You can even actually do it by hand,
but you have to do kind of a smaller

937
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:14,150
bill it to create the patterns and get
it to stick because the trick is really

938
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:14,990
getting,
um,

939
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,710
getting them clothes evenly squishing it
out.

940
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:19,880
And it's like,
um,

941
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,620
if you've ever like rolled out dough or
anybody who's ever made like pastry

942
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:26,180
dough,
like you would use in a croissant,

943
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,180
you tear open a croissant,
you see all those layers in there.

944
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,030
And that's from a piece of dough being
rolled out,

945
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,150
fully rolled out.
And so it's Kinda the same fucking thing

946
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,910
but with metal.
But you have to have the kind of,

947
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,820
uh,
the right kind of temperature

948
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,170
environment,
kind of,

949
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:42,821
uh,
you,

950
00:42:42,821 --> 00:42:47,750
you want as little oxygen in there as
possible because of the oxygen creates

951
00:42:47,751 --> 00:42:50,990
carbon
or no carbon.

952
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:52,860
But iron oxide that helps,
uh,

953
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,820
kind of is detrimental to creating solid
weld bonds.

954
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,470
And there are different ways to achieve
that.

955
00:42:57,471 --> 00:43:01,340
But um,
once the 10 80 is the black steel,

956
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,160
the black color and the 15 and 20 is
the,

957
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,860
is the silver color,
and that's a difference in the way those

958
00:43:06,861 --> 00:43:09,760
steels performance harder or more
doable.

959
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,700
So they pretty much on edge more,
they pretty much form almost or perform

960
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,920
almost exactly the same.
They're there.

961
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,600
In fact,
chemically speaking,

962
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:20,630
they're almost exactly the same except
for the 15 and 20,

963
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,340
uh,
has a high level of nickel and end 0.2%

964
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,050
by volume or by weight.

965
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,100
And so that steel is traditionally used
in saw blades,

966
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,390
especially large big mill band saws.
Um,

967
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,430
you know,
like in Oregon there's like one of the

968
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:39,990
oldest continuously running,
uh,

969
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,150
wood saw mill.
It's still there and doing its thing

970
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,480
with these giant bandsaw blades that are
like 30 feet and that are uh,

971
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:54,850
in circumference and they're like foot
wide and there's monsters and foot wide.

972
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,830
You mean like thick?
No,

973
00:43:57,831 --> 00:43:58,041
no,
no.

974
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:01,880
Like they're only in like maybe a 16th
of an inch thick because you want to

975
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:04,220
narrow soccer so you're not wasting
material.

976
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,550
But their why to help prevent deflection
to keep it from kind of Swiss band saw.

977
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,510
I'm thinking of a circular saw for some
reason.

978
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:11,961
Sorry.
Yeah,

979
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:15,080
band saws.
So circular saw those.

980
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:19,310
Soccer's are usually probably around a
eighth of an inch to a quarter of an

981
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:22,130
inch thick.
But it's the same kind of idea is that

982
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:26,660
they're trimming down these giant logs
so they need a big fucking saw.

983
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,930
Whether it's circular break,
man,

984
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,010
I must be a fucking nightmare.
That's gotta be

985
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,480
such,
you don't want to be standing right

986
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:36,060
there when that you've seen an original
Samurai sword.

987
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,330
I've seen a few,
actually this one's from the 15

988
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:40,540
hundreds.
Check this shit out of us.

989
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:42,660
It.
Oh Shit.

990
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,070
This is the one that,
uh,

991
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:47,220
Mr Neil degrasse tyson was posing with
the other day.

992
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,010
Yeah,
that's a real one.

993
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,730
That's an actual Real Samurai sword,
right?

994
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:55,560
Right.
From the 15 hundreds.

995
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:00,580
See the race skin is nice.
Do you know when it was made exactly?

996
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:02,550
I don't think they know.

997
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,460
They just know it's from some time
period in the 15 hundreds for sure.

998
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,640
Sit Certificate of authentication that
came with it.

999
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:11,550
That explains,

1000
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,430
I'm just looking to see what the hormone
activity looks like.

1001
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,220
So the hormone is,
uh,

1002
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:25,180
you can kind of see this line that runs
parallel to the cutting edge and that

1003
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:31,361
usually indicates where the soft
materials stops and the hard materials

1004
00:45:31,691 --> 00:45:33,440
starts.
Um,

1005
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:35,800
and so the idea with these kinds of,
uh,

1006
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:40,810
the challenge with any knife is making a
knife that takes and holds a sharp edge,

1007
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,240
right?
For a good period of time.

1008
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,330
What's the key to that?
But it's also tough,

1009
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,540
which means like you can drop it and
it's not going to break.

1010
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,910
So like if you wanted a hunting knife or
something like that.

1011
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:54,050
So,
uh,

1012
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,420
a hunting knife,
throwing knives,

1013
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,570
those are harder working knives.
So you want to actually bring that

1014
00:45:59,571 --> 00:46:02,240
hardness down.
You don't have to bring it down a ton,

1015
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,730
but just a few points will make a huge
fucking difference in housing forms.

1016
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,700
Yeah,
exactly.

1017
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:09,890
What's the difference in the way that
knife is made?

1018
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:11,750
And this knife,
so they were temporary.

1019
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:16,670
They were heat treated the same.
So they were brought up to like 1500

1020
00:46:16,671 --> 00:46:17,210
degrees

1021
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,580
from people don't,
not lists are listening.

1022
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:22,580
Not watching this.
One of these knives is a hunting knife

1023
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,430
that uh,
how's that feel bad by?

1024
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,970
It's great man.
I'll have to love it.

1025
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,170
Yeah.
Nice.

1026
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,180
Um,
but it's uh,

1027
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:32,210
it's made very similarly.
If you look into the,

1028
00:46:32,211 --> 00:46:34,010
um,
the video of it,

1029
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,490
the handle's the same and it looks,
it looks very similar.

1030
00:46:37,491 --> 00:46:39,680
It has a different knife guard though.
It's pretty cool.

1031
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,900
Hold on.
What's that?

1032
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

1033
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:47,340
The garden keeps you,
it keeps your hand from sliding up.

1034
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:48,180
Yeah.

1035
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,680
I liked the way he made the handle too.
It's an interesting handles,

1036
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,580
curved and everything.
Where,

1037
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,600
where'd you get that pattern for?
Like some dough?

1038
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,720
Yeah.
So the first question,

1039
00:46:57,721 --> 00:47:00,210
I'm sorry.
I remember at first like what is the

1040
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:01,770
difference in the way they're treated?
Okay,

1041
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:02,101
yeah.
Yeah.

1042
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:05,850
So they were hardened.
So he treating the whole process is

1043
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:08,820
essentially heating up the steel,
make it hard,

1044
00:47:08,821 --> 00:47:12,360
and then you put it back into heat,
but a low,

1045
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:14,580
much lower temperature to kind of
toughen it up.

1046
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,520
Um,
and so you're pulling some of that

1047
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:20,850
hardness back.
So they were hardened the same way,

1048
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:25,230
but they were tempered at different
temperatures because one is a hard use

1049
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:27,270
knife while the chef's knife is not a
heartbeat.

1050
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:30,030
What is the difference between a temper
and what,

1051
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,350
like what does that mean?
So the tempering,

1052
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,520
uh,
so essentially,

1053
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:36,580
so I harden it,
so I bring it up to 1500 degrees,

1054
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,940
uh,
which is like a adult glowing orange

1055
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:44,941
color.
And then I dip it in a special oil that

1056
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:48,400
I have that's designed for quenching
materials,

1057
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:51,430
not just in knifemaking,
but all kinds of different industrial

1058
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:53,950
applications.
Clenching materials or oil,

1059
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,940
sorry,
quenching oil.

1060
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,880
What does that mean?
So that's cooling the,

1061
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,980
this hot steel down in a very short
period of time and punching it.

1062
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,510
Oil,
coal,

1063
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,140
oil,
not so actually the,

1064
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,570
depending on how the steel needs to be
heat treated,

1065
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,960
uh,
you actually want to heat up the oil so

1066
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:12,100
that it's,
uh,

1067
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,980
it's thinner.
And it also,

1068
00:48:14,981 --> 00:48:17,260
there's this thing that's called a vapor
jacket.

1069
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:21,910
So if you've ever like been next to a
wood burning stove and you drop a little

1070
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:25,120
water on it and you see that bead water
dance around on there,

1071
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,260
the same thing happens on the surface of
the blade except for the blade is a

1072
00:48:29,261 --> 00:48:30,130
source of the heat,
right?

1073
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,090
He put it in that oil.
All that oil is dancing around on it.

1074
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,480
So when the oil's thinner,
uh,

1075
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,750
it,
it's not as large of a jacket because

1076
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,620
when that jacket is large,
so jack encasing that steel,

1077
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,760
while it's trying to cool down,
um,

1078
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:51,610
it actually kind of acts as an insulator
and ruin or could potentially ruin.

1079
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:55,690
So not only do you put it in the oil,
but you want to agitate it to kind of

1080
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:57,840
break up that jacket.
Um,

1081
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:02,710
so it doesn't get a chance to just sit
there and all the way around the blade.

1082
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,090
And if it was cold it would,
it would be thicker.

1083
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:08,380
And so,
um,

1084
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:11,590
it would make a larger jacket actually.
And also the,

1085
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,040
it probably wouldn't be as,
uh,

1086
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,570
efficient I guess in cooling the steel
down.

1087
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,980
Cause ideally like for most seals,
you want to cool them down pretty much

1088
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:22,360
as quickly as you possibly can.

1089
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:24,010
So you have,
sorry,

1090
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:24,844
go ahead.
Sorry.

1091
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,590
So we could keep going.
I was just going to say you,

1092
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,820
you essentially have a,
depending on what kind of steel you're

1093
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:33,880
working with,
you have anywhere from half a second to,

1094
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,120
uh,
like five seconds to get it from 1500

1095
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:42,121
degrees or sometimes higher to below 800
degrees and the,

1096
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,940
so this knife would be more durable.
Is that what it is then?

1097
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,650
This knife durable?
Yeah.

1098
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,080
Tougher.
So in,

1099
00:49:49,081 --> 00:49:54,081
in knifemaking commonly refer to it as
being tougher so it can withstand coming

1100
00:49:54,311 --> 00:49:58,540
into impact with bone.
You could chop with that thing a lot

1101
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:02,310
more efficiently with a tougher knife
because this hasn't been tempered at it

1102
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,080
as uh,
as high of a temperature.

1103
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,293
Um,
it's,

1104
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:10,030
it's much harder than this one,
even though it's a few points,

1105
00:50:10,031 --> 00:50:13,570
those few points make a big difference.
And so if you were to take this out into

1106
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:15,360
the woods,
tried to do the same job as this one's

1107
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,710
just the cutting it,
it wouldn't necessarily snap.

1108
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,670
Um,
but parts of the cutting edge wood up

1109
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,460
blow out,
probably blow it and chips.

1110
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,530
Um,
I actually recently just from time to

1111
00:50:26,531 --> 00:50:31,010
time is good as a knife maker to make
sure that you're still doing your thing,

1112
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,690
your heat treating stuff.
All right.

1113
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,060
I take a knife and I just beat the shit
out of it for such hop through some wood

1114
00:50:36,061 --> 00:50:38,840
and then I actually took it to an antler
and beat the shit out of it too.

1115
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,880
And,
um,

1116
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:44,240
it's,
it is amazing that if you're doing

1117
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:45,890
things right,
you know,

1118
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:49,610
10 thousandths of an inch is enough to
really,

1119
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,690
to withstand impact of chopping through
would pretty well of course,

1120
00:50:53,691 --> 00:50:56,600
unless you're coming into contact with
like super,

1121
00:50:56,601 --> 00:50:58,730
yeah.
Nail or super dense knots,

1122
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,100
that's crazy because it's so thin,
right?

1123
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,970
That's actually on the thicker side.
This is on the thicker side at least,

1124
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,380
especially in longer cutting edge.

1125
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,350
That's probably twice as thick as it
actually needs to be.

1126
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,270
Wow.
Which is crazy,

1127
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,670
but it just,
it comes down to the material.

1128
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:17,030
Not everybody or a lot of people
mistakenly think,

1129
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:18,830
you know,
steel is steel,

1130
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:20,180
is steel,
is steel and whatever,

1131
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,390
but they're not,
steel is made for many different

1132
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:26,720
applications and they're actually very
specifically designed for those

1133
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:27,950
applications.
So,

1134
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,960
uh,
like a structural steel,

1135
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,450
this kind of stuff that,
you know,

1136
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:34,040
buildings are built out of very
different from this.

1137
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:38,000
It doesn't have very much carbon in it
at all that way.

1138
00:51:38,001 --> 00:51:38,930
So,
uh,

1139
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:41,120
the carbon is what helps make these
really hard.

1140
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,400
So lacking that carbon is,
allows it to be way tougher.

1141
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,970
So you can bend it all fucking day long.
No,

1142
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,740
exactly.
So that's why you want it for buildings

1143
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:55,100
in la where the earthquakes hit and they
wiggle a little bit.

1144
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

1145
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,530
Um,
this is much thinner than a lot of

1146
00:52:00,531 --> 00:52:01,520
other,
uh,

1147
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:04,820
hunting knives would be,
which is interesting,

1148
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:08,420
you know,
w with your use of this exotic metal and

1149
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:09,170
you know,
your,

1150
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:12,080
your methods,
you were able to do that.

1151
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,710
Well and also part of the reason that
you're able to do that is because it's

1152
00:52:15,711 --> 00:52:17,210
high carbon steel.
It has a,

1153
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,480
which means it has a high volume of
carbon comparatively a then other kinds

1154
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:26,360
of kinds of tool or cutlery,
steel.

1155
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,180
It was a benefit of high carbon versus
last carbon.

1156
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,340
Uh,
so high carbon allows you to,

1157
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,360
to,
um,

1158
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,370
especially for the,
the media rights deal,

1159
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:36,980
it's a,
it's a kind of crucible steel called

1160
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:39,710
woots.
And so the patterning you've seen there

1161
00:52:39,711 --> 00:52:44,711
is actually strands of carbon are
carbide material.

1162
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:49,790
So all the extra carbon floating around
in the matrix.

1163
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:54,820
The Iron Matrix of this steel jumps on
to these bands called carbides and there

1164
00:52:56,781 --> 00:53:00,650
are different elements in vanadium is
one of the elements in this steel that

1165
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,470
draws those carbon,
that carbon in.

1166
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:08,471
So what you're seeing are thousands and
thousands of all these ultra hard carbon

1167
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:11,660
bands floating around through the Iron
Matrix.

1168
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,390
Do you watch game of thrones?
I do.

1169
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,820
When they have like swords that are made
out of Valyrian steel.

1170
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,693
Sure.
Pissed off.

1171
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,750
Get the fuck out of here with your fake
magic style.

1172
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,010
Well,
and what's interesting back in the day,

1173
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:26,950
shit was fucking magical,
right?

1174
00:53:26,951 --> 00:53:28,800
Like they didn't understand what was
going on.

1175
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:29,903
Now how did they

1176
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,820
learn?
I mean,

1177
00:53:30,821 --> 00:53:33,220
what is the history?
I mean obviously that sword,

1178
00:53:33,221 --> 00:53:38,221
there's from the 15 hundreds but you
know from back in the Roman gladiator

1179
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:41,290
days and I mean,
how did they understand how to do this?

1180
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,210
So the steel that they were using in
Europe was not really that great.

1181
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,440
It was at the best shit.
Japanese,

1182
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,200
Japanese,
we just were pretty fucking good.

1183
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:51,110
Yeah.
As well as the park,

1184
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:56,180
the Persians and the Indonesians Vikings
material wasn't the greatest.

1185
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,060
Wasn't too barbaric,
no time.

1186
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,470
It's just,
it comes down to a what they had

1187
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,450
available to them.
Right?

1188
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,900
Yeah.
So who was the pioneer of like really

1189
00:54:06,901 --> 00:54:11,310
durable Badass sword material?
Was it Japanese?

1190
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:16,410
So probably so the Japanese and the
Persian slash Indonesian Persians,

1191
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,270
uh,
swords are probably the most legendary,

1192
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:24,180
you know,
they're the ones where like it could cut

1193
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:26,490
through silk floating in the air and
shit like that.

1194
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,650
Why is that?
What did they do different?

1195
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:33,950
So it's,
so the Persian steel is steel very,

1196
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:36,570
very,
very similar to these meetings.

1197
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:37,920
Right?
So it's a crucible.

1198
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:40,080
It starts,
it's called a crucible steel.

1199
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,850
And so essentially there's this clay jar
essentially called a crucible.

1200
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:48,450
People melt all kinds of stuff in it,
but you can mail melt steel in it as

1201
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:52,320
well.
And so they were making these ingots of

1202
00:54:52,321 --> 00:54:54,150
crucible steel and then forging them
out.

1203
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:57,720
And they really,
really very heavily relied on these

1204
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:02,220
carbide bans floating through the
material because unfortunately they

1205
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:04,230
didn't really have a very,
uh,

1206
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,810
advanced way of quenching that steel so
that not only do they have the bands,

1207
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:12,810
but they also had hard iron matrix as
well,

1208
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:15,810
that those bands were floating in.
So they really relied on those,

1209
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,380
that banding.
So the,

1210
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:17,630
they

1211
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:22,360
just learned from trial and error of
thousands of years of experimenting with

1212
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:26,080
different materials and different
locations that they got the iron from

1213
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:29,020
and different things that they added to
it to make steel.

1214
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:29,460
Yup.

1215
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,870
Absolutely.
And that's why like,

1216
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,180
you know,
you even watching game of thrones or

1217
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:36,960
other kind of medieval or movies set in
medieval times,

1218
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,590
you know,
there were very specific makers who were

1219
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:43,920
the best who could really make the shit
happen.

1220
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,340
And it's because they had a tradition
passed down to them.

1221
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,340
And you know,
all that's a lot of that stuff was very

1222
00:55:50,341 --> 00:55:53,220
fictional.
But in the real world,

1223
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,020
that was the same thing.
You know,

1224
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,310
you had very specific lineages of people
who had the,

1225
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:02,460
you know,
essentially the most advanced technology

1226
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:07,461
and skills and techniques for creating
the most highest performing weaponry

1227
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,470
essentially of the time,
which was like the currency of the

1228
00:56:10,471 --> 00:56:11,304
fucking time.

1229
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:16,850
Went to Japan fairly recently in and
filmed them working with a high level

1230
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:23,920
sword maker for a television show.
Trying to remember who it was.

1231
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:27,400
It was someone famous but it was really
bad ass.

1232
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:31,120
They went to this sword maker shop and
you know,

1233
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:35,980
I mean he's doing the whole thing like
hammering it all out and building a

1234
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:38,590
Samurai sword from scratch the way it's
always been.

1235
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,810
Yeah.
There are a few of those documentaries.

1236
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,210
Um,
so it is trending on youtube there you

1237
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,200
got to do,
usually you got to do a little bit of

1238
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:49,030
digging to find them.
Um,

1239
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,540
I,
I actually just watched a few of them

1240
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,680
like in the last five years,
I do not recall what they're going to

1241
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,490
make a Samurai sword.
One of these days.

1242
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,680
I might do it eventually.
Just,

1243
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,710
I mean I'm always going to do chef
science because that's what I know.

1244
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,420
Like,
that's the tool I know the most.

1245
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,270
That's the biggest market right there.
There's a giant,

1246
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,750
I mean for a super foodies and I'll let
you know.

1247
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:14,150
Well it's not only that,
but if you think about it like there's

1248
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,270
a lot,
there's a lot of mystique around

1249
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:24,271
Japanese sores or even the American,
but we knife as well as you know,

1250
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:25,390
Viking swords.

1251
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,680
But nowadays,
you know,

1252
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:31,450
people have that shit made but you know
it goes on a wall.

1253
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,300
The things that are really getting used
or like a hunting knife and a chef's

1254
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:36,810
knife and you know,
cooking knives are,

1255
00:57:36,811 --> 00:57:41,811
are used like almost literally in every
single household around the world every

1256
00:57:41,951 --> 00:57:43,660
day,
year round.

1257
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,270
And it's,
what's interesting is because of its

1258
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:53,510
ubiquity to our everyday life,
it lacks that mistake because we see the

1259
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,960
shit every day.
You don't think much of it versus a

1260
00:57:55,961 --> 00:57:57,910
Japanese sword.
People walk in here and they're like,

1261
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,790
fuck.
Well I tell you what

1262
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:01,780
thing man,
when people come over to my house and

1263
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:04,030
I'm cooking and they go,
where the fuck did you get that night?

1264
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:08,080
That happens all the time.
And when it's either this one or the

1265
00:58:08,081 --> 00:58:10,330
other one.
When I show them the bog oak one,

1266
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,160
same thing.
They like two.

1267
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,870
I'm like,
yeah man,

1268
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,080
check it out.
Now in terms of like this one or the

1269
00:58:17,081 --> 00:58:19,240
other one that you made me,
the other hunting knife that you made me

1270
00:58:19,241 --> 00:58:22,690
out of Damascus,
which one is like tougher or more

1271
00:58:22,691 --> 00:58:23,524
durable?

1272
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:27,930
So they've been heat treated to perform
very,

1273
00:58:27,931 --> 00:58:29,220
very,
very similarly.

1274
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:32,310
So the base,
you'd essentially have to destroy them

1275
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,350
to really determine which one outperform
the other.

1276
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:37,530
You have to stick it in a bowl and try
to break it.

1277
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,000
Yeah.
Essentially use it.

1278
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:41,710
How it's not supposed to be frying,
but it,

1279
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:43,590
they cut it keeps an edge.
So,

1280
00:58:43,591 --> 00:58:44,790
well man,
it's crazy.

1281
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:45,730
Yeah.
I mean I,

1282
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,640
I get nervous every time I touch the
blade.

1283
00:58:47,641 --> 00:58:49,730
I mean this thing slices through things.
Yeah.

1284
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,300
Now,
um,

1285
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,880
there's gotta be an art to,
uh,

1286
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,550
actually sharpening things too,
right?

1287
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:57,443
Oh,
for sure.

1288
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,260
And how do you know like the right angle
to a approach?

1289
00:59:01,261 --> 00:59:02,094
Sharpening?

1290
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,220
It's,
I mean there are a lot,

1291
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,540
they're actually a lot of great
information online there,

1292
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:11,210
especially in big cities like Seattle,
La,

1293
00:59:11,211 --> 00:59:12,590
New York,
uh,

1294
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:15,020
Austin,
there a Portland as well.

1295
00:59:15,021 --> 00:59:18,800
There is super reputable people.
Not only who will offer service,

1296
00:59:18,801 --> 00:59:22,820
but I usually offer lessons as I
suggest.

1297
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,920
Like if you can't afford it,
you know,

1298
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,290
you can dig around,
you can find the stuff online.

1299
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:32,650
But it's not the same as having
essentially having a coach next to you

1300
00:59:32,841 --> 00:59:34,820
saying uh,
or yeah.

1301
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,020
That's great.
That's perfect.

1302
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:37,200
That's where you want to be doing that
shit.

1303
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,280
Do you sharpen both sides?
I do.

1304
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,600
So you sharpen the top and the bottom.
I'm sorry,

1305
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:48,080
you mean the sides of the steel?
Would you sharpen it like this and then

1306
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:49,690
flip it over?
Yeah.

1307
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:53,140
Now what are those things?
And they have those metal things where

1308
00:59:53,141 --> 00:59:54,350
people go xing,
Xing,

1309
00:59:54,351 --> 00:59:55,220
shooshing.

1310
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,420
Yeah.
So those,

1311
00:59:56,421 --> 00:59:58,190
those ones seem like,
I'm like,

1312
00:59:58,191 --> 01:00:00,830
that looks brutal.
I wouldn't do that to a good knife.

1313
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,280
It so am I right thinking that way?
Well,

1314
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:07,940
it depends on the type of steel that
your knives made from and then what the

1315
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:10,820
material is that those rods are made
from.

1316
01:00:10,821 --> 01:00:15,800
So those are commonly referred to a
sharpening ron's or sharpening sticks.

1317
01:00:15,801 --> 01:00:17,870
But the reality is they're not actually
sharpening.

1318
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,400
What are they doing?
So they're,

1319
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,580
uh,
more accurately referred to as honing

1320
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:24,170
rods.
So what's happening at your,

1321
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:27,170
sorry,
at the cutting edge of your knife is you

1322
01:00:27,171 --> 01:00:29,960
have all these micro seriations
essentially if you go,

1323
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:31,030
uh,
take,

1324
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,050
take it under a microscope and look at
the cutting edge.

1325
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,740
It looks like a saw blade,
but they're like,

1326
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:40,070
they're fucking microns.
Micron is a millionth of a meter.

1327
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:42,680
Like they're teeny tiny.
So,

1328
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,530
but what happens over normal use?
Uh,

1329
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,930
those teeth,
they bend over,

1330
01:00:47,931 --> 01:00:51,350
they flex over or sometimes they
eventually wear out and fall off.

1331
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:56,480
And so what the honing rod does,
especially if they've bent over showing

1332
01:00:56,481 --> 01:00:57,570
it right there.
Woo.

1333
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,250
Yes,
yes.

1334
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:06,110
You want to ignore like those long
streaks and you're just like the tiny

1335
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:07,310
little thin black.
Yeah,

1336
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:10,900
that's the shit right there in black
line

1337
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,990
observation.
Are you looking at you?

1338
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,950
It's like someone's doing it tiered
instruction.

1339
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:20,030
But yes,
a youtube video.

1340
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:22,350
Crazy.
That is crazy.

1341
01:01:22,351 --> 01:01:23,360
I was like,
are you doing that shit?

1342
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:27,560
[inaudible] hundred x magnification view
from the top.

1343
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,470
Yeah.
So that's what's happening along your

1344
01:01:30,471 --> 01:01:32,060
cutting edge.
And what happens to those tiny

1345
01:01:32,061 --> 01:01:35,390
serrations where it bend over like I was
saying or break off.

1346
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:38,180
And so,
but as they bend over and it's just

1347
01:01:38,181 --> 01:01:42,320
normal shit that honing ron by swiping
across at Honing Ron.

1348
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:45,350
And you don't just do it willy nilly,
like you got to do it at the right angle

1349
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:48,530
and all this stuff.
But what it does is it realigns and

1350
01:01:48,531 --> 01:01:52,520
hones those teeth back into alignment.
So people mistakenly call them

1351
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:56,090
sharpening sticks because all of a
sudden their knife is sharp as fuck

1352
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:56,924
afterwards.

1353
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,710
But the reality is that it's honed those
teeth back into alignment so it can do

1354
01:02:00,711 --> 01:02:01,700
its job again.
No,

1355
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:06,050
what's the purpose of the leather strop
so that's just a gentler way,

1356
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:09,710
especially for things that are super,
super,

1357
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,800
a razor sharp,
which essentially have been sharpened to

1358
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:15,170
really high finish,
uh,

1359
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,560
like 10,000 grit or higher.
So those micro serrations are even

1360
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:21,090
smaller,
which means there are even more

1361
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:23,220
delicate,
which means they don't need as much

1362
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:26,660
force to realign them.
So honing rod or Ho or,

1363
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:29,160
sorry,
a strop is,

1364
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,150
that's a human hair.
Yeah.

1365
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:33,320
Jesus Christ.
That looks disgusting.

1366
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:36,810
I just choking on that hair.
So just to give you some reference,

1367
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,840
a typical and average human hair is
about three thousandths of an inch.

1368
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,380
Well,
uh,

1369
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:48,570
yeah.
And to help put that a little bit more

1370
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:50,730
better perspective,
a 16th of an inch,

1371
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:56,030
like a normal measurement,
one 16th of an inch is 62.5 thousands of

1372
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,300
an inch.
So that's like one,

1373
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,230
I can't even do the math,
right.

1374
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:06,180
One 20th of a 16th of an inch,
which is fucking teeny tiny.

1375
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,630
It's crazy.
It's like split the hair.

1376
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,080
Yeah.
Literally.

1377
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:14,010
Yeah.
Um,

1378
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:19,070
there's a big debate and uh,
the world of bow hunting with broadheads

1379
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:23,420
with a what kind of steel to use.
And,

1380
01:03:23,421 --> 01:03:24,740
uh,
there's,

1381
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:27,270
there's harder steel that,
uh,

1382
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,030
some people use,
but it breaks.

1383
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,950
And just saying there's an issue with
that.

1384
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,020
And there's,
there's like this big debate,

1385
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:38,021
harder versus steel that has less hard,
but we'll bend more and give slightly

1386
01:03:39,111 --> 01:03:40,460
more,
you know?

1387
01:03:40,461 --> 01:03:41,330
And then there's,
um,

1388
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,340
there's a,
the broadhead that I use,

1389
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:47,030
which is a carbon steel broadhead from a
company called [inaudible].

1390
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:49,280
They make this a broadhead called a
[inaudible] tech.

1391
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:50,660
It's pull up,
um,

1392
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,440
g five carbon steel monotech.
So your top tech cs,

1393
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:57,980
they call them.
So you're talking to,

1394
01:03:57,981 --> 01:04:01,910
it's just the head like term,
just what a triangular or is it even a

1395
01:04:01,911 --> 01:04:04,400
triangle hunting?
The one that I use.

1396
01:04:04,401 --> 01:04:05,390
Yeah,
it is.

1397
01:04:05,391 --> 01:04:06,224
It's,
uh,

1398
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:07,940
it,
it has a,

1399
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:10,660
it was a three points or four points
here.

1400
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:11,503
He'll pull it up.
You see?

1401
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,620
That's it.
Oh yeah,

1402
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:14,000
sure.
So there's three points,

1403
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,730
but that's,
that's a carbon steel broadhead.

1404
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:21,620
That's what I shot my elk with last year
with and that things virtually

1405
01:04:21,621 --> 01:04:22,730
indestructable.
Yeah,

1406
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:25,160
there's a,
I have a crazy photograph.

1407
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:26,480
I'll show you this crazy video.
Oh,

1408
01:04:26,481 --> 01:04:30,810
I put it up on my instagram.
Find that on my instagram where I'm uh,

1409
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:35,600
I was fucking around with something on
my bow at,

1410
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:37,780
at full draw.
I was trying to set something and the,

1411
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:43,300
the Bo went off and it hit a cement wall
and it's stuck into the wall like a

1412
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:48,020
cinder block or solid,
some solid cement wall and didn't kill

1413
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:50,870
the broadhead.
I still have the broadhead back there.

1414
01:04:50,871 --> 01:04:53,030
It's stuck into the broad head.
Look at it.

1415
01:04:53,031 --> 01:04:57,770
Did it stuck into the broadhead,
the shaft and look what it did to the,

1416
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:02,860
to the Arrow that we'll look at that,
that brought ed that fucking things got

1417
01:05:02,991 --> 01:05:06,140
my bet for life.
That things got my confidence forever.

1418
01:05:06,141 --> 01:05:09,350
Cause if that does that to concrete,
what will that do to bone?

1419
01:05:09,351 --> 01:05:11,240
Right.
You know that we'll go through anything

1420
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,500
that's going to kick some ass.
Silver.

1421
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:14,550
One of the things I would say after
seeing that,

1422
01:05:14,551 --> 01:05:18,310
especially that first image is the
geometry of

1423
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,700
the blades that the actual points,
um,

1424
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:25,740
they lend themselves similarly to how
your hunting knife to sharpen

1425
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,290
differently from your chef's knife.
Like the chef's knife material's

1426
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:31,750
thinner,
but they're also sharpened at different

1427
01:05:31,751 --> 01:05:34,240
angles because they have different jobs
they're supposed to do.

1428
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,730
And so the broader essentially,
or sorry,

1429
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,940
the more acute that is,
the more easily that will break as well

1430
01:05:39,941 --> 01:05:41,980
as the thinner,
the thinner the material that,

1431
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:45,520
that,
that geometry is living on is more,

1432
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:48,760
uh,
susceptible to breaking that first image

1433
01:05:48,761 --> 01:05:52,090
that Jamie pulled up the geometry.
It looked like it was pretty robust.

1434
01:05:52,091 --> 01:05:53,470
Hold that up again.
Yeah.

1435
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,980
And as well as like,
it looks like it's probably at least 30

1436
01:05:56,981 --> 01:05:59,020
thousands of an inch thick,
which is,

1437
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,600
you know,
that's about if not more actually the

1438
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,580
original image,
Jamie,

1439
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:06,910
we see the actual broadhead in the um,
without the,

1440
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:09,430
um,
yeah,

1441
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:11,740
my friend Brian Stevens turned me onto
these.

1442
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:16,330
He,
he shot a bear through the head with one

1443
01:06:16,331 --> 01:06:21,331
of those genes from 10 feet away.
It was coming at him and he's got an

1444
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:27,340
image of the skull.
Then he sent me where you could see the

1445
01:06:27,341 --> 01:06:30,550
outline of that broad had through the
bear skull as crazy.

1446
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:33,640
Yeah.
And it and it killed the bear and didn't

1447
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:34,990
even fuck up the air.
I'm like,

1448
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,280
I believe it's crazy.
Yeah.

1449
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:39,910
And so a lot of like you see people
doing these incredible feats like

1450
01:06:39,911 --> 01:06:43,300
hammering through nails and shit like
that with their knives and like what the

1451
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:46,840
fuck?
The thing that most people are used to

1452
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:49,610
our chef's knife and they think that
they did that with their [inaudible] it

1453
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:54,620
up and 100% pretty much wood,
but with the right thickness coming up

1454
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:59,470
to the cutting edge as well as the
actual lead cutting edge geometry,

1455
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:03,010
like the actual angle that it sharpened
that you could do that shit all day

1456
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:03,280
long.

1457
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:08,280
Now when you sharpen a blade,
do you use something to hold it next to

1458
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:12,520
the stone so that it reaches the perfect
angle or do you do it by,

1459
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:13,750
I do buy,
I,

1460
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,790
I actually,
I feel handed it over to me.

1461
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,520
One of the things,
especially when I first started

1462
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:20,620
learning,
I would use my finger as a guide,

1463
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:25,900
so that would inform me as to the angle.
So when the edge of my finger would

1464
01:07:25,901 --> 01:07:29,140
touch the top of the stone that told me
that was about the right angle and then

1465
01:07:29,141 --> 01:07:30,790
when I flipped it over to do the other
side,

1466
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:35,470
I do the same thing with my thumb and
essentially experience.

1467
01:07:35,471 --> 01:07:39,550
I just know it from experience.
They do make a sharpening guides that

1468
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:43,030
you can clip on to the back of the
knives as well as little ramps.

1469
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:45,130
Those are all great,
especially if you're starting.

1470
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,450
The hardest part about all of this is
the muscle memory portion.

1471
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,720
It's figuring out how to lock in and
maintain that angle without wavering and

1472
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:57,610
placing your risks and all that kind of
shit and that just,

1473
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:00,040
it's,
it's like riding a bike or any other,

1474
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:03,970
anything you've ever had to learn in
your life with practice and repetition,

1475
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:05,590
you'll get better.
What do you think about that?

1476
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:07,870
Those machines,
so it's like little,

1477
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:11,770
they're like little linked through the
worst fucking thing ever.

1478
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,910
Really.
I have like almost kind of a conspiracy

1479
01:08:16,911 --> 01:08:21,380
theory that like the reality is they're
designed to destroy your knife so you

1480
01:08:21,381 --> 01:08:24,410
have to turn around and reinvest again
because most people,

1481
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:28,010
but one because of the knives aren't
usually sold for very much money that

1482
01:08:28,011 --> 01:08:32,980
are being used with those things.
And when you're not selling them for my

1483
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:36,380
very much,
you're relying on volume and what better

1484
01:08:36,381 --> 01:08:39,590
way than to create a thing that does the
job for a little bit,

1485
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:42,290
but ultimately destroys it and you have
to reinvest.

1486
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:44,570
What about those ones where you stick it
in the slot?

1487
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:49,400
It's the same kind of thing.
It's a little slower process,

1488
01:08:49,401 --> 01:08:51,830
but you,
you'll notice the problem with those,

1489
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:55,820
the real problem with those is that you
can't sharpen the whole edge.

1490
01:08:55,821 --> 01:09:00,650
You usually start at the heel or just a
little bit in front of the heel and then

1491
01:09:00,651 --> 01:09:03,290
you do the major work.
I tripped myself out.

1492
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:03,920
I was like,
fuck,

1493
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,310
I'm going to cut myself.
This is actually,

1494
01:09:05,311 --> 01:09:06,250
it's still pretty sure.
Oh,

1495
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,510
it's sharp as far.
Um,

1496
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:12,230
and so the problem is because you're not
getting the full length,

1497
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:16,610
you'll continue to dish this material
out just in front of the heel and then

1498
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:20,150
when you go to cut,
there's this little bit of shit there

1499
01:09:20,151 --> 01:09:22,730
that's not doing any work.
It's not doing anything.

1500
01:09:22,731 --> 01:09:25,130
Especially when you're relying on that
cutting board.

1501
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:27,260
When the knife comes down to the cutting
board to do some work,

1502
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:28,330
it's not happening.

1503
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,230
If I cut my lunch with that today,
nice.

1504
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:35,000
Oh fuck that.
Access that access have access deer and

1505
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:36,140
elk.
Oh my God,

1506
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,440
that was killing me.
That comment.

1507
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,670
I probably didn't say it,
but I was just like,

1508
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:42,050
Holy Shit.
That looks so fun.

1509
01:09:42,051 --> 01:09:42,730
Yeah,
man.

1510
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:44,810
You know.
Well I learned how to cook.

1511
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,170
I mean I,
I feel like there's some real art to

1512
01:09:48,171 --> 01:09:51,620
that as well from my friend Chad Ward,
whiskey ban,

1513
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:55,500
barbecue on instagram.
He's a lack a,

1514
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,140
a pitmaster like legit world champion
barbecue master.

1515
01:10:00,141 --> 01:10:04,760
And he's the one that taught me how to
cook slowly at low temperatures and then

1516
01:10:04,761 --> 01:10:08,750
sear it after you're done.
I always thought you supposed to just

1517
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:12,410
put it on high.
He cooked shit out of it and then eat

1518
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:12,960
it,
you know.

1519
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,500
Yeah.
I mean it tastes fine that way too,

1520
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:18,050
but you know,
when you're dealing with what I really

1521
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:22,040
had to learn,
especially in particular cooking with

1522
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:27,140
wild game is very unforgiving because
it's low in fat.

1523
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,220
Yeah.
It's got none.

1524
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,500
Yeah.
You're basically eating a sprinter.

1525
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,630
Here it is right there.
So that's the end.

1526
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:38,090
I have reverse sear it in a pan with
grass fed.

1527
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:39,350
But here that pain.
Beautiful.

1528
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:40,340
Listen to that sound.

1529
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:44,830
Oh,
oh,

1530
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:49,550
that's the last of my backdrop.
I gotta I gotta get some more meat.

1531
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,310
I eat.
I eat so much meat.

1532
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,420
It's crazy.
Yeah.

1533
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,190
Sue,
it was super healthy though,

1534
01:10:55,191 --> 01:10:57,140
bitch.
You fuck what you heard?

1535
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:00,680
Um,
it looks like it works.

1536
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:01,640
No,
well,

1537
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:02,870
you know what too?
There's,

1538
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:06,020
there's something really magical about
wild game and um,

1539
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,500
I don't know what the fuck it is.
I really don't and I don't think anybody

1540
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:11,990
does because I don't think there's
enough people out there that are eating

1541
01:11:11,991 --> 01:11:13,100
it,
but it has,

1542
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,190
it has a different effect

1543
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,850
on your body.
It feels different when I eat beef.

1544
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,790
Like if you have grass fed beef,
fuck,

1545
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:22,800
like total,
like pasture raised,

1546
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:24,300
like,
oh my God,

1547
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,270
the difference.
Do you know about butcher box?

1548
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,800
I am aware of it.
Yeah.

1549
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:30,120
Dude.
That companies the shit,

1550
01:11:30,121 --> 01:11:32,130
they'll,
they'll send it to your house.

1551
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,760
Frozen grass fed,
pasture raised,

1552
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:38,350
like in the pasture finished.
And uh,

1553
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:40,500
it's pretty cheap too.
It's a good deal.

1554
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:43,950
The few top sponsors of this podcast,
and I use them all the time.

1555
01:11:43,951 --> 01:11:45,570
I think it's amazing.
It's brilliant.

1556
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,170
You know,
and the few times that I,

1557
01:11:47,171 --> 01:11:50,280
and it's actually,
I feel embarrassed saying that I've only

1558
01:11:50,281 --> 01:11:52,740
eaten really good beef,
happy beef,

1559
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:54,600
essentially.
Only a few times.

1560
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,100
Yeah.
It's hard to,

1561
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:56,973
yeah.
Well,

1562
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,470
especially in some place.
Oh my God.

1563
01:11:58,471 --> 01:12:01,260
When you take a bite like that,
even just that first buy,

1564
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,530
it's just like,
it's a whole different world.

1565
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,430
And it's like,
what the fuck?

1566
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,080
Just the flavors.
Everything.

1567
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,710
I have my friend Mike Hawk Ridge,
uh,

1568
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:13,320
he lives up in British Columbia,
like the real,

1569
01:12:13,321 --> 01:12:15,630
but British Columbia look way the fuck
up there.

1570
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,610
And,
uh,

1571
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:18,540
you know,
he's a hunting guide and,

1572
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:19,680
um,
uh,

1573
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,380
uh,
got him some tickets for the fights in

1574
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:25,950
Vegas and he and his wife came down and
then afterwards we went out to eat and,

1575
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:27,060
uh,
they were eaten steak.

1576
01:12:27,061 --> 01:12:30,840
We ate at a restaurant and they were
laughing like they're used to eating

1577
01:12:30,841 --> 01:12:32,260
moose,
you know,

1578
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:36,180
like this beat is like,
it's like this poor little sick animal.

1579
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,180
It's all mushy.
You know,

1580
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:43,020
it's like if you eat a piece of wild
moose meat,

1581
01:12:43,021 --> 01:12:44,070
it's like,
whoa,

1582
01:12:44,071 --> 01:12:44,910
you eat it.
You're like,

1583
01:12:44,911 --> 01:12:48,760
Holy Shit.
It's like filled with flavor and it's

1584
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,780
just,
it feels like it gives you energy.

1585
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:54,420
It's crazy.
I would totally buy that.

1586
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:55,293
Yeah.
You'll,

1587
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:01,520
what does that people are trying to like
inject young people's blood into the

1588
01:13:01,701 --> 01:13:04,200
body is trying to make themselves feel
younger,

1589
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:06,960
like eating it,
putting good,

1590
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:11,220
well sourced.
Like those two things are now.

1591
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,110
Right.
I don't know if it's the same,

1592
01:13:13,111 --> 01:13:15,780
find out the same,
but I do think that there's,

1593
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:21,410
I mean there's gotta be something to
consuming and incredibly healthy,

1594
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:27,570
vibrant animal versus something that's
like raised in a cage.

1595
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:28,190
Right?
I mean,

1596
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:31,650
this just does just make sense,
but I don't think this is something that

1597
01:13:31,651 --> 01:13:33,050
you can,
I mean,

1598
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:38,070
they have absolutely measured protein
content and the protein contents off the

1599
01:13:38,071 --> 01:13:39,270
charts.
If you look at the difference in the

1600
01:13:39,271 --> 01:13:43,830
protein content of chicken or regular
beef versus Moose or elk,

1601
01:13:43,831 --> 01:13:46,830
it's much higher,
much denser and protein like,

1602
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:52,160
like I think something like six ounces
of acts as is 48 grams of protein.

1603
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,250
Right.
Which is incredible,

1604
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,360
you know.
Well,

1605
01:13:57,361 --> 01:14:02,250
it's interesting to think about that to
get to get that same amount of protein.

1606
01:14:02,251 --> 01:14:04,350
Like you don't have to gorge giant,
you just,

1607
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,330
yeah.
He's just eat that little bit.

1608
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,010
Yeah.
You're good little six ounce piece and

1609
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:10,230
you're good.
Even less if you want to stay in

1610
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:12,220
Ketosis.
If you're like in a kito diet,

1611
01:14:12,221 --> 01:14:13,900
you really need less than six ounces and
you know,

1612
01:14:13,901 --> 01:14:15,040
like three ounces.
Right.

1613
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,390
You know,
um,

1614
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:20,260
food is does to me as,
especially as I've gotten older,

1615
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:26,070
I've started doing a lot more cooking
and it becomes a different thing.

1616
01:14:26,201 --> 01:14:26,850
I'm,
I'm,

1617
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:29,110
it's not just,
I'm hungry and he stuffed my face.

1618
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,160
Right.
Like the,

1619
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:33,730
the preparing of food,
much like we were talking about with

1620
01:14:33,731 --> 01:14:37,630
craftsmanship,
like there's an art to making food and I

1621
01:14:37,631 --> 01:14:42,310
mean I'm by no means a chef,
but I can cook a few things really good,

1622
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:45,040
you know,
and I take great satisfaction that I

1623
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:46,240
fucking love it.
You know,

1624
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,980
I'll take,
my wife used to hate this,

1625
01:14:48,981 --> 01:14:52,460
but we would get home and we're like
more hungry.

1626
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:56,720
You gonna make some food.
Two hours later she's like,

1627
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,670
she's like,
yeah,

1628
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,070
a lot of people are that.
My brother's the same way.

1629
01:15:01,071 --> 01:15:03,650
Like I'm fucking hungry now.
I need to eat now.

1630
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:06,770
Rip Your fucking head off.
What would you need to set up some

1631
01:15:06,771 --> 01:15:10,350
cheese and some like Salami or,
so that's what I started doing,

1632
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,790
putting out some snack items while I'm
working.

1633
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:14,810
It's just relax.
Where,

1634
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:18,280
where like I could be starving.
I get done with a long ass day grind and

1635
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:19,990
I'll go home and I want to,
I like,

1636
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:22,550
I have this thing locked in my mind that
I want to eat.

1637
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:24,560
I'll take two hours to make the fucking
thing,

1638
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:27,350
even though I'm starving,
I haven't eaten since like one o'clock

1639
01:15:27,351 --> 01:15:29,150
in the afternoon.
It's nine o'clock at night.

1640
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:32,830
Do you find that as a person who is a
craftsman,

1641
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:35,380
an artisan,
that you try to have that approach with

1642
01:15:35,381 --> 01:15:38,710
like other things in your life too?
Like what you're talking just talking

1643
01:15:38,711 --> 01:15:40,300
about with like making food and,

1644
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,493
yeah,
sure.

1645
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:44,830
I mean,
I feel like I don't really think too

1646
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:47,680
much about the fact that I'm doing it
this way.

1647
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:52,681
It's just kind of the way I do things
and I'm a little bit more methodical and

1648
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:56,500
um,
I guess not necessarily more thoughtful

1649
01:15:56,501 --> 01:15:58,380
than anybody else.
Just like when I'm go to,

1650
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:01,150
when I approached these challenges or
these things they got to do,

1651
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:06,510
I take my time to do them right and try
to do them right the first time I used

1652
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:06,941
to,
uh,

1653
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:09,110
actually when I was working for Bob,
uh,

1654
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:14,050
we would have to mock up stuff or build
machines or six years or some shit like

1655
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:15,850
that.
And um,

1656
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,080
you know,
he was a very,

1657
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:20,650
his mindset was quick and dirty.
We got to do this,

1658
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,950
get this done as quick as possible.
And if it doesn't work the first time,

1659
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,740
we'll make some modifications and we'll
try it a second time.

1660
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:28,180
Still doesn't work,
sec time,

1661
01:16:28,181 --> 01:16:30,640
so and so forth.
So on and so forth until we got it

1662
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:33,580
right.
Where I would just think it through a

1663
01:16:33,581 --> 01:16:36,820
little bit more.
First Time it was all I need it.

1664
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:39,820
But I,
there was a long time,

1665
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:43,330
I used to do a lot of woodworking before
we got in the metal working and I was

1666
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:47,350
uh,
I always had to measure five times and

1667
01:16:47,351 --> 01:16:48,520
cut twice.
Right?

1668
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:50,830
Yeah.
And so I started getting to this point

1669
01:16:50,831 --> 01:16:53,440
where like,
I really had to think shit through

1670
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:57,250
because it's just,
to me it felt like a huge waste of time

1671
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:02,050
and energy and materials really to go
through all that process.

1672
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:04,880
And then,
so they had to be a long time long

1673
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:05,970
learning curve though,
right.

1674
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:09,980
Until like really learn how to,
especially I would imagine the aspect of

1675
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,900
it,
it's probably incredibly difficult.

1676
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:14,110
Well,
and when I was working for bomb,

1677
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:16,910
uh,
the only forging we did was a forging

1678
01:17:16,911 --> 01:17:19,580
the Damascus to make the patterns.
Um,

1679
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:22,550
and then we would like cut pleads out
and go from there.

1680
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:25,490
Uh,
I learned forging about five years ago.

1681
01:17:25,491 --> 01:17:29,960
Essentially.
I'm working with a gentleman named David

1682
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:32,120
[inaudible] who's also,
he's a master bladesmith.

1683
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:33,710
Uh,
he used to work in Seattle.

1684
01:17:33,711 --> 01:17:37,010
He's down in Olympia area now,
but he,

1685
01:17:37,011 --> 01:17:37,990
uh,
you know,

1686
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:41,900
he did,
he's a blacksmith by trade that got into

1687
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,450
knifemaking and he's fucking skill.
He's super talented,

1688
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,280
especially when it comes to the bowie
knives and hunters.

1689
01:17:46,281 --> 01:17:49,520
Like he doesn't really great work and
especially his Damascus patterns are

1690
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:53,480
really great.
But to watch somebody move and

1691
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:57,020
manipulate material and really,
like I said before,

1692
01:17:57,021 --> 01:18:01,070
like stock removal is a very valid way
of doing it because the cost of the

1693
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:03,200
actual materials,
um,

1694
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:07,400
is very small compared to the removal
stock removal.

1695
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:11,610
So earlier I was talking about taking a
bar and then cutting out the blade shape

1696
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,950
and then grind.
Yeah.

1697
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,530
Cause you're literally removing stock
from,

1698
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,150
from the,
from the starting the parent material.

1699
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,690
Would you take what's left and melt it
down?

1700
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:23,570
You could melt it down,
you could turn it and forge it into

1701
01:18:23,571 --> 01:18:25,220
other stuff.
Um,

1702
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:28,820
it's,
it's a really interesting practice.

1703
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:30,560
It's actually,
it's kind of like,

1704
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:32,650
you know,
people refer to yoga as a practice and

1705
01:18:32,651 --> 01:18:33,680
you know,
we're going to be perfect and like

1706
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:36,560
there's never going to be perfection
blade forging,

1707
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,110
but there's always an opportunity to
learn something and the practice it.

1708
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:43,700
And so when you see like you have a
decent little chunk,

1709
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:45,470
you know,
you start smashing on that thing and see

1710
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:48,110
what you can get out of it to economize
that material.

1711
01:18:48,111 --> 01:18:48,944
And again,
like I said,

1712
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:52,970
you don't really need to do that because
of how inexpensive material is.

1713
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:55,070
But if you think back like even a
hundred years,

1714
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:58,970
like this high quality material,
it's fucking expensive.

1715
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:01,850
You had to get the most out of it as you
possibly could.

1716
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:05,060
And so that's why forging with such a
big deal.

1717
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:08,960
And then as that price went down,
people change the way they manufactured

1718
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:12,500
just because then the time was the thing
that costs the most,

1719
01:19:12,501 --> 01:19:15,470
not the materials.
And so they turned around and made it

1720
01:19:15,471 --> 01:19:18,390
easier to manufacturer.
They didn't give a shit about the waste.

1721
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:22,340
Now how did you learn handled geometry?
Like the handle on this hunting knife.

1722
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:24,320
So yeah.
Yeah.

1723
01:19:24,321 --> 01:19:27,350
So you're asking him is very unique.
It is unique and actually,

1724
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:30,950
uh,
my hand perfectly fits in your hand know

1725
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,480
and that's,
that's the goal.

1726
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,860
A friend,
a friend refers to it as a,

1727
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:40,880
the knife shaking your hand back.
Like it fits so well.

1728
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:46,160
It feels like you're holding like shake
it for people that are just listening.

1729
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:50,570
Then there's an initial smoothness in
the front and then there's like this

1730
01:19:50,571 --> 01:19:54,740
little bump and then like a little step
the bottom and it just locks in your

1731
01:19:54,741 --> 01:19:59,741
hand and just feels perfect.
So I was inspired to do that by a maker

1732
01:19:59,871 --> 01:20:02,840
named Claude beauchamp.
He's a Belgian maker.

1733
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:04,700
Uh,
I first met him,

1734
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:07,790
odd
Claude Bosch,

1735
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:09,990
Bosch Chevy.
He is,

1736
01:20:09,991 --> 01:20:11,700
uh,
he's a Belgium maker.

1737
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:14,790
He at the first time I met him was at
blade show,

1738
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:18,240
which is a huge knife exposition.
It's the biggest one in the world that

1739
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:20,940
happens down in Atlanta every year.
The first weekend of June,

1740
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:25,680
he was my table neighbor and I had never
told him the story,

1741
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:29,610
but the first time I saw his knives I
was like the blades and everything

1742
01:20:29,611 --> 01:20:32,880
looked great but that the handle looks
fucking weird as shit.

1743
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:34,350
This handle.
Yeah,

1744
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:38,430
very similar to that handle cause his
has more of like a nice gentle curve

1745
01:20:38,431 --> 01:20:42,420
around to the end instead of kind of how
that one's kind of at a clip or an

1746
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:43,840
angle.
Um,

1747
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:47,550
and so finally,
like on the third day of the show,

1748
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:49,830
this really great maker that I look up
to,

1749
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,590
uh,
came over and he was just like doting

1750
01:20:52,591 --> 01:20:53,610
over clods work.

1751
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:54,390
And I was like,
all right,

1752
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:55,840
there must be something that,
and I have any,

1753
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:58,590
I feel like such an asshole.
Like I didn't even touch the stuff.

1754
01:20:58,591 --> 01:21:01,860
I was just looking at it and judging and
I picked it up and I was like,

1755
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:02,670
what?
It was,

1756
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:05,160
it was a totally like,
what the fuck?

1757
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:09,150
Because that same feeling that you have
when you're holding that,

1758
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:11,320
it feels perfect.
I was like it,

1759
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:16,420
it totally shifted my entire mindset and
paradigm around what I thought handle

1760
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:21,390
shapes should look and feel like.
And that has definitely inspired

1761
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:26,280
continued especially for like hard use
knives like especially like for a bigger

1762
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,260
blade,
like a Bush knife that you're trying to

1763
01:21:28,261 --> 01:21:33,261
chop through stuff with a handle like
that is going to benefit you immensely

1764
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:36,330
because it just,
it feels like a natural extension of

1765
01:21:36,331 --> 01:21:40,470
your hand.
And is this your your logo into the

1766
01:21:40,471 --> 01:21:40,800
bottles?

1767
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,940
My insignia.
So it's,

1768
01:21:41,941 --> 01:21:46,080
my name is Marco Mel Masiya.
It's two m's kind of swirling around

1769
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:48,510
each other and it looks kind of like a
flame dude.

1770
01:21:48,511 --> 01:21:50,400
I'm such a Dork for this shit.
I love it.

1771
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:55,110
So interesting man.
And then the handle too,

1772
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:58,440
there's something about the,
the handle being made out of Antler,

1773
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,710
like the Antler,
the feel that it has in your hand to the

1774
01:22:01,711 --> 01:22:05,210
organic materials,
organic especially uh,

1775
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:09,330
antler and bone.
They have this kind of like,

1776
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,490
I don't know if you've experienced it
with these,

1777
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,040
especially cutting up the like the
greasy meat,

1778
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:17,520
but from,
from my experience it does,

1779
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:20,430
it stays grippy.
It doesn't become super slippery or

1780
01:22:20,431 --> 01:22:24,230
anything I handle on my bow is actually
made out of antler.

1781
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:26,010
Yeah.
Had it custom made.

1782
01:22:26,011 --> 01:22:30,600
My friend John Dudley had these ones
made from a bull that he killed on

1783
01:22:30,601 --> 01:22:35,280
September 11 2001 like,
oh she has the nine 11 bull and he had

1784
01:22:35,281 --> 01:22:38,820
these handle's made out of the antlers
of this.

1785
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,130
And it does the way it sits in your
hand.

1786
01:22:41,131 --> 01:22:43,720
It's like it's got an,
even if you're sweaty or you know

1787
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:45,120
there's something,
you know,

1788
01:22:45,121 --> 01:22:47,190
it's rainy out,
it just has an extra grip to it.

1789
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,160
Well,
and especially something like that,

1790
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:53,130
like if you're skinning and breaking
down an animal and like it's important,

1791
01:22:53,131 --> 01:22:56,160
but it's not going to like,
it's not like one of those moments where

1792
01:22:56,161 --> 01:23:01,070
you relying on that grip for your life,
but when you do need that for your life,

1793
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:03,750
like you're trying to do,
or like you're digging in the ground,

1794
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:06,030
you're falling down the hillside and
you're trying to jab

1795
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,960
it and get it,
get a hold.

1796
01:23:07,961 --> 01:23:10,210
Like that's going to be really
important.

1797
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,130
But obviously that's a very rare,
uh,

1798
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,310
yeah,
incident when that one happened.

1799
01:23:15,311 --> 01:23:17,650
Well,
it's just something cool about it too.

1800
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:19,240
Well,
and just like the tactility.

1801
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,320
Yeah.
It's just,

1802
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:21,740
again,
it goes back to the,

1803
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,060
essentially the user experience.
Like what does it feel like?

1804
01:23:25,061 --> 01:23:27,250
How is it different?
Like it makes,

1805
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,800
it really does make a difference.
Yeah.

1806
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:32,860
And the,
one of the cool things to me also about

1807
01:23:32,861 --> 01:23:35,250
antlers is that they shed them,
you know,

1808
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:39,700
that they lose these things every year
and that every year they grow a new one.

1809
01:23:39,701 --> 01:23:43,720
Do you know that it's the fastest
growing organic material on earth?

1810
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:45,123
No,
I didn't know that.

1811
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:49,990
That shit right there,
that giant elk antler that grows in a

1812
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:54,130
couple of months,
I didn't know that falls off.

1813
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,620
Right.
They lose it after they're done running.

1814
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:59,520
So after they're done,
like they fell off and they just kind of

1815
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:01,690
immediately started,
like kind of slowly grow.

1816
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:04,630
They grow the whole thing back in a
couple months.

1817
01:24:04,631 --> 01:24:07,660
It's radical.
See if you find a video that shows,

1818
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:10,750
um,
elk antler growth,

1819
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:15,550
time lapse,
because it's crazy how fast it grows and

1820
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:17,380
it's all just for war.
I mean,

1821
01:24:17,381 --> 01:24:19,930
that's all that is.
It's to show off for the ladies.

1822
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:22,570
Hey,
and it's also for war.

1823
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:23,850
It's interesting,
dear.

1824
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:24,743
Yeah,
that guy,

1825
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:26,320
yeah,
Iraq.

1826
01:24:26,530 --> 01:24:28,990
Yeah.
He had that rack just so he could fuck

1827
01:24:28,991 --> 01:24:32,110
people up or fuck people,
but also elk.

1828
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:34,510
Yeah.
And definitely people you get close to

1829
01:24:34,511 --> 01:24:36,790
him.
Fuck me up.

1830
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,370
But look at that.
The following photos were taken about a

1831
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:43,300
week apart over a period.
Look at this April 1st I'll check this

1832
01:24:43,301 --> 01:24:44,020
out.
Watch.

1833
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,400
Just,
just have it play out there.

1834
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:48,150
It says a over four months,
they show the incredible girls.

1835
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:51,130
So April 1st watch.
This is like at a farm,

1836
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,190
a that looks like it is.
It looks like it's an elk farm.

1837
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,760
Just let it play out.
April 8th boom.

1838
01:24:57,761 --> 01:25:00,340
So seven days later,
look at that.

1839
01:25:00,341 --> 01:25:03,490
April 15th Bang.
Look how big that shit is.

1840
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,730
Oh Shit.

1841
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:10,780

1845
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,370
Glutton crazily material.
Yeah.

1846
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:27,660
May 25th June 4th right.
He's getting ready to go to war.

1847
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,370
Yeah.
June 10th he's thinking about Pussy.

1848
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,120
Look at that.
It's like now,

1849
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:35,980
now I'm thinking about supposed to be
June 17th I will fuck a dude up.

1850
01:25:35,981 --> 01:25:38,740
Comes near me.
June 24th look at that.

1851
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,090
And then July 1st that is crazy.
What the fuck?

1852
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,540
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

1853
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:47,440
And that's not even done.
July 8th July 15th now he's basically

1854
01:25:47,441 --> 01:25:51,580
still in velvet and then July 22nd that
looks hard.

1855
01:25:51,581 --> 01:25:53,680
Horn to me,
that looks like he shed his velvet.

1856
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:56,840
And then July 29th isn't that nuts?
Bizarre.

1857
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:00,190
So by the time August rolls around,
they're ripe right now,

1858
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:04,400
beginning of September there in hard
horned and they'll go to war and they'll

1859
01:26:04,401 --> 01:26:06,080
keep that shit for,
you know,

1860
01:26:06,081 --> 01:26:08,720
till the end of December.
Probably December I think.

1861
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:13,640
Maybe January and then they'll,
they'll lose it and then they lose the

1862
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:16,080
fastest growing organic material.
Yes.

1863
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,780
By volume.
Weight,

1864
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:18,820
yes.
Okay.

1865
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,140
Yeah,
I think by all those things,

1866
01:26:21,141 --> 01:26:23,510
because it grows so fast,
it's so heavy.

1867
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:26,210
I mean that's like 40 pounds.
Just have antlers.

1868
01:26:26,211 --> 01:26:28,790
Yeah.
And it grows over a couple months.

1869
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:30,650
Yeah.
It's fucking nuts man.

1870
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:33,620
This scene picture on,
I made that up about the fastest growing

1871
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:35,210
organic material,
but I think it's true.

1872
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:36,381
I'm looking at,
it says,

1873
01:26:36,381 --> 01:26:38,390
uh,
the first fun fact I found it,

1874
01:26:38,391 --> 01:26:41,840
they can grow 10 pounds of velvet per
year.

1875
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,270
That's just the valve.
Just the velvet.

1876
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,133
Yeah.

1877
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:46,763
Hmm.

1878
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:48,300
Yeah.
But that's probably because a,

1879
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:49,510
it's a velvet farm,
you know,

1880
01:26:49,511 --> 01:26:51,460
they use that stuff for human growth
hormone.

1881
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,180
I got a lot of baseball players were
taking on a shit.

1882
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:56,110
Yeah.
A friend of mine,

1883
01:26:56,111 --> 01:26:58,540
my friend John Rivet shout out to Johnny
Ribot,

1884
01:26:58,870 --> 01:27:03,550
he lives in Alberta in his,
one of his friends had an elk farm up

1885
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:07,150
there in Alberta and he grew elk non for
the meat,

1886
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:11,890
but for the um,
for the velvet because that stuff that

1887
01:27:11,891 --> 01:27:14,710
grows,
grows so fast and it's so,

1888
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,830
so ridiculously potent that they would
take,

1889
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:20,830
uh,
antler velvet and they were turning into

1890
01:27:20,831 --> 01:27:24,850
a spray that would equal the effects of
human growth hormone.

1891
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,670
How could you do that?
Crossing me?

1892
01:27:27,671 --> 01:27:28,810
She's like,
I don't know,

1893
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,430
but athletes,
we're taking it,

1894
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:34,360
athletes are taking this stuff and it
was having this just for like growth

1895
01:27:34,361 --> 01:27:38,110
hormone reaction in their body aches and
like know it sounds like it's

1896
01:27:38,111 --> 01:27:40,330
superficial son.
He'll get it.

1897
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:44,150
Isn't that applied superficially or they
like score?

1898
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:46,780
No,
I'm too stupid to be answering your

1899
01:27:46,781 --> 01:27:48,190
questions.
But um,

1900
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:51,470
there's something about deer velvet that
was a for him,

1901
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,200
you know,
I don't even know if it worked,

1902
01:27:53,530 --> 01:27:55,720
but it was a big thing in the,
uh,

1903
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:59,170
the supplement and fitness industry that
people are getting deer velvet.

1904
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:04,390
The new vibe bought it that you spray it
and it's supposed to give you a growth

1905
01:28:04,391 --> 01:28:05,224
hormone.

1906
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:09,940
Would you think of that only beard?
Did you have your hand only been before?

1907
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:10,481
Yeah,
I have.

1908
01:28:10,481 --> 01:28:11,170
It's great.
Yeah,

1909
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:12,910
it's great.
Olympia?

1910
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:14,230
Yeah.
Is this from Olympia,

1911
01:28:14,231 --> 01:28:15,310
Washington?
Is that what it is?

1912
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:16,720
Uh,
originally.

1913
01:28:16,721 --> 01:28:18,970
Yeah.
It think it's brewed in Milwaukee.

1914
01:28:18,971 --> 01:28:20,530
Now.
What the fuck?

1915
01:28:20,531 --> 01:28:22,660
I know everything's being sourced
overseas.

1916
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:24,410
I mean what,
um,

1917
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:25,270
your,
uh,

1918
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:28,330
from the Pacific northwest,
but now you live in Connecticut.

1919
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:31,420
The state I shit on the most,
this is a whole video out there of me

1920
01:28:31,421 --> 01:28:34,000
shitting on Connecticut.
Like people have made a compilation of

1921
01:28:34,001 --> 01:28:34,381
me,
Shit.

1922
01:28:34,381 --> 01:28:35,214
Oh,
can I shoot?

1923
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:37,570
I'm sure plenty of it's warranted.
Yeah.

1924
01:28:37,571 --> 01:28:41,170
There's all of it.
Shout out to my good friend Tommy Junior

1925
01:28:41,171 --> 01:28:42,770
and lived in Connecticut.
Yeah,

1926
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:43,960
I finally found it.
So,

1927
01:28:43,961 --> 01:28:46,090
uh,
I think it's just antlers in general

1928
01:28:46,091 --> 01:28:48,760
are,
are the fastest growing tissue and an

1929
01:28:48,761 --> 01:28:50,000
Annie Mammo.
Yeah.

1930
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:53,080
And then she,
Elk Antler is the fastest growing out of

1931
01:28:53,081 --> 01:28:56,890
all of them because it's the largest,
so it grows in the same amount of time

1932
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,920
that the deer would grow its antlers,
but it's far larger.

1933
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:01,430
You know,
like,

1934
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:04,020
like if that was been more mass than a,
than a Moose,

1935
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:05,760
uh,
no,

1936
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:08,220
no dear.
Would be big Musubi where some Moose,

1937
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:10,500
cause my are here.
They're the biggest,

1938
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:14,010
they're the biggest of all of the deer
species.

1939
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:15,990
Like by far,
you know,

1940
01:29:15,991 --> 01:29:20,991
I think like a full grown Yukon Moose
could be as much as 2000 pounds.

1941
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:27,950
A really big rocky mountain elk under
normal circumstances is like a fucking

1942
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:33,810
giant one is pushing a thousand genes.
It's a giant though.

1943
01:29:33,811 --> 01:29:38,811
That'd be like a 400 inch bull like that
one that's out for the,

1944
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:42,300
the inches.
The measurement of the size of the

1945
01:29:42,301 --> 01:29:45,180
inches of the antler like that.
Do you see that one that's in the front?

1946
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:47,100
That's considerably bigger than this
one.

1947
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:49,650
That was the one out in the front is 382
inches.

1948
01:29:49,651 --> 01:29:53,130
That's a giant bull chasing.
That fucker was about a thousand pounds.

1949
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,110
He was huge.

1950
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:57,420
Huge.
Moose.

1951
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,300
Moose is twice as big.
Hips would see that thing go.

1952
01:30:00,301 --> 01:30:01,320
Shut the fuck up,
bitch.

1953
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:05,130
I got to go.
And they just start running for Moose.

1954
01:30:05,131 --> 01:30:05,790
They,
they're,

1955
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:08,550
the weird thing about a moose is their
antlers or like a door,

1956
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:12,240
you know,
it's basically like they're so fat

1957
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:14,520
thing.
It's not like pokey mean.

1958
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:17,790
They're basically like they're hitting
each other in the head with doors.

1959
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,250
Right?
They're like big old gloves and,

1960
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:22,020
but you seen,
have you seen,

1961
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:24,220
I've seen a few pictures where the,
especially the Moose there,

1962
01:30:24,221 --> 01:30:29,221
the antlers get locked up and they're
fucking stuck more deer than Moose.

1963
01:30:30,311 --> 01:30:33,480
Yeah.
Because the design of a moose antlers is

1964
01:30:33,481 --> 01:30:35,220
like,
it's not as intertwined.

1965
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:38,190
But with deer it happens all the time
because there's a little bit of flex to

1966
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:41,910
the bone.
And so the clash and in the force of the

1967
01:30:41,911 --> 01:30:44,250
two of them slamming each other,
they get stuck.

1968
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,100
CTE Will they drown?
Oh Gee.

1969
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:49,770
They've,
they've fought like that and then,

1970
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,960
you know,
wrestled and wound up in the water and

1971
01:30:51,961 --> 01:30:56,961
one up drowning does a horrible video.
I saw of two deer that got stuck in one

1972
01:30:58,051 --> 01:31:02,460
of them got killed by a coyote.
Not just get a whole pack of them torn

1973
01:31:02,461 --> 01:31:05,010
to shreds.
It tore him and they eat them.

1974
01:31:05,011 --> 01:31:07,860
Asshole first,
as I've documented many times in this

1975
01:31:07,861 --> 01:31:08,990
podcast.
Um,

1976
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:11,280
it's like a lot of animals do go for the
buck first.

1977
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:12,270
Well,
yeah.

1978
01:31:12,271 --> 01:31:14,520
Lions do.
A lot of them do.

1979
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:16,350
Yeah.
I don't know what that's all about.

1980
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:17,820
Um,
but the,

1981
01:31:17,821 --> 01:31:22,350
um,
the one deer was still attached to his

1982
01:31:22,351 --> 01:31:27,150
dead friend and uh,
these hunters had to help it get

1983
01:31:27,151 --> 01:31:31,770
released and they saw one of the antlers
off the other deer is dead deer and

1984
01:31:31,771 --> 01:31:33,690
fried it.
And then this other one ran off.

1985
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:35,730
Like what a nightmare that guys lived
through.

1986
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:36,810
Right.
You know his buddy,

1987
01:31:36,811 --> 01:31:40,440
it's his ass hole torn apart.
They literally eating him alive while he

1988
01:31:40,441 --> 01:31:42,120
stuck to the guy.
Oh my God.

1989
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:43,170
Probably fight.
Yeah,

1990
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:46,920
I have him as well kicking in and it
could he be trying to talk about,

1991
01:31:46,921 --> 01:31:49,560
could have easily been you.
I mean literally could have easily been

1992
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:50,790
yet.
There's two dear.

1993
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,470
One of them gets eaten alive and the
other one's just sitting there like,

1994
01:31:54,530 --> 01:31:59,380
like living with the horror of his and
then these people come over and he can't

1995
01:31:59,381 --> 01:32:00,910
get away from the fucking people.
And it's like,

1996
01:32:00,911 --> 01:32:02,950
these people are gonna eat me and they
don't even eat them.

1997
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:08,010
They let them go and they're hunters.
They freed him up and let me lose crazy.

1998
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:09,940
Yeah,
you got that.

1999
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:13,940
Oh,
there's one that elk got stuck with a

2000
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:14,860
dead elk.

2001
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:18,480
That's a dead elk.
That's an elk head that stuck on this

2002
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:20,080
other elks.
But see,

2003
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:24,640
I don't know what that was.
That to me makes me think that that

2004
01:32:24,641 --> 01:32:29,641
could have very easily been like an elk,
found a dead elk and just started head

2005
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:32,480
butting in and ripped his head off and
got stuck with them.

2006
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:35,400
They kill each other all the time right
now.

2007
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:38,380
I mean all the time.
Oh Geez.

2008
01:32:38,381 --> 01:32:39,760
Look at those racks,
dude.

2009
01:32:39,761 --> 01:32:42,760
When you hear them fighting,
like one of the first times I ever went

2010
01:32:42,761 --> 01:32:45,940
elk hunting,
we were coming over this hill and it

2011
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:49,450
sounded like two dudes slam and baseball
bands together.

2012
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:51,460
Just crack,
crack,

2013
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:52,900
crack,
crack.

2014
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:54,760
And when we came over the top of the
hill,

2015
01:32:54,761 --> 01:32:59,761
these two giant elk were just running at
each other and smashing each other.

2016
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:03,310
It was a magical day.
It was like one of the first times I

2017
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:04,150
ever elk hunted.

2018
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:08,110
And there's a thing that happens when
you hit a peak rut and when the peak

2019
01:33:08,111 --> 01:33:11,230
rudd happens,
they just go crazy all around you.

2020
01:33:11,231 --> 01:33:16,231
They're all screaming and it might only
happen once in a season and you just,

2021
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:19,810
if you might be there for that couple
hours when it all goes down,

2022
01:33:19,811 --> 01:33:22,180
what's insanity?
Insanity.

2023
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:24,760
There's all around you screaming and
head butting each other.

2024
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:27,520
I can't even imagine him walking over
the top of the hill and it's like

2025
01:33:27,521 --> 01:33:30,040
fucking stumbling across are so
vulnerable.

2026
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:34,690
First one,
I got a tree and they're screaming

2027
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,650
and they're so big,
man.

2028
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:40,010
It's,
it's a screen.

2029
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:44,080
There's two going at it right there and
you hear him,

2030
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,430
they just clash and slamming each other.
Oh yeah,

2031
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:50,670
you hear that?
It's

2032
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:54,880
the boy dog.
Fuck man.

2033
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:58,870
And they don't even know he's alive
right now and they kill each other all

2034
01:33:58,871 --> 01:34:01,510
the time.
But the hormones they got going on.

2035
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:04,480
It's like,
I don't give a fuck about anything else.

2036
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:07,960
Yeah.
My friend Cam came across one last year

2037
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:10,120
and uh,
he crept up on it.

2038
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:14,530
He thought it was bedded and he shot it
with an Arrow and it didn't move.

2039
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:15,910
And he's like,
what the fuck?

2040
01:34:15,911 --> 01:34:18,750
And he got over to it.
It was already dead and another elk,

2041
01:34:18,751 --> 01:34:22,060
it stabbed it.
They stabbed through the heart and it

2042
01:34:22,061 --> 01:34:23,870
laid down and died.
Right.

2043
01:34:23,871 --> 01:34:25,280
It happens all the time.
They are,

2044
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:27,940
they're always finding them that other
other elk have murdered.

2045
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:29,890
They don't crazy.
Fuck.

2046
01:34:29,891 --> 01:34:33,610
They just trying to get that policy.
So I to get the pose,

2047
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:36,110
how much does it right?
Is that a monster?

2048
01:34:36,111 --> 01:34:37,300
A month?
Just a month.

2049
01:34:37,301 --> 01:34:39,670
Maybe a little bit longer.
There's a second rut.

2050
01:34:39,671 --> 01:34:42,110
Sometimes in October when a another
female,

2051
01:34:42,111 --> 01:34:45,190
we'll go into estrus and they'll resume
the Rut.

2052
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:47,770
Yeah.
It's magical times.

2053
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:50,260
Yeah.
I can't even imagine stumbled across

2054
01:34:50,261 --> 01:34:51,310
that.
It's pretty cool,

2055
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:52,810
man.
It's pretty cool.

2056
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,400
You know the,
the real wild,

2057
01:34:54,401 --> 01:34:57,350
the actual real wild.
Well you are in Connecticut,

2058
01:34:57,351 --> 01:34:58,820
man.
You've got to worry about two things.

2059
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,070
Hitting a deer with your car and lyme
disease.

2060
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:02,750
The lime dust.
Okay.

2061
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:06,530
So that's something that we didn't
realize we were moving into.

2062
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:07,980
Oh Man,

2063
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:09,930
I wish,
I wish I told you because you and I were

2064
01:35:09,931 --> 01:35:11,850
going back and forth when you were about
to move,

2065
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:12,621
right?
Yeah.

2066
01:35:12,621 --> 01:35:14,210
That was definitely one of the things
that,

2067
01:35:14,211 --> 01:35:15,021
uh,
we're like,

2068
01:35:15,021 --> 01:35:15,854
wait,
what?

2069
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:17,460
They're everywhere and you got to him

2070
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,520
everywhere.
Ticks,

2071
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:22,310
and if you're listening to this anywhere
in the east coast,

2072
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:25,790
um,
especially New York has got it really

2073
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:27,950
bad.
I mean there's a lyme disease map and

2074
01:35:27,951 --> 01:35:30,560
you see like the instances of lyme
disease and the east coast.

2075
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:34,880
It's horrific man.
And I know fucking at least a dozen

2076
01:35:34,881 --> 01:35:37,080
people that have it and it stays with
you for life.

2077
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,810
Yeah.
And my friend Jim Miller,

2078
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,340
uh,
he's a guy who fights in the UFC.

2079
01:35:40,341 --> 01:35:43,130
He's got to take a giant fistful of
pills every day.

2080
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:47,810
I mean he's got it real bad,
real bad and he's still fighting,

2081
01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:49,190
still fighting in the UFC

2082
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:51,670
and those deer too.
I've been worried about actually when

2083
01:35:51,671 --> 01:35:52,840
we,
especially when we were moving out

2084
01:35:52,841 --> 01:35:55,270
because I was driving through
Pennsylvania,

2085
01:35:55,720 --> 01:36:00,720
I hit Pennsylvania at like we drove
cross country at sunset and drove from

2086
01:36:01,331 --> 01:36:05,380
there all the way to Connecticut and
dark and all I could think is like,

2087
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:08,230
I'm going to fucking hit a deer.
You see so many of them.

2088
01:36:08,231 --> 01:36:10,930
Right?
You see so many dead ones on the side of

2089
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:13,150
the fucking room.
Blows my mind.

2090
01:36:13,450 --> 01:36:18,450
But the biggest issue has been actually
other Connecticut drivers is the big,

2091
01:36:19,841 --> 01:36:23,560
the biggest concern.
My wife and I both have been t boned in

2092
01:36:23,561 --> 01:36:26,260
the last eight months.
People in Connecticut just,

2093
01:36:26,261 --> 01:36:29,050
they're just given up man.
This hitting the gas and closing her

2094
01:36:29,051 --> 01:36:29,884
eyes.
Well,

2095
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:32,590
what's crazy is like I've driven,
I've driven an la,

2096
01:36:32,591 --> 01:36:35,740
I've driven in New York,
I've driven in fucking Oregon,

2097
01:36:35,741 --> 01:36:37,540
seattle,
all kinds of crazy places,

2098
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:42,690
but they all have like a culture about
how they work and I could not figure out

2099
01:36:43,601 --> 01:36:47,410
Connecticut.
And a friend finally explained it to me.

2100
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:51,910
He said,
they're driving as if nobody else is on

2101
01:36:51,911 --> 01:36:52,571
the road.
I was like,

2102
01:36:52,571 --> 01:36:54,100
Holy Shit,
that makes perfect sense.

2103
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:58,870
The w the choices they make are as if
nobody else is there.

2104
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:02,470
I'll be coming up in the passing lane.
So when he's in the lane to the right of

2105
01:37:02,471 --> 01:37:04,150
me,
there's no exits coming up.

2106
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:06,460
There's no other cars for like half a
mile.

2107
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:09,340
I'm cruising probably like five,
10 miles faster than them.

2108
01:37:09,730 --> 01:37:12,430
They changed lanes right in front of me.
Why?

2109
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:13,703
Why,
why?

2110
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:16,080
Because like say if you,
um,

2111
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:17,580
you're,
let's,

2112
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:21,060
let's say there's a thing that you're
making like in a poxy,

2113
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:22,650
right?
When you're making an epoxy,

2114
01:37:22,651 --> 01:37:25,110
there's several ingredients that you
have to add to it.

2115
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:30,800
Or maybe that's not the best example.
Like say maybe there's a electronics,

2116
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,750
just whatever it is that you're,
you're,

2117
01:37:33,810 --> 01:37:38,810
you're making say so if you're making a
thing and it requires 10 different

2118
01:37:40,021 --> 01:37:43,860
ingredients,
if you are a person in Connecticut,

2119
01:37:43,861 --> 01:37:46,050
you have eight ingredients,
you don't have those other two and you

2120
01:37:46,051 --> 01:37:48,840
just do without,
without you just deal with it.

2121
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:53,280
You just missing two things and you just
hit the gas and just drive places and no

2122
01:37:53,281 --> 01:37:55,980
one knows what they're doing.
And this is a real state.

2123
01:37:57,210 --> 01:38:00,090
It's just not well.
And what's also bonkers that we weren't

2124
01:38:00,091 --> 01:38:03,690
expecting is that like,
unless you're driving 15 to 20 miles

2125
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:06,870
over the speed limit,
you're going too slow or,

2126
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:08,760
uh,
like a stoplight.

2127
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:14,090
And stop signs are suggestion.
People used right or left,

2128
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,940
left where they're going.
Where are they going?

2129
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:20,490
They don't under the state so small,
you could drive through the state and

2130
01:38:20,491 --> 01:38:23,100
demand and a half hours,
all sorts of stuff.

2131
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:25,470
They just,
they're so confused now and I'm not

2132
01:38:25,471 --> 01:38:27,510
trying to sit here and shit on fucking
Connecticut,

2133
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:32,370
but it's just,
it's just that those things haven't been

2134
01:38:32,371 --> 01:38:35,160
a serious culture shock for us.
Despair,

2135
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:37,110
despair.
He hit the gas.

2136
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:39,720
What's crazy is it's a fucking beautiful
state,

2137
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:43,830
especially in the summer.
I'm terrifying trying to drive around

2138
01:38:43,831 --> 01:38:47,010
that time out of your car.
You get bit by a thousand ticks and you

2139
01:38:47,011 --> 01:38:49,410
fucking can't walk anymore.
The humidity too.

2140
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:51,570
I was not expecting that.
Great on your balls,

2141
01:38:51,571 --> 01:38:53,970
right.
Ball sweat.

2142
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,770
Yesterday I was in my shop.
I wasn't doing shit.

2143
01:38:55,771 --> 01:38:58,320
Like I could have just been sitting here
and like fiddling around with,

2144
01:38:58,410 --> 01:39:02,340
I was sweating my ass off
every,

2145
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:03,460
I was just like,
yeah,

2146
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:05,400
mine isn't coast Florida.

2147
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,420
What the hell?
Yeah.

2148
01:39:06,421 --> 01:39:07,800
Well you're used to,
uh,

2149
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:12,600
you know that Pacific northwest doesn't
really get that hot and the summers are

2150
01:39:12,601 --> 01:39:15,780
glorious.
Like Seattle and war against summers.

2151
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:17,280
God,
they're glorious.

2152
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:20,270
Everything's fucking neon green.
Oh.

2153
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:22,320
And the sun comes out.
It's amazing.

2154
01:39:22,321 --> 01:39:26,280
It's almost almost makes up for the
winter,

2155
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:30,060
but not quite the lack of winter.
Well,

2156
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:33,210
just the rain,
just the rain stopped raining.

2157
01:39:33,211 --> 01:39:34,440
There is a winner.
It's just,

2158
01:39:34,441 --> 01:39:36,450
it's not,
it's not frozen.

2159
01:39:36,451 --> 01:39:38,100
It's tempered,
but it's just temporary.

2160
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:40,430
Just crazy.
Yeah.

2161
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,240
And Do,
and you're like,

2162
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:43,800
I could do this.
I can hang in there.

2163
01:39:43,801 --> 01:39:45,180
And then the summer comes you like,
hey,

2164
01:39:45,181 --> 01:39:47,190
it's going to be fine.
But like a,

2165
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:50,490
like a beaten wife waiting for your
husband to come home and you're like,

2166
01:39:50,491 --> 01:39:52,020
hey,
he's not home now and I've got a great

2167
01:39:52,021 --> 01:39:53,580
house.
But he's coming home.

2168
01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:55,350
He's coming home.
He's going to be home for eight months.

2169
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:57,570
Yeah.
Just going to piss on your hair for

2170
01:39:57,571 --> 01:40:02,571
eight months,
eight months of clouds and fucking craft

2171
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:06,300
beers and just everybody's shooting
themselves.

2172
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:11,250
It's dark up there,
man.

2173
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:13,380
I don't think people are meant to live
like that.

2174
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:14,940
I mean,
I think it's gorgeous and there's

2175
01:40:14,941 --> 01:40:17,010
benefits to it for sure.
But,

2176
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:18,060
uh,
I had a buddy of mine,

2177
01:40:18,061 --> 01:40:19,380
he tried to convince me to live up
there.

2178
01:40:19,381 --> 01:40:20,970
It's hilarious.
My friend Salami,

2179
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:22,890
he moved to Portland.
That's his name.

2180
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:24,690
Okay.
He tried to move to Portland.

2181
01:40:25,030 --> 01:40:27,630
I mean he did move to Portland.
He's teaching Jujitsu up there.

2182
01:40:27,631 --> 01:40:28,141
It's like,
dude,

2183
01:40:28,141 --> 01:40:31,080
I love and it's fucking great up here.
It's fucking amazing.

2184
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,730
I go,
you don't mind about the winner.

2185
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:34,680
You don't mind about the rain goes,
no.

2186
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:35,481
He goes,
dude,

2187
01:40:35,481 --> 01:40:39,360
the people are so fucking cool.
The restaurants are amazing and the

2188
01:40:39,361 --> 01:40:42,150
summers are so good.
Three years later he's back in La.

2189
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:42,781
I go,
what happened?

2190
01:40:42,781 --> 01:40:43,501
He goes,
I couldn't do it,

2191
01:40:43,501 --> 01:40:44,850
man.
Couldn't do it anymore.

2192
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,160
I go,
ah,

2193
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:48,180
I see.
So it's a thing.

2194
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:51,270
It's like you hang in there for as long
as you can,

2195
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:53,680
but you can't hang in there forever.
That what it is.

2196
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,470
But some people can.
I can hang.

2197
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:57,460
I've,
you know,

2198
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:58,570
a lot of people have,
what is it,

2199
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:01,270
seasonal depression syndrome or some
shit.

2200
01:41:01,271 --> 01:41:03,910
Like it's cause you grew up there?
I don't think so.

2201
01:41:03,911 --> 01:41:06,760
Cause my sister and my mom both grew up
there too.

2202
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:09,630
My wife even the hate it,
they,

2203
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:13,030
especially the winter time,
the wintertime when it is that dark

2204
01:41:13,031 --> 01:41:14,500
gray,
like it doesn't snow,

2205
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:17,290
it just rains.
It just gets dark.

2206
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:19,810
I guess.
I think part of my issue is,

2207
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:22,060
like I said,
I always worked in restaurants or in

2208
01:41:22,061 --> 01:41:23,530
Phuket,
and we're in a shop,

2209
01:41:23,531 --> 01:41:27,190
so it's like I'm in a virtual cave all
the fucking time,

2210
01:41:27,191 --> 01:41:31,660
so I'm not experiencing that except for
the drive home or to work.

2211
01:41:32,330 --> 01:41:36,100
Wasn't Jamie just said sad as I was
looking up seasonal effective disorder.

2212
01:41:36,101 --> 01:41:38,830
That's the acronym they give is sad.
Sad.

2213
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:39,970
It's,
that's what it is.

2214
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:45,010
I mean,
they probably called it that on purpose.

2215
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:47,230
I mean,
I don't think they needed to call it

2216
01:41:47,231 --> 01:41:51,100
seasonal affective disorder.
That's not the best feel like shit

2217
01:41:51,101 --> 01:41:53,590
because of the rain disease.
Well,

2218
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:56,830
something isn't it?
Something about like the lack of vitamin

2219
01:41:57,220 --> 01:41:59,290
D felt light.
I'll tell you what though.

2220
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:03,940
There's light therapy.
I'll take it over Connecticut all day.

2221
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:06,310
I'll take Seattle over Connecticut.

2222
01:42:06,510 --> 01:42:09,780
Oh,
all day.

2223
01:42:09,810 --> 01:42:11,880
You know what I dream about it sometimes
is Denver.

2224
01:42:11,881 --> 01:42:14,540
Even Connecticut.
I lived in Denver for only a few,

2225
01:42:14,970 --> 01:42:18,180
a few months.
People that live in Connecticut right

2226
01:42:18,181 --> 01:42:18,541
now.
I go,

2227
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:19,740
what the fuck,
dude?

2228
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:22,470
I actually running gag folks.
I don't really care.

2229
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:26,970
When we first moved in Denver.
Denver's fucking beautiful.

2230
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:29,100
Fucking love Denver.
Love it.

2231
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:30,443
Love it.
What was,

2232
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:32,040
uh,
when I first moved there,

2233
01:42:32,041 --> 01:42:34,500
I thought I would,
so I grew up in Washington right at the

2234
01:42:34,501 --> 01:42:38,550
base of the puget sound water around me.
I actually used to sail on a racing team

2235
01:42:38,551 --> 01:42:39,361
and stuff like that.
I was like,

2236
01:42:39,361 --> 01:42:42,030
wow,
I'm going to miss the water so much and

2237
01:42:42,031 --> 01:42:44,370
it's so green too.
I got there and I was like,

2238
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:47,250
I don't think I care about the water.
I care about the green.

2239
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:51,030
But the second the spring rains hit,
everything turned green.

2240
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:52,530
All the trees started blossoming.

2241
01:42:52,530 --> 01:42:53,640
I was like,
Holy Shit.

2242
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:56,760
And it was beautiful.
Beautiful.

2243
01:42:57,660 --> 01:43:02,390
The only thing I hated about Denver,
everybody had a fucking dog and nobody

2244
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,040
cleaned up the dog shit.
Oh,

2245
01:43:04,041 --> 01:43:06,000
that's fine.
That was the everywhere.

2246
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:08,590
Lazy bitches.
I just didn't understand it.

2247
01:43:10,490 --> 01:43:11,670
It's probably worse now.
The other hand,

2248
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:14,700
the free pot,
all the legal pot to everywhere.

2249
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:17,670
But you know what?
What it has that's amazing,

2250
01:43:17,671 --> 01:43:19,260
man,
is the view of the mountains.

2251
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:22,860
There's something about being right
there and seeing those rockies that just

2252
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:25,110
humbles you.
It puts it in perspective.

2253
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:27,900
So that's what,
that's what being in puget sounds like

2254
01:43:27,901 --> 01:43:30,120
as well because you always got Mount
Rainier.

2255
01:43:31,110 --> 01:43:32,490
It's crazy.
Like the road,

2256
01:43:32,491 --> 01:43:35,690
the cities were engineered so like
you're coming up and down hills and like

2257
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:37,530
boom,
the fucking mountain.

2258
01:43:37,531 --> 01:43:39,060
That's right.
And it's a monster.

2259
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:40,910
Mount Rainier is a monster.
Yeah.

2260
01:43:40,911 --> 01:43:41,970
That's amazing man.
We went,

2261
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,940
I'm looking for big foot up there once
man,

2262
01:43:43,950 --> 01:43:44,880
dog and yeah.

2263
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:46,651
Yeah,
we found him.

2264
01:43:46,651 --> 01:43:48,490
We just didn't want to tell anybody.
Um,

2265
01:43:48,630 --> 01:43:49,171
that,
yeah,

2266
01:43:49,171 --> 01:43:53,600
that area too is so wooded.
It's really incredible when you go

2267
01:43:53,601 --> 01:43:55,220
walking through the woods,
like there's,

2268
01:43:55,230 --> 01:43:58,940
you don't make any sound when you walk,
you don't leave any footprints because

2269
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:03,941
it's just like feet thick of pine
needles and the models.

2270
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:08,990
This is so soft and it's interesting and
lush and filled with elk manners,

2271
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:11,960
elk everywhere up there.
And like they run,

2272
01:44:11,961 --> 01:44:14,900
they're run like 30 feet and you can't
see him anymore because there's just

2273
01:44:14,901 --> 01:44:18,130
like so many tree fucking guy.
My inlaws,

2274
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:20,810
they live south of Olympia and they have
16,

2275
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:23,660
16 acres out there.
And,

2276
01:44:23,661 --> 01:44:25,940
uh,
like three or I think it's like four or

2277
01:44:25,941 --> 01:44:29,210
five that are like clear for like a
field and a barn and the house and

2278
01:44:29,211 --> 01:44:30,750
stuff.
Rest of it's all wood.

2279
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:33,500
And then they got black bears that
cruise through.

2280
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:36,650
Their large cats are like podcasts and
links and shit.

2281
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:38,690
Uh,
and elk for sure.

2282
01:44:38,691 --> 01:44:41,630
And they have an orchard and the elk are
just up there standing on their handmade

2283
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:45,170
eating that shit up.
They're beautiful.

2284
01:44:45,171 --> 01:44:46,850
The coolest watch too.
Yeah,

2285
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:47,421
that's,
I mean,

2286
01:44:47,421 --> 01:44:50,150
that is a lush tropical rain forest up
there.

2287
01:44:50,151 --> 01:44:51,960
It's so wild.
It's,

2288
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:53,690
it's so,
it's so interesting too.

2289
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:54,620
When you,
when you're up there,

2290
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:57,170
you,
you realize like how diverse it is with

2291
01:44:57,171 --> 01:44:59,510
life.
When you're walking around in it and you

2292
01:44:59,511 --> 01:45:03,160
see just elk shit everywhere you go
walking through the woods there,

2293
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:03,860
it's just,
yeah,

2294
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:06,650
there's with them piles.
All these pellets.

2295
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:08,010
Marvel's,
yeah.

2296
01:45:08,450 --> 01:45:09,283
Yeah.
It's like,

2297
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:13,310
nope.
Don't want it so much life up there.

2298
01:45:13,311 --> 01:45:15,280
He's salmon.
There's so much salmon.

2299
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:16,730
There's eagles up there.
I mean,

2300
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:18,350
it's gorgeous,
man.

2301
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:22,460
Here you aren't fucking Connecticut
mushroom hunting.

2302
01:45:22,461 --> 01:45:24,950
There's all kinds of stuff really live
off the land.

2303
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:28,050
There's some great spots to go.
Shannon trailing and Olympia area sure.

2304
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:30,140
Of getting out in the woods and just
walking around.

2305
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:32,310
It's,
it's actually been really cool to take

2306
01:45:32,311 --> 01:45:33,740
it,
especially when you go back in the

2307
01:45:33,741 --> 01:45:36,830
summertime and especially in the
summertime to go visit family,

2308
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:39,110
uh,
to take my little dude.

2309
01:45:39,570 --> 01:45:40,760
Um,
my son's two years old,

2310
01:45:40,761 --> 01:45:42,770
he just turned two.
And so walking with him,

2311
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:45,350
he's just fucking loves it walking
through the,

2312
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:47,410
and you don't have to worry about the
fucking ticks,

2313
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:50,030
right?
You can get lame shit like that and go

2314
01:45:50,031 --> 01:45:51,560
out there and roll around and all you
want,

2315
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:54,170
but going up,
they have a nice little,

2316
01:45:54,171 --> 01:45:57,470
like a quarter mile trail goes up
through the woods.

2317
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:00,470
Let me just walk through that thing.
He just marches along the whole fucking

2318
01:46:00,471 --> 01:46:04,400
way.
And just that experience of stopping and

2319
01:46:04,401 --> 01:46:05,320
listening,
you can hear them,

2320
01:46:05,321 --> 01:46:08,540
red tail Hawk crying over the top of
everything else.

2321
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:10,700
And then you,
they have great horn owls from time to

2322
01:46:10,701 --> 01:46:12,320
time that could cruise through was
there,

2323
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:17,120
you can hear the little chipmunks and
squirrels and you hear the fucking crows

2324
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:21,830
and a stellar jays and yeah,
everything and stopped telling him,

2325
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:27,510
you gotta hear that and he just stops
and he's so intense and it's,

2326
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:31,310
it's wild to see a little kid who's so
fucking rambunctious.

2327
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:34,070
He's in the house,
but you get a mountain in the woods

2328
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:37,720
overlapping with census,
just listening.

2329
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:39,650
There's sort sorbet everything.
Right.

2330
01:46:39,651 --> 01:46:41,190
So cool.
Yeah.

2331
01:46:41,330 --> 01:46:44,240
Isn't it amazing to looking at it
through the eyes of your child,

2332
01:46:44,510 --> 01:46:47,240
just watching them experiencing all
these things.

2333
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:52,470
It's like you can almost see the little
cogs turning in their head.

2334
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:54,570
Oh Shit.
No,

2335
01:46:54,571 --> 01:46:56,820
it's amazing.
That's one thing that I didn't

2336
01:46:56,821 --> 01:47:01,740
anticipate before you had children.
It's like watching them learn like,

2337
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:02,370
oh wow.

2338
01:47:02,370 --> 01:47:05,670
Like there's a crazy trip you get out of
watching kids learn.

2339
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:06,910
You know,
there's,

2340
01:47:06,910 --> 01:47:11,910
there's something about like you learn
watching them learn and it really sort

2341
01:47:12,661 --> 01:47:16,380
of reinforces this idea that every human
being is essentially,

2342
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,800
I mean they're not a blank slate,
but they are most certainly subject to

2343
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:25,310
the influences of their environment.
What they experience.

2344
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,740
They take that data in.
Yeah.

2345
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:30,750
It's crazy.
Like we ha he loves maps.

2346
01:47:30,751 --> 01:47:32,820
So we got maps.
Maps.

2347
01:47:32,910 --> 01:47:33,743
Yeah,
we got,

2348
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:36,300
you know how like a lot of kids get
those like bedroom,

2349
01:47:36,590 --> 01:47:38,550
uh,
math that have like the roads and stuff.

2350
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:42,900
We got one of the war like the globe and
none of the countries are marked down on

2351
01:47:42,901 --> 01:47:46,710
it or anything.
But we knew some of the spots and so we

2352
01:47:46,711 --> 01:47:49,530
started teaching him,
he knows where like over a hundred

2353
01:47:49,531 --> 01:47:53,670
different countries are.
Like he knows that he knows where

2354
01:47:53,671 --> 01:47:54,120
they're at.

2355
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:57,180
He can point out the difference between
Cambodia,

2356
01:47:57,450 --> 01:47:59,430
Guam,
Vietnam,

2357
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:01,850
Nepal,
rush it and they're like Russia and

2358
01:48:01,851 --> 01:48:04,080
China pretty easy.
But then you go over to Europe,

2359
01:48:04,081 --> 01:48:05,700
he's like hungry Turkey,
Greece,

2360
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,270
he like,
he,

2361
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:09,110
he knows that he knows what Portugal is.
He knows we're speaking.

2362
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:11,940
Show you.
I tell you what Africa is,

2363
01:48:11,941 --> 01:48:13,660
I'm pretty sure I know the difference in
Australia,

2364
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:16,470
New Zealand.
The only reason I know them it's cause

2365
01:48:16,471 --> 01:48:20,400
I'm playing the game with him.
So we got more maps that have like the

2366
01:48:20,401 --> 01:48:23,250
world again,
but everything's marked out and he's

2367
01:48:23,251 --> 01:48:24,780
starting to learn all the different
flags.

2368
01:48:24,781 --> 01:48:26,980
He knows,
he knows at least it doesn't in a

2369
01:48:26,981 --> 01:48:28,980
different flags.
They're so open,

2370
01:48:28,981 --> 01:48:30,580
you know,
children there.

2371
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:34,200
I mean they learn language so quick.
They're so open.

2372
01:48:34,430 --> 01:48:36,960
Let me think about kids learn language.
By the time they go to school,

2373
01:48:36,961 --> 01:48:37,920
they already know how to talk.

2374
01:48:39,130 --> 01:48:41,340
They don't learn in school.
Learn how to talk.

2375
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:45,510
When my wife has her master's degree at
the university level for teaching

2376
01:48:45,511 --> 01:48:48,660
English as a second language.
So she's with him all day long.

2377
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:51,270
Oh Wow.
And so she and she hurt.

2378
01:48:51,271 --> 01:48:53,520
She comes from a family of teachers,
her parents,

2379
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:55,920
both of her parents,
her sister,

2380
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:58,920
her great grandmother,
her grandmother,

2381
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:02,040
all educators.
And I'm supposed to be amazing for her

2382
01:49:02,041 --> 01:49:04,270
to be a mom then.
And so she like,

2383
01:49:04,910 --> 01:49:06,240
she's with the dude all day long.
Like,

2384
01:49:06,241 --> 01:49:08,040
she fucking loves the shit out of him.
But you know,

2385
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:11,670
like you try to spend in fucking day in
and day out with the little dude,

2386
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:15,000
like the little,
the little fucking numbskulls running

2387
01:49:15,001 --> 01:49:18,690
around and trying to learn how to
interact with the world is fucking

2388
01:49:18,691 --> 01:49:20,310
crazy.
But it's so cool.

2389
01:49:20,610 --> 01:49:25,530
And with that background,
understanding how to interpret what's

2390
01:49:25,531 --> 01:49:30,531
going on in his brain a little bit.
So to help nourish it essentially to

2391
01:49:30,811 --> 01:49:31,950
help like,
you know,

2392
01:49:31,951 --> 01:49:34,860
just make things that much more solid.
Like it's fucking crazy.

2393
01:49:34,861 --> 01:49:37,620
And he speaks so clearly.
That's awesome.

2394
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:38,910
Yeah.
I got to get out of here,

2395
01:49:38,911 --> 01:49:41,040
but I,
they have a blind auction.

2396
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:45,570
Yeah.
Why don't you go grab those dives so we

2397
01:49:45,571 --> 01:49:47,680
can show up.
Go grab those real quick him real quick

2398
01:49:47,681 --> 01:49:48,130
and we'll,
we'll

2399
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:50,590
tell people about the auction.
But he's uh,

2400
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:54,720
he's got these fucking killer knives
that a,

2401
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:57,370
he's made these a chef's knives.
The one that's going up.

2402
01:49:57,490 --> 01:49:58,480
I think so.
God,

2403
01:49:58,590 --> 01:50:01,420
look how beautiful that is.
We're looking at his,

2404
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:06,430
a mousy fire arts instagram page and the
design the pattern on this chef's knife.

2405
01:50:09,190 --> 01:50:11,620
It doesn't even look real folks.
I mean,

2406
01:50:11,621 --> 01:50:15,760
it looks like someone's,
it looks like someone put like one of

2407
01:50:15,761 --> 01:50:19,450
those crazy cartoon filters,
doesn't it?

2408
01:50:19,690 --> 01:50:21,730
Is that it?
That's the knife right there.

2409
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,810
There's that one so people could see it.
Yeah.

2410
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:26,470
Here it is right here.
I'm holding it up.

2411
01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:28,660
So this knife is a for auction.

2412
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:30,130
No,
actually is not the,

2413
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:32,550
that one is not this one here in the
cases.

2414
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:35,550
You can pull that out.
And how can people auction,

2415
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:39,980
how can people bid on?
So this is for a benefit for Alex's,

2416
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:41,570
uh,
the Alex or sorry,

2417
01:50:41,690 --> 01:50:46,690
La Loves Alex's lemonade stand,
which is for childhood cancer research.

2418
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:50,180
And so online smells,
again,

2419
01:50:50,930 --> 01:50:53,120
if you go to a,
my instagram profile,

2420
01:50:53,470 --> 01:50:56,060
um,
my laci fire arts on Instagram,

2421
01:50:56,650 --> 01:51:01,040
I have a link actually in my bio that
goes straight to the auction page for

2422
01:51:01,041 --> 01:51:02,500
this knife.
Now these knives are,

2423
01:51:03,050 --> 01:51:04,490
uh,
right now my current prices,

2424
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:09,470
this one knife is a $4,200,
but right now I think the bidding's at

2425
01:51:09,471 --> 01:51:10,370
like,
Oh,

2426
01:51:10,371 --> 01:51:14,690
there it is 2100.
So there's a chance that somebody could

2427
01:51:14,691 --> 01:51:16,460
get it for less than what I would
normally,

2428
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:21,770
when does it end?
The auction ends on Saturday the eighth.

2429
01:51:21,771 --> 01:51:25,430
So that's when the actual event is and
I'm actually going to be there at the

2430
01:51:25,431 --> 01:51:26,450
event hanging out.

2431
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:28,640
Um,
if anybody's got any questions about it,

2432
01:51:28,641 --> 01:51:32,140
talk about it or you know,
just kinda hang out and that's don't

2433
01:51:32,150 --> 01:51:33,680
folks,
but you know,

2434
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:37,520
it's interesting like doing this kind of
work is the first time I've ever had

2435
01:51:37,521 --> 01:51:41,390
anything that I felt like I could give
back with cause otherwise,

2436
01:51:41,391 --> 01:51:45,380
like I was just did shitty little jobs.
But this is the first time I feel like I

2437
01:51:45,381 --> 01:51:50,030
have something like an offer.
So in coming up from very little,

2438
01:51:50,031 --> 01:51:53,750
very humble beginnings,
this was an opportunity now to feel like

2439
01:51:53,751 --> 01:51:56,760
I can give back.
And so I tried to do this from tons of

2440
01:51:56,761 --> 01:51:58,520
very cool for sure.
Well listen man,

2441
01:51:58,550 --> 01:52:00,020
I'm glad we finally got together.

2442
01:52:01,070 --> 01:52:04,130
You mean these awesome knives?
I will cherish them forever and it's my

2443
01:52:04,131 --> 01:52:04,850
pleasure,
my man,

2444
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:07,130
amazing craftsmen.
And it was cool to do this.

2445
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:08,360
Thanks.
Thanks for being here.

2446
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,310
All right folks.
We'll be back

2447
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:12,310
soon.
You fucks.

2448
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:13,630
Bye.
Bye.

2449
01:52:13,631 --> 01:52:14,464
Bye.

2450
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:23,070
Okay.
