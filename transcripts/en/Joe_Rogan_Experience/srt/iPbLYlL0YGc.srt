00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,190
and and the thing is there's this
illusion of stability.

3
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:09,860
There's the solution that because the
system is so big,

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,760
it can't possibly be for your child,
but the truth is exactly the opposite.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,650
It has become incredibly fragile.
It is extremely overextended and

6
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,150
extremely fragile,
and you see the,

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,750
the Federal Reserve at the moment has
been pumping money into the economy like

8
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:26,720
crazy for five years and as they do
that,

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,080
you get diminishing returns,
so every here they put the same amount

10
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:32,510
of money in and they,
they move the economy,

11
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:36,230
they moved the stock market a bit less
and then they put more money in and it

12
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:40,460
moves a bit lesson until they're putting
money in just to keep it stable.

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,530
Now I've seen that pattern before.
I mean that looks like a cocaine habit

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,740
right
in the first year,

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,130
right?
The coke addict is snorting a lot of

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,180
free Federal Reserve money and the stock
market's getting really high.

17
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:00,800
Indeed's bye bye.
Here.

18
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:04,520
Five it takes.
It takes a big fat line of Federal

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,370
Reserve money just just to keep the
stock market from crashing in the

20
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:12,290
morning.
And then one day which happened in mid

21
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,290
October,
the Federal Reserve turned off the tap a

22
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,720
month ago.
Federal Reserve stopped giving out free

23
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:23,390
money to the banks.
We haven't seen the effect that will

24
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:26,690
have in the stock market,
but if you follow your cocaine addict

25
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:29,570
analysis
right now,

26
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:32,630
that addict is Jonesing for a hit and is
really,

27
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:35,780
really cranky.
Some bad things could happen.

28
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,720
But yeah,
there are about seven to eight months

29
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:42,680
away from sucking trucker dicks.
And that's really what's going on.

30
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,580
I mean,
there are about.

31
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,630
They're about that far away.
There's a lot of people like super

32
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,710
pumped up to start a revolution.
They're walking into trader Joe's,

33
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:55,040
clapping their hands saying,
you can't stop the revolution.

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,980
Have you seen this?
It's fucking videos of these morons.

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,160
And it's usually like menopausal women
dudes with aimless shiftless minds.

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,490
You know,
people that there's something wrong with

37
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:08,840
them.
They're out there walking through

38
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:11,370
supermarkets yelling at people,
people just trying.

39
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:13,710
And you can't stop the revolution.
It's like,

40
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,150
what revolution is this?
The revolution that interrupts shopping

41
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:18,680
with shitty singing revolution

42
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,680
can have affordable yogurt and fresh
fruits,

43
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,490
privileges.
It's this thing of doing nothing but

44
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,130
making a lot of energy and sound by
doing it.

45
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,490
Like I get that you're upset about
police brutality.

46
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:32,680
I get that you're upset about the way
this country's going.

47
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,290
I get the.
But going through trader Joe's,

48
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,770
clapping your hands is in fixing a
fucking thing because just going to

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,500
alienate people to whatever dumb idea
you have.

50
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,690
Yeah.
Uh,

51
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,080
there was a woman in Venice beach who
came up to me recently and asked me to

52
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,540
sign our petition to run for president.
She's gonna run.

53
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,010
Yeah.
I was Kinda like,

54
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:52,420
well,
don't you maybe you want to start with

55
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:54,250
like a youtube channel or something
like,

56
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,270
who the fuck are you,
you know,

57
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:59,410
you can't just leap right to president.
And she had a few signatures and was so

58
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:00,460
serious about it.
And I was like,

59
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,450
well,
what's the platform?

60
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,490
And she's like,
we're going to eliminate homelessness in

61
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:05,320
Venice beach.
And I was thinking like,

62
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:07,120
that's not really a national platform,
you know,

63
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,230
you're gonna become president and be
like,

64
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,960
we have to address the five homeless
people right here.

65
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,003
So,
um,

66
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,990
my point though is I think that people
think that they have to change something

67
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:20,440
and they have to do something because
they can see all the problems around

68
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:22,630
them.
And for some people that's let's go to a

69
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:25,480
protest or let's,
let's run for office or let's,

70
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,280
you know,
let's just start a petition no matter

71
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:32,230
how ridiculous it sounds.
And the sad reality is revolution is

72
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:35,650
silent nowadays.
Like the people who are online buying

73
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:40,651
bitcoin and developing these other coins
are creating more of a revolution than

74
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,000
anybody in the trader Joe's on a
Tuesday.

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,460
But I feel like that's the type of shit
that like when you almost start dressing

76
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:49,160
like a chick,
like you actually get more pussy,

77
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,250
like more women coming in.
Like that rock star thing that in,

78
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,010
in this fucking lucky you start
borrowing their clothes and next ain't

79
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,844
no,
they're blowing you.

80
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,480
Once I heard it went well.
What's really funny is that an hit

81
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,330
parade is pretty.
Like Judas priest started a lot of the

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,100
metal stuff.
Rob Halford,

83
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,790
snm dressing,
snam dressing and people didn't realize

84
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,260
he was gay as fuck right here.
I had no idea rob hoffer was gay as

85
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,220
fuck,
and he got all these guys to essentially

86
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:16,150
dress like gay s and m guys.
Yeah.

87
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,710
That was what became the look is
brilliant,

88
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,020
but that's so much of a bad
motherfucker.

89
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:22,400
He is.
He made

90
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,770
one of the great front man and then
nothing too he.

91
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,800
He basically was completely 100 percent
other than Freddie mercury who was

92
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:37,060
literally in a band called Queen
at.

93
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,390
We're just so dumb,
like,

94
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:39,800
no,
he's fine.

95
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,590
He's straight.
He seems good.

96
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,100
That's all.
Don't be homophobic

97
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,190
like it matters.
Yeah.

98
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,680
To tie to mercury.
I made that fucking guy that,

99
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:54,260
that live aid set is one of the.
I would put that up against anybody's

100
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,140
performance ever.
Well,

101
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,780
who's a bad motherfucker?
He turned Wembley Stadium into a fucking

102
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,770
coffee house.
He had them.

103
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,110
Everybody like the fucking back row
[inaudible].

104
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,990
That guy was unbelievable.
Yeah,

105
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,900
he was sensational.
He was a really unique talent.

106
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,010
Like there was no one like him before
because he was such a combination of

107
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:20,810
like masculinity and femininity and I
never noticed any of that.

108
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:22,520
I was just like,
this fucking guy.

109
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:23,950
He can't stop watching them,
but his,

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,680
his,
his,

111
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,513
his,
uh,

112
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,640
his singing was credible and he was a
better,

113
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:31,820
live as good as the albums where he's
one of the few guys that was actually

114
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,260
fucking better live.

115
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,930
Wow.
I haven't seen anybody come close to

116
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:37,130
that guy.
Wow.

117
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,510
Since,
wow.

118
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,860
That's a strong bill.
Burr.

119
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,500
Anybody.
You got anybody that could fuck fucking

120
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:46,250
hold 100,000 people in the palm of his
hand after he had to follow all those

121
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:47,810
other base.
You know,

122
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,480
it's true.
You have to go on after Robert Plant

123
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,500
Jimmy page.
That one didn't go well.

124
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,330
That was what.
That was one of the ones that didn't go

125
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:55,340
out,
which is why 2007 went so well because

126
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:56,480
they were like,
we can't do that again.

127
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,820
They put it together the last fucking
second.

128
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:02,950
And then he had bad.
They had to dramas at the saint.

129
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,230
Can you please whisper in my ear during
my accident?
