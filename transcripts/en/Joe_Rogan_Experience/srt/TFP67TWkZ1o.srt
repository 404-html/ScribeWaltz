1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,270
Rogan experience,
that's where that comes from.

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:06,370
I mean that was just fucking tense.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,091
Oh,
it's the,

4
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:09,250
it's the practicality to me,
right?

5
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:09,701
Like,
yes,

6
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:11,020
exactly.
We have a referee,

7
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:12,820
we have walls,
we have whatever,

8
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:13,900
you know,
fans.

9
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:16,570
It's entertaining people.
But like I need to know,

10
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,890
I need to know that.
Like would that be in nature,

11
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,720
you know,
that'd be doing whatever that be

12
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:27,400
selfdefence that'd be fucked.
US fighting over a territory or food or

13
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:29,650
whatever.
Like I need to know what would happen.

14
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,140
Like if we had like that's why I want
these finishes.

15
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:36,160
We only get 15 minutes to be able to
tell ourselves what would have happened

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,170
in that situation.
You know?

17
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,870
And when it goes to a decision,
I'm pissed because I don't know,

18
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,550
you know,
like you don't know,

19
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:46,390
especially these three round fights
where I'm waking up like these last

20
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,770
couple fights,
like late in the fight,

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,040
I'm pissed because I'm like,
I don't know if that would have been

22
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:54,730
another 30 minutes or another two hours
that we're scrapping in the woods.

23
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:56,500
Like who gets the bone?
You know?

24
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:58,640
I want to know.
And so that's,

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,760
that's crazy.
And of practicality,

26
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,760
and it's your survival and this is the
way I get to know myself.

27
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,860
That's deep.
Who gets the EU

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,200
the way you just put it.
Not only you've ever heard anybody put

29
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:17,010
it that way.
You need to know that the problem with

30
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:20,640
vegans is the problem with people.
It's not veganism,

31
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:23,970
it's people.
If you get a room that has 100 people in

32
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:26,490
it,
the odds of one of those people being a

33
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:30,900
fucking idiot is a hundred percent.
It's almost 100 percent that one of them

34
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:31,980
is a fucking idiot.
Yeah.

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,470
So if you get $300,
million people,

36
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:38,430
you have 3 million fucking idiots and
some of those folks are vegans.

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,980
And that's the problem with veganism.
It's not,

38
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,210
it's not veganism itself.
It's there's a certain percentage of

39
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:49,710
human beings that they don't have to do
anything to become vegans,

40
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,450
right?
They just joined this group.

41
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:52,740
It's not like you have it.
Well,

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,290
we're,
we're thinking about allowing you in to

43
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,420
the Vegan culture,
but we want to know what your philosophy

44
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:57,780
is.

45
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,570
Are you a hateful person?
Are you a person that's looking to be a

46
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,100
Vegan?
So you can just talk shit about other

47
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:04,000
people,
are you looking to be and are you

48
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:08,520
looking to be in a group or a gang of
plant based Gad and put the word Vegan

49
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:11,910
in front of your name and just start
talking shit because that's a lot of the

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,000
people.
And so people read all these angry,

51
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,160
hateful things that these people,
right?

52
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,611
And they go,
oh,

53
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:19,410
well this is vegans,
but it's not.

54
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,810
It's not.
Most vegans are not like that at all

55
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,390
people.
Most people are not like that at all,

56
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,960
but there's a certain percentage of them
and they claimed veganism and they

57
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:31,140
usually put that name,
the word Vegan in their fucking screen

58
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:33,150
name.
That's how you can spot those assholes.

59
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:34,530
Yeah,
they're proud.

60
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,700
Yeah,
they're into it.

61
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,930
They're in a plant based gang.

62
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,280
That's really what happens.
Yeah.

63
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,290
And so what it is is not necessarily
even a problem of diet.

64
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,150
It's a problem of human nature,
is that people love to stand on the

65
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:51,270
moral high ground that will love to
point down at all the other people.

66
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,840
Whether it's a religious issue,
like you're not eating Halau or you're

67
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,080
not eating kosher or you,
you're eating meat on Good Friday,

68
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,420
whatever the fuck it is,
they just decide that they have this

69
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,720
moral high ground that you don't have,
so fuck you.

70
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,030
I'm doing it right.
And it really comes from our own

71
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:11,920
questions of our own existence and this
messiness that we're all inherently

72
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:14,740
aware of that life eats life.

73
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,280
So it's weird.
But whole life I thought I'd be scared

74
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,130
to death and most people we all are.
We're all terrified of fucking dying

75
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,650
because we don't know.
But that was the closest I ever came and

76
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,590
I wasn't scared.
Like suddenly the fear just went away

77
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:28,810
and it seemed logical.
Like of course it's over,

78
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,750
like things end and I didn't want to
die.

79
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:33,070
I wasn't,
didn't have a death wish,

80
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,050
but I was like,
if it's done,

81
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:36,220
it's,
it's kind of,

82
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,550
it's done.
And count your blessings and be happy

83
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:40,990
and don't be a bitch.
Like don't.

84
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,690
If,
if the fucking fairy man shows up

85
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,850
tonight,
don't fucking hold out.

86
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,340
Don't be the last asshole at the party.
Go No,

87
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,310
like just fucking pay the ferryman get
on a boat and go,

88
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,060
we'll see what's next and stuff and then
ultimately late in time did a good job

89
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:56,770
and I fucking wound up living and stuff.

90
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,190
So I know this much.
I got to read a bunch of shit like after

91
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,050
I nearly died and it was all nice.
People wrote very nice things about me

92
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:06,740
and shit and I expected,
you know,

93
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,910
creature of the Internet that some
people be like I wish he had fucking

94
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,410
died.
Fuck them to death and shit.

95
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,130
I wish he'd stay silent.
But generally it was like very nice

96
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:17,110
things.
People were kind of positive and stuff.

97
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,660
So I was like fuck man.
Like

98
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,140
you know,
again,

99
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:28,141
I didn't want to die but like if I had
like that would've been okay.

100
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:30,160
Now I'm back at it.
You know what I'm saying?

101
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:35,161
Like now until it ends like I've got a,
you know,

102
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:39,550
and it's Kinda easy as long as they
don't wake up with a fucking dead girl

103
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,540
are alive.
Boy,

104
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:44,320
I don't think like they'll fucking broke
me over the coals when I die in the

105
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,400
future and shit like that.

106
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,030
But it felt weird to be so close to the
completion.

107
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:53,110
And so having something that normally
terrifies you suddenly be like,

108
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,130
oh,
it's okay.

109
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,330
Like I don't know if you walked up and
put a gun in my face,

110
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,650
I'm sure I'd feel threatened,
but like I kind of lost my fear of

111
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,450
death.
I'm not like death defying.

112
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:06,310
I won't go out and do anything
differently,

113
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,080
but that,
that dark cloud that kind of kills any

114
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:13,240
good time.
The moment you start thinking about like

115
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,100
the fear and anxiety you're going to die
one day,

116
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,590
like you know it's gone and now all of a
sudden I'm like,

117
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:19,290
yeah,
I'm going to die one day and it's going

118
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,670
to be awesome,
but not for the reasons that you think.

119
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,260
I'm saying it's going to be awesome.
Just be awesome.

120
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,080
Because a finish like it's nice to
finish things.

121
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,140
We know how good it feels in life to
complete something and that's the

122
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:32,230
biggest fucking thing in life you'll
ever complete is your journey.

123
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,850
So I didn't walk away going like I got
to do more.

124
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,280
Like I got to fucking live life to the
fullest.

125
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,740
I just got to keep doing what I've been
doing.

126
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,700
Like living life the way I enjoy it,
trying to do things.

127
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:47,770
Sometimes they work,
sometimes I fail and Shit.

128
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,160
Sometimes people are on your side.
Sometimes people like you fucking blow

129
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,110
and just do that fucking time.
Have good conversations in the process.

130
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:57,980
Meet interesting people here,
new points

131
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,130
of view and shit like that and keep at
it.

132
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,350
But it's nothing to be afraid of.
From my perspective.

133
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,880
They were just calling me more name said
trying to set up straw men.

134
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:14,340
And is this egyptologist who is in that
documentary who dismissed everything was

135
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,220
still around.
Oh yeah.

136
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,240
And has he amended his position at all?
Not to my knowledge.

137
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,930
I haven't spoken with him for years and
years and years.

138
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,590
Did you ever speak with them off the
record or personally alone?

139
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,420
What is this?
Oh,

140
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,690
I'll tell you this,
but he didn't say this off the record

141
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,250
house.
I guess it was off the record.

142
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:35,840
I don't think I will shut this years
ago,

143
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:39,650
but I'll say it now at that debate,
at that debate,

144
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,140
AAA's debate.
He,

145
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,310
I just suddenly found myself in the hall
with him and there was no one else

146
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:49,790
around so he could totally deny this.

147
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,850
But it's true.
My perspective,

148
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:55,450
at least he,
um,

149
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,620
said something to me like,
you know,

150
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,560
you don't really believe this.
I know you don't really believe this.

151
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:04,010
You just won't be on television and,
you know,

152
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,070
be famous or something like that.
He said,

153
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:07,611
I said,
no,

154
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:11,420
I really do believe it.
Or you know,

155
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:14,600
I really go by the evidence and I do
think the evidence says this.

156
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,790
And he served was telling me that,
no,

157
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,601
you don't,
you know,

158
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,540
he was like,
I dunno.

159
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,760
I analyze what the sizing you.
Yeah,

160
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:23,594
yeah,
yeah.

161
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,960
And then he slept in and then,
and then what he does is he starts

162
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:31,520
asking me a question of some detailed
question about the geology and well,

163
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:35,270
if that's the case,
how can such and such and I think in

164
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:40,220
hindsight might have been fed to them by
some geo archeologists just say call

165
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,950
someone who does archeology but knows a
little geology.

166
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,750
Uh,
and I,

167
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,120
I realize in hindsight it was meant to
be one of those Gotcha questions.

168
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,940
I guess they say nowadays where I
wouldn't be able to answer it,

169
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:53,891
but no,
I had,

170
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,960
of course I'd thought about it.
It was to me as a geologist,

171
00:07:56,961 --> 00:07:59,330
very obvious.
So I start giving him this detailed

172
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:02,180
explanation as to why that's not the
case and why,

173
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,100
you know,
my evidence stands up,

174
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,030
blah,
blah blah.

175
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,490
And we're standing there face to face.
I'm explained this to her and I see his

176
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:14,550
face turn and it goes blank and I'm in
midsentence.

177
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,860
He just turns around and walks away.
He's the one who realized he couldn't,

178
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,580
he couldn't refute what you were saying.
Refute what I was saying.

179
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:27,320
And he wasn't really answered.
My takeaway is that he wasn't interested

180
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:30,630
in discussing it rationally or aunts,
you know,

181
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,970
he just went to win the debate or
whatever.

182
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:35,710
He

183
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,461
but,
so,

184
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:37,294
um,
when,

185
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,570
when Charlie and I met and I,
like I told him what my plan to sort of

186
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:43,210
help black America and wake them up
because they understood how we had

187
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,160
fallen victim to this brainwash,
brainwash,

188
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,690
the leftist dogma.
There's this idea that because we're

189
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:51,280
black,
we have to vote Democrat and anybody

190
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,740
that is not a Democrat is racist and
against helping us.

191
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,730
That is what so black Americans believe.
I believed it.

192
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,350
I believed it.
You know what I mean?

193
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:58,900
So,
and I'm a,

194
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm a pretty smart girl,
you know,

195
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,610
I've always been a very smart girl.
I've always,

196
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,530
I've always been,
you know,

197
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,550
I've excelled in,
in academics,

198
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,810
right?
So how did I fall victim to it?

199
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,120
The exact same system,
right?

200
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,890
These three verticals,
the first being the family,

201
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:13,890
that breakdown of the family.
The second one I'm being culture,

202
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,230
which then to me like growing up it was
like Jay z,

203
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,670
Jay z was God to me.

204
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,080
Like I would throw on,
like I was,

205
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,310
you know,
I went through a lot of stuff when I was

206
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:21,600
a kid.
I didn't have a great family,

207
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,770
um,
you know,

208
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,960
um,
but I would throw on a Jay z album and

209
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:26,310
like whatever he said,
it was like,

210
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:27,720
it was like going to church,
you know,

211
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,090
and then,
and I can't stand them now,

212
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,190
but the third vertical,
no,

213
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,170
no,
because he knows exactly what he's doing

214
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:36,870
and he's a trader,
but third vertical being education,

215
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,540
which was casual side trader.
Yeah.

216
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,400
It's like,
like beyonce because he knows what's

217
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:47,520
happening to black America and he's
somebody that built his entire career

218
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,920
off the backs of black America,
you know,

219
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,050
of being.
The guy who started in the honing in,

220
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,590
in,
you know,

221
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,550
queens and worked at it was a drug
dealer and worked his way up and it

222
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:58,380
became the io for so many people in
Black America.

223
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,840
And then he stands on stage and endorses
Hillary Clinton.

224
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,140
He stands on stage and tell us black
America to put the same people in the

225
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,650
White House that locked up more black
men than any present history of United

226
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,440
States.
Bill Clinton,

227
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,230
right.
The person that stands on the crime bill

228
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:13,170
of 94 is Bill Clinton.
But because Jay Z is now focused on

229
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:15,210
getting a piece of the pie,
the globalist piece of the Pie,

230
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:16,950
he doesn't care about black America.
Um,

231
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,210
that's,
that's my opinion.

232
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,840
Um,
so what do you think that maybe he

233
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:24,690
thought the Donald Trump represented a
lot of racist white people?

234
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,760
No.
Oh God,

235
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:27,990
no.
Not even.

236
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:28,830
Kind of.
Not,

237
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,550
not for a single second,
Jason,

238
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,640
because Jason is very smart.
Just speak to him.

239
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,500
No,
I didn't speak to him.

240
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,170
I just,
I know there's a certain thing where

241
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:37,860
like,
I just,

242
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,020
I know that Jay z and beyonce betrayed
the black community.

243
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,660
Like there they are.
I think they did it purposely for

244
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:43,680
financial gain.
Yeah.

245
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:44,401
I think,
yeah,

246
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:45,190
I think that they,
they,

247
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,510
they were interested in having,
they want to be the people that control

248
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:50,220
the world and they felt that Hillary
Clinton,

249
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,780
you know,
they were working with Obama very

250
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:55,260
closely and very clearly.
Now we know that the Obama

251
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:58,140
administration worked very hard to get
Hillary Clinton to office and they

252
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:02,550
wanted to stay in that group,
and so they supported Hillary Clinton

253
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:06,120
who was selected behind closed doors.
Forget the American people to be the

254
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:07,320
next president.
United States.

255
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:07,990
Yeah.
