1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,860
Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,010
North Korea has a constitution
which is for display purposes only,

3
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:10,850
but what really governs the country
is the 10 commandments of Kim Il Sung,

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,740
and the 10th commandment is,

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:13,731
I forgot what it is,

6
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:14,061
something there.

7
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:16,940
It's the revolution shall be continued
through the generations until it's

8
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:17,421
completed.

9
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:21,110
Which means only a descendant of
Kim Il Sung can be the leader.

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,340
So Kim Jong,

11
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:23,630
Il had three sons.

12
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,430
The middle one is a sissy,

13
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,360
so he doesn't count.

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,180
He's a sissy.

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,013
Yeah,

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,840
they said he's too much like a girl,

17
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,980
like that's all we know about him.

18
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:33,590
And he's a big Eric
Clapton for certain all.

19
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,390
Like this guy,

20
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,223
pictures of this guy.

21
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,021
There's some online.

22
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:37,460
You sitting there with his shoes off.

23
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,820
So the eldest son was Kim Jong
Nam and the youngest was Kim Jong,

24
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:47,600
Il and Kim Jong Nam wanted
to liberalize Kim Jong.

25
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:48,201
Il Said No.

26
00:00:48,201 --> 00:00:50,360
So if Kim Jong UN is going to be replaced,

27
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,050
the only one who could have replaced
him was his older brother Kim Jong Nam.

28
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,430
So if he's killed,

29
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:56,720
that's an insurance policy.

30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,040
Oh.

31
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,490
So he killed him just to make
sure that he wasn't overthrown.

32
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,020
And he killed his sons to it.

33
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,270
Right now he killed his.

34
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,020
His,

35
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,520
his aunt's husband.

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,271
Oh,

37
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:09,080
Jesus.

38
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,240
Yeah.

39
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,330
But she drove his,

40
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,660
her daughter to suicide.

41
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,400
So there it's game of thrones,

42
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,530
inhuman six,

43
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:14,871
six,

44
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:15,560
six stuff.

45
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,150
Wow.

46
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,390
And they boast about.

47
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:17,750
I mean,

48
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,490
when I was doing my research for the book,

49
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,330
they don't hide.

50
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,400
They boast about all
the stick shit they do.

51
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,900
Like North Korea was recently criticized
by the UN for having concentration

52
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:28,370
camps and they literally said,

53
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,950
we don't use that term
so we don't have any.

54
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,660
That was their response.

55
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,620
What are you going to do about it?

56
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,520
That's how I described the for the
first and only time I ever smoked gust.

57
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,511
Oh Jesus.

58
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:40,880
You did that while I hung out with,

59
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,210
when I was one of the neighborhoods
I moved into doing this.

60
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,980
Is there a fucking gateway drug to
dust and tell you as it's called Solos?

61
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,450
Did they go right from Diet Pepsi to dust?

62
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:55,284
I don't know.

63
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,130
Here's the.

64
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,450
Here's my story is I moved
onto this street called
independence avenue in in the

65
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:00,901
valley.

66
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:03,960
It's like West valley kind
of Desoto Sherman way.

67
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,740
And it was heavily Latino neighborhood
and like we moved in and it was cool.

68
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:09,931
I mean,

69
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:10,470
like I lived at,

70
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,790
I came friends with a lot of people,

71
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:12,624
but like,

72
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,543
um,

73
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,220
I went from like the end of
elementary school into junior high,

74
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,450
right in that era.

75
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:19,830
So like once we hit the junior high,

76
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:22,290
it's like a lot of the Mexican
kids I was hanging out with,

77
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,080
started hanging out with you a little
bit older Mexican kids and a lot of them

78
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:27,450
were dealing in like kind
of gang life over there.

79
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,440
Um,

80
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,170
uh,

81
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,070
it's just part of the way they get done.

82
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,950
And so.

83
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,990
And a lot of them like to fucking do dips,

84
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:38,910
which is like a fucking sherm cigarette
dipped into my fucking angel angel dust

85
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:39,690
sounds.

86
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,700
So healthy choice dudes out.

87
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,840
It's how I wound up with this,

88
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:43,950
this little tattoo right here.

89
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,480
First Tattoo I ever had in my life.

90
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,590
This little three dots.

91
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,940
Normally it's supposed to be up here,

92
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:49,200
but I wasn't in a gang.

93
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,860
Oh.

94
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,461
So it's like,

95
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,440
for some reason I was so fucked up.

96
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,251
This is what wound up.

97
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:53,501
I mean this,

98
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:54,950
this represents what they called me,

99
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,700
veto loca.

100
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,910
It's like little three dots here,

101
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,270
but it's like that happened because I
smoke because these dudes pass me the

102
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,870
sherm.

103
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,170
I didn't really know what I was when I
was like this bang and the literally the

104
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:06,820
way you just described
that time traveling,

105
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:11,080
it was like I felt like if I thought
of something to do by the time I was

106
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:13,330
finished with the thought
of thinking to do it,

107
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,350
I had already done it.

108
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,340
I'm going to call my mom goodbye mom.

109
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,053
That kind of thing.

110
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,110
It was like fucking nuts.

111
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:24,850
I fucking never experienced
anything like that.

112
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:25,990
I was terrified.

113
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:26,824
I was terrified.

114
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,941
Terrified.

115
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,500
I didn't know what the fuck's going on.

116
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,010
You know?

117
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,843
It was almost like,

118
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,980
you know what I mean?

119
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,980
They gave me a lot of feelings is if
you remember the first Friday movie when

120
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,580
Chris Tucker reflects on like somebody
snuck him a little piece of dust and he

121
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,240
fucking.

122
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,810
It's.

123
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,550
I didn't lose my mind naked all that shit.

124
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:45,220
But I feel like I was the
butt of a joke that night.

125
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,780
Like like somebody gave me some dust,

126
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:47,051
I was like,

127
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:50,110
let's watch fucking the white
boy fucking trip on dust on it,

128
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,450
but it made for a good story on Joe Rogan,

129
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:55,990
so no,

130
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,823
I'm.

131
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,240
You didn't have to sit there and say,

132
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:00,910
well,

133
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,140
a hundred years from now they're going
to lose people looking at our level of

134
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,080
knowledge and they'll be
saying the same exact thing.

135
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,790
What do you think would be the Big One?

136
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,770
Would you think it would
be antidepressants?

137
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:13,140
Do you think it would be painkillers
that they're handing out?

138
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,450
What do you think would be the big one
that people would be freaking out about

139
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:16,284
today?

140
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,560
I think about what we
think what we're doing now.

141
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:20,010
That's.

142
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,010
I think it's overwhelmingly good
to be my God that that quaint,

143
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,090
medieval destructive belief they held
onto them about human agency and freewill.

144
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,240
Whoa.

145
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,240
They punished people who had brains that
couldn't regulate their own behavior.

146
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,990
They punished people who because of toxin
exposure or stress during adolescence,

147
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,170
wound up with brains that couldn't control
this or that a particular junctures

148
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,870
and they used words
like justice back then.

149
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:52,951
Wow.

150
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:55,110
I can't believe the stuff they did,

151
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,590
it was practically like gangs of Gordy
peasants getting burning torches and

152
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:05,340
going and burning down to whatever's
around the medieval castle in terms of

153
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:07,530
senses of the word justice,

154
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:11,160
applying to what biology
has to do with behavior.

155
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,590
There's so few people that share
this idea that you're having,

156
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,140
obviously your sense of it is so much
more educated and the average person and

157
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:23,310
you understand all the mechanisms behind
all of these particular behavioral

158
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,940
problems that people have and all these
different things can affect the way

159
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:28,110
human beings operate,

160
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,810
but most people are not aware of this.

161
00:05:30,811 --> 00:05:33,500
I mean literally most people
like if you had a guest,

162
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,750
if it's.

163
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,100
It might be in the 90 percent of people
haven't really considered all the

164
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:42,540
factors that lead to someone having
a brain that would put them in these

165
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,370
impulsive decision.

166
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,650
Terrible decision making situations.

167
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:47,841
Well,

168
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:52,841
what's what gives me a little bit of
sort of optimism is most people though,

169
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:54,050
at least in the West,

170
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,540
have done that in a couple
of realms like 500 years ago.

171
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,490
If you had an epileptic seizure,

172
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,350
the smartest,

173
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,430
most reflective,

174
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,630
most compassionate,

175
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,810
like middle ages,

176
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,320
bleeding heart liberals even would have
had an explanation for what caused an

177
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:13,190
epileptic seizure,

178
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:16,670
which is you were demonically possessed
and the therapeutic intervention whiston

179
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,020
Bernie with the steak,

180
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,170
and now instead we're are a century or
two into having a mindset where instead

181
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,630
we make a biological statement,

182
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,380
Oh,

183
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,250
it's not him,

184
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,540
it's his disease.

185
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,230
Oh,

186
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,050
he's not demonically possessed these guts.

187
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:34,880
Something screwy with potassium
channels in his brain,

188
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,920
unless he gets synchronized outbursts.

189
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,510
Every now and then he has a
seizure disorder like it's
taken us about 500 years

190
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:43,220
to do that one to go from.

191
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,110
This is a,

192
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,800
a blast from this behavior
where we know the intervention,

193
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:51,170
which is to burn somebody
at the state the same,

194
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:51,890
oh,

195
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,970
it's a biological problem and we
even recognize constraints with it.

196
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:59,150
If somebody has uncontrolled
epilepsy that's treatment resistant,

197
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,260
they may not be able to
get a driver's license,

198
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,030
but you don't sit there and say,

199
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:05,750
yeah,

200
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,020
let's have a burning of the trivers
licenses and the epileptics.

201
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:10,540
It's about damn time they got,

202
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,383
but they were.

203
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,081
No,

204
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:17,081
it's a realm where words like evil
or soul or punishment or justice,

205
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:18,380
it's totally irrelevant.

206
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,890
Oh,

207
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,480
it's a neurological disorder.

208
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,510
So it's only taken us about
500 years to get to that point.

209
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,720
So maybe you know,

210
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,880
we've done that cognitive
leap at least once.

211
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,500
Shit is going through under the city.

212
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,350
Every minute.

213
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,740
Comedy store has a bathroom,

214
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,461
there's a new bathroom.

215
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:36,294
They just put it in.

216
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,460
It backed up last night.

217
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,220
They have old pipes and a new bathroom.

218
00:07:41,221 --> 00:07:43,110
I don't know what they did
if they replace the pipes,

219
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:46,530
but something went wrong and I
walked by the bathroom last night.

220
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:46,891
I was like,

221
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:48,940
what the fuck is that

222
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,030
about the smell of shit
outside of the water.

223
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:55,260
That is just so.

224
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,963
So Chris,

225
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,710
back to the dog thing.

226
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,390
This is my.

227
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,120
We were talking about our dogs
like rolling and shit and stuff.

228
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,490
My cousin doug the other day,

229
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,590
they had people coming to paint the
house and my cousin's wife told them,

230
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,791
hey listen,

231
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,990
you can use our bathroom.

232
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:13,824
Don't worry about go.

233
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,041
You know,

234
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,000
you don't have to go outside.

235
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:15,834
He just,

236
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,520
our bathroom is your bathroom.

237
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,110
But they didn't really speak English,

238
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:23,100
they didn't really listen to her and
some guy took a dump in the bushes.

239
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,900
The dog

240
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,233
rolled around.

241
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,520
He came running inside and she's like,

242
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,773
what is?

243
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,740
Oh my God,

244
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,390
how did you get human shit on your head?

245
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,450
How she knows it smelled different.

246
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,380
And then they went outside
and looked and they're like,

247
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,790
you guys use our bathroom.

248
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,460
Oh,

249
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,930
sorry.

250
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,270
Oh No.

251
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,773
Oh my God.

252
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,700
Look what I found.

253
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,790
These guys are great.

254
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,500
Have you seen these guys that sat there?

255
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:59,334
So great.

256
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,480
Why does a dog water rolling?

257
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,383
Shit?

258
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,360
No.

259
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,070
What is that?

260
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,070
I don't know what
possesses it to think that.

261
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:12,320
That's a good move.

262
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,910
Just so happy.

263
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,411
Oh Man.

264
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:17,221
I guess a role in this.

265
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:18,090
No one's going to throw a ball.

266
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:18,280
Oh,

267
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,113
rolling.

268
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,243
Damn.

269
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,180
Look what I found.

270
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,320
Have you met these guys?

271
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,273
They're awesome.

272
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,081
They're shit.

273
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,370
Smells terrific.
