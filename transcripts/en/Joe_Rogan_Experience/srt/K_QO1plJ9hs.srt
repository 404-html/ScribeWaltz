1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,200
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,450
the next evolution of the podcast is 
complete.

3
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:44,451
Ladies and gentlemen.
It feels like a fucking radio station 

4
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:46,341
now.
We got real chairs instead of those 

5
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:46,341
goofy couches.
We got rid of that shit.

6
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:48,480
One of them's at our house.
The other one's in Brian's place.

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,560
What'd you,
what'd you,

8
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:50,340
by the way?
Uh,

9
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,180
he,
uh,

10
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,820
I think he wants it now.
So now I'm like,

11
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,720
Oh,
I want your chair.

12
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,440
Yeah.
Why?

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,460
Because he has said so.
What'd you do last night?

14
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,090
I went over to Joe's.
Help them hook up the studio and he was.

15
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:03,150
Oh yeah.
Well I think I made to get to that.

16
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:08,151
Sure.
Because you can't even fit that chair 

17
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,391
anywhere in your house.
I was thinking about doing something 

18
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:13,881
like Joe did pretty much taking out my 
whole and my office is just fucking 

19
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:17,691
scary.
I can't even go in my office just too 

20
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:17,691
much shit.

21
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:17,691
So I think I need to empty the whole 
thing out.

22
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:19,650
Redo it and Redo it from scratch.
Yeah.

23
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:21,390
I still need to Redo this area back 
here.

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,850
By the way,
bitches were sponsored by the fleshlight

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,460
holiday boys.
A fleshlight that com,

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,250
if you go to Joe Rogan.net
and click the link,

27
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,490
you will get 15 percent off so you get a
discount on your masturbation and 

28
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:38,070
whatever the fuck it's costs what it's 
50 bucks or 60 bucks or 100 bucks.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,700
It's worth it.
Because think about what a hooker costs 

30
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,910
and you could shoot mad loads with this 
thing.

31
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,100
I don't know though,
if you've been watching cops that,

32
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,810
some of these hookers,
like $10.

33
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,650
I mean they,
they look like $10 hookers,

34
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:57,651
but it's still.
Think you want to get a $10 hooker ever 

35
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:57,651
in life.
And Allison,

36
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,700
now speaking to $10,
what did he say?

37
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,860
How rude.
Uh,

38
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,950
we're,
we're here with Alison was alison,

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,460
I don't even know your last name.
Allison.

40
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:06,600
Shula.
Shula,

41
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,560
Allison.
Shula.

42
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,290
I know her as Allison Brock's from 
twitter,

43
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,160
r o x.
and she's Brian's friend and she's a,

44
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,220
a young and upcoming standup comedian 
doing the fucking Hollywood shuffle out 

45
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:18,930
here,
making it happen.

46
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,110
Making it real.
She's a cool chick and she rides 

47
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,110
motorcycles.
She's fucking crazy.

48
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,140
She's a [inaudible].
She's,

49
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,570
she's been brought into this world of 
slapped Brian into,

50
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,460
in place before we get started with 
anything entertaining.

51
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,650
Um,
uh,

52
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,950
this weekend Ari and I are going to be 
at the West Palm Beach Improv.

53
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,990
I'd see a 28th,
29th,

54
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:43,090
and 30th and Brian's gonna be there too.
We're going to have a big,

55
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,330
big party.
And if you don't get mad at Brian,

56
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,360
if he's behind you making faces while 
you're taking pictures with me,

57
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,270
he'd done that.
He did stop doing it.

58
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,630
But really you had done it for six 
years.

59
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,650
Yeah,
six plus years and maybe taking a 

60
00:02:59,650 --> 00:02:59,650
hundred and 50,000
pictures.

61
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,610
You've really for real.
Might've taken $150,000

62
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,960
if not more than that.
Think about all the UFC is all the 

63
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:06,990
comedy shows for six years over and over
and over again.

64
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,220
Hundreds of people in night.
Crazy buffets.

65
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,640
If you have any of these pictures,
where can people send them?

66
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,080
We should create a gmail.
Wait,

67
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:17,380
we had one on my space for awhile.
Until you did.

68
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:18,500
You ended up deleting it?
No,

69
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,140
I can't.
I try to delete it.

70
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,720
We'll let these fucks.
My plates are so tricky.

71
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,220
Like yeah,
we'll get back to you with an email.

72
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,140
It's like a girl that you could never 
break up with.

73
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,420
I'll call you back and then we'll break 
up the pitch.

74
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:33,421
Never called you back.
You guys should make a tab on your 

75
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:33,421
webpage.

76
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:33,421
So just has those photos.
Like a photo gallery.

77
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:33,490
We.
Yeah,

78
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,690
we should totally know.
They're hilarious dude.

79
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,090
It's,
you know what's not funny?

80
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,440
Three of them.
You know what's funny?

81
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,580
300,000
dollars.

82
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,200
That's when it gets funny.
If becomes hilarious because it was 

83
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,461
just,
you just fucking committed to that shit 

84
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:47,461
for so long.
Like I would be like,

85
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,490
this guy's a monster.
He's fucking.

86
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,040
People give up on shit.
They have a silly idea and,

87
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:56,041
and they give up on it.
Brian will fucking ride that boat right 

88
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,620
into the ground.
It's the beach.

89
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:59,530
He still in the boat.
Boom.

90
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,320
And has to hit the rocks for he stops 
and he,

91
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,330
he's a,
he's a determined little fella.

92
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,890
Gets crazy ideas.
And he said,

93
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,980
well that's why videos are so good.
Because if they,

94
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,290
if he wasn't so determined,
he wouldn't keep going,

95
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,110
you know,
he has like all this cool footage and he

96
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:15,610
puts it together,
but that's not enough.

97
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,640
You know,
he always has to add like a million 

98
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,340
different things and sound tweaks and 
very under appreciated.

99
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,930
It's like drive both motivation.
It's like really nice when you meet 

100
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,641
people like that and we're going to 
figure out a way to make money off your 

101
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:31,170
fucking video skills do because you look
at other people's videos online.

102
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,800
I look at your videos,
dude,

103
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:35,580
you got some fucking mad talent when it 
was a video.

104
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,950
A big problem though,
is that when,

105
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,050
when I do it,
I do so many layers and so many little 

106
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,500
things that no one will ever know.
Notice,

107
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,510
you know,
it's just like in my head like crazy 

108
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:48,510
person.
Like if I were to ever do that,

109
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:48,920
like do notice.
Yeah.

110
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:49,840
There's.
So there's a,

111
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,660
there's a artistic quality to these 
videos.

112
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:54,880
It's fun and it makes it,
it's an extra layer.

113
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:59,881
It's like,
it's like the nuttiness and when you're 

114
00:04:59,881 --> 00:04:59,881
sipping wine taste.

115
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:04,720
I tasted oak,
it squeezes the last brain juice out of 

116
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:04,720
my brain though and after I do one it 
is,

117
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,320
I just want to fucking cry.
You don't want to do a long time.

118
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,390
I've been with Brian on both times of 
where he's kicked the power to was 

119
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,261
computer and losses project because the 
whole thing shuts down because my 

120
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:17,740
fucking office sucks because you've got 
numb feet,

121
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,380
motherfucker.
You're walking.

122
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,730
Well you what?
Yours is exit pretty good.

123
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:26,731
But like underneath my desk it's just 
every single wire and the power cord 

124
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:28,660
like this is updated.
This is updated.

125
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,090
That's one of the reasons why I wanted 
to get those cord ties.

126
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:33,070
We got caught,
we redid the whole thing.

127
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:34,870
You don't give a fuck because you're 
just listening,

128
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,200
most of you.
But uh,

129
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,220
we for the longest time I just figured,
well I'll make it look like a living 

130
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,050
room and we'll sit around and so I got 
couches but couches fucking suck.

131
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:49,350
You know,
like if you're sitting up and you're 

132
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,350
trying to talk to people like these are 
comfortable way better.

133
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,750
This is way better.
So we've got office chairs and we got a 

134
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,670
circular snort cocaine off this table.
If you want to do that,

135
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,350
dude,
you should start bad habits.

136
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,490
Been living my life.
Good too long.

137
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,950
Start talking.
Start fucking up.

138
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,290
You don't know about them because they 
kind of want to be like,

139
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,830
yeah,
you know what I think we're going to 

140
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,201
have to do.
We're going to have to get those ones 

141
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,611
that you have like on the radio,
like when you go to open anthony and I 

142
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:12,611
have like an arm to arm.
Yeah,

143
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:13,010
we've got to get an arm.
Yeah,

144
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:14,480
I have those at my house.
They always break,

145
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,670
but I think I got cheap ones so maybe 
they make better ones.

146
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,970
We've just got to talk to someone when 
we do radio in West Palm,

147
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,680
we'll find out where they buy their 
arms.

148
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,000
Can't wait.
Look it up.

149
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,490
It's going to be fucking crazy.
So please tell me what you were telling 

150
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,520
me before we started the podcast.
What made you stop?

151
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:34,980
Because it was so ridiculous.
We had to talk about this in the air.

152
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,450
Oh,
John Travolta is starring in the new God

153
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
movie.
He plays John Gotti ads as the lead

154
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,640
roll.
Okay.

155
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:49,641
Listen,
this had to have been a plot by the 

156
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:49,641
government.
If what?

157
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:50,460
God is dead right.
He died in prison,

158
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:50,880
didn't.
Yeah,

159
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,180
I was saying they're just trying to fuck
with them.

160
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,530
They're trying to kill him while I was 
in jail.

161
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,920
This is a plot dead.
Is he still alive?

162
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,330
I don't know,
Dude.

163
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:03,630
I remember when I was a kid and this 
whole John Gotti thing was going down.

164
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,840
I guess I wasn't too kid like I was.
I guess I was in my twenties when he was

165
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:10,020
in his prime and it was so weird.
I was like,

166
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:13,560
I didn't understand it.
It was like he was so mocking of the law

167
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:16,080
enforcement just walking down the street
with fucking,

168
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,690
you know,
$10,000

169
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,220
suits on and get in the limousines.
And it was like,

170
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:21,630
Whoa,
like this guy doesn't.

171
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,430
He's,
he's ridiculous.

172
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,470
I watched a documentary on the history 
channel.

173
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,210
That's not how they're supposed to do 
it.

174
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,060
The whole thing about the mob was that 
they were all like in the,

175
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,120
on the dl,
like everybody was staying like Vincent 

176
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,080
the Chin Gigante,
he's a famous monster,

177
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,090
you know,
one of the reasons why he's famous 

178
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,090
because he pretended to be.
He was running everything,

179
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,340
but he pretended to be completely insane
because he knew they were after him,

180
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,880
so he would walk around with slippers on
and a bathrobe over his clothes and just

181
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:49,200
walked on the street and talk to 
himself.

182
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:52,380
And he would do it all fucking day and 
it kept him.

183
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,100
He's crazy.
You can't say he's not crazy.

184
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,080
So everything he says is fucking 
useless.

185
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:03,081
This guy's nuts.
Does he or does he not walk down the 

186
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:03,090
street and his underwear talking to 
himself all day long?

187
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,980
Everyday.
Well,

188
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,620
yes,
your honor.

189
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:09,621
He does,
but I don't think that there's no more 

190
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:09,621
talking.
This guy walks in,

191
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:09,630
is under it.
Well,

192
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:11,370
we think he's faking it.
How can you prove?

193
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,980
And then everybody's faking it.
They just want free food.

194
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,320
Who doesn't want free food and a bed?
There's no crazy people.

195
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,120
They're just pretending to be crazy.
So you take care of him,

196
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,620
you know,
he can't say that.

197
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,810
You can't judge whether or not someone's
crazy,

198
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:25,080
but whoever fucking thought that John 
Travolta should be John Gotti.

199
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:25,920
That motherfucker.

200
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,200
That's crazy.
That's funny though.

201
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,660
It's revenge from the government.
Yeah.

202
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,410
That's hilarious.
And let's see,

203
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,210
who could we make his son?
Oh,

204
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:36,440
his son is being cast by a that the guy,
Justin Bieber.

205
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:38,600
James Franco.
Which you who?

206
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,990
Yeah.
Who also has some Gaydar action going on

207
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,700
on his side.
He didn't.

208
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:46,430
He play a gay guy.
Harvey milk played it.

209
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:48,840
Very well know.
So to Shaun King,

210
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,980
just heterosexual.
Just kidding.

211
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,460
That's the trick.
Knee hating.

212
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,350
No,
it is you hate.

213
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,480
But it is true.

214
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,040
Your DNA.
You from the

215
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,650
idea of kissing men,
even if it's for a fucking movie,

216
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,810
you know,
it's like I got good news and bad news.

217
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,360
Oh,
okay.

218
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,520
Hit me with the good news.
Dude.

219
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,400
You're going to be a fucking movie star.
Shut up for real.

220
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,560
Like a fucking movie.
Cool.

221
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,710
My playing with.
Dude,

222
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:09,990
you're playing with Sean Penn.
Shut the fuck up.

223
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,230
I'm coStar with sean penn.
Dude,

224
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,420
what's up?
What's up is he gets to fuck you in this

225
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:20,421
movie.
What's up is you have to make out with 

226
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:23,031
sean penn.
Could you Imagine always wanted to work 

227
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:23,031
with sean penn.
He was a brilliant actor.

228
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:25,710
Always imagined standing there with him 
at an award show.

229
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,820
We're both wearing suits and shit.
We thank the academy were all respeCted 

230
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,341
and loved and here this motherfucker is 
right there at the door right at the 

231
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,010
gate,
but now he's going to make out with Sean

232
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,910
Penn.
What would you do?

233
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,770
What would not do it?
I know.

234
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,590
No,
I'm not interesteD in acting is acting.

235
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:45,591
To me.
It would have to be something really 

236
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:45,591
fun.
Like I would love to play like wolverine

237
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:45,990
and an x men movie,
you know,

238
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:47,570
if there wasn't already guy that played 
it like that.

239
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,010
If they offered me something like that,
I'm like,

240
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,280
dude,
I'd love to be wolverine.

241
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,460
I'd get on roids to play wolverine.
Like I need to get yoked,

242
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,710
you know?
But like

243
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,910
that would be a spad as wolverine by the
way.

244
00:09:56,911 --> 00:10:00,540
That'd be crazy because actually need 
just training to do what?

245
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:05,541
That Wesley snipes fight.
That never happened and you became a 

246
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,270
crazy bad ass and I can even imagine 
like throwing wolverine into the mix.

247
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:06,620
That would have been

248
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,970
so much fun.
That wesley snipes thing obsessed me for

249
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,020
two months.
I'm really lucky that that didn't 

250
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,020
happen.
If I went out fighting him and liking it

251
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,060
and then keeping them in 10 years from 
now,

252
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:21,061
I'm just fucking completely gone.
I'm just forgetting where I leave my 

253
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:21,500
keys every five minutes.
You know,

254
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,230
you're not supposed to start fighting 
when you're like 43 where I was.

255
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,820
I was 36,000,
37.

256
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:30,821
Then.
That's what's crazy about this hershel 

257
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:34,181
walker character,
you know herschel walker football 

258
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:36,251
player,
you know the story behind this swipe 

259
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:36,251
this,
this 48 years old.

260
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:37,190
Okay.
Heisman trophy winner.

261
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:42,370
Super athlete just as fucking prime 
example of like perfect athleticism.

262
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,130
But this was a long time ago,
a long,

263
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:47,330
long,
long time ago.

264
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,130
And in this whole time where he hasn't 
been playing football,

265
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:53,330
it's just been a few years.
He stayed in insane shape.

266
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,510
I mean the guy's like super fucking 
dedicated to training and now he's like 

267
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,451
48 years old.
Going to be 49 soon and he's fighting 

268
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:01,730
this weekend on strikeforce and 
showtime.

269
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,000
It's become like an mma fighter.
It's kind of fun,

270
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,590
but it's okay because he could still 
fight and all that,

271
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:07,150
but he's just not going to repair as 
fast.

272
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,900
If he gets injured,

273
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,730
he's an amazing shape or it just doesn't
even make sense.

274
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:13,940
There was no 48 year olds that were 
built like that when I was a kid.

275
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,970
When you were 48,
you were someone's dad and maybe had 

276
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,660
like old man strength in your arms,
but you probably had a pot belly,

277
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,760
you know,
or at least a little bit of a gut and 

278
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:24,760
you know you're probably scary because 
you know you would.

279
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,770
You would hit someone first,
but no one looked like fucking herschel 

280
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:29,770
walker.
Yeah.

281
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,190
He doesn't look like an old man that you
shouldn't fuck with

282
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,690
flex body or something ridiculous,
full fucking eight pack.

283
00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:38,870
Just totally shredded.
Not an ounce of fat on his body.

284
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,350
And here's the crazy shit he says.
He only eats soup and salad.

285
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:47,351
he has one meal a day,
like everything about this guy screams 

286
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:49,160
that he's a fucking alien or bullshit.
I only eats super sad.

287
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,030
It's all water soluble.
He'd be dying.

288
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,900
It needs meet.
What iS water soluble like?

289
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:56,290
Yeah,
you will.

290
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,310
You need Protein salad right through the
soup.

291
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,080
It's liquid.
You know,

292
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,690
what's he doing?
That's crazy.

293
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,850
Right?
But why does he say that?

294
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:04,590
Well,
there.

295
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,630
Here's the other thing,
beCause he wants to.

296
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,880
He his,
his game.

297
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,500
Your dad probably,
but.

298
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,910
Well he's obviously fucking insanely 
dedicated but he might be crazy like for

299
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:13,720
legit,
crazy,

300
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,550
like he's like had like a bunch of 
mental,

301
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,680
a bunch of mental health issues in the 
past.

302
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,770
The point where he has like some sort of
a.

303
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,990
He has more than one personality.
Was that multiple personalities?

304
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:29,290
Yeah.
So maybe the part that works out is 

305
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,641
different than the part that talks.
The part that talks doesn't get access 

306
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:35,821
to all the interstate shape.
This guy's right up my alley dating 

307
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:40,420
period.
It's a funny thing when you find 

308
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:40,420
yourself date and crazy person just to 
get some posting.

309
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,030
Every guy has done it.
Allison,

310
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,730
I think it goes both ways.
I've had my share of crazies.

311
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,900
Is it just to have a boyfriend?
Like fuck it.

312
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:52,901
I just know it's like where they are 
cool for six months and then all of a 

313
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:55,501
sudden it's like what happened to you?
Like they get comfortable with you and 

314
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:55,501
know how,
like what does it freak you out?

315
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:56,620
So then they Start being their weird 
ourselves.

316
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,650
Then you're like,
where did the cool person go that I 

317
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:01,650
said,
well,

318
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,740
there is some kind of game when you 
first start dating where you're trying 

319
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,991
to be cooler than you are with them,
and then you start farting key in life 

320
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:08,200
is to become that Person.

321
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,470
Become that person who when you first 
meet somebody and you can,

322
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:16,471
it's just we get lazy.
You know you really are that person at 

323
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:17,410
your very best unless you're just a 
complete sociopath and you're absolutely

324
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:19,540
bullshitting about it.
I fucking loved dogs.

325
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,010
MeanwHile,
you're deathly allergic.

326
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,070
You know you could be one of those meds,
but if not,

327
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,750
you know that's what everybody should 
aspire to,

328
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:30,751
right?
You should aspire to be the person that 

329
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:30,751
you pretend you are when you're trying 
to get laid.

330
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:30,751
I could've took that creamer in my 
coffee,

331
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,420
but I said,
no,

332
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:33,350
I'm allergic to.
Why would you take creamer?

333
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,540
Nobody gives a shit if he of creamer in 
your coffee or not.

334
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,780
It's Actually more of a bold choice if 
you have no cream.

335
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,170
whenever someone wants black coffee and 
which you don't even give a fuck about 

336
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:43,170
flavor.
so crazy.

337
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:43,930
I started drinking coffee black.

338
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,170
I've been trying to sneak a dairy into 
her diet without her knowing lately just

339
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,600
because she's allergic to dairy.
Ladies and gentleman.

340
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,690
Yeah.
Well she has this thing,

341
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:53,500
you know,
she's like,

342
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,540
I,
if someone ever farted around me,

343
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,120
I would just in that relationship,
I wouldn't matter who,

344
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,250
who would be in stuff like that.
So now I'm like,

345
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:05,251
oh yeah,
we'll see what happens if you start 

346
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:05,890
shitting yourself.
So when you were trying to do is get her

347
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:07,680
sick because she won't let you.
Right.

348
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,240
Wow.
What a grown up.

349
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,690
By the way,
that kind of 36.

350
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,370
Brian's a grown ass man.
I'm in over my head or trying to get you

351
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:23,371
to fart.
I was just acting like that crazy 

352
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:23,371
person.
Oh,

353
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:23,371
okay.
No,

354
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:25,920
I don't think they added that logically.
You had like a ria.

355
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,880
You're like a nice road.
That was premeditated.

356
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:32,881
Yeah.
That ain't going to jail for a lot 

357
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:32,881
longer from that shit you think?
Yeah.

358
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:33,880
You got to walk there and pretend you're
crazy.

359
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,300
I don't even like illegal.
You have to come up With some some 

360
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,200
reason for people to think you're crazy.
No.

361
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,470
My mom would ask me,
allison,

362
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:46,471
juvie.
Gridlocks wasn't tolerant or is it all 

363
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:46,471
in your head?
And I'm like,

364
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:47,020
why the fuck would it be all in my head 
doing that to myself?

365
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,450
People that believe that everything's 
all in your head.

366
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:51,980
All allergies can be with no,

367
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,940
they can't.
Stupid.

368
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:58,020
right?
Babies are allergic to peanuts and you 

369
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,020
give them.
They die,

370
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,430
but you're not allowed to give babies 
peanut butter because you have to find 

371
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,430
out if they're fucking allergic to 
peanuts.

372
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,870
How do you find out?
You got to find out

373
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,980
your milk.
Your milk thing happened later in your 

374
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,231
life.
so is there something that broke your 

375
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:10,231
mail,
your milk?

376
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:10,231
Uh,
yeah.

377
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:10,450
What,
what was it?

378
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:15,451
You just had five cheese pizzas when I 
was 15 years old and in the lunch line 

379
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:16,900
they had these like cheese and a bagels 
that were so good.

380
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,840
So I got one and I ate it and I was 
supposed to meet this guy had a crush on

381
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:22,600
afterschool and I'm walking into his 
house and halfway through I'm like,

382
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,270
jesus christ,
I can't walk any for.

383
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,200
Yeah.
I'm like,

384
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:27,820
mom picked me up because I didn't drive 
yet.

385
00:15:27,821 --> 00:15:28,870
So he'd pick me up.
I'm like,

386
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,360
stop at mcdonald's.
And she's like,

387
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:32,200
what's going on?
I'm like,

388
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,900
I don't fucking know.
The next day I tested it out again.

389
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,460
She ran in the bathroom and the battle 
was over.

390
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,920
Did you even check to see if the 
toilet's clean?

391
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,400
Sort of a cleansing.
It was a cleansing.

392
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,990
Yeah.
Fucking dirty thing man.

393
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:49,991
When you have to take a shit in a public
toilet rub and sweaty ass with some 

394
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,770
stranger in everybody's sweats on those 
things,

395
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:52,070
man.

396
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,270
Yeah.
Seat cover.

397
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,570
the seat covers are stupid too.
and then like when you're done with it 

398
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,160
and it kind of grabs onto the water and 
flushes down with it,

399
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:04,161
you know,
that little arm and shit smeared all 

400
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:04,161
over it.
Okay.

401
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:07,830
They always look stupid.
It never looks like it's supposed to be 

402
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:07,830
that way.
It never looks neat and tidy.

403
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,640
So you go in there and blast out of your
ass.

404
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,440
And then what?
Did you not go to this guy's house?

405
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,550
No.
Wow.

406
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,980
I never knew what could have happened.
Crush like man's confidence.

407
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,150
You could have changed his whole life.
So that over.

408
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,330
And

409
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,290
we actually wound up dating though.
They're a high school.

410
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,780
So that was the thing though.
That pushed it over the edge.

411
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,280
That was your last year,
first thing,

412
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,700
that and that ever since then,
anything you were maybe,

413
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:28,770
which is the.
Have you tried just to eat a pizza?

414
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,550
Yeah.
Um,

415
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,340
I could do with like lactose enzymes,
which is like the supplement,

416
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:37,341
like lactaid or something and pizza.
But if I have it without like five 

417
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:38,260
minutes later.
So that just gives your body.

418
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,380
That's interesting.
have you ever tried raw milk?

419
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,220
Um,
no.

420
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:43,050
I've tried almond milk.
And all that

421
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,460
raw milk has a that it's not pasteurized
or homogenized,

422
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:51,461
so it's got all the live cultures in it 
and it's supposed to be much easier to 

423
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:54,850
digest.
I've had a bunch of times at whole 

424
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:54,850
foods,
but I don't think they carry it anymore.

425
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,871
I'm not sure if they do,
but I couldn't find it the other day 

426
00:16:58,871 --> 00:16:58,871
because a lot of people think it's 
creepy because it's,

427
00:16:58,871 --> 00:17:03,571
you know,
it's just fucking run out of the cow's 

428
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:03,571
tit.
Yeah.

429
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:03,571
And it's in like five days.
It's terrible.

430
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:04,790
And like after the first couple of days 
is good,

431
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:09,791
but it's kind of not healthy.
That milk just sits in your fucking 

432
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,640
refrigerator for two weeks and doesn't 
go bad.

433
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,770
That seems like the worst milk you could
ever drink though.

434
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:14,570
That seems like the most hardest core 
milk.

435
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,580
Every job's a tv and yeah it is.
When they milked the cow though,

436
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:24,080
a lot of the times they get feces on 
their hands when they're milking

437
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,810
a little feces.
Feces in your diet keeps you strong.

438
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,480
You need to.
You need to have battles.

439
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,500
We did the your immune system,
you know,

440
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:34,350
like,
like when you get a flu,

441
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:37,560
it's good for your immune system,
your immune system fires up and the next

442
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:40,170
time the food comes around,
the immune system is not so fast.

443
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:41,850
Bitch.
That's why I never get the flu shot.

444
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:46,851
Or we'd get a little poop in your body 
and your body and then you could fight 

445
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:46,851
off disease better.

446
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:48,400
We had this podcast last night,
that naughty show,

447
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,060
podcast number.
We had this porn star

448
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:55,060
on it and she was talking about how she 
right after the shoes,

449
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,190
I forget what it was.
She was getting fucked in the ass or 

450
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,250
something like that.
And then never in life should you ever 

451
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,030
be in a position where like I was 
getting fucked,

452
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,270
you know,
whatever,

453
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:11,520
whatever her name iS,
kelly divine,

454
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:12,840
you should go look at her twitter.
Okay.

455
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:17,930
So you can get a better idea of what she
looks like and no one's going to cause 

456
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,240
your twitter Page.
And bree olson,

457
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,820
olson's twitter page every day is about,
oh my god,

458
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:22,990
my pussy sore suck.
So much cock last night.

459
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,580
Just like everyday it's like more and 
more brutal.

460
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,450
Crazy.
There's so much that a guy With a two 

461
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:32,450
inch dick would make it feel like a 
fucking,

462
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,320
a 10 inch or like she said,
that felt like her tweets.

463
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,070
What's.
yeah,

464
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,130
what's crazy is though,
after he pulled out his dick out a real 

465
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:40,130
ass.

466
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,330
Yeah,
after he pulled out his dick out of her 

467
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,630
as he puts it in her mouth and he said 
it was just caked with shit,

468
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,660
just so much shit that you know.
And then he fucked her in the mouth and 

469
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,461
then in between shoots she had to go to 
the bathroom and she said she spent for 

470
00:18:55,461 --> 00:18:58,530
like 15 minutes picking shit out from 
her teeth and she didn't have any like,

471
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:00,180
toothpicks or toothpaste.
So she was like,

472
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,600
hi,
what do they pay you for that?

473
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,360
Oh my.
I think it Was like three we own,

474
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,170
but from this guy's dick real.
I've never seen that in a movie,

475
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:12,540
but I've seen a lot of astrobiology and 
I'm always.

476
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,750
I always have the same reaction.
Why is that necessary?

477
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,210
Do we really need to do this?
Turn someone on?

478
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,580
I asked them a lot of people on fucking 
dirty I.

479
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,580
Yeah,
and I asked them and does it ever get 

480
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,121
better?
does it like turn into chocolate after 

481
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:29,121
awhile where you're just like looking 
forward to some shit in your mouth,

482
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:29,760
you know,
and she's like,

483
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,360
they're like,
no.

484
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:31,700
It never ever.
Every time.

485
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,300
How many times has she gotten shit?
Her mouth.

486
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:34,850
Well,
I guess that's pretty common when you,

487
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:37,860
you,
you do a lot of asda mouth and.

488
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:40,830
But she said that she was just saying 
this one time and take care of god.

489
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,260
That is so crazy.
They pay me all the money in the world.

490
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,720
Part of it is that other girls are doing
it.

491
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,660
All you need is one girl to do it and 
it's such a weird thing.

492
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,870
If oNe girl does porn where she left a 
guy pissed at her mouth and every girl 

493
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,110
is going to start letting go and pitch 
their mouths.

494
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,360
It's a weird thing.
It's like all of a sudden that's become 

495
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,360
like,
yeah,

496
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,060
It raises the bar and that,
that becomes acceptable to us now asked 

497
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,060
to mouth when I was a kid.
No.

498
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,880
Okay.
When you got a ginger,

499
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,380
lynn,
peter north porno,

500
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:09,530
they had sex at the most.
He shot it in her mouth and it was 

501
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,721
pretty hot,
but it didn't stick it in her ass and 

502
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:11,721
then put her mouth.
But that's like standard today.

503
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:13,400
Yeah,
well that's not anymore.

504
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,540
No,
just under a load in an open mouth.

505
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,060
It's like,
oh,

506
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,230
not this again.
I mean literally you can go on 

507
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,320
[inaudible] dot com and look up loads in
the mouth and there'll be like a fucking

508
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:28,321
100,000
videos of girls with their mouths open 

509
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:30,531
and guys jerking off in their mouth.
She goes through this website you need 

510
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:31,230
to check out because every time she's on
it I'm just like,

511
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,160
wow,
that's a cool video,

512
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:37,161
but I have a feeling it's one of his 
websites that everybody goes to and I 

513
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:37,161
was just the last to know about it.

514
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:38,010
What's it called?
today's big thing?

515
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:39,770
Dot com.
I Think I've heard of that before.

516
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,910
It's great.
What is it?

517
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,940
It's just everyday they have this crazy 
new videos and stuff like that.

518
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Like they have this one and I do.
They have this one video on there right 

519
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,240
now.
It was doing cellos,

520
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,060
have saw that on twitter,
but I didn't click the link and you got 

521
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,160
to watch it because it's like they're 
trying to be really hard to see what.

522
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,180
I'm sorry.
Do you want to join cellos for the song?

523
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,570
Um,
that an internet,

524
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,950
internet,
internet net.

525
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,290
Oh,
mIchael jackson's beat it.

526
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,830
No,
no,

527
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:13,630
no.
It's the one that I'm the band also 

528
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:13,630
resaying.
Yeah.

529
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:13,630
Speed it.
No,

530
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,350
it's not beat it.
It's not smooth.

531
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,540
Criminal.
Yeah.

532
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,450
Yeah.
So we're so wide and so,

533
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,380
so it's um,
so there's like,

534
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,930
like playing the cello,
why?

535
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:27,931
They're both looking at each other and 
they're trying to be hardcore and stuff 

536
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:31,920
and then it starts going the hips thing 
and just being like they're fighting but

537
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:34,410
they're playing cellos and are staring 
at it.

538
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:39,430
It's just,
it gets really good and then it turns 

539
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,470
into them like in this weird part where 
they're like wrestling in his bedroom or

540
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:43,090
something like that.
Or in a bar.

541
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:45,910
I don't even know what it is.
A dark room and cellos are amazing.

542
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,970
Yeah.
The cellos are amazing things that you 

543
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:50,970
can sell advertising today.
If you have guys kissing,

544
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,590
do you think you could sell sell things?
Yeah,

545
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
you could.
You could have girls kissing and you 

546
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000
could still sell a porsche.
Yeah,

547
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000
you know,
but if you have,

548
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,770
could you imagine,
could you imagine if portion,

549
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:05,470
just like the new ceo just had this 
wacky idea.

550
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,890
What I think we need to do is capture 
the gay market.

551
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,940
We are missing the gay market.
We'll take chance to push a name is sol 

552
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,810
in the american culture.
They love our cars and this guy just 

553
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:18,810
takes a while chance.

554
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,490
So it's just going to get that gay 
market to just has to guys like making 

555
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,290
out in front of a cayenne,
put hands in the pockets and shit.

556
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,320
You know what the fuck.
And everybody just abandoned them to 

557
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,800
audi.
Fuck you bitches.

558
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,600
Fuck your stupid rear engine car.
And they get so many complaints for like

559
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,960
pta mothers.
yeah.

560
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:42,961
But why?
How come if it was a girl and a girl 

561
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:42,961
kissing with aca compliance only from 
fat chicks,

562
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,980
it'd be the only ones complaining.
A few families taking their oversize 

563
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,110
hands to cover their teenage sons eyes 
while he's watching tv.

564
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,930
Fuck.
I would rather see two girls kissing.

565
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,880
Then two guys kissing.
Yeah,

566
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,970
because that's the first two guys 
kissing to get much more Likely rape.

567
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:06,420
That Is weird though.
That two guys to me still if they're 

568
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,110
kissing right in front of me is 
tolerable as I am.

569
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,940
I'm still kind of like,
eh,

570
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,050
because tolerant as you are.
If you're tolerant,

571
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,830
that's debatable god.
Except for yourself.

572
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,730
Yeah.
This is a genetic thing,

573
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:23,170
right?
Do you feel like it's genetic?

574
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,680
I guess I'm not judgmental at all.
I don't have any problem with anybody 

575
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,470
doing anything that doesn't hurt anybody
else.

576
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,070
If you want to be gay,
be gay.

577
00:23:31,071 --> 00:23:34,330
It doesn't bother me at all,
but it weirds me out when I'm around gay

578
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:37,210
guys there making out.
I've been like as close as you are to me

579
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,570
and two guys were were holding hands and
then they just moved in and started 

580
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,010
kissing each other into your bed.
No to outside.

581
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,790
I remember distinctly saying,
okay,

582
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,500
don't panic.
You know,

583
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:52,460
like my boss.
I was like,

584
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:57,461
don't don't get uncomfortable,
just move away slowly palpitating but 

585
00:23:57,461 --> 00:23:57,560
yelling.
Whoa.

586
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,220
They're bugging right now.
Right here.

587
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,980
It's,
it's,

588
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,040
it's so juvenile.
It's like I completely support your 

589
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,040
right to do it and I think I'd look at 
fucking.

590
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,761
Sometimes it's pretty gross When,
when men and women are doing it in 

591
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:12,551
public,
it was just a lot of people that get 

592
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,351
fucking sloppy makeout sessions in 
public and it gets pretty narrow 

593
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:14,351
statement.
Yeah,

594
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:14,351
I support that.
Do that.

595
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:19,210
I don't have a problem with that.
I don't have a problem with anybody 

596
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,521
doing it.
But you got to let gay people straight 

597
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:21,521
people do.
Oh,

598
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:21,521
absolutely.
I have nothing against it.

599
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:25,990
It's just,
I'm just saying it's weird that like I 

600
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:25,990
don't,
I could see my two girls kissing,

601
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,430
you know,
my mom doesn't care of two girls were 

602
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:30,430
kissing.

603
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:30,430
What is your feeling when you see two 
guys kissing?

604
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,940
I feel vulnerable.
I feel like don't try to just me.

605
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,790
I like,
if they wouldn't have nothing to do with

606
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:35,360
me,
man,

607
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,540
you know,
I'm telling you at the time it doesn't 

608
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:40,540
matter,
but it's like with a.

609
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,490
If you know that you're for sure around 
a guy who's into guys and it's like all 

610
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,051
of a sudden you're in a,
you're in a completely different like 

611
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:48,320
roll,
you know,

612
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:48,890
you'll,
you'll like,

613
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,260
you can be pursued now,
right?

614
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,720
You could be pursued by a dude like,
no,

615
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:51,940
no,
no,

616
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,200
no,
no,

617
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:52,480
no,
no,

618
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:52,790
no,
no,

619
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,270
no,
no.

620
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,450
Even though,
you know,

621
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:59,451
I,
I know they don't want everything to do 

622
00:24:59,451 --> 00:24:59,451
with me.
It doesn't matter.

623
00:24:59,451 --> 00:24:59,451
I've seen instincts like get the fuck 
away.

624
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:04,250
Yeah.
I've seen two guys kissing and I just 

625
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:04,250
kinda like watched because I was like,
that's interesting.

626
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:04,500
It just looks different,
you know,

627
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,820
like far as looking at it an alien or 
investigating it.

628
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,480
I wish I would if I could be a neuter 
for a day.

629
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,750
That's how I feel.
Neutering people.

630
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,180
No,
no.

631
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,560
Like if I wasn't a man or a woman,
if I could be sexless for a day,

632
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,290
then I could probably look at it like 
that and like to look at it like that.

633
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:20,800
Like,
you know,

634
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:23,170
from a scientific point of view in my 
boss is fascinating.

635
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,380
Like what is that like?
That's their return on like I don't 

636
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,040
understand like when girls,
anytime a girl is ever been attracted to

637
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,520
me,
I've always been like really?

638
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,290
Like,
what the fuck do you like?

639
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,520
You like guys,
you know,

640
00:25:33,521 --> 00:25:34,780
you like,
like what do you like?

641
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,360
You know,
like it's ridiculous.

642
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,470
Like it doesn't make any sense.
You know,

643
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,920
for a man,
it doesn't make any sense that women are

644
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:46,921
attracted to men.
I understand they do have a long 

645
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:47,290
lifelong history of experience of seeing
it.

646
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:49,300
Seeing girls be attracted to men.
So I know it's real.

647
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,700
Right?
But I don't get it.

648
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,220
But when it's a guy and a guys attracted
to a guy,

649
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,360
then it's like,
whoa,

650
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:57,210
this is like super alien.
right?

651
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:02,270
We just don't know it.
Something we've never lived or 

652
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:02,270
experienced,
you know?

653
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:02,370
We're never going to be able to know 
what that feels.

654
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,030
And that's,
that's weird with like kids that's weird

655
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:09,350
with like guys that are into like 
fucking horses and all that shit.

656
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:13,900
Like how do you get the that that's even
going to fucking.

657
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,790
your brain just is broken.
Some people's brains just don't work

658
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,430
work.
Right?

659
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,460
Right.
They just attacked by a man with a foot 

660
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:22,460
fetish at laguna beach.
Tell,

661
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,970
won't tell them the cops and everything.
I'm on.

662
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,430
I'm on the internet now.
Um,

663
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,430
okay.
So anyway,

664
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:31,431
I'm at the,
I'm at looking at beach with an ex 

665
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:31,431
boyfriend and we're smoking some weed on
the rocks looking at the ocean.

666
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,650
This guy walks up and he a camera in his
hands and he's like,

667
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,020
I think your style is really cool and 
really beautiful.

668
00:26:37,021 --> 00:26:39,870
Can I take your picture?
I'm a photography student.

669
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:40,920
I'm like,
okay,

670
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:41,880
sounds good.
Mike,

671
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,960
do you mind if I smoke weed?
It's like,

672
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:48,190
so I keep smoking.
And he started taking my picture and 

673
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:48,360
he's being really cool and he's like,
can I have you take off your shoes?

674
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,980
And I'm like,
uh,

675
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:51,210
okay.
I think we're at the beach.

676
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:52,470
I guess this is fitting,
you know,

677
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,690
take pictures of my feet,
start snapping pictures of my feet and 

678
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,590
then all of a sudden he gets down on a 
knee and I'm like looking at him like,

679
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,830
what's this guy doing that?

680
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:04,830
And I'm like super high and all of a 
sudden he puts my foot on his face and 

681
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,120
goes,
he licked it.

682
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,900
Does that make you feel?
I'm like,

683
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:15,180
whoa.
And I'm looking at my boyfriend sitting 

684
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,721
right there and I'm like,
and I'm right in front of your 

685
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:22,071
boyfriend.
Did he not know that you were with the 

686
00:27:22,071 --> 00:27:22,071
guy?
No,

687
00:27:22,071 --> 00:27:22,071
he's,
yeah,

688
00:27:22,071 --> 00:27:22,950
he's a crazy guy.
And then I'm like,

689
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:23,730
what are you doing?
And he's like,

690
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,170
oh,
I want a foot fetish website.

691
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:28,050
It's California beach feet.com.
And he puts me up on there.

692
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:31,170
I fucking take the business card because
I'm just super stoned and I'm like,

693
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,350
what just happened?
Check out the website and I'm on there.

694
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,120
She didn't even recently just send a.
Yeah.

695
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,010
I recently emailed him and said I'm 
going to cease and desist.

696
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,520
Yeah,

697
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,530
yeah.
There's about dudes Who were into 

698
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:47,790
people's feet.
Did you save it?

699
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:53,330
The pictures,
the pictures and the video or the video 

700
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:53,520
of it that you should've saved it for.
You take that down.

701
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,740
That's great.
Oh,

702
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,060
It is 25 bucks

703
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,530
before the internet was around,
you know,

704
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,470
like back when,
you know,

705
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,280
you had like find things in magazines or
you know,

706
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:07,281
it's like,
it was a lot different if you wanted to 

707
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:07,281
see some weird shit,
you had a really,

708
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:08,080
really go out of your way to see it.
There was a,

709
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,500
a magazine called foot.
There was two.

710
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:13,860
One of them was like this lady boy 
magazine and wish I'd Remembered it.

711
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,220
I wish I remember the name of it,
what it was a magazine completely 

712
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,370
dedicated to cross dressers and they 
were like fucking marines.

713
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,560
These guys were like,
the guy works at the deli.

714
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,560
The guy was bald with a big fat head who
slices salami.

715
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,820
He wants to be a woman and he's got 
makeup on and a wig and he's like posing

716
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:34,370
like a woman and it is fucking tweaky.
It's the,

717
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,620
you knoW,
like look how lovely she looks and you 

718
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,691
know,
they'll say that what the woman named 

719
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:41,691
for his character that he plays when he 
dresses up is,

720
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,290
it's so fucking strange.

721
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,010
There's this new show coming on.
Um,

722
00:28:45,011 --> 00:28:50,011
were cross dressers,
compete Like In like some cross 

723
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:53,541
dressing,
like reality show I saw a commercial 

724
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:53,541
for.
Have you guys heard of it?

725
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:53,860
No,
I saw the billboard of it.

726
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:54,730
It's like,
so it's like,

727
00:28:54,731 --> 00:28:59,731
it's like a,
it's like a game show booth with 

728
00:28:59,731 --> 00:28:59,731
crossdressers.

729
00:28:59,731 --> 00:29:02,950
What I was going to say though is that 
there was one magazine called foot 

730
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,710
action and I remember looking at this 
going,

731
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,740
what the fuck is this?
So you got to open it up and check it 

732
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,921
out.
And it's all like dudes who jerk off on 

733
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:11,921
feet.
It's a whole thing.

734
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:16,631
It's like feet on decks and girls 
rubbing their feet on decks and it's 

735
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:20,041
like,
that's like a big fucking thing for 

736
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:20,041
dudes.

737
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,890
I don't get it.
That's for standing now for kissing 

738
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,280
magazine,
male whole magazine dedicated to its 

739
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,280
grass because that guy who took all 
those pictures on my feet,

740
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,220
I know he went home and touched himself 
to him doing it right now.

741
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:36,290
Yeah.
What the fuck is if you have a foot 

742
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:36,290
fetish,
if it has a little bit of cotton,

743
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,600
do you get hornier from it?
You know,

744
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:39,070
like if there's little cotton Between 
the toes,

745
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,050
but I would imagine it's like a little 
bit of a pussy,

746
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,000
a little

747
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,050
bit of a foot fetish when I was like 18 
or 19.

748
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,700
well,
not really.

749
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:50,930
I just thought they were attractive.
like girls who had pretty feet were 

750
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:50,930
attractive.
It helps.

751
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,140
Yeah.
Just sister sonia feet in Massachusetts.

752
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:58,850
One girls had like hubs so he goes 
walking around kicking ice since they 

753
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,990
were a baby or feed feeder.
All jack,

754
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,020
you know,
I don't have a foot fetish,

755
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:07,021
but I definitely like touching feet.
Like when I sleep I like to touch a 

756
00:30:07,021 --> 00:30:09,931
little foot.
I like to hold a foot but I don't like 

757
00:30:09,931 --> 00:30:09,931
go after a full day.
No,

758
00:30:09,931 --> 00:30:14,850
but some dudes it becomes a giant focus.
Like that's more important to them than 

759
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,231
vaginas or mouths or anything like that.
Something like ms dot firing in the 

760
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:21,280
brain when people are fucking strange 
man.

761
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,430
The way one person's brain works and 
other persons doesn't.

762
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,640
I was telling you guys about this before
we started the podcast and I saw this 

763
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,610
horrible video online or there's two 
kids are skateboarding in front of this 

764
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:36,450
guy's house and the guy comes out and 
tell them to stop skateboard and they 

765
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:36,450
are like,
fuck,

766
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,260
you can skateboard where we want,
and they they're getting sort of sort of

767
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:39,280
like a pushing,
shoving,

768
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:44,281
sort of a little situation and the man 
runs into the house and grabs a gun and 

769
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:45,880
guns down these two kids right in the 
street.

770
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,180
IT's all in the security live leak,
I'm guessing.

771
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,180
Or it was on youtube because it's not,
it's not that graphic.

772
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:55,450
You can see him shooting from a security
camera from like the front of his house.

773
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,160
Right?
It's fucking horrible.

774
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,090
You know,
when you think that,

775
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,370
you know,
an argument between someone who wants to

776
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:05,371
skateboard and some guy who doesn't want
to hear noise can turn into some man 

777
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:05,530
gunning down someone's children.
You know,

778
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,120
they're like 15,
16 years old.

779
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:07,690
They're like,
kids.

780
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:12,691
You know it.
She was so fucked up to think that 

781
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:13,750
someone's brain can actually be wired 
that way or they just want to go out and

782
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:18,751
just shoot somebody who's making too 
much noise and it's so crazy how random 

783
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:18,880
it is.
Mark,

784
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:24,150
mark marco that I was telling you about,
he was walking in north hollywood and 

785
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:24,540
some guy just came up to him the other 
day,

786
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,040
just put a gun to his head and said,
give me your wallet and your cell phone,

787
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,290
and it's like,
what can happen?

788
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,470
It can happen easy.
There was a guy out here that shot a cop

789
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,500
podcast,
last podcast.

790
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,920
Fuck man.
It's a fucking nutty world and as the 

791
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,710
economy gets shittier and shittier,
people get more and more desperate and 

792
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:43,710
more and more things like this are gonna
happen.

793
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,890
Unfortunately,
you know,

794
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,770
there's a lack of balance,
you know?

795
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:52,830
I don't know how it comes back around,
but it ain't going to come back around 

796
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,801
the way we're rocking it right now.
There's just so many fucking criminals 

797
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:56,410
to get guns.
Why don't you have one?

798
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:01,390
I just don't know.
Well,

799
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,640
I mean it's like,
all right,

800
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,210
you want to get a gun,
it's like 600 bucks.

801
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:06,580
That's a pretty big purchase,
you know that much.

802
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,910
I'm guessing like decent ones and then 
there's probably a thing that you can 

803
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,840
kill somebody and it's only 600 bucks 
cheaper than that.

804
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,160
It's probably 20 bucks.

805
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,460
If you go in the right places on the 
streets and you get a cheap gun,

806
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,870
but you have to do the class too or you 
were not collapse.

807
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:25,930
You have to sign up like two weeks 
beforehand or they have to get 

808
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,911
background checks.
Do I want to be put in the system and 

809
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:32,470
it's going to take you awhile to get it.
You want to be put in the system to be 

810
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,220
put in the system.
That protecting system.

811
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,590
Brian is a,
he's an anarchist.

812
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,620
He stays outside of the system,
hurt libertarian.

813
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,890
He does not believe in this.
Culture is right.

814
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,700
I'm not going to Canada move to 
vancouver.

815
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,650
That's why you don't vote.
Right?

816
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:47,240
So you don'T get put into the system.
Right?

817
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,880
I already got put into the system for 
the irs though,

818
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:52,670
so that fucking sucks.
But I don't knoW how that happened.

819
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,570
I didn't do anything.

820
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,610
They just check you bro.
He found me.

821
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,190
They check comics all the time.
Comics get busted all the time.

822
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,970
But the irs.
yeah.

823
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,180
ExcuSe me.
Yeah.

824
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:06,210
Yeah.
Because comics don't like the charge to 

825
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:06,210
a report.
Money.

826
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,251
Like they'll,
they'll take gigs and they'll get paid 

827
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:09,251
cash.
It was a huge,

828
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:12,320
huge problem in boston back in the day.
We all got paid cash for all these gigs.

829
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:15,830
So you got to do your own taxes and most
of these guys are lazy as fuck.

830
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,390
they didn't do anything.
They just took that money.

831
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,500
And then,
you know,

832
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:23,501
years and years of these comedy clubs 
reporting that they have these 

833
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:23,501
employees,
you know,

834
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,060
and then these guys never.
It's just really bad.

835
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,160
So a lot of them are,
you know,

836
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,660
tens of thousands of dollars,
hundreds even,

837
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:34,830
you know,
over years and years without paying 

838
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:34,830
taxes.
What do you do if you can,

839
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,300
if you can't pay that back,
you gotta pay it back,

840
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,640
pay it back slowly as quick as we can.

841
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,620
So guys,
we're working like every night guys were

842
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:42,350
taking all these crazy gigs.
Just to try to pay off their irs.

843
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:47,351
Not see.
I kept withdrawals automatically once a 

844
00:33:47,351 --> 00:33:48,710
month and then was pretty much forced.
It's the mom back to john gotti.

845
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,670
Hey.
Yeah.

846
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,850
Right.
So who the fuck else was in line for it?

847
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:56,700
Was it like barry manilow's busy.
David cassidy can't do it to anybody.

848
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,030
Dude,
she doesn't want to act anymore.

849
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:03,110
I was going to play john gotti that john
travolta is not a bad ass accurate.

850
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:08,171
Don't get me wrong,
but that's not the right guy for the 

851
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:08,171
part.
That's ridiculous.

852
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,680
That's silly.
I mean he's great and pulp fiction.

853
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,690
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not a john travolta hater.

854
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,930
What?
It had been weird if they use.

855
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Oh yeah,
I would have been kind of cool that I 

856
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,480
would have totally.
I've totally would have went for that.

857
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:26,390
Would it be a good role for stallone to 
have been something that he would want 

858
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,230
to like try hard at and stretching.
You know,

859
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,910
like when he did cop land,
like he made some,

860
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,090
some the camps a few times.
Good actor.

861
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,990
Yeah.
He can be a great actor and rocky,

862
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:38,170
but you know,
why do all that hard lifting when you 

863
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,411
could just be some bad ass,
some fucking wooden face wouldn't lyric 

864
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:41,411
movie,
you know,

865
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:43,730
that it just makes $100,000,000,000
in the box office,

866
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:45,590
you know,
he's the master of those expendable type

867
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:50,591
movies.
So they sit there and put some jersey 

868
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:50,591
shore guy in there.
I'm sick of all these jersey shore,

869
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:51,590
like ari was on a audition the other 
day,

870
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:56,591
or a commercial shoot with one of the 
guys from jersey shore and him about 

871
00:34:56,591 --> 00:34:57,590
like some,
some kind of product.

872
00:34:57,591 --> 00:34:59,390
I don't know if I'm allowed to say there
was a,

873
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,880
uh,
a picture of kim kardashian and,

874
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and she was holding hands like they were
palling around with snooki and they're 

875
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,530
both having this incredible belly laugh.
They're leaning back and they're 

876
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:16,040
laughing so hard at all I can think of 
is what are these two dumb cunt laugh?

877
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,060
What the fuck are you laughing at?
What,

878
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,410
what,
what did you w who said something funny,

879
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,250
right?
Sneaky.

880
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,100
Sneaky.
Probably forwarded them.

881
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,220
Kim kardashians.
Queef too.

882
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,790
Yeah.

883
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,170
So strange.
It's such a strange time we live in and.

884
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,630
No,
no,

885
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,030
no.
When I say dump concept,

886
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:37,540
say with all love,
I don't really think there.

887
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,200
I mean I think they're just doing their 
thing,

888
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:41,700
you know?
I got no hate for it.

889
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,040
I find it fascinating to watch that 
show.

890
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:49,041
Not one episode,
but I watched it twice or hurt your 

891
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,140
brand makes you grip the seat or you 
like what is going on.

892
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,870
Like it makes you realize like these are
real people,

893
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:53,140
man.
This jersey shore is.

894
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,820
They'll fight over anything.
He'll throw shit at each other.

895
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,340
They tackle each other and pull hair and
and turn it.

896
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,560
These crazy slap fights and they know 
cameras are on.

897
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,930
They know they don't give a fuck about 
these reality shows are,

898
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:08,931
it's like a bunch of scientists putting 
a bunch of rats in a little glass cage 

899
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:08,931
and like,
let's see,

900
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:10,230
the males meet with all the females can 
fight

901
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,360
that.
They're sendIng jersey shore to Italy 

902
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,520
for season four.
They just announced in the whatever the 

903
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,770
eu,
the italian american interest group 

904
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,160
unico or whatever it said that they're 
just pissed.

905
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,480
They are so

906
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,430
great.
Well,

907
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,310
those people aren't even all snuggies on
italian,

908
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:28,230
right?
I don't think they're all italian.

909
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,290
She's like puerto rican or something.
Don't know.

910
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,300
I've never,
I can't believe you were talking about 

911
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:35,300
them,
but we should.

912
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:40,150
it's fascinating.
We should just like when you go to the 

913
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,150
zoo and there's one monkeys throwing 
shit at the glass,

914
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,020
you want to,
you know,

915
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,080
it's not like this monkey's beneath me 
talking about him.

916
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
No man,
that's,

917
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,930
you know,
these are monkeys.

918
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,840
These jersey shore people are just a 
different type of monkey.

919
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,140
You can look at it like it's such a 
trivial thing to talk about.

920
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:54,510
Discuss.
But it's really like scientific work.

921
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,960
And what's weird is most of you would 
thing

922
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:01,640
most of them remind me of myself when I 
was like 18.

923
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,780
And I was like,
wow,

924
00:37:02,781 --> 00:37:05,920
crew palm may put my bangs up.
I'm going to go,

925
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,720
you know,
like I felt like I was.

926
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,200
But now I look back.
I'm like,

927
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:10,550
dude,
that is so embarrassing.

928
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,130
But

929
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,190
the product,
look,

930
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:13,570
this guy,
the situation,

931
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,090
he was however retarded he might come 
off.

932
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:21,010
He's obviously working very hard.
He's got like videos and exercise videos

933
00:37:21,011 --> 00:37:22,420
and he's trying to make something 
happen.

934
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,430
ProTein,
vodka.

935
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,860
I don't know.
It probably is.

936
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,640
I mean he's,
he's got a bunch of shit going on.

937
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:29,890
He's obviously trying to make the most 
of the situation,

938
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,150
you know,
when you see guys like that,

939
00:37:31,151 --> 00:37:33,490
you just got to think this is just 
someone from a different world.

940
00:37:33,491 --> 00:37:38,491
That's all it is.
It's from a world where you grow up 

941
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:38,530
around people like that and that kind of
behavior is acceptable.

942
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,710
I mean,
I never lived in jersey shore but I was 

943
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,850
born in newark and I lived in New Jersey
and I have relatives from New Jersey and

944
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:51,180
you know,
and I grew up in boston and that 

945
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:51,180
behavior is a lot more fucking common 
than you think,

946
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:56,430
you know,
and if everybody in your house behaves 

947
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:56,430
like that,
it's,

948
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:56,430
it's like,
what the fuck is that

949
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,550
on the phone?

950
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,310
If that's every day.
I mean That's a real.

951
00:38:01,311 --> 00:38:02,980
Those are real live people out there,
man.

952
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:07,990
There's a bunch of people that that's 
their everyday yelling and screaming at 

953
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:07,990
each other.
Come on,

954
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,290
bro.
This fucking guy does knoW who I am,

955
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:10,800
bro.
This guy has no am

956
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,040
glad I only had two italians growing up

957
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,820
near me or they're monkeys.
That's me.

958
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,980
So I can say it.
I'm three quarter monkey.

959
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,800
They're fucking apes there.
They're squawking apes.

960
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:24,000
They like to get on top of cars and jump
up and down and bang on.

961
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,610
I'm just like a chimp would all that 
yelling and this.

962
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,090
It's not a coincidence that they're the 
loudest motherfuckers on the planet.

963
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:33,310
You know what?
I have a lot of family in New York.

964
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:37,510
My parents are from brooklyn and all of 
my aunts are like the whole,

965
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,870
oh my god.
it's brutal.

966
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,390
But it's funny,
but it's like up there.

967
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:44,860
Well,
you know what though?

968
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:46,660
It's fun though.
They're festive people.

969
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:47,890
You know?
I'm only bullshitting that.

970
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,810
I totally hate it because they have the 
best food ever.

971
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:55,020
I would take italian food over 
everything and I am a talent three 

972
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,020
quarters of time,
so I can't be that self hating,

973
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,010
but this or that passion that makes it.

974
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,060
It's a crazy race.
You know?

975
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:01,810
There's some rakes.
Like I liked the armenians.

976
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,550
Armenians are fucking crazy,
man.

977
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,480
Have you ever,
you know,

978
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,060
I mean I know a bunch of armenians from 
the ultimate fighter,

979
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:07,850
from,
from,

980
00:39:07,851 --> 00:39:10,120
you know,
the ufc fights from just training.

981
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:15,170
A lot of,
a lot of them do jujItsu and those guys 

982
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:15,170
are fucking down to just punch you in 
the face.

983
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,960
They're wild.
They're wild dudes.

984
00:39:16,961 --> 00:39:19,750
It's like a whole race of wild dudes,
but that's just the way they are.

985
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:20,540
I mean,
you know,

986
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,020
if you're born into that situation with 
the fuck,

987
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:28,021
you know,
you know how hard it must be to try to 

988
00:39:28,021 --> 00:39:29,821
not be that if you're growing up or on 
your dad and you're in a tight knit 

989
00:39:29,821 --> 00:39:29,821
family.
So they're all together.

990
00:39:29,821 --> 00:39:34,291
They all act just like each other and 
it's fucking 10 of them in a house for 

991
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:34,291
real.
I mean if you there,

992
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,640
those are very family oriented people,
armenians,

993
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:37,300
they just,
you know,

994
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:38,520
everyone's over the house.
Grandma,

995
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:43,530
grandpa,
the other cousins are visiting it just 

996
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:43,530
like they're very family.
They're all like,

997
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,520
they're all like super like intense 
people.

998
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,770
Burbank is like filled to the top with 
armenians.

999
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:48,880
Yeah.

1000
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,900
And it's like my starbucks and stuff.
They they sit out there and play poker 

1001
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,390
and like you'd walk in and they all 
stare at you by giving you a,

1002
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,600
like,
we could trade it.

1003
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,940
My friend armand arbit,
the armenian,

1004
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,550
my friend armand was a pool player back 
in my pool plan days and he was,

1005
00:40:04,551 --> 00:40:07,190
this motherfucker would just jam.
We wanted to gamble constantly.

1006
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,000
Come on,
you've got no heart.

1007
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,080
Come on gamble.
It's a gamble.

1008
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,120
Just always wanted to gamble.
Armenians in,

1009
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,590
even in pool,
they're like aggressive,

1010
00:40:12,591 --> 00:40:12,860
right

1011
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,770
in the place where I get my haircut,
which is fantastIc.

1012
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:20,771
Sams or an $8 haircut type place and 
there are meetings and there are two 

1013
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:25,000
that are all the family members of the 
guys that are playing poker outside and 

1014
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,670
so they kind of know who you are from,
you know,

1015
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:32,710
just go into starbucks every day.
So I sit down and it's the most 

1016
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:32,930
uncomfortable haircut cut ever.
Like it fuels,

1017
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:37,931
like I always think that she's going to 
take the scissors and just stab it 

1018
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:41,291
through my head.
So that's what I'm thinking when I'm 

1019
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:41,291
getting my haircut.
I'm like,

1020
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,460
don't stab this scissors because it's 
very intense.

1021
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,700
You need to get a haircut with me and 
you want to get a scary,

1022
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:51,350
a very intense armenians or what have 
you.

1023
00:40:51,351 --> 00:40:52,100
Right.
And it's just.

1024
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,750
Which haircut is she?
Gonna fucking snap.

1025
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,920
Right.
That's what I'm saying.

1026
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:58,400
If I had those thoughts,
I wouldn't even go anymore.

1027
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,900
Well,
intuition was he.

1028
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,870
The thing is,
is I,

1029
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,340
I go to starbucks every day mixed in 
with these people.

1030
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,020
Yeah.
Keep your enemies close.

1031
00:41:06,021 --> 00:41:06,460
You know,
like,

1032
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,400
like if they start throwing grenades,
they're gonna.

1033
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,010
Be like,
hey,

1034
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,760
you better stand over here man.
You know,

1035
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,920
I'd rather have that.

1036
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,530
You want to be in with them.
So you say hi to them when you see him.

1037
00:41:18,531 --> 00:41:20,060
Hi guys.
I did the nada.

1038
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,340
Did they open the door when they're 
coming in and out?

1039
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:25,320
I know so far as to make friends with 
them.

1040
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,050
No,
no,

1041
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,850
no.
Don't do that with anybody though.

1042
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,550
I was very,
like I told you last week,

1043
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:34,510
I keep very hidden like a ninja low 
profile.

1044
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,480
Right?
Why is that?

1045
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:36,870
Careers?
I don't know.

1046
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:37,210
Easier,
right?

1047
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,230
It's easier to avoid conflict.
Absolutely.

1048
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,200
I think I talked to that old man 
building your shed in your backyard,

1049
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,080
right?
Oh yeah,

1050
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,470
absolutely.
We talked about his daughter's dogs.

1051
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,490
People that just want to start telling 
you shit about their life.

1052
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,610
Told me a lot.
It's very.

1053
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:56,710
When you get stuck with one of those 
motherfuckers and you realize like it 

1054
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:56,990
starts off as a normal conversation.
Like what's going on man?

1055
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,160
Nothing.
How you doing?

1056
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,240
No,
everythIng's good man.

1057
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:00,080
How about yourself?
Well,

1058
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:01,820
it would've been better if it wasn't for
last week.

1059
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:07,090
No,
last week my daughter married this man 

1060
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:07,090
and I tried to tell her to stay away 
from this fellow,

1061
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,210
but she didn't want to listen and you're
like,

1062
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,640
oh no,
no,

1063
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,040
fuck yeah.
So that's what I try to get out of it 

1064
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,040
and stay away from is that kind of shit.

1065
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,270
That shit is brutal.
That shit was like a beaten woman.

1066
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,880
You're afraid of men.
You become a lesbian who become a social

1067
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:24,881
lesbian.
You know who's the best ideas getting 

1068
00:42:24,881 --> 00:42:27,911
out of this situation.
So that's all you gotta do what you 

1069
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:28,550
gotta do on.
He'll make his phone ring.

1070
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,320
Yeah,
he'll make his phone ring.

1071
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:34,321
And he's like,
I even saw once when this waitress at 

1072
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:34,321
the ice house,
pasadena at his house,

1073
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,410
this waitress was talking so much.
Finally he goes,

1074
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,450
please,
you're giving me an ear beating.

1075
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,950
Seriously,
I need to.

1076
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:45,150
I need to get out of here.
That was like joey diaz meets ernie and 

1077
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:46,190
bert.
No.

1078
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,340
Who is that oscar the grouch?
Cookie.

1079
00:42:49,341 --> 00:42:50,220
Monster cookie.
Monster.

1080
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:53,690
Monster ate cookie.
Okay.

1081
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:55,750
So anyway,
so joey told her that he's,

1082
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:58,070
he's getting it here,
but you're getting the ear beat and just

1083
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,270
start going.
Stop.

1084
00:42:59,300 --> 00:42:59,810
Yeah.

1085
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,570
She took me to say that some people you 
cannot,

1086
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,790
you cannot hit.
She did that last thing like,

1087
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,280
oh,
kind of like feeling being silenced like

1088
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,030
that.
Well sort of,

1089
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:16,031
but maybe she's fucking crazy.
Maybe that's the only way to get her 

1090
00:43:16,031 --> 00:43:16,031
away.
You know,

1091
00:43:16,031 --> 00:43:17,450
maybe she would've just sat down with us
and started talking to us.

1092
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,560
So some people just don't know.
Some people need those checks just 

1093
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,250
because there's always going to do it 
unless somebody does say something,

1094
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:28,130
be fucking bad ass.
If you could test drive people's brains,

1095
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:33,190
if you could be like,
I wonder how dumb this motherfucker 

1096
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,501
really is.
Can we just climb inside your head for 

1097
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:35,501
five minutes?
Be able to read it someday?

1098
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:35,501
Probably,
yeah.

1099
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:37,100
Malcovich dude.
Have you seen john malcovich lately?

1100
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,160
No.
Have you seen it ever being drawn on 

1101
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,160
liquid?
It's a great movie.

1102
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,650
It's a great move.

1103
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,570
Yeah,
just rewatch.

1104
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,220
imagine if you could pilot,
you know,

1105
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:50,221
if you could like,
I want to know what it feels like to be 

1106
00:43:50,221 --> 00:43:50,221
a girl.
So you pilot allison?

1107
00:43:50,221 --> 00:43:50,570
Yeah,
for like just pilot around the house for

1108
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:55,571
like an hour and shula and she just,
she just stay silent and lets you move 

1109
00:43:55,571 --> 00:43:57,290
around and look through her eyes.
She knows her in there.

1110
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:00,380
She left In there and you can move.
She goes silent.

1111
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:05,381
You walk around,
you move her body around you finger 

1112
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:05,450
yourself.
You can do whatever you want.

1113
00:44:05,451 --> 00:44:09,410
You have her body for one hour and then 
a trigger to get into sleep with a bunch

1114
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:11,870
of guys.
I don't think I would do that.

1115
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,330
Oh definitely.
Finger myself though for sure.

1116
00:44:14,331 --> 00:44:16,700
Wouldn't you?
I would do that stuff,

1117
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,110
I would pee on myself and all that crap.
You realize when you,

1118
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,420
when you start using a flashlight.
Yeah,

1119
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:25,850
sex is way better,
but it's pretty fucking good.

1120
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,280
And that's why girls like girls with 
dildos,

1121
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:31,200
like I never got that.
I was like,

1122
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,000
why don't you stick some

1123
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,590
remembered inside yet it's not as good 
as a real dick,

1124
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:36,480
but I bet it's probably pretty fucking 
close.

1125
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,490
You know,
girls.

1126
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,990
I would definitely,
if I would,

1127
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:45,010
I would 10 minutes I'd finger myself.
I would try to have sex with another 

1128
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,020
woman while it was that really tried to 
make out with her.

1129
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:46,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

1130
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,870
And what have you turned midnight and 
turn into a pumpkin.

1131
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:53,871
Like point.
It was like 1158,

1132
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:58,941
you know,
it'd be great right now if I was a guy 

1133
00:44:58,941 --> 00:44:58,941
and are a girl,
but I'm not attracted to guys ever since

1134
00:44:58,941 --> 00:44:59,880
my uncle touched me.
I'm really only attracted to.

1135
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,660
Oh shit,
I forgot to tell you I was going to turn

1136
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:06,140
into a dude.
We keep going,

1137
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:11,170
keep going.
That would be cool if you could keep 

1138
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:11,170
going because you'd already be horny.
And then she'd be fine,

1139
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:15,471
I creeped out because she just told You 
about her uncle and then also in a big 

1140
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:16,190
part decks in front of her.
I think if I saw that actually happen,

1141
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,050
I would probably freak the fuck out.

1142
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:26,450
Could you imagine just morphing like.
Because there are certain animals that 

1143
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:26,970
changed sex,
that's not unusual in nature.

1144
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:30,710
It happens in a bunch of situations.
Certain animals start off as a woman and

1145
00:45:30,711 --> 00:45:34,680
they become a male or vice a versa.
And they can change dependent on certain

1146
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:39,681
insects and certain worms and shit.
I think they can change dependent on 

1147
00:45:39,681 --> 00:45:41,430
whether or not there's enough males or 
females in the population.

1148
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,940
It's variable.
Yeah.

1149
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,810
There's a bunch of like simple organisms
that can do that.

1150
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:49,560
So if simple organisms could do that,
why can't I can't it fucking humans.

1151
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:54,710
That was this part of the movie splice.
You don't even know the movie splice.

1152
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,420
Who's amazing movie.
What's that guy's name?

1153
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:02,421
Adrian brody.
I could've bought that movie for a 

1154
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:05,040
brilliant scientist.
And what he did was he managed to splice

1155
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:07,170
together.
I don't know what it's like alien,

1156
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:09,690
what it was it like.

1157
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:15,510
And some other shit it was,
it was like a person and some other 

1158
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,380
shit,
like maybe a frog or something.

1159
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,880
They made like this little alien baby 
and this is how dumb the premises,

1160
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,230
they keep this alien baby app,
this laboratory and it grows into a full

1161
00:46:25,231 --> 00:46:30,231
grown human in like a couple of months 
and they just keep it in the basement 

1162
00:46:30,231 --> 00:46:31,350
and they just like hanging out with her 
in the basement.

1163
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,560
Now all of a sudden she's a chick and 
she's kinda hot except her eyes.

1164
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:36,390
You too far apart.
That's like the only thing that he could

1165
00:46:36,391 --> 00:46:38,850
tell.
So this thing is like maybe three months

1166
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:42,900
old and it's an attractive woman thing 
and he liked it gets scared,

1167
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:45,030
but if it wants to kill you,
okay.

1168
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:50,031
And then maybe three weeks after that he
starts fucking at adrian brody is 

1169
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:53,130
fucking this three month old alien baby 
thing.

1170
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,820
I swear I'll shut that thing off in the 
middle of my adrian brody story.

1171
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:03,220
Anything that is,
it's probably the fence toll free 

1172
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:03,320
callIng.

1173
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,750
well that's pretty weird.
So he starts fuckIng the thing that's 

1174
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:16,450
like,
this thing is only a couple of months 

1175
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:16,450
old.
I would have not waited that long.

1176
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:16,550
I would have fucked that thing.
The first,

1177
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:18,410
second day look like a girl and it was 
like,

1178
00:47:18,411 --> 00:47:19,550
oh,
I made you,

1179
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,060
wouldn't you?
You would do the same thing.

1180
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:23,540
No,
no,

1181
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:28,541
you wouldn't fuck this.
First of all because it didn't look 

1182
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:28,541
totally look like a person.
He had wings.

1183
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:28,760
Okay.
Crazy feat.

1184
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,600
It had like the,
like the,

1185
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,160
the back

1186
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,800
legs were like horse legs.
Did a talk in english.

1187
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,540
Uh,
you know,

1188
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:36,950
I made noises,
noises.

1189
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,700
It was way retarded.
And then at the end of the movie it 

1190
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,880
becomes a male.
Something happens,

1191
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,940
something happens.
It goes through some really not feeling 

1192
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:51,550
well and some weird thing it's going to 
die and it becomes a male.

1193
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:56,580
Adrian brody had sex with the male 
starts jacking and I think it kills 

1194
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:56,800
adrian brody at the end.
I don't remember.

1195
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:58,090
It was so bad.
I couldn't remember.

1196
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,630
It was such a dumb movie.
It was like it was over.

1197
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:03,430
You're like,
shut the fuck up.

1198
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,730
Know there's no spoilers in this.
But when you,

1199
00:48:05,731 --> 00:48:08,380
when the movie sucks tab and we're 
allowed to talk about it,

1200
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:09,410
you know,
it's like,

1201
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,590
it's fun.
It's fun to watch because it's bad.

1202
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,500
Like I was a giggle fest.
So she had boobs.

1203
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,840
Like did they have like some,
a little tits?

1204
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,900
Yeah.
I said that could have turned me the 

1205
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:21,900
right way.
Well,

1206
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:21,900
she's real aggressive too.
And big,

1207
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,430
like powerful and shows.
He was really kind of creepy.

1208
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,620
BuT she's supposed to.
She's supposed to be four fucking months

1209
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:27,790
old,
you know,

1210
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:29,800
or whatever.
AT the most six.

1211
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,360
She said they had to get out of the lab.
You know,

1212
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:37,410
she acts like a child.
She curls up and cuddles with them like 

1213
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:37,890
a child and get scared and cries.
But then like,

1214
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,420
eat a cat shit.
Did he just start fucking her?

1215
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:45,421
Like raping her?
Did he like her hair first started 

1216
00:48:45,421 --> 00:48:48,210
making onto him and next thing you know,
he's boehner and I swear to god the 

1217
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,560
whole theater is howling.
Howling,

1218
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:51,940
laughing.
Yeah.

1219
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,640
I mean I was,
I felt bad that I was laughing.

1220
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,290
I felt I can't laugh at this.
Fuck.

1221
00:48:56,291 --> 00:49:01,291
I'm going to be,
I'm going to be that dick and the movie 

1222
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:03,301
theater laughing,
but then other people started laughing 

1223
00:49:03,301 --> 00:49:03,301
too.

1224
00:49:03,301 --> 00:49:03,301
I was going,
oh no.

1225
00:49:03,301 --> 00:49:08,220
And then other people started laughing 
out loud and then it just became a wave 

1226
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,750
through the whole theater.
Everybody was just going no what?

1227
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,970
The people were just going,
what the fuck ever.

1228
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Elma fail.
And that's one of the cool things about 

1229
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,610
going to see a movie in hollywood.
Like a lot of times we go see a movie in

1230
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:19,360
hollywood.
Like,

1231
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:24,361
you know,
there's a lot of cool people in the 

1232
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:24,361
audience.
Sometimes some shit,

1233
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:24,790
stupid,
stupid shit will happen in the movie.

1234
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:27,040
And everyone agrees like everyone is 
like,

1235
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:30,870
what is this happened when I was 
watching the trailers to inception.

1236
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,770
Um,
and it was,

1237
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,130
what's that guy making?
He made that movie where everyone's in a

1238
00:49:36,131 --> 00:49:41,131
village and they don't know the devil's 
it showed like his name in the whole 

1239
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:44,440
same thing happened in my theory.
I've been talked about that before.

1240
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,100
I've seen it three times that the devil,
when it came on it,

1241
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,380
everyone just started going,
oh,

1242
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
this looks cool.
But that mother of that fucking 

1243
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,000
disappointing cock sucker,
he needs to change his name.

1244
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,880
No man.
I'm telling you.

1245
00:49:57,881 --> 00:50:00,130
The devil movie was pretty good.
I liked that movie.

1246
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:01,780
Yeah,
I took a chance.

1247
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,210
I'm desperate.
I'm desperate for good horror movie.

1248
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:09,500
But it seems like he's getting gotten to
a point where a lot of people probably 

1249
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,770
aren't going to watch that movie.
Did not direct this.

1250
00:50:11,771 --> 00:50:16,771
I don't think he just produced it bro.
Man,

1251
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,860
you might've cost yourself $50 million 
bite.

1252
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:23,980
I was doing tech support two months ago 
and as I was working from home I'd watch

1253
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:27,350
horror movies over and over again,
like just random ones on netflix.

1254
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:28,120
And I like watched probably

1255
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,060
like two a day to the point where like 
two weeks went by and I'm like I need to

1256
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:37,150
switch it up.
Like I've been watching this shit too 

1257
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:37,150
much.
I had like weird dreams and shit.

1258
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:40,120
Sometimes there's a problem with like 
the celebrity pr director,

1259
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,610
like the shama lawns boom.
You know,

1260
00:50:43,611 --> 00:50:48,611
like because there's a bunch of movies 
that are really good movies that don't 

1261
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:48,611
have that,
you know,

1262
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:49,300
that doesn't say,
you know,

1263
00:50:49,301 --> 00:50:51,810
james cameron's boom,
but there's when,

1264
00:50:51,811 --> 00:50:56,811
when with certain dudes like their name,
like m night shambhala dinged on is the 

1265
00:50:56,811 --> 00:51:00,601
number one.
His name is just immediately associated 

1266
00:51:00,601 --> 00:51:00,850
with all of his movies.
Did he fail at that?

1267
00:51:00,851 --> 00:51:04,690
Everybody hates him so much.
Also go one with the sixth sense was the

1268
00:51:04,691 --> 00:51:05,640
last good one.
Wider.

1269
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,590
Unbreakable was okay,
but it was really slow.

1270
00:51:08,591 --> 00:51:13,480
But then there was the water one was so 
dumb and the plant one and I didn't even

1271
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:18,481
see the plant one,
but everybody told me to plant one was 

1272
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:20,760
fucking god awful.
Did you see the plant one and now 

1273
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,100
happening?
I saw now a gang of them that made me 

1274
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:23,100
nuts.

1275
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:23,100
Yeah.
I saw.

1276
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,230
I forget which ones I can't remember,
but I still take chances.

1277
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,430
I'm a sheep big film.
What'd you?

1278
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,360
Friday night.
The big film with cozy it.

1279
00:51:31,361 --> 00:51:34,000
Fuck it.
I'll just sit there and try to watch it,

1280
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,920
man,
sit there with my popcorn and try not to

1281
00:51:35,921 --> 00:51:39,100
think this is stupid,
but that was a good movie that the devil

1282
00:51:39,101 --> 00:51:40,120
was not bad.
It was.

1283
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:42,550
It was tricky.
It was good enough.

1284
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,220
You know,
it was a,

1285
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:45,100
a good horror movie,
you know?

1286
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:48,100
I expected it to.
Soccer did not fucking not enough.

1287
00:51:48,101 --> 00:51:49,390
Good horror movies out tHere,
man.

1288
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,510
Couldn't monster movie.
I think the human centipede was the last

1289
00:51:52,511 --> 00:51:57,511
one I Watched.
Was it more just gore of I want to see 

1290
00:51:57,511 --> 00:51:58,140
monsters when somebody makes some good 
models.

1291
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,370
Do you see human centipede?
I got and I didn't want.

1292
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:05,550
I watch it for the creek festival.
I mean it's one of those movies I was 

1293
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:06,530
going to turn off after the first 20 
minutes.

1294
00:52:06,531 --> 00:52:11,531
I just wanted to get a taste of it,
but then I kind of got addicted to the 

1295
00:52:11,531 --> 00:52:12,050
fact that it was so creepy and I was 
just like,

1296
00:52:12,051 --> 00:52:14,330
I got to see what's happening here.
I mean,

1297
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,130
it's not good.
I don't like it,

1298
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:17,130
but it's,
it's,

1299
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,630
it's definitely worth seeing just 
because the characters in it are fucking

1300
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:22,730
creepy as fuck.
Have you seen that?

1301
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:24,320
Maybe shutter island?
Yes.

1302
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:29,350
Okay.
That one was not surprising and 

1303
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,691
whatever,
but there's a movie called madhouse and 

1304
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:31,691
it wasn't surprising because you kind of
knew it was going to Happen.

1305
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:31,700
It's like,
oh,

1306
00:52:31,701 --> 00:52:32,990
he's obviously going to be the crazy 
person.

1307
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,510
That movie was a hot subject of debate 
amongst me and my friends.

1308
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,370
Really?
Yeah.

1309
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,900
Most of us thought like I went to see 
you with sikora and with uh,

1310
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:44,290
eddie bravo and uh,
they both.

1311
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:49,350
We all thought that it Was a bad movie.
I felt like you can't just show me a 

1312
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,130
bunch of shit and then say,
oh,

1313
00:52:51,131 --> 00:52:53,170
psych.
He was crazy the whole time.

1314
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:54,190
It was all a dream.

1315
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,350
If you go on like a netflix look at 
madhouse just like shutter island,

1316
00:52:58,351 --> 00:53:01,650
but with like unknown actors,
really completely better story.

1317
00:53:01,651 --> 00:53:06,651
Better ending.
Like I wished that one made it to 

1318
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:06,651
theaters.

1319
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:06,651
yeah,
the shutter island,

1320
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:09,250
whenever it looked bad ass and it seemed
kind of interesting,

1321
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,530
but when you found out that he was 
crazy,

1322
00:53:11,531 --> 00:53:16,531
like halfway there was,
there was one point in time when you 

1323
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:16,531
kind of knew that things were a little 
wonky,

1324
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:21,511
like okay,
this is all of a sudden we've entered 

1325
00:53:21,511 --> 00:53:21,610
into this unrealistic micozzie climbing 
up these mountains,

1326
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,200
you know,
and by the ocean,

1327
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:25,210
remember that part by the ocean when 
climbed in the cave.

1328
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,540
Right.
And how can you start thinking,

1329
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:29,550
okay,
obviously it's crazy like it's going on,

1330
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:33,330
but you can't have a movie where you 
have everything makes sense and then all

1331
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:35,010
the sudden it doesn't.
And oh,

1332
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,290
it was a dream.
Like that's like a cheap trick,

1333
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,180
like a slap in the face to all the 
viewers.

1334
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:40,160
Yeah,
I mean I get,

1335
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,090
I get,
you're trying to be crafty.

1336
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:43,920
It just,
I don't think it's successful.

1337
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,480
I don't,
I didn't think it was good.

1338
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:50,790
I wonder how some of these get put out 
and pass all the people they need to 

1339
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,790
pass and then it gets such bad viewer 
responses.

1340
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:56,020
Well,
the big part about the whole movie 

1341
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:56,020
business is the producers.
The big part about the movie business is

1342
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,190
that people that come up with the money,
so it's not just,

1343
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,400
well,
it's a bunch of different people get 

1344
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:03,400
involved.

1345
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:03,400
They,
you know,

1346
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,910
it's not just the people who wrote it or
the people who were performing the 

1347
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,611
characters.
There's a lot of other shit behind the 

1348
00:54:09,611 --> 00:54:09,611
scenes,
you know,

1349
00:54:09,611 --> 00:54:12,240
and there's a lot of cooks and 
everybody's got their own idea of what 

1350
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,131
you should be in and should be not.
And I've seen a bunch Of things that 

1351
00:54:15,131 --> 00:54:15,350
were really good,
get fucked up a bunch of things.

1352
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:20,560
The man show and doug and I did it.
That got all fucked up by other people 

1353
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,530
involved looking at the screen,
worn it movie man.

1354
00:54:21,531 --> 00:54:23,620
Have you seen the premium that looks 
like somebody.

1355
00:54:23,621 --> 00:54:25,400
I was going to say that the best example
there was,

1356
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,290
um,
there was a movie that I did a long time

1357
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:28,880
ago.
It was a terrible movie.

1358
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:33,920
It was called frank mccluskey.
Cei or pii private investigator,

1359
00:54:33,921 --> 00:54:34,800
I think it was.
Anyway,

1360
00:54:34,801 --> 00:54:36,050
it was this kid,
I forget his name,

1361
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,370
dave,
who's the lead,

1362
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:39,580
who's a really funny guy,
and uh,

1363
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,570
he was doing all these different.

1364
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:46,570
I Should respect to him find out what 
the fuck his last name is at green horn 

1365
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:50,000
immediAte looks fucking now I'm 
wondering if it's supposed to be funny,

1366
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,110
but what I'm saying is with this guy,
when I did this,

1367
00:54:52,111 --> 00:54:56,600
this movie,
I'm dave sheridan,

1368
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,100
that's his name,
did this movie,

1369
00:54:58,101 --> 00:54:59,960
this fucking kid.
It's hilarious.

1370
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:02,000
And he would have in him and his friend 
wrote it,

1371
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,470
right?
So he had like,

1372
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:08,560
they were like going over the scenes and
what's the best way to make them funny 

1373
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,110
and,
and the dude was really good.

1374
00:55:09,111 --> 00:55:10,700
Like he's a really good actor.
He was in like,

1375
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,150
like I'm a scary movie and it's been in 
a bunch of different films.

1376
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,390
So anyway,
he's,

1377
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:18,110
he's performing the scene and it like 
he'll come in and,

1378
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,090
and hit it his way,
but there's all these.

1379
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,710
No one knows who this guy is,
right?

1380
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:26,800
So there's all these suits in the room 
and these guys would like fucking 

1381
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,070
expensive cufflinks and rolex watches 
and suspenders.

1382
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:32,600
And they're given this dude literally 
giving him takes like do it like this.

1383
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,800
Like when you walk in,
I want you to blow like this.

1384
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,650
I watched this guy do this and I'm like,
this is what happens.

1385
00:55:39,651 --> 00:55:44,651
When these motherfuckers get power,
they all of a sudden they think that 

1386
00:55:44,651 --> 00:55:44,651
their creative,
all of a sudden they want.

1387
00:55:44,651 --> 00:55:46,580
They want to influence the these,
these funny people making their shit.

1388
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:51,700
just because you've backed a bunch of 
movies and you've got a bunch of 

1389
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,821
successful movies under your belt,
doesn't mean you know how to make 

1390
00:55:54,821 --> 00:55:57,731
something funnier,
but they all just want to get their 

1391
00:55:57,731 --> 00:55:58,640
greasy fingerprints on it.
Like it's a big problem in hollywood.

1392
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:02,240
It's like no one lets like the smaller 
the group,

1393
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:03,800
the better.
That's what it's got to be.

1394
00:56:03,801 --> 00:56:05,000
The smaller the group,
the better.

1395
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,880
And you can't make what they're doing 
better.

1396
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:09,000
You can't go in and go,
no,

1397
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:11,240
no,
you guys are focusing too much on this.

1398
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:13,550
It's too much that you've got to bring 
it back and make it like you.

1399
00:56:13,551 --> 00:56:16,040
All you're going to do is cause chaos.
All you're going to do is interrupt.

1400
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,620
So either they make something that you 
enjoy or they don't,

1401
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:22,000
but you can't add to the process.
It's like saying if you were,

1402
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,460
if someone was building car,
they're making a porsche

1403
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:29,730
and you're like,
I don't like the way this front end 

1404
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:30,190
looks what I want the front end to be.
Stick up like this.

1405
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,140
It's like a cobra.
Like it's coming at you.

1406
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:32,830
And they'd go,
hey,

1407
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,010
that doesn't work.
Because there's aero dynamics.

1408
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:36,880
Like we need aerodynamics.
He scientifically,

1409
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:38,650
it doesn't work,
but I think it would really work.

1410
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:40,150
We got to figure out a way to make this 
work.

1411
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,020
And he'd be like,
well,

1412
00:56:41,021 --> 00:56:42,010
did this,
this is stupid.

1413
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:47,011
You're not a car designer.
What's the same thing with these 

1414
00:56:47,011 --> 00:56:47,011
assholes?
They're not,

1415
00:56:47,011 --> 00:56:47,470
they're not funny.
They're not actors,

1416
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:52,471
they're not comedians.
They're just fucking people with money 

1417
00:56:52,471 --> 00:56:52,760
that have financed a bunch of movies and
get it.

1418
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,280
Yeah.
So if you're doing a tv show,

1419
00:56:54,281 --> 00:56:56,140
if you're doing a movie,
there's a bunch of different people that

1420
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:57,250
have their say,
you know,

1421
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,260
that's how john travolta gets cast as 
john gotti.

1422
00:56:59,261 --> 00:57:02,050
There's a bunch you know and you know 
you're looking at a guy like that.

1423
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:02,500
You're like,
okay,

1424
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:04,090
so big name.
We'll get john travolta,

1425
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:05,080
john travolta,
regati.

1426
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,090
It's very controversial.
Maybe we should go with it.

1427
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,900
It's going to get a lot of press.
John travolta's gotti.

1428
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,800
Yeah.
Meanwhile,

1429
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,930
meanwhile,
back at the ranch,

1430
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,790
I guarantee you if we find the guy who 
wrote that thing,

1431
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,560
he's probably fucking pulling his hair 
out.

1432
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:22,620
John drove a whole dog freely.
The previous work of all time for john 

1433
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,540
gotti.
I was a fucking.

1434
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,260
I was undercover.
I wrote this book.

1435
00:57:29,261 --> 00:57:30,920
I wore a wire.
You pop socket.

1436
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:33,070
My life,
my family's life.

1437
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,930
I'm fucking john travolta.

1438
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:39,270
Don't they love him for Greece though?
Not anymore.

1439
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,110
No,
no.

1440
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,390
After this picture of the inquire of him
kissing another man.

1441
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:48,500
Really interesting you say I'm getting 
off as yet and there's a picture of him 

1442
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,370
kissing a bunch of people that know him 
that he said it online that have said in

1443
00:57:53,371 --> 00:57:56,550
interviews that thought it was like out.
I thought it was like,

1444
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:01,610
you know,
there was a big article and like think 

1445
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:01,610
it was vanity fair.
Some,

1446
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,010
some dude that drove walter used to 
bone,

1447
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,420
just talked about how,
you know,

1448
00:58:03,421 --> 00:58:06,930
he would just go to bath houses and shit
and just hook up.

1449
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:09,980
Remember the family guide with the last 
family guy,

1450
00:58:09,981 --> 00:58:13,700
I think it was where it shows the Greece
where they fly out into the air,

1451
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,800
like in the car and then it was like 
the,

1452
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:21,820
the,
the bonus thing that they cut out the 

1453
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:21,820
movie where they're just like,
oh my god,

1454
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:22,010
it's cold up here.
And that's cool up here,

1455
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:27,100
you know,
because they're just flying through the 

1456
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:27,100
sky and then she's like a warm me up,
you know,

1457
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:27,290
hold me,
warm me up.

1458
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:27,980
He goes,
hey,

1459
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:29,210
I'm good.
I'm good.

1460
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,650
A gay joke.
Did your volt down?

1461
00:58:31,651 --> 00:58:31,700
Yeah,

1462
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,630
that's funny.
You know,

1463
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:35,250
I,
I,

1464
00:58:35,251 --> 00:58:38,650
I understand that if he was gay and I'm 
not saying he is because I don't know,

1465
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,250
you know,
but if he was,

1466
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:44,950
I totally understand them not wanting to
tell people because of his business.

1467
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:50,370
You don't get to play the lead in movies
if they know you're gay because there's 

1468
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:50,750
just a big chunk of America like you 
know,

1469
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:54,610
fucking probably 30 or 40 percent.
This is just not going to go see a movie

1470
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,330
where john travolta is kissing girls and
it has a girlfriend or a wife.

1471
00:58:58,331 --> 00:58:59,740
If you know that he's,
he's gay,

1472
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:05,200
don't you usually get to a certain point
in money at least or where you don't 

1473
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:08,300
need to worry about not getting lead 
roles anymore.

1474
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,300
You could still probably make money,
you know,

1475
00:59:10,301 --> 00:59:15,301
if.
Especially if you're gay to commercials 

1476
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:15,301
or that's easier said than done.
Man.

1477
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:15,700
You know,
a

1478
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,980
lot of people don't want to disappoint 
their fans.

1479
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,740
A lot of people were worried.
One of the reasons why,

1480
00:59:20,741 --> 00:59:25,741
you know,
certain alleged organizations protect 

1481
00:59:25,741 --> 00:59:26,450
their members from homosexual,
you know,

1482
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:27,540
rumors and all,
all,

1483
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,270
you know,
anybody finding out that they're gay,

1484
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,580
it's because they're trying to protect 
them as a business.

1485
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:35,570
They're trying to use like a systematic 
approach as a business to maximize their

1486
00:59:35,571 --> 00:59:36,620
opportunity.
Look,

1487
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:38,750
if you can come out,
but if you do,

1488
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,400
here's what's gonna happen.
First of all,

1489
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:41,630
you're only going to come out to 
strangers.

1490
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:42,830
You're friends all know you're gay 
anyway,

1491
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,450
right?
That's all that matters.

1492
00:59:44,451 --> 00:59:49,451
Your friends and if you come out,
there's a bunch of roles you're not 

1493
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:52,421
going to get.
There's a bunch of things you're going 

1494
00:59:52,421 --> 00:59:54,121
to get pushed away for and you just 
might be a few opportunities that you 

1495
00:59:54,121 --> 00:59:54,121
miss and when it's all over what's write
a book,

1496
00:59:54,121 --> 00:59:55,550
but write a book will say you get,
but for now,

1497
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,140
let's say you're name.

1498
00:59:56,170 --> 01:00:01,170
Okay.
And we'll throw in a couple of quirks 

1499
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:01,170
are or perks.
Likely.

1500
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:01,660
Yeah.
You can be that the woman in hairspray.

1501
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:04,180
Sure.
Every girl.

1502
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:05,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

1503
01:00:05,891 --> 01:00:07,300
It's kinda funny.
You know,

1504
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:09,070
it's a fucking interesting thing man,
though,

1505
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:12,040
the way the human sexual system is 
wired,

1506
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:17,070
there is this ad that are maybe like a 
preview on the news and it's like oprah 

1507
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:18,910
tells a big secret like next week at 
four and I'm like,

1508
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:21,780
isn't it always kind of questioned?
But she's a white man,

1509
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,030
white man.
No one ever saw that coming.

1510
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,590
Oprah.
Yeah.

1511
01:00:26,591 --> 01:00:27,700
What is,
what was the secret?

1512
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,650
I don't know.
I don't think it aired yet.

1513
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:32,760
Her Big secret is that she's going to be
a lesbian.

1514
01:00:32,761 --> 01:00:33,670
And with that girl,
right?

1515
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,690
People think that already.
A lot of people think that I uh,

1516
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,800
why?
What did you just bring up oprah?

1517
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:43,700
Like I was watching over it on the news,
like bring chicks to the shoeburg.

1518
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,300
Start bringing.
When do I watch oprah?

1519
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:49,350
I watch it occasionally and just so just
see.

1520
01:00:49,351 --> 01:00:54,351
It's like,
I just need to know that that site 

1521
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:54,351
existed.
He sits,

1522
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:54,351
scribed a day.
Oprah channel,

1523
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:54,351
joe.
Uh,

1524
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:54,990
no I haven't.
You have to pay for it.

1525
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:57,660
I'll watch it would,
you know,

1526
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:00,900
I mean I will every now and then just to
see what the fuck is up.

1527
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,160
I watch everything,
man.

1528
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:04,830
I watched hunting shows.
I watch super,

1529
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:07,980
super right wing political shows.
I watch.

1530
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:13,040
I watch people like a scientist,
like I just want to know what the fuck 

1531
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:13,040
is out there.
You know,

1532
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,730
I don't watch a lot.
A lot of shit.

1533
01:01:14,731 --> 01:01:16,500
I don't watch for entertainment.
I watched,

1534
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,100
I just watched to see what is this,
you know,

1535
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,330
a go,
you know,

1536
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,670
so many shows man,
like religious shows.

1537
01:01:23,671 --> 01:01:28,671
I love watching religious shows.
Do they watch steve harvey on this 

1538
01:01:28,671 --> 01:01:28,671
religious?

1539
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,550
It was fucking awesome.

1540
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:33,040
First of all,
he's crying about the pressures of being

1541
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:34,720
famous.
It was amazing.

1542
01:01:34,721 --> 01:01:36,490
You know it was piece of cats,
don't know.

1543
01:01:36,491 --> 01:01:41,491
Cats don't know what it's like,
like complaining about being this 

1544
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:43,990
multi-multi millionaire celebrity and 
then he started talking about god and it

1545
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:46,750
was just brilliant.
It was just amazing stuff.

1546
01:01:46,751 --> 01:01:48,370
He was saying.
He was like,

1547
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:49,900
what did he say?
It goes,

1548
01:01:49,901 --> 01:01:52,360
if you can't,
don't have god in his life,

1549
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,000
I don't even want to talk to you.
You're silly.

1550
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:59,800
Silly person was awesome.
Like if you don't believe in god,

1551
01:01:59,801 --> 01:02:02,110
you're a silly person.
Friend do that to me.

1552
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:03,670
She told me,
allison,

1553
01:02:03,671 --> 01:02:05,830
we can't be friends anymore because 
you're not a woman of god.

1554
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,120
And I'm like,
bitch,

1555
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:12,121
I was fucking just started kissing her.
is that what I should have checked her 

1556
01:02:12,431 --> 01:02:13,170
oil?
Say,

1557
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,660
shut up bitch.
You want to taste your pussy?

1558
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:19,720
Stuck my fingers in your pussy.
Things like bad

1559
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:22,710
girl,
bad girl.

1560
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:26,250
She just would've went right with it.
Their dirty little bitch.

1561
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:27,420
Yeah.
So what?

1562
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:28,620
What did,
how was the conclusion?

1563
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,060
Did you guys break up?
No more friendly.

1564
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:31,740
We're besties.

1565
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:32,990
Yeah.
I know.

1566
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:38,080
We kind of met up I guess a year ago,
but this happened like when you were 15 

1567
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:38,080
and I was like,
are you crazy?

1568
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:40,550
Yeah.
So french righteous little cunt.

1569
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,420
Yeah,
it was weird.

1570
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,680
That's ridiculous.
You don't know what the fuck is up and 

1571
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:46,680
you're 15.
You did go to catholic school.

1572
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,620
I went to catholic school for like four 
years.

1573
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:49,790
Yeah.

1574
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:55,240
it was rough.
So much guilt and strain and stress and 

1575
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,601
so many people that come from guilt and 
strain and stress have their kids in 

1576
01:02:58,601 --> 01:03:02,501
there.
So there's fucking straining in the 

1577
01:03:02,501 --> 01:03:02,501
home.
Wow.

1578
01:03:02,501 --> 01:03:02,501
Fucking want.
I will just repression.

1579
01:03:02,501 --> 01:03:04,370
And so one of the most depressing 
religions.

1580
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,000
Yeah.
I didn't like it at all.

1581
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:08,580
better.
Used to go to confession for like once a

1582
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:09,510
week and I'm like,
I'm not doing this.

1583
01:03:09,511 --> 01:03:12,150
And I got kicked out in ninth grade.
I went to public school.

1584
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:14,640
Sounds like religion.
They would have gotten me if I was like,

1585
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:19,700
what?
The mormons or something like that or 

1586
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:19,700
someone fun.
So it looks like they have a good time.

1587
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,460
I have friends that are mormons.
When they go to church,

1588
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,950
it's like basically you sit around with 
a bunch of people's families,

1589
01:03:22,951 --> 01:03:24,870
you say some nice things about god and 
you'll leave.

1590
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:29,100
Nobody feels like shit.
Nobody feels like a fucking center.

1591
01:03:29,101 --> 01:03:29,910
Like a piece of shit.

1592
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:34,990
I talked to two mormons and be like a 
couple months ago while they were 

1593
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:35,750
walking around and I was on a jog,
we started talking and I said,

1594
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:40,780
oh,
you guys don't ever have a time to 

1595
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:40,780
relax,
go see a movie or whatever.

1596
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:40,780
And they're like,
no,

1597
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,510
we can only rest for seven hours on 
wednesday.

1598
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:46,570
And that's what we do our laundry.
but the rest of the time we're scouting 

1599
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:46,570
around and knocking on people's doors.

1600
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:47,150
Oh the,
okay.

1601
01:03:47,151 --> 01:03:49,870
You're talking about missionaries.
People are on a mission.

1602
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,020
This isn't like,
you know,

1603
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:52,910
everybody has an app to do that.
No,

1604
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,360
these are just the people that want to 
like go and recruit people.

1605
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,300
Bicycle.
And then I think they called them elders

1606
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:01,040
or something like that.
Elder john.

1607
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:02,000
I'm like,
what's your name?

1608
01:04:02,001 --> 01:04:05,190
fucking hilarious.
As a young dude coming up to you,

1609
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:08,600
colin,
self elder the fuck out of here.

1610
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:09,500
Pretty hard.
This,

1611
01:04:09,501 --> 01:04:14,501
uh,
this person that I know that is a 

1612
01:04:14,501 --> 01:04:14,501
mormon,
I'm just recently,

1613
01:04:14,501 --> 01:04:16,580
they've completely abandoned it,
so it's been kind of fascinating.

1614
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:21,910
So they had some things happen to them 
in their life and they just decided the 

1615
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:21,910
religion really doesn't make sense 
anymore.

1616
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:23,630
It's kind of weird.
So weird wHen that happens,

1617
01:04:23,631 --> 01:04:25,040
man,
when all of a sudden someone just goes,

1618
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:27,050
oh,
what was I doing?

1619
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:29,450
Like I knew people that used to be 
christians,

1620
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:33,770
like we're super super christian and 
then they just kinda lightened up on it.

1621
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:38,770
But you know,
like rampage jackson at one point in 

1622
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:38,770
time,
wouldn't swear,

1623
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:40,080
wouldn't stop swearing,
didn't want to have premarital sex.

1624
01:04:40,081 --> 01:04:45,081
So we got married,
like the whole deal went super full 

1625
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:45,081
blown christian.
So that was just the gIrl making them do

1626
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:45,440
that.
Probably.

1627
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:46,940
I don't know.
I don't know man.

1628
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,100
I think at some point in time people get
real,

1629
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,580
real nervous and they really want to 
believe that there's an answer.

1630
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,050
You know?
They really want to believe that someone

1631
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,350
who's got a book from 3000 years ago 
with all the shit in it,

1632
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:58,160
it's all in here,
man.

1633
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:03,340
It's all in here.
You can live a perfect life and if 

1634
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:03,340
you're around people that really,
truly believe in,

1635
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:03,340
here's the deal,
man.

1636
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:08,141
It fucking works.
If you were around someone who's a real 

1637
01:05:08,141 --> 01:05:08,141
true,
practicing christian,

1638
01:05:08,141 --> 01:05:10,010
I mean,
think about what that is for a real,

1639
01:05:10,011 --> 01:05:11,870
true practicing,
practicing christian.

1640
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:15,680
You are just doing christian things.
You're trying to be loving and love your

1641
01:05:15,681 --> 01:05:17,710
neighbor and do charitable for your 
community.

1642
01:05:17,711 --> 01:05:22,711
I mean,
that's really what it's supposed to be 

1643
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:24,031
all about and if you do that,
that really will make you a happier 

1644
01:05:24,031 --> 01:05:24,640
person.
So it does work,

1645
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,280
you know,
even though it's,

1646
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:31,350
you know,
it's the reason why it works is because 

1647
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:33,721
you're tricking yourself into believing 
that this 2000 year old book written by 

1648
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,050
people thought the world was flat in the
son was 17 miles away,

1649
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:37,330
has all the fucking answers.
That's ridiculous.

1650
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:38,570
But,
but the,

1651
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:40,360
the fact that if you believe in 
something like that,

1652
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:42,160
it's like a placebo effect for your 
life.

1653
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,640
Yeah,
I was actually at work and one of my 

1654
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,621
bosses,
he's a pastor also and he hands me that 

1655
01:05:49,621 --> 01:05:49,621
rick warren's book and he's like,
what is that?

1656
01:05:49,621 --> 01:05:51,430
It's like rick warren,
like the chosen path.

1657
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:54,430
It's a catholic or a christian book that
a pastor wrote.

1658
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:58,810
It's like one of the best selling books 
ever really told the um,

1659
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,240
the crazy ones are with the,
is it,

1660
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,520
is it two guys?
They have like some whole fucking,

1661
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:06,580
a whole series of like super,
super,

1662
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:09,100
super popular books,
but it's all about like the apocalypse.

1663
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:12,100
You don't know about this?
Yeah,

1664
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:17,130
there's,
I think there's a group of two guys and 

1665
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:18,490
they're like the best selling authors in
America and people don't even know about

1666
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:19,060
them.
God,

1667
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:21,820
I got to find this out right now.
I hate when this happens with these.

1668
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,000
Did you read the religious book?
No,

1669
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:27,940
he handed it to me and I was like,
what's this far?

1670
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,890
And he's just like,
I want you to read this.

1671
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:35,460
And I'm like,
well I don't want to read this so you 

1672
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:35,460
could have it back.

1673
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:35,460
And he's like,
why don't you want to read it?

1674
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,660
It's just like a briefing on the bible 
and whatnot,

1675
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,340
and I just told him,
even though he's a pastor,

1676
01:06:39,341 --> 01:06:42,130
like I don't want to read this.
Let's say I'm at work right now.

1677
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,910
I don't need to read this.
Here's the guys.

1678
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:49,450
There's two guys named tim lahaye and 
Jerry Jenkins and they write.

1679
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:54,451
This book's called the left behind 
series and were these lives and made 

1680
01:06:54,451 --> 01:06:58,561
them into movies and I have two of them 
have both of them because they're 

1681
01:06:58,561 --> 01:06:59,830
fucking awesome.
And there were kirk cameron and it's all

1682
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:02,320
about how jesus comes back and everybody
dies,

1683
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:06,060
but the christians get taken to heaven 
and everybody here is fucked.

1684
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:08,320
Do they get left behind?
It's like fictional.

1685
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:10,720
Oh yeah.
They believe it is the apocalypse.

1686
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:15,721
This is the real shit.
God's going to come back and if you're 

1687
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:17,821
not saved,
that's why these not banks like kirk 

1688
01:07:17,821 --> 01:07:17,821
kirk cameron.

1689
01:07:17,821 --> 01:07:17,821
That's what you see him talking to gang 
bangers and,

1690
01:07:17,821 --> 01:07:19,110
and you know,
trying to get them to,

1691
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:19,630
you know,
to,

1692
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:20,040
to,
to,

1693
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:25,170
to come to god.
Like he really believes that jesus is 

1694
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:28,171
going to just show up and everybody's 
going to be taken to heaven and 

1695
01:07:28,171 --> 01:07:30,991
everybody else is going to be stuck and 
fucked and left back behind here on 

1696
01:07:30,991 --> 01:07:34,201
earth in a godless world with no laws 
and all the good christian to be gone 

1697
01:07:34,201 --> 01:07:36,060
and there'll be stuck here.
He really believes that and it's.

1698
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,760
These books are fucking huge,
huge,

1699
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:42,970
huge sellers like millions and millions 
of copies.

1700
01:07:42,971 --> 01:07:45,070
Some of the most successful books in 
America.

1701
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:48,710
Some of the most successful fiction or 
crazy shit lately.

1702
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,380
Full of shit.
And he's just dolla.

1703
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:53,410
Dolla bills.
well I don't think so man.

1704
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:55,810
I think they started out probably you 
can.

1705
01:07:55,820 --> 01:08:00,820
I don't know man.
You think they're full of shit 

1706
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:00,820
completely.
Who knows man.

1707
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,140
I mean look at like all these people 
that ever get in trouble for like,

1708
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:03,820
you know,
I think he's gay.

1709
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,920
If religious guys,
if I had a bet money on kirk cameron 

1710
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,570
being gay or not gay dude,
he had a perm when he goes on.

1711
01:08:10,571 --> 01:08:12,610
Growing parents.
Yeah.

1712
01:08:12,611 --> 01:08:14,200
But that doesn't mean anything.
So did.

1713
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:15,890
I'm trying to think of somebody good.

1714
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,650
I think tommy morrison and made a perm 
at one point in time,

1715
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,120
he has aids

1716
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:26,150
bad example,
but um,

1717
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,570
when I see him like trying to convert 
people and i'M like,

1718
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,490
what are you running froM doing?
Why Are you so into this?

1719
01:08:31,491 --> 01:08:36,491
What's,
what's that about why or why is that 

1720
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:36,491
consuming your,
your humanism?

1721
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:40,530
It's a,
it's a gay thing or my kid's game game 

1722
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:40,530
money and money and thanks.
So

1723
01:08:40,530 --> 01:08:45,430
I don't know.
To me it just seems like it's a smart 

1724
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:45,920
thing that he's doing the same reason 
why there's clean comics.

1725
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:47,490
You had seen that,
but this guy

1726
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:51,060
goes into,
has like debates against like scientists

1727
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:53,430
and they look really stupid.
Him and his buddy,

1728
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:58,460
he's got a buddy that has a,
I forget this fucking buddies is 

1729
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:01,791
buddies.
Retard ray comfort and never seen the 

1730
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:01,791
banana thing,
right?

1731
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:04,230
Where it says of the banana was designed
by god and this is how we can prove it.

1732
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:07,770
He shows the banana fIts in your hand.
Then he peels the banana and eats it and

1733
01:09:07,771 --> 01:09:08,760
shows.
This is the,

1734
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:09,790
this is a,
um,

1735
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:15,340
an evolutionist nightmare because this 
is like clear evidence of creation that 

1736
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:19,641
god has created this fruit.
Like you fucking really meant that when 

1737
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:19,641
he was saying it,

1738
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:22,240
guy created a dick.
It also fits in the hand.

1739
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:26,440
It also gives you juice when you were 
thirsty after killing dinosaurs.

1740
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,340
But no,
no,

1741
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:30,010
the,
he has to do that kind of shit though.

1742
01:09:30,011 --> 01:09:31,890
In order for him to make this money.
He didn't,

1743
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:36,340
to be legit to several of these books,
he has to also do bullshit like that,

1744
01:09:36,341 --> 01:09:36,940
you know,
you would be,

1745
01:09:36,941 --> 01:09:41,941
have to be a way better actor than he's 
capable of because these two guys were 

1746
01:09:41,941 --> 01:09:41,941
so dominant,
these debates and they're,

1747
01:09:41,941 --> 01:09:46,621
they're so fascinating.
There's no way you could not believe 

1748
01:09:46,621 --> 01:09:46,621
what they're saying and say the things 
they're saying,

1749
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,640
unless it's like one big gigantic,
you know,

1750
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:51,820
multi-decade hustle.
I don't think so.

1751
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:53,800
I think they're just knuckleheads,
you know,

1752
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:58,830
I think there's knuckleheads and they 
get married to an idea and then they 

1753
01:09:58,830 --> 01:09:59,710
just stick with that motherfucker.
Whether it makes sense or not.

1754
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,690
but these dudes,
these left behind dudes.

1755
01:10:01,691 --> 01:10:03,970
I want to know what,
what their circulation is.

1756
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:04,770
Mm,

1757
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,520
sure you do,
baby.

1758
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:07,990
That's their circuit asian.

1759
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:12,240
Um,
shit.

1760
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:15,900
By the way,
oprah disclosed that,

1761
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,650
that at her news was that she has a half
sister.

1762
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:21,500
She didn't know about what?
That's news.

1763
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,730
How ridiculous is that?
How is that news?

1764
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:29,070
Right.
Everything was oprah's news.

1765
01:10:29,071 --> 01:10:34,071
I mean,
it's kind of like when you get put in 

1766
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:36,381
that certain class of why is that news 
will black lady and what is it that 

1767
01:10:37,431 --> 01:10:38,150
doesn't make any sense.

1768
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:44,800
I can't find out how many books just 
think sold not quickly,

1769
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:49,630
but it was a fuckload officially a fuck 
load of books.

1770
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:52,330
That's all about these people being left
behind.

1771
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:55,370
It's fucking awesome.
If you ever want to get blazed and watch

1772
01:10:55,371 --> 01:10:57,380
kirk cameron rocks,
it's really

1773
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:01,900
rather growing pain.
that would be good to at least stay like

1774
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:03,590
tracy golds in there and you know,
get.

1775
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:05,040
Ooh,
let's get some tracy gold.

1776
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,630
I've been paying attention to what's 
going on in yellowstone.

1777
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:09,990
Yellowstone national park,
you know,

1778
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:14,190
has a called dara super volcano that 
erupts every six to 800,000

1779
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:19,191
years and just fucking continent killer.
It kills almost everything on the 

1780
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:22,200
content killed like two thirds of all 
living things on,

1781
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:24,030
on north America.
Well,

1782
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:24,750
uh,
the,

1783
01:11:24,751 --> 01:11:29,751
uh,
magma has been bulging and it's got 

1784
01:11:29,751 --> 01:11:33,771
these bulging pocket swells where the 
earth is lifting and there's all these 

1785
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:39,080
forms,
these photos of them online and the 

1786
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:39,080
questions starting to freak out.
When are we,

1787
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,350
they don't know.
We'll see.

1788
01:11:40,351 --> 01:11:42,150
It's been about 600,000
years.

1789
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,680
So it could,
it really could happen.

1790
01:11:43,681 --> 01:11:45,300
They're not,
they were concerned.

1791
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,010
They said they were concerned for 
awhile,

1792
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:52,160
but then they're not now they're not 
anymore because it stopped doing what 

1793
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:56,061
they were worried it could do.
But the bottom line is it's completely 

1794
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:56,450
unpredictable.
They don't know what,

1795
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:01,460
when,
when it can happen or why it happens or 

1796
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:01,560
what causes it when they say it's a 
contract killer,

1797
01:12:01,561 --> 01:12:03,240
like I could destroy the whole 
continent.

1798
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:06,420
Is that like maximum?
And the minimum is like,

1799
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:11,450
oh,
it will ruin like the taco bell next 

1800
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:11,450
door,
you know?

1801
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:11,450
Well this is what it is,
dude.

1802
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:15,830
It's 300 kilometers wide and it's a 
super volcano,

1803
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,730
which means when it blows up,
you know,

1804
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:20,430
uh,
mount saint helens is a volcano and then

1805
01:12:20,431 --> 01:12:25,431
at the top there was a small area where 
all the water was shooting up in the 

1806
01:12:25,431 --> 01:12:28,491
air.
Well this isn't like that with this is 

1807
01:12:28,491 --> 01:12:31,250
like the top part,
but the top part is a 160 miles wide and

1808
01:12:32,251 --> 01:12:36,650
it shoots straight up in the air like a 
fucking mile high wall of love,

1809
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,040
agitate.
And then steve.

1810
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:43,070
Yeah.
And then nuclear winter occurs because 

1811
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:44,100
the entire surface of the earth gets 
covered in fucking ash.

1812
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:49,250
Like no planes can fly.
Remember that little tiny baby as 

1813
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,190
volcanic blew up in Iceland and 
everybody got fucked.

1814
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,220
Nobody can even fly anywhere.
But when this one blows,

1815
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:57,750
it's they do anything.
Like take the drill holes in it.

1816
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:00,240
No,
no,

1817
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:01,440
no.
This is way too big.

1818
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:02,840
You got to move to Australia,
bitch,

1819
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:05,690
move to Australia and have some canned 
food waiting.

1820
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,550
Seriously.
If that motherfucker goes,

1821
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:11,190
if that mother fucker goes,
it's going to go.

1822
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:13,470
You probably won't be able to do 
anything.

1823
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:14,850
You probably won't be able to get out in
time.

1824
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,490
If we find out tomorrow that yellowstone
is going to blow.

1825
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:19,740
What are we gonna do?
Where are we going to go to san diego?

1826
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:23,300
That's why I keep that in my car job,
my my emergency kit at all.

1827
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:27,700
I hope that thing has a motor boat and 
you're going to have to get the fuck put

1828
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:32,890
in there.
That's a good idea to get one of those 

1829
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:32,890
rafts blowup raffing.
Sure.

1830
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:33,800
Because you know in Australia when it 
was fucking when,

1831
01:13:33,801 --> 01:13:36,900
when these crazy floods hit,
there were sharks in the street.

1832
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,450
Sharks.
people spotted sharks.

1833
01:13:39,451 --> 01:13:41,880
Bull sharks swimming down the street.
That's how much water.

1834
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:46,881
There wasn't Australia bringing guns.
New molten lava was just coming and 

1835
01:13:47,221 --> 01:13:49,630
there is no escape.
You kill yourself.

1836
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,140
It's not even that.
It's not.

1837
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:52,890
The molten lava was goIng to fuck you.
Yeah,

1838
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:54,570
that's bad.
Lab is terrible,

1839
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:58,050
but when it's all the other stuff that's
going to get you to the toxic rain,

1840
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,830
the fucking shit and the air wick,
it fills your lungs up and kills you.

1841
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:06,970
Like a lot of animals,
like they found all these woolly 

1842
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:09,150
mammoths and they were all dead and um,
they were dead in like this mask,

1843
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:14,210
like field of them.
And one of the things they found was 

1844
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:14,250
that their lungs were all filled with 
like sit.

1845
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,500
Her lungs were filled with like volcanic
ash.

1846
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:22,650
And so what happened was they just got 
caught in some big volcano eruption and 

1847
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:24,460
then just breathe in all that smoke and 
it literally turned their,

1848
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,010
their,
their,

1849
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:28,660
their lungs into rocks and they just 
die.

1850
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:31,420
You know,
you gotta lungs filled with volcanic ash

1851
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:33,210
and it's like volcanic rocks,
you know,

1852
01:14:33,211 --> 01:14:34,870
basically in your body.
It's terrible.

1853
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:35,650
It's terrible.
Yeah.

1854
01:14:35,651 --> 01:14:37,300
It cuts off your air.
You can't breathe.

1855
01:14:37,301 --> 01:14:39,700
You're all.
You mean the air is thick with this shit

1856
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:45,060
and they all died.
Have you ever thought you'd get one of 

1857
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:45,060
those chemical max that you can get?
Like at surplus stores?

1858
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,450
You know,
like when you need that chemical mask,

1859
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:48,270
everybody's dead anyway,
you know,

1860
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:49,930
if you needed that mean,
what are you going to do?

1861
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:50,500
You're gonna,
you're gonna.

1862
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:51,630
Be mad max.
You're gonna.

1863
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:55,240
Be out there on your own.
Go walk around and humps him dead ladies

1864
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:57,400
and grabbed some wallets.
I dunno,

1865
01:14:57,470 --> 01:15:02,470
a certain point in time.
You got to say nighty night a heaven or 

1866
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:03,820
hell,
and I did kill myself in that situation.

1867
01:15:03,821 --> 01:15:05,050
I hope that they'd be like,
it's okay.

1868
01:15:05,051 --> 01:15:05,560
We get it.

1869
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:07,540
No.
See they don't get it.

1870
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:08,800
There's no exception.
That king

1871
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:13,880
kill yourself.
Kill yourself before you suffocate to 

1872
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:13,880
death or molten lava that attacks your 
body.

1873
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,890
Like molten lava probably gives you a 
really quick.

1874
01:15:17,891 --> 01:15:21,120
I mean if you fell in a bit,
have you felt on a volcano?

1875
01:15:21,121 --> 01:15:22,960
We'd take like one second.
You would just disappear.

1876
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:26,100
Volcanoes and that's called.
How long could you last?

1877
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,410
That's what they used to do,
man.

1878
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:29,190
In Hawaii,
people are douche bags.

1879
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:32,340
They throw him in fucking palae they 
throw in a volcano man,

1880
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:34,160
until he got rid of cons.
Yeah,

1881
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:34,950
he's.
Yeah.

1882
01:15:34,951 --> 01:15:38,730
That's how they get rid of people.
That's how they execute them back in the

1883
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:42,600
day sun back when motherfuckers wearing 
skirts.

1884
01:15:42,601 --> 01:15:43,890
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?

1885
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,920
Throwing spears at animals and shit 
sacrificed wild wild pigs and shit.

1886
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,730
That'd be a wild place to live,
throwing people in a volcano.

1887
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,880
There was a documentary on the lost 
tribes and all these different people 

1888
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:02,850
that are still living in elected live 
thousands of years ago,

1889
01:16:02,851 --> 01:16:04,650
all over the world.
And uh,

1890
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,420
I was watching it and I was thinking to 
myself,

1891
01:16:06,421 --> 01:16:11,421
man,
what the fuck would I do if it all went 

1892
01:16:11,421 --> 01:16:11,421
back to this?
How would I,

1893
01:16:11,421 --> 01:16:15,740
would I even want to go back to this?
Like what if society ended and all of a 

1894
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:20,241
sudden you're making bows and arrows out
of bamboo trees and making your own 

1895
01:16:20,241 --> 01:16:24,831
twine.
You're trying to feed your family by 

1896
01:16:24,831 --> 01:16:24,831
hunting food.
Fuck man.

1897
01:16:24,831 --> 01:16:25,760
Really?
What,

1898
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:31,100
why,
why would you think that would be kind 

1899
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:31,100
of like,

1900
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,340
be like camping.
And he'd be like fun for like a week and

1901
01:16:32,341 --> 01:16:33,730
then you're like,
I'm fucking hungry.

1902
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:38,760
There's nothing to eat around here 
except this bird that won't sit still 

1903
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:38,810
and I need to make a,
I

1904
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,600
guess what,
there's not that many animals.

1905
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,990
It's not nearly as many as you would 
need to sustain a population.

1906
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:44,650
Okay.
You know,

1907
01:16:44,651 --> 01:16:45,810
we think of,
you know,

1908
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:46,840
we'll go hunting.
Well,

1909
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,030
you know,
there's no animals to hunt anymore.

1910
01:16:49,031 --> 01:16:54,031
It's not like it used to be 300 years 
ago where you could go anywhere near 

1911
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:55,720
here and it'd be deer everywhere and all
sorts of other animals to eat.

1912
01:16:55,721 --> 01:16:58,390
Like we pushed all those bitches out.
There's nothing left.

1913
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:03,750
You know,
occasionally you'll see a deer in 

1914
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:03,750
hollywood,
you know,

1915
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:03,750
like,
um,

1916
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:04,910
you ever drive up laurel canyon and see 
a dear family and shit.

1917
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:05,860
It's a trip,
you know,

1918
01:17:05,861 --> 01:17:06,790
it's like,
wow,

1919
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:07,960
you guys are still here.
Huh?

1920
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,460
Me that yesterday.
If you ever see it around here,

1921
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:15,860
it seems very empty and we'd be fucked.
We'd have to start eating each other 

1922
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:17,650
probably.
No,

1923
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,490
definitely dogs first.

1924
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,560
Then people.
There's no other food.

1925
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,690
How many fucking cows are they around 
here?

1926
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:26,870
If you've got no more cars.
Okay.

1927
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:28,580
Cars don't work anymore.
Let's just get crazy.

1928
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,530
Right?
What are you going to do?

1929
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,240
You got no phones will start eating 
people,

1930
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,280
right?
Yeah.

1931
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,860
And then you're going to probably kill 
yourself.

1932
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:41,940
You gotta try to figure out a way to 
kill yourself after you've eaten a few 

1933
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:41,940
people and you feel bad.
Yeah,

1934
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:42,140
definitely.
Yeah.

1935
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:45,650
I couldn't person.
Would you rather die?

1936
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:46,910
Uh,
yeah.

1937
01:17:46,911 --> 01:17:48,410
I would kill myself before I hear a 
person.

1938
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,130
Speaking of killing yourself,
this fucking bath salts thing.

1939
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,440
Have you heard about this?
Yeah.

1940
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:59,710
I have this craziness.
This is for the folks that haven't 

1941
01:17:59,710 --> 01:17:59,710
heard,
and this is not a joke.

1942
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:00,140
This isn't the onion.
Okay.

1943
01:18:00,141 --> 01:18:05,141
This is the huffington post,
which is sometimes almost as funny as 

1944
01:18:05,141 --> 01:18:05,141
the onion,
but in a different way.

1945
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:10,180
Anyway,
this is what they're saying is that 

1946
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:13,631
there's chemicals that are sold as bath 
salts and people are taking these and 

1947
01:18:13,631 --> 01:18:18,170
again high with them and it's making 
people like crazy suicidal,

1948
01:18:18,171 --> 01:18:23,171
do a nutty shit.
Like there's one guy took a skinning 

1949
01:18:23,171 --> 01:18:25,661
knife,
it says slit his face and stomach 

1950
01:18:25,661 --> 01:18:25,661
repeatedly.
He survived,

1951
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:30,730
but other people haven't been lucky as 
was snorting or injecting and snorting 

1952
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:34,880
powder such as innocuous sounding names 
as ivory wave read,

1953
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:39,881
dove and vanilla sky.
So it basically turns you into some 

1954
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,170
fucking homicidal suicidal maniac.
That's crazy.

1955
01:18:42,171 --> 01:18:44,300
Who was the first person who did that?
Fuck.

1956
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:44,990
Yeah,
I mean,

1957
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
what?
What is it about people that were so 

1958
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,200
desperate to change our state of 
consciousness,

1959
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:56,380
so desperate to get drunk or high or 
speak in which you're fucking drunk.

1960
01:18:56,391 --> 01:18:57,560
CasT.
Okay.

1961
01:18:57,561 --> 01:19:02,561
I've been meaning to do this 
intervention and do it on the air 

1962
01:19:02,561 --> 01:19:03,350
because this is an intervention.

1963
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,540
I need to talk to the both of you.
Okay.

1964
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:07,880
You can't drink like that that often?
No,

1965
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:10,700
we don't do that.
You're gonna die and you're going to die

1966
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:15,760
on camera.
You're going to have fucking liver 

1967
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:15,760
failure on camera and that's going to be
a sad show.

1968
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,990
We waited like 10 days between the both.
You fine me.

1969
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,730
His motherfucking calls me up.
You got research.

1970
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,890
I got you sick,
dude.

1971
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,870
I saw you fucking shit.
Faced slurring.

1972
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:27,740
Hammered on the ustream.
Bato jaeger bottle.

1973
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,440
Jaeger master.
you're blaming me for you being sick.

1974
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,020
Shut the fuck up,
man.

1975
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:34,400
Yeah,
you pulled should be sick.

1976
01:19:34,401 --> 01:19:36,050
You crazy.
Fuck nuts.

1977
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:38,510
Still sick.
So what they do is for the folks at home

1978
01:19:38,511 --> 01:19:43,511
to do not know about this,
they do this thing called the drunk 

1979
01:19:43,511 --> 01:19:46,121
cast.
He calls it blackout cast or drunk cast 

1980
01:19:46,121 --> 01:19:46,121
and he's done it a few times and they do
it.

1981
01:19:46,121 --> 01:19:46,730
Sometimes they do it and they watched 
the ufc,

1982
01:19:46,731 --> 01:19:51,731
which is pretty cool.
they'll watch the fights and then like 

1983
01:19:51,731 --> 01:19:52,310
while the fights are going on,
all these comics are commentating on it.

1984
01:19:52,311 --> 01:19:53,400
It's really funny,
you know,

1985
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:57,490
like joey's over there and sam trIpoli 
and tb and um,

1986
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:02,740
well the latest thing is they drank a 
whole fucking bottle of jaeger and just 

1987
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:05,040
get completely.
It's like an hour or tWo.

1988
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,640
It was not,
it was not like the promise.

1989
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:08,010
We've done

1990
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:13,010
two of that blackout cast,
which is where we take a whole bottle 

1991
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,640
and we start going crazy.
First one was the jaeger might've jaeger

1992
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:18,990
meister bottle and we did that in like 
an hour and then don't remember the last

1993
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:21,450
half of it to remember the next day for 
the first couple of hours,

1994
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:23,730
you know,
I don't remember anything.

1995
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,730
Then the second one we didn't feel like 
when you watch the video,

1996
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:30,770
that one was funny because it was.
Yeah.

1997
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:32,760
But the last one was so bad.
You took it down.

1998
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:33,540
I.
Well,

1999
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:35,460
I'm debating on it because the problem 
was,

2000
01:20:35,461 --> 01:20:40,240
is the ufc drunk casts was right before 
it and we got sloshed on the drunk cast,

2001
01:20:40,241 --> 01:20:42,550
like we wasted at the end of the,
the,

2002
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:43,500
the,
the last one.

2003
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:44,610
Uh,
and then,

2004
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,920
uh,
we decided like an hour later,

2005
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,840
hey,
we're still drinking,

2006
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:53,140
let's do a black outcast.
But then we were so wasted that we,

2007
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:58,340
we couldn't even think of what to drink.
So we're drinking coconut water with 

2008
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:01,971
vodka.
We were doing just like straightened 

2009
01:21:01,971 --> 01:21:02,100
morgan's good.
It was actually good.

2010
01:21:02,101 --> 01:21:04,980
It was pretty good.
Did you do it over the rocks,

2011
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:05,880
huh?
Yeah,

2012
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,660
it was good.
It takes a,

2013
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:10,420
took off the edge of the vodkas that 
tastes like or take a walk.

2014
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:16,090
But we had like,
we had jaeger vodka beer and captain 

2015
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:16,090
morgan.
Right.

2016
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:18,280
And were drinking all those mixes two 
days in a row.

2017
01:21:18,281 --> 01:21:22,390
So two days in a row.
You're basically drinking cast is when?

2018
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:27,420
No,
that was an hour before we started this 

2019
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:27,420
blog post.
The same day.

2020
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:27,700
It was an hour hour podcasts in the same
day.

2021
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:30,160
Oh,
I thought it was the day before.

2022
01:21:30,161 --> 01:21:31,450
Oh my god,
that's ridiculous.

2023
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:34,090
No poor fuck it was.
I don't think you should post it because

2024
01:21:34,091 --> 01:21:35,700
we just got so on social.
It was a.

2025
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,110
It was like this.
This is an impersonation of most of the.

2026
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:44,160
Of the law.
That blog out one good.

2027
01:21:45,311 --> 01:21:46,420
Leave it.
Leave it up.

2028
01:21:46,421 --> 01:21:48,490
Dude.
That's important man.

2029
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,490
That's part of the entertainment.
That's.

2030
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:52,180
Listen,
that's part of the entertainment value.

2031
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:53,650
We don't.
People have to watch it.

2032
01:21:53,651 --> 01:21:55,810
you're not forcing them.
You're not charging them for it.

2033
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:57,550
It's up there.
Leave it up there and maybe I'll put the

2034
01:21:57,551 --> 01:21:58,660
audio,
but the video,

2035
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:00,140
the videos.

2036
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:02,710
How bout this?
How bout we record?

2037
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:05,650
We take the video and record you guys 
doing commentary.

2038
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:12,010
That would be funny and we have it 
playing on and then get it to a certain 

2039
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,510
point where it's like,
were you just not even talking anymore?

2040
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:17,890
And then just start explaining things 
and what was going through my head.

2041
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:24,510
Should I puke now or should I?
Can I hold it in or can I get to the 

2042
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:24,730
bathroom?
Keeping on camera.

2043
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:25,330
Yeah.
I tried.

2044
01:22:25,331 --> 01:22:30,331
There was a part where I get a bag in a 
bag and then she ended up puking you and

2045
01:22:30,491 --> 01:22:33,370
you ended up licking his fleshlight you 
should've thrown out.

2046
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:35,210
That was at the ufc drunk.
He did that.

2047
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,360
That was how drunk she was at the usc 
drunk has.

2048
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:41,230
I mean,
we really were like bad.

2049
01:22:41,231 --> 01:22:42,790
That last one.
I don't know if I can.

2050
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:48,030
I think the secret is starting off 
completely sober and then drinking a 

2051
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:51,961
whole bottle in an hour or something.
Did the porn stars touch your 

2052
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:51,961
flashlight?
No,

2053
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:51,961
they wouldn't.
They were like,

2054
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:54,250
I'm not going to touch that.
That's hilarious.

2055
01:22:54,251 --> 01:22:59,251
It girls pickets shit out of her teeth 
with her fingernails and she said the 

2056
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:05,240
flashlight and then allison kissed it.
She didn't clean.

2057
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:08,360
It was clean,
right?

2058
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,930
I listened.
It's washed,

2059
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:12,550
but the bottom line is,
well,

2060
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:14,800
it's like shaking hands with a dude.

2061
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:19,850
If you shake hands with the dude,
you're basically touching his dick 

2062
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:22,011
because every guy touched his dick and 
the odds of him having washed his hands 

2063
01:23:22,011 --> 01:23:23,310
after he touched his dick before he 
touches your hands,

2064
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,220
they're like 70 percent against most of 
the times.

2065
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,600
You know,
when you're not around,

2066
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:30,960
we were always grabbing our dicks and 
moving it around or grabbing our balls.

2067
01:23:30,961 --> 01:23:33,510
Like you shake your hand,
you're touching his balls.

2068
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:35,860
There's one point in the drunk cat.
So which,

2069
01:23:35,861 --> 01:23:36,190
this,
this,

2070
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,140
this,
this,

2071
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:38,180
this,
this is true.

2072
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:39,720
We kiss a girl.
You're sucking someone's deck.

2073
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:42,090
I don't think I ever told you this.
This is a true story,

2074
01:23:42,091 --> 01:23:43,380
a crazy story.
Uh,

2075
01:23:43,381 --> 01:23:48,381
so I used to work at this mexican 
restaurant and I was a waiter and the 

2076
01:23:48,381 --> 01:23:49,110
waitresses were,
there was 1:18

2077
01:23:49,111 --> 01:23:51,960
year old waitress,
like three slash 17 year old waitresses.

2078
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:55,290
They're all fucking hot and they all had
a crush on me.

2079
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:58,320
It's important of music.
And so anyways,

2080
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:03,480
uh,
I started having sex with the 18 year 

2081
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,781
old hostess player back in the day.
She had a party once.

2082
01:24:06,001 --> 01:24:07,720
Where did she invited all the hostesses 
and was.

2083
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:08,790
So it was me,
her,

2084
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:12,060
and like three other hostesses were all 
getting wasted drinking.

2085
01:24:12,061 --> 01:24:14,190
I bought them alcohol because that's 
what I like to do.

2086
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:16,370
But anyways,
uh,

2087
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,360
the party starters here,
I was like,

2088
01:24:18,361 --> 01:24:21,660
how can I make out with all these,
take advantage of all these girls at the

2089
01:24:21,661 --> 01:24:22,320
same time?

2090
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:27,650
And so I thought up this idea where I 
took saran wrap and I would put it in 

2091
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:29,250
between my mouth and the girl's mouth 
go,

2092
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:34,310
if you want to make out,
you're not touching me so we can pretty 

2093
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:35,520
much make out as much as you want and 
we'll feel real.

2094
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:36,450
They were like,
holy shit,

2095
01:24:36,451 --> 01:24:41,451
that's awesome.
And so I would just start making out 

2096
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:43,930
old.
Were you when I was 18 and they were 18 

2097
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:44,710
and they fell for this 13 year old.
No,

2098
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:45,290
no,
no,

2099
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:46,890
no.
It was great.

2100
01:24:46,891 --> 01:24:51,891
It's like I would on a couple of the 
girls that had a little hole in the 

2101
01:24:51,891 --> 01:24:53,100
thing that I find my tongue and they 
wouldn't have noticed because it felt it

2102
01:24:53,101 --> 01:24:55,650
feels real.
And then I started taking saran wrap and

2103
01:24:55,651 --> 01:25:00,651
putting on my hands.
But like I can touch your boobs because 

2104
01:25:00,651 --> 01:25:00,660
I'm not actually touching a serial 
killer.

2105
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:03,960
And this is a,
this is a good move.

2106
01:25:03,961 --> 01:25:05,260
Yeah.
And so I did that.

2107
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:09,420
We were so drunk I started getting mad.
So tell me more about this move.

2108
01:25:09,421 --> 01:25:11,070
So the girls let you do that?
Yeah.

2109
01:25:11,071 --> 01:25:12,960
Oh yeah.
All of them.

2110
01:25:12,961 --> 01:25:17,961
No,
it was up the shirt making out and this 

2111
01:25:17,961 --> 01:25:18,660
shirt and they were drawn to it.
You just have.

2112
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:23,670
And what was so funny is,
is that the girls could feel,

2113
01:25:23,671 --> 01:25:25,500
when I put my hand up with the plastic 
on,

2114
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:30,690
like it was like not like half,
like the saran wrap wasn't covering my 

2115
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:31,170
hand half the time to do that and it was
just like,

2116
01:25:31,171 --> 01:25:33,000
dude,
this move is awesome.

2117
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,760
Wild julian.
Julian assange is in jail for rape for 

2118
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:38,760
way less than that.
Right.

2119
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,400
And so then then the one girl I was 
fucking with,

2120
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:44,460
like I went and had sex with her and 
whatever that later that night,

2121
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:49,750
and they all,
the other girls like passed out in the 

2122
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:51,591
living room.
I came out and this one girl was like 

2123
01:25:51,591 --> 01:25:51,591
still awake,
horny.

2124
01:25:51,591 --> 01:25:54,531
And she called me over.
He started making out and we had sex in 

2125
01:25:54,531 --> 01:25:55,410
there and then it led to sex even.
So.

2126
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:00,520
So you think you started a competition 
by filling up all these girls and being 

2127
01:26:01,131 --> 01:26:02,320
the only male,
right?

2128
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:03,860
You,
you started a competition,

2129
01:26:03,861 --> 01:26:04,110
right?

2130
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,160
You created an unfair game.
It was a very smart move.

2131
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:09,830
It was very similar to.
The pound was strong.

2132
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:14,831
So I,
I pulled them out on allison and feel 

2133
01:26:14,831 --> 01:26:14,831
real.
It feels real,

2134
01:26:14,831 --> 01:26:15,560
right?
Like it felt completely real.

2135
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:19,880
Pulled them little young kids out there.
He's like,

2136
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:20,870
I'll use saran wrap.
I'm like,

2137
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:23,450
okay,
so why don't you use condoms?

2138
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:28,600
You don't even really fucking.
That's what you're pretty much doing 

2139
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,660
face condoms and condoms.
Wow.

2140
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:30,650
Pitch that.
The trojan.

2141
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:32,840
Yeah.
If you had a really strong plastic,

2142
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:37,930
like really strong one and you could put
your whole body and cover your entire 

2143
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:38,940
body in this sheet of plastic.
Sure.

2144
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:39,800
Let's try it out.
Look,

2145
01:26:39,801 --> 01:26:42,580
I can show you how real it feels.
Do you want to make out scene on,

2146
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:46,190
on today's show?
How dare you on today's big thing.

2147
01:26:46,191 --> 01:26:51,191
That website said earlier,
they had this thing where it's called 

2148
01:26:51,191 --> 01:26:54,191
the creepiest man alive and he blows 
himself up in balloons and he sits in 

2149
01:26:54,191 --> 01:26:54,191
there and hangs out.

2150
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:00,890
I wouldn't say he's the creepiest man 
alive if you need to get online.

2151
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:03,870
Right.
It's titled the title.

2152
01:27:03,871 --> 01:27:05,960
They're just being silly or it's not 
really the creepy.

2153
01:27:05,961 --> 01:27:08,330
That would be hilarious if I lived in a 
balloon,

2154
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:11,610
invited girls into my balloon.
The best thing ever,

2155
01:27:11,611 --> 01:27:13,610
and it's what's called today's big 
thing,

2156
01:27:13,611 --> 01:27:16,430
not today's big thing.
Dot com can never fucking keep track.

2157
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:18,040
All these sites are now.
That's a good one.

2158
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:22,760
Very good one.
Today's big thing.com.

2159
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:28,120
There's just.
when is the internet ever going to run 

2160
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:28,120
out a website?
Addresses?

2161
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,270
I don't know because that just start 
adding more dots.

2162
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,080
Dots,
dots.

2163
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:32,330
It's always weird when you're like,
dot,

2164
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:34,260
are you?
Hey,

2165
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:37,150
his fucking.
We tried to.

2166
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:39,210
We tried to give me a virus.
Jack.

2167
01:27:39,211 --> 01:27:40,860
MY jack,
my shit.

2168
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,600
If I look at it like a russian website,
I go,

2169
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:44,010
ooh,
red Romania.

2170
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:48,480
I was reading this thing and I'm a.
I believe it was in wired about this one

2171
01:27:48,481 --> 01:27:53,481
area of Romania that has like a,
just a gigantic percentage of the 

2172
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:57,681
world's hackers and they're all driving 
around like mercedes benz's and they're 

2173
01:27:57,681 --> 01:27:57,681
all like,
you know,

2174
01:27:57,681 --> 01:28:00,030
like young,
loud mouth kids that just hackers,

2175
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:05,100
just jacking people all these scams,
like how many times a week do you get,

2176
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,510
you know,
dear sirs,

2177
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:11,570
I need help from you and in exchange you
will have access to my grandfather's 

2178
01:28:12,091 --> 01:28:12,990
fortunate of,
you know,

2179
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:15,180
whatever the fuck it is and this is what
I need you to do.

2180
01:28:15,210 --> 01:28:15,770
How many of those.
Again,

2181
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:21,120
I got one today that was so hilarious.
That was from microsoft xbox award show 

2182
01:28:24,131 --> 01:28:27,070
soccer at g mail or something like that.
And it says,

2183
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:32,310
oh my goodness,
you have won the grand prize for the 

2184
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:34,750
microsoft word national holiday,
something like that.

2185
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,890
Sponsored by soccer.
You have another.

2186
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:39,040
Can you pull it out?
Let me see if I can pull it up.

2187
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:39,480
I,
I,

2188
01:28:39,670 --> 01:28:40,090
I,
I,

2189
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:43,000
oh,
those are the best in the nation.

2190
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,190
They're from Nigeria.
I wonder if I can get that.

2191
01:28:45,191 --> 01:28:46,490
I don't give a fuck.
And Nigeria,

2192
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,240
winter of microsoft,
Nigeria is the wild,

2193
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:50,380
wild west,
wild,

2194
01:28:50,381 --> 01:28:52,930
wild west.
But I loved how they were throwing in so

2195
01:28:52,931 --> 01:28:56,020
many key words that even if my mom saw 
it,

2196
01:28:56,021 --> 01:28:56,710
she probably be like,
well,

2197
01:28:56,711 --> 01:28:59,040
it is from microsoft word,
you know?

2198
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:00,000
Uh,
hold on right.

2199
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:00,550
Here we go.

2200
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:06,540
[inaudible] shit.
Did I delete that?

2201
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:08,300
So it came in as spam?
No,

2202
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:10,840
it came into my inbox,
but I think I marked it as spam,

2203
01:29:10,841 --> 01:29:13,050
so I don't know what happens to that.
Check your trash.

2204
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:14,700
I did check it.
It's not there.

2205
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,250
[inaudible].
I don't have it anymore.

2206
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:21,720
Oh brian.
But I literally just put it on.

2207
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:22,530
Oh,
here it is.

2208
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:22,980
No,
I got it.

2209
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:23,820
Great.

2210
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:26,890
I got a wHole section.
I saved my email.

2211
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,580
The wording on this right here it goes.
It's from microsoft.

2212
01:29:30,581 --> 01:29:35,581
Two thousand 11 g mail at f,
fifa World cup lottery.com.

2213
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,660

And it says,

million thousand payable in cash 

2223
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:28,260
credited to file number bet.
Something from total prize money of $50 

2224
01:30:29,021 --> 01:30:32,170
million united state dollars,
whatever.

2225
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:34,200
What are they asking for?
It says protect.

2226
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:39,400
Our participants were selected from 
g-mail worldwide websites throughout our

2227
01:30:39,401 --> 01:30:43,090
microsoft computer ballot system,
drawing from 21,000

2228
01:30:43,091 --> 01:30:44,590
names,
blah,

2229
01:30:44,591 --> 01:30:45,280
blah blah.

2230
01:30:45,490 --> 01:30:46,570
So what do they need you doing?

2231
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:52,060
So then it says there's some phone 
numbers and it gives some emails,

2232
01:30:52,061 --> 01:30:54,160
which would be great if we could call 
this person right now.

2233
01:30:57,020 --> 01:31:02,020
It says it must be claimed.
I have to fill out this thing in order 

2234
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:02,020
to avoid mistakes.

2235
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:02,020
Yeah.
Well,

2236
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:02,400
okay.
What do you have to do?

2237
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:03,900
What do you do?
You need to give them money?

2238
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:05,180
No,
it says the name,

2239
01:31:05,181 --> 01:31:06,210
address,
nationality,

2240
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:06,980
sex,
age,

2241
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,740
occupation.
Um,

2242
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:13,960
no.
It looks like I just have to call this 

2243
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:13,960
person back and that's when they start 
asking for numbers.

2244
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:13,960
Yeah.
And they probably,

2245
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,300
when they get all that information,
like name and all that jazz,

2246
01:31:16,301 --> 01:31:21,301
they probably zoom in on you than they 
do an internet search for you and then 

2247
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:22,380
they just start targeting you and going 
after you.

2248
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:24,230
I liked this asis,
lottery sponsors,

2249
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:26,270
sponsors,
microsoft corporations,

2250
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:31,450
and then it's just photos of all these 
pictures of people winning state 

2251
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:33,220
lotteries area.
It's ridiculous.

2252
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,100
I got,
I get a bunch of different kinds.

2253
01:31:36,101 --> 01:31:38,160
Some of them that are like,
they're like,

2254
01:31:38,210 --> 01:31:39,400
you know,
it's a different kind of scan.

2255
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:42,370
Like this one I got the other day.
uh,

2256
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:44,920
I don't know who the fuck this guy is.
So is ryan keegan?

2257
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:46,930
I have no idea.
I don't know any ryan keegan's.

2258
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,220
Hey,
how you doing?

2259
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:52,300
I made a trip to london two days back.
God mugged at gunpoint last night.

2260
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:54,820
All cash credit card and phone was 
stolen.

2261
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:57,850
I got messed up in another country.
I'm stranded in london.

2262
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,040
It was a bitter and I was

2263
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,130
hurting my right hand,
but I think I'd be just fine.

2264
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:07,510
I'm sending you this message because I 
don't want anyone to panic.

2265
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:09,790
I want you to keep it that way.
For now,

2266
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,000
my return flight leaves in a few hours,
but I'm having trouble sorting out my 

2267
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,570
hotel bills,
wondering if you loan me some dollars to

2268
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:21,571
sort out the hotel bills and also take a
cab to the airport about $2,500.

2269
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:25,120
I've been to the embassy but they aren't
helping issues have.

2270
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:27,070
I have limited means of getting out of 
here,

2271
01:32:27,071 --> 01:32:31,810
so I really need your help,
but I guess he sends this to like,

2272
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:36,870
you know,
I guess you send this to like a million 

2273
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:37,600
people and you get a few bites and all 
you need is a few bites.

2274
01:32:37,601 --> 01:32:42,601
If you could do this with a computer,
if a computer can generate a whole 

2275
01:32:42,601 --> 01:32:45,331
gigantic email list that you can steal 
from something or buy like a lot of 

2276
01:32:45,331 --> 01:32:45,340
them,
I bet you can buy them.

2277
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:50,640
You know what I mean?
There's a bunch of different 

2278
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:50,640
corporations for sure that they've gone 
on a business and you.

2279
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:55,071
You ordered something online and they 
sell your email address and they have a 

2280
01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:55,071
database.
They sell their database,

2281
01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:56,700
it doesn't matter.
It just amazes me that they're so.

2282
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:59,940
They're also stupid sounding like,
like at least go,

2283
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:00,390
hey,
well,

2284
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:05,420
let's talk about.
We talked about earlier the waitress 

2285
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:07,791
that wouldn't shut the fuck up.
The joey diaz had to give him a beating 

2286
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:10,031
too to tell her,
you give me an ear beating or if you 

2287
01:33:10,031 --> 01:33:10,380
took that woman and all of a sudden she 
gets this email,

2288
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,820
right?
I don't.

2289
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:15,000
Who are you?
Where do we know each other?

2290
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:16,500
They should add something like,
hey,

2291
01:33:16,770 --> 01:33:18,750
have you seen black swan yet?
That was awesome.

2292
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:23,130
Like they can make was stuck in london,
man talking about box.

2293
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:24,720
Microsoft word.
Me too.

2294
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:25,740
Anyways,
I need money.

2295
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:29,460
He gets one old retired woman who has 
alzheimer's and just like,

2296
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,630
oh my gosh,
where I am.

2297
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:36,800
Those people out there,
there's a lot of little little like 

2298
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,880
manboys out there too.
There's a lot of people that are like 

2299
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:38,880
children.
you could take their money.

2300
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:38,900
That's,
oh my god.

2301
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:43,960
I talked to this photographer and he has
a friend that does this organization 

2302
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:47,411
called project child safe where they get
a bunch of money together and this guy 

2303
01:33:47,411 --> 01:33:49,040
flies out to other countries and takes 
back like kidnapped kids,

2304
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:50,780
like the movie taken and brings them 
back here.

2305
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:56,380
Yeah,
I guess like the government has nothing 

2306
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:58,091
to do with it.
It's all like privately run and the do 

2307
01:33:58,091 --> 01:33:58,091
nothing right now.
Wow.

2308
01:33:58,091 --> 01:33:58,640
That is a lot of gunfire.
I would imagine.

2309
01:33:59,390 --> 01:34:03,590
Like a stolen kid for my family are 
pretty much kidnapping,

2310
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,690
but they go to other countries.
Right.

2311
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:06,650
That's scary.
Shit.

2312
01:34:06,651 --> 01:34:07,610
That's.
That's a good.

2313
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:10,300
That's a good reality.
Show project child safe.

2314
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:12,770
No shit,
but I bet you couldn't fault it would be

2315
01:34:12,771 --> 01:34:15,810
a little conspicuous running around with
a gun in their hand,

2316
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:19,160
sneaking around the corner with fucking 
camera guy and like a boom.

2317
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:22,520
Here's another one that I got that was a
much more subtle one.

2318
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:24,620
Attention.
How are you doing?

2319
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:25,550
Hope?
Fine.

2320
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:28,550
Question mark.
Sorry for the late email update.

2321
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:33,730
I want to make fast contact with Mr.

2322
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:34,550

Why do you save them?

2324
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,260
I save them all.
I just save them all.

2325
01:34:41,261 --> 01:34:44,830
I got one from the first bank of Nigeria
from 2009 that I saved.

2326
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:47,620
It's a collector's item.
Listen to this unread.

2327

Listened to the first line.

2340
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:33,470
it's awesome.
It's so bad.

2341
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,530
It's like,
do you have microsoft word?

2342
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:38,330
Motherfucker?
What did you run this shit through?

2343
01:35:38,331 --> 01:35:41,060
Google translate paint brush and text 
edit.

2344
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:43,310
They must've just raN it through a 
translation program,

2345
01:35:43,311 --> 01:35:48,311
right?
They don't know what the fuck they're 

2346
01:35:48,311 --> 01:35:48,311
saying.
That's what it is.

2347
01:35:48,311 --> 01:35:49,200
It's been translated like they do it 
millions and millions and millions.

2348
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:54,280
There's a part of me that is absolutely 
fascinated by this because what I'm 

2349
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:54,280
getting here,
right,

2350
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:58,960
okay.
I'm sitting in front of my computer and 

2351
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,611
I'm getting this direct connection with 
some fucking guides who are basically 

2352
01:36:00,771 --> 01:36:03,610
like gollum from the lord of the rings.
you know what I mean?

2353
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:08,620
Like think of like some of the people in
Nigeria see the somali pirates and all 

2354
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:09,130
these fucking nuts.
They got me.

2355
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:14,220
It's A wild,
crazy savage world there and they're 

2356
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:16,671
just millions and millions of email just
trying to fuck people out of their 

2357
01:36:16,671 --> 01:36:16,671
money.
How are you getting any.

2358
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:22,060
That's what these guys are doing.
Episode of intervention on annie and 

2359
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:24,941
I'm.
One of the guys was getting 

2360
01:36:24,941 --> 01:36:26,231
interventioned because he was addicted 
to replying to those kinds of spam 

2361
01:36:26,231 --> 01:36:27,620
emails.
He blew his whole retirement and he'd be

2362
01:36:27,621 --> 01:36:28,850
on the phone with africa and they'd be 
like,

2363
01:36:28,851 --> 01:36:29,900
we need 30 more dollars.
He's like,

2364
01:36:29,901 --> 01:36:30,740
okay,
I'm right on it.

2365
01:36:30,741 --> 01:36:32,030
And he's like,
I'm not getting scammed.

2366
01:36:32,031 --> 01:36:33,840
I'm just waiting for my prize money.
And his family is like,

2367
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:36,530
he does this intervention intervention.
Yeah.

2368
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:39,060
That,
that they shouldn't even waste a show on

2369
01:36:39,061 --> 01:36:40,400
that guy.
They should just slap them,

2370
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:44,540
you know,
they stopped them a couple times wasting

2371
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:45,960
a show.
It's fascinating.

2372
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:46,700
You know,
we,

2373
01:36:46,701 --> 01:36:51,701
we talked about tHis one guy that was 
getting scammed by these are nigerian 

2374
01:36:51,701 --> 01:36:54,540
dudes and they pretended that they were 
hot check and it was a famous porno star

2375
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:57,600
and they used her photos and this poor 
fucking guys,

2376
01:36:57,660 --> 01:37:02,660
you know,
like the sad old 60 year old man and he 

2377
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:04,911
thought that it was real.
I thought that he was really going to 

2378
01:37:04,911 --> 01:37:04,911
meet this is his queen.
What happening?

2379
01:37:05,010 --> 01:37:10,010
This dummy flew to london 14 times,
14 times for whatever reason they could 

2380
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:14,721
never quite hook up.
There's a good website called for 19 

2381
01:37:14,721 --> 01:37:16,290
eater.com
and they pretty much just screw over all

2382
01:37:16,291 --> 01:37:21,291
the scammers.
THat's really a whole website for 19 

2383
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:23,340
eater.com
is like a yelp for scammers.

2384
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:25,920
It's,
it's like opposite trolling baiting.

2385
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:30,980
Right.
Stan was stan hope used to do that all 

2386
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:32,691
the time.
Standing up piece to bait child 

2387
01:37:32,691 --> 01:37:32,691
molesters.
I think you read a book about it.

2388
01:37:32,691 --> 01:37:36,530
Did he?
Didn't he publish all of them as a book 

2389
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:36,670
or something?
It seems like it to do it for a job or I

2390
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:38,340
only did it for,
to be doug.

2391
01:37:38,341 --> 01:37:41,190
Stan hope that's just how stan ho brock 
said he was,

2392
01:37:41,191 --> 01:37:43,080
um,
contacting these,

2393
01:37:43,081 --> 01:37:48,081
uh,
these child molesters and then it take 

2394
01:37:48,081 --> 01:37:48,081
all the,
like,

2395
01:37:48,081 --> 01:37:48,081
all the fucked up shit that do we say to
them,

2396
01:37:48,081 --> 01:37:52,550
you know,
pretending he was like a little kid and 

2397
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:52,550
they would,
uh,

2398
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:52,980
put it online.
There was a whole website,

2399
01:37:53,010 --> 01:37:54,270
[inaudible] dot org.
Remember that?

2400
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:55,140
Yeah.
It's still around.

2401
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:56,220
I don't

2402
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,290
think so,
but that for 19 is awesome.

2403
01:37:58,291 --> 01:37:59,930
You gotta check that out.
There's like the,

2404
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:02,790
the hall of fame,
the trophy room where,

2405
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:03,960
you know,
in these

2406
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:07,690
people debating dot orgs here because 
it.

2407
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:08,440
Yep.
This is,

2408
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:13,450
we'll welcome to [inaudible] dot org.
One of the most fucked up sites on the 

2409
01:38:13,450 --> 01:38:14,260
internet due to the massive amount of 
sexual content on this site.

2410
01:38:14,261 --> 01:38:19,261
We felt it was in everybody's best 
interest to give you the phone 

2411
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:20,350
disclaimer and then you go in and it's 
all.

2412
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:23,320
It's the whole thing is all them baiting
child molesters.

2413
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:27,370
It's the fucking standup stuff though,
if you could find it.

2414
01:38:27,371 --> 01:38:28,300
Yeah.
There's a bunch of them.

2415
01:38:28,301 --> 01:38:32,080
You could see him nearby stan hope and 
their god damn genius.

2416
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:37,710
you know,
I think half of my lung is filled with 

2417
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:40,620
incense.
You got some crazy insect that was like 

2418
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:43,240
incident log,
fire log of innocent.

2419
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:46,540
That's the real shit man.
I get the front of the jamaicans outside

2420
01:38:46,541 --> 01:38:50,440
of the house of blues.
Is it too much?

2421
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:55,800
It's almost like I feel like I don't 
have any air breathing and 100 percent 

2422
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:57,790
I'll kill it.
Don't be a pussy.

2423
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:01,760
Meanwhile you smoke cigarettes.
I know my eyes are watering though.

2424
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:05,760
We're all like [inaudible].
Do you feel it?

2425
01:39:05,761 --> 01:39:09,100
Like it feels like it's just thick now 
that you're saying and I'm noticing it,

2426
01:39:09,101 --> 01:39:11,220
but I wasn't noticing it before.
Oh,

2427
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:14,900
you know what I'm trying to do,
man.

2428
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:20,560
I'll try to recreate what it used to be 
like back in the day when I started out 

2429
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,460
in the comedy because I was mad and he 
could just go into a smoky room when you

2430
01:39:22,461 --> 01:39:24,700
knew that just dark shit was gonna 
happen

2431
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,750
about those smoky rooms,
man,

2432
01:39:27,751 --> 01:39:29,760
where you just,
you just knew.

2433
01:39:29,790 --> 01:39:31,260
No one's taking care of.
They're healthier,

2434
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:31,670
right?
This is,

2435
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:33,420
this is a place of deviance.
That's,

2436
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:38,720
you know,
that's why I used to love smokey pool 

2437
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:38,720
halls.
Pool balls used to be the best.

2438
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:38,850
He'd go In to clock in the morning,

2439
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:41,970
packed in a thick cloud of cigarette 
smoke.

2440
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,410
yeah.
It's probably not so good for you,

2441
01:39:43,411 --> 01:39:45,380
but something about it.
It's just got the worst.

2442
01:39:45,381 --> 01:39:47,970
Is waking up the next day though in 
smelling your clothes.

2443
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:51,030
Oh god.
Even as a smoker that.

2444
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,350
That's disgusting.
Yeah.

2445
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:54,840
They stIll have one of those in orange 
county near where I live,

2446
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:56,790
um,
to bar with the pool tables and stuff.

2447
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:58,080
And you could smoke cigarettes inside.

2448
01:39:58,330 --> 01:40:03,330
I was having this conversation with a 
buddy of mine about those natural 

2449
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:03,820
cigarettes.
Are those things any better for you?

2450
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:09,090
I don't think so.
It's like vapor and there's like no 

2451
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:10,070
carcinogens in it or something like a 
little bit,

2452
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:11,780
but it's still tobacco,
right?

2453
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:13,460
Smoking tobacco is not good for you.
Right?

2454
01:40:13,461 --> 01:40:14,680
well,
there's no smoke.

2455
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:16,270
That's correct.
It's kind of like,

2456
01:40:16,271 --> 01:40:17,860
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about cigarettes,

2457
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:22,210
electronic cigarettes,
cigarettes.

2458
01:40:22,211 --> 01:40:23,620
I said natural,
like those,

2459
01:40:23,621 --> 01:40:28,621
those american spirits things like are 
those better for you or better for you 

2460
01:40:28,621 --> 01:40:30,590
because it doesn't have like 102 other 
chemicals in it and.

2461
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:31,770
YeaH.
Yeah.

2462
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:37,050
So yeah,
it's better for you than having a 

2463
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:37,050
marlboro light.
It is,

2464
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:37,870
but I also have noticed when I smoke 
those,

2465
01:40:37,871 --> 01:40:39,850
it's like,
it takes forever.

2466
01:40:39,851 --> 01:40:43,150
Like it's like two hours.
It's like I'm smoking 20 minutes instead

2467
01:40:43,151 --> 01:40:44,670
of five minutes.
You know,

2468
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:47,380
it's like a bonfire.
Just not the same.

2469
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,620
It's good.
I like it,

2470
01:40:50,621 --> 01:40:52,050
but it's.
If it feels like you're,

2471
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:53,980
you're smoking more bonfire.
That's

2472
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,620
an Interesting way of describing it.
Like when you get smoke in your mouth,

2473
01:40:56,621 --> 01:41:01,621
when you're near a fire,
it's like you cough on it tastes nasty 

2474
01:41:01,621 --> 01:41:02,170
leafy and drive like,
ooh,

2475
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,980
that doesn't sound good.
Let me go old bites.

2476
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:08,170
He barely even feel like you're smoking,
you know?

2477
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:12,100
It just feels calming or something.
I don't mind tobacco man.

2478
01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:14,890
I liked tobacco in the form of cigars.
Tobacco,

2479
01:41:14,891 --> 01:41:19,891
When you smoke a big cigar,
like especially if they have like a big 

2480
01:41:19,891 --> 01:41:21,400
meal and have a big cigar.
so garza gives you like a weird buzz man

2481
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:24,900
if you're trying to pipe what's her,
even if you're not in like inhaling Mr.

2482
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:25,390
Guy.
Oh yeah,

2483
01:41:25,391 --> 01:41:25,790
yeah,
yeah.

2484
01:41:26,110 --> 01:41:26,830
Oh yeah.
For sure.

2485
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:29,180
Because he just comes into your blood's 
dry,

2486
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:29,720
uh,
your uh,

2487
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:31,570
your bloodstream through your mouth 
immediately.

2488
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,160
By the way.
A lot of people don't know that,

2489
01:41:33,161 --> 01:41:34,990
but like anytime there's smoke in your 
mouth,

2490
01:41:34,991 --> 01:41:36,810
it's almost immediately in your blood 
sweat.

2491
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:39,550
That's when people say like,
I'm not going to inhale this weed.

2492
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:41,230
You know?
You're still getting fucking stone.

2493
01:41:41,231 --> 01:41:43,330
Yeah.
As bill clinton,

2494
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:46,360
you dumb so fucking dumb.
I didn't inhale.

2495
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:47,020
we.
Okay,

2496
01:41:47,021 --> 01:41:48,790
good.
Did he didn't get as high,

2497
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:50,440
right?
You still got high silly.

2498
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:53,710
You should not get high on andy.
Got bath salts pretty high.

2499
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,240
Are they gonna start recalling 
basketball.

2500
01:41:56,290 --> 01:42:01,290
Yeah.
They're making some bath salts illegal 

2501
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:01,290
in Ireland right now.
It's an epidemic all across the world.

2502
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:02,600
I wonder what it'd be like.
The snort mr.

2503
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,210
Bubble dude,
this shit.

2504
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:06,580
It's a weird thing is it's the names of 
it.

2505
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:09,430
Ivory wave,
bliss,

2506
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:10,770
white,
lightning,

2507
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:15,130
hurricane charley chemicals can cause 
hallucinations,

2508
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:19,150
paranoia,
rapid heart rates and suicidal thoughts.

2509
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,930
It makes you attack yourself and it 
makes your nose smell great.

2510
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:27,210
You know what your body is probably.
Your body's probably so mad that you're 

2511
01:42:27,461 --> 01:42:30,670
such a dumb cunt that you snort bath 
salts that your body's like,

2512
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:31,630
oh,
we're going to kill ourselves now.

2513
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:32,590
All right.
You want to do this bitch?

2514
01:42:32,591 --> 01:42:33,890
You want to do this?
Get a knife.

2515
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:34,330
Well,
can't you?

2516
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:39,440
I mean,
you can pretty much get fucked up on 

2517
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,240
almost anything if you want to get 
fucked up to the point where you want to

2518
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:42,250
slash your face off.
I mean,

2519
01:42:42,251 --> 01:42:43,780
they're listening to the things that 
people are doing,

2520
01:42:43,781 --> 01:42:44,230
man.
They're like,

2521
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,030
they're like attacking themselves.
Yeah.

2522
01:42:46,031 --> 01:42:48,310
They're still conscious and alive and 
causes.

2523
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:49,780
Apparently it's super,
um,

2524
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:53,140
the stimulants and our neurotransmitters
in the brain.

2525
01:42:53,141 --> 01:42:58,141
They're saying and this stuff,
mp mdpv and method drone or they're made

2526
01:42:59,261 --> 01:43:04,261
in the lab and there aren't regulated 
because they're not marketed for human 

2527
01:43:04,261 --> 01:43:05,770
consumption.
So these things are in these bath salts.

2528
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:08,700
How the fuck is this stuff in bass off 
that's like,

2529
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:12,550
you're like taking a bath with crank.
Like this is what you're doing.

2530
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,500
You're taking a bath with pcp.

2531
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:17,890
Why was that in there?
Isn't it supposed to be salt?

2532
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:23,430
What the fuck is going on?
And trips your pores open and then you 

2533
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:24,170
know,
it gets in there and washes around.

2534
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:29,820
It causes intense cravings for it and 
they'll binge on it for three to four 

2535
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:32,320
days before they show up in an er and 
even though it's a horrible trip,

2536
01:43:32,321 --> 01:43:35,200
they want to do it again and again.
It's incredibly addictive.

2537
01:43:35,410 --> 01:43:37,090
Wow.
This is nuts.

2538
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:40,420
Twenty five states have received calls 
about exposure,

2539
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:44,950
including Nevada and California.
Louisiana leads with the greatest number

2540
01:43:44,951 --> 01:43:49,840
of calls at 165.
One hundred and 65 fucking people.

2541
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:52,820
I need to go to bed,
bath and beyond tonight.

2542
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:55,370
Wow,
this is crazy.

2543
01:43:55,371 --> 01:43:56,780
You might as well try it before they 
recall it.

2544
01:43:57,300 --> 01:43:59,900
We stock up on it.
This is really nuts.

2545
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:03,920
Forty eight different calls are 38 
different calls.

2546
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:05,390
It's like the highest demanded drug.

2547
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:08,180
Now soap cast that.
That's what strange,

2548
01:44:08,181 --> 01:44:11,830
strange thing that all of a sudden they 
figured out that they get smart.

2549
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:14,420
It's almost like you found another hole 
in the system.

2550
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:16,370
Like people want to get high.
So bad.

2551
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:18,170
You know,
the fall we found this new shit.

2552
01:44:18,290 --> 01:44:20,780
Hundreds of people are doing this.
This is crazy.

2553
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:25,870
Wow.
Apparently it's not something you do 

2554
01:44:25,870 --> 01:44:25,870
recreational.
It's not like you're going to try to.

2555
01:44:25,870 --> 01:44:30,431
I didn't like it.
He'd do it and you get a face slash and 

2556
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:32,000
zombie.
Wow.

2557
01:44:32,001 --> 01:44:33,230
This is nuts,
man.

2558
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:38,380
I wonder if you could just do a little 
bit less of it and not turn into a face 

2559
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:39,040
slash name is already.
Maybe they're just doing way too much.

2560
01:44:39,041 --> 01:44:40,640
He kind of like,
whoa,

2561
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:42,620
here it is.
This is what they're saying.

2562
01:44:42,621 --> 01:44:47,621
The problem grew in rural Mississippi.
After a law began restricting the sale 

2563
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:51,710
of pseudo f,
f a dream,

2564
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:56,830
the key ingredient,
and making methamphetamine 

2565
01:44:56,830 --> 01:44:56,830
pseudoephedrine pseudoephedrine.

2566
01:44:56,830 --> 01:45:00,350
So when they stopped selling that stuff,
we're restricting the sale of it.

2567
01:45:00,351 --> 01:45:05,351
They couldn't get meth anymore,
so they got crazy and then they tried 

2568
01:45:05,351 --> 01:45:05,870
this shit.
This is worse than math.

2569
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:09,380
This is something that's fucking up meth
heads.

2570
01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:14,650
Like they used to just be meth heads and
then they started doing bass to cutting 

2571
01:45:14,650 --> 01:45:18,401
their faces off.
I want to hear about the kids who tried 

2572
01:45:18,401 --> 01:45:18,401
it,
who started this phenomenon.

2573
01:45:18,401 --> 01:45:20,620
I don't think it was the kids.
Yeah,

2574
01:45:20,670 --> 01:45:23,750
but it wasn't kids really.
Governor happened.

2575
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:26,660
I bet there was some fucking crazy guy 
like in that breaking bad show.

2576
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:27,330
There was some,
some,

2577
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:32,360
some sort of a scientist character and 
he realized that bath salts will fuck 

2578
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:33,440
you up to.
So just started giving them to people.

2579
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:35,900
That's possible,
but you can't even corner that market if

2580
01:45:35,901 --> 01:45:40,901
you tell them it's bath salts.
So they must have held at gunpoint to 

2581
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:44,111
get the secret sauce.
This is the greatest fucking crack of 

2582
01:45:44,111 --> 01:45:44,111
all time,
man.

2583
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:45,590
Shit,
I'm taking over the world.

2584
01:45:45,770 --> 01:45:46,540
Listen to co.

2585
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:52,450
Just magic getting to the point.
Remember when you used to get those 

2586
01:45:52,450 --> 01:45:53,230
things for christmas where it was like a
bag of bath salts,

2587
01:45:53,231 --> 01:45:58,231
you know,
it was like a decorative item given to 

2588
01:45:58,231 --> 01:45:58,231
you by,
uh,

2589
01:45:58,231 --> 01:45:58,231
like,
have you seen them?

2590
01:45:58,231 --> 01:46:01,060
It looks like a snowball,
right?

2591
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:02,410
And that's going to be like your,
your,

2592
01:46:02,411 --> 01:46:03,850
your april is one of those.

2593
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:06,810
Wow.
There aren't the,

2594
01:46:06,811 --> 01:46:08,540
aren't regulated.
That's the real problem.

2595
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:13,930
Meanwhile,
they just made fucking five methoxy 

2596
01:46:13,930 --> 01:46:13,930
dimethyltryptamine illegal.
They made.

2597
01:46:13,930 --> 01:46:14,900
It's super illegal.
Now you can't get it anywhere.

2598
01:46:14,901 --> 01:46:16,010
If you have it,
you're in trouble.

2599
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:21,340
That shit used to be able to.
You still have buying online five 

2600
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:25,451
methoxy dimethyltryptamine,
which is the most potent form of dmt 

2601
01:46:25,451 --> 01:46:26,300
used to be able to buy it online.
Yeah,

2602
01:46:26,301 --> 01:46:30,440
you can buy a jug of it and just get 
blasted on it till the end of time.

2603
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:32,990
Now it's a schedule one.
Yeah.

2604
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:36,080
Now it's right there with a.
With a marijuana.

2605
01:46:37,070 --> 01:46:38,300
Yeah.
Used to be able to just buy it.

2606
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:40,280
It's weird and then someone figured out 
like,

2607
01:46:40,281 --> 01:46:41,990
hey,
you can get really high off this shit,

2608
01:46:41,991 --> 01:46:44,150
and you just buy it online.
That's pretty silly.

2609
01:46:44,170 --> 01:46:46,790
If you get caught with acid,
you go to jail forever.

2610
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:50,550
Not forever,
but you get caught with anything.

2611
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:53,310
Anything like acid or playing footsies 
me here.

2612
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:57,210
If you get caught with any kind of acid,
you know any,

2613
01:46:57,211 --> 01:47:02,211
any,
anything where they think you're doing 

2614
01:47:02,211 --> 01:47:02,211
that.
When you're making your own drugs,

2615
01:47:02,211 --> 01:47:05,301
that's.
That's even crazier than mushrooms or 

2616
01:47:05,301 --> 01:47:05,301
pot because you're.
What are you doing?

2617
01:47:05,301 --> 01:47:09,430
You're.
You're synthesizing a chemicals 

2618
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:09,430
specifically for the purpose of getting 
people fucked up.

2619
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:09,900
A,
you're a.

2620
01:47:09,901 --> 01:47:12,360
You're a special case.
You're in a fucking.

2621
01:47:12,570 --> 01:47:17,570
You know,
you got like rubber gloves and shit and 

2622
01:47:17,570 --> 01:47:19,381
a lab coat on and your in your bathtub 
and you're making enough acid to get 

2623
01:47:19,381 --> 01:47:20,210
like a whole state high.
You can make a.

2624
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:23,110
You can make enough acid in your bathtub
to get like a million people

2625
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:25,350
excellently.
Splashing it onto your.

2626
01:47:25,370 --> 01:47:30,370
Oh my god,
it took me five years to make disaster 

2627
01:47:30,370 --> 01:47:32,410
because every time I would die for like 
two months.

2628
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:36,540
I met this girl a couple years ago and 
she told me that she has this friend who

2629
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:39,660
obviously went crazy,
moved away to a different state,

2630
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:44,690
but she got pulled over by the cops and 
had a whole vial of acid on her and she 

2631
01:47:44,690 --> 01:47:47,880
drank.
She tripped for like 60 days and fucking

2632
01:47:47,881 --> 01:47:50,610
like split town and like,
it's been a weirdo ever since.

2633
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:52,380
I never met the girl.
God,

2634
01:47:54,930 --> 01:47:58,470
why don't you just pour it on the ground
are ridiculous.

2635
01:47:59,600 --> 01:47:59,940
Or just

2636
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:00,950
start going doon,
doon,

2637
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:05,520
doon,
doon gould who do come to life.

2638
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:08,630
It becomes a transformer.
Wow.

2639
01:48:08,631 --> 01:48:13,631
I've heard stories about people.
That's the number one drug that I've 

2640
01:48:13,631 --> 01:48:13,631
heard stories about.
People losing their shit on.

2641
01:48:13,631 --> 01:48:14,570
Yeah.
Just breaking,

2642
01:48:14,890 --> 01:48:16,010
you know,
just see,

2643
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:20,000
you broke it broke it I think.
I think acid in any,

2644
01:48:20,001 --> 01:48:23,900
like any secondary given dmt.
I think if you do it a certain amount of

2645
01:48:23,901 --> 01:48:25,400
times,
you're probably not going to be the same

2646
01:48:25,401 --> 01:48:30,401
as before.
I knew what do to did it 100 times and 

2647
01:48:30,401 --> 01:48:32,711
he totally became crazy.
He just was doing dmt all the time to 

2648
01:48:32,711 --> 01:48:34,910
the point where when he would do dmt,
dmt entities would talk to him and go,

2649
01:48:34,911 --> 01:48:35,370
do,
do,

2650
01:48:35,371 --> 01:48:38,540
do,
do you get to stop coming here to settle

2651
01:48:38,541 --> 01:48:41,290
the fuck down and killing our bus.
Dmt.

2652
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:46,360
And when you have a dmt experience,
like a lot of it is marked by 

2653
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:47,150
communication with whatever the fuck it 
is.

2654
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:52,420
You could be that you're communicating 
with some other part of your 

2655
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:52,420
consciousness that you don't normally 
have access to.

2656
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:56,270
Or it could be the great beyond like 
this well of souls or it could be aliens

2657
01:48:56,271 --> 01:48:58,310
and another dimension.
You're communicating with something.

2658
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:00,080
Whatever it is is really just 
speculative.

2659
01:49:00,530 --> 01:49:02,570
But this guy,
when he would go over there,

2660
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,430
the dmt,
whatever he was connecting to,

2661
01:49:04,431 --> 01:49:04,970
what's going on?
Dude?

2662
01:49:04,971 --> 01:49:05,330
Dude,
dude,

2663
01:49:05,331 --> 01:49:06,050
dude,
stop.

2664
01:49:06,110 --> 01:49:08,220
Stop smoking.
Bmp everyday.

2665
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:13,240
This is crazy funny.
When the dmt spirits are actually 

2666
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:13,240
annoyed with you.
Come on dude,

2667
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:16,660
come here all the time.
Whether they fucking eat my food,

2668
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:20,420
your stinky feet or on my couch the fuck
bro.

2669
01:49:20,421 --> 01:49:23,080
Get it together.
That's funny.

2670
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:24,610
Yeah.
You know,

2671
01:49:24,611 --> 01:49:29,611
man,
until they figure out a way to let 

2672
01:49:29,611 --> 01:49:30,530
people do whatever the fuck they want 
with their bodies.

2673
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:35,620
Do whatever the fuck you want.
You're going to always have a gang of 

2674
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:38,821
different drug problems.
Where people are afraid of though is 

2675
01:49:38,821 --> 01:49:39,380
that when you start making everything 
legal,

2676
01:49:39,470 --> 01:49:41,840
well then you know,
we'll put kid could get a hold of it and

2677
01:49:41,841 --> 01:49:44,600
everyone could get addicted and that is 
definitely true.

2678
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:47,650
You do run those problems.
You do run a chance there being a little

2679
01:49:47,651 --> 01:49:48,310
bit of a spike

2680
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:52,210
once it becomes initially legal,
but you,

2681
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:54,670
you,
you're gonna have to let people learn.

2682
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,100
You have to raise your kids and tell 
them to never do that shit.

2683
01:49:57,250 --> 01:50:00,520
You have to be around other people that 
raise their kids and tell them,

2684
01:50:00,521 --> 01:50:01,420
you know,
don't do math.

2685
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:02,210
It's gonna.
Kill you.

2686
01:50:02,211 --> 01:50:03,610
I don't do heroin.
It's bad for you.

2687
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:06,130
You could smoke pot.
It's not going to hurt you if you drank,

2688
01:50:06,131 --> 01:50:07,420
let me know.
I want to be there.

2689
01:50:07,421 --> 01:50:09,520
I want to let you know.
I want to make sure you don't drive home

2690
01:50:09,521 --> 01:50:10,420
drunk.
You know,

2691
01:50:10,421 --> 01:50:15,421
like you can.
People can navigate their way through a 

2692
01:50:15,421 --> 01:50:16,210
lot of different substances and the 
society if you just allowed us to,

2693
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:21,630
you know,
but as soon as you start making shit 

2694
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:21,630
illegal and restricting the,
you know,

2695
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:22,030
the access to a bunch of different 
things,

2696
01:50:22,031 --> 01:50:23,890
people can't figure out what's good and 
what's bad.

2697
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:26,260
That's why there's a lot of people to 
think that mushrooms will fuck your mind

2698
01:50:26,261 --> 01:50:27,950
up.
Know and that smoke pot,

2699
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:29,560
you're become a lazy piece of shit.
Why?

2700
01:50:29,561 --> 01:50:31,240
Because they don't have access to it.
If they have,

2701
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:33,970
if everybody had access to it,
especially wheat,

2702
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,470
if everybody had access to,
we'd,

2703
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:40,590
we would all think of it the same way 
that stoners think of it stolen or is 

2704
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:40,900
pretty much universally look at pot and 
say,

2705
01:50:40,901 --> 01:50:42,190
well,
it's very beneficial to me.

2706
01:50:42,191 --> 01:50:44,020
It calms me down.
It gives you perspective.

2707
01:50:44,021 --> 01:50:46,690
It makes me silly and then there's the 
medical uses for it all.

2708
01:50:46,691 --> 01:50:51,691
I mean,
it's like universal amongst the people 

2709
01:50:51,691 --> 01:50:51,691
that use it.
Well,

2710
01:50:51,691 --> 01:50:51,691
how come the other people don't share 
that opinion?

2711
01:50:51,691 --> 01:50:52,630
Well,
it's because they're not using it.

2712
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,420
It's really that simple.
The people that are anti pot,

2713
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:58,270
it's possible that you have some weird 
reaction to pot,

2714
01:50:58,500 --> 01:50:59,650
in which case I would say,
hey,

2715
01:50:59,651 --> 01:51:00,130
don't do it.

2716
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:01,180
You know,
you don't have to do it,

2717
01:51:01,540 --> 01:51:06,540
but I guarantee you if you're not doing 
it and you're describing what it is you 

2718
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:10,660
don't know or they a mom or a dad or 
brother that was like lazy as shit while

2719
01:51:10,661 --> 01:51:11,550
they spoke to me,
is that like,

2720
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:15,040
oh no,
I totally get that.

2721
01:51:15,041 --> 01:51:15,460
And I'm like,
no,

2722
01:51:15,461 --> 01:51:17,080
it's not like that.
Your brother is fucking lazy.

2723
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:20,110
They don't see enough ambitious donors 
out there.

2724
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:24,490
People don't understand it.
It will give you a different perspective

2725
01:51:24,491 --> 01:51:26,440
and it might not necessarily be a better
perspective,

2726
01:51:26,441 --> 01:51:28,840
but it's good to look at things a 
different way all the time.

2727
01:51:29,230 --> 01:51:30,750
Every now and then rather,
you know,

2728
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:32,440
if you look at things the exact same 
way,

2729
01:51:32,441 --> 01:51:36,250
you can get locked into sort of a mental
pattern where you think that things make

2730
01:51:36,251 --> 01:51:37,270
sense,
you know,

2731
01:51:37,271 --> 01:51:38,590
and then you need like a,
a good,

2732
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:43,710
good,
really fucking good real good bake 

2733
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:45,250
session where you just completely float 
away,

2734
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:50,550
you know,
when you and your friends are sitting 

2735
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:50,550
around like how many times did we had 
these conversations like especially like

2736
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:52,510
after shows or were just completely 
barbecued,

2737
01:51:52,511 --> 01:51:57,511
like eating dinner and we're all just 
like breaking down the universe or 

2738
01:51:57,511 --> 01:52:00,451
figuring out life or just having these 
conversations where you almost connect.

2739
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:02,790
Can't get there on your own.
You don't.

2740
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:07,830
There's some conversations with you.
You get to when you're high and you're 

2741
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:07,830
like,
man,

2742
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:08,230
I don't think I can take responsibility 
for this conversation.

2743
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:09,410
I don't think I ever would have got 
here.

2744
01:52:09,411 --> 01:52:10,780
Everyone was on high,
you know?

2745
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:17,750
Of course a lot of those conversations 
are not as cool as they would be in 

2746
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:21,261
there.
Just talking about how fritos would be 

2747
01:52:21,261 --> 01:52:21,261
getting a peanut butter and jelly 
sandwich.

2748
01:52:21,261 --> 01:52:23,400
You know,
I like those talks.

2749
01:52:23,401 --> 01:52:28,401
I was really,
really nice marijuana driven talks 

2750
01:52:28,401 --> 01:52:28,401
because you can't get that when you're 
hammered.

2751
01:52:28,401 --> 01:52:28,401
No,
no,

2752
01:52:28,401 --> 01:52:28,700
you don't.
Right.

2753
01:52:28,770 --> 01:52:31,810
It's more like a good,
a good stone

2754
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:33,250
conversation.
Not a dumb one,

2755
01:52:33,251 --> 01:52:38,251
but a good one.
You know everybody's kind of in that 

2756
01:52:38,251 --> 01:52:40,441
grove man.
You figured out a lot of shit in those 

2757
01:52:40,441 --> 01:52:40,441
conversations.

2758
01:52:40,441 --> 01:52:41,910
The nick swardson have a jaguar,
a,

2759
01:52:41,911 --> 01:52:42,950
I don't know.
No category.

2760
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:46,460
They just put on tmz that he.
Somebody stole his jaguar

2761
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:49,190
last week outside the improv on a friday
night,

2762
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:52,900
but it happens or he's just trolling 
tmz.

2763
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:56,310
Do you think you would troll dmz?
I don't see him having.

2764
01:52:56,360 --> 01:53:01,360
He didn't have.
You can't say that you got your car 

2765
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,401
stolen.
They can find that out pretty easily 

2766
01:53:03,401 --> 01:53:06,460
unless there's that lazy.
Well not the felony to tell tmz ally 

2767
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:09,080
behind it.
Not just telling tmz.

2768
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:11,630
Tmz.
You just can say whatever.

2769
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:17,180
Yeah.
You can say whatever the fuck you want 

2770
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:17,180
those concepts.
The whole.

2771
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:20,960
The fucking jim norton.
Over this weekend I saw jim norton at 

2772
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:21,230
cap city comedy club and I was in 
austin.

2773
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:24,020
I was down in austin for the fight for 
the troops and I had friday off,

2774
01:53:24,021 --> 01:53:29,021
so I went to cap city at norton,
had some of the funniest fucking jokes 

2775
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:32,450
on tiger woods.
Oh my god.

2776
01:53:32,451 --> 01:53:36,020
He was killing me and mel gibson,
he was fucking killing me dude.

2777
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,090
Really,
really funny shit.

2778
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:39,410
Putting out with them after.
Yeah,

2779
01:53:39,411 --> 01:53:39,740
yeah,
yeah.

2780
01:53:39,741 --> 01:53:41,300
We,
we went out to eat and club soda.

2781
01:53:41,301 --> 01:53:43,990
Kenny was there and chris,
chris from the flusher joe.

2782
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:45,050
Yeah.
He's a good guy.

2783
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:47,210
And uh,
but it was just,

2784
01:53:47,211 --> 01:53:50,530
it was so fun and refreshing and right 
when I think that,

2785
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:53,120
like I always start thinking maybe I 
have too many dick jokes.

2786
01:53:53,450 --> 01:53:55,820
Like why is my sense of humor so 
juvenile,

2787
01:53:55,940 --> 01:54:00,940
like it's always like someone sucking 
dicks or some dick goes in there or you 

2788
01:54:00,940 --> 01:54:02,000
know,
whatever.

2789
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:04,220
It just becomes a dick joke somewhere or
another.

2790
01:54:04,221 --> 01:54:06,320
I mean,
time machine jokes become dick jokes.

2791
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:08,630
Just I have a really juvenile sense of 
humor.

2792
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,490
And I was like,
maybe there's a problem with that.

2793
01:54:10,890 --> 01:54:11,930
I know.
That's what I like.

2794
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,080
Well maybe I should expand that out.
Let me try to like,

2795
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:19,240
relax.
And then I saw norton and every other 

2796
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:19,580
job was a dick joke and I fucking how 
old all the way through.

2797
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:22,110
Like it literally every other joke and 
we had a conversation about it.

2798
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:27,120
I go,
you like gave me like positive 

2799
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:28,871
affirmation.
Like sometimes I worry that I have too 

2800
01:54:28,871 --> 01:54:28,871
many dick jokes.
He goes,

2801
01:54:28,871 --> 01:54:28,871
oh,
I never think about that.

2802
01:54:28,871 --> 01:54:31,400
Think about that because that's what I 
think about some of them.

2803
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:34,160
Sick fucking person.
He's funny,

2804
01:54:34,161 --> 01:54:35,270
man.
He was really funny.

2805
01:54:35,271 --> 01:54:37,700
It was refreshing.
It's good to see,

2806
01:54:37,930 --> 01:54:39,830
you know,
we work all the time.

2807
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:44,831
It's like I don't get to see like a,
a full headliner set that's like real 

2808
01:54:44,831 --> 01:54:48,161
rare that I get to see someone in a 
comedy club working and just be an 

2809
01:54:48,161 --> 01:54:49,220
audience member and sit down there.
So it was cool man.

2810
01:54:49,221 --> 01:54:50,660
It was fucking,
I was howling.

2811
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:52,190
But here's a weird thing,
man.

2812
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:55,490
There was these two local comics that 
were watching and the fucking,

2813
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:57,170
he was killing.
Okay.

2814
01:54:57,290 --> 01:54:58,850
Norton was fucking killing.

2815
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:04,060
And these two guys were watching like 
this hate or sad faced just totally dead

2816
01:55:04,281 --> 01:55:05,570
face.
And I was like,

2817
01:55:05,571 --> 01:55:06,860
wow,
that's weird.

2818
01:55:06,861 --> 01:55:07,970
Like,
do you don't think this is.

2819
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:09,740
I was crying,
laughing,

2820
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:11,030
you know,
at certain points.

2821
01:55:11,031 --> 01:55:13,850
I mean,
it's just really well crafted jokes.

2822
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,280
Really funny here.
This bit about tiger woods,

2823
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:16,940
about.
I don't,

2824
01:55:16,941 --> 01:55:18,830
I don't want to do it.
I don't want to fuck it up.

2825
01:55:19,310 --> 01:55:21,020
I don't want to paraphrase it,
I don't want to ruin it.

2826
01:55:21,021 --> 01:55:23,630
But uh,
I was crying,

2827
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:28,990
I was fucking crying and I looked over.
These guys are stone faced haters,

2828
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,110
haters.
Also.

2829
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:36,130
They're trying to,
they're probably fascinated like it's a 

2830
01:55:36,130 --> 01:55:36,290
big deal to be working with a big name.
Jim norton's a big name national act,

2831
01:55:36,291 --> 01:55:37,790
you know,
so then they get to work with them.

2832
01:55:37,791 --> 01:55:39,800
Then they're judging their own 
performance against his.

2833
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:43,180
Trying to think of there better than his
jealousy with comedy,

2834
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:44,050
especially the,
the,

2835
01:55:44,050 --> 01:55:45,180
the guys,
they were like,

2836
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:45,770
I could do

2837
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:48,280
better than this person.
Well there's a lot of guys that are just

2838
01:55:48,281 --> 01:55:53,281
starting out or they've been doing it 
for a couple of years that for some 

2839
01:55:53,281 --> 01:55:55,831
reason they feel like your success like 
takes away from their success and they 

2840
01:55:55,831 --> 01:55:56,460
should have more success when they do 
look.

2841
01:55:56,461 --> 01:55:57,520
Very weird thing,
man,

2842
01:55:58,570 --> 01:56:03,570
to be a person that wants to be on stage
with their voice amplified in a 

2843
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:05,020
spotlight on you.
You've got to be fucked up.

2844
01:56:05,021 --> 01:56:07,960
And I'm talking as one of them and I'm 
talking to two other ones.

2845
01:56:07,990 --> 01:56:09,670
You guys are both comics,
you know,

2846
01:56:09,671 --> 01:56:10,840
you both do stand up,
you know,

2847
01:56:10,841 --> 01:56:13,510
you've got to be fucking crazy to want 
to do that.

2848
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:18,780
And so a lot of these people,
they're like so desperate to even out 

2849
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:19,720
their life,
they're so desperate to finally get some

2850
01:56:19,721 --> 01:56:24,721
success.
So desperate to put it all together and 

2851
01:56:24,721 --> 01:56:27,151
have the big picture in front of them 
and finally move on past this disaster 

2852
01:56:27,151 --> 01:56:27,151
of a childhood that they,
you know,

2853
01:56:27,151 --> 01:56:28,660
they didn't want to claim ownership of 
their life.

2854
01:56:28,661 --> 01:56:30,400
So they get like super hyper ambitious.

2855
01:56:30,730 --> 01:56:32,950
I met people who are like,
you know,

2856
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,000
I hate sand up.
I just get up on stage because it's 

2857
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:38,000
challenging for me,
but I hated every second of it.

2858
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:38,640
And I'm like,
that's strange.

2859
01:56:38,670 --> 01:56:40,200
Who says that

2860
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:43,480
you can be good and say that you have to
suck this period.

2861
01:56:43,570 --> 01:56:48,570
Except steve martin.
Steve martin didn't like standing up in 

2862
01:56:48,570 --> 01:56:48,570
the end,
you know,

2863
01:56:48,570 --> 01:56:49,120
he was a,
it was too easy for them apparently,

2864
01:56:49,121 --> 01:56:50,200
and he was awesome.
You know,

2865
01:56:50,201 --> 01:56:53,140
let's get small.
That's some fucking great shit.

2866
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:56,130
Like I remember when the jerk came out,
steve martin was holding

2867
01:56:56,740 --> 01:56:59,630
various johnson navan sounds like a 
typical day.

2868
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:02,100
Fun shit man.
He was a funny,

2869
01:57:02,101 --> 01:57:05,670
funny comedian man,
but he just got too crazy.

2870
01:57:05,671 --> 01:57:06,330
He would,
he would.

2871
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:11,390
He was so big that everything he said 
got laughs and like he lost perspective 

2872
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:11,640
and like,
you know,

2873
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:13,530
we stopped doing it.
He was so good.

2874
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:14,580
He had a stop

2875
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:18,020
man.
He,

2876
01:57:18,070 --> 01:57:18,590
he,
he,

2877
01:57:18,630 --> 01:57:21,440
he was such a let down for me because I 
was such a huge.

2878
01:57:21,441 --> 01:57:23,540
Steve martin was the letdown.
It was just,

2879
01:57:23,541 --> 01:57:28,541
you know,
that that part like around sergeant 

2880
01:57:28,541 --> 01:57:31,431
bilko years where he just kind of lost 
the part that was funny to me about 

2881
01:57:31,701 --> 01:57:36,701
them.
It's like I can't really tell what it 

2882
01:57:36,701 --> 01:57:36,701
is.
It's exactly what it is.

2883
01:57:36,701 --> 01:57:36,701
Just age I guess.

2884
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,220
So it happens to all of them.
It happens to almost everyone.

2885
01:57:39,430 --> 01:57:42,430
It's very difficult to maintain a sense 
of humor as first of all,

2886
01:57:42,431 --> 01:57:45,370
as your body starts to decay and second 
of all,

2887
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:48,550
as you have all these relationship 
problems,

2888
01:57:48,551 --> 01:57:49,760
which they always do.
No,

2889
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:54,800
you just have these fantastic weddings.
It turn into bitter divorces and then 

2890
01:57:55,391 --> 01:57:56,110
you wonder,
well,

2891
01:57:56,111 --> 01:58:01,111
this is it.
I'm here already and now I'm 45 or 

2892
01:58:01,111 --> 01:58:01,480
something like that and um,
I'm a movie star and I'm making all this

2893
01:58:01,481 --> 01:58:06,481
money and I don't even enjoy myself and 
I don't even enjoy the product and what 

2894
01:58:06,481 --> 01:58:07,780
is funny anymore.
And when you're not doing stand up,

2895
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:13,020
when you don't have that immediate,
for me at least i would not be 

2896
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:16,381
confident.
And whether or not what I think is 

2897
01:58:16,381 --> 01:58:16,381
funny.
I know,

2898
01:58:16,381 --> 01:58:16,750
I know that I know how to make things 
funny.

2899
01:58:16,751 --> 01:58:21,751
I know,
I know what things are funny and aren't 

2900
01:58:21,751 --> 01:58:21,751
funny because I do stand up so much.

2901
01:58:21,751 --> 01:58:23,560
So it's like you become immersed in the 
language of comedy,

2902
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:28,680
but when you're removed from that,
completely removed from the idea or the 

2903
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:31,160
act of creating the comedy and then 
producing it and putting it on stage and

2904
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:36,200
performing it.
And then honing it and then sharpening 

2905
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:36,200
up the bits and,
and you learn things from that like,

2906
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:40,950
oh,
that was way better when I did it this 

2907
01:58:40,950 --> 01:58:40,950
way because I got to it quicker and the 
people understood it better.

2908
01:58:40,950 --> 01:58:43,510
You become in the language of company b,
you stay good,

2909
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:45,760
you stay good.
But when they stopped doing comedy,

2910
01:58:45,761 --> 01:58:50,761
man,
he stopped writing comedy and they just 

2911
01:58:50,761 --> 01:58:50,761
sort of like,
just acting in movies for awhile.

2912
01:58:50,761 --> 01:58:54,540
Like you just,
you might as well be living on mars 

2913
01:58:54,540 --> 01:58:54,540
motherfucker.
You're not even living with people.

2914
01:58:54,540 --> 01:58:56,510
You're walking around in a plastic 
bubble and people are getting used to,

2915
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:01,520
you know,
bagels and lox at the craft service 

2916
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:01,520
table and you pull it up in a ferrari 
and complaining,

2917
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:03,650
you know,
because there's an up knocking it shit,

2918
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:09,470
you know,
and you go into set and you're getting 

2919
01:59:09,470 --> 01:59:09,470
makeup put on,
you know,

2920
01:59:09,470 --> 01:59:13,170
they're fucking fitting a hairpiece to 
you to make your hair look big and 

2921
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:13,170
thick.

2922
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:13,240
You know what I mean?
That's what it was kind of a weird world

2923
01:59:13,241 --> 01:59:18,241
is that you're walking down the carpet 
and then that's your interaction with 

2924
01:59:18,241 --> 01:59:21,541
humans.
Your interaction with humans is on the 

2925
01:59:21,541 --> 01:59:23,341
set and people serving you and then your
next project and it's always this weird 

2926
01:59:23,341 --> 01:59:27,601
relationship where you're a star and 
their underlings and they all need to 

2927
01:59:27,601 --> 01:59:30,370
keep you happy to keep their job and so 
everyone's like super supportive and you

2928
01:59:30,371 --> 01:59:32,320
don't even know what the fuck is up and 
what's down.

2929
01:59:32,321 --> 01:59:35,170
You just drunk all the time.
It was fucked up on pills,

2930
01:59:35,770 --> 01:59:36,390
you know,
you know,

2931
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:41,400
you don't even know.
It's the reason why so many of these 

2932
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:42,040
guys become completely insane.
You know,

2933
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:42,720
that,
that,

2934
01:59:42,721 --> 01:59:44,980
that world,
the idea of living like that,

2935
01:59:44,981 --> 01:59:49,981
it's just,
you've got to be out of your fucking 

2936
01:59:49,981 --> 01:59:51,331
head.
One of the most frustrating things ever 

2937
01:59:51,331 --> 01:59:51,331
when I first moved to hollywood is just 
dealing with actors.

2938
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:56,520
You know,
guys who have done it their whole lives 

2939
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,921
and guys who had been involved in the 
business for decades and she'd be 

2940
01:59:58,921 --> 02:00:00,040
dealing with them and you aren't even 
fucking real.

2941
02:00:00,070 --> 02:00:00,850
You know,
you just,

2942
02:00:00,851 --> 02:00:05,851
you're so odd and fake and everybody's 
fake and everybody accepts that 

2943
02:00:06,071 --> 02:00:11,071
everyone's fake.
No one's calling anybody out at any of 

2944
02:00:11,071 --> 02:00:11,071
this and the behavior is so strange.
You know,

2945
02:00:11,071 --> 02:00:12,280
everybody's pompous and

2946
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:17,470
she does a lot of extra work and so 
she's always on sets with like,

2947
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:21,630
like she was on set the other day with a
was that guy's name the rapper,

2948
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:27,420
ll cool j and stuff like that.
Did you ever have any crazy stories of 

2949
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:29,200
working with some of these people?
Because this is funny.

2950
02:00:29,201 --> 02:00:31,840
A ll cool j's walking aRound.
I didn't know who it was.

2951
02:00:31,841 --> 02:00:35,380
One point at ll cool j.
Nobody looks like I've only heard him.

2952
02:00:35,490 --> 02:00:37,510
I never looked at a picture.
What was the other thing that you didn't

2953
02:00:37,511 --> 02:00:38,350
know?
That we were talking?

2954
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:40,390
He doesn't know a lot of stuff,
which is kind of cool.

2955
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:42,030
Something yesterday that was really 
weird.

2956
02:00:42,770 --> 02:00:47,770
Oh,
you didn't know aBout the howard stern 

2957
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:47,770
show?
you didn't know who robin was that there

2958
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:47,770
was.

2959
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:50,810
That to me is she doesn't know a lot of 
things like,

2960
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:52,860
like you go do you know this tv show?
She's like,

2961
02:00:52,861 --> 02:00:54,600
what cosby show?
That doesn't make sense.

2962
02:00:54,750 --> 02:00:55,930
I Would think it would be able to do.

2963
02:00:56,330 --> 02:01:01,330
Most people would be able to name who 
robin quivers was and howard and know 

2964
02:01:01,330 --> 02:01:05,081
that more people would know that.
Then know who was president before 

2965
02:01:05,081 --> 02:01:05,081
clinton.

2966
02:01:05,081 --> 02:01:06,550
Yeah.
But you know nowadays howard stern,

2967
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:07,770
she's 22.
You,

2968
02:01:07,930 --> 02:01:12,930
she,
she missed that big howard stern 

2969
02:01:12,930 --> 02:01:12,930
willing.
YeaH,

2970
02:01:12,930 --> 02:01:13,030
I mean the point.
Okay.

2971
02:01:13,031 --> 02:01:15,940
Because he was on satellite radio when 
you were like in high school.

2972
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,260
Right.
Okay.

2973
02:01:17,261 --> 02:01:19,500
That makes sense.
Right.

2974
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:20,560
Wow.
It's still same.

2975
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:21,850
Insane.
Yeah.

2976
02:01:22,390 --> 02:01:23,190
So what about.
Okay.

2977
02:01:23,191 --> 02:01:23,740
Anyway,
go ahead.

2978
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:24,550
L cool.
J.

2979
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:29,900
So you didn't know who l cool j dot.
I didn't know what ll cool j looked 

2980
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:34,021
like,
but someone pointed out to me and he's 

2981
02:01:34,021 --> 02:01:34,021
going up all on set all around like the 
girls and he's like,

2982
02:01:34,021 --> 02:01:35,890
hey ladies,
how you do in rubbing their shoulders?

2983
02:01:35,891 --> 02:01:36,320
He's like,
hey,

2984
02:01:36,330 --> 02:01:37,120
yeah,
you looking good?

2985
02:01:37,121 --> 02:01:39,830
What you doing?
I'm looking at him this and I'm like,

2986
02:01:39,831 --> 02:01:40,040
this

2987
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:45,040
guy is ridiculous.
He's walking around like he owned the 

2988
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:45,040
place touching all these young girls and
they're like,

2989
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:46,250
oh,
and I'm like,

2990
02:01:46,251 --> 02:01:47,660
you better not touch me.
I'm like,

2991
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:50,750
please use your ll cool j credit.
Just to be like,

2992
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:55,780
hey ladies.
I just thought it was like kind of a 

2993
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:55,780
douchey his thing.

2994
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:57,350
But were you hating because he didn't 
come rub on you?

2995
02:01:57,400 --> 02:01:58,350
Oh no.
WHat am I.

2996
02:01:58,351 --> 02:02:01,460
A cycle with the girls.
Girls not like it.

2997
02:02:02,010 --> 02:02:02,930
No,
the girls were into it.

2998
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:03,800
I'm just looking at it.
I'm like,

2999
02:02:03,801 --> 02:02:06,120
that's so unreal.
Like he just walking around like if theY

3000
02:02:06,121 --> 02:02:07,400
liked it,
what's the problem?

3001
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:09,600
If they liked it and he liked doing it.
Yeah.

3002
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:10,310
I don't know.
It's just,

3003
02:02:10,311 --> 02:02:12,050
it's odd.
You thought that he was gonna do to you.

3004
02:02:12,051 --> 02:02:13,390
That's why it was weird.
No,

3005
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:18,400
it's just weird that he does it because 
he's ll cool j because a regular guy 

3006
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:19,220
who's not his status wouldn't walk 
around like.

3007
02:02:19,221 --> 02:02:21,070
Yeah,
right.

3008
02:02:21,170 --> 02:02:24,050
But he is ll cool j,
right?

3009
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:25,680
Yeah,
that's what she's saying is weird.

3010
02:02:25,681 --> 02:02:28,140
It's just like a normal person.
He's walking up.

3011
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:31,850
Is he using that credit?
If the girls actually like it,

3012
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:33,170
that's where it gets tricky.

3013
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:37,620
If they actually like him doing that,
is he using it or not even saying that?

3014
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:39,910
She's just saying it's weird seeing 
somebody act like a planner.

3015
02:02:39,930 --> 02:02:42,620
I don't give a shit.
I totally agree with you,

3016
02:02:42,621 --> 02:02:45,200
but if they like it,
is it still weird?

3017
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:46,490
Like if,
if I saw that,

3018
02:02:46,491 --> 02:02:48,530
it would be weird if I saw some guy 
walking around going,

3019
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:49,410
hey,
what's up baby?

3020
02:02:49,411 --> 02:02:50,330
It's ooh,
gimme kiss,

3021
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:55,310
but why would we judge this if we,
if he's enjoying it and they're enjoying

3022
02:02:55,311 --> 02:02:56,420
it.
You knoW what I'm saying?

3023
02:02:56,450 --> 02:02:58,220
It's one thing if you came up to you and
you were like,

3024
02:02:58,250 --> 02:02:59,510
okay,
this is fucking.

3025
02:02:59,511 --> 02:03:00,820
I just came here to work.
All right.

3026
02:03:00,830 --> 02:03:03,500
I don't want to be weirded out by some 
cultive personality,

3027
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:07,220
but that'd be me being prissy.
Then that's not you being prissy.

3028
02:03:07,290 --> 02:03:10,160
You know,
I just thought it was someone should not

3029
02:03:10,161 --> 02:03:10,910
violate your space.

3030
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:12,010
like if,
if you know,

3031
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:14,120
if there was like if you were there or 
you know,

3032
02:03:14,121 --> 02:03:16,550
you're dating guy and he's right next to
you and your uncle jay did that,

3033
02:03:16,551 --> 02:03:17,750
that would be disrespectful,
right?

3034
02:03:17,751 --> 02:03:18,410
Yeah,
of course.

3035
02:03:18,411 --> 02:03:20,240
Right.
Well that then it's disrespectful.

3036
02:03:20,241 --> 02:03:22,280
Even if your boyfriend's not there,
you're not supposed to go up to someone.

3037
02:03:22,281 --> 02:03:23,480
Just start touching them.
You know,

3038
02:03:23,530 --> 02:03:25,820
you gotta she's gotta know that you,
you know,

3039
02:03:25,821 --> 02:03:28,820
you like him first or there's got to be 
some communication going,

3040
02:03:28,821 --> 02:03:29,810
hey,
can I rub your shoulders?

3041
02:03:29,811 --> 02:03:32,970
You can't just go up and start rubbing 
people he was doing and he liked it.

3042
02:03:32,971 --> 02:03:37,971
I liked it.
Could be guessed that to like the 

3043
02:03:37,971 --> 02:03:38,100
clinton move and clinton will just pull 
his dick out on girls' jail.

3044
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:40,010
Clinton used to do that.
yeah,

3045
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:41,310
dude,
he did it a bunch of times.

3046
02:03:41,311 --> 02:03:43,280
They're just hilarious because it's like
a frat boy move.

3047
02:03:43,490 --> 02:03:48,490
Like clinton would be alone with chicks 
and just pull his dick out and people 

3048
02:03:48,490 --> 02:03:48,490
go,
how could he do that?

3049
02:03:48,490 --> 02:03:50,650
I'll tell you how he could do that 
because it works.

3050
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:53,840
It probably worked 80 percent of the 
time.

3051
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:55,700
You know,
it probably worked even more than that.

3052
02:03:55,701 --> 02:03:59,120
He's fucking bill clinton.
If I bet if he felt of thing,

3053
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:01,760
he felt the green light,
I'm going to go for it.

3054
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:04,820
I bet he whipped out his dick and like 
80 percent of the time it was a,

3055
02:04:04,830 --> 02:04:06,380
it was a home run,
but it was those,

3056
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:09,950
the awkward 20 that would just,
it would just crash into the woods,

3057
02:04:09,951 --> 02:04:13,750
like he misread them or they just got so
offended that he would do that,

3058
02:04:13,751 --> 02:04:15,590
that they just flipped over the other 
way,

3059
02:04:15,591 --> 02:04:16,610
you know,
whatever the fuck it is.

3060
02:04:16,611 --> 02:04:18,940
But he would rock that all the time.
That's what he would do.

3061
02:04:18,941 --> 02:04:22,310
And just pull his dick out.
What's your hatred of hot chicks?

3062
02:04:23,330 --> 02:04:26,210
But hold on a second.
I'm not finished there.

3063
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:31,840
So that's like what ll cool j is doing.
He's doing a very mild version of 

3064
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:32,360
pulling his dick out.
He just going for it.

3065
02:04:32,430 --> 02:04:32,970
Yeah,
I guess so.

3066
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:35,450
So if you're with a guy,
right,

3067
02:04:35,570 --> 02:04:38,040
and you really attracted the guy and he 
pulls dick out his

3068
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:41,600
dick out and you just go for it.
Just be like,

3069
02:04:41,610 --> 02:04:45,150
what do you think?
I am like really into them.

3070
02:04:45,210 --> 02:04:47,610
If you're really into the guy,
it's possible.

3071
02:04:47,611 --> 02:04:48,650
Right.
If you were.

3072
02:04:48,651 --> 02:04:51,810
If I was to check into it was a perfect 
situation,

3073
02:04:51,811 --> 02:04:56,811
the perfect circumstance.
The guy pulls his dick out and got to 

3074
02:04:56,811 --> 02:04:56,811
go,
what the hell?

3075
02:04:56,811 --> 02:05:00,020
I think there's a difference though if 
like really liking ll cool j because 

3076
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:00,810
he's you a celebrity and liking his rap 
and then thinking,

3077
02:05:00,811 --> 02:05:02,430
okay,
now he has his dick out.

3078
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:04,470
Wait,
we're not talking about ll cool j.

3079
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:08,490
President is a different story.
We're mixing up our metaphors,

3080
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:12,030
but I think I totally agree with you.
I would think it would be gross too,

3081
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:16,620
but if they like it and he likes it,
then it's a match made in heaven.

3082
02:05:18,070 --> 02:05:19,560
Heaven.
Well,

3083
02:05:19,561 --> 02:05:21,540
you know,
I mean I bet a lot of girls that come on

3084
02:05:21,541 --> 02:05:22,710
the show just to meet him.

3085
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:24,900
You know ll cool j suck symbol,
right?

3086
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,570
One of those freaky bitches.
They'd probably come on shore.

3087
02:05:27,571 --> 02:05:29,450
They probably act as extras just to be 
lol.

3088
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:32,790
I can't believe he right there.
Oh my goodness.

3089
02:05:32,850 --> 02:05:35,550
It's probably mostly 40 year old women 
own 30 year old woman.

3090
02:05:35,590 --> 02:05:38,040
Really young girls going,
oh my god,

3091
02:05:38,041 --> 02:05:39,180
ll cool j.
You're crazy.

3092
02:05:39,210 --> 02:05:44,210
He's a stud.
He's 22 years old right here.

3093
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:47,850
Built like a linebacker.
You might think like,

3094
02:05:48,090 --> 02:05:49,980
girls think that that's sexy,
but I'm like,

3095
02:05:49,981 --> 02:05:53,970
I see a 45 year old man who's probably 
married.

3096
02:05:53,971 --> 02:05:55,740
I don't know,
but he just looks like a man.

3097
02:05:55,741 --> 02:05:58,500
Like he looks.
It's not sexy.

3098
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:03,210
Ll cool j is sexy,
very sexy.

3099
02:06:04,860 --> 02:06:07,590
He's built.
He's got fucking workout books.

3100
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:09,750
Was on the cover.
Completely shredded.

3101
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:13,670
Hating my own theory is starting to 
become correct.

3102
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:15,070
What is the ll cool j theory?
I don't know.

3103
02:06:15,090 --> 02:06:17,730
This is the second time we've talked 
about ll cool j and then you've defended

3104
02:06:17,731 --> 02:06:18,930
his honor.
So I'm thinking,

3105
02:06:18,931 --> 02:06:23,931
well,
I probably wouldn't want to hang out 

3106
02:06:23,931 --> 02:06:24,230
with the dude,
but I do.

3107
02:06:24,270 --> 02:06:28,020
I defend his right to be cocky.
Ll cool j pulled it off,

3108
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:29,430
you know,
plus he's a rapper.

3109
02:06:29,431 --> 02:06:31,380
Rappers have to be cocky.
That's part of the sport.

3110
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:32,340
Yeah.
I don't know if it's just me.

3111
02:06:32,341 --> 02:06:35,850
It's attractive to know a guy it like 
physical fitness,

3112
02:06:35,851 --> 02:06:38,530
but it's not like hot because they're 
like muscular bill.

3113
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:39,610
That's all.
That's all you.

3114
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:44,720
Everybody's different.
Everybody has different guys like fat 

3115
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:44,970
chicks,
like a big,

3116
02:06:44,971 --> 02:06:46,470
big fat ones.
We have friends.

3117
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:50,130
We have to get this one fan.
He's not happy and the girls just 30,

3118
02:06:50,131 --> 02:06:51,570
40 pounds overweight.
He likes it.

3119
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:55,190
He likes some gigli and barely hanging 
onto their clothes for whatever reason.

3120
02:06:55,220 --> 02:06:58,770
Turns him on and he's a skinny guy to 
sustain.

3121
02:06:59,230 --> 02:06:59,850
Hmm.
Hmm.

3122
02:07:00,180 --> 02:07:03,860
I think it's a smell that they give off 
some certain people just like fuck,

3123
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:06,990
like food,
right?

3124
02:07:08,210 --> 02:07:13,210
Like pheromones.
Second difference between sweaty butt 

3125
02:07:13,210 --> 02:07:16,110
and thigh and mixed with old hamburgers 
that turns people on.

3126
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:16,820
Yeah.
Maybe it's someone.

3127
02:07:16,830 --> 02:07:17,760
I think it is.
Honestly,

3128
02:07:17,761 --> 02:07:19,440
I think it's your first sexual 
experience.

3129
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:24,470
You know,
you have like a really hot sexual 

3130
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:26,091
experience with a fat girl and you beat 
your brain becomes imprinted to 

3131
02:07:26,091 --> 02:07:29,841
sexuality.
Being attract people is kind of 

3132
02:07:29,841 --> 02:07:30,630
interesting.
That means I would like brown hair,

3133
02:07:30,631 --> 02:07:35,070
girls with big boobs,
brown haired girls with big boobs.

3134
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:36,220
That was your first.
Yeah.

3135
02:07:36,710 --> 02:07:39,910
Tell us more about you.
Do you get that?

3136
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:42,370
Do you have like a specific type?
No,

3137
02:07:42,371 --> 02:07:43,570
I don't.
Not at all.

3138
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:46,690
Not at all.
I'm not crazy.

3139
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:49,120
Pretty much just what I live for 
nowadays.

3140
02:07:49,210 --> 02:07:51,520
Not crazy and not crazy.
Yeah.

3141
02:07:52,630 --> 02:07:54,580
What percentage of girls that you dated 
had been crazy?

3142
02:07:54,610 --> 02:07:55,950
Most of them.
90?

3143
02:07:55,990 --> 02:07:56,710
Yeah.
Hmm.

3144
02:07:57,160 --> 02:07:57,580
Interesting.

3145
02:07:58,830 --> 02:08:00,600
Do you think girls are crazy,
allison,

3146
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:01,130
you,
you,

3147
02:08:01,131 --> 02:08:02,820
you,
you're around a lot of chicks.

3148
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:07,850
Do you think the majority of your 
friends are to blame and that they are 

3149
02:08:07,850 --> 02:08:07,850
like the crazy person.

3150
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:10,150
They'll be like,
oh,

3151
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:15,210
so I have an issue with my boyfriend,
but I think I'm just not going to tell 

3152
02:08:15,210 --> 02:08:16,600
him and see if it will go away without 
me telling them,

3153
02:08:16,601 --> 02:08:18,100
but I'm going to act mad and him next 
time I see him,

3154
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:19,540
I'm like,
why would you do that?

3155
02:08:19,541 --> 02:08:21,970
Here's a question.
When you're around a bunch of people and

3156
02:08:21,971 --> 02:08:26,971
you keep having relationships like this 
over and over and over again where you 

3157
02:08:26,971 --> 02:08:26,971
would crazy people,
you have all these problems.

3158
02:08:26,971 --> 02:08:31,830
How do you stop that?
How do you reset and how do you somehow 

3159
02:08:31,830 --> 02:08:33,880
another move forward without all this 
bullshit in your life?

3160
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:34,480
How do you do that?

3161
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:36,650
Um,
I try to like most,

3162
02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:41,680
most of my crazy ass bitches.
I tried to remain friends with them and 

3163
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:42,440
have some kind of cool level with them 
where I,

3164
02:08:42,441 --> 02:08:47,441
uh,
it makes yourself kind of healed that 

3165
02:08:47,441 --> 02:08:47,441
way to think,
okay,

3166
02:08:47,441 --> 02:08:50,921
this person is fucking crazy back.
It's still be friends with this crazy 

3167
02:08:50,921 --> 02:08:50,921
bitch,
you know?

3168
02:08:50,921 --> 02:08:50,921
Right.
But I'm saying,

3169
02:08:50,921 --> 02:08:53,750
how do you move forward in your own life
and stop this from happening.

3170
02:08:53,990 --> 02:08:56,230
Stop this pattern from a peanut.
How do I stop data?

3171
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:59,780
crazy bitches become gay.
Obviously starts sucking dick.

3172
02:08:59,810 --> 02:09:01,760
Ll cool j looked me up.
Where you at?

3173
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:03,260
Where you at?
Girl?

3174
02:09:03,950 --> 02:09:06,080
That was a sad,
sad answer.

3175
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:08,890
I think the answer is you don't have an 
answer right now.

3176
02:09:08,891 --> 02:09:09,270
No,
I don't.

3177
02:09:09,271 --> 02:09:10,520
I really don't have an answer.
I mean,

3178
02:09:10,521 --> 02:09:14,180
how do you have an answer for that?
I mean look at allison psycho.

3179
02:09:14,190 --> 02:09:16,220
Make eyes over there and she's about to 
snap.

3180
02:09:16,221 --> 02:09:18,860
look at her.
Are you about to snap some of those,

3181
02:09:19,070 --> 02:09:19,740
those,
uh,

3182
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:21,830
uncomfortable moments and the drunk 
cast,

3183
02:09:21,831 --> 02:09:24,680
especially the first one when you guys 
were hanging on each other.

3184
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:25,430
I'm like,
wow,

3185
02:09:25,580 --> 02:09:27,020
do you really want this out there?
Man?

3186
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:29,900
Why?
Because you're so silly.

3187
02:09:30,830 --> 02:09:32,270
It's just like,
it felt like dirty.

3188
02:09:32,270 --> 02:09:32,750
I was like,
oh,

3189
02:09:32,751 --> 02:09:37,751
it's like a lawyer lawyer,
but like I was watching two people in a 

3190
02:09:38,211 --> 02:09:43,211
living room hanging out and they were 
drunk and they were being silly 

3191
02:09:43,211 --> 02:09:43,220
together.
Like I felt like I shouldn't be here.

3192
02:09:44,090 --> 02:09:44,980
That's great.
Well,

3193
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:46,910
did you have pants on?
No,

3194
02:09:47,030 --> 02:09:52,030
I never have pants on.
That's probably what their main reason 

3195
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:52,030
why you shouldn't be watching us walk 
around naked,

3196
02:09:52,170 --> 02:09:52,760
man,
bro.

3197
02:09:52,820 --> 02:09:54,860
I don't want to close friends.
I grew up with.

3198
02:09:54,861 --> 02:09:59,861
I've known him since we were like 10.
He says he was watching it and he's 

3199
02:09:59,861 --> 02:09:59,861
like,
honestly,

3200
02:09:59,861 --> 02:10:01,380
I got like kind of uncomfortable feeling
as I was watching it.

3201
02:10:01,381 --> 02:10:02,570
Yeah.
a lot of people actually said this,

3202
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:04,250
you know why?
Because he wants to fuck you.

3203
02:10:04,251 --> 02:10:06,340
That's what's up.
What I mean dude,

3204
02:10:06,610 --> 02:10:07,490
that dude.
Yeah.

3205
02:10:08,110 --> 02:10:12,100
He got uncomfortable and nobody got 
uncomfortable because it's just.

3206
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:15,200
Some guy was when I was younger and she 
don't know.

3207
02:10:15,860 --> 02:10:17,630
You don't know me.
I'm just like,

3208
02:10:17,631 --> 02:10:19,460
I thought you were gay.
You thought he was gay.

3209
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:23,000
I'd say when we were kids and he has a 
girlfriend,

3210
02:10:23,001 --> 02:10:24,260
but he does have a thing for you.
Huh?

3211
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:28,850
And he said it once and get the fuck out
of my room.

3212
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:30,560
Oh really?
What happened?

3213
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:34,040
I'm all high and I'm trying to go to bed
and he was living me and he comes

3214
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,810
from my elbow.
Here's your roommate?

3215
02:10:35,870 --> 02:10:37,300
Yeah,
because his parents got kicked out.

3216
02:10:37,710 --> 02:10:39,750
Do you ever find like loads in your 
shoes or anything?

3217
02:10:39,751 --> 02:10:39,850
Like,

3218
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:43,470
is that what it was?
Know?

3219
02:10:43,480 --> 02:10:45,340
He comes in my room and he's like,
hey allison,

3220
02:10:45,341 --> 02:10:47,530
sit in my little chair like this next to
my bed and I'm like,

3221
02:10:47,531 --> 02:10:48,640
hey,
what's going on?

3222
02:10:49,090 --> 02:10:51,970
And he's like,
so been thinking like if we weren't such

3223
02:10:51,971 --> 02:10:54,370
good friends I would fuck you.
And I was like,

3224
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:56,610
get tHe fuck out of my room.
Yeah.

3225
02:10:57,340 --> 02:10:58,720
and that's it.
We never brought it back up.

3226
02:10:58,721 --> 02:11:00,460
I brought it back up like couple of 
weeks later and I was like,

3227
02:11:00,461 --> 02:11:01,810
you want to fuck me?
And then he's like,

3228
02:11:01,811 --> 02:11:02,380
no,
I don't.

3229
02:11:04,050 --> 02:11:06,520
Making fun of them saying,
oh,

3230
02:11:06,790 --> 02:11:09,190
what a friend.
A confidence booster.

3231
02:11:09,250 --> 02:11:14,250
Awesome.
having prejudice and jump out of a 

3232
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:15,040
fucking window and I'll never get it.
Well,

3233
02:11:15,041 --> 02:11:16,360
you know,
how old was he at the time?

3234
02:11:16,690 --> 02:11:18,070
Uh,
we were 19.

3235
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:21,700
You don't know what the last year.
Eighteen months.

3236
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:26,740
Two years ago and many months.
Months.

3237
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:29,320
Two and a half years.
Seventeen hundred days.

3238
02:11:29,890 --> 02:11:30,790
Not that much.
Really.

3239
02:11:30,820 --> 02:11:32,410
When you think about it,
two and a half years ago,

3240
02:11:32,411 --> 02:11:35,170
you were the same guy when you were like
22 though.

3241
02:11:35,230 --> 02:11:37,660
It's just fucking world.
If you knew me in 22,

3242
02:11:37,661 --> 02:11:39,850
you'd be so scared of me or two and a 
half years before that,

3243
02:11:39,851 --> 02:11:41,110
right?
Yeah,

3244
02:11:41,740 --> 02:11:46,740
we crazy back then.
And I was crazier and I was a hippie 

3245
02:11:46,740 --> 02:11:51,361
probably just because I was fucked up.
You were talking about earlier we were 

3246
02:11:51,361 --> 02:11:51,361
talking about,
um,

3247
02:11:51,361 --> 02:11:55,980
jersey shore.
Like could you imagine if you had a 

3248
02:11:55,980 --> 02:11:56,960
video cameras folloWing you around back 
when you were at that stage?

3249
02:11:56,970 --> 02:11:58,150
You know,
you'd come off.

3250
02:11:58,151 --> 02:11:59,800
So douchey.
Yeah.

3251
02:11:59,830 --> 02:12:00,640
Oh my god.

3252
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:02,990
Gross.
Even when I was 18,

3253
02:12:02,991 --> 02:12:07,991
I used to think I was invincible.
I wanted that whole stage where I'm 

3254
02:12:07,991 --> 02:12:07,991
like,
yeah,

3255
02:12:07,991 --> 02:12:08,830
I don't even wear my seatbelt.
All that other bullshit.

3256
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:10,610
You don't want to get a motorcycle.
Yeah.

3257
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:12,620
And then you get out of that stage and 
you're like,

3258
02:12:12,621 --> 02:12:14,390
what was I doing?
He never been hurt before.

3259
02:12:14,510 --> 02:12:15,170
I have,

3260
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:17,270
I got it.
I heard a bunch of times as a kid,

3261
02:12:17,271 --> 02:12:20,140
so I never had that feeling.
I broke my arm when I was six.

3262
02:12:20,141 --> 02:12:23,810
I snap like snap my forearm and to where
it was like hanging off,

3263
02:12:23,811 --> 02:12:28,811
it was fucking creepy and there was like
a big dent in the middle of my forearm 

3264
02:12:28,811 --> 02:12:29,380
and my hand was like the wrong,
you know,

3265
02:12:29,710 --> 02:12:31,950
it was hanging like folded,
traumatizing.

3266
02:12:31,951 --> 02:12:33,740
That was really bad.
It was a bad break.

3267
02:12:33,741 --> 02:12:38,741
Yeah.
They didn't have to go play tennis 

3268
02:12:38,741 --> 02:12:38,741
though.
They just set it somehow or another.

3269
02:12:38,741 --> 02:12:38,870
You should hear this car accident.
She was in man.

3270
02:12:38,950 --> 02:12:43,950
Really fucking want to talk about that?
About her boYfriend and her wearing a 

3271
02:12:43,950 --> 02:12:44,980
tie.
How old were you?

3272
02:12:45,480 --> 02:12:49,480
I waS 15.
Seatbelt or no seat belt and that was in

3273
02:12:49,481 --> 02:12:51,370
the back seat.
Got my best friend,

3274
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:53,050
the girl who actually said I wasn't a 
woman of god.

3275
02:12:53,170 --> 02:12:56,080
She went crazy from this.
What happened real in front of this from

3276
02:12:56,081 --> 02:12:56,710
this accident?

3277
02:12:56,780 --> 02:13:01,780
Well,
you could have included that when you 

3278
02:13:01,780 --> 02:13:01,780
were telling us how she was.
No,

3279
02:13:01,780 --> 02:13:01,780
it's

3280
02:13:01,780 --> 02:13:04,890
good because I can relate it.
So she's sitting on my right or 

3281
02:13:04,890 --> 02:13:04,890
whatever.
My left,

3282
02:13:04,890 --> 02:13:09,060
my boyfriend at the time is on my right.
There's a guy driving and we're going 

3283
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:10,420
down the road and we're going to go to a
haunted house.

3284
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:13,660
So he makes like a u turn and winds up 
hydroplaning.

3285
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:16,680
And we hit a tree going like 55 miles an
hour.

3286
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:21,920
Oh.
And I wake up covered in blood and 

3287
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:22,930
everyone had to pretty much get cut out 
of the car.

3288
02:13:22,990 --> 02:13:26,260
And my boyfriend was pronounced dead,
but he lived,

3289
02:13:26,261 --> 02:13:28,750
but it was in a coma for two months.
They had brain surgery.

3290
02:13:28,751 --> 02:13:32,890
All because my cheekbone hit his temple 
and it slipped,

3291
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:37,900
severed an artery and his brain got 
pushed over to the side and the other 

3292
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:38,960
kid was pronounced dead but lived.
But he's like kind of brain damaged.

3293
02:13:38,961 --> 02:13:39,900
He's okay now though.

3294
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:45,620
And then uh,
my best friend who obviously was okay 

3295
02:13:45,620 --> 02:13:49,160
next to me,
but she got a concussion and after that 

3296
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:49,160
she was like,
I'm a woman of god.

3297
02:13:49,310 --> 02:13:50,140
So I,
yeah,

3298
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:51,150
the next day,
um,

3299
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:53,220
I'm in the hospital and the guy comes in
and he goes,

3300
02:13:53,230 --> 02:13:55,320
alice and I want to be here if it wasn't
bad news,

3301
02:13:55,770 --> 02:13:57,990
but one of the guys aren't gonna make it
through the night.

3302
02:13:58,060 --> 02:13:59,040
And I was like,
oh great.

3303
02:13:59,090 --> 02:14:03,210
And it was my boyfriend and I is um,
like 11th month anniversary that day.

3304
02:14:03,211 --> 02:14:08,211
So it was like really fucked up.
Then I go to the hospital finally to go 

3305
02:14:08,211 --> 02:14:11,361
see him and they are reading him his 
last rites because they were gonna loan 

3306
02:14:11,361 --> 02:14:12,480
is oregon's out.
Wow.

3307
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:15,830
But he lived and he was kinda like slow 
for awhile,

3308
02:14:16,370 --> 02:14:21,370
but now he's totally fine.
He's noT the same person before the 

3309
02:14:21,370 --> 02:14:22,800
accident,
but he had still a person have your face

3310
02:14:22,801 --> 02:14:27,801
on his face.
He has a big scar all the way to here 

3311
02:14:27,801 --> 02:14:29,310
and all because like my cheekbone was 
just like smash god.

3312
02:14:29,370 --> 02:14:30,180
Damn.
Yeah,

3313
02:14:30,181 --> 02:14:34,110
that was nuts.
But hydroplaning scary as fuck man.

3314
02:14:34,780 --> 02:14:37,300
shitty cars.
My first car was a 68,

3315
02:14:37,301 --> 02:14:37,750
four,
four,

3316
02:14:37,751 --> 02:14:38,900
two,
my wife now,

3317
02:14:38,901 --> 02:14:43,901
my first car,
my first car was a [inaudible] 73 

3318
02:14:43,901 --> 02:14:45,571
chevelle,
but my first car that was worth more 

3319
02:14:45,571 --> 02:14:45,571
than $10 was a 68,
four,

3320
02:14:45,571 --> 02:14:49,771
four,
two and is a old hot rod and it had a 

3321
02:14:49,771 --> 02:14:52,120
400 cubic inch engine that was like way 
too much power for a retard like me,

3322
02:14:52,121 --> 02:14:53,290
you know,
and I was like 16,

3323
02:14:53,291 --> 02:14:55,430
maybe 17 at the time.
And uh,

3324
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:57,880
I hydroplaned right in front of my 
school.

3325
02:14:58,150 --> 02:14:59,860
I just,
I had bald tires.

3326
02:14:59,861 --> 02:15:04,861
The tires just weren't that good and 
there was a lot of water on the ground 

3327
02:15:04,861 --> 02:15:06,490
and the car slid sideways and slammed 
into a fucking telephone pole and a tree

3328
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:09,260
broke the car in half.
Why haven't you?

3329
02:15:09,550 --> 02:15:11,110
Nothing.
Nothing was fine.

3330
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:14,140
And the crazy thing is that me and the 
two dudes I was driving with,

3331
02:15:14,141 --> 02:15:14,530
we're fun.

3332
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:16,510
We didn't,
we weren't going that fast.

3333
02:15:16,750 --> 02:15:19,150
It was just a shitty car,
just fucking old,

3334
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:20,280
you know?
And it,

3335
02:15:20,290 --> 02:15:20,830
it,
you know,

3336
02:15:20,831 --> 02:15:23,440
if you hit the tree like that with a new
car today,

3337
02:15:23,441 --> 02:15:26,650
it wouldn't do nearly as much damage.
But that car just broken half.

3338
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:29,770
It was just kind of old and the frame 
wasn't good I guess.

3339
02:15:29,860 --> 02:15:31,150
But I,
I had a pretty good.

3340
02:15:31,180 --> 02:15:33,880
I mean They hit a pretty decent,
but I wasn't even going that fast man.

3341
02:15:33,881 --> 02:15:36,130
It was just,
just those old cars,

3342
02:15:36,131 --> 02:15:37,660
they just,
you have no control of them.

3343
02:15:37,690 --> 02:15:38,890
They suck,
man.

3344
02:15:39,070 --> 02:15:42,430
The break sucked.
Oh remember how long it used to take?

3345
02:15:43,270 --> 02:15:44,580
Oh my god,
I had a,

3346
02:15:44,690 --> 02:15:47,910
a skylark and 1970 skylark.
And you'd,

3347
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:51,070
you'd have to like,
be really careful with the breaks.

3348
02:15:51,250 --> 02:15:56,250
You'd have to be really careful with 
stopping like stop way earlier than you 

3349
02:15:56,250 --> 02:15:56,250
think because you're like,
come on,

3350
02:15:56,250 --> 02:15:56,250
come on,
come on,

3351
02:15:56,250 --> 02:15:57,100
come on,
come on,

3352
02:15:57,150 --> 02:15:57,940
come on.
Come on.

3353
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:02,260
Like every time you stopped it was an 
ordeal.

3354
02:16:02,350 --> 02:16:04,300
You know,
you like have a new car today,

3355
02:16:04,301 --> 02:16:06,950
man with disc brakes.
Abs and cheerleaders.

3356
02:16:07,540 --> 02:16:10,620
yeah.
Technology rather than technology.

3357
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:15,900
Someday they're going to be making fun 
of people for driving around thinking 

3358
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:17,350
like you remember when people had to 
like get in their car and try places.

3359
02:16:17,351 --> 02:16:20,230
When people have to wake up and go 
outside to teleport,

3360
02:16:20,231 --> 02:16:25,231
bro,
you're going to be able to teleport you 

3361
02:16:25,231 --> 02:16:25,231
to be able to move

3362
02:16:25,231 --> 02:16:25,231
like the mailman.
When is that going to go out of business

3363
02:16:25,231 --> 02:16:26,170
very soon.
That's fine.

3364
02:16:26,171 --> 02:16:26,730
Five years.

3365
02:16:26,730 --> 02:16:28,040
I would say.
I still send things,

3366
02:16:28,050 --> 02:16:29,980
bought things and get things ordered by 
mail and

3367
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,340
send.
I have to send checks in and stuff.

3368
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:35,010
It's going to be so upbeat like 
unpractical soon.

3369
02:16:35,050 --> 02:16:37,180
Well,
the problem is when you have no paper,

3370
02:16:37,390 --> 02:16:38,560
you have no fucking.
You know,

3371
02:16:38,561 --> 02:16:40,330
it's like things are getting weirder and
weirder.

3372
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:43,000
At one point in time,
money used to represent gold,

3373
02:16:43,001 --> 02:16:48,001
right?
it used to represent your $100 bills 

3374
02:16:48,001 --> 02:16:48,001
worth $100 worth of gold.
well,

3375
02:16:48,001 --> 02:16:50,110
it doesn't really mean that anymore.
now it's like it's just,

3376
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:53,410
you just have confidence that this $100 
is worth $100.

3377
02:16:53,710 --> 02:16:56,380
And what happens if a zoologist numbers 
I'll give.

3378
02:16:56,381 --> 02:16:58,350
you don't even have paper.
You just look.

3379
02:16:58,410 --> 02:17:00,440
You're constantly looking at computer 
screens.

3380
02:17:00,441 --> 02:17:05,441
Those screens are telling you what your 
numbers are and where are these numbers 

3381
02:17:05,441 --> 02:17:05,441
located?
Are they somewhere,

3382
02:17:05,441 --> 02:17:07,080
are they even fucking real?
And then the,

3383
02:17:07,110 --> 02:17:07,630
the,
the,

3384
02:17:07,631 --> 02:17:12,631
the economy becomes so transparent and 
so elusive and then it becomes too 

3385
02:17:12,631 --> 02:17:12,820
fucking strange.

3386
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:14,110
You know,
I think we need,

3387
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:16,390
we need some physical form,
we need money,

3388
02:17:16,391 --> 02:17:19,090
you need paper money.
We still need that shit.

3389
02:17:19,091 --> 02:17:24,091
We need something to just cling us to 
the idea that that money is a real 

3390
02:17:24,091 --> 02:17:24,740
thing,
you know,

3391
02:17:24,741 --> 02:17:29,741
when it all just becomes zeros and ones 
and zeros and then just people just 

3392
02:17:29,741 --> 02:17:32,701
start jacking each other for the ones 
and zeros and adding ones and zeros 

3393
02:17:32,701 --> 02:17:33,460
where they don't belong and it's 
fucking,

3394
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:38,580
it's not good man.
It's like all the shit that's going 

3395
02:17:38,580 --> 02:17:41,431
down,
all the money that goes to Iraq and 

3396
02:17:41,431 --> 02:17:41,431
Afghanistan and how much of it's 
missing?

3397
02:17:41,431 --> 02:17:43,120
Like all that.
The halliburton scams and scandals.

3398
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:46,660
Fucking billions.
Billions of dollars missing.

3399
02:17:46,690 --> 02:17:47,890
Yeah.
They don't know where it is.

3400
02:17:48,410 --> 02:17:49,990
They'll find it.
Did something.

3401
02:17:50,290 --> 02:17:51,180
Then lately,
uh,

3402
02:17:51,220 --> 02:17:51,700
the,
uh,

3403
02:17:51,701 --> 02:17:54,790
the youtube banos organization,
red,

3404
02:17:54,850 --> 02:17:59,850
do you know about all this?
It's supposed to be for aids in africa 

3405
02:17:59,850 --> 02:18:02,830
or 66 percent of the money stolen.
They don't know where the fucking wet 

3406
02:18:02,830 --> 02:18:07,510
people were stealing from banos and a 
helping aids organization.

3407
02:18:07,550 --> 02:18:08,950
People just suck

3408
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:11,530
jesus dealings going on over there or 
around here.

3409
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:13,350
Question.
I don't think they've isolated it yet.

3410
02:18:14,490 --> 02:18:16,380
Could have easily been going on in 
africa.

3411
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:18,510
I mean,
how can you put it past africa,

3412
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:20,310
right?
one for you.

3413
02:18:20,370 --> 02:18:21,420
One for me.

3414
02:18:21,460 --> 02:18:24,030
A documentary of iberia.
How they had to get out of their cars.

3415
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:29,040
Like they heard that the guys had money.
So the guys who were filming it had to 

3416
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:29,040
get out.

3417
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:29,390
When you're talking about the vice guide
to Liberia,

3418
02:18:29,570 --> 02:18:34,570
we talk about that on the podcast almost
every week because it's so fucking 

3419
02:18:34,570 --> 02:18:35,390
crazy.
If you havE not seen it,

3420
02:18:35,391 --> 02:18:36,290
folks,
please get it.

3421
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:37,670
You said it's on netflix,
right?

3422
02:18:38,150 --> 02:18:39,110
Netflix.
Streaming.

3423
02:18:39,590 --> 02:18:40,950
Yeah.
Um,

3424
02:18:41,090 --> 02:18:45,230
how did we get into this conversation?
We're talking about project red.

3425
02:18:45,290 --> 02:18:45,800
Oh,
the,

3426
02:18:45,801 --> 02:18:46,640
the,
the scam.

3427
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:47,340
you know,
the,

3428
02:18:47,341 --> 02:18:50,030
the billions of dollars missing this 
youtube guy.

3429
02:18:50,480 --> 02:18:53,120
Banos fucking organization.
And then the halliburton shit.

3430
02:18:53,121 --> 02:18:55,790
How much money is missing there?
If halliburton was like one guy,

3431
02:18:56,180 --> 02:18:57,470
they would never be able to get away 
with that,

3432
02:18:57,690 --> 02:18:58,700
you know,
it was one person.

3433
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:01,010
it's like,
where's your missing billions?

3434
02:19:01,011 --> 02:19:03,830
Where is it?
Oh no,

3435
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:06,260
it's gone.
But becAuse of the corporation,

3436
02:19:06,650 --> 02:19:08,060
you know,
it's like you could,

3437
02:19:08,090 --> 02:19:13,090
you could be missing billions,
but the weIrd thing is they get to vote 

3438
02:19:13,090 --> 02:19:13,790
like a person,
like in these,

3439
02:19:13,910 --> 02:19:16,910
they get to use money like a person and 
make donations like a person,

3440
02:19:16,911 --> 02:19:21,911
like one of the most recent,
one of the most recent findings or 

3441
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:26,980
supreme court rulings was that 
corporations have the same rights as an 

3442
02:19:26,980 --> 02:19:27,020
individual so they could donate money.

3443
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:29,030
An individual can donate like whatever 
you want,

3444
02:19:29,300 --> 02:19:32,180
which is ridiculous.
So Vermont is a,

3445
02:19:32,181 --> 02:19:37,181
the first state to step up and deny that
Vermont is the first date and the 

3446
02:19:37,181 --> 02:19:40,631
recently announced that they are not 
going to allow corporations to behave as

3447
02:19:41,241 --> 02:19:46,241
a,
as a human being and that they're going 

3448
02:19:46,241 --> 02:19:46,241
to judge them in a different way.
so it's kind of interesting.

3449
02:19:46,241 --> 02:19:50,320
You know,
It's interesting that one state finally 

3450
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:50,320
has the balls to step up.
You know,

3451
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:55,001
Vermont has a weird state.
It's always been like real kind of 

3452
02:19:55,001 --> 02:19:55,001
hippie,
you know,

3453
02:19:55,001 --> 02:19:58,840
kinda like ben and jerry's grateful dead
fish and it's not that many people up 

3454
02:19:58,840 --> 02:19:58,840
there,
you know?

3455
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:00,290
Isn't that the way that bob dole,
god came from?

3456
02:20:00,310 --> 02:20:01,370
Not bob dole.
The other guy.

3457
02:20:01,730 --> 02:20:04,550
I'm the guy that got.
He was running for president and carry.

3458
02:20:04,630 --> 02:20:04,910
No,
no,

3459
02:20:04,911 --> 02:20:09,911
no.
The guy was running for president and 

3460
02:20:09,911 --> 02:20:10,700
then he screamed too much and they a 
fucking cunt.

3461
02:20:11,810 --> 02:20:12,680
You don't know his name

3462
02:20:14,050 --> 02:20:15,750
trying to search.
I'm like searching my brain.

3463
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:16,110
Nothing.

3464
02:20:16,660 --> 02:20:17,370
Uh,

3465
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:19,090
I don't remember his name.
God dammit.

3466
02:20:19,240 --> 02:20:22,600
He was a really articulate guy.
I'm sure someone on twitter will tell me

3467
02:20:22,601 --> 02:20:25,330
almost immediately he was a really 
articulate guy.

3468
02:20:25,540 --> 02:20:30,540
But uh,
for whatever reason he did this one 

3469
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:33,691
speech where a while he was doing a 
speech fucking homeboy started yelling 

3470
02:20:33,830 --> 02:20:35,480
just to like,
was just like,

3471
02:20:35,481 --> 02:20:36,750
he excited.
Then we're gonna,

3472
02:20:36,890 --> 02:20:41,890
you know,
then we're going to take over New York 

3473
02:20:41,890 --> 02:20:42,640
and I'm going to take over.
And it was like at a rally and he didn't

3474
02:20:42,641 --> 02:20:43,390
realize,
you know,

3475
02:20:43,391 --> 02:20:44,710
that the microphone,
you know,

3476
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:46,630
when you think you're screaming and 
yelling,

3477
02:20:46,810 --> 02:20:51,810
you know,
and you think that the sound of the 

3478
02:20:51,810 --> 02:20:53,371
crowd is like a,
you're at the same level of this out of 

3479
02:20:53,371 --> 02:20:53,371
the crowd.
So you can't even hear your own voIce.

3480
02:20:53,371 --> 02:20:54,670
Well the microphone right in front of 
his face.

3481
02:20:54,910 --> 02:20:58,180
So the microphone is only picking him up
so it sounded like extra.

3482
02:20:58,180 --> 02:21:00,580
Completely crazy.
Alright.

3483
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:02,500
Someone will tell me on the message 
board please,

3484
02:21:03,130 --> 02:21:08,020
because I know you fuckers know whose 
name is 66 percent of banos money.

3485
02:21:08,230 --> 02:21:09,790
Howard dean.
Thank you sir.

3486
02:21:09,791 --> 02:21:10,580
Mr.
Dennis.

3487
02:21:10,620 --> 02:21:12,850
And he came up with it.
That's the dude's name.

3488
02:21:12,851 --> 02:21:14,780
Howard dean.
I believe he was the um,

3489
02:21:14,810 --> 02:21:17,110
the governor of Vermont.
So it's a,

3490
02:21:17,111 --> 02:21:22,111
it's a freaky little fucking state.
But they stepped up and said the 

3491
02:21:22,111 --> 02:21:22,510
corporations aren't people you fuck 
heads.

3492
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:24,820
Will that help?
No,

3493
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:28,450
not unless you moved to Vermont.
Do want to move to Vermont?

3494
02:21:28,510 --> 02:21:29,260
No,
it's too cold.

3495
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:34,400
Vermont now my friend shane lived at 
night and there was points where it was 

3496
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:35,450
snowing so bad that he had to like drive
through tunnels.

3497
02:21:35,470 --> 02:21:36,070
just,
you know,

3498
02:21:36,071 --> 02:21:41,071
like they had done.
he was stuck at his house for weeks at 

3499
02:21:41,071 --> 02:21:41,071
times.
Oh yeah.

3500
02:21:41,071 --> 02:21:41,071
Oh yeah.
That's normal.

3501
02:21:41,071 --> 02:21:42,730
Fuck that.
vermont's no joke.

3502
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:45,400
You can't be traveling on the road as 
much as we do in live with romana.

3503
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:48,490
So that's out.
There was one other thing that I want to

3504
02:21:48,491 --> 02:21:51,400
talk about before we get out of here,
but I don't remember what it is.

3505
02:21:53,410 --> 02:21:55,240
Um,
got anything brian?

3506
02:21:55,530 --> 02:21:57,040
Um,

3507
02:21:57,180 --> 02:21:58,880
yeah.
And she goes here.

3508
02:21:58,920 --> 02:21:59,880
Yeah.
I think I already told you.

3509
02:21:59,940 --> 02:22:04,940
But flavor flave has a new chicken.
He selling chicken now and uh,

3510
02:22:06,250 --> 02:22:07,710
it's hilarious.
It's got flavor.

3511
02:22:07,711 --> 02:22:12,060
Flavor's fried chicken and it's in I 
believe Iowa.

3512
02:22:12,740 --> 02:22:17,740
And if you to google it,
google is search that and just look at 

3513
02:22:17,740 --> 02:22:20,410
the advertising for it to this one.
It doesn't even look like flavor flavor,

3514
02:22:20,750 --> 02:22:25,750
flavor.
Flavor is fried chicken mixed with 

3515
02:22:25,750 --> 02:22:28,640
chicken wings.
There's a lot people love chicken and 

3516
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:28,640
Iowa.

3517
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:31,100
Hilarious stuff.
Flavor flavor is one of those dudes just

3518
02:22:31,891 --> 02:22:33,640
always going to kind of be around.
Yeah.

3519
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:34,710
No.
Yeah,

3520
02:22:34,750 --> 02:22:36,090
mean you don't hear about chuck d 
anymore?

3521
02:22:36,150 --> 02:22:39,390
You never hear about professor griff.
You don't hear about other members?

3522
02:22:39,440 --> 02:22:41,520
Yeah.
You know terminator x,

3523
02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:43,330
terminator x bro.
I don't know.

3524
02:22:43,610 --> 02:22:45,060
I don't know.
But fLavor flave.

3525
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:47,460
Did you watch the flavor flavor show 
were uh,

3526
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:52,580
they were trying to get them a 
girlfriend and the one girl who shit on 

3527
02:22:52,580 --> 02:22:52,580
the stairs.
Yes.

3528
02:22:52,580 --> 02:22:53,210
That was so fucking.
I see that.

3529
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:54,250
I didn't say that.
But brian,

3530
02:22:54,590 --> 02:22:59,590
her what happened?
She passed out and she showed it on the 

3531
02:22:59,590 --> 02:23:00,600
stairs or something like that.
Something like that.

3532
02:23:01,220 --> 02:23:03,960
Another she shit and it wound up on 
stairs or she.

3533
02:23:04,070 --> 02:23:05,580
Yeah.
fuck was that.

3534
02:23:05,610 --> 02:23:07,340
I think she was walking up the stairs 
and shit.

3535
02:23:07,341 --> 02:23:10,480
Her pants fell out on thIs.
Did he keep her on the show?

3536
02:23:10,510 --> 02:23:11,040
Oh,
I don't know.

3537
02:23:11,041 --> 02:23:12,060
But I mean come on.
What?

3538
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:17,360
What kind of human is just shitting 
themselves around dropping logs out of 

3539
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:17,820
their parents.
I want to wish.

3540
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:21,410
Hope that's completely real to stone 
director.

3541
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:21,730
Like,
dude,

3542
02:23:21,740 --> 02:23:22,980
just put a little poop coming out.

3543
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:28,640
He had all the girls make chicken and 
see what make the best chicken and then 

3544
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:29,610
he this one lady surgeon and he's like,
are you serious?

3545
02:23:29,611 --> 02:23:31,860
Is this an even copd?
I can't believe you'd serve those.

3546
02:23:31,890 --> 02:23:32,790
Can you fucked it up?

3547
02:23:33,860 --> 02:23:35,150
well,
that's unfortunate.

3548
02:23:35,180 --> 02:23:40,180
Kicked her off.
Some people aren't that good at making 

3549
02:23:40,180 --> 02:23:42,671
chicken.
The reality shows don't have to make 

3550
02:23:42,671 --> 02:23:43,400
things up,
man.

3551
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:45,200
Those shows,
they don't have to.

3552
02:23:45,350 --> 02:23:46,610
You know,
shows like jersey shore.

3553
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:48,920
You don't have to.
There's enough craziness out there.

3554
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:50,690
Teen moms,
they don't have to.

3555
02:23:50,691 --> 02:23:51,560
You don't have to make something though.

3556
02:23:51,710 --> 02:23:56,710
That's like I auditioned for that ww ii 
divas thing and then I didn't really 

3557
02:23:56,710 --> 02:23:57,920
know what it was all about and she tells
me I did.

3558
02:23:58,040 --> 02:24:01,910
When was this last week in the house?
She was like,

3559
02:24:02,150 --> 02:24:02,960
oh,
it's a show.

3560
02:24:03,050 --> 02:24:08,050
Yeah,
I guess like you get in the house and 

3561
02:24:08,050 --> 02:24:09,791
then you do all these competitive type 
things where you battle for like a wwe 

3562
02:24:09,791 --> 02:24:11,030
diva where you do like interviews and 
fights sometimes.

3563
02:24:11,510 --> 02:24:13,610
The girl was like,
you're almost perfect for this spot,

3564
02:24:13,611 --> 02:24:13,860
dah,
dah,

3565
02:24:13,861 --> 02:24:14,480
dah.
And I was like,

3566
02:24:14,481 --> 02:24:15,950
sweet.
And then I was thinking about it and I'm

3567
02:24:15,951 --> 02:24:17,000
like,
oh,

3568
02:24:17,001 --> 02:24:18,810
it's going to be six weeks of filming 
and they're gonna.

3569
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:20,630
It's gonna be crazy.
Reality show.

3570
02:24:20,631 --> 02:24:22,810
Probably if it did work out.
Alright.

3571
02:24:22,910 --> 02:24:27,910
so what does that mean?
I would never want to be in a house for 

3572
02:24:27,910 --> 02:24:27,910
six weeks.
I would never do those reality show.

3573
02:24:27,910 --> 02:24:32,740
But when you're 22,
I liked taking opportunities that sound 

3574
02:24:32,740 --> 02:24:33,590
like kind of crazy.
so I actually would probably.

3575
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:35,900
So you're going to do it even be a pro 
wrestler.

3576
02:24:36,470 --> 02:24:41,470
You know what?
Some day when you're a big name pro 

3577
02:24:41,470 --> 02:24:43,121
wrestling,
you're on tv and you're battling will 

3578
02:24:43,121 --> 02:24:43,121
say we called it here first when you're 
like a,

3579
02:24:43,121 --> 02:24:45,290
like an interviewer and then you get 
drawn into the fight,

3580
02:24:45,500 --> 02:24:46,340
right?
That's what's going to happen.

3581
02:24:46,341 --> 02:24:47,020
Right?
So if they want.

3582
02:24:47,150 --> 02:24:49,220
Yeah,
I think it's a good move.

3583
02:24:49,590 --> 02:24:50,850
I would say do it.
I think it sounds fun.

3584
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:53,190
Flicks here.
My neck.

3585
02:24:53,430 --> 02:24:54,380
You know your,
your,

3586
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:57,480
how you can flex your time.
You will be able to see on the shirt.

3587
02:24:57,750 --> 02:24:59,820
Well you flex your boobs.
Pec muscles.

3588
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:00,440
Oh,
okay.

3589
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:02,700
That's creepy.
She just raises each one.

3590
02:25:02,701 --> 02:25:04,770
But she's getting you to work out with 
you guys were hanging out.

3591
02:25:05,130 --> 02:25:07,830
You're going to get a gym pass.
I can physically train you.

3592
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:10,350
She's a physical training.
Powerful alpha male.

3593
02:25:10,380 --> 02:25:11,290
Female.
Well,

3594
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:14,100
no I wouldn't.
We could just run together.

3595
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:14,580
No,

3596
02:25:15,020 --> 02:25:16,270
no,
not into it.

3597
02:25:16,271 --> 02:25:18,280
No.
You don't care about shape shit.

3598
02:25:18,340 --> 02:25:23,340
You're happy with your shape.
Fuck you're happy with your cigarettes 

3599
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:23,340
and everything.
You don't need to change.

3600
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:23,860
Change.
Don't change

3601
02:25:24,390 --> 02:25:25,450
west.
Probably just weekend.

3602
