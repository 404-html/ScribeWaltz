1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,300
Have you been here since he had a kid?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,780
Yeah,
I was here last,

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,120
right about four months after I didn't 
sleep at all.

4
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:08,954
It's amazing.
I was able to talk for and now your kid 

5
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:13,550
is how old?
Thirteen months.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,370
Wait till they start talking.
He.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,280
Oh,
he says,

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,113
I mean he's,
he's now his new thing is he says all 

9
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:22,730
done,
all done.

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,863
So he'll say it like he'll say it before
I change his diaper because he doesn't 

11
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:29,210
want me to go through that.
You know what I'm saying?

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,550
Hold on,
hold on.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,733
Don't say it like a lane his crib and 
say it like when he's ready to get out 

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,570
of bed early in the morning.
And I'm like waiting.

15
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:37,760
And I'm like maybe looking back to sleep

16
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,960
now being a scientist and having a 
child.

17
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,243
Are you,
are you like cognizant of like every 

18
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:51,140
single factor that's taking place like 
nutrition,

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,950
all the input,
emotional input environment must be kind

20
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,623
of mind blowing

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,340
and mind exhausting too.
Yes it is.

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,700
I'll give you an example right now 
because we're traveling,

23
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,430
right?
And um,

24
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,200
you know,
I,

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,840
I'm,
I'm pretty this the BPA plastic bottles,

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,273
you know,
I'm having to give him water and he's 

27
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:15,530
like obsessed for whatever reason.
He's obsessed with drinking.

28
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:17,240
I brought his like,
you know,

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,000
nice cop,
but he doesn't wanna drink it out of his

30
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:20,781
cup,
he wants to drink it,

31
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:21,614
all these plastic bottles.
It's novel and crinkly sound and 

32
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,210
anyways,
you know,

33
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,440
so I'm like all I can think about is the
VPA and you know,

34
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,703
am I,
am I exposing them to too much and 

35
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:33,980
what's it doing?
And is that BPA,

36
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:36,710
is it leach only when it gets hot,
is that how it works?

37
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,603
So.
And that's another thing I was thinking 

38
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:41,900
about in my hotel today,
making a coffee with one of those,

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,920
I'm one of those paper cups.

40
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,650
It has the plastic lining and like I 
don't know what's in the plastic lining,

41
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,513
bpa or some of the BPA alternatives,
which have also been shown to how does 

42
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:57,221
bpa stands for Bisphenol a.
So to answer your question,

43
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,990
there's been experiments done that have 
shown here.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,833
So boiling,
boiling water and putting it in plastic 

45
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:09,011
increases the BPA that leeches into the 
solution into the water by like 55 fold.

46
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,173
So yes,
definitely heating up it was like way 

47
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,174
worse.
And so one of the things I'm always now 

48
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,790
thinking about is,
you know,

49
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:17,624
going to starbucks,
whatever the plastic lining they're 

50
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:22,640
putting in those cups when you get your 
hot tea or your coffee.

51
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,273
I don't know if there's BPA,
but there's now studies that have come 

52
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:27,734
out in these studies have been done in 
animals that show like bps and some of 

53
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:31,784
the other bp of replacements also have 
negative consequences on the endocrine 

54
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:37,970
system,
on reproduction and some,

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
in some cases they're passed onto 
multiple generations now.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,070
How much of that is actually translates 
to humans?

57
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:45,920
It's unknown,
but there have been studies,

58
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:47,940
at least with Bpa that have shown that,
you know,

59
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:48,774
you give a person a single dose of BPA 
and it disrupts their insulin 

60
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,070
sensitivity.
It also plays a role in like I'm causing

61
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:58,154
problems with in vitro fertilization,
so disrupting hormones and things like 

62
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,254
that.
So I was really cognizant about it 

63
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,340
during pregnancy because,
you know,

64
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:11,341
typically we do detoxify,
detoxify it quite well.

65
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,660
The half life is like less than five 
hours and we excrete it through urine.

66
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,580
It also comes out through sweat by the 
way,

67
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:20,140
which is really good.
Um,

68
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,940
but pregnant,
but you know,

69
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,530
when you're pregnant for whatever 
reason,

70
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,300
the placenta,
it,

71
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,140
you know,
you,

72
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,340
you're basically take the BPA your body,
it's in your body and your,

73
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,360
your liver will inactivate it to this,
like more benign compound.

74
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,470
But when it crosses over the placenta,
it gets in,

75
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,320
it gets activated again.
And so it's like,

76
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,154
that's why they effects are much more 
robust always on like the developing 

77
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:44,530
fetus.
And so I was really made sure I was like

78
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:47,830
not drinking anything out of a plastic 
bottle or anything like that,

79
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:48,730
don't when I,
while I was pregnant,

80
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:49,810
just because,
I mean,

81
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:51,510
I don't know.
Right.

82
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,473
At the end of the day there's,
there's a lot of studies that have been 

83
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:55,750
done in animals and just how much of 
that,

84
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,760
you know,
translate how significant is.

85
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,760
It's really hard to say.
Um,

86
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,410
but it certainly concerned

87
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,090
it was probably a compounding effect,
right,

88
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:05,740
with all the other environmental 
factors,

89
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:07,840
pollution,
particulates in the air,

90
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,260
chemicals,
all the other jazz that we take into our

91
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:12,130
body all the time.

92
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,580
Right?
Yeah.

93
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,190
And then the fact that actually aging 
bottles,

94
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:17,900
like as you,
for whatever reason,

95
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:19,550
as a bottle sits,
like if you keep using,

96
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,950
for example,
the study was done with baby bottles,

97
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:22,784
if you keep using a baby bottle and 
putting liquid in as the bottle aged 

98
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,790
more BPA was leeched out into the 
liquid.

99
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,830
So for whatever,
I know it's just.

100
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,650
So it's another thing I'm thinking about
with all my son's stuff.

101
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:36,020
It's like everything's plastic and he's 
chewing on.

102
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:36,970
It's like,
you know,

103
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,620
at some point you just can't,
like there's,

104
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,240
you can't control everything.
Right.

105
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:44,000
How many kids do you think you're going 
to have right now?

106
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:44,834
Um,
one is,

107
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,763
it's,
I am so satisfied and full of so much 

108
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:50,750
joy and it's a lot of work.
Um,

109
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:51,291
and I,
you know,

110
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,340
he's 13 months,
so I've,

111
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,050
I've only had them a little bit over a 
year.

112
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,040
So right now I'm,
I'm really happy with him being special.

113
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,930
I don't know,
I think it's likely that maybe one,

114
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:04,370
but I'm not gonna like,
you know,

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,760
say for sure it's,
it's a lot of work.

116
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,810
It's a lot of work.
Yeah.

117
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,660
And you know,
it just adding another,

118
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:12,170
it's like,
well,

119
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,920
you know,
I've put a lot of energy and time,

120
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,793
you know,
spent a lot of time with him doing lots 

121
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:20,630
of things and of course all the 
nutrition and all that.

122
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:21,890
But um,
it's.

123
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,770
How do you do that with too.
It's,

124
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,300
it's very satisfying though.
Watching them play with their siblings.

125
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,820
It's really interesting.
Like my two youngest,

126
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:32,970
my eight and my 10,
like watching them play together,

127
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,853
it's,
it's adorable watching them hold hands 

128
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,100
and do stuff together.
That's really fun.

129
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,800
Again,
they developed a very unique bond.

130
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,100
They fight all the time over nothing 
like Gimme that it's mine.

131
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,410
It's my like in all of a sudden like,
whoa,

132
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:47,011
Whoa,
whoa.

133
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:48,540
What happened?
You know,

134
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,374
like there's always like some blow up 
because they have zero control of their 

135
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:53,640
emotions.
Anything that goes on,

136
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,250
it's just a flood gate is either on

137
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,640
or it's off and but they're really good 
at apologizing too,

138
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,620
which is really interesting.
We've taught them how to do that.

139
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,970
How to just say,
look,

140
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,950
everybody gets emotional.
It's okay,

141
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,670
apologize and hug it out and

142
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,663
yeah,
I think it's also another thing that is 

143
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,960
really important in the teaching or your
children how to be happy.

144
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,870
Like you know,
cause that's important.

145
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,150
They see that though they'll see that 
new,

146
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,310
you know,
the imitate their environment.

147
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,300
If they see,
you know,

148
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,423
that you know how to be happy and that 
you can turn things around and you not 

149
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:29,590
to make light of situations and they'll,
they'll,

150
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,720
they take on these behavior patterns.
Really,

151
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:34,480
that's one of the more fascinating 
things is watching kids go,

152
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:36,070
wow,
what are you going to do?

153
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,240
You know,
like when you do,

154
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:38,970
what are you going to do?
And then you see them go on,

155
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:40,150
Huh,
what are you going to do?

156
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,740
And you're like,
wow.

157
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,140
Watching an eight year old figured that 
out was kind of cool.

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,110
Yeah,
that's nice.

159
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:46,760
That's nice to know.
Like right now,

160
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:49,280
my son,
he's almost always just happy,

161
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:50,114
you know,
and I'm thinking about like future he's 

162
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,680
going to girl problems and girl breaks,
just anything,

163
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:58,760
you know,
where it's the thought,

164
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:00,110
well if he's gay.
Yeah.

165
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,250
And that's where I'm like,
you know,

166
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:06,100
all the endocrine disruptors.
Oh my God,

167
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,430
I'm gay.
Yeah.

168
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,450
Who knows,

169
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,030
who knows what's happening.
Yeah,

170
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,090
I mean,
and what's,

171
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,963
what's of major concern to me is living 
in a major metropolitan areas with the 

172
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,124
constant pollution.
And I was reading a study that was 

173
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:27,591
talking about living in any major 
metropolitan area like New York City can

174
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:31,080
take many years off of your life just 
from living there.

175
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:32,220
It will shorten your life.

176
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,783
Yeah.
I've been reading multiple studies over 

177
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:37,600
the years about air pollution and you 
know,

178
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:38,434
there's,
there's compounds in air pollution that 

179
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:40,594
are carcinogens like benzine and there's
also the particulate matter and how 

180
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:44,920
these,
you know,

181
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,980
how air pollution is,
um,

182
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,390
increasing the risk for stroke,
heart attack,

183
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,300
Alzheimer's disease.
Um,

184
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,173
and this is like in dose dependent 
manners and of course has all sorts of 

185
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:57,190
confounding factors and you can never 
really show causality,

186
00:07:57,191 --> 00:08:00,220
although some animal studies have been 
showing causality.

187
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,780
Um,
it's,

188
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,653
and,
and some of these things are really bad 

189
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:08,731
in developing nations that don't have a 
lot of regulatory regulations on,

190
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,911
um,
for example,

191
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:10,744
like automobile exhaust and so some,
some developing countries have like 

192
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,150
children coming down with strokes and 
stuff like early,

193
00:08:16,151 --> 00:08:18,910
like young teenage.
So,

194
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,803
um,
and it's been,

195
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,030
this has of course been linked to air 
pollution.

196
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,380
Uh,
so it's,

197
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,243
it's definitely a concern and then 
there's all sorts of studies talking 

198
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:27,574
about,
um,

199
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,470
you know,
of course asthma,

200
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,550
but you know,
happiness and,

201
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,910
and,
and bring function and all that,

202
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:35,230
you know,
so,

203
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:36,064
and it's something like I live off of a 
busy road and then there's noise 

204
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:40,060
pollution,
which is another.

205
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,133
I mean,
so it's like something that I've been 

206
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:44,404
like really,
really aware of and trying to like move 

207
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,910
out away from a busy traffic areas,
particularly for my son,

208
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,233
you know,
because I'm just very concerned about 

209
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,770
the health risks.

210
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,873
Yeah.
I wonder also the in the impact of just 

211
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:00,654
being in an urban environment and the 
fact that it's not really natural and 

212
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,584
that may be a person who's an adult 
could enjoy living in Manhattan and 

213
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,190
decide that they get a thrill out of 
living in the city,

214
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,024
but for a baby to grow up around all 
that concrete and glass and all these 

215
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,123
sharp hard edges and right angles that 
it's maybe not conducive to healthy 

216
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,710
brain development or that's not like 
what your,

217
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,903
what your body or your brain is 
naturally craving and there's been 

218
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:30,540
studies looking at,
for example,

219
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,374
like people that exercise and I 
metropolitan area versus like out in 

220
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:38,100
like a park nature and that,
you know,

221
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,230
all sorts of measurements of depressive 
symptoms that are measured after and the

222
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:46,350
ones that measured or that nature or 
run.

223
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,020
We're far better at,
you know,

224
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,630
basically feeling,
feeling happier after after their run.

225
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,280
Then the people that didn't,
metropolitan city.

226
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,260
Does that make sense?
No,

227
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,403
I mean I think that's why people like 
central park in New York City was just 

228
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,790
say in a way asis.
Yeah.

229
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,720
You get something.
I mean,

230
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:03,630
it's really a great place.
It's really quite big.

231
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,880
One of the things about central park 
when you're in it,

232
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:06,714
you're like,
wow,

233
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,790
this is weird that this is in the middle
of the city,

234
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,380
but it's a brilliant move to have this 
one area.

235
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,233
I mean,
you think about how much that real 

236
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:14,274
estate would be worth.
It just said just to shove buildings in 

237
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:17,184
there.
I mean Manhattan is one of the most 

238
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,034
pricey real estate places on the planet 
earth and yet in the middle of it they 

239
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:28,780
have this big open public park area that
anyone could just wander around,

240
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,190
sit by a tree.
It's really a very,

241
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:33,130
very smart move.
It is,

242
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,480
it is.

243
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,520
Nice.
La should have something like that.

244
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,773
Is the air pollution.
Do you know if the air pollution with 

245
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,840
like in Manhattan?
It's terrible,

246
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,860
terrible in Manhattan to La.
I think they're probably equally sucky,

247
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,190
but the thing that is bothering me,
um,

248
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,193
is not just the air pollution in terms 
of like the exhaust fumes and exhaust 

249
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,850
the smells,
but also the brake dust.

250
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,520
You know,
when I first started paying attention to

251
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:03,150
brake dust and I would always clean it 
off my wheels,

252
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,920
but I would never think about it like,
oh,

253
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:07,390
there's dust that's on my wheels.
I would say,

254
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,061
oh,
it's just dust.

255
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:08,894
And he was then someone was explaining 
to me to know that's an environmental 

256
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,220
hazard that you're breathing in.
If you live in that environment,

257
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:15,054
when you're around,
know if you're on Broadway and cars are 

258
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:18,960
constantly hitting their breaks around 
you.

259
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:23,130
There's a puff of that brake dust has 
getting in the air with every pump,

260
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,083
the brakes,
and you're just taking that disgusting 

261
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:27,840
stuff into your lungs.
Yeah.

262
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,713
That particulate matter,
that's really tiny and stuff because 

263
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,720
that's like Mesothelioma,
right?

264
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:36,050
You're taking in the particulate matter 
from his bestest.

265
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,840
So in the same you'd think there'd be 
similar mechanisms may not going to lead

266
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:41,010
to immediate family,
Oma,

267
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,420
but that there would be similar 
mechanisms at play that are like,

268
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,710
you know,
damaging organs.

269
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,020
Good to visit.
Not good to stay.

270
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,730
That's what I think.
I mean,

271
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,290
my.
I have no desire.

272
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,650
I don't even like living here.

273
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,500
I think there's too many people.
Yeah,

274
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:58,210
it's,
I definitely don't like driving here,

275
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,103
like it's like it's,
it's really bad how much is the 

276
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:03,910
difference between here and we're in San
Diego.

277
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,120
San Diego is definitely bad during um,
you know,

278
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,420
the typical times people are either 
going to work or coming,

279
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,070
coming home from work.
Uh,

280
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,790
but it's,
it's,

281
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,653
it's nothing like La.
I mean la is orders of magnitude worse 

282
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,440
for sure.
If you're not doing clinical research,

283
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,290
you could do a lot of your stuff 
somewhere else.

284
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,730
Have you thought about being somewhere 
else?

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,600
Um,
so my family's in San Diego and uh,

286
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,543
it's really nice having my mom in 
particular because she helps out a lot 

287
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,860
with my son so that I can,
uh,

288
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,520
get some work done too,
which is important and I really,

289
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,720
we could live,
you know,

290
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:42,610
a little bit further out.
I mean there's,

291
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,050
there are places like that are still 
within like 40 minute drive to like,

292
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,293
you know,
downtown San Diego beaches and stuff 

293
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:50,740
that are,
that are nice.

294
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,573
And um,
so that is something that we are 

295
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:56,050
considering buying.
We're just a little quieter,

296
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,300
definitely quieter no matter what it's 
going to be.

297
00:12:58,301 --> 00:12:59,470
You know,
because we live,

298
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,950
there's just,
it's a busy road and there's fire sirens

299
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:05,230
and you know,
my son likes the fire sirens,

300
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:06,064
but there are,
there have been times when there have 

301
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,860
been loud motorcycles and he is like,
concerned,

302
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,770
like you can see a look on it,
like it's,

303
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:12,670
you know,
so,

304
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,780
so it kind of worries me as well.
Um,

305
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,680
but definitely it's,
it's,

306
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:18,980
uh,
it's,

307
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,000
it's important to get away from that.
It's a goal for sure.

308
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,250
Now,
before the podcast started,

309
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:29,251
you were telling me that you wrote a 30 
page paper on the Carnivore Diet.

310
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,330
It's not a paper.
Well,

311
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,850
it's,
I definitely spent a lot of time pages.

312
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,420
I thought about it for a long time and 
yes,

313
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:40,660
there's 30 pages of thoughts and 
references.

314
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,340
Were you stunned that this became,
I mean,

315
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:45,060
this is a very recent thing.
Yeah.

316
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,920
People were just eating meat.
Well,

317
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,190
at first,
um,

318
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,430
when I was,
when I think Dan told me about it like a

319
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,380
couple of years ago even,
like,

320
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,430
and I thought there's no way.
I was like,

321
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,210
I just ignored it.
I don't have time for that.

322
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,210
So yeah,
I definitely,

323
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,890
um,
dismissed it when I,

324
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,813
when I first heard about it,
but it's definitely been something that 

325
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:16,070
has gained a lot of traction,
you know,

326
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,190
send it disturb you that it's getting 
traction.

327
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,380
Well,
I definitely have concerns.

328
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,840
Um,
I think that the,

329
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,990
the most important question really is 
what is attracting someone to try such a

330
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:33,730
very restrictive diet,
you know,

331
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,593
that potentially could be dangerous 
without published evidence or any sort 

332
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,510
of longterm studies and things like 
that.

333
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,820
So I think that the first question 
really is,

334
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:44,320
well,
why are people doing this?

335
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,640
And so looking on the Internet and try 
to like read about people's anecdotes.

336
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,883
Um,
it seems as though a lot of people are 

337
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:52,274
drawn to it because they have some sort 
of autoimmune problem and so they try 

338
00:14:56,751 --> 00:15:01,751
this diet and it improves their 
autoimmune symptoms and I see that seems

339
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:06,110
to be a real common theme in at least if
you,

340
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:08,240
if you look in the blogosphere ears and 
stuff like that.

341
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,920
Um,
so that's,

342
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,830
I think kind of a good place to start 
where it's like,

343
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:13,960
well,
you know,

344
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,370
what are people doing this for?
And then,

345
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,681
uh,
so that's,

346
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:20,810
that's kind of an important question and
I'm so,

347
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,870
so further reading about this diet is 
sort of sort of think about,

348
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:26,691
well,
okay,

349
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:30,190
well what's going on?
It's really important when you have like

350
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,333
something that leads to an effect to 
understand the mechanism because the 

351
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:38,060
mechanism is what's leading to this 
effect.

352
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,920
And so if you can do something that's 
potentially not so dangerous or risky,

353
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,620
then understanding the mechanism will 
help you because then you can find other

354
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:46,520
ways to do it.
Right?

355
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,893
And so,
um,

356
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,853
if you look at,
at a published studies on people that 

357
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:53,030
eat low carb,
high protein diets,

358
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,990
which is pretty common,
is that they're,

359
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,100
there's changes that happen in a variety
of different endocrine factors.

360
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,953
I'm like,
you know,

361
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,110
you're less insulin that's changing your
satiety and hunger hormones,

362
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:06,944
Leptin and Ghrelin and people become 
more satiated and they actually eat 

363
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:10,274
less.
And this has been shown in multiple 

364
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:16,070
studies so people actually eat less when
they're having a higher protein diet,

365
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,650
which makes sense to because protein is 
more satiating,

366
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,733
uh,
as well.

367
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,313
Um,
and also there's also been studies on 

368
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,440
what's called food habituation a,
we're basically,

369
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:30,170
so habituation is when you're constantly
exposed to the same stimulus,

370
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,004
you sort of have a decreased response to
that stimulus where there's been 

371
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:37,250
intervention trials where people are 
given the same food every single day,

372
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:41,900
both non obese and obese people versus 
people that are given the same food once

373
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,110
a week.

374
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,890
And the people that are given the same 
food every single day that they start to

375
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:48,800
eat less calories so they start to eat 
less.

376
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,620
I'm naturally started to calorie 
restrict themselves.

377
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,270
Um,
so I mean,

378
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,123
and that's,
it's Kinda like a dietary monotony sort 

379
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,500
of thing.
So I think there are any,

380
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,580
if you read and the people out there on 
the blogs talking about this diet,

381
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:04,070
they say I like I'm eating less,
I only eat twice a day.

382
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,430
I'm fasting.
So that's,

383
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,560
people are talking about that as well.
So I think there's published evidence to

384
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,630
kind of explain that.
And also there's,

385
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:12,740
you know,
people saying,

386
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:13,574
yeah,
I eat less.

387
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,133
So that's an important point because one
thing that's really known to affect 

388
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,130
autoimmunity is caloric restriction.
And fasting,

389
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,340
like it's probably one of the most well 
known,

390
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,283
um,
technologies that you can intervene and 

391
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:30,470
have improvements in autoimmune disease.

392
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,783
So,
um,

393
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,653
some of that has to do with the fact 
that you can sort of reset your immune 

394
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:37,160
system.
There have been animal studies and human

395
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:39,290
studies,
a lot of this done by Dr Valter Longo at

396
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,560
USC.
Uh,

397
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,570
he's done some prolonged fasting.
I'm in animals.

398
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:47,960
And also there's been sort of like a 
fasting mimicking diet done in humans,

399
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:52,230
which kind of a very low calorie diet.
This is meant to mimic fast.

400
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,780
Um,
and those have shown that,

401
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,533
um,
you basically kind of crossover because 

402
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:04,080
fasting is a type of stress you 
crossover into this like stronger stress

403
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:04,914
response where you're not only like 
cleaning away all the gunk in the size 

404
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:08,880
of the cells.
People talk about a topic,

405
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,500
you lot when they're talking about 
fasting,

406
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,130
you clean away things like damaged piece
of DNA,

407
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:15,690
protein aggregates,
things like that.

408
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,150
Mitochondria that are damaged get 
cleared out.

409
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,463
But you also sort of start to clear away
entire cells through a process called 

410
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:25,620
apoptosis.
And in animal studies,

411
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,600
what's been shown is that if you do,
for example,

412
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:28,434
a 72 hour fast,
you can clear away about 30 percent of 

413
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,660
the immune system and that and,
and,

414
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,553
and we replenish it with like brand new 
healthy immune cells and literally like 

415
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:39,054
Oregon's shrink once during the fasting 
and then they have like re-expand 

416
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,160
because you're activating the stem cells
and you're,

417
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,030
you're,
you know,

418
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,900
basically replenishing all your damaged 
old cells with new ones.

419
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,213
Um,
will voltaren as shown in animal 

420
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:52,980
studies.
Also,

421
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:53,814
auto immune cells tend to be selectively
killed off and replaced with non on 

422
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:01,770
immune cells.
So he's also done a clinical study,

423
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,653
a pilot clinical study with people with 
multiple sclerosis during this fast 

424
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:07,140
mimicking diet for one month,
sorry for one week.

425
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,350
And I'm there in their symptoms 
improved.

426
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,630
Also,
a ketogenic diet was done side by side.

427
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:15,000
And ketogenic Diet also improve symptoms
of autoimmunity.

428
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,210
So those both were done in humans.
So I think that,

429
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,530
um,
you know,

430
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:20,364
understanding that some of these 
mechanisms that are at play and that 

431
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:24,264
fasting itself and caloric restriction 
both have been shown to improve 

432
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:27,204
autoimmunity.
You may be tapping into something there 

433
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,720
by eating less.
That's one possibility.

434
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,850
Um,
in addition,

435
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,803
there's been studies,
clinical studies in humans were that 

436
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:36,314
were done.
They were basically fasted for 24 hours 

437
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:40,644
every other day for 15 days,
so they had like a total of seven days 

438
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:46,800
of fasting and these were also people 
with multiple sclerosis.

439
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,240
And there's profound changes in the 
microbiome that started happening.

440
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,580
And this was an in line with basically 
I'm having,

441
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,473
you know,
a lot of anti inflammatory cytokines 

442
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,933
basically producing immune cells that 
are really important for preventing 

443
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:05,610
autoimmunity called t regulatory cells.

444
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,580
So things like that.
So that's another really important thing

445
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:10,380
to consider is,
you know,

446
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:11,214
the microbiome because the microbiome 
has been linked to autoimmunity and 

447
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:16,590
multiple,
multiple studies.

448
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,360
I mean,
it's been linked to arthritis.

449
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:19,194
It's been linked to multiple sclerosis.
It's been linked to other diseases like 

450
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:23,340
Parkinson's,
which is not really autoimmune.

451
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:24,550
But,
um,

452
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,970
and the point of this is that,
you know,

453
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:28,950
again,
understanding mechanism and realizing,

454
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,263
you know,
there's other potential factors that 

455
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,630
could be leading to an effect,
right?

456
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,190
It's,
it's actually,

457
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:35,940
um,
the,

458
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,773
the changes in the microbiome are really
important because there's actually been 

459
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,820
a few animal studies which have led to 
phase one,

460
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:45,120
phase two and phase three clinical 
trials that have been done in humans.

461
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:45,954
So I'm cumins with multiple sclerosis.
We're treated with minocycline an 

462
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,374
antibiotic,
and they've been basically the 

463
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:52,714
antibiotic was shown to improve symptoms
of multiple sclerosis and because there 

464
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,410
there's good bacteria and bad bacteria 
that had been linked to autoimmunity and

465
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:01,940
getting rid of getting rid of bacteria,
you know,

466
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,230
the bad bacteria is going to probably 
lead to improvements and that's what was

467
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,550
shown in animal studies.

468
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,653
And then in human trials.
So humans I'm taking with multiple 

469
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:13,810
sclerosis,
taking motorcycling for two years.

470
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,033
So basically they had improvements that 
delay the onset or progression of the 

471
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,383
disease.
But then after two years those 

472
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:22,534
improvements went away probably because 
you're wiping out the microbiome and 

473
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,760
eventually you're also getting rid of 
the bad,

474
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,230
the good bacteria and so that things are
going to catch up.

475
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,670
Right?
So you're not just,

476
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,713
you may be getting rid of some of the 
pathogenic bad bacteria with 

477
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:34,444
antibiotics,
but eventually like you're also getting 

478
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:37,900
rid of good stuff.
So long term,

479
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,870
you know,
you may not have those same improvements

480
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,120
and that.
And that's very interesting.

481
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,930
I think it's really important point to 
understand,

482
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,243
um,
with,

483
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,133
with something like changes,
very profound changes in the microbiome 

484
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,050
when it comes to someone just eating 
meat.

485
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,443
So one thing to keep in mind with,
with the microbiome is that basically 

486
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,430
the bacteria really are good at adapting
to their environment.

487
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,070
That's why the antibiotic resistance is 
such a big deal.

488
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,680
And when you,
there's been human intervention studies,

489
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:12,460
when you take a human that goes from a 
high fiber diet to a low fiber,

490
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,473
high protein or vice versa,
you get changes in their gut microbiome 

491
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,383
that happened within 24 hours.
So within an hour you actually start to 

492
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:23,224
have doubling of populations of bacteria
and within 24 to 48 hours do you 

493
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:29,800
actually start to lose other.
So basically other bacteria start to die

494
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:32,350
off.
And this is at the species level,

495
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,243
it's really hard to change the Fila.
The Fila is more linked to longterm 

496
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,350
dietary patterns.
Eventually you can change as well.

497
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:39,560
But,
um,

498
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,460
it's been shown that people that go from
a,

499
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,733
um,
a more high fiber to a high protein 

500
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:44,944
diet,
they have changed their microbiome and 

501
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,243
these changes are a lot of the 
microbiome bacteria that are fermenting 

502
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,573
a variety of fermentable fibers start to
leave and you actually start to get 

503
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:58,900
bacteria cropping up that ferment amino 
acids.

504
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,970
So the amino acids,
amino acids,

505
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:04,060
simple sugars,
fats,

506
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:06,130
those are mostly absorbed in the small 
intestine,

507
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:08,830
but some of them make their way into the
large intestine.

508
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,680
And there's a whole,
you know,

509
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,520
group of bacteria called the 
putrifactive bacteria.

510
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:16,354
And they ferment amino acids.
And some of these species of 

511
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,510
putrifactive bacteria has been linked to
colon cancer.

512
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,630
There are much higher in colon cancer 
patients.

513
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,850
Animal studies have shown,
you know,

514
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,773
causal links where they can basically 
regressively cause a polyp to form a 

515
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,443
tumor.
And that's because these bacteria are 

516
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:39,420
making things called racine and 
cadaveric,

517
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,833
which are damaging their genotoxic 
agents that damaged the DNA inside your 

518
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:45,800
colon cells.
And so,

519
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,320
um,
people that are typically eating like an

520
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,183
omnivore type of vibe where they're 
eating protein and they're also eating 

521
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,393
fermentable fiber if they're eating the 
fermentable fiber that's facilitating 

522
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:57,740
the growth of lactic acid producing 
bacteria,

523
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,263
it,
that limits the growth of putrifactive 

524
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,290
be so if you're,
if your bifidobacteria,

525
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:06,650
lactobacillus,
s mutans as Thermophilus,

526
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:09,080
those strains of bacteria are elected 
acid producing bacteria,

527
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,120
which you'd be getting if you're,
I mean,

528
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:11,954
you,
you'd be facilitating the growth of if 

529
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:15,830
you're eating plants,
mental fermentable fiber,

530
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,173
you're going to limit the growth of 
putrifactive because they can't grow 

531
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:20,204
with lactic acid.

532
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,300
So it's not like,
it's not a huge,

533
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:24,134
huge concern.
But the question is what happens when 

534
00:24:26,451 --> 00:24:29,840
you're only eating when you're only 
getting immuno acids,

535
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,000
you know,
so is there a longterm?

536
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:32,930
So if you're,
if you're,

537
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,033
if you're killing off potentially some 
of this pathogenic bacteria and you're 

538
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,740
having this effect,
a positive effect,

539
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,590
what's going to happen long term?
It's not known.

540
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,401
I mean,
this data,

541
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:44,234
I mean,
it hasn't really been studied at that 

542
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:45,704
level,

543
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:46,883
been a few people that have,
have anecdotal stories about doing it 

544
00:24:50,101 --> 00:24:52,260
for 10,
20 years that are online,

545
00:24:52,261 --> 00:24:54,270
but it's very difficult to track,
you know,

546
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,800
I mean,
it's,

547
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,140
it's that you have take them at their 
word for it.

548
00:24:58,141 --> 00:25:00,480
They eat nothing but meat for 20 years 
and they feel amazing,

549
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,630
but there's not very many of them.
There's a,

550
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:03,970
there's a,
well,

551
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,990
there may be more out there,
but it's in terms of like what I've come

552
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:08,880
across articles,
um,

553
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,340
you know,
just a social media profiles,

554
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:13,200
people to talk about the positive 
benefits of it.

555
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,513
It seems to me that most people that are
talking about the positive benefits are 

556
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:19,500
talking about it within a one and two 
year window.

557
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,560
That's what we're really dealing with a 
lot of.

558
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,940
Um,
Sean Baker,

559
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:27,210
Dr Sean Baker who is probably the 
leading proponent of it,

560
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:28,044
or one of the poster boys of it,
along with Jordan Peterson and his 

561
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:32,040
daughter Mckayla,
a Jordan Peterson,

562
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:32,910
his daughter Mckayla.

563
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,230
They're different in that they were 
dealing with severe autoimmune issues.

564
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,280
Uh,
his daughters had two joints replaced,

565
00:25:41,281 --> 00:25:42,114
but before she was 18 she had her,
well she had her ankle replaced before 

566
00:25:46,081 --> 00:25:51,081
she was 18 and I think she had her hip 
replaced shortly after that and um,

567
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,493
Jordan has had some pretty severe 
autoimmune issues and depression within 

568
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,490
with both of them,
those things were cleared up,

569
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,190
but as you've talked about multiple 
times before on this show,

570
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,000
depression has been linked to disorders 
in the gut biome.

571
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,490
Right.
And this is something that you feel like

572
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:09,324
may be contributing to this as long as,
as well as both of them also got very 

573
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:14,760
lean.
Jordan lost a ton of weight.

574
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,833
He's back to the weight that he was when
he was 25 years old and I've eaten with 

575
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:22,380
him and the guy eats,
he eats a lot,

576
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,610
but it's a lot of meat just like he'll 
eat like a 30 ounce steak,

577
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,560
you know,
which is just crazy.

578
00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:31,110
It's a crazy amount of meat.
But,

579
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:31,944
um,
I don't know how many times he's doing 

580
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:33,900
that a day.
I don't know.

581
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,690
Yeah,
yeah,

582
00:26:35,691 --> 00:26:36,770
I think I,
you know,

583
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,070
going back to the,
the,

584
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,660
the point,
it's like there are other,

585
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,563
you understanding the mechanisms is and 
there's a lot of potential confounding 

586
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:46,170
factors,
right?

587
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,490
And that with any anecdotal data is 
extremely important to consider.

588
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:52,870
I mean,
people can't even neutral,

589
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,790
you know,
scientists,

590
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:57,570
nutritionists,
just people can't even agree on the best

591
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:58,404
diet because a lot of these 
epidemiological and observational 

592
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:02,814
studies which don't establish causation,
have an enormous amount of confounding 

593
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:10,530
factors and it is freaking,
it's so hard to like control for that.

594
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,663
I mean just as a perfect example,
we've talked about this before on the 

595
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:15,151
podcast,
but you know,

596
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:17,220
the vegetarian versus people that eat 
meat,

597
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,360
one of the really large studies that was
done and,

598
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,213
and,
and Dr Valter Longo was part of that 

599
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:22,674
study looked at all cause mortality and 
cancer mortality and it was lower and 

600
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:26,904
vegetarians,
but they decided to take the mediators 

601
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,101
and say,
okay,

602
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:30,660
what about within this group?

603
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,650
The people that are healthy meat eaters 
are people that are,

604
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:35,250
you know,
not,

605
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,630
you know,
not unhealthy.

606
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:38,360
So they're not obese.
They're not sedentary,

607
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,410
they're not smoking,
the not alcohol,

608
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,330
not excessively drinking alcohol.
Those people,

609
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:44,640
when they took out that,
those confounding factors,

610
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,330
the mediators had the same mortality as 
a vegetarian,

611
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,583
same cancer.
So confounding factors are so important 

612
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:54,810
and that with anything with anecdotal,
you have people that are exercising like

613
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:55,644
crazy.
Exercise is also been shown to change 

614
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,470
microbiome,
independent of diet,

615
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,743
um,
in a positive way where you're actually 

616
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:04,950
producing more of the bacteria that are 
producing things like lactic acid.

617
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,730
So in fasting does the same thing.
And so you have people that are fasting.

618
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:09,564
So,
you know,

619
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,100
it's not like you can't do other things 
if you're on that type of bed to,

620
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,800
to sort of help with the microbiome.
But I think again,

621
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,490
if there's a way you can do,
you know,

622
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:24,480
if there's a way that you can get these 
benefits without having to do something.

623
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,700
So hyperdub restrictive and we'll talk 
about.

624
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:27,960
I mean,
I have concerns for that.

625
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:30,400
We can definitely get into that.
But um,

626
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,670
then why not try that?
And you know,

627
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:33,840
the thing with like,
for example,

628
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,420
doing like a prolonged fast,
you know,

629
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:38,160
once,
once a quarter,

630
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,100
once every couple of months,
depending on how severe your your issues

631
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:42,270
are.
I mean there's,

632
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,180
there's been benefits shown with that,
like an aging,

633
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,073
like,
you know,

634
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,510
so people that have been put on this 
fasting mimicking diet,

635
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:51,320
they have improved biomarkers of aging.
Um,

636
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,190
they increase their lean muscle mass.
I mean,

637
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:55,950
so like I said,
an animal studies and you can't directly

638
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:56,784
translate the animal studies to humans 
because rodents have a really fast 

639
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:03,000
metabolism and if you fast them for 48 
hours,

640
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:03,834
they lose 20 percent of their body 
weight where humans only losing one or 

641
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:06,480
two percent.
I mean,

642
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:09,120
that's like clearly,
you know.

643
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

644
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,593
So you can't,
I mean obviously you can't completely 

645
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:16,320
translate everything that's done in a 
fascinating roden to humans.

646
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,830
But there are definitely organs are 
shrinking.

647
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:23,100
And then literally we growing after the 
fast is over.

648
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:25,740
Like it's like this rejuvenation 
process.

649
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,310
And it seems as though selectively 
damage cells are killed.

650
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,540
In fact,
this whole,

651
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,030
like there's a whole,
um,

652
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,960
Dr Valter Longo showing that cancer 
cells are really,

653
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:38,760
really susceptible to dying when 
they're,

654
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,220
when you do like a prolonged fast,
even a fasting mimicking diet,

655
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,430
and he's,
he's,

656
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,313
he's shown this an animal studies and 
you send a couple of clinical studies 

657
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,293
were,
were patients with cancer were treated 

658
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:50,614
with standard of care,
but before their standard of care 

659
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:54,880
treatment,
they were faster to for up to 72 hours.

660
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,153
And what happens,
what he shown in animal studies happens 

661
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:01,270
is that because the fasting is a type of
stress,

662
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:04,600
all your healthy cells increase all 
these stress response pathways.

663
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,433
They make more heat shock proteins.
They're increasing antioxidant 

664
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:09,200
production pathways,
antiinflammatory.

665
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,170
They're doing all this really good stuff
in response.

666
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,930
Cancer cells can't do that.
They're like screwed up.

667
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,910
And so they can't activate the stress 
response pathway.

668
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:17,744
So it ends up killing them.
So what you end up happening happening 

669
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,503
happening is that when you're giving 
another genotoxic stress like chemo or 

670
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:27,700
radiation,
your healthy cells become more resistant

671
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,380
to the damaging effects of the 
radiation.

672
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:31,570
And the cancer cells become more 
sensitized to the death.

673
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,560
And so what he's shown him in his pilot 
studies in humans is that basically,

674
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,810
um,
the humans that were,

675
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,823
that were,
that were treated with the standard of 

676
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:43,270
care,
I think it was chemo and also fasted,

677
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,900
they had less neutropenia,
which is the loss of like neutrophils,

678
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:49,640
which is the side effect because you're 
losing normal healthy cells.

679
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:52,720
So they had less of that happening,
less myelosuppression.

680
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,483
So I mean anyways,
the point is that I think if you can 

681
00:30:57,311 --> 00:31:00,650
find a way to get positive benefits,
you know,

682
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,990
without having to do something so risky 
and potentially dangerous and unstudied,

683
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,420
um,
you know,

684
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,573
in a unstudied in a really scientific 
way of controlling for contract 

685
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,570
compounding factors and all sorts of 
longterm.

686
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,520
I mean,
just all of that is really important.

687
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,723
Well then just comprehensive breakdown 
that you just did is something that's 

688
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,220
really lacking from a lot of discussion 
of this carnivore diet.

689
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,280
And from the proponents of it,
it's almost like a lot of them are going

690
00:31:27,831 --> 00:31:29,630
into it blindfolded.
They'll like,

691
00:31:29,631 --> 00:31:31,610
look,
it seems to be working.

692
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:35,570
So I'm just going to stick with it.
But again,

693
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,630
when you're talking about most people's 
cases,

694
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:41,150
you're talking about one year,
maybe two years,

695
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:41,984
sometimes even less,
where they're having these benefits and 

696
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,333
as you're saying,
it's entirely possible that they're 

697
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:51,650
setting themselves up for some potential
longterm damage.

698
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,730
It is.
Um,

699
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,020
it is definitely possible.
And again,

700
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:58,860
at the end of the day there's no data,
there's no data.

701
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:00,440
So you can say for sure,
right,

702
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,463
there's no data,
but I have concerns and we can talk 

703
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,040
about those concerns for sure.
I would like to.

704
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:09,140
But you know,
the thing is understanding mechanism,

705
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,470
like you said,
going in blindly.

706
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,600
I mean you have a hypothesis and it's 
like,

707
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:15,900
okay,
your hypothesis is all plants are bad.

708
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,760
That's what I keep hearing.
And it's like,

709
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,430
well that's a hypothesis,
but what about all the other things that

710
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:24,300
are potentially happening while you're 
doing this diet and you're fasting more,

711
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:27,120
your microbiomes changing dramatically 
changing.

712
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,103
And those things all have been known.
Multiple studies have shown that humans 

713
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:34,770
and animals mechanistic detail to have 
benefits on autoimmunity,

714
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,860
on aging in general,
on brain function.

715
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:39,500
I mean all sorts of things.
You know.

716
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:40,334
So it's mechanism is so important,
you have to realize that that's the 

717
00:32:44,151 --> 00:32:47,690
whole basis of science,
understanding how the world works around

718
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:49,250
you,
understanding how your body works,

719
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,730
mechanisms like you have hypothesis and 
it's very,

720
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:56,750
and I understand it's like someone 
experiences something positive.

721
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,030
It's like well this must be,
this is it,

722
00:32:59,031 --> 00:32:59,864
this is the end all be all and.
But you have to realize the shits 

723
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,903
complicated.
You got to understand the mechanism and 

724
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,020
you may be doing something a longterm 
that potentially.

725
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:14,750
I mean it really hasn't been studied.

726
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,783
Yes.
So.

727
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,833
Well that was one of the.
I mean I had Jordan's daughter Mckayla 

728
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:23,560
on who's had some pretty dramatic 
results from this carnivore diet,

729
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:28,480
but she's giving essentially nutrition 
consulting to people,

730
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,600
but she doesn't really have a background
in it and she's in.

731
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,150
She doesn't have the information that 
you just distributed,

732
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,330
like what you just said to all these 
people listening,

733
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,823
the way you're describing the,
the mechanisms and the benefits of 

734
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:43,900
fasting and all these different various 
things that are happening inside of your

735
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:44,734
gut and all these different things that 
are happening with healthy cells and 

736
00:33:47,381 --> 00:33:52,381
damaged cells with fasting and that this
is mimicked by this restrictive diet.

737
00:33:52,691 --> 00:33:55,510
And then this is all absent from the 
dialogue.

738
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,583
This is all absent from the dust and 
this is one of the things that's 

739
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,863
disturbing the most disturbing for me.
It's like I get that they're seeing 

740
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,030
positive results.

741
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:08,800
I cannot deny that they're receiving,
but when they start saying,

742
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,031
uh,
you know,

743
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:12,730
plants are bad and there's a,
you know,

744
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,953
like my friend Chris,
he's always talking about the war on 

745
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:16,070
carbs.
He's having real.

746
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,840
He's also got Chris Bell.
He's got autoimmune issues as well.

747
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,660
He's had both of his hips replaced 
before he was 35 and you know,

748
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,503
severe arthritis and he is leaner than 
he's ever been and benefiting greatly 

749
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:33,130
from this carnivore diet.
But you know,

750
00:34:33,131 --> 00:34:34,360
he's,
he's like,

751
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,780
he talks about,
he uses Hashtag war on carbs,

752
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,000
you know,
and he doesn't eat salad,

753
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:42,430
he won't eat greens.
I think Greens are bad for you.

754
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,873
And I'm like,
man,

755
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,813
I don't not sure that's correct.
I think it's so important what you're 

756
00:34:49,031 --> 00:34:49,920
saying.
And um,

757
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,800
there's a,
uh,

758
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,713
a researcher online that I've been in 
contact with names Kevin Bass and his 

759
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,700
bass or bass be ass,
not sure what,

760
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,553
how do you pronounce it?
But he also brought up this possibility 

761
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:03,124
that it could be a calorie restriction 
that these people are dealing with this 

762
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,403
essentially some of the same mechanisms 
that are the positive reactions from 

763
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:15,160
fasting that you're,
you're dealing with here.

764
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:17,830
And I'm very happy that you're saying 
the same thing.

765
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:18,721
Yeah,
I,

766
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:21,540
I think that is one very strong 
possibility.

767
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,440
And that is something,
you know,

768
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,580
there's lots of hypotheses here and you 
know,

769
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,653
given all the data and there's lots of 
positive data about eating plants as 

770
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:31,430
well,
you know.

771
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,700
So it's,
it's really hard.

772
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,163
That's one hypothesis and that seems to 
be the one everyone's sort of 

773
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,910
gravitating to.
Um,

774
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,340
you know,
if,

775
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,820
if someone's also wanting to reduce 
their,

776
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,640
their glycemic load and all that,
I mean there's,

777
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,533
there are other,
I mean eating just a modified Paleo 

778
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,563
Diet.
I mean I eat something like a modified 

779
00:35:49,051 --> 00:35:52,180
Paleo Diet where it's like I'm eating,
I'm eating fish and meat,

780
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,073
meat,
poultry and a lot of leafy Greens and 

781
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:56,934
cruciferous vegetables.
Now you can do and nuts or you can do a 

782
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:00,984
ketogenic diet.
Like they're like I just talked about 

783
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,683
the study that was done looking at the 
fasting mimicking diet and humans with 

784
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:09,210
multiple sclerosis,
sclerosis.

785
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,810
Um,
there was uh,

786
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,693
the same in publishing the same paper.
There was a study they study that put 

787
00:36:16,951 --> 00:36:17,784
patients on Ketogenic Diet for,
I believe it was three months and it 

788
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:23,190
improves symptoms of autoimmunity as 
well.

789
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,280
Was it comparable?
Yeah,

790
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,080
yeah.
Improvement.

791
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

792
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,950
Interesting.
So you know,

793
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:31,590
the key to genic die a modified 
ketogenic diet is also,

794
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,870
you know,
there's also concerns with that.

795
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,630
Not everyone responds very well and you 
know,

796
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:38,640
the micronutrient deficiencies have been
a concern,

797
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:41,570
but you can actually eat a lot of 
vegetables,

798
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,600
vegetables,
green,

799
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:44,440
a good ones that are,
that are low and glycaemic.

800
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,460
So my concern exactly,
my concerns are much,

801
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:48,620
much less,
um,

802
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,840
and it's been studied a lot more.
I mean,

803
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:51,683
at least there's been lifespan studies 
in animals on ketogenic diet where it's 

804
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:56,220
like improving,
you know,

805
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,530
the way they age,
it's improving their cognitive function,

806
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,750
brain aging,
extending their lifespan.

807
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,620
So,
you know,

808
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:06,621
if people are looking for,
in addition to wanting to like help with

809
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:09,000
their auto immunity issues,
you know,

810
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:09,960
there's also,
if it's like,

811
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:10,794
well,
I also just don't want to have a lot of 

812
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:12,744
insulin response.
I want to lower my glycemic levels and 

813
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:16,570
things like that.
Um,

814
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,833
it seems like a much better option than,
than doing something completely 

815
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:22,480
unstudied.
Right.

816
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,690
And so,
um,

817
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,083
you know,
I think that's a really good place to 

818
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:30,840
start and obviously not disregarding 
everyone's anecdotes.

819
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:33,090
And of course there's also the placebo 
and no cpl effect,

820
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:36,270
which are very real.
I mean extremely well real.

821
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,283
It's why a lot of drugs don't ever make 
it to market is because they can't beat 

822
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:41,730
placebo.
You know where it's like,

823
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,103
people think they're going to get a 
positive response from something they 

824
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:46,254
can write and the opposite is true.
People think they're going to get a 

825
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:50,070
negative response for something.

826
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,190
They can just got to be a way to market 
it.

827
00:37:53,191 --> 00:37:56,610
The placebo effect in a pill form.
I think it's great.

828
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,623
I think so,
and what's interesting is that genetics 

829
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,800
determines that there's snips.
Gene,

830
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,793
basically single nucleotide 
polymorphisms where changes in the 

831
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:08,130
sequence of DNA in a certain gene makes 
it function a little differently.

832
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,383
While the gene that's really important 
seems to be really important for either 

833
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:12,384
whether or not you're going to have a 
placebo versus no CBO isn't controls 

834
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,010
dopamine,
the degradation of dopamine,

835
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:17,844
so people that are really likely to 
placebo response have more dopamine in 

836
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:24,000
their brain.
It's called comp t,

837
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:24,834
the snip and the genes called comp t.
people that have less dopamine are more 

838
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:30,054
subject to the no cbo and this has been 
shown in dose dependent manner in 

839
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,230
intervention,
intervention trials,

840
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:38,470
randomized control in humans and not.
It's not a diet.

841
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,200
There's been studies on diet as well as 
showing like no CBO effects,

842
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:44,260
so people think they have a gluten 
sensitivity,

843
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:45,094
which I do think that's a real thing.
I mean I'm not saying non CELIAC gluten 

844
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:48,664
sensitivity.
I think there's enough evidence that 

845
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:51,580
showed that does exist.
However,

846
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,623
there was this great study that was 
published four years ago showing people 

847
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:57,580
that thought they were,
you know,

848
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,060
having gluten sensitivity issues.
They were,

849
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,210
they were randomized and none of them 
were given gluten,

850
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,133
but they didn't know that.
They thought maybe there's a chance I'm 

851
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:08,350
going to get the gluten.
I don't know I'm being randomized.

852
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,520
Of course they had a negative response.
They had distended bloating,

853
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:14,080
pain,
but there was no glue.

854
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,693
So the no cbo effect is also real and 
that's something to keep in mind as 

855
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:19,714
well.
If you think,

856
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,993
you know,
I'm going to have a bad response if I 

857
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,480
eat these plants,
you can fit there.

858
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,670
Yeah,
it's definitely,

859
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,060
it's definitely a real thing.
I think placebos much better.

860
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,480
I think that's a great,
like it's a great thing that,

861
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:36,430
that exists.
Especially if you could figure out a way

862
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:37,264
to trick yourself.
You're changing dopamine levels that 

863
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,360
affects your immune system.
I mean it affects a chiropractor who was

864
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:44,194
banking on that.
He was doing something called zone 

865
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:49,150
healing and the more I pressed him on 
this,

866
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,380
the more he basically said,
well,

867
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:52,270
if you believe that it works,
I'm like,

868
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:53,104
okay,
so you're saying that it doesn't work 

869
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,660
unless you tricked this person into 
believing that it works,

870
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:00,670
so you're a trickster is what you're 
doing.

871
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:02,500
He didn't want to go that far,
but that's essentially,

872
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,363
there's no real scientific basis to this
idea that you press on someone's back 

873
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:11,710
and fix the thyroid.
I absolutely think that placebo accounts

874
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:12,970
for a lot of that stuff.

875
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,260
Yeah.
And again,

876
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:15,610
Reiki,
all that shit,

877
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,380
all of it.
And I think that um,

878
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,350
the,
the,

879
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:22,540
the genetic snips involved really they 
do play a role.

880
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,390
Is there a diet that increases dopamine 
because there's.

881
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,323
You can increase serotonin with htp and 
to fan which converts to htp five htp 

882
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,103
what is.
Is there anything that ramps up your 

883
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:34,731
dope?
You know,

884
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:37,150
what does in the prefrontal cortex is 
fish oil.

885
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,980
In fact,
schizophrenia,

886
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,630
schizophrenia,
schizophrenia,

887
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:42,750
patients are prescribed a really high 
dose because they,

888
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,683
they lack,
they're doping means lower and the 

889
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,484
prefrontal Cortex,
and this is sort of associated with a 

890
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:50,230
lot of the negative paranoid,
delusional sort of.

891
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,120
When you say high dose,
what are you talking about?

892
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,740
Oh,
like six grand.

893
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,583
Three.
Anywhere between three to six grams a 

894
00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:57,340
day.
And what does a normal dose?

895
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,623
Well,
if you look at,

896
00:40:58,850 --> 00:40:59,683
if you're talking about normal in the 
sense where what's typically used in 

897
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:04,420
like a randomized controlled trial,
it's like one,

898
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,860
one,
one or two grams.

899
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,723
What is recommended?
People like Usta or what would you 

900
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:11,140
recommend?
Like there's no recommended nothing.

901
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,590
It's not now because because what's 
recommended is the.

902
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,290
So there's a plant version of it,
Alpha linoleic acid,

903
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,490
because you can convert that into the 
marina,

904
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,640
the marina omega three fatty acids,
Dha and EPA.

905
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,650
Uh,
that's the one that's recommended,

906
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,320
so it's like the,
what you essentially need,

907
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,243
right?
So,

908
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:34,130
so that's the one that's recommended,
but they were concern about

909
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,563
potential heavy metal poisonings when 
you're taking in fish oil or is that 

910
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:39,140
all,
all that stuff?

911
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,970
Do they know how to filter that stuff 
out?

912
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,450
It's definitely purified out and I mean 
it depends on the fish,

913
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,630
the fish while you're getting your,
your fish oil from.

914
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,650
But there's,
there's,

915
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,023
there's um,
international fish oil standards 

916
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,970
organization.
Uh,

917
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,740
there's a lot of different fish oil 
companies,

918
00:41:57,741 --> 00:42:00,120
um,
are tested by them and they show their,

919
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,700
all their arsenic,
mercury,

920
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,930
pcbs and dioxins,
like all those,

921
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,810
you know,
potentially harmful compounds.

922
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,003
And they also look at oxidized 
polyunsaturated fatty acids for the 

923
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:13,830
looking at total oxidation and things 
like that.

924
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:17,700
So that's a really good site to use to 
look at whether,

925
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,400
you know,
your fish oil brand is

926
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,583
years in the pill form or do you do like
Carlson's where you get in the bottle 

927
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:24,910
and take spoonfuls of it?

928
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,913
So I get mine in the pill form because I
have a friend that makes it in Norway 

929
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,790
and he sort of has convinced me that 
it's really good.

930
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,420
So I really liked his fish oil and he 
doesn't make it in the liquid form.

931
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,610
Um,
but I do.

932
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:39,444
So I take,
I take about like five or six grams a 

933
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:41,934
day.
I take a lot.

934
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,220
Wow.
Five or six grams.

935
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,083
Yeah.
And I'm taking like a high dose Dha 

936
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:47,424
because um,
it gets into breast milk and I haven't 

937
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:51,870
100 percent.
When did my son just yet?

938
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:54,380
How many pills is five or six grams?
Um,

939
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,530
it's like,
oh,

940
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,870
that I take.
So I'm taking six,

941
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,290
six pills.
The pills or grant?

942
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,153
Yeah.
Wow.

943
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,293
So,
um,

944
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,380
that is high dose.
It's really high dose.

945
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,420
It's really,
it's really good.

946
00:43:06,421 --> 00:43:06,991
Fisher.
It's not,

947
00:43:06,991 --> 00:43:07,500
he,
it,

948
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,960
he's working on getting it available in 
the United States.

949
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,263
Uh,
I think that's supposed to happen like 

950
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:13,870
in the next couple of months.
But um,

951
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:17,130
I used to take Carlson's Carlson's was a
bottle.

952
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,570
Yeah,
that's what I take.

953
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,070
Yeah.
Because you take a lot,

954
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:20,904
right?
Yeah.

955
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:21,810
So,
yeah.

956
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:24,180
But I'll take three tablespoons.
I thought that was a lot.

957
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:30,020
How much is in wondering idea?
We'll have to talk about my,

958
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,100
my Alzheimer's will make it three 
publication that we still have time.

959
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,480
Carnivores stuff.
Let's keep going.

960
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,373
I'll put that aside because I actually 
have a good friend whose dad has 

961
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:46,291
Alzheimer's and I sent her your clip 
from your instagram from yesterday.

962
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:49,743
Oh,
cool.

963
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,160
About that too.
Yes.

964
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:51,731
Yeah,
yeah,

965
00:43:51,731 --> 00:43:52,280
we will.

966
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,230
I'll send you my paper.
It was just accepted.

967
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:55,600
Um,
and uh,

968
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,920
it should be out online this month,
late sometime this month.

969
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,290
But um,
okay.

970
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,163
So,
okay.

971
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,870
My potential concerns with carnivore 
diet,

972
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,290
um,
you know,

973
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,110
I think,
I'm sure,

974
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:08,900
I mean I know this,
I've seen it all over the blogosphere,

975
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:09,530
is that,
you know,

976
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:12,180
the,
the micronutrients and you know,

977
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,360
they don't really matter.
They're rda is,

978
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:17,540
weren't set for carnivores and all this,
all this stuff that I've read.

979
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,880
But I think to start out like 
understanding,

980
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:20,714
you know,
micro nutrients are essential about 30 

981
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,380
vitamins and minerals that are really 
important.

982
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,930
They,
they do run our metabolism,

983
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:29,150
they are involved in making 
neurotransmitters.

984
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,920
They're involved in,
you know,

985
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,420
pulling calcium out of our arteries and 
Brittany tour bones,

986
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,403
they're involved in all sorts of things.
People when they hear the word 

987
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:38,460
metabolism,
they always just think about,

988
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,373
you know,
food you eat,

989
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:43,530
it's like metabolism refers to a lot of 
things.

990
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,500
And there's about 22,
I'm sorry,

991
00:44:45,501 --> 00:44:46,334
there's 22 percent of all your enzymes 
in your body require a micronutrient to 

992
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,180
function.
Um,

993
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,620
and this is repairing damage from Dna,
all sorts of things really important.

994
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:00,060
Um,
and so there's about 30 of them that are

995
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:02,100
essentially you have to get them for 
your diet because you don't make them in

996
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:04,470
your body and if you don't get them from
your diet,

997
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:07,590
it can lead to health problems and death
actually.

998
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:08,780
So,
so that's,

999
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:09,690
that's kind of,
you know,

1000
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:14,310
what micronutrients are Rda.
So recommended dietary allowance,

1001
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,710
um,
those have been set,

1002
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:21,540
a variety of different studies are used.
So there's randomized controlled trials,

1003
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:24,420
non randomized controlled trials,
there's depletion,

1004
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,460
depletion studies,
there's balance studies.

1005
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:28,440
Looking at how much,
how long,

1006
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,900
how much of a micronutrient it takes 
before you start reading it.

1007
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,223
Um,
there's cross sectional studies and 

1008
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:34,284
there's case studies and this is a 
collaboration between the United States 

1009
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:39,690
and Canada and some European countries 
as well.

1010
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,913
So a lot of experiments are done to,
to figure out the recommended dietary 

1011
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:47,520
allowance.
The first thing that's done is the,

1012
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,230
the estimated average wreck,
the s e a ear,

1013
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:54,260
the estimated average wreck,
um,

1014
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,373
intake.
So that is done by basically looking at 

1015
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:00,450
any population and going,
okay,

1016
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:02,400
how much of this micronutrient do we 
need?

1017
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:05,250
So that 50 percent of the population has
adequate levels,

1018
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,280
the other 50 percent will be deficient.
So like there's a bell curve.

1019
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:09,114
And so it's like literally in the middle
of the bell curve and then the RDA is 

1020
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:14,040
set from that two standard deviations 
above.

1021
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:14,874
And it's supposed to make about 97 point
five percent of the population gets 

1022
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:19,583
enough.
So that's how the Rda set for each 

1023
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:23,004
micronutrient.
It's different than the experiments are 

1024
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,200
done,
are different to look at them.

1025
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,570
So there's a few concerns,
of course,

1026
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,270
with an all meat diet with particular 
micronutrients,

1027
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,670
because you know,
micronutrients,

1028
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,620
there's a lot of,
you know,

1029
00:46:34,621 --> 00:46:35,454
certain micronutrients that are 
concentrated in meat and there's a lot 

1030
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:38,574
that are concentrated in plants and you 
can find some of the ones that are more 

1031
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:44,700
concentrated in meat in plants,
most in most cases,

1032
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,733
um,
but it's much better to get it from the 

1033
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,410
meat and implants.

1034
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:49,800
There's,
it's much more concentrated,

1035
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,663
you know,
and you can find it in some amounts in 

1036
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:53,100
meat,
but it's much,

1037
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,310
you know,
it's a lot easier to get it from plants.

1038
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:57,503
So,
uh,

1039
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,351
one of the,
of course,

1040
00:46:58,351 --> 00:47:00,180
the micronutrients that the concern is 
the vitamin C,

1041
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,150
of course,
right?

1042
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:01,983
That's,
that's the one that everyone talks 

1043
00:47:02,761 --> 00:47:03,594
about.

1044
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:10,120
So vitamin C is a really important 
cofactor for what that means as cofactor

1045
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:12,870
just means that it's binds to an enzyme 
and helps it work.

1046
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:13,883
It's important for making Collagen.
It's important for converting dopamine 

1047
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:18,210
into norepinephrine,
which is important for that,

1048
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,980
you know,
flight or flight response.

1049
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:21,860
Um,
it plays a role in,

1050
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,700
and I'm making carnitine which is 
important for using fatty acids for,

1051
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,350
it's for energy.
Um,

1052
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,573
and then of course an antioxidant.
It also plays a really important role 

1053
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:33,550
in,
in neutrophils.

1054
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:37,390
Their neutrophils are a type of immune 
cell when they're activated,

1055
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:39,760
when you have any sort of bacterial 
exposure,

1056
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:41,920
um,
virus,

1057
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,320
uh,
things that can even come from the gut,

1058
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,180
you know,
like Lps,

1059
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,180
we get from dead bacteria that are dying
in the gut.

1060
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,733
Neutrophils get activated and they soak 
up vitamin C because they release a 

1061
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:57,370
bunch of hydrogen peroxide which damages
the neutrophil itself.

1062
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,680
And so the vitamin C's sort of prevents 
that from happening,

1063
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,173
uh,
plays a really important role in cell 

1064
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,920
cell integrity and things like that.
So the,

1065
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:06,843
the um,
there's a variety of ways and vitamin C 

1066
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:12,130
is transported into the cell.
And I see a reading on the Internet,

1067
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,080
a little bit of misunderstanding.
People following the carnivore diet seem

1068
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:19,210
to think that because they're not 
getting any,

1069
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,800
uh,
their glucose levels are low,

1070
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,810
that they're getting more vitamin C in.
So,

1071
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:28,390
so vitamin C,
I'm also called ascorbic acid.

1072
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:29,853
A goes between two different states or 
scorebig acid is the reduced form which 

1073
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:38,710
has the antioxidant form.
It goes also into an oxidized form,

1074
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:39,544
so it's kind of going back and forth.
It goes through about four cycles of 

1075
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:42,430
that,
the oxidized form,

1076
00:48:42,431 --> 00:48:43,264
it's called dehydroascorbic acid,
and there's two ways that you transport 

1077
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:48,610
vitamin C,
you absorb it to the gut.

1078
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,000
Epithelial cells is transported into a 
variety of tissues in the body.

1079
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:56,020
Ascorbic acid goes through sodium 
dependent vitamin C transporters.

1080
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:00,040
Those are not dependent on glucose.
There's no competition for glucose.

1081
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:02,860
The that's,
that's how vitamin C gets into the cell,

1082
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:04,363
and most cells actually transport 
vitamin C in that form with the 

1083
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:10,240
exception of red blood cells,
which don't have that transporter.

1084
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:13,150
They use another transporter called 
glucose transporters or glute,

1085
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:16,300
and that one does.
Glucose does compete.

1086
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,350
Interestingly,
dehydroascorbic acid binds much better.

1087
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:21,723
Uh,
it's actually slightly more by binds to 

1088
00:49:23,231 --> 00:49:25,540
the transporter.
Then I'm glucose.

1089
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,750
But in conditions like,
um,

1090
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,400
hyperglycemia,
like type one or type two diabetics,

1091
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,970
they actually don't get vitamin C into 
the red blood cells and it leads to like

1092
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,650
vascular problems and stuff like that.
So,

1093
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,143
so,
um,

1094
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,320
it's an interesting hypothesis that 
maybe if you're having,

1095
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,250
you know,
less of a,

1096
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:43,084
um,
your blood glucose levels are really 

1097
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:45,250
bottomed out.

1098
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,920
Maybe there maybe that there's some 
salvage pathway,

1099
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:48,754
you're able to help get vitamin C in the
oxidized form is going in some other 

1100
00:49:52,301 --> 00:49:53,980
cells that usually doesn't go in or 
whatever,

1101
00:49:53,981 --> 00:49:56,050
something like that.
It's an interesting hypothesis,

1102
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:57,350
which is there's no data on,
right.

1103
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,160
But the experiments that were done to 
choose the rda for vitamin C,

1104
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,660
we're done,
um,

1105
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:05,783
the,
the more recent rda so that it changed 

1106
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,480
back in like two that after 2000 or 2001
or something,

1107
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,350
it's about 90 milligrams a day for men 
and 75 for women,

1108
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,990
they were,
they were depletion repletion studies.

1109
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:17,824
So men were,
were given about less than five 

1110
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:23,920
milligrams a day of vitamin C,
you die with their diet.

1111
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,110
And this was about a six months to 
study.

1112
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:28,310
There were in a metabolic ward.
And,

1113
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:29,144
um,
it was determined that it was kind of 

1114
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,560
unsafe to keep,
to keep going.

1115
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:34,873
So,
so basically they started the repletion 

1116
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:39,080
where they started giving,
uh,

1117
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,460
the,
these men,

1118
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,323
vitamin C at different doses and a 
vitamin C follows like a sigmoidal s 

1119
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:46,303
curve.
So once you kind of deplete someone in 

1120
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,450
their vitamin C,
when you give them,

1121
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:51,920
for example,
30 milligrams,

1122
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:52,843
it isn't really enough to kind of go,
it doesn't really raise plasma levels 

1123
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:57,920
much.
You have to get up to 100.

1124
00:50:58,490 --> 00:50:59,323
Once you get up to 100,
then you actually start to excrete 

1125
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:03,740
vitamin C.
But before that you're just,

1126
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:06,020
your body's holding onto everything or 
not excluding anything.

1127
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,710
Two hundred milligrams was a maximum 
bioavailability.

1128
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,020
And then after that,
um,

1129
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,780
you start to decrease bioavailability.
New York screening a lot of identity.

1130
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,280
So the,
the new.

1131
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,190
So the scientists that published this 
paper,

1132
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:20,220
Mark Levine at the Nih,
um,

1133
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:24,170
recommended that the RDA be set at 200 
milligrams,

1134
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:25,004
but it was set at 90,
which is literally right before you 

1135
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:29,390
start to excrete,
which was 100 milligrams.

1136
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,850
That data,
along with the neutrophil data,

1137
00:51:31,851 --> 00:51:33,650
there were some neutrophil data that was
looked at.

1138
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:34,880
Um,
you know,

1139
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,833
how much vitamin C was it important to.
Because neutrophil sop it up to prevent 

1140
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:40,124
that hydrogen peroxide induced damage.
And so that's kind of how the RJ was 

1141
00:51:42,301 --> 00:51:46,580
said.
I'm now the question is in any,

1142
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,930
with any Rga,
like,

1143
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:49,123
you know,
the important thing to consider is well 

1144
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,260
the rds are set to prevent acute 
disease,

1145
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,590
but what about promoting optimal health?
You know,

1146
00:51:57,591 --> 00:51:58,424
like that's really important.
Like how much are these micronutrients 

1147
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,030
you need throughout our lifespan to,
to,

1148
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,790
you know,
to maintain optimal health and age.

1149
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:05,624
Well,
so this is something that's really 

1150
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:07,394
important because a lot of enzymes that 
require micronutrient for preventing 

1151
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:14,120
short term disease,
something that can kill you.

1152
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,930
Like there's also enzymes that are 
required to prevent,

1153
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,790
you know,
things that are associated with aging,

1154
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:20,840
like DNA damage.

1155
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,870
So if there's only so much of a 
micronutrient around which,

1156
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:26,840
where's it gonna go,
is it going to go where the,

1157
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:27,674
you know,
is it going to prevent any damage which 

1158
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,370
doesn't make a difference until five or 
six decades later?

1159
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:35,330
Or is it gonna make sure you live on to 
pass on your genes and you know,

1160
00:52:35,331 --> 00:52:36,800
reproduce.
And so,

1161
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:38,810
um,
my former postdoctoral mentor,

1162
00:52:38,811 --> 00:52:43,100
Dr Bruce Ames,
proposed this whole and he has published

1163
00:52:43,101 --> 00:52:46,700
a couple of foundational papers 
supporting this idea,

1164
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:47,534
which he calls the triage theory.
So he's saying that basically he thinks 

1165
00:52:50,871 --> 00:52:53,210
actually a lot of our days are too low 
and that,

1166
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,044
you know,
optimal rdas will account for how much 

1167
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:57,464
is needed for these longterm functions.
So that's really important to consider 

1168
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:02,800
with the vitamin C,
um,

1169
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:04,620
you know,
it's,

1170
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,120
it's,
it's,

1171
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,540
it's really a small amount that's needed
to,

1172
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:10,930
to be used as a cofactor for,
you know,

1173
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,760
an enzyme for Collagen production and 
you actually don't need that much.

1174
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:15,323
And it was done like studies were done 
years and years ago with that 

1175
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:21,020
established like 10 milligrams of 
vitamin C was enough to prevent scurvy,

1176
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:24,740
which can happen when you're basically,
you don't have enough vitamin C for,

1177
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,370
for college and production.
And,

1178
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,213
um,
and even that's kind of questionable 

1179
00:53:29,311 --> 00:53:31,560
because back at the time when those 
studies were done,

1180
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:35,580
it was before really good analytical 
essays were available.

1181
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:36,414
So,
you know,

1182
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,830
the asset that was done to measure,
um,

1183
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,690
various things were,
it was lots of things could confound,

1184
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:45,450
so it may even be less,
maybe more,

1185
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:46,470
maybe less.
It's kind of not known.

1186
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,970
So,
um,

1187
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,560
you know,
that,

1188
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,960
that,
that is something to consider as well as

1189
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:52,794
the fact that basically there's a lot of
biological variation with vitamin C 

1190
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:56,904
requirements and this has been shown in 
other animals that also require vitamin 

1191
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,170
C,
like Guinea pigs.

1192
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:05,340
So like if you take 100 Guinea pigs and 
this is published back in the sixties or

1193
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:06,800
seventies,
um,

1194
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,890
like there was like 10 fold variation in
how much each of them required vitamin C

1195
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:12,570
they required even though they were 
given like,

1196
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,050
wow.

1197
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,880
Yeah.
So tenfold.

1198
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:15,870
Tenfold.
Yeah.

1199
00:54:15,871 --> 00:54:16,704
So there's huge variation in the half 
life of vitamin C and in their 

1200
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:23,130
transporters.
And so this has been shown in rodents as

1201
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:24,930
well.
Rodin's make vitamin C and their liver.

1202
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:28,770
But the same thing has been shown.
And actually back when this,

1203
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,220
the European sailors were getting scurvy
and dying of it,

1204
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,113
only about 50 percent.
Only about half of those dealers got 

1205
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,203
scurvy.
The other 50 percent didn't have any 

1206
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:40,680
symptoms,
presumably because not getting scurvy.

1207
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,690
That's what I'm saying.
I'm saying that,

1208
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,330
you know,
for one it doesn't take much.

1209
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,580
Right.
Or getting some of it from me.

1210
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:48,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

1211
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,770
And so,
so the thing,

1212
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,620
you know,
it,

1213
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,000
it,
it doesn't take much to,

1214
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:57,790
to maintain the enzymatic function of 
some of the,

1215
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,480
some of the enzymes involved in making 
Collagen and that,

1216
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:02,040
you know,
so it doesn't take much for that.

1217
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,320
But the question is about what about,
you know,

1218
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:09,020
all the host of all the factors and the 
neutrophils and um,

1219
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,953
you know,
your body stores like orders of 

1220
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:15,000
magnitude more vitamin C than then than 
it needs for that,

1221
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:16,800
for the,
for its function as a cofactor.

1222
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:17,963
And it's like why does it do that?
Is it just because maybe during scarce 

1223
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,300
food scarcity you want and wants to make
sure it has enough or is there are,

1224
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:24,443
you know,
the antioxidant functions and other 

1225
00:55:25,231 --> 00:55:27,900
functions really important or other 
unknown functions.

1226
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,090
So I think the vitamin C,
you know,

1227
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,830
there are certainly,
you know,

1228
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,693
getting enough to prevent scurvy and 
there could be biological variation in 

1229
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:37,170
that as well.
Right?

1230
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,590
You don't need much to prevent scurvy in
the junior.

1231
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,340
You're dealing with a very small sample 
size.

1232
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:44,070
You don't know how many people are 
actually on this or supplementing,

1233
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,313
right?
How many of them are supplementing and 

1234
00:55:46,381 --> 00:55:48,120
why wouldn't they be right.
Yeah,

1235
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,790
exactly.
Um,

1236
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,873
when you think that a lot of these 
issues could be prevented with just 

1237
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,500
multivitamin and supplementation.
Well,

1238
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:58,290
I mean,
I think the best thing is to get it from

1239
00:55:58,291 --> 00:55:59,190
food and we'll talk through it.

1240
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,470
Yeah.
Um,

1241
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,580
you know,
so the,

1242
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,413
the,
there's another one that's potentially 

1243
00:56:03,331 --> 00:56:04,164
risky and that is vitamin E,
which kind of vitamin D helps recycle 

1244
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:11,730
vitamin C and vitamin C helps recycle 
vitamin E and vitamin e actually,

1245
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,980
um,
most people think of as an antioxidant,

1246
00:56:13,981 --> 00:56:17,610
which it does,
it prevents a lot of oxidative chains.

1247
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:19,350
It's kind of breaks the chain of 
oxidation,

1248
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,380
but also is really important for 
maintaining cell integrity.

1249
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:25,210
And that's how the Rda was chosen for 
that one.

1250
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,373
So,
um,

1251
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,333
how does it do that?
So it's important for inside the cell 

1252
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:30,580
membrane,
so it's,

1253
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:31,414
uh,
it's important antioxidant inside the 

1254
00:56:32,051 --> 00:56:32,884
cell membrane and so it's preventing a 
lot of oxidative factors that are 

1255
00:56:36,011 --> 00:56:38,050
happening just from normal metabolism,
normal,

1256
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,210
what's happening.
You and I are doing it right now,

1257
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:45,280
a DNA damage that damage our DNA.
It also damages the Lipitz in our,

1258
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:46,480
in our cell membranes.

1259
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:48,260
And so,
and so vitamin E,

1260
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:51,220
it plays a really important role in the 
integrity of it.

1261
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,630
And so,
um,

1262
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:56,380
the experiments that were done for 
choosing the RDA for vitamin E,

1263
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,633
we're two and a half years long and um,
men were given three milligrams of 

1264
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:04,870
vitamin E,
so the RDA is 15 milligrams.

1265
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:05,704
So they were given three and after two 
and a half years they started getting 

1266
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:11,710
hemolysis of the red blood cells because
they're red blood cell.

1267
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:12,933
Um,
the membranes of the red blood cells 

1268
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:15,064
weren't being maintained very well.
After two and a half it took two and a 

1269
00:57:17,561 --> 00:57:19,390
half years.
It's a long time for,

1270
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,920
you know,
for this to show up.

1271
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,113
And so,
um,

1272
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:22,983
for whatever reason,
it was decided that having hemo license 

1273
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:28,600
happen lower than 12 percent is okay,
12 percent was the cutoff.

1274
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,790
And so they,
when they did the depletion studies,

1275
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:31,624
it was 15,
it was actually 12 milligrams and then 

1276
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:36,240
for the ear and they went up two 
standard deviations and found 15.

1277
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,840
Basically the RDA was at 15.
So the question becomes,

1278
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:42,940
well right,
so vitamin D you can,

1279
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,833
you know,
you can get some vitamin E if you're 

1280
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,733
eating some egg yolks and butter and if 
you're eating some fish but you're not 

1281
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:48,844
going to,
it's really hard to get 15 milligrams 

1282
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:51,670
from,
from those sources.

1283
00:57:51,671 --> 00:57:53,020
And,
and then if you're eating that,

1284
00:57:53,021 --> 00:57:55,390
what about all the other stuff you have 
to eat to get your other,

1285
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:56,224
you know,
so it is a good source of nuts are 

1286
00:57:58,151 --> 00:57:59,560
really,
really the best source.

1287
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:01,090
Like almonds,
like 100 grand,

1288
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,430
100 grams of almonds with like give you 
your rda.

1289
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,830
Really good source.
Um,

1290
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,860
so,
uh,

1291
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,700
so the question becomes,
well,

1292
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:10,970
okay,
you know,

1293
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,410
what happens if I'm only getting seven 
milligrams a day,

1294
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,060
is it going to take,
you know,

1295
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,123
six or seven or eight years before my 
cell membrane integrity is compromised 

1296
00:58:20,411 --> 00:58:21,550
more,
you know,

1297
00:58:21,551 --> 00:58:22,900
what you know.

1298
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,733
So it's just,
there's a lot of important questions to 

1299
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:26,470
think about,
you know,

1300
00:58:26,471 --> 00:58:27,304
and it's like these rdas I would even 
argue they're set too low in some cases 

1301
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:33,634
where you're really trying to just 
prevent things like that are like 

1302
00:58:36,491 --> 00:58:38,020
hemolysis,
lysis of the red blood cells.

1303
00:58:38,021 --> 00:58:40,510
And so what about all these other 
longterm effects?

1304
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,960
Um,
you know,

1305
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,960
enzymes that are involved in DNA repair 
for example.

1306
00:58:43,961 --> 00:58:46,780
And another one would be like fully a 
full eight.

1307
00:58:46,781 --> 00:58:47,614
You can get if you eat,
if you're eating like 150 grams of 

1308
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:53,740
cooked beef liver every day.
But like who does that?

1309
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:54,371
You know,
I mean,

1310
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:55,660
and if you're not doing that and you're 
eating,

1311
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:58,720
you got to eat like you're 48 starting 
to get your vitamin E and you've got,

1312
00:58:58,721 --> 00:58:59,554
you know,
so it's like,

1313
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,170
it's not easy.
And I'm not saying you can't get,

1314
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,840
you know,
some amounts of it,

1315
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,490
but you may not be getting the RDA.

1316
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:10,870
And so foliate plays a very important 
role in actually making new DNA,

1317
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,360
you know,
if you don't have full eight,

1318
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:14,194
you essentially incorporate something 
from rna called Eurocell into DNA and 

1319
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:18,514
all your like Dna polymerases and stuff.
We're cruising along and see and then 

1320
00:59:21,761 --> 00:59:24,240
make a nick in the DNA and it literally,
you know,

1321
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:25,340
it's a,
it's a nick,

1322
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:26,270
it's like uh,
in your,

1323
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,920
in your DNA.
And if you have it,

1324
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,440
DNA is double stranded.
It's,

1325
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,160
we have it on two ends,
the DNA,

1326
00:59:31,161 --> 00:59:31,994
what you do,
because it's really important to make 

1327
00:59:32,841 --> 00:59:35,590
one of the nucleotides timing.
Then you know,

1328
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,860
you're going to have a double stranded 
break.

1329
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,350
And actually my former postdoctoral 
mentor,

1330
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:40,184
Dr Bruce Ames,
published a study showing that if you 

1331
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:43,034
take animals and um,
make them deficient in full eight or 

1332
00:59:45,801 --> 00:59:47,480
give them really,
really low levels of full late,

1333
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,570
it causes strands and their dna just 
like being irradiated.

1334
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:53,090
Like he compared them side by side.
It was east exact same thing.

1335
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:58,450
And then he published a study that was 
with humans showing that actually humans

1336
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:03,260
that are getting really low levels of 
full late also had a certain type of DNA

1337
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:05,990
damage called micro nuclei.
You know.

1338
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:07,130
So the question is,
well,

1339
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,350
you know,
if I,

1340
01:00:09,351 --> 01:00:11,780
if I'm getting only so much fully,
you know,

1341
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:14,830
is,
is it something happening to my dna,

1342
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,940
my getting strand breaks.
The same goes for magnesium.

1343
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,640
I mean,
you can get magnesium if you're eating,

1344
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:20,240
you know,
this,

1345
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,850
it's just been,
what about the day?

1346
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,630
And then what about the bottom e?
But you know,

1347
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:26,840
so it's really hard.
It's really hard,

1348
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,120
uh,
to,

1349
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,500
to do that.
And Dna damage,

1350
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,660
that's something you can't measure it.
You're not going to go.

1351
01:00:32,661 --> 01:00:36,140
Your Lipid panel isn't going to tell you
that there's no consumer test available.

1352
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:39,710
There was a few years ago with a startup
tried doing it,

1353
01:00:39,711 --> 01:00:44,711
but it's really hard because there's,
if you're sending blood samples to a lab

1354
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,833
to be tested for DNA damage.
I have done many dna damage experiments 

1355
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:52,250
on humans.
So clinical studies.

1356
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:54,560
I was involved in Dr Ames lab.
Um,

1357
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:55,463
and I've done studies,
kinetic studies where we took blood out 

1358
01:00:57,831 --> 01:01:01,730
of a patient measure DNA damage 
immediately or frozen down,

1359
01:01:01,731 --> 01:01:03,560
or we let it sit on a bench for 30 
minutes,

1360
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:05,990
two hours,
four hours overnight after two hours,

1361
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:06,913
all the tons of DNA damage that had come
up because it's being exposed to the 

1362
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,310
oxygen and all that is I'm creating 
basically DNA damage.

1363
01:01:13,311 --> 01:01:14,840
So anyways,
the point is,

1364
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:17,630
is that DNA damage isn't something 
you're going to measure.

1365
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,840
You don't feel it and you're not going 
to feel it.

1366
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:22,520
I mean,
it's happening in us right now.

1367
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:24,050
We don't know how many,
but it is.

1368
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:25,303
We have enzymes that are repairing that 
damage and those enzymes require 

1369
01:01:27,501 --> 01:01:30,740
magnesium.
We're getting enough folate to make sure

1370
01:01:30,741 --> 01:01:32,570
that that damage isn't happening.
And again,

1371
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:33,404
you can get a good amount of full liver 
is one of the best is really great 

1372
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:37,760
source,
but you have to eat it every day and you

1373
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:38,900
have to like,
you know,

1374
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,600
I guess 150 grams of livers,
not that much,

1375
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:43,760
but you have to eat it every day,
you know.

1376
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:45,290
Um,
so it's,

1377
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,390
it's just really important to consider 
these,

1378
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:48,783
you know,
the fact that these micronutrients are 

1379
01:01:49,731 --> 01:01:51,290
important,
they have longterm effects.

1380
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,124
I mean the two and a half years it took 
to show the hemo license and red blood 

1381
01:01:55,341 --> 01:01:56,174
cells two and a half years.
So what happens if you're getting a 

1382
01:01:58,431 --> 01:02:00,380
modest amount,
not quite three milligrams,

1383
01:02:00,381 --> 01:02:02,870
but you're getting twice that or maybe 
you're getting nine,

1384
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,850
you know,
what happens seven years from now,

1385
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:06,940
like you don't know it's in.

1386
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:09,050
It's important that your health is 
important.

1387
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:11,480
So I think that.
So those,

1388
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:13,850
you know,
and there's a variety of other magazines

1389
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:18,230
you can also get if you're eating a lot 
of like a stomach lining tripe.

1390
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:19,950
So it's called [inaudible].
Yeah.

1391
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,810
I mean,
so it's not like you can't get it,

1392
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:23,063
but they're not.
Most of these people that are carnivore 

1393
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:26,130
diet or just eating beef,
right?

1394
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:27,023
Especially if the people are working a 
job where they go in to an office nine 

1395
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:33,900
to five or they're traveling and it's a 
really hard to eat all this cool.

1396
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:34,471
Like,
you know,

1397
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:37,260
the,
the inuits were eating things like raw,

1398
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,050
like they were eating raw liver,
Raul,

1399
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:42,750
like raw whale blubber and spleen 
spleen's a good source.

1400
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:44,640
I mean you can get vitamin C from 
spleen,

1401
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,820
I think heart.
So there's some organs,

1402
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,900
vitamin C when you cook it,
25 percent of it's lost.

1403
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:54,420
So that's why a lot of the muscle meat 
and stuff,

1404
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,940
it does start out with vitamin C,
but when you cook it,

1405
01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:00,650
I mean if you're not eating it raw,
then you're definitely,

1406
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:01,530
it's negligible.

1407
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:02,873
One young guy who is a carnivore diet 
proponent that seems to be approaching 

1408
01:03:06,571 --> 01:03:07,404
this in a much more comprehensive way.
He's really big on organ meats in 

1409
01:03:10,471 --> 01:03:12,360
particular,
liver and many other things.

1410
01:03:12,361 --> 01:03:15,780
And he's talking about how these organ 
meats,

1411
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:16,850
uh,
will,

1412
01:03:16,851 --> 01:03:17,684
uh,
be excellent sources of a lot of the 

1413
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:23,040
vitamins that people are concerned that 
you're missing from vegetables.

1414
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:26,340
You're,
do you think that that is possible?

1415
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:29,400
And it means spleen,
I guess for vitamin C.

1416
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,600
But like what?
Uh,

1417
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:35,280
what about just liver or kidneys or 
things along those lines?

1418
01:03:35,281 --> 01:03:37,500
Mean what,
what are you going to be deficient in?

1419
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:39,150
If you go the organ meat route,

1420
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,060
I mean I think that,
you know,

1421
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,770
if you're the,
the magnesium and um,

1422
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:47,703
uh,
the magazine won't be in while you're 

1423
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:49,270
out there.
Can you give me another one who's.

1424
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,820
Thanks,
I'm magnesium,

1425
01:03:52,821 --> 01:03:54,590
but you can get.
I mean it's,

1426
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,750
you can do it right.
I mean you can do it,

1427
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:57,973
but um,
it seems very difficult and I don't 

1428
01:04:00,321 --> 01:04:02,870
think most people will do it.
And you recommend of course,

1429
01:04:02,871 --> 01:04:06,320
getting all this stuff from food.
If you were going to get magnesium,

1430
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:08,400
but it did.

1431
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:13,630
Is it feasible that you could just 
supplement with multivitamins and,

1432
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,960
and cover all your bases?
You know what I mean?

1433
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:18,590
I think the same goes for Vegetarians.
I think they should,

1434
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:21,230
you know,
they do supplement and they take the 12,

1435
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:24,050
they take iron,
which isn't necessarily.

1436
01:04:24,051 --> 01:04:27,530
I think it's much better to take iron,
get iron from food.

1437
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:31,400
It's not as bioavailable in a pill form.
Also,

1438
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:32,263
the Bible belt,
the pill form has been shown to disrupt 

1439
01:04:34,431 --> 01:04:35,264
other things like,
whereas iron from food isn't just 

1440
01:04:39,111 --> 01:04:40,790
depends on the ratios of other things 
like,

1441
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,230
you know,
disrupting,

1442
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:43,453
disrupting the transport of other 
transition elements and things like 

1443
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:47,990
that.
It's isolated also.

1444
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:49,100
Yeah,
something about that.

1445
01:04:49,101 --> 01:04:52,430
Also there's bacteria in the gut that 
um,

1446
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:55,460
that can be pathogenic and that use 
iron,

1447
01:04:55,461 --> 01:04:57,980
but it seems to be only in supplemental 
form that that's.

1448
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:58,983
I'm not saying you should never 
supplement supplement iron throughout 

1449
01:05:00,711 --> 01:05:01,544
my,
uh,

1450
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:02,503
third trimester,
but I just think that you're going to 

1451
01:05:04,731 --> 01:05:07,030
potentially run into more problems.
Um,

1452
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:08,830
with that,
you know,

1453
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,390
iron does it.
It does come from bread,

1454
01:05:11,391 --> 01:05:12,170
meat,
correct.

1455
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,450
Yeah,
I mean irons very bioavailable when it's

1456
01:05:14,451 --> 01:05:18,310
bound to hemoglobin and versus 
vegetarians just ate red meat.

1457
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,240
You know,
there's,

1458
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:22,961
there's,
there's,

1459
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:23,794
I think that,
that there's a whole other host of 

1460
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,890
micronutrients that vegetarians are 
there,

1461
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:30,460
but that's not what we're talking about.
So I think,

1462
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,570
you know,
um,

1463
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:37,020
there's also other important reasons to 
eat the plants instead of doing just the

1464
01:05:37,061 --> 01:05:39,400
organ meat and also just doing the 
supplements as well,

1465
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:42,730
you know,
in some of those reasons have to do with

1466
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,740
the fact that microbiome is really 
important.

1467
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:45,770
So you're getting,
you know,

1468
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:46,743
the fermentable types of fiber that are 
really important for growing all sorts 

1469
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:50,164
of commensal bacteria in the gut.
Like we don't know what's gonna happen 

1470
01:05:51,941 --> 01:05:53,060
with,
you know,

1471
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:55,300
someone that's only just eating meat 
longterm,

1472
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,040
particularly with,
like I said,

1473
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:57,874
the putrifactive bacteria and all that.
I mean that's just a word future future 

1474
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:02,710
Fi.
Yeah,

1475
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:06,880
that's the Fed feathers.
Putrifactive bacteria also that are like

1476
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,070
on corpses and stuff.

1477
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,590
In fact,
that's where I think the cadaveric comes

1478
01:06:11,591 --> 01:06:13,910
from the work they produce something 
evergreen,

1479
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,580
right?
That's what I'm thinking.

1480
01:06:15,581 --> 01:06:20,410
It must be where it should have a huge 
chip and cadaveric mean.

1481
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,510
Sounds,
sounds like farts.

1482
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:24,430
So I was like,
they actually are.

1483
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:25,640
Yeah,
they do the portrait.

1484
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:29,500
I think there's a response with some of 
the really nasty parts.

1485
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,330
Um,
but you know,

1486
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,640
like that.
So that's another reason.

1487
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:35,470
And then the other,
the other important thing,

1488
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:37,660
or the phytochemicals,
the,

1489
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:38,543
the,
there's these polyphenols and all these 

1490
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:44,050
things that are present in plant the 
humans were,

1491
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:46,090
we evolved eating,
we evolved eating them,

1492
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:47,183
you know,
so,

1493
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:48,730
so the,
the,

1494
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,550
it's during,
throughout human evolution,

1495
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:52,450
you know,
humans,

1496
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:56,470
we're stressed on many levels.
One,

1497
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,870
they went through moments of food 
scarcity where the fasting came in.

1498
01:06:58,871 --> 01:07:00,370
I mean,
that's important right now.

1499
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:03,340
We don't have that.
We can get food all the time,

1500
01:07:03,341 --> 01:07:04,174
anytime,
right?

1501
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:06,970
So,
so that was an important,

1502
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:08,390
um,
uh,

1503
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,670
stress that humans have evolved with 
exercise aerobic exercise,

1504
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,840
right?
That's another thing.

1505
01:07:13,841 --> 01:07:14,580
I mean,
you had to,

1506
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:17,560
you had to move to get food and run from
predators.

1507
01:07:17,561 --> 01:07:18,394
I mean,
so we,

1508
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:19,263
we evolved exercising.
Now you can see so many people don't do 

1509
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:27,070
that.
We also evolved eating plants and meat.

1510
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,120
I mean,
we're omnivores.

1511
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,133
So we have these basically all these 
pathways that are activated when we eat 

1512
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:37,160
plants and from certain compounds in 
plants into insect Antifa,

1513
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:38,340
Eden's,
their,

1514
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:39,670
their,
their implants.

1515
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:40,773
And when humans eat them,
they basically activate a variety of 

1516
01:07:43,271 --> 01:07:44,104
really,
really important stress response 

1517
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,500
pathways.
A lot of these pathways get activated by

1518
01:07:47,501 --> 01:07:48,334
exercise and fasting as well,
so there is a lot of overlap between 

1519
01:07:51,011 --> 01:07:53,950
them,
but I see a lot of people,

1520
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,090
you know,
on the,

1521
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:58,450
on this carnivore diet,
talking about how they're so bad for you

1522
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:03,280
and if they would take the time to 
actually read studies,

1523
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:04,263
human studies where people are given a 
lot of these insect antifa didn't 

1524
01:08:06,761 --> 01:08:10,050
compounds things like I said thiocyanate
like Sulforaphane,

1525
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:13,720
I'm curcumin,
resveratrol,

1526
01:08:13,721 --> 01:08:16,100
anthocyanins,
and just tons and tons of them,

1527
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,593
you know,
they would see that there's beneficial 

1528
01:08:18,531 --> 01:08:21,620
effects that happen and there's a lot of
mechanism for why that is,

1529
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,560
you know,
so I mean the Sulforaphane is one that I

1530
01:08:24,561 --> 01:08:25,394
like to talk about and there are,
there's tons and tons of human 

1531
01:08:28,461 --> 01:08:32,900
intervention data where people are given
either cruciferous vegetables or they're

1532
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:34,070
given Broccoli sprouts.

1533
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,080
Broccoli sprouts are really great 
source,

1534
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,330
cruciferous vegetables,
Broccoli,

1535
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:40,910
cabbage,
fermented cabbage,

1536
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,310
Brussel sprouts,
you know,

1537
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:45,240
all that stuff.
So Broccoli sprouts have like 10,

1538
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:46,123
anywhere between 10 and 100 times more.
A lot of that work was done by Dr Jed 

1539
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:49,671
Fahy,
friend of mine,

1540
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:51,920
he's at Johns Hopkins,
very great scientist,

1541
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:54,920
as a lot of research on sulforaphane.
But,

1542
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:55,880
um,
you know,

1543
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,440
if you look at intervention trials,
we were talking about air pollution,

1544
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:59,283
like there's an intervention trial.
There's more than one showing in humans 

1545
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:05,540
showing that if you give humans Broccoli
sprout extract for seven days,

1546
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:06,374
they start to excrete benzene and 
accurately and Benzenes in air 

1547
01:09:08,631 --> 01:09:11,390
pollution.
Sixty percent on day one.

1548
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,100
Like they started screening it in their 
urine,

1549
01:09:13,101 --> 01:09:13,934
like you're getting rid of that.
And that's largely because sulforaphane 

1550
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,083
activates a variety of enzymes,
one called phase two detoxification 

1551
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:23,800
enzymes,
which are important for getting rid of a

1552
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,340
potentially harmful compounds.

1553
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:28,370
It inactivates phase one 
biotransformation enzymes,

1554
01:09:28,371 --> 01:09:32,990
which are enzymes that are able to like 
take a pro carcinogen and turn it into a

1555
01:09:32,991 --> 01:09:34,550
carcinogen.
So,

1556
01:09:34,551 --> 01:09:35,540
um,
you know,

1557
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:37,700
there's intervention trials in humans 
that it's,

1558
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:38,683
you know,
men that were given Broccoli sprout 

1559
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,470
extract,
a lowered their,

1560
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:45,410
their,
their biomarker for prostate cancer,

1561
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:46,430
um,
by,

1562
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:50,030
by like 86 percent or lower the doubling
rate of about 86 percent.

1563
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:51,510
You know,
so this is like,

1564
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,453
this is important.
There's studies showing that humans 

1565
01:09:54,021 --> 01:09:54,831
given,
for example,

1566
01:09:54,831 --> 01:09:55,664
two different studies showing that 
humans given 300 grams of Brussel 

1567
01:09:57,601 --> 01:09:59,150
sprouts a day.
One,

1568
01:09:59,151 --> 01:09:59,984
they increase a really important 
antioxidant in their plasma called 

1569
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:03,103
glutathione by like one point four fold 
and they decreased oxidative DNA damage 

1570
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:09,254
in their blood cells.
Dna damage like we were just talking 

1571
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:11,714
about,
they decreased it like by 30 percent or 

1572
01:10:14,091 --> 01:10:16,220
something like that.
Two separate studies,

1573
01:10:16,221 --> 01:10:19,070
Brussel sprouts and I liked,
I see people like,

1574
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:22,310
you know,
I'm talking about the carnivore diet and

1575
01:10:22,311 --> 01:10:23,144
how sulforaphane increases DNA damage 
and they like referenced this in vitro 

1576
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:31,100
study where they dumped sulforaphane on 
cultured cells in a dish.

1577
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:31,731
It's like,
you know,

1578
01:10:31,731 --> 01:10:34,430
what else is going to do that shit 
heterocyclic amines from the cooked meat

1579
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:36,350
you're eating like you know,
so.

1580
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,650
So if you dump something at a high 
enough concentration,

1581
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:41,270
yeah,
it's going to fuck it up,

1582
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:42,453
you know,
but we're talking about humans 

1583
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:44,744
ingesting.
If you were to exercise nonstop and not 

1584
01:10:46,401 --> 01:10:47,810
rest,
it would be toxic.

1585
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:51,140
If you were to fast and not stop,
it would be toxic.

1586
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:52,070
Like,
you know,

1587
01:10:52,071 --> 01:10:52,851
so,
so,

1588
01:10:52,851 --> 01:10:53,684
so,
so how some of these pathways are 

1589
01:10:54,861 --> 01:10:57,290
working is that they,
the dose that they're given,

1590
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:58,080
you know,
eating,

1591
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:58,913
it's almost impossible to,
to eat the kind of dose that it would 

1592
01:11:02,151 --> 01:11:04,280
take to cause severe damage and you 
know,

1593
01:11:04,281 --> 01:11:05,780
what you would get sick,
you would know,

1594
01:11:05,781 --> 01:11:06,614
you'd be like,
wait a minute.

1595
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:07,893
Like so.
So I mean I think that using that as an 

1596
01:11:10,221 --> 01:11:12,350
excuse is really,
um,

1597
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:14,550
first of all,
they should read the studies and there's

1598
01:11:14,551 --> 01:11:15,480
so many more studies.

1599
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:19,020
It's been shown recently to increase 
gludethyon in the brain.

1600
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,003
Human intervention studies,
humans that were given sulforaphane 

1601
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,510
extract,
increase it in their plasma and in their

1602
01:11:24,511 --> 01:11:26,750
brain.
Gludethyon was one of the major and Alex

1603
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,890
in the brain plays a major role in 
traumatic brain injury,

1604
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:31,860
brain aging.
I mean this is important.

1605
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,900
Like this is a possible therapeutic 
intervention.

1606
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,003
It's been shown in randomized placebo 
controlled trials to improve autistic 

1607
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:40,020
symptoms and adolescents open label 
trials.

1608
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:41,790
It's been shown to improve autism in 
children,

1609
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:42,990
autistic symptoms,
children.

1610
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:44,203
I mean,
there's just study after study after 

1611
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:48,090
study and I'm just talking about the 
human ones and there's more,

1612
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:51,670
there's also lots of animal studies 
where they're feeding a mega doses and,

1613
01:11:51,671 --> 01:11:54,600
and there's positive benefits.
There's been studies,

1614
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:55,830
you know,
feeding,

1615
01:11:55,831 --> 01:11:58,230
feeding humans,
large doses like something equivalent to

1616
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,540
like 70 or 100 grams of Broccoli 
sprouts,

1617
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:03,320
which have a lot more so for her fame 
than like Brussels sprouts do.

1618
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:06,420
And there was no toxic side effects in 
the liver.

1619
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:09,300
Thyroid.
That's one concern people do have if you

1620
01:12:09,301 --> 01:12:12,510
have hyperthyroid.
Sulforaphane can compete with iodine for

1621
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:16,020
transport into the thyroid.
I don't think that's usually an issue.

1622
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,970
It certainly doesn't seem to be an issue
in healthy people,

1623
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:18,804
but iodine is found in seafood.
I mean their sources of iodine you can 

1624
01:12:24,211 --> 01:12:27,450
eat.
So maybe someone with hyperthyroid might

1625
01:12:27,451 --> 01:12:28,950
want to make sure they're not eating a 
ton.

1626
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:32,440
Like you're not like know Kale smoothie 
after kills me with the other kids.

1627
01:12:32,441 --> 01:12:33,274
Don't be like me,
you know,

1628
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,133
make sure you know,
just that you're having your Brussels 

1629
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:37,440
sprouts with your,
with your elk meat or whatever.

1630
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:39,600
You know,
I think it's a problem.

1631
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:42,110
Um,
so you know,

1632
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:43,290
it,
I do get a little,

1633
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:44,250
I see,
I see.

1634
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:46,530
Like you mentioned Dr Sean Baker.
He's like,

1635
01:12:46,531 --> 01:12:48,750
he put out a video about like he 
mentioned to me,

1636
01:12:48,751 --> 01:12:51,840
my name's talking about how I only talk 
about in vitro data and I'm like,

1637
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,273
dude,
go watch my video or my interview with 

1638
01:12:55,271 --> 01:12:57,690
the expert at Johns Hopkins.
We're talking about human studies.

1639
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:58,823
The in vitro data is coming from what 
the opposite that had the damaging 

1640
01:13:02,701 --> 01:13:05,080
effects.
It's in vitro dumping.

1641
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:05,910
Get on the culture side.

1642
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:07,500
Just two things going on.
There's one,

1643
01:13:07,501 --> 01:13:09,960
there's a real cursory examination of 
data.

1644
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:13,590
Were they in this confirmation bias and 
it's the combination of the two of those

1645
01:13:13,591 --> 01:13:14,424
things.
They find one thing that's sort of kind 

1646
01:13:16,321 --> 01:13:17,154
of vaguely supports what they wanted to 
support and then they run with it and 

1647
01:13:20,341 --> 01:13:22,020
they talk about it as if they're 
experts.

1648
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,250
Very dangerous.
Yes.

1649
01:13:23,251 --> 01:13:24,084
And this is one of the reasons why I'm 
so happy that you're talking about this 

1650
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:27,823
because you can give people a real 
comprehensive understanding of all the 

1651
01:13:31,801 --> 01:13:32,634
different things at play.
And one of the things that I get from 

1652
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:39,081
you when I talked to you about nutrition
is it's mind boggling how many different

1653
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:41,514
factors are going on simultaneously in 
the human body when it comes to 

1654
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:48,260
nutrition absorption,
when,

1655
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:48,870
uh,
you know,

1656
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:49,703
in the various stages of the body and 
how it can vary with different people 

1657
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:56,123
when there's so much going on.
So when someone just starts talking 

1658
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:01,320
about vegetables are toxic,
like,

1659
01:14:01,321 --> 01:14:02,490
oh,
Jesus Christ,

1660
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,473
read any of the study,
have you just go look at the scientific 

1661
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:08,470
data like on it to

1662
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:10,090
be toxic?
This is what's crazy.

1663
01:14:10,091 --> 01:14:10,924
It's,
this is an,

1664
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:14,020
that's akin to veganism.
It's really,

1665
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:14,970
it's a,
it's a,

1666
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:20,140
just another side of the same mindset.
It's almost like a religious mindset.

1667
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:24,490
They hashtag.
I did say it,

1668
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,140
look,
I'm a fucking mediator.

1669
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:30,960
You can't accuse me of being anti meat,
but I,

1670
01:14:30,961 --> 01:14:35,590
I side,
I eat more vegetables.

1671
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:38,950
I think that I eat meat.
I certainly.

1672
01:14:38,951 --> 01:14:41,800
It's certainly like right up there and 
I'm not giving them up.

1673
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:43,830
I think that's stupid.
I just did.

1674
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:46,090
Doesn't make any sense to me.
And I liked them.

1675
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:50,090
There's this,
there's this weird push and the,

1676
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,050
you know,
if you look under Hashtag meet heels,

1677
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,153
there's all these people telling these 
stories about all the lost all this 

1678
01:14:56,471 --> 01:14:57,304
weight and they did all this,
this blah blah blah and the health 

1679
01:14:59,021 --> 01:14:59,870
benefits and Dah,
Dah,

1680
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:00,221
Dah,
Dah,

1681
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:00,490
Dah,
Dah,

1682
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:01,090
Dah,
Dah.

1683
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:01,923
But they only want it to be because of 
the consumption of meat only they think 

1684
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:07,564
that it's because of the singular aspect
of their diet and the fact that they've 

1685
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:13,060
eliminated everything else,
but they're not,

1686
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,420
they don't do any studying of 
elimination diets.

1687
01:15:16,421 --> 01:15:17,254
They don't do any study of the prolonged
benefits of fasting and all these 

1688
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:22,030
different things that you're talking 
about,

1689
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:22,864
which I think are there.
These are all factors in this really 

1690
01:15:26,921 --> 01:15:27,754
complicated thing that's going on that 
most likely has something to do with 

1691
01:15:31,511 --> 01:15:33,310
their gut biome and their immune system.

1692
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:34,760
Right?
Absolutely.

1693
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:39,010
I mean those are two major confounding 
factors like,

1694
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,610
so major,
you know,

1695
01:15:40,611 --> 01:15:43,850
it's um,
it's important.

1696
01:15:43,851 --> 01:15:47,390
It's just important to approach this 
like a science,

1697
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:48,253
you know,
and,

1698
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,000
and not like a religion,
like you said,

1699
01:15:50,001 --> 01:15:52,130
where you want to believe something.
And so you just find,

1700
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:53,120
you know,
this,

1701
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:57,260
this study that I also see circulating 
around that why plants are really bad to

1702
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:58,810
eat.
It's like they're there,

1703
01:15:58,811 --> 01:15:59,644
they're there means that the insect anti
nutrients or pesticides from my former 

1704
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:04,184
mentor.
Okay,

1705
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:05,263
Dr Bruce Ames who spent his entire 
career like advocating micronutrients 

1706
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:11,630
from vegetables and from me and from 
fish.

1707
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:12,980
Okay.
It's like so ironic,

1708
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:16,610
but if you actually read the paper,
not only does it say it doesn't,

1709
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:17,510
you know,
these,

1710
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:21,410
these insect antifa like sulforaphane 
don't cause cancer,

1711
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:26,411
but it also has a whole section on 
heterocyclic amines from cooked meat.

1712
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:31,100
So if you really want to use that paper 
as an argument why to not eat plants,

1713
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,080
then maybe read the paper and realize,
oh,

1714
01:16:33,081 --> 01:16:35,990
it's also talking about heterocyclic 
amines as well.

1715
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:38,770
The point of the paper was like,
I'm getting a little emotional.

1716
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:40,293
I like it.
The point of your robot self appointed 

1717
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,833
the paper was basically not to worry 
about like some of the amounts that 

1718
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:50,270
you're being exposed to you with some of
these natural,

1719
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:52,760
you know,
an insect antifa edits that are found in

1720
01:16:52,761 --> 01:16:55,450
plants.
And some of the cook things and meet and

1721
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:56,293
as well as some of the pesticides that 
are found synthetic pesticides because 

1722
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:01,010
basically that they're in such small 
amounts that,

1723
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,470
so that was Kinda the point of the paper
was back in the nineties.

1724
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,240
Um,
and,

1725
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:09,740
but I just think that it's a little 
hypocritical to use paper,

1726
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:10,880
you know,
as a,

1727
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,220
as like.
And literally it's like,

1728
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,480
I mean,
it's like proliferated everywhere.

1729
01:17:14,481 --> 01:17:16,160
That's.
I see this paper all the time.

1730
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:19,100
Say Well did you read the paper because 
it has a whole section on,

1731
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:21,980
um,
on the insect antibiotics from coffee,

1732
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:24,830
which a lot of people drink.
And also for me,

1733
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:26,203
what,
there's that thing that people do where 

1734
01:17:28,761 --> 01:17:33,360
they do have A.
I have a joke about it in my act about a

1735
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:34,203
register,
a study that said that sperm can cure 

1736
01:17:37,581 --> 01:17:38,414
depression in women.
And I slammed my laptop shut and I 

1737
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,460
didn't read another word.
I'm like,

1738
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:48,530
I've found the cure,
but this is me.

1739
01:17:48,690 --> 01:17:50,340
This is what the title.
Yeah.

1740
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:52,790
This is essentially what these people 
were doing.

1741
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:53,150
They,
they,

1742
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:56,900
they will read or risk oftentimes don't 
even read,

1743
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:57,913
but recite from someone else's,
reciting it in a video didn't read 

1744
01:18:02,601 --> 01:18:03,434
right,
which is what's going on with a lot of 

1745
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:06,200
this stuff and this is what I'm 
concerned with.

1746
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,880
I keep seeing all these people like,
Hey,

1747
01:18:07,881 --> 01:18:09,410
I'm going to try the carnivore die.
Hey,

1748
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,060
try the carnivore diet.
I tell you,

1749
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:14,000
it's amazing and I'm just sitting here 
shaking my head.

1750
01:18:14,001 --> 01:18:16,460
I'm like,
this doesn't make any sense.

1751
01:18:16,461 --> 01:18:17,294
Like,
I don't.

1752
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:18,283
Why would you want to eliminate a 
massive source of bioavailable 

1753
01:18:22,341 --> 01:18:23,630
nutrients?
Like,

1754
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,593
and then when they're talking about the 
negative consequences of consuming 

1755
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:28,994
vegetables,
that there's different sort of toxic 

1756
01:18:32,661 --> 01:18:33,494
elements.
I do remember you talking about how 

1757
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:39,500
these stressors can actually have a 
positive and beneficial result when your

1758
01:18:39,501 --> 01:18:41,310
body reacts to these stressors.
Yeah,

1759
01:18:41,311 --> 01:18:42,144
that's exactly how exercise works.
That's exactly a fasting works exactly 

1760
01:18:44,631 --> 01:18:48,320
how heat stress from the sauna work.
And it's how these phytochemicals.

1761
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:53,120
I'm calling phytochemicals just as like 
a generic category,

1762
01:18:53,121 --> 01:18:57,560
but they're are these compounds that are
made by plants to ward off insects.

1763
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,970
Um,
and,

1764
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,760
and,
uh,

1765
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,593
and we evolved eating them and they 
activate amazing stress response 

1766
01:19:03,501 --> 01:19:04,790
pathways in,
in humans,

1767
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:06,400
in our brain,
you know,

1768
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:07,880
in multiple in blood cells.

1769
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:08,713
I mean,
it's just human intervention trials 

1770
01:19:09,921 --> 01:19:13,310
showing this.
So you're going gonna miss out.

1771
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:14,823
We evolved with,
we're supposed to be stressed by 

1772
01:19:16,341 --> 01:19:17,174
exercise,
by fasting during the time restricted 

1773
01:19:18,951 --> 01:19:19,784
eating like that.
We're supposed to do that and we're 

1774
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:23,780
supposed to eat some plants I think 
they're trying to accomplish.

1775
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:24,683
They're trying to simplify something 
that's incredibly complicated and 

1776
01:19:27,591 --> 01:19:30,720
they're doing it with this sort of 
religious fervor is,

1777
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:34,010
is,
it's very strange and I can feel it when

1778
01:19:34,011 --> 01:19:37,880
I talk about it where people get upset,
they're getting upset at me,

1779
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:41,540
like I'm criticizing Jesus or something 
very weird.

1780
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,490
And again,
I'm not a Vegan.

1781
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,000
I eat lots of meat.
You know,

1782
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:51,560
you and I have had conversations about 
the importance of meat.

1783
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:53,120
Yeah.
So it's,

1784
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:54,410
it's,
it's,

1785
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:56,480
it's a religious thing.
It really is.

1786
01:19:56,481 --> 01:19:57,314
It's the same sort of mindset that 
allows people to get by just rabidly 

1787
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:06,950
republican or anything else like fill in
the blanks,

1788
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,130
whatever it is.
You know,

1789
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:09,700
there was a,
there's a,

1790
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:12,900
it's just a thing that people do theirs 
for the longest.

1791
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:15,960
There's two different camps in Jujitsu 
when you're something crazy,

1792
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:20,150
there's g and Nogi a gooey is the 
Kimono,

1793
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,050
this white or you know,
multicolor,

1794
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:23,310
you could wear it,
different colors now,

1795
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:27,780
but it started out with why and um,
a lot of people learn their Jujitsu,

1796
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:29,700
grabbing onto the geek,
you know,

1797
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:32,540
like sort of a Judogi or uh,
you know,

1798
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:37,500
Karate d and utilizing it as part of the
grappling technique.

1799
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:42,150
And then Nogi came along and would Nogi 
is they use rash guards,

1800
01:20:42,151 --> 01:20:42,984
they don't grab the clothes and they 
concentrate on control of the body with 

1801
01:20:45,571 --> 01:20:48,330
under hooks and over hooks and gable 
grips and things along those lines.

1802
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:52,320
And it became a religious battle between
D and Nogi.

1803
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:53,423
And I remember sitting there watching 
this and it was a problem because like 

1804
01:20:55,891 --> 01:20:56,760
people would get angry.

1805
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,780
What camp are you in,
Bro?

1806
01:20:57,781 --> 01:21:00,480
And I trained both.
I have a black belt in,

1807
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:03,000
I have a black belt Nogi.
I trained both of them.

1808
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:04,620
I think there's benefits to both of 
them,

1809
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,850
but there was this weird thing where you
were supposed to choose sides.

1810
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:12,480
It's since alleviated and people realize
how preposterous it is,

1811
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:15,630
but for a long time,
like four years,

1812
01:21:15,631 --> 01:21:16,464
the Jujitsu community was split where 
people were angry at people who are the 

1813
01:21:19,711 --> 01:21:23,190
gate or angry at people who were no gay.
Like my friend Eddie,

1814
01:21:23,191 --> 01:21:24,024
Eddie Bravo who teaches no gay people 
were angry at him for teaching a system 

1815
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:31,560
of Jujitsu that didn't involve a certain
type of clothing.

1816
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:32,543
It's the same mindset.
People just want you to believe what 

1817
01:21:35,551 --> 01:21:38,460
they believe only and they get rabid 
about it.

1818
01:21:38,461 --> 01:21:39,294
They get crazy and I'm seeing this with 
this carnivore diet and I think there's 

1819
01:21:42,571 --> 01:21:43,404
a psychological aspect of it to it that 
you were talking about when in terms of 

1820
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:51,480
this placebo effect that I think they 
feel like I've never felt better.

1821
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:53,760
I'm on this carnivore diet.
I'm doing chin ups.

1822
01:21:53,761 --> 01:21:54,594
I'm running around the block.
Like when you read about everyone 

1823
01:21:56,371 --> 01:22:00,270
feeling better and I want in,
I want to on this carnivore diet,

1824
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:02,160
and then there's also.
Well,

1825
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:06,510
if you are doing this as opposed to the 
standard American diet,

1826
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:07,463
I think you have the same sort of 
response that you have when people are 

1827
01:22:09,961 --> 01:22:12,300
talking about the positive benefits of 
the Vegan Diet.

1828
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:13,523
I think if you have a Po,
if you have a vegan diet in comparison 

1829
01:22:16,021 --> 01:22:18,510
to eating chips and fries and soda,
yeah,

1830
01:22:18,511 --> 01:22:21,000
you're going to feel fucking amazing and
people talk about it.

1831
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:24,630
It's just like they did the carnival and
they get and they want you to do.

1832
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:25,560
I mean,
there's pee.

1833
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,393
I'm seeing the same patterns that I see 
with vegans were these carnivore people 

1834
01:22:30,121 --> 01:22:32,910
are putting meat and their screen name,
you know,

1835
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:34,230
um,
mediator Mike,

1836
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:36,160
you know,
Carnivore Carl.

1837
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:39,300
There are other fucking crazy people.
They're doing the same thing that vegans

1838
01:22:39,301 --> 01:22:41,070
do with our,
on the Vegan warrior.

1839
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:43,140
I'm carnivores Carl,
you know,

1840
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,540
fuck you.
Planning poisoned and they're assholes.

1841
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:47,040
You don't even understand what you're 
doing to your body.

1842
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:49,740
And then because I like plants,
I like,

1843
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,720
you get thrown in and you can't.
You have to pick a camp.

1844
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,080
I'm not picking a cab.

1845
01:22:58,370 --> 01:22:59,203
I liked my Paleo Diet and I actually,
I'm probably going to try a little bit 

1846
01:23:01,621 --> 01:23:03,040
of Quito.
I'm gonna.

1847
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:04,800
I'm gonna Experiment.
They're a little bit too.

1848
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:06,400
So there's some great positive

1849
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,500
cognitive benefits for that.
I mean,

1850
01:23:08,501 --> 01:23:09,850
I've,
I've really experienced that.

1851
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:10,863
It's,
it's hard for me because what knocks me 

1852
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:12,874
out ironically,
but knocks me out of Ketosis with the 

1853
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:18,280
most of my diet is fairly ketogenic.
Sep,

1854
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,640
I eat too much meat.
Yeah,

1855
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:22,210
I crave it.
I'm always the guy to.

1856
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:23,110
Well,
I need,

1857
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:25,360
I think I need a lot.
I don't know,

1858
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:28,030
maybe I'm just full of Shit.
But uh,

1859
01:23:28,031 --> 01:23:29,800
I also have a lot because I,
you know,

1860
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:33,400
I hunt elk and shoot a 400 pound animal 
and good quality meat.

1861
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:34,720
It's the best.
Yeah.

1862
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:38,170
And I'll eat a fucking pound of it.
So I'm eating like,

1863
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:40,170
who knows how many grams of protein that
is.

1864
01:23:40,171 --> 01:23:42,940
It's something insane,
but I mean,

1865
01:23:42,941 --> 01:23:43,774
I don't think it's a placebo effect 
because I've been doing this for years 

1866
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:47,920
now.
I feel pretty fucking good,

1867
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:48,850
you know.
And um,

1868
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:50,530
we're doing this fitness challenge now.

1869
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:53,140
That's what this thing is.
Me and my friend,

1870
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:55,540
Bert Kreischer,
my friend Tom Seger in Arusha fear,

1871
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:56,374
we for the month,
we have to see who burns the most 

1872
01:23:59,531 --> 01:24:00,364
calories and gets the most maps.
This is my zone thing and I'm planning 

1873
01:24:03,821 --> 01:24:05,470
on killing those guys.
I'm planning.

1874
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,560
I'm literally having them try to die.
Keep up with me.

1875
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:10,140
Sober October.
Yeah,

1876
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:11,770
October.
It's going on right now.

1877
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:14,610
Is there.
Is there a hot yoga and sauna involved?

1878
01:24:14,611 --> 01:24:15,444
So I'm doing it.
Those pussies are just going to try to 

1879
01:24:16,571 --> 01:24:17,404
like go run around the block,
but I'm doing the 15 hot yogas plus I'm 

1880
01:24:22,121 --> 01:24:22,954
doing all sorts of the crate to one our 
hardcore cardio sessions yesterday and 

1881
01:24:27,911 --> 01:24:32,500
then today I'm going to do kickboxing 
for an hour and a half tomorrow.

1882
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:34,540
I'm going to do an hour and a half of 
yoga in the morning.

1883
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:35,374
Then I'm going to run at night too.
You definitely should eat more meat 

1884
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:38,390
more.

1885
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:41,740
I'm I'm planning.
I want these guys to break.

1886
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,030
That's awesome.
Break them.

1887
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:46,300
Burt burt's getting cockies posting 
stuff on instagram today.

1888
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,820
I talked to burt about some song.
He was real into the sauna.

1889
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:54,010
He's asking,
he's really into vodka and cheeseburgers

1890
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:56,800
that actually caused you to excrete 
micronutrients,

1891
01:24:56,801 --> 01:25:00,070
zinc and magnesium haven't.
Yeah,

1892
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:00,963
the,
the,

1893
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:03,280
you know what else it causes you to 
excrete jokes.

1894
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,473
That's part of the problem.
You Scott Damn hilarious when he's 

1895
01:25:05,951 --> 01:25:09,460
drunk.
It's a part of the problem.

1896
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:11,380
Know again,
balance.

1897
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:13,263
I think this is a very important 
conversation to have because I think 

1898
01:25:15,251 --> 01:25:16,084
there's a lot of people that are enticed
by the magic of this carnivore diet and 

1899
01:25:19,091 --> 01:25:19,924
I think uh,
I'm so happy that you or the one that 

1900
01:25:22,361 --> 01:25:23,194
can cause you can do it in such a 
scientific manner and just sort of 

1901
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:26,584
illuminated all the various problems and
sort of explain why they are 

1902
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:35,080
experiencing these benefits because even
brilliant man like Jordan Peterson,

1903
01:25:35,081 --> 01:25:35,914
he's a brilliant guy.
He is just accepting the positive 

1904
01:25:37,901 --> 01:25:41,140
benefits of this and I don't know how 
far he's looked into this.

1905
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:42,041
Yeah,
I,

1906
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:43,730
you know,
and also it's important like the,

1907
01:25:43,731 --> 01:25:44,370
the,
the,

1908
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:48,580
the fact that the no cbu thing 
experiencing bad things,

1909
01:25:48,581 --> 01:25:49,414
you know,
also things when you change your 

1910
01:25:50,231 --> 01:25:53,350
microbiome and you're going along period
of time or just eating meat.

1911
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,213
I mean it,
vegans that like eat me or people that 

1912
01:25:56,471 --> 01:25:59,980
are on a low fat diet that eat fat,
they experienced negative effects.

1913
01:25:59,981 --> 01:26:02,920
I mean because they're there,
our microbiome changes that do occur and

1914
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:06,320
lead to discomfort and those things will
eventually go away.

1915
01:26:06,321 --> 01:26:07,154
But that was also something to consider 
like so there may be a no seatbelt on 

1916
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:10,934
top of actual things that are short term
and that it's not just people that eat 

1917
01:26:15,081 --> 01:26:16,570
meat and then all of a sudden need some 
plans.

1918
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:17,990
So like I knew it,
you know,

1919
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,353
there,
there are changes that have takes some 

1920
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:21,404
time,
a little bit of time in the microbiome 

1921
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:25,850
that may be happening because you know,
definitely begins talking about the same

1922
01:26:25,851 --> 01:26:26,210
thing.

1923
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:28,100
People on a low fat that you eat a high 
fat diet,

1924
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:29,660
say the same thing.
I mean,

1925
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:30,980
so you know,
some,

1926
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:33,230
someone's got to be right.
Well maybe everyone's right.

1927
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:35,480
You know,
maybe there's a mechanism,

1928
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:38,110
the microbiome changes and everyone's 
right.

1929
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,790
Your body adjusts dependent upon your 
diet.

1930
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:41,361
What?
Yeah,

1931
01:26:41,361 --> 01:26:42,200
and that's,
it's been shown.

1932
01:26:42,201 --> 01:26:43,034
I mean,
the microbiome does change depending on 

1933
01:26:43,791 --> 01:26:45,010
your diet.
And you know,

1934
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:46,063
if you're,
if you're eating a low fat and then 

1935
01:26:47,031 --> 01:26:48,920
going to a high fat diet in that 
there's,

1936
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:49,600
you're,
you're,

1937
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,470
you're making bile acids and things like
that.

1938
01:26:51,471 --> 01:26:52,304
And you know,
if you don't have a microbiome that are 

1939
01:26:53,601 --> 01:26:54,434
resistant to that,
you can start to have microbiome being 

1940
01:26:56,181 --> 01:26:57,860
killed off and then it can cause 
inflammation.

1941
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:59,570
You know,
the going from the plant.

1942
01:26:59,571 --> 01:27:00,110
I mean,
you're,

1943
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:02,540
you're basically selecting for,
if you're eating a bunch of protein,

1944
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:04,220
you've got a lot of putrifactive 
bacteria,

1945
01:27:04,221 --> 01:27:06,080
maybe less of the other,
you know,

1946
01:27:06,081 --> 01:27:06,914
maybe it takes some time to be able to 
like ferment some of those complex 

1947
01:27:10,611 --> 01:27:12,350
carbohydrate fermentable fibers and 
stuff.

1948
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:15,920
So I think that there's the mechanism,
I mean,

1949
01:27:15,921 --> 01:27:17,570
it's not even easy to figure out 
mechanism,

1950
01:27:17,571 --> 01:27:21,200
but there's usually a mechanism and an 
explanation for these four things.

1951
01:27:21,201 --> 01:27:22,034
And you know,
sometimes you have a hypothesis and 

1952
01:27:23,301 --> 01:27:24,890
sometimes it's writing,
sometimes it's not.

1953
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,380
It doesn't mean what you're experiencing
isn't real,

1954
01:27:27,381 --> 01:27:28,214
just means that you don't,
you didn't understand why you're 

1955
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,710
experiencing,
you thought you did,

1956
01:27:30,711 --> 01:27:31,544
but you didn't Makilah Peterson.
So that when she first got on the 

1957
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:36,530
carnivores,
she had diarrhea for six solid weeks.

1958
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:39,500
Wow.
That would,

1959
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,390
uh,
push through it.

1960
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:42,920
That would,
no pun intended.

1961
01:27:42,921 --> 01:27:44,660
Shake me loose.
Wow.

1962
01:27:44,661 --> 01:27:45,950
It'd be like,
yeah,

1963
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:49,810
after about two weeks ago,
like I'm kinda tired of shit in my pants

1964
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,140
this six months.
A lot.

1965
01:27:54,141 --> 01:27:58,310
Yeah.
For her it was worth it in comparison to

1966
01:27:58,330 --> 01:27:59,030
the,
the,

1967
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:01,910
the,
the negative effects that she was having

1968
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,380
on her immune system.

1969
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,140
I mean,
yeah,

1970
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:06,020
you might want to talk to her about the 
fasting.

1971
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:07,190
I mean,
trying that.

1972
01:28:07,191 --> 01:28:09,070
If she's open minded,
you know,

1973
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:12,520
at the end of the day it's hard when 
someone's experiencing it is,

1974
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:15,800
it is hard and it is hard when they,
that's just,

1975
01:28:15,801 --> 01:28:17,060
you know,
I,

1976
01:28:17,061 --> 01:28:20,600
I get that.
But it also is important to realize that

1977
01:28:20,601 --> 01:28:21,434
this is,
there hasn't been proved that she's 

1978
01:28:24,651 --> 01:28:25,484
experiencing what she's experiencing 
because she's caught all plans out and 

1979
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,233
you know,
so at the end of the day there is no 

1980
01:28:32,241 --> 01:28:34,550
data.
So you can't say definitively,

1981
01:28:34,551 --> 01:28:37,580
but I mean there's a lot of data on,
you know,

1982
01:28:37,581 --> 01:28:40,070
why you should include some plants at 
least.

1983
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:42,230
And again,
if you're doing this for an autoimmune,

1984
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:44,590
there's a lot of really good data that 
fasting helps,

1985
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,010
like,
and not only helps,

1986
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:48,740
it helps you age,
like I'm going to start doing just like,

1987
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,430
you know,
some,

1988
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:50,263
some fast,
like couple times a year once I've 

1989
01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:54,800
completely weaned my son how many days 
so,

1990
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:55,833
so a prolonged fast take,
but I'm technically in humans according 

1991
01:28:58,431 --> 01:29:00,080
to Dr Valter Longo,
he,

1992
01:29:00,081 --> 01:29:02,370
um,
he thinks that it has to be more than 48

1993
01:29:02,371 --> 01:29:05,850
hours,
so you can do like a 72 hour fast and my

1994
01:29:05,851 --> 01:29:08,310
inlaws have been doing,
they've done like a couple of three,

1995
01:29:08,311 --> 01:29:09,144
three and a half day fast and they're 
getting all sorts of massive 

1996
01:29:10,951 --> 01:29:15,951
improvements in a variety of biomarkers,
a Lipid and glucose and inflammation.

1997
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:18,083
You know,
a lot of things that I know carnivore 

1998
01:29:18,991 --> 01:29:21,390
people are talking about as well,
but could be getting the same thing with

1999
01:29:21,391 --> 01:29:22,340
fasting.
Um,

2000
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,333
you're doing this.
Are you limiting the amount of exercise 

2001
01:29:25,261 --> 01:29:26,670
you do?
Some people do.

2002
01:29:26,671 --> 01:29:28,200
It depends on how you feel.
I mean,

2003
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:29,490
you know,
you certainly,

2004
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:33,330
I think that if you're doing,
if you're not eating any food and you're

2005
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:35,390
just doing like a water fast,
um,

2006
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:36,293
you certainly could be more dangerous 
and should listen to your body and if 

2007
01:29:39,031 --> 01:29:40,860
you feel really sick or your heart's 
racing,

2008
01:29:40,861 --> 01:29:41,694
I think they just need to eat.
You mean something that like I wouldn't 

2009
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:47,970
just willy nilly doing as opposed to 
what other kinds of things.

2010
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:50,880
The fact there's a fasting mimicking 
diet where people can.

2011
01:29:50,881 --> 01:29:51,714
This is something valter Longo has 
published on in humans and study humans 

2012
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:57,870
as well as animal data where it's like a
very,

2013
01:29:58,170 --> 01:29:59,003
you know,
like the first day it's like a thousand 

2014
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:00,594
calories and the second through fifth 
day it's like 700 calories and then 

2015
01:30:04,561 --> 01:30:06,840
they're broken up where it's like the 
first day it's like,

2016
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:09,990
it's very much a low sugar,
low protein,

2017
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,290
high fat,
modest carb kind of diet.

2018
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:15,060
So what are the pros of that you 
consume?

2019
01:30:15,061 --> 01:30:16,440
Like nuts and not.
Yeah,

2020
01:30:16,441 --> 01:30:17,274
he,
well he's got like a package kind of 

2021
01:30:18,181 --> 01:30:20,070
thing that people like can be 
prescribed,

2022
01:30:20,071 --> 01:30:22,350
like a physician can prescribe it to a 
patient,

2023
01:30:22,351 --> 01:30:23,770
you know.
But um,

2024
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:24,540
um,
you can,

2025
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:27,780
you can sort of make your own as well 
with whole foods,

2026
01:30:27,781 --> 01:30:28,490
you know,
like,

2027
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:31,170
oh,
like an avocado some.

2028
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:34,440
Yeah.
But you have to sort of keep the calorie

2029
01:30:34,441 --> 01:30:37,110
cap so make sure you're not getting too 
many calories.

2030
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,510
That's kind of important as well.
And you do that for five days.

2031
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:43,340
What is the standard avocado oil avocado
contains terms of calorie?

2032
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:44,443
No,
no,

2033
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:45,650
no.
Um,

2034
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:46,531
so,
but yeah,

2035
01:30:46,531 --> 01:30:47,364
you can do like,
like you could definitely do like an 

2036
01:30:48,571 --> 01:30:49,404
avocado if it's like the whole day.
And then some people have sort of done 

2037
01:30:52,501 --> 01:30:53,334
modified versions of it as well,
like where it's a little more key to 

2038
01:30:55,021 --> 01:30:55,854
genic the,
they've adjusted the carbohydrate and 

2039
01:30:57,871 --> 01:30:59,760
fat to be a little more of the 
ketogenic.

2040
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:00,803
And like I said,
I'm the study that was published in 

2041
01:31:03,841 --> 01:31:06,480
parallel with a fasting mimicking diet 
study,

2042
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:09,210
the fasting mimicking diet they did for 
three months,

2043
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:11,460
but it was only one week that did the 
fasting mimicking diet.

2044
01:31:11,461 --> 01:31:12,294
So that the other part or the three 
months they were eating a Mediterranean 

2045
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:16,493
diet,
the other people in which was in 

2046
01:31:18,271 --> 01:31:19,130
Germany,
um,

2047
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:20,183
they were on a ketogenic diet and they 
were on it for three months and they 

2048
01:31:21,751 --> 01:31:26,751
experienced improvements as well.
So there's definitely ways to tweak it.

2049
01:31:28,591 --> 01:31:31,500
And actually the out getting to the 
Alzheimer's.

2050
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:32,920
Um,
the,

2051
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:33,800
the,
the,

2052
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,790
the guy that I interviewed,
Dr Dale Bredesen,

2053
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:37,770
um,
he,

2054
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:40,770
he is published extensively and also as 
clinical,

2055
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:41,663
a lot of clinical experience where he's,
he's trying to understand the mechanism 

2056
01:31:44,251 --> 01:31:45,084
of Alzheimer's disease and I'm getting 
to this for the Ketogenic is going to 

2057
01:31:47,731 --> 01:31:51,090
come back eventually.
But so he,

2058
01:31:51,091 --> 01:31:51,924
he tries to understand a lot of the 
underlying mechanisms for Alzheimer's 

2059
01:31:54,121 --> 01:31:54,900
disease.

2060
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:55,733
And in his clinical experience he sort 
of sees there's subtypes of where you 

2061
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:03,700
can get like patients that have a really
high inflammatory where they've got lots

2062
01:32:03,701 --> 01:32:05,880
of inflammatory biomarkers.
Um,

2063
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:10,040
they also have high fasting blood 
glucose in there.

2064
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:11,230
Little like,
you know,

2065
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:12,173
a high fasting insulin,
but then you can get the same sort of 

2066
01:32:14,891 --> 01:32:15,724
metabolic effect where you have people 
that are kind of on the insulin 

2067
01:32:18,461 --> 01:32:19,294
resistant Spectra,
but without inflammation there's that 

2068
01:32:22,031 --> 01:32:22,864
subtype.
And then there's like another subtype 

2069
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:24,473
where it's like,
it seems like a big environmental 

2070
01:32:25,511 --> 01:32:26,344
component like toxic stuff people are 
being exposed to and that leads to a 

2071
01:32:29,471 --> 01:32:32,280
much,
much earlier diagnosis and Alzheimer and

2072
01:32:32,330 --> 01:32:34,650
sort of different phenotype.
But um,

2073
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:35,943
he has this really aggressive and very 
thorough protocol that's like on the 

2074
01:32:40,361 --> 01:32:41,850
individual level where people,
you know,

2075
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:44,680
he has tons and tons of biomarkers that 
are measured.

2076
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:45,903
One is the fasting blood glucose,
so she'd be less than five point five 

2077
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:49,840
actually gets Hba,
one C,

2078
01:32:49,841 --> 01:32:50,674
which is a three month mark or a fasting
blood glucose should be less than five 

2079
01:32:52,961 --> 01:32:53,794
point five.
Fasting insulin should be less than 

2080
01:32:55,031 --> 01:32:56,130
seven.
Um,

2081
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,033
he's got your high sensitivity.
C reactive protein should be less than 

2082
01:32:59,111 --> 01:32:59,944
point eight.
And then he has a variety of other 

2083
01:33:01,271 --> 01:33:02,980
inflammatory biomarkers that are also 
measured.

2084
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:05,500
Um,
and a variety of other things.

2085
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:07,300
He looks at a lot of different 
micronutrients.

2086
01:33:07,301 --> 01:33:08,134
He looks at a homocysteine,
homocysteine is really important 

2087
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:11,500
because,
um,

2088
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:16,110
there's publications showing that if you
lower homocysteine it cannot enact.

2089
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:18,400
He actually published this in one 
patient.

2090
01:33:18,401 --> 01:33:21,430
It reversed the hippocampal atrophy,
which is kind of amazing.

2091
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:22,361
So there,
you know,

2092
01:33:22,361 --> 01:33:24,250
it's not really knowing exactly what the
mechanism is,

2093
01:33:24,251 --> 01:33:25,084
but,
so that's something he looks at and he 

2094
01:33:26,291 --> 01:33:27,250
does this diet.

2095
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:30,880
I'm this like diet,
this whole lifestyle change.

2096
01:33:30,881 --> 01:33:31,714
I mean people improving sleep exercise 
and he gives them all sorts of vitamins 

2097
01:33:34,211 --> 01:33:35,560
and fish oil.
But on top of that,

2098
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:36,723
he's this diet that he is Kinda like to 
lower the inflammation and improve the 

2099
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:42,213
insulin sensitivity and blood glucose 
and all that where he puts them on a 

2100
01:33:44,861 --> 01:33:47,260
diet that's kind of like,
he calls it Quito flags,

2101
01:33:47,261 --> 01:33:49,570
but it's Kinda like a,
a key to genic diet,

2102
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,433
modified ketogenic diet.
But a lot of the fats are coming from 

2103
01:33:52,991 --> 01:33:55,180
like plants versus.
So like avocado,

2104
01:33:55,181 --> 01:33:56,710
nuts,
olive oil,

2105
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:59,650
he treats me as a condiment.
Um,

2106
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,030
but,
um,

2107
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:02,103
and,
and basically is getting improvements 

2108
01:34:03,551 --> 01:34:05,050
like with,
with this type of diet,

2109
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,420
lowering inflammation,
proving all sorts of metabolic things.

2110
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:09,670
Um,
so it's really,

2111
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:10,970
it's really interesting,
I've,

2112
01:34:10,971 --> 01:34:12,270
I've read a lot of his studies because 
he,

2113
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:15,610
he publishes a lot on Alzheimer's 
disease and mechanisms,

2114
01:34:15,611 --> 01:34:16,660
you know,
and he's,

2115
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:19,120
he's got a book out as well where he'd 
kind of goes in depth about it.

2116
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:21,140
Um,
so it,

2117
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:23,200
it,
it certainly seems very interesting that

2118
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:24,510
he's,
he's actually been able to,

2119
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:25,383
to,
to not only like delay Alzheimer's 

2120
01:34:27,281 --> 01:34:28,240
disease,
but reverse it.

2121
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:29,074
And this is Paul.
He has published a couple of published 

2122
01:34:30,791 --> 01:34:34,660
studies where people were able to go 
back to work and actually,

2123
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,560
um,
in some of the,

2124
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:36,513
in some cases their brain atrophy,
a kind of stopped and it started to 

2125
01:34:39,911 --> 01:34:42,400
reverse where they were like growing 
more neurons.

2126
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:43,330
Wow.
Yeah.

2127
01:34:43,331 --> 01:34:44,164
So,
and I talked to him about this and so 

2128
01:34:45,611 --> 01:34:47,890
the publication was like the original 
one I had read,

2129
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:50,380
which got me interested in his work in 
the first place.

2130
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,430
When I saw that,
I was like,

2131
01:34:51,431 --> 01:34:52,660
holy crap,
this is amazing.

2132
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:54,880
It was only on 10 patients.
It was kind of low.

2133
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,920
He says,
now he's got like 50 more that there.

2134
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:58,853
He's getting ready to publish and then 
he's got this whole protocol where 

2135
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:03,270
there's like just,
he's got like thousands of,

2136
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:04,173
of,
of patients where they're like kind of 

2137
01:35:04,761 --> 01:35:06,290
treating this sort of individual way.

2138
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:07,333
They do genetic testing,
blood testing and all that stuff as 

2139
01:35:08,691 --> 01:35:09,830
well.
So,

2140
01:35:09,831 --> 01:35:11,930
um,
it's very interesting because it's,

2141
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:12,530
you know,
he's,

2142
01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:15,620
he's basically showing the important 
interaction between diet,

2143
01:35:15,621 --> 01:35:20,621
lifestyle and potentially genetics.
And this is kind of where my paper comes

2144
01:35:21,141 --> 01:35:24,130
in because,
um,

2145
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:25,013
there is a,
there is a gene that increases the risk 

2146
01:35:28,641 --> 01:35:30,500
for Alzheimer's if you have one copy of 
it.

2147
01:35:30,501 --> 01:35:32,810
So you get two copies of every gene from
one from mom,

2148
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:33,644
one from dad,
if you have one copy of it or increases 

2149
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:37,610
your risk for Alzheimer's disease by 
like two to three fold,

2150
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:38,503
you have two copies.
It can be anywhere between 10 and 15 

2151
01:35:39,831 --> 01:35:41,210
fold.
So it's like,

2152
01:35:41,211 --> 01:35:42,044
really,
it's called April before it also 

2153
01:35:43,431 --> 01:35:44,840
increases the,
the,

2154
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:48,650
your chances of having a really poor 
outcome if you have any type of Tbi,

2155
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,200
um,
and people with that that,

2156
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:51,830
um,
uh,

2157
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:52,663
Lele and have Tbi,
multiple tbis definitely are much more 

2158
01:35:56,541 --> 01:35:58,970
likely to come down with some sort of 
disease.

2159
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:00,500
So,
um,

2160
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:02,330
but not everyone with it gets it.
So there's like this,

2161
01:36:02,331 --> 01:36:03,860
like what's going on here,
you know,

2162
01:36:03,861 --> 01:36:05,480
there's,
there seems to be this clear,

2163
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:08,180
you know,
gene environment interaction going on.

2164
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:09,850
And so,
um,

2165
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:11,290
I,
I,

2166
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,133
uh,
was really interested in this because I 

2167
01:36:13,311 --> 01:36:14,144
found out I had one of these illegals 
and of course that got me really 

2168
01:36:17,241 --> 01:36:18,740
concerned.
I'm,

2169
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:19,663
one of the things that's really,
really important is sleep because sleep 

2170
01:36:22,221 --> 01:36:25,520
is one of the ways you actually clear 
away amyloid plaques from your brain.

2171
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:28,320
Your brain actually swells during sleep.
Um,

2172
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:29,183
you,
you squirt cerebral spinal fluid into 

2173
01:36:31,071 --> 01:36:31,904
your brain and you basically clean out 
amyloid plaques and a bunch of other 

2174
01:36:34,311 --> 01:36:38,090
gunk that's built up carwash for your 
brain when you sleep.

2175
01:36:38,150 --> 01:36:39,050
Yeah.
And,

2176
01:36:39,051 --> 01:36:39,884
um,
I talked about this with a former guest 

2177
01:36:40,851 --> 01:36:42,800
here is Dr Matt Walker.
We talked about it a lot.

2178
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:44,990
He's like him and I were to,
it was awesome.

2179
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:45,570
I,
I just,

2180
01:36:45,570 --> 01:36:47,270
I could have talked to who's a 
mindblower oh yeah.

2181
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:48,440
I love,
I love it.

2182
01:36:48,830 --> 01:36:49,663
Um,
I really loved the conversation I had 

2183
01:36:51,351 --> 01:36:55,760
with him so we talked about this in 
detail because I'm basically,

2184
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:59,360
that is one of the major ways you clear 
amyloid plaques,

2185
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:04,361
but the other way is through an Api we 
mediated mechanism and April we for um,

2186
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:09,020
does it like 20 fold less efficiently 
than someone that doesn't have it.

2187
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,073
And so they rely on sleep and there's 
all sorts of studies with April before 

2188
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:13,483
showing sleep is a major modifiable risk
factor for Alzheimer's disease if you 

2189
01:37:18,141 --> 01:37:20,510
have a boy before,
but you're getting good quality sleep,

2190
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:23,090
you have like the same risk as someone 
that doesn't have it.

2191
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,650
And so I was like,
Gee,

2192
01:37:24,651 --> 01:37:25,484
you know,
of course I was thinking about this the 

2193
01:37:26,081 --> 01:37:29,510
entire time that had my son and I was 
like not sleeping from us.

2194
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,080
But anyways.
Um,

2195
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:33,290
the other thing that I looked into in my
publication,

2196
01:37:33,291 --> 01:37:34,330
and this is where,
um,

2197
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:35,833
the,
another sort of diet gene interaction 

2198
01:37:37,431 --> 01:37:38,264
comes in,
is that there's all sorts of clinical 

2199
01:37:39,741 --> 01:37:40,574
studies showing that people with Apl,
we for benefit from fish eating fish 

2200
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:47,840
where they can basically have improved 
pathology in their brain,

2201
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:51,150
have improved symptoms of dementia,
um,

2202
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,033
but when they take fish oil,
if you take fish oil and give it to two 

2203
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:56,910
people with dementia,
only the people without April,

2204
01:37:56,911 --> 01:38:00,300
we for benefit for some reason the April
before people aren't benefiting.

2205
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:04,500
And if you look into the literature,
animals that were given human apl,

2206
01:38:04,501 --> 01:38:05,334
we for versus Human April way three,
the Dha doesn't get transported across 

2207
01:38:10,141 --> 01:38:13,760
the blood brain barrier very well with,
uh,

2208
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,240
April before.
So it's like,

2209
01:38:15,241 --> 01:38:16,074
what's going on?
There's some sort of transport defect 

2210
01:38:17,431 --> 01:38:19,170
and Dha in the brain is really 
important.

2211
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:21,930
It's been shown to play an important 
role in human studies,

2212
01:38:21,931 --> 01:38:24,290
but a lot of animal studies and human 
studies that have been shown to,

2213
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:27,660
to increase amyloid clearance.
Uh,

2214
01:38:27,661 --> 01:38:28,494
it's in humans.
It's been shown to decrease the Tau 

2215
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,430
Tangles.
And also,

2216
01:38:32,431 --> 01:38:34,290
it's really important for,
um,

2217
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:37,470
glucose uptake into the brain because it
regulates the transporters,

2218
01:38:37,471 --> 01:38:39,190
glucose transporters.
What was the second thing?

2219
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:40,860
Tau.
Tau Tangles.

2220
01:38:40,861 --> 01:38:45,540
So Tau Tangles form inside of neurons 
and they disrupt,

2221
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:46,433
um,
a process that's called microtubule 

2222
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,210
transport,
which is where basically it's,

2223
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:52,103
it's the,
it's the neuron system for transporting 

2224
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:55,650
fatty acids,
um,

2225
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:58,240
all sorts of goodies energy to the,
uh,

2226
01:38:58,290 --> 01:39:00,600
to the synapse or synaptic transitions 
happening.

2227
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:03,390
And Tau tangles basically disrupt that 
whole thing.

2228
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:08,870
Amyloid plaques form outside of neurons 
and the extracellular space and they can

2229
01:39:09,271 --> 01:39:10,104
disrupt synapse formation,
they're thought to form as a protective 

2230
01:39:14,101 --> 01:39:17,490
mechanism against viral,
fungal or bacterial infection.

2231
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:18,940
So it's Kinda like,
um,

2232
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,213
you know,
that that's the reason why they're 

2233
01:39:20,671 --> 01:39:21,504
forming,
but it's just a matter of clearing them 

2234
01:39:22,741 --> 01:39:25,980
out and also how your,
how your brain is able to like deal with

2235
01:39:25,981 --> 01:39:29,310
amyloid plaque burden and April we is 
not able to deal with it very well.

2236
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:30,783
Uh,
so the Dha transport thing is basically 

2237
01:39:33,241 --> 01:39:34,500
what I,
what I published is,

2238
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:35,353
is,
has to do with the interaction between 

2239
01:39:37,230 --> 01:39:39,000
different forms of Dha and EPA.
We,

2240
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:40,083
um,
there's two different ways that Dha is 

2241
01:39:41,431 --> 01:39:42,264
transported across the brain.
One is when it's like in a free fatty 

2242
01:39:44,551 --> 01:39:47,850
acid form,
it's bound to albumin and it requires an

2243
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:49,720
intact blood brain barrier,
uh,

2244
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:53,160
specifically the outer membrane of the 
blood brain barrier needs to be intact.

2245
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:54,383
And,
um,

2246
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,700
and because it goes through passive 
diffusion,

2247
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:57,743
well,
if there's a disruption in the blood 

2248
01:39:59,011 --> 01:39:59,844
brain barrier,
then the Gha isn't going to be 

2249
01:40:00,781 --> 01:40:02,610
transporting very well in that form.

2250
01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:03,983
Um,
and it's been shown that April before 

2251
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:07,493
actually disrupts that very thing,
the outer membrane of the tight 

2252
01:40:09,811 --> 01:40:13,230
junctions that bind the outer membrane 
of the endothelial cells that line,

2253
01:40:13,231 --> 01:40:15,150
the blood brain barrier.
And so,

2254
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:16,320
um,
it's,

2255
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:21,350
it's quite possible that that is why Dha
is not getting into the brains very well

2256
01:40:21,421 --> 01:40:22,141
in April.
We,

2257
01:40:22,141 --> 01:40:22,974
for carriers,
there's another way to get it in and 

2258
01:40:24,511 --> 01:40:25,344
this is through a transporter that,
that uses something called 

2259
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:28,254
Lysophosphatidylcholine Dha,
which is a fossil liquid form of Dha 

2260
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,450
forms from phosphatidylcholine,
Dha,

2261
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:39,030
the transporters called Mfs Dta.
And it basically takes the Dha and flips

2262
01:40:39,031 --> 01:40:40,770
it down,
uh,

2263
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:41,963
across the outer membrane,
into the inner membrane of the blood 

2264
01:40:43,681 --> 01:40:44,514
brain barrier,
so it bypasses that outer membrane and 

2265
01:40:45,781 --> 01:40:47,760
then it gets transported in.
So,

2266
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,073
um,
if you look at animal studies that you 

2267
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:54,550
delete that transporter,
like 60 percent of the Dha,

2268
01:40:54,551 --> 01:40:55,270
Dha is,
you know,

2269
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:57,700
not getting into the brain if you give,
give animals,

2270
01:40:57,701 --> 01:40:59,590
Dha humans with,
um,

2271
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:00,483
with,
uh,

2272
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:03,250
a variation in that gene that makes it 
less,

2273
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:05,520
less active,
have get neurodegenerative,

2274
01:41:05,521 --> 01:41:08,560
a form of neurological disorders and 
neurodegenerative disorders.

2275
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:10,890
So it's obviously very important,
um,

2276
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:11,730
you know,
to,

2277
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:12,563
to,
to get Dha into the brain through that 

2278
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,310
mechanism.
Well,

2279
01:41:15,311 --> 01:41:19,360
it turns out if you consume Dha in 
phospholipid form,

2280
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:23,890
you actually form more of 
Lysophosphatidylcholine Dha.

2281
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:29,260
And that's because basically where the 
djs are on a,

2282
01:41:29,261 --> 01:41:30,190
on a Phospho,
Libya,

2283
01:41:30,191 --> 01:41:31,024
they're in multiple carbons and one of 
them can escape a lipase in the 

2284
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:35,493
pancreas.
And so basically you can form more of 

2285
01:41:36,761 --> 01:41:37,594
it.
Okay.

2286
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:40,840
But um,
so for fossil liquid form djs and fish,

2287
01:41:41,230 --> 01:41:44,390
but it's really abundant in fish roe,
like super abundant,

2288
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:48,910
like 30 slash 70 percent of Dha that's 
found in fish roe,

2289
01:41:48,911 --> 01:41:53,140
which are fish eggs,
a variety of different kinds,

2290
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:54,363
um,
are impossible liquid form and you 

2291
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:57,480
consume that stuff.
You,

2292
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,380
that's the reason why I want to get to 
talk about it.

2293
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:00,530
Um,
I order my.

2294
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:02,530
So you can like,
I get Salmon Roe,

2295
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:04,990
I like the salmon because it also has 
asked us anthon in it,

2296
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,100
which is you order it.

2297
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:09,350
Like is it bottled or canned or frozen?
Frozen.

2298
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:10,690
It's frozen.
I order it.

2299
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,270
But you can go into like a Japanese 
store,

2300
01:42:13,271 --> 01:42:15,850
you can get flying fish roe,
which are much.

2301
01:42:15,851 --> 01:42:18,520
Some people prefer those because they're
smaller and the texture,

2302
01:42:18,521 --> 01:42:20,850
they don't like the Salmon Roe,
like the occur.

2303
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,870
If you go to a Sushi restaurant and you 
get like the,

2304
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:27,070
like the shakes that come in like the 
seaweed or have a bigger,

2305
01:42:27,071 --> 01:42:29,140
bigger,
they're bigger and they kind of know how

2306
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:30,760
to use those for Bait.
Yeah.

2307
01:42:30,761 --> 01:42:31,594
Some people don't like them because it's
like squish it and it's like liquid 

2308
01:42:34,691 --> 01:42:36,880
coming.
Great for catching rainbow trout,

2309
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:39,040
rainbow trout,
rainbow trout,

2310
01:42:39,041 --> 01:42:39,970
eat salmon,
eggs.

2311
01:42:40,630 --> 01:42:42,340
So I'm,
so I'm basically,

2312
01:42:42,341 --> 01:42:43,510
you know,
that's,

2313
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:45,970
that's one way to get more phospholipid 
form,

2314
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:49,630
but also Dha consumed in like 
triglyceride form,

2315
01:42:49,631 --> 01:42:51,910
which is what a lot of fish oil is also 
forms.

2316
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:54,280
It also forms Dha 
Lysophosphatidylcholine,

2317
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:58,330
but you just need more of it.
So it's also possible that some of these

2318
01:42:58,331 --> 01:43:00,280
clinical trials showing that,
you know,

2319
01:43:00,330 --> 01:43:01,163
fish oil failed was because they were 
using like the dose they were using was 

2320
01:43:04,001 --> 01:43:06,250
two grams.
So maybe you need six rams.

2321
01:43:06,251 --> 01:43:07,084
Maybe you need for.
Is there any negative benefits or the 

2322
01:43:09,011 --> 01:43:11,710
negative consequences of consuming too 
much fish oil?

2323
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:12,950
Well,
I think,

2324
01:43:12,950 --> 01:43:13,783
you know,
certainly depends on the type of fish 

2325
01:43:15,311 --> 01:43:16,144
oil that you're consuming.
You're consuming oxidized fish oils and 

2326
01:43:19,121 --> 01:43:19,954
certainly not very good,
but why would it be oxidized if it's 

2327
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:25,000
last,
if it's too old,

2328
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:27,490
it's too old and depending on how they 
ice,

2329
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,410
how,
what the isolation process was,

2330
01:43:29,411 --> 01:43:30,790
but yeah,
too old for sure.

2331
01:43:30,791 --> 01:43:34,210
Things that are sitting around a 
purification process is very important.

2332
01:43:34,211 --> 01:43:35,920
The purification.
Yes.

2333
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:37,000
Yes.
Very important.

2334
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:37,863
And like I said,
there's that fish oil standards program 

2335
01:43:39,971 --> 01:43:40,804
you can look up and there's a variety of
different fish oil supplement brands 

2336
01:43:43,361 --> 01:43:44,194
that are on there.

2337
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:47,470
The other thing is like they was just 
recently a randomized,

2338
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:48,333
very,
very large randomized controlled trial 

2339
01:43:49,421 --> 01:43:50,254
published on four grams of one of the 
omega three fatty acids found in fish 

2340
01:43:55,401 --> 01:43:58,850
and other marine organisms,
EPA and they were given four grams a day

2341
01:43:58,851 --> 01:44:00,290
for five years.
8,000

2342
01:44:00,291 --> 01:44:01,610
patients,
randomized,

2343
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:05,660
placebo controlled different countries 
and it reduced.

2344
01:44:05,661 --> 01:44:09,110
And these actually were patients that 
had hypertrophic high triglycerides.

2345
01:44:09,111 --> 01:44:09,944
And also we're on Stanton's,
it lowered cardiovascular disease risk 

2346
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:19,760
by like 28 or 30 percent or something 
like that,

2347
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:21,183
you know.
So that was a high dose and that was 

2348
01:44:21,801 --> 01:44:24,740
five years long.
Pretty pretty long followup.

2349
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,960
And it was a randomized placebo 
controlled study.

2350
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:30,140
Um,
I think it was called the vitals,

2351
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,920
it bitlead study.
Um,

2352
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:34,153
but you know,
the other thing that I think people are 

2353
01:44:35,211 --> 01:44:38,500
worried about with really high dose fish
oil is um,

2354
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:39,463
the potential for blood thinning because
it does inhibit thromboxanes and 

2355
01:44:43,071 --> 01:44:43,904
prostoglandins and leukotrienes,
leukotrienes and things that are 

2356
01:44:45,621 --> 01:44:46,910
important for like,
you know,

2357
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:48,133
clotting.

2358
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,210
Um,
you know,

2359
01:44:50,211 --> 01:44:54,740
I've been taking a really high dose for 
like over a decade,

2360
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,170
you know,
official I've been taking not always six

2361
01:44:57,171 --> 01:44:58,004
grams,
but I've been taking a high dose for 

2362
01:44:59,181 --> 01:45:00,014
quite a while.
How often do you get your blood work 

2363
01:45:01,161 --> 01:45:01,994
done?
Well recently I haven't been getting it 

2364
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:04,214
done very often because I'm the 
pregnancy and breastfeeding and Cicero 

2365
01:45:07,461 --> 01:45:08,294
changes things.
I try to do it like it ideally like 

2366
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:14,150
doing it once a quarter,
but like a couple times a year for sure.

2367
01:45:14,590 --> 01:45:17,070
I'm probably troy six months.
That's,

2368
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:18,590
that's good.
I think.

2369
01:45:18,591 --> 01:45:19,790
I think like,
you know,

2370
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,700
sometimes you can get super obsessive by
doing,

2371
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:24,380
if you're doing it like once a quarter,
you know,

2372
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:25,693
for people that are not healthy,
I think doing it once a quarter until 

2373
01:45:27,771 --> 01:45:29,220
they start to get healthier.
Yeah.

2374
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:32,640
Got It all dialed in to supplement with 
Niacin at all.

2375
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:36,320
No,
I don't supplement with nice and um,

2376
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:40,160
but I'm thinking about doing the 
nicotinamide riboside,

2377
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:40,921
you know,
Nice.

2378
01:45:40,921 --> 01:45:45,921
And Ken that's been shown to like lower 
ldl and they get hired at the stuff that

2379
01:45:46,311 --> 01:45:47,810
causes the flushing.
Right.

2380
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:48,853
The stuff that causes a flushing,
but also I think that there were some 

2381
01:45:50,571 --> 01:45:53,510
problems with it,
like disrupting insulin,

2382
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,510
something with insulin secretion.
I don't recall.

2383
01:45:56,511 --> 01:45:58,640
It's been like so many years since I've 
read those studies.

2384
01:45:59,150 --> 01:45:59,983
But um,
the nicotine nicotinamide riboside 

2385
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:05,140
beside forms Nad so Niacin is a 
precursor for,

2386
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:05,993
for Nad,
which is I'm also increased during 

2387
01:46:08,241 --> 01:46:08,920
fasting.

2388
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:10,900
We were going to get an,
a d,

2389
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:13,330
a ivy injections.
We still got to do that.

2390
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:15,460
Jeremy,
that company contacted us.

2391
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,140
They,
there's two ways of doing it.

2392
01:46:17,141 --> 01:46:18,950
One,
it takes eight hours or two,

2393
01:46:18,951 --> 01:46:23,951
it takes like 10 to 15 minutes and it's 
excruciating pain.

2394
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:25,170
It's excruciating.
Yeah,

2395
01:46:25,180 --> 01:46:26,290
they push it.
Yeah.

2396
01:46:26,291 --> 01:46:27,124
They push it through and it's just your 
guts feel like they're on fire for like 

2397
01:46:30,671 --> 01:46:31,504
10 minutes.
I want to try that just to see how bad 

2398
01:46:33,251 --> 01:46:36,370
it is because I want to stay a long 
time.

2399
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:37,630
Yeah.
I don't have eight hours.

2400
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:40,510
That's not happening.
I'm not sitting around for eight hours,

2401
01:46:40,810 --> 01:46:45,610
but apparently there's some significant 
benefits to ivy versions of it and doing

2402
01:46:45,611 --> 01:46:46,444
it.
A Ben Greenfield was on the podcast 

2403
01:46:47,531 --> 01:46:49,740
talking about it pretty much a pretty in
depth.

2404
01:46:49,741 --> 01:46:50,040
Yeah.

2405
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,570
He's a big believer of it.
Yeah.

2406
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:52,404
I couldn't find.
I actually tried finding some published 

2407
01:46:53,851 --> 01:46:57,870
studies on the Ivy version.
I really couldn't find any.

2408
01:46:58,110 --> 01:46:58,943
I take the time to.
I'm pretty sure it was recommended that 

2409
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:03,270
you recommended it to me.
Yeah,

2410
01:47:03,271 --> 01:47:05,010
I subscribed to that.
I get that stuff every day.

2411
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:07,350
So that's um,
and there have been published studies,

2412
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:09,960
clinical studies in humans on that,
but I take that stuff every day.

2413
01:47:09,961 --> 01:47:10,794
I like it.
Yeah.

2414
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:11,670
But,
uh,

2415
01:47:11,670 --> 01:47:12,503
I guess,
I don't know a lot of things I don't 

2416
01:47:14,191 --> 01:47:15,510
really know.
But um,

2417
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:16,373
the NAD by intravenous method,
it's supposed to be a much more potent 

2418
01:47:18,841 --> 01:47:19,674
form of it.
And the people that I know that have 

2419
01:47:21,031 --> 01:47:22,740
tried it,
like the guys at on it,

2420
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:25,170
they get a,
someone will come down to there,

2421
01:47:25,470 --> 01:47:26,303
the onnit labs like a couple times a 
month and a bunch of the employees will 

2422
01:47:30,421 --> 01:47:31,920
sign up and get zapped.

2423
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:33,463
So I wonder why some of these guys don't
start gathering data and start 

2424
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:38,140
publishing because it'd be nice to.
Yeah.

2425
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:41,430
To would be to see some data on that.
Yeah.

2426
01:47:41,431 --> 01:47:44,430
I wonder why,
you know,

2427
01:47:44,450 --> 01:47:46,970
a lot of times it's hard to get funding 
for some of these things.

2428
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:48,440
[inaudible],
you know,

2429
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:49,303
who knows.
I mean it'd be interesting to see if it 

2430
01:47:50,211 --> 01:47:51,044
has some of the similar benefits at 
taking something like nicotinamide 

2431
01:47:53,001 --> 01:47:56,300
riboside has where if you take like a 
high enough dose you can,

2432
01:47:56,330 --> 01:47:59,060
you can raise your,
your nad levels like dramatically.

2433
01:47:59,120 --> 01:47:59,953
Why,
how many of those at least tablets are 

2434
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:01,724
you taking on a daily basis?
I stopped taking them just right now 

2435
01:48:04,011 --> 01:48:05,600
while I'm breastfeeding,
breastfeeding.

2436
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:07,840
I'm just always on the cautious side.
Um,

2437
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:12,860
I was taking,
I think I was taking 250 milligrams.

2438
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:13,560
I think

2439
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:15,730
each pill is.
No,

2440
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:17,720
I don't.
I don't remember,

2441
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:19,690
you know,
uh,

2442
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:23,120
before I forgot,
I did want to ask you about it,

2443
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:27,110
but when we butt dialing,
but circling back to this whole carnival

2444
01:48:27,111 --> 01:48:27,944
thing,
one of the suggestions was that it 

2445
01:48:29,811 --> 01:48:33,170
isn't,
is it possible that people,

2446
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:37,970
that some small percentage of the 
population would actually be allergic to

2447
01:48:37,971 --> 01:48:38,840
a lot of plants?

2448
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:41,510
I mean,
there are people that can be allergic to

2449
01:48:41,511 --> 01:48:43,220
certain component.
I mean there's,

2450
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:46,880
there's the whole night shade family I 
think some people can,

2451
01:48:46,881 --> 01:48:51,620
like they have allergic reactions to and
I think that people with nightshades,

2452
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:53,180
tomatoes,
tomatoes,

2453
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:55,190
peppers,
egg plant.

2454
01:48:55,191 --> 01:48:56,024
Yeah.
Yeah.

2455
01:48:56,270 --> 01:48:59,810
Um,
and then I also people with gut issues.

2456
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:00,760
Have you ever heard of anyone

2457
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:01,590
being allergic?
Oh,

2458
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:04,160
so gut issues would predispose you to 
being

2459
01:49:04,230 --> 01:49:05,063
well because you know,
there are other things in the plants 

2460
01:49:06,691 --> 01:49:08,050
that can pop,
you know,

2461
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:11,070
so things people like to talk about,
like lectins for example,

2462
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:14,100
and you know,
lectins there they are,

2463
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:16,710
they are in a lot of plants but they're 
much more concentrated.

2464
01:49:16,711 --> 01:49:18,740
Something like a legume,
like a bean and,

2465
01:49:18,850 --> 01:49:19,683
and they're inactivated with heat.
But typically most people don't have 

2466
01:49:24,331 --> 01:49:25,610
reactions to,
to,

2467
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:30,030
to lectins and possibly if they already 
have some sort of gut barrier or problem

2468
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:33,150
that could sort of elicit a reaction.
But,

2469
01:49:33,151 --> 01:49:33,984
um,
a lot of the data out there as in vitro 

2470
01:49:36,531 --> 01:49:39,210
where lectins are used to stimulate the 
immune system in vitro.

2471
01:49:39,211 --> 01:49:40,044
In fact,
I've used lectins before to do an 

2472
01:49:41,401 --> 01:49:43,110
experiment,
but,

2473
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,191
you know,
um,

2474
01:49:44,191 --> 01:49:45,840
so I think that yeah,
there's,

2475
01:49:45,930 --> 01:49:50,930
there's certainly food allergies are,
are definitely a possibility and they do

2476
01:49:51,281 --> 01:49:51,850
exist.

2477
01:49:51,850 --> 01:49:52,683
So is it possible that someone would be 
allergic to both cruciferous vegetables 

2478
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,570
and,
you know,

2479
01:49:57,580 --> 01:50:01,990
a bunch of other like salary or 
cucumbers or things along those lines?

2480
01:50:02,670 --> 01:50:04,980
I don't know if they're allergic to 
them.

2481
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:08,010
Maybe.
I think that people can have,

2482
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:09,610
um,
you know,

2483
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:10,463
with like a variety of different issues 
like small intestinal bacterial 

2484
01:50:13,111 --> 01:50:15,550
overgrowth in their intestines.
Um,

2485
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:17,190
you know,
people that are,

2486
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:19,740
that are sensitive to fodmaps,
those things.

2487
01:50:19,741 --> 01:50:23,510
So it's a fodmap for,
I don't have toast oligosaccharide like,

2488
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:27,330
I can't remember what.
But the basically people,

2489
01:50:27,331 --> 01:50:30,090
people can be sensitive to them.
They're usually people with gut issues,

2490
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:33,580
like boils down to gut issues.
And Gut issues and I,

2491
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:34,463
and that there certainly is some 
cruciferous vegetables like cabbage or 

2492
01:50:38,941 --> 01:50:39,774
something can affect people.
They can feel bloated and stuff like 

2493
01:50:41,821 --> 01:50:42,300
that.
Yeah,

2494
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:43,133
absolutely.
But I do think that sometimes resolving 

2495
01:50:45,391 --> 01:50:48,480
those gut issues will resolve that 
problem.

2496
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:49,830
Um,
I don't,

2497
01:50:49,830 --> 01:50:50,663
I don't tend to think everyone's like 
someone's going to be allergic to every 

2498
01:50:53,041 --> 01:50:55,050
plant.
I don't know though.

2499
01:50:55,051 --> 01:50:55,884
I mean,
you know,

2500
01:50:55,950 --> 01:50:57,050
anything's possible,
right?

2501
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:58,950
There's no literature,
there's no,

2502
01:50:59,010 --> 01:50:59,843
there's no come across any,
but I haven't done an in depth search 

2503
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,270
for that specific thing.

2504
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:07,213
So is it fair to say that when people 
are describing this and they're saying 

2505
01:51:10,910 --> 01:51:15,080
that it might be possible that there are
a small percentage of the population,

2506
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,410
are there is a small percentage of the 
population that's allergic to plants,

2507
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:19,453
that really what you're dealing with as 
a small percentage of population that 

2508
01:51:22,221 --> 01:51:23,054
has a significantly impaired gut biome 
that is finding benefit to eliminating 

2509
01:51:28,011 --> 01:51:28,844
these plants,
this strict elimination diet being on 

2510
01:51:30,771 --> 01:51:34,820
this carnivore diet which also has 
calorie restrictive aspects to it,

2511
01:51:34,821 --> 01:51:35,654
and even fasting restricted restricted 
aspects to it that this is why they're 

2512
01:51:39,021 --> 01:51:39,854
experiencing this positive benefit.
And that perhaps one of the ways they 

2513
01:51:44,781 --> 01:51:45,614
could fix their gut biome would be some 
sort of prolonged fast or something 

2514
01:51:50,030 --> 01:51:50,863
along those lines to try to fix the 
problem at the root source instead of 

2515
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:59,030
maybe what the carnivore diet would be 
as like some sort of a,

2516
01:51:59,090 --> 01:52:00,740
um,
a dietary bandaid.

2517
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,970
Right.
And I think that the study I was talking

2518
01:52:02,971 --> 01:52:07,740
about the 15 day intermittent fast for 
were people with autoimmune disease.

2519
01:52:07,741 --> 01:52:09,540
We're fasted for 24 hours every other 
day.

2520
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:11,333
They had changes in their microbiome 
that we're in line of very interesting 

2521
01:52:15,391 --> 01:52:18,870
changes.
They actually grew bacteria that are,

2522
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:19,681
uh,
you know,

2523
01:52:19,681 --> 01:52:20,370
very,
uh,

2524
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:23,400
important for producing things like 
butyrate,

2525
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:25,410
which makes,
you know,

2526
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:26,363
helps make t regulatory cells at the 
signaling molecule that helps your 

2527
01:52:29,401 --> 01:52:33,330
immune system produce more t regulatory 
immune cells.

2528
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:35,970
It also something that comes from a 
state of Ketosis as well.

2529
01:52:36,110 --> 01:52:37,110
Um,
well this.

2530
01:52:37,111 --> 01:52:37,801
Yeah,
exactly.

2531
01:52:37,801 --> 01:52:38,611
They were fasting.
Yeah.

2532
01:52:38,611 --> 01:52:39,444
And the thing that was so interesting 
and it's a question I had had for so 

2533
01:52:41,611 --> 01:52:42,444
long,
it's like what happens the microbiome 

2534
01:52:44,461 --> 01:52:47,650
when you don't eat,
like is it to start,

2535
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:48,493
you know,
are you getting like a selection for 

2536
01:52:49,761 --> 01:52:50,594
mucin degrading bacteria which are 
degrading a certain glycoproteins that 

2537
01:52:53,031 --> 01:52:53,780
lines the gut.

2538
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:54,613
And you know,
and the thing that was so interesting 

2539
01:52:56,331 --> 01:53:00,470
about this study was that they did this 
like metogenomic analysis and they found

2540
01:53:00,650 --> 01:53:04,790
from fecal samples that P,
that the gene in the,

2541
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:05,653
within the existing microbiome,
it was increasing the production of 

2542
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,400
ketone bodies themselves.
And that was fueling because your,

2543
01:53:11,470 --> 01:53:13,190
your gut cells,
your gut cells,

2544
01:53:13,191 --> 01:53:14,780
and also a lot of the beneficial 
bacteria,

2545
01:53:15,050 --> 01:53:17,330
like things like butyrate,
lactate,

2546
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:19,230
appropriate Acetate,
no,

2547
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:20,930
these are some of the short chain fatty 
acids.

2548
01:53:20,931 --> 01:53:22,670
Buda rates like the big one of the gut 
for the gut,

2549
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:23,690
like gut cells,
like,

2550
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,600
like an 80 or 90 percent are like using 
butyrate.

2551
01:53:26,950 --> 01:53:29,540
But fasting was increasing all these 
ketone bodies.

2552
01:53:29,990 --> 01:53:32,450
So it's kind of really interesting 
because for one,

2553
01:53:32,451 --> 01:53:33,070
it,
it,

2554
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:34,760
it helped and it,
and it basically,

2555
01:53:34,761 --> 01:53:36,170
um,
uh,

2556
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:39,350
increased the diversity of this 
beneficial bacteria.

2557
01:53:39,351 --> 01:53:41,840
It was very interesting.
I wouldn't have guessed that.

2558
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:43,120
Have there been asking,

2559
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:44,033
have there been any studies on 
consumption of exoticness ketones to 

2560
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:49,080
benefit the gut biome?

2561
01:53:49,470 --> 01:53:51,040
Not that I'm aware of.
I mean,

2562
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:53,190
do you think that that would mirror it 
in any way?

2563
01:53:54,030 --> 01:53:54,863
That's a very interesting question 
because most of the exogenous would be 

2564
01:53:58,171 --> 01:54:01,950
like a Beta hydroxybutyrate ester.
I don't.

2565
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:02,933
The,
the question would be how similar is 

2566
01:54:05,521 --> 01:54:07,100
Beta hydroxy butyrate.
Butyrate,

2567
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:08,660
right?
Because Peter rates what,

2568
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:12,090
what we're talking about.
That's a very interesting question.

2569
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:13,980
I don't know.
Yeah,

2570
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:15,750
I mean that would be.
Or even what,

2571
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:17,850
what's happening during,
um,

2572
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:21,150
during like a ketogenic diet as well,
right.

2573
01:54:21,210 --> 01:54:22,043
You're making,
you have a lot of circulating Beta 

2574
01:54:23,011 --> 01:54:24,090
hydroxy butyrate,
is that,

2575
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:27,300
does that get to the gut and is there,
you know.

2576
01:54:27,330 --> 01:54:30,060
So that's,
that's another interesting question.

2577
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:32,060
Yeah.
Because it is an interesting way to hack

2578
01:54:32,061 --> 01:54:32,894
your system is that these exemptions,
ketones like a key gen x or that's one 

2579
01:54:36,231 --> 01:54:39,260
that I use for a few other companies 
that make these.

2580
01:54:39,261 --> 01:54:41,420
They do put your body in a state of 
Ketosis.

2581
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:42,171
Yeah.
No,

2582
01:54:42,171 --> 01:54:43,880
I've definitely tried.
I've tried one,

2583
01:54:44,270 --> 01:54:45,710
um,
from,

2584
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:50,510
from hpm n the Beta hydroxybutyrate 
Ester and um,

2585
01:54:51,110 --> 01:54:51,920
I,
I,

2586
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,900
it definitely like gives me energy.
Um,

2587
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:58,190
but the other thing I really liked was 
the mental effects,

2588
01:54:58,191 --> 01:55:00,170
the thing,
the thing about it.

2589
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:01,610
So a couple,
there's a sort of,

2590
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:06,640
it's sort of a double edge sword because
I feel less anxious when I take it.

2591
01:55:07,041 --> 01:55:08,840
And this was,
this is getting me up until like,

2592
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:12,170
you know,
four point five millimolar,

2593
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,780
Beta hydroxybutyrate in like an hour 
[inaudible] I,

2594
01:55:14,850 --> 01:55:17,930
um,
I feel less anxious and more full,

2595
01:55:17,970 --> 01:55:20,600
more in the present.
Like I'm more present and not like,

2596
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:22,880
you know,
a million things ahead.

2597
01:55:22,881 --> 01:55:25,060
Whereas like sometimes my brain goes 
right.

2598
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:26,190
So I felt like,
and,

2599
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:27,880
and,
and this is something that like,

2600
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:29,880
like Dan observed with me,
you know,

2601
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:33,770
because I felt this more than once I 
started using it.

2602
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:36,680
I started using,
I didn't use it today but the reason why

2603
01:55:36,681 --> 01:55:37,514
I didn't use it today,
so I started using it for podcast or 

2604
01:55:40,941 --> 01:55:41,774
being talks or anything like.
And the reason I didn't use it today is 

2605
01:55:45,781 --> 01:55:50,400
because the flip side is it dramatically
because I'm not in Ketosis,

2606
01:55:50,401 --> 01:55:54,300
I'm not on a ketogenic diet,
it lowers my blood sugar levels,

2607
01:55:54,330 --> 01:55:57,450
like really dramatically and this has 
been published,

2608
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:58,433
you know,
there's like mechanisms that are trying 

2609
01:55:59,581 --> 01:56:00,414
to be explored to understanding why that
is and possibly as a therapeutic 

2610
01:56:03,301 --> 01:56:05,250
treatment for type two diabetes and 
things like that.

2611
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,020
But so if,
once the,

2612
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:10,980
once the ketones were off,
which they do after a couple of hours,

2613
01:56:11,490 --> 01:56:12,323
I'd crash because my blood glucose is 
low and I don't have the ketones there 

2614
01:56:15,541 --> 01:56:16,560
to compensate.
Right.

2615
01:56:16,650 --> 01:56:19,200
Whereas if I was already in Ketosis 
then,

2616
01:56:19,730 --> 01:56:20,563
you know,
it wouldn't matter because I'd already 

2617
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:23,420
had been in Ketosis.
You know what I'm saying?

2618
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,151
I see.
Yeah.

2619
01:56:24,151 --> 01:56:25,080
So,
so,

2620
01:56:25,081 --> 01:56:26,310
um,
yeah,

2621
01:56:26,311 --> 01:56:28,350
it's really interesting.
The effects on the brain.

2622
01:56:28,351 --> 01:56:29,184
I don't,
you know,

2623
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:31,770
it's something that I noticed and I 
certainly,

2624
01:56:31,830 --> 01:56:35,140
I'm like repeatedly noticed,
you know,

2625
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:37,860
what would be the mechanism that would 
allow you to be more present?

2626
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:38,903
That's,
that seems so strange that that would 

2627
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:42,010
have less anxiety.
I mean,

2628
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:43,350
what would,
what would cause that?

2629
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:45,460
I don't know,
I mean there's,

2630
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:46,953
you know,
possibly the glucose is being spared in 

2631
01:56:48,791 --> 01:56:50,710
my brain for other things.
That's,

2632
01:56:50,830 --> 01:56:52,170
you know,
because now the Ketone,

2633
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:53,033
the Beta hydroxy is being used as a 
source of energy and glucose is being 

2634
01:56:55,841 --> 01:56:57,610
used.
I mean liquid sparing does occur,

2635
01:56:57,980 --> 01:56:58,813
um,
a lot of times in the context of making 

2636
01:57:00,851 --> 01:57:01,684
more glutathione because that's 
glucose's can be used for energy or it 

2637
01:57:05,351 --> 01:57:06,184
can be used to make glutathione and the 
pathway that does that is through a 

2638
01:57:09,371 --> 01:57:13,750
pathway called the pentose phosphate 
shunt and that pathway takes glucose and

2639
01:57:13,751 --> 01:57:16,330
make something called any dph,
which is then used,

2640
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:18,450
which isn't necessary to make 
glutathione.

2641
01:57:19,090 --> 01:57:21,010
So I don't know,
maybe there's some kind of,

2642
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:22,180
some.
Because you know,

2643
01:57:22,181 --> 01:57:23,014
what else does it for me so far?
Fain sulforaphane gives me major anti 

2644
01:57:27,751 --> 01:57:31,660
anxiety effects and like cognitive,
like I feel Broccoli sprouts,

2645
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:32,553
consumers,
which does affect Gludethyon in the 

2646
01:57:33,911 --> 01:57:34,780
brain.
Oh,

2647
01:57:34,781 --> 01:57:37,120
I never thought about them anyways.
It's all hypothetical.

2648
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:41,110
What about I'm consuming those exogenous
ketones with glutathione?

2649
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:43,900
Have you ever tried that?
I didn't know those existed.

2650
01:57:44,110 --> 01:57:45,130
I mean trying.
Oh,

2651
01:57:45,131 --> 01:57:47,170
you mean with the Broccoli sprouts,
Broccoli sprouts.

2652
01:57:47,171 --> 01:57:47,931
You mean?
Yeah,

2653
01:57:47,931 --> 01:57:50,830
well you're saying glutosiome increases 
glutathione in the brain,

2654
01:57:50,831 --> 01:57:52,580
but what about a glutosiome supplemental

2655
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:54,900
gludethyon supplements?
Glutathione,

2656
01:57:55,990 --> 01:57:57,670
first of all,
it gets destroyed in the gut,

2657
01:57:57,671 --> 01:57:59,570
but like even if your were to get it 
into your,

2658
01:57:59,910 --> 01:58:03,100
your bloodstream,
there's no transporter for glue to found

2659
01:58:03,101 --> 01:58:07,000
to get into cells.
So you want to make,

2660
01:58:07,030 --> 01:58:07,863
I mean,
you can get the precursors to make it 

2661
01:58:08,981 --> 01:58:10,960
and you can increase the way Broccoli 
sprouts does.

2662
01:58:10,961 --> 01:58:14,410
It is increases enzymes that make it so 
you're making more.

2663
01:58:14,411 --> 01:58:15,400
And so that's how you do it.

2664
01:58:15,610 --> 01:58:16,443
So when you see,
so one of the things that glutathione 

2665
01:58:19,991 --> 01:58:23,560
does is it helps your body processes 
alcohol,

2666
01:58:23,561 --> 01:58:24,394
correct?

2667
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:26,920
Um,
I don't,

2668
01:58:26,921 --> 01:58:28,380
I mean,
it's a power plant.

2669
01:58:28,381 --> 01:58:29,050
Oxidant

2670
01:58:29,050 --> 01:58:30,930
wasn't that what Mark Gordon talked 
about?

2671
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:32,671
Lipos.
Somo.

2672
01:58:32,671 --> 01:58:35,730
Gludethyon,
yes.

2673
01:58:36,690 --> 01:58:37,523
Yeah.
Lyposomal glutathione thigh on helps 

2674
01:58:39,181 --> 01:58:41,350
your body with the,

2675
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:45,410
the processing of alcohol.
It's a very,

2676
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:49,310
very strong um,
and toxin antioxidant.

2677
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:50,360
And so,
I mean,

2678
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:53,330
but it gets destroyed in your gut.
So if you're taking it.

2679
01:58:53,331 --> 01:58:54,164
Yeah.
Yeah.

2680
01:58:54,410 --> 01:58:57,740
And also go to thumb doesn't,
it doesn't get into yourself.

2681
01:58:58,820 --> 01:59:01,580
There's a video about it from,
from this podcast.

2682
01:59:01,670 --> 01:59:02,930
Oh No,
there you go.

2683
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:04,303
Um,

2684
01:59:05,310 --> 01:59:06,143
yeah,
that was something about the processing 

2685
01:59:08,311 --> 01:59:11,170
of alcohol now.
So if,

2686
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:12,353
how would it.
So the best way to get it would be 

2687
01:59:13,591 --> 01:59:16,710
through sulforaphane from Broccoli 
sprouts,

2688
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:19,890
cruciferous vegetables,
and then your body would produce more.

2689
01:59:19,950 --> 01:59:20,650
Well.
So from the,

2690
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:23,250
the,
the human studies that I've referenced,

2691
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:26,730
one was 300 grams of Brussels sprouts a 
day,

2692
01:59:26,731 --> 01:59:29,400
increased it,
go to gludethyon on plasma by Fort One,

2693
01:59:29,401 --> 01:59:31,770
point four fold.
The other study.

2694
01:59:31,771 --> 01:59:32,604
I'm more recently that showed an 
increase in plasma as well as in the 

2695
01:59:35,641 --> 01:59:38,460
brain.
That was a sulfur,

2696
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:41,340
that was a broccoli sprout extract that 
was given.

2697
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:44,400
I don't have the dose on My instagram,
I think,

2698
01:59:44,401 --> 01:59:45,750
I don't remember.
I'm talking about the dose,

2699
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:49,110
but um,
so that's one of the ways I know of,

2700
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:50,073
uh,
one of the most powerful ways I know of 

2701
01:59:51,151 --> 01:59:55,410
to increase glutathione and you know,
basically in humans.

2702
01:59:55,890 --> 01:59:58,980
So I don't know how much 300 grams of 
Brussel sprouts is.

2703
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,800
So what would be a good idea?
I mean,

2704
02:00:01,950 --> 02:00:05,660
pressure from wrong would be a large 
dose of Electra,

2705
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:06,533
large plate of Brussels sprouts with a 
or Broccoli sprouts with some sort of a 

2706
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:14,940
ketone supplement

2707
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:16,133
or if you're doing a pure in Ketosis,
whether that's fasting time restricted 

2708
02:00:19,091 --> 02:00:20,860
eating.
So that's something that I do.

2709
02:00:20,861 --> 02:00:24,580
So I am definitely trying to get my 
ketosis in or you're on a ketogenic diet

2710
02:00:24,581 --> 02:00:26,680
and you're getting.
So the question is,

2711
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:28,413
um,
I'm not sure the glucose sparing stuff 

2712
02:00:31,511 --> 02:00:32,344
that's been shown in animal,
so I don't know how much of that is 

2713
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:37,420
translatable to humans.
What effect,

2714
02:00:37,421 --> 02:00:38,254
I mean,
you always have to have evidence to say 

2715
02:00:39,401 --> 02:00:41,840
something definitively,
but um,

2716
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:43,083
animal studies do show that there is a 
glucose sparing effect when you have 

2717
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:48,710
ketone bodies.
Um,

2718
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:50,590
so,
you know,

2719
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:52,420
just fascinating.
It was fascinating.

2720
02:00:52,421 --> 02:00:55,360
That will make you more present.
You know,

2721
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:56,583
they're,
what's fascinating is that sulforaphane 

2722
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:00,310
treats autistic symptoms,
right?

2723
02:01:00,370 --> 02:01:01,061
I mean,
right.

2724
02:01:01,061 --> 02:01:02,140
So,
yeah.

2725
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:02,891
Right,
right.

2726
02:01:02,891 --> 02:01:03,724
So what's going on there is definitely.
And there's also been an open label 

2727
02:01:06,221 --> 02:01:09,490
study,
so there has been two trials with two or

2728
02:01:09,491 --> 02:01:10,324
maybe three and Dr Jed Fahy,
he's been a part of this as well as his 

2729
02:01:12,791 --> 02:01:15,880
colleagues,
a randomized placebo controlled and open

2730
02:01:15,881 --> 02:01:16,714
label,
which is always less open label means 

2731
02:01:18,671 --> 02:01:19,504
there wasn't a placebo control,
but they didn't measure metabolites of 

2732
02:01:23,300 --> 02:01:26,080
sulfur,
sulfur of pain and also oxidative stress

2733
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:27,490
in,
in plasma,

2734
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:28,353
which always helps.

2735
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:29,533
Um,
and then there's been a trial and 

2736
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:32,590
schizophrenia patients,
so for a grant helps with that as well.

2737
02:01:32,591 --> 02:01:33,424
That was open label.
Right now there's an ongoing placebo 

2738
02:01:35,111 --> 02:01:37,660
controlled trial that's now taking 
place.

2739
02:01:38,170 --> 02:01:40,100
So there's very interesting

2740
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,710
effects on the brain,
you know,

2741
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:46,490
it seems as though there is some 
oxidative stress component,

2742
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:47,890
you know,
I have a,

2743
02:01:47,890 --> 02:01:50,510
we for who knows how much,
you know,

2744
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:55,560
their oxidative stress may be happening 
more in my brain because of we for um,

2745
02:01:55,970 --> 02:01:58,910
there's certainly increased risk for 
Alzheimer's disease,

2746
02:01:58,911 --> 02:01:59,880
increase,
you know,

2747
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:01,850
the traumatic brain injury,
poor outcome,

2748
02:02:01,851 --> 02:02:02,684
all,
there's all this evidence that sort of 

2749
02:02:03,111 --> 02:02:06,370
shows that don't start boxing.
Definitely not kickboxing.

2750
02:02:07,310 --> 02:02:08,143
So do you think that mean it seems like 
a perfect pre podcast meal would be 

2751
02:02:13,101 --> 02:02:15,210
these Broccoli sprouts?
Yeah,

2752
02:02:15,790 --> 02:02:18,320
maybe an exhaustion as ketone drink as 
well,

2753
02:02:18,380 --> 02:02:20,280
like the two of them together.
Yes.

2754
02:02:20,281 --> 02:02:21,114
So,
so the only thing is like I mentioned 

2755
02:02:21,981 --> 02:02:22,814
for me,
I crash after a couple of hours where 

2756
02:02:24,921 --> 02:02:27,890
I'm like,
like it's like really like,

2757
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:28,753
like crashing.
I think you could mitigate that with 

2758
02:02:30,471 --> 02:02:34,250
maybe some sort of a glucose because one
of the things maybe so yeah,

2759
02:02:34,251 --> 02:02:35,084
they say to take when you're taking 
those ketone salts or ketone esters are 

2760
02:02:38,931 --> 02:02:39,764
really potent ones,
is to take them with glucose and they 

2761
02:02:42,501 --> 02:02:43,334
actually say on,
they say in the instructions to take it 

2762
02:02:45,141 --> 02:02:46,340
with a high carbohydrate meal.

2763
02:02:46,930 --> 02:02:47,763
And so I usually will take,
I'll usually eat a bowl of oatmeal with 

2764
02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:53,120
some fruit and um,
and I'll take it.

2765
02:02:53,121 --> 02:02:53,954
But,
but still it really like it lowers my 

2766
02:02:56,301 --> 02:02:57,134
blood,
my blood glucose levels dramatically 

2767
02:02:58,491 --> 02:03:00,520
within an hour.
It's like that's interesting.

2768
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:05,060
I'm serious when I've taken those 
supplements,

2769
02:03:05,061 --> 02:03:06,770
I don't,
I don't feel the crash.

2770
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:09,650
Try Try that when I'm talking to him.
Man,

2771
02:03:09,830 --> 02:03:14,570
it's a really powerful HP.
HIV and HIV and M,

2772
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:16,733
I should've brought you some.
I have some in the hotel thinking about 

2773
02:03:20,061 --> 02:03:21,290
trying and taking it,
but I was like,

2774
02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:22,640
I don't.
Does it taste like ass?

2775
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,110
Yeah,
it tastes really bad.

2776
02:03:24,111 --> 02:03:26,270
I mean like definitely say,
you know,

2777
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:28,850
so bad.
Some of them are so disgusting.

2778
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:33,380
I did an interview with the president of
the Buck Institute for Research on aging

2779
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:34,573
and I,
I like downed it right before he walked 

2780
02:03:36,861 --> 02:03:38,270
in and I was like.

2781
02:03:38,330 --> 02:03:39,163
And he had just published a study on,
on ketosis and animals and helping with 

2782
02:03:43,551 --> 02:03:46,430
lifespan and brain aging and stuff.
But.

2783
02:03:46,431 --> 02:03:47,690
So I had to tell him,
I'm like,

2784
02:03:48,290 --> 02:03:50,930
like here,
I just took this and I actually gave him

2785
02:03:50,931 --> 02:03:52,490
some as well.
But um,

2786
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:55,360
because it was kind of embarrassing.
Oh yeah.

2787
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:56,213
I was grimacing big time.
It was like a funny way to first meet 

2788
02:03:59,841 --> 02:04:00,674
someone.
I know I had just eaten some pineapple 

2789
02:04:02,211 --> 02:04:03,044
because they had like some fruit 
available and they didn't have any 

2790
02:04:04,341 --> 02:04:05,870
carbohydrate.
What am I going to.

2791
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:08,450
So anyways,
now you know all my secrets.

2792
02:04:09,070 --> 02:04:11,180
Well that's a good one.
That's fascinating.

2793
02:04:11,181 --> 02:04:12,014
I've never thought about that.
But that seems like a pre podcast meal 

2794
02:04:14,151 --> 02:04:17,210
or pre comedy show meal.
That might be like a really good idea to

2795
02:04:17,211 --> 02:04:20,180
try just a big plate of Broccoli 
sprouts,

2796
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:24,200
Broccoli sprouts with a really good 
source on the supplements are not.

2797
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:26,330
So it's really sulforaphane.
It's not very stable.

2798
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:29,900
So you can check it into a shake.
Do you grind it up?

2799
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:32,120
So I haven't been doing that.
Yes,

2800
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:33,253
I grind it up.
But you can just put them on a salad or 

2801
02:04:34,941 --> 02:04:35,774
you can just,
you know,

2802
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,950
you don't have to do it.
It doesn't taste good.

2803
02:04:38,050 --> 02:04:40,200
Right.
So like that's why you made a mistake.

2804
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:41,260
Um,
so,

2805
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:43,830
so if you're going to put an n shake 
with other other things,

2806
02:04:43,831 --> 02:04:44,664
you want to blend it up first because 
I'm the enzyme myrosinase that has to 

2807
02:04:48,811 --> 02:04:50,830
come in contact with the precursor of 
sulforaphane.

2808
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:53,160
Glucoraphanin has to be in contact with 
it.

2809
02:04:53,161 --> 02:04:55,500
So it's diluted out if you have like a 
big all this other stuff.

2810
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:58,800
So blended up first and then add your 
other stuff.

2811
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:00,803
But um,
I've been taking a supplement I got 

2812
02:05:02,731 --> 02:05:04,430
from,
from France called prostitution,

2813
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:05,393
which is,
there's published studies on it and it 

2814
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:08,010
tastes like Broccoli sprouts.

2815
02:05:08,430 --> 02:05:10,350
Um,
and uh,

2816
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:11,273
I've been taking that right now just 
because of the potential risk for 

2817
02:05:14,551 --> 02:05:17,730
contamination.
I'm just breastfeeding and you know,

2818
02:05:17,731 --> 02:05:19,990
I'm just like,
I'm always going to.

2819
02:05:20,990 --> 02:05:21,823
So I'm just Kinda [inaudible] that 
bacteria has been shown to be 

2820
02:05:23,311 --> 02:05:25,870
transferred from breast milk and juice.
There was like that,

2821
02:05:25,950 --> 02:05:26,783
that news story where the woman ate the 
placenta and like it was like I was 

2822
02:05:30,391 --> 02:05:31,224
reading this instagram who's a Vegan and
he was going on and on about people 

2823
02:05:34,651 --> 02:05:36,210
getting ECO law for meat.
I'm like,

2824
02:05:36,211 --> 02:05:37,260
Jesus Christ,
man,

2825
02:05:37,410 --> 02:05:40,410
you get it from fucking spinach,
Broccoli.

2826
02:05:40,411 --> 02:05:43,230
You get it from farm raised vegetables 
like stop.

2827
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:44,500
Right.
But,

2828
02:05:44,530 --> 02:05:45,363
but it comes,
he's writing in a way because it comes 

2829
02:05:47,491 --> 02:05:50,670
from the runoff from a animal feces.
Right.

2830
02:05:50,671 --> 02:05:52,950
And that's how it gets into.
Isn't that the case?

2831
02:05:52,951 --> 02:05:54,210
I don't know.
I'm pretty sure.

2832
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:57,470
I'm pretty sure that's how it gets into 
the food out,

2833
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:58,313
if that's true.

2834
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:03,720
I'm eco lie in vegetables comes from 
animal agriculture.

2835
02:06:06,390 --> 02:06:08,460
Google that,
I think that's true.

2836
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:15,120
I've certainly had some,
a bad sprouts before store bought.

2837
02:06:15,780 --> 02:06:17,210
I was sailing.
You got sick,

2838
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:18,480
I got sick,
you know,

2839
02:06:18,910 --> 02:06:21,170
and also I'm from,
once we made it home,

2840
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:22,460
you know,
it just,

2841
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:25,210
if you have to be really careful if you 
have too much water around,

2842
02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:26,053
if it's too much heat and condensation 
and all that stuff to it grows because 

2843
02:06:29,251 --> 02:06:30,660
you're eating it raw.
Yeah,

2844
02:06:30,661 --> 02:06:31,950
exactly.
So when you clean it,

2845
02:06:31,951 --> 02:06:36,780
I mean how difficult is it to clean?
Did you find anything from manure?

2846
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:37,730
Yeah.
Cool.

2847
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,590
Yeah.
So it is right?

2848
02:06:39,700 --> 02:06:41,640
Romance and general catalyst in 
particular.

2849
02:06:41,641 --> 02:06:43,070
Both beef and dairy.
Yep.

2850
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:45,810
Right.
So a lot of these,

2851
02:06:45,811 --> 02:06:48,540
especially like a real organic farm,
a lot of times they're,

2852
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:52,230
they're very,
they have animals,

2853
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:53,213
plants,
all sorts of other stuff together and 

2854
02:06:54,901 --> 02:06:56,700
the runoff from the cows.

2855
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,950
Good side of your Broccoli and all that 
jazz.

2856
02:06:59,260 --> 02:07:00,480
Yeah,
it's nasty.

2857
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:01,613
And how do you clean that?
I mean if I told you that Ecolab was on 

2858
02:07:05,671 --> 02:07:07,860
your vegetables,
you still want to eat them.

2859
02:07:07,861 --> 02:07:10,350
If you clean them,
you'd be eating that shit.

2860
02:07:10,530 --> 02:07:13,680
So how do you clean your vegetables?
I rinsed them.

2861
02:07:13,681 --> 02:07:14,940
Yeah,
but I mean,

2862
02:07:15,290 --> 02:07:17,910
right.
But how good usually don't get,

2863
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:20,460
I don't know if you knew,
like that's the thing,

2864
02:07:20,461 --> 02:07:22,170
like when people say,
Oh,

2865
02:07:22,171 --> 02:07:23,610
you should clean your vegetables,
I will.

2866
02:07:23,611 --> 02:07:24,444
Okay.
But if there was eco lie on those 

2867
02:07:25,681 --> 02:07:28,050
vegetables and you cleaned them,
we just think there'll be enough.

2868
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:32,450
Probably wouldn't wash your Greens won't
protect against Ecolab consumed.

2869
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:34,110
There you go.
The heat kills.

2870
02:07:34,111 --> 02:07:36,730
E coli and other types of bacteria can 
make you sick.

2871
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:39,310
Even Greens that are typically consume 
raw such as Romaine.

2872
02:07:39,311 --> 02:07:41,010
Lettuce can be cooked.
Okay,

2873
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:43,810
so equalized.
Destroyed at one 60 degrees Fahrenheit,

2874
02:07:43,811 --> 02:07:46,030
which is seems like everything.
Trick analysis.

2875
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:48,280
A lot of things killed at one.
One 60.

2876
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:52,600
So I'm so,
but the Broccoli sprouts,

2877
02:07:52,601 --> 02:07:54,670
you don't,
you don't consume cooked?

2878
02:07:55,190 --> 02:07:56,023
No.
Because the enzyme that converts the 

2879
02:07:58,651 --> 02:08:02,030
precursor into active Sulforaphane is 
heat sensitive.

2880
02:08:02,430 --> 02:08:03,450
Is it?
Um,

2881
02:08:03,610 --> 02:08:04,443
it,
does it diminish it significantly or 

2882
02:08:05,851 --> 02:08:06,750
kill it altogether?

2883
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:08,070
Significantly.
I mean,

2884
02:08:08,071 --> 02:08:08,904
you still,
there's still some plus the precursor 

2885
02:08:10,891 --> 02:08:12,130
that your,
um,

2886
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:14,710
that you know,
is important for forming silver fain.

2887
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:17,730
You actually have bacteria in your gut.
And this is,

2888
02:08:17,731 --> 02:08:18,564
um,
something that Dr Jed Fay he talked 

2889
02:08:19,471 --> 02:08:20,304
about,
um,

2890
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:21,930
when I,
when I interviewed him,

2891
02:08:22,190 --> 02:08:23,023
he was talking about there's certain 
strains of bacteria in the gut that 

2892
02:08:25,231 --> 02:08:26,064
convert because they have the enzyme 
myrosinase and they convert it into 

2893
02:08:28,550 --> 02:08:32,250
silver or feeding the gut so you can 
actually get a certain amount.

2894
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:34,270
He also mentioned that you can take,
um,

2895
02:08:34,830 --> 02:08:39,270
mustard seed powder and sprinkle it on 
top of your cooked Brussels sprouts,

2896
02:08:39,300 --> 02:08:40,920
your sauteed Kale,
which is,

2897
02:08:40,980 --> 02:08:43,140
this is what I do because I eat sauteed 
Kale.

2898
02:08:43,141 --> 02:08:45,030
And so I also have raw.
You eat raw kale,

2899
02:08:46,410 --> 02:08:49,710
mustard powder has the active enzyme so 
you can consume that.

2900
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:51,790
I'm with it.
Um,

2901
02:08:52,230 --> 02:08:54,040
that's the other thing,
like I mentioned the,

2902
02:08:54,180 --> 02:08:56,070
the,
there are the supplements I'm taking.

2903
02:08:56,071 --> 02:08:56,904
There is one out there also that is,
has a lot of the precursor and some of 

2904
02:09:00,301 --> 02:09:02,790
the enzyme.
And so you can get a modest amount of.

2905
02:09:02,791 --> 02:09:05,580
And this is what was used in the most 
recent autism study.

2906
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,170
Um,
it's called Avma call,

2907
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:08,420
but the one right spoken

2908
02:09:08,420 --> 02:09:11,520
like aV ,
a n wait,

2909
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:15,450
avi.
Avi m a v a m.

2910
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:20,600
Yes.
Av know ab and c o l e V m a c o l e V,

2911
02:09:26,430 --> 02:09:28,710
that one's,
that one's probably one of the best ones

2912
02:09:28,711 --> 02:09:30,000
in the US,
but prostate,

2913
02:09:31,230 --> 02:09:35,460
prostate feigns naturally produce fewer 
frame.

2914
02:09:36,710 --> 02:09:38,580
Dr Jed fetty has,
has test this,

2915
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:39,483
these teas test these different soul 
supplements and looked at Sulforaphane 

2916
02:09:43,051 --> 02:09:45,980
metabolites in urine to look at like 
bioavailability.

2917
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,740
And what is the one that you like?
You're prostituting.

2918
02:09:48,750 --> 02:09:51,150
I like apropos.
I've taken both,

2919
02:09:51,570 --> 02:09:54,660
but it's hard to get in the US.
Why is it hard?

2920
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,790
Because it's made.
It's in France.

2921
02:09:56,791 --> 02:09:58,610
It's a France.
Can we get this on Amazon?

2922
02:09:59,430 --> 02:10:00,330
Know what?

2923
02:10:02,970 --> 02:10:06,690
Amazon's got me hooked.
Now that you can get it,

2924
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:10,560
it's just find it somewhere.
A legal website maybe.

2925
02:10:10,790 --> 02:10:11,623
Okay.
So that's what I've been taking 

2926
02:10:15,001 --> 02:10:16,440
recently.
How much did you take?

2927
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:20,400
Um,
I'm taking three pills a day.

2928
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:23,340
I think each pill has 10 milligrams with
food.

2929
02:10:23,730 --> 02:10:25,590
Yes,
definitely.

2930
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:30,600
With food for absorption or um,
yeah,

2931
02:10:30,751 --> 02:10:34,910
it seems like it can be a little like,
you know,

2932
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:37,880
it seems it just sometimes if you're on 
an empty stomach,

2933
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:39,690
doesn't feel good.
Yeah.

2934
02:10:41,150 --> 02:10:43,450
I've had a lot of people email me,
you know,

2935
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:45,350
since the first time you and I talked 
about,

2936
02:10:45,351 --> 02:10:47,610
so for vein,
some of them have taken album call,

2937
02:10:47,611 --> 02:10:50,030
some have gotten a hold of phosphate and
some Broccoli sprouts.

2938
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:52,450
I mean,
I've had people talking about like tumor

2939
02:10:52,451 --> 02:10:54,320
shrinking and stuff,
like one guy.

2940
02:10:54,321 --> 02:10:56,630
Yeah,
I mean it's all anecdotal,

2941
02:10:57,050 --> 02:10:58,200
but um,
I've,

2942
02:10:58,260 --> 02:10:59,093
I've had multiple,
multiple people talking about their 

2943
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:03,530
prostates stimulating antigen going 
down.

2944
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:04,520
Sorry,
prostate.

2945
02:11:05,140 --> 02:11:07,970
Um,
is it stimulating PSA?

2946
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:10,910
[inaudible] my brain sort of dwindling 
out,

2947
02:11:10,911 --> 02:11:14,930
but I'm not going down.
I know it's a real thing.

2948
02:11:14,990 --> 02:11:16,400
It really is.
It's a real thing.

2949
02:11:16,401 --> 02:11:17,234
I mean I kind of,
I feel like I've done really good just 

2950
02:11:20,121 --> 02:11:23,060
from like exercise and getting all the 
fish oil and stuff,

2951
02:11:23,061 --> 02:11:26,240
but it's definitely,
there's constantly,

2952
02:11:26,241 --> 02:11:27,790
it's just all you're giving them 
everything.

2953
02:11:29,110 --> 02:11:31,540
Totally.
It,

2954
02:11:31,630 --> 02:11:36,630
it's the people that we were talking 
about this before the podcast with Dan,

2955
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:42,230
people that don't think that it's 
difficult to be a,

2956
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,870
just a mom or a stay at home mom.
You're crazy.

2957
02:11:45,290 --> 02:11:47,630
I was so judgmental and I really feel 
bad.

2958
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:51,080
I really do because it's the hardest 
thing.

2959
02:11:51,220 --> 02:11:52,250
Like,
like that.

2960
02:11:52,251 --> 02:11:54,100
I've,
I've ever done a great job.

2961
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:55,290
You want to do a good.
Oh really?

2962
02:11:55,420 --> 02:11:56,241
Oh,
it's the hardest thing.

2963
02:11:56,241 --> 02:11:56,841
He goes,
Hey,

2964
02:11:56,841 --> 02:11:58,310
job.
You could do with your pajamas on.

2965
02:11:58,311 --> 02:11:59,150
It's not the hardest thing.

2966
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:04,280
I really liked these.
Hilarious.

2967
02:12:04,281 --> 02:12:05,180
Yeah,
he's hilarious.

2968
02:12:05,210 --> 02:12:06,043
He's a great guy.
I mean if you want to do a good job and 

2969
02:12:07,341 --> 02:12:10,630
you're thinking about like the enriched 
environment and how important it is.

2970
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:11,513
I gotta do I gotta read to them.
I got to know all this and then all the 

2971
02:12:14,541 --> 02:12:16,420
nutrition and knocking the plastic and 
the.

2972
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:18,770
I mean it's just a lot of work.
Like,

2973
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,840
I don't know,
screamed you don't want to have like you

2974
02:12:20,841 --> 02:12:21,674
didn't want to sit them in front of the 
television and having them watching 

2975
02:12:23,061 --> 02:12:24,710
cartoons,
you know,

2976
02:12:24,711 --> 02:12:27,150
so which definitely would be easy.
Right.

2977
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:29,053
So,
and maybe the more kids you have your 

2978
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:33,140
kind of like something that I can't but,
but uh,

2979
02:12:33,141 --> 02:12:36,200
it's definitely a very,
very hard.

2980
02:12:36,230 --> 02:12:39,170
It's a hard job but very rewarding.
So rewarding.

2981
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:41,780
Like I just can't even believe I ever 
had a life before.

2982
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:43,480
My son,
you know,

2983
02:12:43,930 --> 02:12:45,020
I'm just,
my life is like,

2984
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:47,810
I get so much joy from him now and I'm 
just like,

2985
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:49,700
how do I get all this toy before?
It's like,

2986
02:12:49,810 --> 02:12:50,530
well,
it's Christmas.

2987
02:12:50,530 --> 02:12:53,070
I remember before you had them,
you were like,

2988
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:54,470
concerned like,
boy,

2989
02:12:54,471 --> 02:12:55,304
I wonder where my time's going to go 
from still going to be able to do 

2990
02:12:57,441 --> 02:12:58,640
research.
It's like,

2991
02:12:59,200 --> 02:13:01,030
whooo.
Yeah,

2992
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:01,873
it's hard.
And I thankfully I have my mother who 

2993
02:13:03,531 --> 02:13:06,290
helps out a lot and that gives me some 
time,

2994
02:13:06,650 --> 02:13:08,960
but I'm like essentially doing both.
You know?

2995
02:13:09,230 --> 02:13:11,480
Do you feel the switches going off in 
your brain,

2996
02:13:11,610 --> 02:13:14,780
your brain switches over because you're 
essentially.

2997
02:13:14,781 --> 02:13:17,220
There's some,
a biological mechanism that's happening.

2998
02:13:17,230 --> 02:13:18,063
It must be fascinating to study on 
yourself as you're watching it happen 

2999
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:22,161
because you're,
you know,

3000
02:13:22,161 --> 02:13:24,500
the oxytocin gets jacked through the 
roof.

3001
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:29,030
You have this little thing that you love
literally more than anything you've ever

3002
02:13:29,031 --> 02:13:31,980
experienced in your entire existence.
You can't believe how much you

3003
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,070
love them.
It's hard to imagine like I,

3004
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:36,053
it's hard for me as a father to imagine 
what it would be like to be a mother 

3005
02:13:40,170 --> 02:13:43,510
because I think there's a big difference
because I think there's,

3006
02:13:43,511 --> 02:13:46,080
and this is one of the reasons why me 
and my wife had a deal.

3007
02:13:46,081 --> 02:13:48,930
I didn't name any of the kids.
I just had veto power.

3008
02:13:49,470 --> 02:13:52,860
It's like you can't call the kid like 
fucking turnip or some stupid shit.

3009
02:13:53,190 --> 02:13:55,310
You know what I mean?
Like I mean,

3010
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:58,740
it's just nothing.
Nobody but you.

3011
02:13:58,860 --> 02:14:01,020
It's in your body.
I mean you're cooking.

3012
02:14:01,021 --> 02:14:03,480
It impacts you that I know inside of 
you.

3013
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:08,510
The difference in the job a man does and
a woman does in terms of like the actual

3014
02:14:10,530 --> 02:14:14,580
making of the baby could not be further 
apart from each other.

3015
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:18,270
The guy just does something that feels 
great and it's done,

3016
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:23,550
and then the woman goes through this 
insane hormonal process.

3017
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:26,580
Her body morphs.
She gains 50,

3018
02:14:26,581 --> 02:14:30,030
60 plus pounds.
Her body stretches out.

3019
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:32,220
She's got a baby inside of her.
It's kicking her.

3020
02:14:32,221 --> 02:14:34,110
She's uncomfortable.
She can't move.

3021
02:14:34,111 --> 02:14:34,944
She's swelling.
Then she has to go through excruciating 

3022
02:14:37,051 --> 02:14:39,990
pain.
There was a video on dig from yesterday,

3023
02:14:40,620 --> 02:14:43,740
see if you can find it where they have a
labor.

3024
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:44,633
I'm recreating like pain device that 
they put men under and they have these 

3025
02:14:51,301 --> 02:14:56,301
fucking macho men that they have this 
machine that they do something,

3026
02:14:56,761 --> 02:14:59,970
they have these a sense these,
we'll put it up,

3027
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,830
we'll figure it out.
How the fuck they did it,

3028
02:15:02,070 --> 02:15:02,903
but it somehow or another reenacts the 
pain of labor and let's a man 

3029
02:15:07,681 --> 02:15:09,470
experienced what it's like get your 
vagina

3030
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:11,240
blown apart.
That's crazy.

3031
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:12,143
You know,
it is.

3032
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:15,770
You just totally explained.
I mean the whole pregnancy and then like

3033
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:16,753
the delivery and moves just like.
And then it's like a part of you is 

3034
02:15:21,591 --> 02:15:23,840
walking around.
Whereas for the man,

3035
02:15:23,841 --> 02:15:24,674
it's like a,
yeah,

3036
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:26,480
that's my kid.
Wow.

3037
02:15:26,481 --> 02:15:27,314
And you get all this oxytocin rush,
but I don't even think it's a fraction 

3038
02:15:29,450 --> 02:15:30,800
of breastfeeding,
you know,

3039
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:33,200
that whole like nursing,
that's like huge.

3040
02:15:33,201 --> 02:15:34,034
Oxytocin lays huge here and then of 
course there's the no sleep for like 

3041
02:15:38,650 --> 02:15:39,441
months.
And for me,

3042
02:15:39,441 --> 02:15:40,670
like I,
um,

3043
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:44,180
my son,
like he's seen a bottle like,

3044
02:15:44,270 --> 02:15:46,310
I don't know,
six or seven times.

3045
02:15:46,311 --> 02:15:50,900
Like I just always been the pool pump.
Um,

3046
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:52,490
so because I was always there,
I,

3047
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:55,670
I've only had a pump a few times.
The thing about pumping that seems to be

3048
02:15:55,671 --> 02:15:58,430
really good though is that the kids can 
get more of it.

3049
02:15:59,030 --> 02:16:00,700
It's like,
depending on how,

3050
02:16:00,710 --> 02:16:01,543
wherever it had an issue was actually an
over producer and I had an issue of too 

3051
02:16:05,511 --> 02:16:06,500
much where,
yeah,

3052
02:16:06,501 --> 02:16:07,340
it's like,
he's like,

3053
02:16:07,450 --> 02:16:08,540
oh mom.
Yeah.

3054
02:16:08,541 --> 02:16:13,250
So I was looking for that and I stumbled
across this syndrome.

3055
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:14,993
Sympathetic pregnancy is a proposed 
condition which a partner experience 

3056
02:16:17,071 --> 02:16:20,000
with some symptoms and that's just a 
bitch ass man.

3057
02:16:21,050 --> 02:16:24,830
These include minor weight gain,
altered hormone levels,

3058
02:16:24,860 --> 02:16:27,080
morning nausea and disturbed sleep 
patterns.

3059
02:16:27,081 --> 02:16:29,040
Like I said,
that's just a bitch ass man.

3060
02:16:29,090 --> 02:16:30,190
Disturb sleep patterns

3061
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:34,450
come after the baby's born.
Let me tell you that silly mag,

3062
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:35,560
but I,
I know what you're talking about.

3063
02:16:35,561 --> 02:16:37,040
Yeah.
Some guys say that over again.

3064
02:16:37,210 --> 02:16:38,021
Again,
we're too,

3065
02:16:38,021 --> 02:16:39,970
and I was pregnant.
That's because you're a lazy.

3066
02:16:40,630 --> 02:16:42,370
That excuse you lazy and he ate more 
food.

3067
02:16:42,371 --> 02:16:45,040
You fucking Slob.
That has nothing to do with a baby being

3068
02:16:45,041 --> 02:16:46,900
in your body.
Shut your mouth.

3069
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:48,700
That's.
That's embarrassing.

3070
02:16:49,290 --> 02:16:52,420
I'm pregnant to now you're not.
I hate women.

3071
02:16:52,490 --> 02:16:53,500
Say we're pregnant.
Yeah,

3072
02:16:53,501 --> 02:16:54,460
we're pregnant.
No,

3073
02:16:54,461 --> 02:16:55,720
we're not.
No,

3074
02:16:55,721 --> 02:16:57,760
we're not pregnant.
Mike.

3075
02:16:58,480 --> 02:16:59,890
You're not pregnant.
Mc.

3076
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:02,590
She's pregnant.
You got her pregnant.

3077
02:17:02,591 --> 02:17:04,240
You fuck.
What does it say here?

3078
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:05,740
Labor pain.
Simulated here.

3079
02:17:05,741 --> 02:17:07,510
Here it is.
Look at these guys.

3080
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:09,753
Do some volume.

3081
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:20,093
Talk to me right now.
Who Do you almost getting to like the 

3082
02:17:22,021 --> 02:17:22,520
activity

3083
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:24,490
stage of labor where it's really getting
good.

3084
02:17:24,510 --> 02:17:27,770
This is the beginning ramps up.

3085
02:17:31,940 --> 02:17:34,830
Starting to come down on.
You guys are doing.

3086
02:17:40,820 --> 02:17:41,720
I mean it really does.

3087
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:45,120
What's next is these gals put a strap on
on.

3088
02:17:45,130 --> 02:17:45,963
They pegged these dudes next.
Just have sensors on their stomach it 

3089
02:17:49,061 --> 02:17:49,894
looks like.
Right?

3090
02:17:50,120 --> 02:17:51,540
It's like a,
you know,

3091
02:17:51,550 --> 02:17:52,383
one of them like,
you know there's electromuscular 

3092
02:17:54,281 --> 02:17:57,460
stimulation devices and they just jack 
them through the roof.

3093
02:17:58,180 --> 02:18:02,050
That could have put one in there.
Yeah.

3094
02:18:02,051 --> 02:18:05,290
Well they put them in their abdomen just
getting torn apart,

3095
02:18:06,630 --> 02:18:08,560
but it's not even as sensitive as your 
vagina.

3096
02:18:08,561 --> 02:18:09,394
So it's.
Plus you're probably not making like 

3097
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:13,900
nothing.
Yeah,

3098
02:18:13,910 --> 02:18:14,743
it's nothing.
And he's getting up on his hands and 

3099
02:18:15,471 --> 02:18:16,370
knees like,
come on,

3100
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:18,810
stop.
Yeah.

3101
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:19,753
They just basically torturing these men 
to make them feel bad for not being a 

3102
02:18:23,541 --> 02:18:24,374
woman.

3103
02:18:28,430 --> 02:18:32,630
It's definitely a painful process.
That whole delivery thing.

3104
02:18:32,631 --> 02:18:34,970
It's painful,
but it is pretty crazy.

3105
02:18:35,150 --> 02:18:35,983
It's definitely crazy.
It's really crazy that people make 

3106
02:18:37,461 --> 02:18:39,980
people in their bodies.
You know?

3107
02:18:39,981 --> 02:18:41,840
Like I was talking to my daughter this 
morning,

3108
02:18:41,841 --> 02:18:45,740
she was getting ready for school and 
we're sitting at the breakfast table and

3109
02:18:45,741 --> 02:18:47,540
I'm just looking at her and while she's 
talking,

3110
02:18:47,560 --> 02:18:52,560
all I'm thinking of is you didn't use to
exist and now here you are talking to me

3111
02:18:52,791 --> 02:18:53,624
about school,
talk to me about this and that and all 

3112
02:18:56,001 --> 02:18:56,834
the different things you're doing and it
is so odd that you are a combination of 

3113
02:19:02,331 --> 02:19:06,260
my DNA and my wife's DNA and here you 
are just sitting here eating breakfast,

3114
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:10,470
just talking 10 years old now,
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah,

3115
02:19:10,471 --> 02:19:10,790
blah,
blah,

3116
02:19:10,790 --> 02:19:14,480
blah.
Then she tells jokes yet she's not that.

3117
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:15,080
Well,
she'll,

3118
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:15,913
she'll tell jokes,
but my eight year old's fucking 

3119
02:19:17,601 --> 02:19:18,530
hilarious.

3120
02:19:18,830 --> 02:19:21,140
The eight year old has figured out how 
to be funny.

3121
02:19:21,860 --> 02:19:24,890
She farts on cue like she'll.
She'll tell you.

3122
02:19:24,891 --> 02:19:26,240
She's got to tell you something,
Daddy,

3123
02:19:26,241 --> 02:19:28,130
I have to tell you.
Come here.

3124
02:19:28,131 --> 02:19:31,940
I tell you some fall.
Follow the ground.

3125
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:35,060
She thinks it's so funny.
She thinks she's.

3126
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:37,640
She's really funny.
She says funny shit.

3127
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:38,893
She's a very funny person.
Maybe she's got a little bit what some 

3128
02:19:41,421 --> 02:19:43,010
of the DNA from you is a little more 
active.

3129
02:19:43,070 --> 02:19:47,140
I don't know.
I think it's like she knows how to get a

3130
02:19:47,510 --> 02:19:49,640
positive response out of people,
you know,

3131
02:19:49,790 --> 02:19:52,070
she knows how to be silly and she loves 
that.

3132
02:19:52,190 --> 02:19:54,920
She's really silly with her friends and 
she's just like,

3133
02:19:55,160 --> 02:19:57,740
she's the comedian amongst her friends 
for sure.

3134
02:19:57,741 --> 02:19:58,640
Cool.
Yeah.

3135
02:19:58,940 --> 02:20:00,620
Whereas my 10 year old's not really that
funny,

3136
02:20:01,370 --> 02:20:03,470
but just.
I wouldn't say she's not that funny.

3137
02:20:03,471 --> 02:20:04,370
She doesn't try.

3138
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:05,383
It's not something she works at.
It's also interesting how they're so 

3139
02:20:07,131 --> 02:20:11,060
different and they're like the same 
environment couldn't be more different.

3140
02:20:11,390 --> 02:20:12,223
Right out of the box.
They come out with their own little 

3141
02:20:13,281 --> 02:20:14,630
personality.
Like when they were tiny,

3142
02:20:14,631 --> 02:20:16,700
tiny babies.
You could see that there are different,

3143
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:18,770
you know,
I bet if you had 10 of them,

3144
02:20:18,771 --> 02:20:21,770
like those crazy people that was 
duggar's that have like 19 kids.

3145
02:20:22,050 --> 02:20:23,690
I bet they got 19 different humans.
I,

3146
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:26,310
but they're all totally different,
you know,

3147
02:20:26,410 --> 02:20:28,340
a bit one.
I like Mike's like shelly,

3148
02:20:28,590 --> 02:20:30,150
whether they're probably like kind of 
close.

3149
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:33,070
It's just,
it's A.

3150
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:34,273
I mean I wished that it made sense.
I wish I could get a view of the human 

3151
02:20:41,330 --> 02:20:46,330
organism from high enough above that.
It all made sense and I and I could say,

3152
02:20:47,210 --> 02:20:48,043
oh,
all these little varying pieces are 

3153
02:20:50,481 --> 02:20:55,481
working in conjunction with each other 
and this is why things get done and this

3154
02:20:56,871 --> 02:21:00,500
is why art gets created and,
and buildings get built because you have

3155
02:21:00,501 --> 02:21:01,334
to have a this and then you have to have
that and they work together and you 

3156
02:21:04,881 --> 02:21:07,370
know,
I mean that's like personalities,

3157
02:21:07,371 --> 02:21:09,620
right?
In terms of relationships.

3158
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:12,560
Like you don't want to have two bowls,
right?

3159
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:13,513
You know,
you have one who's like this and the 

3160
02:21:14,991 --> 02:21:15,824
other like that.
And together they make this one thing 

3161
02:21:16,941 --> 02:21:21,941
that's really nice and we've both seen,
I'm sure people that are just not,

3162
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:25,910
they might be really great people,
but together they're terrible.

3163
02:21:26,380 --> 02:21:28,580
Right?
Just for whatever reason.

3164
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:30,830
Yeah,
for sure.

3165
02:21:30,910 --> 02:21:32,870
It's fascinating.
So

3166
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:34,830
sober October.
Yes.

3167
02:21:35,340 --> 02:21:36,173
You're going to be doing some.
I did I tell you about some of the new 

3168
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:38,673
stuff in the brain.

3169
02:21:38,740 --> 02:21:39,573
No new stuff.
How new past year ask you before we get 

3170
02:21:43,961 --> 02:21:45,400
going,
is there a difference?

3171
02:21:45,401 --> 02:21:46,234
But because I keep this keeps coming up,
is there any beneficial difference 

3172
02:21:48,821 --> 02:21:52,960
between infrared versus standard?
Well,

3173
02:21:53,530 --> 02:21:54,363
one of the studies that I referred to 
and that had been published have been 

3174
02:21:57,431 --> 02:21:59,110
using a standard,
right.

3175
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:00,240
And,
and the,

3176
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:03,590
they definitely work differently.
I mean the standard standard Hodson I,

3177
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:05,800
you're,
you're heating up the air and you're,

3178
02:22:05,801 --> 02:22:06,200
so,
you're,

3179
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:07,630
you're,
you're getting hot.

3180
02:22:07,990 --> 02:22:10,630
Whereas the infrared is like,
it's like using,

3181
02:22:10,631 --> 02:22:12,210
it's like wavelengths that are like,
you know,

3182
02:22:12,370 --> 02:22:13,203
stimulating electrons that are sort of 
changing things and heating up you from 

3183
02:22:15,941 --> 02:22:17,770
a different sort of way.
So I,

3184
02:22:17,830 --> 02:22:21,160
but I do think that the key is the heat 
stress itself.

3185
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:23,730
Um,
uh,

3186
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:24,613
the personally I,
that the standard is better because you 

3187
02:22:28,561 --> 02:22:30,450
get,
it's easier to get more hot,

3188
02:22:30,510 --> 02:22:31,920
more discomfort,
more heat stress.

3189
02:22:32,440 --> 02:22:34,590
It takes a lot longer in an infrared 
sauna to,

3190
02:22:34,610 --> 02:22:36,660
to really heat up,
at least in my experience,

3191
02:22:36,690 --> 02:22:39,030
they only go up to 140 or something 
Fahrenheit.

3192
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:40,433
And a lot of benefits come from like one
80 when you get up to like a one 80 

3193
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:44,213
Fahrenheit.

3194
02:22:44,650 --> 02:22:48,660
My cranks,
I have to mind your one out here.

3195
02:22:48,690 --> 02:22:49,590
You're a regular,
you're hot.

3196
02:22:49,591 --> 02:22:51,810
You're right.
That thing gets too fucking hot.

3197
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:53,153
It gets to 200 all the time.
That's what I have to open up the door 

3198
02:22:55,770 --> 02:22:59,550
to your ears start to hurt and it's not 
even my feet hurt again,

3199
02:22:59,551 --> 02:23:02,980
it's not even close to pegged.
Like in terms of like the,

3200
02:23:02,981 --> 02:23:04,440
the,
the full temperature one,

3201
02:23:04,650 --> 02:23:06,900
I just have a really hot one.
Yeah.

3202
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:09,410
So I think that heats really important.
Like one of the leg.

3203
02:23:10,140 --> 02:23:10,891
Yeah,
exactly.

3204
02:23:10,891 --> 02:23:11,724
One 80 for 20 minutes is where it sort 
of like a lot of studies published by 

3205
02:23:16,201 --> 02:23:18,710
like Dr Dre,
you are locking in Finland.

3206
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:20,940
He's shown a lot of benefits.
Um,

3207
02:23:20,970 --> 02:23:21,803
he's,
a lot of his studies have been 

3208
02:23:22,890 --> 02:23:23,723
observational,
but he's also done some intervention 

3209
02:23:25,321 --> 02:23:27,180
trials as well.
Um,

3210
02:23:27,270 --> 02:23:28,103
the observational studies,
we've talked about improvements in 

3211
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:32,640
cardiac,
cardiovascular related mortality.

3212
02:23:32,910 --> 02:23:34,400
Allison,
like literally like people,

3213
02:23:34,410 --> 02:23:35,243
people do it four to seven times a week.
They have like a 50 percent improvement 

3214
02:23:37,231 --> 02:23:39,490
in cardiovascular rate of mortality,
um,

3215
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:41,670
three to four,
three to four times a week,

3216
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:42,983
or was it two to get three to four times
a week to three times a week is like 24 

3217
02:23:45,511 --> 02:23:47,670
percent improvement.
So like a dose dependent manner,

3218
02:23:47,671 --> 02:23:48,504
Alzheimer's disease as well as reduced 
by like 60 percent if you do it four to 

3219
02:23:51,451 --> 02:23:53,580
seven times a week,
all cause mortality.

3220
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:54,773
But he's also done some intervention 
studies showing that like there's 

3221
02:23:56,251 --> 02:23:57,380
improvements,
um,

3222
02:23:57,390 --> 02:23:59,520
if even a single dose of,
of doing the sauna,

3223
02:23:59,950 --> 02:24:02,990
um,
improvements in the ability of your,

3224
02:24:02,991 --> 02:24:03,824
your,
your blood vessels to contract and 

3225
02:24:05,431 --> 02:24:07,740
expand with pressure changes,
which is important.

3226
02:24:07,741 --> 02:24:08,574
So it's like vascular compliance.
It's called improvements in blood 

3227
02:24:10,861 --> 02:24:14,810
pressure decreases in,
in a Syriac.

3228
02:24:14,820 --> 02:24:15,653
The protein inflammatory biomarker 
studies have been showing recently in 

3229
02:24:19,251 --> 02:24:21,900
humans increase in mitochondrial 
biogenesis,

3230
02:24:21,901 --> 02:24:23,730
growing new healthy Mitochondria.

3231
02:24:24,330 --> 02:24:26,980
Improvements in mitochondrial function,
um,

3232
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:28,793
and then also improve in improvements in
a anti inflammatory cytokines being 

3233
02:24:33,451 --> 02:24:35,370
increased in these are all intervention 
trials as well.

3234
02:24:36,270 --> 02:24:40,080
People that are doing it with a before 
doing a workout,

3235
02:24:40,110 --> 02:24:41,680
which is interesting because I've always
done after.

3236
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:42,870
Yeah.
So,

3237
02:24:42,870 --> 02:24:44,370
so,
so doing it before workout,

3238
02:24:44,390 --> 02:24:47,400
it reduced delayed onset muscle 
soreness.

3239
02:24:47,850 --> 02:24:48,683
I'm doing it before a workout,
which is weird because 20 minutes 

3240
02:24:50,731 --> 02:24:51,564
before,
I don't remember the exact amount of 

3241
02:24:53,341 --> 02:24:55,140
time.
I think that um,

3242
02:24:55,950 --> 02:24:58,590
it was a little bit of a different 
protocol for that study.

3243
02:24:59,190 --> 02:25:01,080
I can't remember off the top of my head.
Uh,

3244
02:25:01,081 --> 02:25:02,960
I did tweet it at some point.
Um,

3245
02:25:03,540 --> 02:25:04,373
but yeah,
it's really interesting because I doing 

3246
02:25:06,451 --> 02:25:07,284
it before it seems like I'm so burnt out
like after doing the sauna it's like 

3247
02:25:10,350 --> 02:25:11,183
going into a workout after that.
So maybe would they have the same 

3248
02:25:13,201 --> 02:25:15,210
effects effects afterwards after,
you know,

3249
02:25:15,240 --> 02:25:16,050
doing it afterwards?

3250
02:25:16,050 --> 02:25:16,883
Possibly.
But what's super interesting is the 

3251
02:25:19,441 --> 02:25:22,020
effects on the brain,
like have you noticed,

3252
02:25:22,021 --> 02:25:24,100
do,
do you feel any feel great?

3253
02:25:24,410 --> 02:25:25,243
Yeah.
When I come out of there I feel just 

3254
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:27,310
chilled out,
relaxed,

3255
02:25:27,311 --> 02:25:28,900
I feel.
I feel really good.

3256
02:25:28,901 --> 02:25:31,870
I just feel good.
I feel alleviated.

3257
02:25:31,990 --> 02:25:34,660
That's exactly the reason I even got 
interested in Sana was I,

3258
02:25:34,690 --> 02:25:35,523
that was,
I was doing it regularly and I started 

3259
02:25:36,551 --> 02:25:40,630
to notice that I'm.
But I recently met up with a researcher.

3260
02:25:40,631 --> 02:25:43,160
His name is Dr Charles Raison,
um,

3261
02:25:43,210 --> 02:25:45,550
I recorded a podcast with him.
Very interesting guy,

3262
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:46,713
but he,
a devised this really cool gadget where 

3263
02:25:51,131 --> 02:25:55,030
he could elevate people's core body 
temperature by like a,

3264
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:58,690
a degree and a half,
but he had a sham control,

3265
02:25:58,710 --> 02:25:59,920
a placebo,
so to speak.

3266
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:01,480
And um,
so,

3267
02:26:01,510 --> 02:26:05,200
so the placebo did increase people's 
core body temperature a little bit,

3268
02:26:05,201 --> 02:26:07,420
but not to that amount,
not to that degree.

3269
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:11,280
So people thought they were getting the 
active treatment so they weren't hot.

3270
02:26:11,820 --> 02:26:13,150
They were,
they thought they were getting high.

3271
02:26:13,151 --> 02:26:15,970
And in fact he said when asked 
afterwards,

3272
02:26:15,971 --> 02:26:18,160
like 70 percent of them thought they got
the active treatment.

3273
02:26:19,330 --> 02:26:20,163
So yeah,
so it's actually a nice placebo 

3274
02:26:21,761 --> 02:26:23,670
controlled study.
But um,

3275
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:25,360
what he found was that even a single 
treatment,

3276
02:26:25,660 --> 02:26:27,940
these weren't people that had major 
depressive disorder.

3277
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:31,330
It improved depressive symptoms like 
even a week,

3278
02:26:31,330 --> 02:26:32,830
week after.
And this was just a single,

3279
02:26:33,360 --> 02:26:35,200
you know,
exposure to the sauna,

3280
02:26:35,320 --> 02:26:37,690
what sauna.
It's not actually a sign I was like this

3281
02:26:37,691 --> 02:26:39,820
like heating device.
But um,

3282
02:26:39,970 --> 02:26:43,210
he also measured their,
a cytokine called io six,

3283
02:26:43,330 --> 02:26:46,740
which is something that's released from 
exercise muscle tissue releases.

3284
02:26:46,750 --> 02:26:51,750
It spills out into the bloodstream and 
it's part of the inflammatory response,

3285
02:26:52,870 --> 02:26:55,180
part of the inflammatory aspect of 
exercise.

3286
02:26:55,570 --> 02:26:58,040
And in response there's a whole 
anti-inflammatory,

3287
02:26:58,450 --> 02:26:59,380
um,
effect.

3288
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:00,630
And so,
um,

3289
02:27:00,670 --> 02:27:04,330
what he showed is that actually people 
with the more aisle six that happened,

3290
02:27:04,570 --> 02:27:05,890
the better they had,
um,

3291
02:27:06,350 --> 02:27:10,090
antidepressant effect.
So it's super interesting because,

3292
02:27:10,110 --> 02:27:10,691
uh,
again,

3293
02:27:10,691 --> 02:27:13,960
exercise does that and in fact,
if you give people ensades or like,

3294
02:27:14,010 --> 02:27:17,170
you know,
so nonsteroidal anti inflammatories,

3295
02:27:17,750 --> 02:27:19,060
um,
and,

3296
02:27:19,260 --> 02:27:20,093
and before exercise,
it actually blunts the aisle six 

3297
02:27:23,021 --> 02:27:23,854
production and it blends some of the 
positive benefits like insulin 

3298
02:27:25,541 --> 02:27:28,150
sensitivity.
So the aisle six,

3299
02:27:28,151 --> 02:27:31,060
although it's an inflammatory cytokine,
it's kind of like this,

3300
02:27:31,450 --> 02:27:34,810
a sort of a pleiotropic one that it's 
released,

3301
02:27:34,811 --> 02:27:35,644
it's in muscle tissue,
it's released and it seems to like 

3302
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:38,013
increase,
have a big anti inflammatory response 

3303
02:27:40,811 --> 02:27:44,740
that happens in response to that.
So it was really interesting because the

3304
02:27:44,741 --> 02:27:45,574
inflammation seems to be really 
important for depression and that the 

3305
02:27:48,671 --> 02:27:49,840
sauna was like,
you know,

3306
02:27:49,870 --> 02:27:53,620
basically basically lowering markers of 
inflammation.

3307
02:27:53,621 --> 02:27:57,460
So it's been shown to lower c reactor 
protein and then also increase aisle 10.

3308
02:27:58,030 --> 02:28:02,050
So it's a very interesting kind of 
connection between mood,

3309
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:03,220
um,
heat stress.

3310
02:28:03,221 --> 02:28:04,840
And then of course exercise is the same 
thing.

3311
02:28:04,841 --> 02:28:07,480
Exercise does elevate your core body 
temperature and heats you up.

3312
02:28:07,750 --> 02:28:08,583
And I asked,
uh,

3313
02:28:08,590 --> 02:28:11,050
Dr Liaison,
he thinks that things like the sauna,

3314
02:28:11,051 --> 02:28:12,580
hot yoga,
hot bath,

3315
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:13,473
steam room,
all those things are pretty much can 

3316
02:28:15,401 --> 02:28:17,680
give you the same effect.
The point is the heat stress,

3317
02:28:17,710 --> 02:28:18,543
it's,
I'm pretty sure that yoga does the same 

3318
02:28:20,350 --> 02:28:22,160
with hot yoga because I have that same

3319
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:24,080
feeling when I get out of a hot yoga 
class.

3320
02:28:24,400 --> 02:28:25,233
It,
this is like really good alleviation 

3321
02:28:27,321 --> 02:28:28,190
feeling.
I just,

3322
02:28:28,430 --> 02:28:29,263
my mood feels elevated,
I feel happier and it feels different 

3323
02:28:32,361 --> 02:28:35,120
than a regular workout,
like regular workout does that.

3324
02:28:35,121 --> 02:28:36,520
But it seems more,
uh,

3325
02:28:36,570 --> 02:28:38,420
an alleviation of stress.
Like,

3326
02:28:38,421 --> 02:28:39,254
I've expelled the excess energy in my 
body and I can relax and there's 

3327
02:28:42,290 --> 02:28:44,580
certainly some sort of,
um,

3328
02:28:44,860 --> 02:28:45,693
uh,
some sort of a positive hormonal effect 

3329
02:28:49,850 --> 02:28:51,510
after it's over.
You know,

3330
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:55,280
some endorphin rush.
But it's not the same as the yoga.

3331
02:28:55,310 --> 02:28:56,143
The hot yoga I think is very addictive 
to people and that's one of the reasons 

3332
02:28:58,911 --> 02:29:01,190
because after it's over,
you feel amazing.

3333
02:29:01,191 --> 02:29:02,200
You feel so good.

3334
02:29:02,460 --> 02:29:05,430
There's studies showing that hot yoga 
does improve depressive symptoms.

3335
02:29:05,431 --> 02:29:06,500
They're not,
there's no plus,

3336
02:29:06,530 --> 02:29:07,710
you know,
sham control.

3337
02:29:07,980 --> 02:29:08,813
I think there's a researcher at Harvard 
Public School of Health who's trying to 

3338
02:29:12,121 --> 02:29:12,954
develop,
trying to do a study with how you're 

3339
02:29:14,701 --> 02:29:15,534
doing it right now.
Are they with her with a control random 

3340
02:29:17,071 --> 02:29:18,400
and now they're in the

3341
02:29:18,700 --> 02:29:21,670
about yoga is that it's only 104 degrees
in the room.

3342
02:29:21,940 --> 02:29:26,770
But when you take into account the 
extreme condition of the exercise,

3343
02:29:26,771 --> 02:29:28,450
extreme stress that you're putting on 
your body,

3344
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:29,553
a lot of it is like really difficult 
balancing and you're straining and all 

3345
02:29:32,411 --> 02:29:33,244
your mind,
your fucking sweating and you're not 

3346
02:29:35,140 --> 02:29:36,580
sweating like 100,
four degrees.

3347
02:29:36,581 --> 02:29:38,530
You're sweating just like you're 
sweating inside the song,

3348
02:29:38,531 --> 02:29:38,920
right?

3349
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:40,250
Like big time sweat.
Yeah,

3350
02:29:40,251 --> 02:29:41,084
yeah,
yeah,

3351
02:29:41,170 --> 02:29:41,490
yeah.

3352
02:29:41,490 --> 02:29:45,150
Like there's certain ones that are like,
when you're do a bouncing stick,

3353
02:29:45,151 --> 02:29:45,984
what?
I'm standing in front of me like this 

3354
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:51,780
and I'm watching it just pour off my 
arms just watching sweat drip off me.

3355
02:29:52,070 --> 02:29:52,903
I sweat when I'm doing yoga,
like non what I'm holding those 

3356
02:29:55,611 --> 02:29:57,770
positions in a non hot environment,
you know.

3357
02:29:57,771 --> 02:29:58,604
So I haven't,
I've done a big room yoga a couple of 

3358
02:30:00,141 --> 02:30:00,974
times.
I've been the hot yoga a couple of 

3359
02:30:01,581 --> 02:30:02,700
times.
Um,

3360
02:30:02,810 --> 02:30:03,643
I do really like it instead of have more
time to see what might be minutes is a 

3361
02:30:07,311 --> 02:30:09,330
long time.
Um,

3362
02:30:09,380 --> 02:30:10,580
but,
but the Endorphin,

3363
02:30:10,610 --> 02:30:13,640
you dump a bunch of endorphins with uh,
the sauna as well,

3364
02:30:13,641 --> 02:30:15,320
like tons and tons.
And then there's the whole,

3365
02:30:15,321 --> 02:30:16,400
like,
you're,

3366
02:30:16,430 --> 02:30:17,263
you're making dynorphins which is the 
sort of opposite of endorphin 

3367
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:21,650
responsible for that.
Um,

3368
02:30:21,970 --> 02:30:26,970
so that changes some of the least in 
animal studies at Petronas to change the

3369
02:30:27,861 --> 02:30:32,240
sensitivity to endorphins.
I'm from the receptor standpoint.

3370
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:35,750
So it's kind of interesting.
That's kind of initially what I,

3371
02:30:35,810 --> 02:30:36,643
what I originally was looking into when 
I was noticing all these benefits from 

3372
02:30:39,291 --> 02:30:41,660
the sauna,
but that's really cool that you're doing

3373
02:30:41,661 --> 02:30:42,494
it because there's so many studies now 
showing that there's benefits on the 

3374
02:30:44,661 --> 02:30:46,400
cardiovascular health.

3375
02:30:46,430 --> 02:30:49,160
I'm also on neurogenic disease 
depression.

3376
02:30:49,161 --> 02:30:51,140
I mean the antiinflammatory effects as 
well.

3377
02:30:51,470 --> 02:30:55,040
It's so easy to have it.
I have it right here and just to be able

3378
02:30:55,140 --> 02:30:58,790
to get into the sauna anytime I want.
I basically doing it every day.

3379
02:30:58,820 --> 02:30:59,750
That's nice.
Yeah.

3380
02:30:59,870 --> 02:31:02,480
Right now I've been taking hot baths 
just because I haven't,

3381
02:31:03,110 --> 02:31:03,720
we're,
we're,

3382
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:06,690
we're trying to like get to the point 
where we have a sauna but um,

3383
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:10,700
I think we're gonna get there soon.
But a hot baths had been doing it for me

3384
02:31:10,701 --> 02:31:13,160
as well where I am like submerge my 
shoulders.

3385
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:14,473
I mean you can't,
like if you start putting your arms and 

3386
02:31:15,561 --> 02:31:16,394
legs out of the water,
like it doesn't count because I feel 

3387
02:31:18,231 --> 02:31:20,460
cooler if you'd like stay underneath.

3388
02:31:20,480 --> 02:31:22,680
I mean you're freaking out.
You're heart starts racing,

3389
02:31:23,310 --> 02:31:24,143
racing.
I mean it's like the same effect that 

3390
02:31:24,961 --> 02:31:29,961
happens where you're elevated heart rate
and all those sort of similar mechanisms

3391
02:31:29,971 --> 02:31:32,280
kick into play like they do when you're 
in a sauna.

3392
02:31:32,340 --> 02:31:34,830
Do you do epsom salt baths as well?
I have.

3393
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:35,783
I really like them,
but I've been doing really hot baths 

3394
02:31:37,591 --> 02:31:38,424
with epsom salts,
especially like after a very fatiguing 

3395
02:31:41,041 --> 02:31:45,270
workouts seems to have a good benefit 
and and I know from the tank,

3396
02:31:45,271 --> 02:31:48,570
from the isolation tank that it's a 
great way of absorbing magnesium through

3397
02:31:48,571 --> 02:31:49,610
the epsom salts.
Oh,

3398
02:31:49,650 --> 02:31:50,483
into your muscle through through skin,
because epsom salts is so high in 

3399
02:31:54,301 --> 02:31:59,301
magnesium in the tank is a thousand 
pounds of epsom salts in it.

3400
02:32:00,120 --> 02:32:03,620
It's crazy to make your skin look nice 
when you do it.

3401
02:32:04,750 --> 02:32:06,030
Yeah,
it just feels good too,

3402
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:08,700
but it's a.
It feels really the tank.

3403
02:32:08,730 --> 02:32:11,220
Have you done it yet?
I did it once.

3404
02:32:11,310 --> 02:32:12,143
I'm in San Francisco and you can do it 
anytime you want if you want to come 

3405
02:32:16,561 --> 02:32:17,394
here.
I think it was really something wasn't 

3406
02:32:20,911 --> 02:32:21,744
right because I could feel like the 
temperature of the water was off and I 

3407
02:32:25,861 --> 02:32:27,330
did enjoy what I.
what,

3408
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:28,253
I mean it was nice.
So at first I got in and they had some 

3409
02:32:29,641 --> 02:32:32,850
music playing music and then the music 
went away.

3410
02:32:32,940 --> 02:32:34,850
Oh,
to sort of relax you at first.

3411
02:32:34,851 --> 02:32:36,020
Yeah.
Um,

3412
02:32:36,450 --> 02:32:38,790
but uh,
I did,

3413
02:32:38,791 --> 02:32:42,180
I was like sort of in my head a bit,
you know,

3414
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:43,073
in that.
But I didn't,

3415
02:32:43,090 --> 02:32:43,923
I kept feeling the water and I thought I
didn't feel like I was like sensory 

3416
02:32:45,691 --> 02:32:46,524
deprived if you ever hear other than 
like when you come down and do the 

3417
02:32:49,201 --> 02:32:51,300
podcast.
Um,

3418
02:32:51,360 --> 02:32:52,200
yeah,
I do.

3419
02:32:52,201 --> 02:32:53,034
I'm coming back in November.
Anytime you're here just let me know in 

3420
02:32:55,621 --> 02:32:57,150
advance and we'll open it up.

3421
02:32:57,150 --> 02:32:57,983
And this tank here is the best.
The float lab or if you want to go to 

3422
02:33:00,961 --> 02:33:01,794
the place in Venice,
but the one you can do here so easy and 

3423
02:33:03,511 --> 02:33:04,830
it's got a shower in there and 
everything.

3424
02:33:04,831 --> 02:33:05,640
Yeah,
that would be cool.

3425
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:07,380
I would like to try it again.
Yeah,

3426
02:33:07,560 --> 02:33:08,960
I mean there's studies showing,
you know,

3427
02:33:08,970 --> 02:33:11,360
meditation and all that stuff is really 
important for it.

3428
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:12,233
I think it's an important one.
One of the many components and like 

3429
02:33:15,991 --> 02:33:17,520
healthy aging,
healthy brain aging,

3430
02:33:17,521 --> 02:33:19,830
lowering stress and stuff.
Um,

3431
02:33:20,100 --> 02:33:23,070
so I would definitely like to get out of
that thing.

3432
02:33:23,071 --> 02:33:25,140
I feel great.
I'll come frequently.

3433
02:33:25,141 --> 02:33:25,974
So that's right here.
So I'll come down here early in the 

3434
02:33:28,710 --> 02:33:30,570
morning and do it sometimes.
How long do you have to stay in there to

3435
02:33:30,571 --> 02:33:33,660
really.
I like at least an hour,

3436
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:36,930
but I really like to do two hours.
Two hours for me is the sweet spot.

3437
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:39,380
When I come out after two hours I'm just
like,

3438
02:33:39,570 --> 02:33:43,200
so chill out and it's almost like doing 
sober October.

3439
02:33:43,201 --> 02:33:45,570
It's like cheating because you're 
basically getting high in there.

3440
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:47,490
Are you doing it during.
So it worked out,

3441
02:33:47,491 --> 02:33:48,930
but yeah,
I mean it's not,

3442
02:33:49,050 --> 02:33:53,070
you're not taking a drug but you're so 
chilled out,

3443
02:33:53,400 --> 02:33:54,233
you know,
and you do have a weird psychedelic 

3444
02:33:55,471 --> 02:33:56,304
state that you achieve when you.
It's like a very extreme form of 

3445
02:33:59,401 --> 02:34:00,234
meditation and a lot of ways because of 
the fact that you're not feeling your 

3446
02:34:02,641 --> 02:34:03,474
body at all and it's,
you're only experiencing whatever's 

3447
02:34:06,661 --> 02:34:07,494
going on.
It's like your brain detached from all 

3448
02:34:10,141 --> 02:34:12,450
the input of the body.
Some of those,

3449
02:34:12,510 --> 02:34:13,343
some of those studies that have been 
done on like long term meditators or 

3450
02:34:16,021 --> 02:34:17,980
even just people that haven't meditated

3451
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:19,083
and then they're put in like some like 
eight week trial of meditation and how 

3452
02:34:22,151 --> 02:34:22,984
there's like immediately all these 
changes in brain activity start to 

3453
02:34:25,541 --> 02:34:30,541
happen like that are basically in line 
with good brain aging and improved.

3454
02:34:31,661 --> 02:34:32,494
You know,
all sorts of measures or measures have 

3455
02:34:33,401 --> 02:34:37,420
improved cognitive function and stuff.
It's super interesting.

3456
02:34:37,690 --> 02:34:39,340
It would be really interesting to see 
like,

3457
02:34:39,970 --> 02:34:43,010
you know what,
how that differs from meditations.

3458
02:34:43,030 --> 02:34:44,820
One thing I have a hard time with like I
real,

3459
02:34:44,821 --> 02:34:45,950
it's well,
meditation and

3460
02:34:46,070 --> 02:34:48,310
injunction with the tank I think is 
really the key.

3461
02:34:48,440 --> 02:34:51,970
I think the tank allows you to achieve a
state of physical,

3462
02:34:52,150 --> 02:34:52,983
your physical body not being or not I.
You don't ever completely eliminate the 

3463
02:35:00,131 --> 02:35:00,964
sensory input,
but you diminish it so significantly 

3464
02:35:03,791 --> 02:35:04,624
that that environment is not available 
anywhere else on earth where you're 

3465
02:35:07,031 --> 02:35:07,864
floating so you don't feel your body.
Your water is the temperature of your 

3466
02:35:11,501 --> 02:35:12,334
skin.
The air is the same temperature as the 

3467
02:35:13,571 --> 02:35:17,080
water and you feel like just flying 
through infinity,

3468
02:35:17,290 --> 02:35:19,090
you're in total darkness.
Total silence.

3469
02:35:19,170 --> 02:35:20,190
Yeah.
I didn't feel that way.

3470
02:35:20,780 --> 02:35:22,590
I mean I did.
It was a little relaxed.

3471
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:24,800
I didn't feel like I was like flying 
through

3472
02:35:25,550 --> 02:35:26,570
for tanks.
That's,

3473
02:35:26,590 --> 02:35:28,510
that's part of the problem.
Some of the tanks,

3474
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:29,673
the water the entire time,
they're probably either too cold or too 

3475
02:35:32,481 --> 02:35:32,990
hot.

3476
02:35:32,990 --> 02:35:33,823
It should.
You feel like your brain is like a in 

3477
02:35:35,991 --> 02:35:37,610
the now when you're doing it.
Is that something.

3478
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:38,473
I feel like my brain is has way more 
resource reece way more resources 

3479
02:35:43,851 --> 02:35:44,684
available to it.
So like if you and I are having this 

3480
02:35:47,091 --> 02:35:47,924
conversation and we didn't have the 
headphones on and there was a Jack 

3481
02:35:50,810 --> 02:35:52,730
Hammer next to us,
it would be really distracting.

3482
02:35:52,731 --> 02:35:54,080
You'd want to get away from that 
Jackhammer,

3483
02:35:54,110 --> 02:35:56,060
like let's go talk over here until you'd
want.

3484
02:35:56,090 --> 02:35:58,010
You'd want to get away as far as you 
could from.

3485
02:35:58,310 --> 02:35:59,143
But everything is a distraction.
Like the seat on my butt is a 

3486
02:36:02,631 --> 02:36:06,020
distraction with the shoes on my feet or
something.

3487
02:36:06,021 --> 02:36:09,380
I'm thinking about the watch on my hand.
Does all these different things that are

3488
02:36:09,381 --> 02:36:11,480
distracting you,
but when you get in that tank,

3489
02:36:11,481 --> 02:36:13,910
there's none of those things you're,
you're just,

3490
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:18,890
you settle in and once you settle in,
you touch each side so that you can,

3491
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:20,840
you know,
because you get in the waters like a few

3492
02:36:20,841 --> 02:36:25,400
whip ripples and little little waves and
then you touch each side.

3493
02:36:25,400 --> 02:36:29,930
So you calm everything down and then I 
sink into the water and then I take some

3494
02:36:29,931 --> 02:36:32,520
deep breaths and then I slowly bring my 
arms,

3495
02:36:32,570 --> 02:36:36,920
the middle and then a chill out and I've
done it so many times my body's goes,

3496
02:36:36,921 --> 02:36:38,330
okay,
here we go again.

3497
02:36:38,390 --> 02:36:39,620
Like it's not like,
Whoa,

3498
02:36:39,621 --> 02:36:41,540
what is this?
This is a weird.

3499
02:36:42,020 --> 02:36:47,020
I've done it so many times that my body 
gets into that state very quickly.

3500
02:36:47,091 --> 02:36:47,924
But if I take time off and I do,
sometimes I'll take weeks or even a 

3501
02:36:50,391 --> 02:36:53,450
month off and then it's a little more 
weird at first.

3502
02:36:53,451 --> 02:36:53,841
Like,
oh,

3503
02:36:53,841 --> 02:36:55,070
we're doing this again.
Oh,

3504
02:36:55,071 --> 02:36:55,904
I haven't done this in awhile,
but when I do it consistently on a 

3505
02:36:58,131 --> 02:37:02,270
regular basis to three times a week,
then I could just sink right into it.

3506
02:37:02,540 --> 02:37:03,373
I wonder if it would be any therapeutic 
benefit to people with like sensory 

3507
02:37:05,871 --> 02:37:08,240
gating disorders,
sensory gating,

3508
02:37:08,330 --> 02:37:09,020
our,
you know,

3509
02:37:09,020 --> 02:37:11,200
in other words,
like you were mentioning all the senses,

3510
02:37:11,270 --> 02:37:13,730
other sensory things that are happening,
you know,

3511
02:37:13,731 --> 02:37:15,080
there's auditory,
there's,

3512
02:37:15,890 --> 02:37:16,723
there's a visual.
I mean these things are our brains 

3513
02:37:18,201 --> 02:37:19,034
inputting it at all times.
I mean there's stuff going on but we're 

3514
02:37:20,871 --> 02:37:23,450
able to kind of filter it out and like 
you and I are having this conversation.

3515
02:37:23,451 --> 02:37:24,284
Jamie's been sitting over the whole time
and like I really haven't paid much 

3516
02:37:25,941 --> 02:37:26,720
attention,
right.

3517
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:27,553
Attention thing.
But some people like particularly 

3518
02:37:29,871 --> 02:37:31,640
schizophrenia,
people with schizophrenia,

3519
02:37:31,760 --> 02:37:33,590
they can't,
they don't filter that out.

3520
02:37:33,591 --> 02:37:37,430
And so like they get overlooked but gets
like an overload.

3521
02:37:37,431 --> 02:37:39,500
It's called sensory overload.
And so they oftentimes,

3522
02:37:39,501 --> 02:37:41,360
I can't go into like a room with a lot 
of people.

3523
02:37:41,361 --> 02:37:44,150
They want to like go off and you know,
with,

3524
02:37:44,280 --> 02:37:45,410
you know,
by themselves or whatever.

3525
02:37:45,411 --> 02:37:46,244
So I wonder if there's any sort of a 
benefit for like doing something like 

3526
02:37:50,751 --> 02:37:52,310
that where you're,
where you're not,

3527
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:54,320
you know,
the sensory inputs,

3528
02:37:54,321 --> 02:37:56,960
Kinda like if you could kind of train 
your brain a little bit.

3529
02:37:57,200 --> 02:37:58,460
I don't know.
I don't know.

3530
02:37:59,650 --> 02:38:00,483
Um,
I just,

3531
02:38:00,610 --> 02:38:02,480
I,
I find that for me it,

3532
02:38:02,481 --> 02:38:07,240
it helps me think way clear because I 
feel like I have more brain available to

3533
02:38:07,241 --> 02:38:08,074
access.
I feel like if you were trying to say 

3534
02:38:10,451 --> 02:38:11,284
something that was very,
very complicated and you're trying to 

3535
02:38:14,561 --> 02:38:17,410
explain something that required a lot of
the resources of your brain.

3536
02:38:17,411 --> 02:38:19,690
If there was a lot of noise around you,
you wouldn't be able to do it.

3537
02:38:19,930 --> 02:38:21,210
But if there was a lot of noise you 
like,

3538
02:38:21,220 --> 02:38:23,450
you want to eat,
let's go eat and you're like Bah Bah Bah

3539
02:38:23,450 --> 02:38:24,580
Bah Bah Ba.
Some Jack Hammer.

3540
02:38:24,750 --> 02:38:25,451
He,
I'm hungry.

3541
02:38:25,451 --> 02:38:26,171
You wanna eat.
Yeah,

3542
02:38:26,171 --> 02:38:27,004
let's go eat.
Like you could be able to communicate 

3543
02:38:28,061 --> 02:38:31,520
something very simple,
but if you were trying to explain the,

3544
02:38:31,610 --> 02:38:36,610
the various mechanisms are really try 
this because I think it

3545
02:38:37,270 --> 02:38:40,000
go through like this.
I also sometimes use the sauna for that.

3546
02:38:40,001 --> 02:38:43,450
We're all like,
have something prepared.

3547
02:38:44,260 --> 02:38:46,660
I used to actually,
before giving a presentation,

3548
02:38:46,661 --> 02:38:48,880
I would go in the sauna and I would go 
through it in my head,

3549
02:38:49,160 --> 02:38:50,200
you know,
so it's like,

3550
02:38:50,670 --> 02:38:51,503
you know,
that was something that I used to do a 

3551
02:38:52,541 --> 02:38:53,374
lot.

3552
02:38:54,180 --> 02:38:55,013
There's nothing in there,
just you sitting there and it gives you 

3553
02:38:57,721 --> 02:39:01,170
that unusual environment of just silence
really helped.

3554
02:39:01,171 --> 02:39:02,004
Yeah.
So it's kind of interesting that you 

3555
02:39:03,691 --> 02:39:07,020
mentioned that that's a step toward,
but I think the,

3556
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:12,080
the float tank is the ultimate and right
now there's a really interesting podcast

3557
02:39:12,481 --> 02:39:14,200
that's available.
Um,

3558
02:39:14,250 --> 02:39:15,780
I've,
I've talked with this podcast before,

3559
02:39:15,781 --> 02:39:17,880
stuff to blow your mind.
They have a,

3560
02:39:17,910 --> 02:39:22,230
an episode right now,
this week that is about John Lilly,

3561
02:39:22,590 --> 02:39:27,590
who was the psychedelic pioneer who 
created the sensory deprivation tank and

3562
02:39:27,751 --> 02:39:31,890
he also is a pioneer and interspecies 
communication.

3563
02:39:31,920 --> 02:39:32,753
Figured out how to communicate with 
dolphins and did a bunch of weird 

3564
02:39:36,511 --> 02:39:39,120
psychedelic research with dolphins.
Sarah is from the vault,

3565
02:39:39,150 --> 02:39:42,240
John C dot Lilly.
He a really amazing,

3566
02:39:42,241 --> 02:39:45,480
amazing guy who uh,
uh,

3567
02:39:45,500 --> 02:39:48,900
I mean if you go,
they go deep into the history of his,

3568
02:39:48,960 --> 02:39:52,380
his career too,
which is just very varied.

3569
02:39:52,590 --> 02:39:56,520
Fucking really strange guy,
but I think is his great contribution is

3570
02:39:56,521 --> 02:39:57,354
not just understanding the sentient 
nature of dolphins and how incredibly 

3571
02:40:01,831 --> 02:40:03,990
complex their languages and how smart 
they are,

3572
02:40:03,991 --> 02:40:04,824
but also the sensory deprivation tank,
which I think is one of the most 

3573
02:40:08,890 --> 02:40:09,723
underutilized tools for consciousness,
for exploring consciousness and just 

3574
02:40:13,500 --> 02:40:16,920
relaxation and for me for examining 
ideas.

3575
02:40:16,921 --> 02:40:17,754
If I have an idea like I used to do,
I just do a lot of Jujitsu and they're 

3576
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:21,713
like,
I would go into the tank and I would go 

3577
02:40:23,041 --> 02:40:25,770
over moves because when you're,
when you're completely,

3578
02:40:25,870 --> 02:40:26,703
I would,
I would drill moves in my head like as 

3579
02:40:30,121 --> 02:40:32,760
if I was doing them,
I would like clench,

3580
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:34,050
hook,
roll,

3581
02:40:34,080 --> 02:40:35,850
talk,
grab sync.

3582
02:40:36,090 --> 02:40:38,460
I would do all these different things in
my head.

3583
02:40:38,770 --> 02:40:40,080
Yeah.
And that would allow.

3584
02:40:40,081 --> 02:40:40,914
I would do that to get me to this like 
relaxation state and now or I would go 

3585
02:40:45,361 --> 02:40:48,460
over a joke that I'm struggling with or 
a comedy bit.

3586
02:40:48,470 --> 02:40:50,190
I'm like,
what is a better way to say this?

3587
02:40:50,210 --> 02:40:52,140
How's,
what's the best way to get this across?

3588
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:53,473
Now I'm saying it this way,
but it's offensive or it's blunt and 

3589
02:40:55,981 --> 02:40:58,230
it's not the funny part.
Like I'm,

3590
02:40:58,280 --> 02:41:00,420
I'm taking a shortcut.
Maybe I,

3591
02:41:00,980 --> 02:41:01,813
and then I would go over it in my head 
and then eventually once I would do 

3592
02:41:05,401 --> 02:41:06,234
that,
I would get to this relaxation point 

3593
02:41:08,730 --> 02:41:11,220
where then I could just concentrate only
on breathing.

3594
02:41:11,460 --> 02:41:12,293
So after I've worked out all the things 
that are bugging me and sometimes it 

3595
02:41:15,251 --> 02:41:18,630
would be like a seminar on my life,
I'd get in there.

3596
02:41:18,810 --> 02:41:22,350
And then as soon as I closed the door 
and lay down,

3597
02:41:22,351 --> 02:41:24,420
I'd take a few deep breaths and then 
it'd be like,

3598
02:41:24,900 --> 02:41:26,460
okay,
so here's what's wrong.

3599
02:41:26,461 --> 02:41:28,380
Fuck face.
You're doing too much of this,

3600
02:41:28,490 --> 02:41:30,070
cleaned you God damn office.
You know,

3601
02:41:30,140 --> 02:41:31,140
how come you,
uh,

3602
02:41:31,141 --> 02:41:34,770
you only get eight out of 10 things down
in your to do list that's bothering you.

3603
02:41:35,070 --> 02:41:35,903
You know,
you need to spend an hour a day just 

3604
02:41:37,411 --> 02:41:38,244
doing this.
And instead of drinking coffee and 

3605
02:41:40,471 --> 02:41:42,690
looking at your phone before you work 
out,

3606
02:41:42,691 --> 02:41:45,030
just fucking workout,
just get in there and get your.

3607
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:48,780
You're wasting 20 minutes doing that.
That 20 minutes you could have been done

3608
02:41:48,781 --> 02:41:52,600
20 minutes earlier and then you wouldn't
have to rush over here to do the podcast

3609
02:41:52,740 --> 02:41:53,573
and it's like,
it starts sort of giving me almost like 

3610
02:41:56,820 --> 02:42:01,120
a subconscious of renovation,
you know,

3611
02:42:01,121 --> 02:42:02,770
like just,
it's just sort of like,

3612
02:42:03,030 --> 02:42:03,863
okay,
like this is all this stuff and your 

3613
02:42:05,551 --> 02:42:06,384
subconscious is disturbing you and 
here's why it's disturbing you because 

3614
02:42:09,541 --> 02:42:11,850
you've got all this clutter,
so let's clean this shit up,

3615
02:42:12,300 --> 02:42:13,890
clean it up,
get it together.

3616
02:42:14,220 --> 02:42:15,053
And it's been responsible for,
I think a lot of my focus and 

3617
02:42:17,611 --> 02:42:18,444
discipline,
like understanding the significance of 

3618
02:42:21,270 --> 02:42:22,103
that focus and discipline and it's not 
just like to be a tough guy or the just 

3619
02:42:26,971 --> 02:42:28,080
go out there and kick ass.

3620
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:32,520
It's more like to absolve yourself of 
brain clutter.

3621
02:42:33,090 --> 02:42:34,930
That's pretty awesome.
That introspection,

3622
02:42:34,960 --> 02:42:38,190
you're talking about,
a lot of people could use more of that,

3623
02:42:38,191 --> 02:42:40,020
including myself.
I mean it's certainly,

3624
02:42:40,080 --> 02:42:40,913
I think all of us.
I think it almost really anyone 

3625
02:42:42,691 --> 02:42:43,524
listening to this,
and I think there's probably one in San 

3626
02:42:46,020 --> 02:42:48,600
Diego,
so if there's a tank place in San Diego,

3627
02:42:48,780 --> 02:42:49,613
reach out to Dr Rhonda Patrick and I'm 
sure that there's a place you could use 

3628
02:42:53,341 --> 02:42:54,540
this down there.
This near you.

3629
02:42:54,680 --> 02:42:55,513
I mean I certainly use other things like
a extra running long runs should do 

3630
02:42:58,771 --> 02:42:59,604
something similar in that zone,
but what you're describing sounds kind 

3631
02:43:03,721 --> 02:43:04,554
of like next level.
A lot of people get it from swimming as 

3632
02:43:06,271 --> 02:43:08,290
well.
Swimming because it was just like,

3633
02:43:09,480 --> 02:43:10,313
yeah,
that repetitive thing and then you're 

3634
02:43:12,700 --> 02:43:13,533
sort of managing the motion of your body
and then once you get in it's almost 

3635
02:43:16,601 --> 02:43:19,600
like a mantra.
You managing the motion of your body and

3636
02:43:19,601 --> 02:43:22,360
then the breathing and then once you get
it all sync up.

3637
02:43:22,390 --> 02:43:26,710
If you're in good enough shape that it's
not like a titanic struggle with every,

3638
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:27,993
every lap or every stroke of your arms.
You can get into the sort of meditative 

3639
02:43:31,661 --> 02:43:34,180
state that a lot of people achieve with 
running or,

3640
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:35,553
or even with.
Just like sitting there and breathing 

3641
02:43:36,671 --> 02:43:40,090
like a lot of people get that.
I have a difficult time doing that,

3642
02:43:40,091 --> 02:43:41,290
but no,
it's hard.

3643
02:43:41,630 --> 02:43:44,260
Yeah.
Is it a funny.

3644
02:43:44,510 --> 02:43:45,790
That'd be hard to sit still.

3645
02:43:46,010 --> 02:43:46,843
It is.
It is funny because actually like that 

3646
02:43:50,390 --> 02:43:52,340
some of the other interesting stuff is 
just doing that,

3647
02:43:52,341 --> 02:43:53,174
sit there,
sit still and breathe changes like the 

3648
02:43:56,540 --> 02:43:58,790
activation of enzymes and stuff like 
telomerase.

3649
02:43:58,820 --> 02:44:03,230
The enzyme that rebuilds telomeres get.
We literally activates telomerase so,

3650
02:44:03,620 --> 02:44:06,470
so fascinating.
How just like certain things like,

3651
02:44:06,500 --> 02:44:09,680
like I wouldn't imagine doing that.
Would it actually,

3652
02:44:09,681 --> 02:44:11,540
you know,
changed telomerase

3653
02:44:11,930 --> 02:44:14,360
bodies.
This is never ending puzzle.

3654
02:44:14,400 --> 02:44:15,233
It really is.
And whenever I talked to you a more and 

3655
02:44:16,941 --> 02:44:17,774
more sort of aware of that because 
there's so many different things in so 

3656
02:44:21,381 --> 02:44:22,214
many different mechanisms and in terms 
of nutrition and nutritional absorption 

3657
02:44:24,951 --> 02:44:27,290
that I just,
I'm so ignorant of and it's.

3658
02:44:27,291 --> 02:44:29,050
I hear all these things and I'm like,
I'm trying to,

3659
02:44:30,170 --> 02:44:34,610
trying to get a map of the territory and
I make also,

3660
02:44:34,611 --> 02:44:35,444
there's so many things I'm injured,
but I feel like every time I talk it's 

3661
02:44:39,081 --> 02:44:42,020
like someone's breaking out a little 
napkin and going,

3662
02:44:42,021 --> 02:44:42,854
hey,
I know you take a right here and you go 

3663
02:44:43,881 --> 02:44:45,020
there and I go,
all right,

3664
02:44:45,350 --> 02:44:46,183
but it's not a real map.
Like the map of the whole thing escapes 

3665
02:44:50,661 --> 02:44:52,220
me.
It's too big.

3666
02:44:52,330 --> 02:44:55,790
It's too big.
It's too complex and I'll listen to this

3667
02:44:55,791 --> 02:44:56,624
podcast again,
like I'll listen to all the things you 

3668
02:44:58,580 --> 02:45:01,670
said again and I'll try to take notes 
maybe tomorrow or the next day,

3669
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:05,300
but then my stupid brain will like,
it'll like leak.

3670
02:45:05,301 --> 02:45:09,080
Half of it will leak out.
It's like I'm trying to hold water in my

3671
02:45:09,081 --> 02:45:10,970
fingers.
It's like I got it.

3672
02:45:11,180 --> 02:45:14,030
I've got some water and stop fucking 
dripping down my wrists.

3673
02:45:15,200 --> 02:45:17,580
So hard,
so hard to get a,

3674
02:45:18,020 --> 02:45:19,790
a real understanding of this stuff.

3675
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:21,490
I agree.
I mean,

3676
02:45:21,510 --> 02:45:25,100
certainly lots of controversy and 
disagreement among researchers as well,

3677
02:45:25,790 --> 02:45:26,720
you know,
don't you think

3678
02:45:26,970 --> 02:45:27,803
also probably one,
what's so attractive about simplifying 

3679
02:45:30,471 --> 02:45:33,650
things like Hashtag meet heels,
you know what I mean?

3680
02:45:33,651 --> 02:45:34,700
Like people almost like,
yeah,

3681
02:45:34,701 --> 02:45:35,534
let's just jam it into a saying or jam 
it into like one type of practice and 

3682
02:45:39,651 --> 02:45:41,390
that's all you need.
That's all you need.

3683
02:45:41,730 --> 02:45:43,070
I need is meat.
Look at me.

3684
02:45:43,190 --> 02:45:44,570
I'm just eating meat.
Filling.

3685
02:45:44,571 --> 02:45:46,070
Great.
I feel amazing.

3686
02:45:46,370 --> 02:45:47,170
And then people are like,
oh,

3687
02:45:47,170 --> 02:45:49,580
I want to feel amazing.
And then they jump into.

3688
02:45:49,770 --> 02:45:50,603
Yep.

3689
02:45:55,580 --> 02:45:57,230
You already saw me get emotional.
I was,

3690
02:45:57,970 --> 02:45:58,761
yeah.
No,

3691
02:45:58,761 --> 02:45:59,594
I'm glad you did.
I'm glad you did get emotional and I'm 

3692
02:46:01,251 --> 02:46:02,084
glad you did sort of spell it out and I 
hope I'm going to send this to Jordan 

3693
02:46:06,050 --> 02:46:06,883
afterwards.
I don't know if he has the time to 

3694
02:46:07,461 --> 02:46:09,740
listen to it.
He might have less than us,

3695
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:11,420
you know,
guys pretty busy.

3696
02:46:11,660 --> 02:46:13,370
But maybe when he's,
you know,

3697
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:16,490
moving,
going from one place to another on plane

3698
02:46:16,491 --> 02:46:17,600
or whatever.
Yeah.

3699
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:18,993
Um,
I just think that it's a movement right 

3700
02:46:21,561 --> 02:46:25,490
now and you've got to be real careful 
about movements because you get swept up

3701
02:46:25,491 --> 02:46:26,870
in him and you're like,
Hey,

3702
02:46:26,871 --> 02:46:30,350
I'm moving in the right way.
I don't know if this is the right way to

3703
02:46:30,351 --> 02:46:31,290
move,
but a move.

3704
02:46:33,370 --> 02:46:35,260
Yeah.
So.

3705
02:46:35,830 --> 02:46:36,920
Alright,
well look,

3706
02:46:36,980 --> 02:46:39,240
we just did three hours.
Nice.

3707
02:46:39,530 --> 02:46:41,360
Crazy.
Time flies.

3708
02:46:41,390 --> 02:46:42,650
I always love talking with you,
Joe.

3709
02:46:42,790 --> 02:46:44,330
I always love talking with you too.
It's fun.

3710
02:46:44,360 --> 02:46:45,193
I'm going to take you up on the 
flotation thing because I really do any 

3711
02:46:46,900 --> 02:46:48,410
time,
any time.

3712
02:46:48,470 --> 02:46:49,880
Call me up.
It's yours.

3713
02:46:50,300 --> 02:46:51,133
Just give me some time.
Just give me like a little bit in 

3714
02:46:54,981 --> 02:46:56,630
advance.
We'll open the place up for you.

3715
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:58,753
Awesome.
