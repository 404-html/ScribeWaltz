1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,700
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,241
you know,

3
00:00:02,241 --> 00:00:04,730
I would be guy would try
to be nice to everybody,

4
00:00:04,731 --> 00:00:06,380
but I was already on a trigger.

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,570
So if something happened,

6
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,201
you know,

7
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:10,790
where someone did something rude,

8
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:13,640
I would over escalate almost immediately.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,430
I would be ready to take
them to fucking full on war.

10
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,680
Can I immediately,

11
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:19,300
can I tell a story which one?

12
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:19,871
Well,

13
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:20,200
I don't,

14
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,640
I don't know that we've
ever talked about this,

15
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:23,950
but we had one kind of
blowout in our life.

16
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,903
And it was you,

17
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,980
I was living with your
girlfriend at the time.

18
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:27,814
Jennifer.

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,410
Jennifer from Staten Island.

20
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,390
We their first names.

21
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:31,631
Okay.

22
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:32,130
Right.

23
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:32,620
Yes.

24
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,310
Big Hair.

25
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:33,910
Very nice growth.

26
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,743
Great check.

27
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,643
Great check.

28
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,630
I'll tell the story of how this happened.

29
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:38,910
Uh,

30
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,451
we,

31
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:39,750
uh,

32
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,590
we went to,

33
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:41,000
uh,

34
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,460
some,

35
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,240
some club.

36
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,511
Okay.

37
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,740
I don't want to say
we're where she worked,

38
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,591
but we,

39
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:44,941
we,

40
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:45,270
uh,

41
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,930
Greg and I were there and um,

42
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,980
she came over to talk to us and said
that she had a room for rent in her

43
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:55,770
apartment and she needed
to find a roommate.

44
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,791
And then,

45
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:57,030
uh,

46
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,481
I was like,

47
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,410
I think Greg needs a roommate.

48
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,510
And Greg's looking for a room.

49
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,970
I was trying to get out of my friends,

50
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:05,300
we're all drunks and I'd quit drinking
and I need to just get the fuck out.

51
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,530
And so,

52
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:07,010
uh,

53
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,990
she walks away and Greg was like,

54
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:09,741
Holy Shit,

55
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:10,820
I'm going to be living with her.

56
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:11,654
All my God.

57
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,650
Look how fun

58
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,483
can hace is.

59
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:13,821
I go,

60
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:14,061
dude,

61
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:14,841
she's fucking hot.

62
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:15,320
Right?

63
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,800
And so then a girlfriend
before you started,

64
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:19,640
before we started dating,

65
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:20,474
we just met her.

66
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,380
We had just met her.

67
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,281
So,

68
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:22,760
um,

69
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,300
then,

70
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:23,511
uh,

71
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:24,680
I called him the next day.

72
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:24,891
I go,

73
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:25,221
dude,

74
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,050
your new apartment is fucking awesome.

75
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:29,451
And he'd go,

76
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:30,231
what are you talking about?

77
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:30,650
I just,

78
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:30,871
Oh,

79
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:31,041
what?

80
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,570
Just fuck that girl
and your new apartment.

81
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:33,404
It's amazing.

82
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:35,840
Okay.

83
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,380
And you were like,

84
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:36,730
oh.

85
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,700
So we had like a little thing where we're,

86
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,450
Greg kind of liked this girl first,

87
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,433
sort of,

88
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,400
and I fucked her.

89
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:44,930
And then he was living
with her and it was,

90
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,010
it was kind of weird.

91
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:46,791
And,

92
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,240
um,

93
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,820
there was one night where she had,

94
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,540
uh,

95
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,060
told me that you were
talking shit about me.

96
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,111
And,

97
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:54,440
uh,

98
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,770
it really hurt my feelings because
I couldn't believe that you did it.

99
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,693
You,

100
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,920
she had her period and uh,

101
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:01,290
you know,

102
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,540
we were like 21 years old,

103
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,410
whatever the fuck it was.

104
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:03,720
You know,

105
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,720
you say stupid shit back then and
she was like miserable and uh,

106
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,730
she would have bad periods and you
came up to her and you confronted me,

107
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,121
go look,

108
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:15,410
if you're this miserable,

109
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,180
why don't you just fucking leave him?

110
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,630
You know,

111
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:17,781
like,

112
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:18,081
really,

113
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:18,801
what are you doing here?

114
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:19,700
This is what she told you.

115
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,563
This is what you told me.

116
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,040
And then she told you,

117
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:22,820
Greg,

118
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,690
I'm on my period.

119
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,800
That's why I'm miserable.

120
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,650
And I was so upset.

121
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:28,641
I was like,

122
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:29,061
wow,

123
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,320
I can't believe he did that.

124
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:30,771
I mean,

125
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:31,604
she was hot,

126
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,000
you know,

127
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,833
and you're living with her.

128
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,950
I get all that.

129
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,671
I get all that,

130
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:38,360
but I couldn't believe that you said
something to her like bad about me,

131
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,931
you know,

132
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:40,580
because in my eyes,

133
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:43,040
I'm a very loyal person and
when someone's my friend,

134
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,890
they're my friend and I would
never go to a friend's girl.

135
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:47,810
But it was a very complicated situation.

136
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:48,290
You know,

137
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,980
it's not healthy for a heterosexual
guy to be living with a hot girl in con

138
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,890
Ted it at a,

139
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:57,803
so anyway,

140
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,670
I go on this Gig and the Gig was terrible.

141
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,020
It's a fucking awful gig.

142
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:05,140
And it was a long drive and
I did not have a good set.

143
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,450
And I was coming back and I
was with her and you know,

144
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,800
she had just told me this thing that
you had did and that was so fucking mad.

145
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:12,760
I couldn't believe it.

146
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,260
I was so fucking Matt.

147
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,530
And we went and got ice cream and um,

148
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,000
I went to the bathroom and I came back
and I opened my ice cream and Jennifer

149
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,540
was eating hers and my ice cream
bar had a bite taken out of it,

150
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,030
Ben and Jerry's piece pop.

151
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,013
And it was,

152
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,850
Greg had taken a bite out of it.

153
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,970
And so that I've flipped a switch and
I threw the ice cream at your face and

154
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,813
about a hundred.

155
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,730
And uh,

156
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,810
I don't know what,

157
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,830
I don't know what I said.

158
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:42,730
I don't remember what I said,

159
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,900
but I remember I went into,

160
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,850
I want it to danger zone.

161
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,813
Yeah,

162
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,120
well I wanted to bring it up
cause we never talked about it.

163
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,581
We never did.

164
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:50,240
And I want to,

165
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,410
because obviously look,

166
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,280
there's always two sides if of
course three sides in this case.

167
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,960
And uh,

168
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:57,980
I think number one,

169
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:01,550
I was a brash fucking wise ass pervert,

170
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:01,941
you know,

171
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,290
with a lot of energy back then.

172
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,650
And so first point I would
say is that with Jennifer,

173
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,420
if I said I can't believe
have living with her,

174
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,380
I think it was probably more of a comic
premise than like a real attraction on

175
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:13,214
any level.

176
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,791
I think it was like,

177
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,031
yeah,

178
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:18,440
she was hot but I wouldn't be moving
in with a chick to try to get laid with

179
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:19,130
her.

180
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,390
Probably more of like,

181
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,150
yeah,

182
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:21,983
I'm not saying,

183
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,240
I think it was a residual feeling with
you that like I had said that and it was

184
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:29,000
maybe on your mind that I'm
living with her and you know,

185
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,490
that's a little bit fucking,

186
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,940
I'm pretty open minded dude.

187
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:33,020
She was living with another guy,

188
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:36,290
the gay guy and I would
go while he was gagged,

189
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,020
don't give it up.

190
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,550
Don't get the same damn it.

191
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,041
And so,

192
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,060
and the other thing is if I,

193
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:41,750
and if I,

194
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,460
it's possible I might have
said that thing about,

195
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,631
wait,

196
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:45,630
let me just say my side of it.

197
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,630
It's possible.

198
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,110
Who knows?

199
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,250
I might've said something about you,

200
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,970
you know,

201
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,600
and again,

202
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,830
I was a fucking loud mouth.

203
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:53,120
I sat and talked a lot of shit.

204
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,981
I think that,

205
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:54,210
uh,

206
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:54,951
in my heart,

207
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:56,000
you and I were good friends.

208
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:58,130
We had come up and done
a lot of shit together,

209
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:58,970
gone through a lot,

210
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:00,170
support each other a lot.

211
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,750
And I think if I'd said something a,

212
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:03,650
it's again,

213
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,760
I have no fucking idea.

214
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:05,600
I don't remember.

215
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,281
You know,

216
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,150
it's so long ago,

217
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:08,560
the memories aren't real anyway.

218
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,180
They're not,

219
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,013
but it could,

220
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,340
that's why I brought it up in this,

221
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:12,121
in this arena,

222
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:13,050
because I feel like,

223
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,430
I don't know if there's humor in it,

224
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:16,500
but I think that there's
a real moment in it where,

225
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:16,861
you know,

226
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:17,521
we were,

227
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:20,760
I think it fucked me up too,

228
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:21,630
because first of all,

229
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:24,300
seeing you get that angry was like,

230
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,810
you know,

231
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,920
scary shit.

232
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,491
And it was,

233
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:26,630
I,

234
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,800
the irony of you hitting me with
the Ben and Jerry's piece pop,

235
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,660
it was also not completely lost on me

236
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,270
and I,

237
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,210
and I felt like,

238
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:36,481
you know,

239
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:39,930
and sadly that was right at a time
when you were moving to New York.

240
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,750
He started going down and work in
danger fields and all that shit.

241
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,480
So it became kind of convenient debt.

242
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,220
We just didn't see each other as much.

243
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,970
We would fucking write together every
day we drive to gigs and then all of a

244
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:53,430
sudden this kind of
blowout happened and uh,

245
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:54,780
and you just happen to be moving.

246
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:59,240
And so we spent a few years of just
being in each other's spheres at all.

247
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,730
And then it was water under
the bridge and we started to,

248
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:02,180
you know,

249
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,590
hang out and all that stuff.

250
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:07,550
But I was wanting to talk to you about
it because I felt like whatever your

251
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,650
takeaway was from that experience,

252
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:09,981
that,

253
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:10,281
you know,

254
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:10,690
it was,

255
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:10,990
it,

256
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,530
if I did say something,

257
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,730
it wasn't from my heart and that
I think it was a loaded situation.

258
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,040
It was a loaded situation.

259
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,490
And there was a few other things that,

260
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,650
wait a minute,

261
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:24,130
if you are the things that we're
leaning into that confrontation that,

262
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,611
you know,

263
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:26,230
it wasn't anything bad that you did,

264
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:28,360
it was sort of an attitude
that you had taken with me.

265
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,290
I don't know.

266
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:29,921
It was weird.

267
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:30,490
There was a bit,

268
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,600
there was a resentment thing.

269
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,040
I'm pretty,

270
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,111
uh,

271
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:33,190
pretty sensitive to it.

272
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,590
Well thinking a lot of it had
to do with living with a girl.

273
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,000
Well I,

274
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,190
part of it too was you and I grew
in different directions as comics.

275
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:39,400
You,

276
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,780
you were going hardcore,

277
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:45,160
you were hanging out with the another
Michael and you were real Kinison guy.

278
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,490
And I was starting to move a little
bit more towards not necessarily clever

279
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,110
through a,

280
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,350
yeah.

281
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,590
Clean and clever stage.

282
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,260
And you gave me a really
hard time about it.

283
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:59,470
You could call me a pussy and you've
got to fucking be real up there.

284
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,270
And it was intimidating
because it was like,

285
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:03,580
well I'm not worried you
telling me how to do my act,

286
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,800
but you will get really dark

287
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,890
histamine cause I love you.

288
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,540
I just went,

289
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,790
didn't want to see you back off.

290
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,710
You were you when you were at your best,

291
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,700
Greg Fitzsimmons would
have these sets and uh,

292
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:14,551
you would,

293
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:14,790
uh,

294
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,400
you would have a bunch of
really well crafted jokes,

295
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:20,970
you had a bunch of good things and you
have one thing where you just went over

296
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:22,740
the fucking edge completely.

297
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,900
And the comics would be howling.

298
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:25,621
And I always knew,

299
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:25,980
I was like,

300
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,980
if he can harness that and if
he can figure out how to do,

301
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,260
I mean you have a sick
fucking sense of humor.

302
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,150
So when I would see you pull back,

303
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:35,550
like to do a Letterman said or pull
back to do like any of this stuff,

304
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,001
I'm like,

305
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:39,540
the only reason that exists is because
there's someone trying to sell Toyota

306
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,770
trucks or tie.

307
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,170
The only reason why censored TV exists.

308
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,980
So this idea that it became clean and
clever and like what is clever about

309
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:51,981
cutting out the most fun aspects of life
and homogenizing it for so that four

310
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:54,450
year olds can watch it really is that,

311
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:55,141
what's clever?

312
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,250
That's clever.

313
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,840
That's not real comedy.

314
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,180
And in my head back then I
was watching you and saying,

315
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,901
well yeah,

316
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:06,250
you're just going up there and you're
just fucking throwing shit and common

317
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:11,050
their faces and your healing and your
fucking prancing the stage in a stock and

318
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:12,580
you're fucking get your
hand over the month.

319
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,421
And I was just like,

320
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:13,661
you know,

321
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,500
he's killing it.

322
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:18,240
But like that's like I was coming out of
college as an English major and I want

323
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:18,900
it to write on,

324
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,080
I've gone into writing.

325
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,870
So to me it was just a different choice.

326
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,240
And it was one that you didn't respect.

327
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:25,811
No,

328
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:26,470
it's not that.

329
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:26,740
No,

330
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,521
you just said it.

331
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:28,354
You didn't really,

332
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,300
it's not that I didn't
respect the writing.

333
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,590
It's not that I didn't respect that.

334
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:33,341
The discipline of it.

335
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:33,761
I know it's,

336
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:34,750
it's more difficult.

337
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:35,800
It's a more difficult path.

338
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,360
It was that with you,

339
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:40,120
I always knew you had a
sick fucking sense of humor,

340
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,840
so I was like,

341
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:40,901
oh,

342
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:42,180
it's like going back to Tom O'connor.

343
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't pull,

344
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,170
don't pull away from that.

345
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:44,801
Are you crazy?

346
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:45,850
That's like what makes you unique.

347
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,040
That's what makes us Howell
in the back of the room.

348
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,250
We're not laughing cause we'd
like you and it's not funny.

349
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:54,600
It's like you would say some really
dark fucked up shit and they need bill.

350
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,600
I can never that bit.

351
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,434
Yeah,

352
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,270
but they won't use me now.

353
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:01,800
But Boston comedy won't book me
on the road because of that bit.

354
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:02,210
I know,

355
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:02,910
you know.

356
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,100
Good.

357
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,080
I think that there was a part of me that,

358
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,060
I think it in baseball terms,

359
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:10,930
you are always the guy that was the
grand slam swinger and I was the guy that

360
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:15,460
just wanted to get a lot of doubles
and singles and so in a sense I think

361
00:09:15,461 --> 00:09:15,941
everybody,

362
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:16,810
my father used to say,

363
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:19,630
everybody ends up where
they're really comfortable,

364
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,290
you know?

365
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,430
And in a sense for you,

366
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,220
like you talked about going on stage
when you didn't have the material,

367
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:26,230
but doing an hour like balls out.

368
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:27,100
I'm fucking dude.

369
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,001
That wasn't me.

370
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,710
That would've been my
worst fucking nightmare.

371
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,101
To me.

372
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:32,500
It was like I wanted to
make a living doing this.

373
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,790
I wanted to write,

374
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,080
I want it to go on Letterman.

375
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:36,630
There was like things I wanted that,

376
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:38,080
that we're in this strategy.

377
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,400
Not that I like thought about it,

378
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:40,870
but it was just naturally
where I was going.

379
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,150
Right.

380
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,740
And for you it was like you
want it to fucking explode,

381
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,071
you know,

382
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:46,450
you want it to be Kinison.

383
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,540
And that was just a
different fucking strategy,

384
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,280
different game plan than I had.

385
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,440
And I think that was a big part of it too.

386
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:55,870
That was a lot of the tension
underneath the fight that happened.

387
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,450
I,

388
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:56,681
yeah,

389
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:57,580
I really resent that.

390
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,180
I,

391
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,331
well,

392
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:58,751
I did.

393
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:03,751
I resented that I was feeling like you
were not approving of what I was doing

394
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:05,080
and you're putting pressure on me not to.

395
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,500
That's hilarious because a,

396
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:08,900
I've always felt like that it was
always the opposite with people,

397
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,280
that the people that we're dirty,

398
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:10,521
we're,

399
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:11,960
especially back then in Boston,

400
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,160
they were the ones who were pressured,

401
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,120
pressured to clean it up.

402
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,510
Yeah.

403
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,343
Oliver Keithley,

404
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,021
that's all he ever,

405
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:16,731
he used to tell me,

406
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:17,480
you got to clean it up.

407
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,171
You got to clean that up.

408
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:20,030
You said 10 fox and T in 10 minutes.

409
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,530
Yeah.

410
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,130
To clean it up.

411
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:21,440
Yeah.

412
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,250
It was always like,

413
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,760
oh like I'm taking some sort of a
shortcut by doing things and I'm actually

414
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:26,810
interested in talking about,

415
00:10:26,811 --> 00:10:28,850
so you saying that I think that uh,

416
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:30,590
that I looked down on you for,

417
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:33,560
for cleaning your act up or trying
to go the professional route.

418
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,551
It wasn't that,

419
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,570
it was never that it was that I didn't
want you to stop doing the other stuff

420
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,750
cause the darkest shit was the shit
that would make me laugh the most.

421
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:42,531
And then when you look,

422
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:43,460
I can't do that anymore.

423
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:43,671
I'm like,

424
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:44,540
you're crazy.

425
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,380
That's fucking bits.

426
00:10:45,381 --> 00:10:46,070
Awesome.

427
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,990
I know in some of the
bits I look back I can't,

428
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:50,450
I'm one of those people
I cannot watch myself.

429
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,950
I've early tapes have you all,

430
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,220
I look at these clever fucking
cute jokes I was doing okay.

431
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,790
I just remembered something he
did that was fucking brilliant.

432
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,580
This is back in the day
where there was like,

433
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,830
maybe it's somebody had
heard the jerky boys,

434
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,100
like maybe like one,

435
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,560
you know,

436
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:04,961
one,

437
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:07,210
one of their cds were out and like,

438
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:08,620
they were like really kind of funny,

439
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:10,780
recorded phone calls when
they would fuck with people.

440
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,350
Greg did one where he
called him in a car rental

441
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,140
place.

442
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,281
Hey,

443
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:18,410
you did it with this extreme,

444
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,650
extreme Boston accent for years,

445
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,270
for years after the Bingo.

446
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,410
It sounds fine.

447
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,450
The car's on fire,

448
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
the whole car.

449
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,640
You're a fucking human being.
