1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,700
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,210
I have so many memories
of just not even playing.

3
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:06,650
They're just going to Hollywood.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,180
I used to go watch bands.

5
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:09,890
I used to go watch van Halen play.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,380
I used to go just hang out,

7
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:13,214
you know,

8
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:13,860
and um,

9
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,600
that's sort of half the fun of the
rainbow is just being there and seeing all

10
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,790
the freaks and all the
cool people and all the,

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:21,421
you know,

12
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,230
the people like,

13
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,381
oh,

14
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:23,250
there's that guy,

15
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,510
there's Lemmy from Motorhead,

16
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:26,730
there's all these strange characters,

17
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,000
walkers and all these people
that had been around Hollywood

18
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,510
forever.

19
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,100
I don't really know why,

20
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:32,731
you know,

21
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:33,330
uh,

22
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,620
it's just,

23
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,310
you know,

24
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,670
it's right next to the Roxy.

25
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,231
It's just,

26
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:37,860
um,

27
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,820
it's just one of those spots.

28
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:41,490
It's one of those spots are people just
get a good vibe there or something.

29
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:41,930
You know,

30
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,860
strip is just,

31
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:46,790
the sunsets trip is just one of the
all time classic spots in Americana.

32
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,180
I mean,

33
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,310
just really is where the comedy story is.

34
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:50,540
The viper room is,

35
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,460
it's incredible.

36
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:52,440
And whiskey,

37
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,600
the history of going back to
even like days of the doors.

38
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:56,080
I mean,

39
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,913
are you,

40
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,790
you know,

41
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,450
just to know that they played
the troubadour or even,

42
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:02,284
uh,

43
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,521
you know,

44
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,210
uh,

45
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,670
early days with like Linda Ronstadt,

46
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:11,230
her backup band was like
Don Henley and Glen Fry,

47
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,220
you know,

48
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,280
that was their backup pen and they went
off and made the eagles or whatever,

49
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:15,790
you know?

50
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,300
So,

51
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:16,631
yeah,

52
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:17,141
it's,

53
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:17,880
it's nuts.

54
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,030
It's,

55
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,630
you know,

56
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,871
the,

57
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:19,710
the history,

58
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,260
it goes way beyond,

59
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:22,920
um,

60
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,370
the,

61
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,290
the 70s and the 80s,

62
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,010
it's like,

63
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,530
goes back to the 60s and,

64
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,243
you know,

65
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:29,611
I mean,

66
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:30,660
you've got the doors,

67
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,130
look at how big that bandwidth,

68
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,121
you know,

69
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:33,450
they're,

70
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,490
they're the type down like that.

71
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,560
You don't think of them
doing regular guy stuff.

72
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:41,970
Like they're there to me,

73
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:42,700
you know,

74
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:42,991
you know,

75
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,690
when you're a kid and
you think of a band and

76
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,960
you like,

77
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,350
I know they don't drive
through Mcdonald's like we do.

78
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,590
It's like they're almost alien or so that,

79
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,424
you know what I mean?

80
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,790
The mystique of that been sort
of a road by the Internet.

81
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,840
Like there was a thing the other day
were Charlie Sheen was a having a Twitter

82
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:06,390
beef with his ex wife and it was,

83
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,350
that's ridiculous.

84
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:08,184
Ridiculous.

85
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,210
But it was the,

86
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,880
that's been that,

87
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,270
that sort of thing.

88
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:13,350
It's different now.

89
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:17,100
It's like it is just used to be the one
that guy was a big star that they would

90
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:22,101
be sort of living up on a house
and the behind these crazy games,

91
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,500
he know what he doing.

92
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:24,334
You know?

93
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,550
Now you're on the Internet,

94
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:28,140
you're literally in two minutes.

95
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,740
People are watching your show a,

96
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,270
you know the show you're
playing in France,

97
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,900
they're watching it in La and you just
got done with the show like two minutes

98
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:37,230
ago.

99
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:37,411
Well,

100
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:41,940
and then they get to read your Twitter
page and see when I was getting a kid,

101
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,390
it would literally be
this much of an event.

102
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:46,710
It would last all day.

103
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:49,500
I'd go buy like Robin Trowers record,

104
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,270
go to my friends,

105
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:51,571
you know,

106
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,160
we'd set up everything,

107
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:53,461
man.

108
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:58,170
I get to speakers outside of the window
and listened to this album over and over

109
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,004
and over.

110
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,260
Now kids download 300 songs in 20 minutes
before they go to school or in their

111
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:06,670
iPod or whatever.

112
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,073
It's just not,

113
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,110
it's not as personal as it used to be.

114
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,370
You know,

115
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,750
like it's more accessible,

116
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,640
it's more accessible.

117
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:16,474
It's uh,

118
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,411
you know,

119
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:18,551
I,

120
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,680
as Randy was in Conrad,

121
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,650
the article with,

122
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:20,980
uh,

123
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,660
David Grill or whatever from,

124
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,523
um,

125
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,690
foo fighters.

126
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:24,990
Yeah.

127
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,160
If we fight around in,

128
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:30,520
in Nirvana and he makes so
much sense to me because I,

129
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,830
I went through all these
things that he's talking about,

130
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:36,610
which is playing with guys that don't
really play that good and we're jamming in

131
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:40,840
the garage and pissing off
of my parents and you know,

132
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,320
and just going through that and improving
from there and just getting better,

133
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:44,850
you know,

134
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,341
whatever.

135
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:50,050
Instead of people just thrown together
with the songs written by somebody else

136
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:50,651
and all that,

137
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,484
you know,

138
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,360
it just,

139
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,193
the,

140
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,950
some of the human element has been,

141
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,310
that's my only complaint and
it's not really a complaint,

142
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:01,144
it's just,

143
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,000
I,

144
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I just prefer that people
play music in not machines.

145
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,250
You know what I mean?

146
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,000
I know what you're saying.

147
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,271
Yeah.

148
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:10,361
Well,

149
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:13,450
there's also the experience of going
to the record store and looking at the

150
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,400
album art and take it home.

151
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,234
And I love that.

152
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,620
There's definitely something
missing in my driving 200 miles or

153
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,790
150 miles to do a photo shoot when
I'm going to be the size of an ant on,

154
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,230
on,

155
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,063
you know,

156
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,980
microchip.

157
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,540
Yeah.

158
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,373
But or whatever.

159
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,131
But you know,

160
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:29,580
I,

161
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,630
it's not really complaining.

162
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,520
My whole thing is I just want to get our
music to the people the best way I can.

163
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:36,750
And I,

164
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,340
if you know your way around the Internet,

165
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:38,910
you can,

166
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,140
you can get that done.

167
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:43,820
And we just got done up to this
big monster cruise and you know,

168
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,860
30 bands on this big ship and we went
and played on an island and you know,

169
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:49,890
it was like a,

170
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,721
it was great,

171
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:51,991
you know,

172
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,310
so I'm,

173
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,420
you know,

174
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,590
I'm not bitter or anything.

175
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:56,520
I know things are different.

176
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:59,670
It's a really difficult on major labels,

177
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,061
you know,

178
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:02,600
because we can go,

179
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,890
what are our next Elma,

180
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,270
your house and your computer.

181
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,003
You know,

182
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,500
that puts a lot of power in
the artist's hands though.

183
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:14,450
And it also puts a lot of power in
their ability to promote themselves.

184
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,040
All they need is the Internet now.

185
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,611
Exactly.

186
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:19,100
And all of those other
closed off avenue was like,

187
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:23,450
we were talking about getting on the Ed
Sullivan show was everything to a guy

188
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:24,440
like Rodney Dangerfield.

189
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,970
He couldn't get on the Ed Sullivan show.

190
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:28,490
You were fucked today for a comic,

191
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:29,324
especially,

192
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,990
boy,

193
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,100
you don't need that at all.

194
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:31,430
I mean,

195
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,920
my friends who have become
famous from the Internet,

196
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:36,470
like Joey Diaz and Ari's
fear and Duncan Trussell,

197
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,880
they've only had the internet.

198
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,350
The Internet is all they ever need it.

199
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,600
But all they had a neat,

200
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,070
all they needed was
talent and a an an avenue.

201
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,150
In my days I needed a staple gun and
the posters and sunset boulevard to get

202
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:50,420
people to come out.

203
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,280
And then they had to see
the poster sided by it.

204
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:54,540
Like,

205
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,350
hmm,

206
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,300
what comes by?

207
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:57,770
And they put it ours.

208
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,311
Oh,

209
00:05:58,311 --> 00:05:58,851
say that again.

210
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,910
It goes over,

211
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,060
there's the wars of posters.

212
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:02,950
It's still awards.

213
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:03,860
Well,

214
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,360
there's the Internet wars now.

215
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,721
You know,

216
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:05,961
there's,

217
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:07,280
there's definitely a lot of that.

218
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:10,040
There's still a lot of fucking morons
out there when it comes to that kind of

219
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:10,371
stuff.

220
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,120
But,

221
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,601
but uh,

222
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:14,930
I think it's definitely a better time
as far as putting the power in the hands

223
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:19,931
of the artists and these people that are
the normal cabal that we're controlling

224
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:21,110
the music industry.

225
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:21,470
They've,

226
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,850
they've lost a lot of their power,

227
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:23,290
right?

228
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,190
Oh yeah.

229
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:24,911
And you know,

230
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:29,530
the difference now is we don't
need millions of dollars to,

231
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,660
to record and,

232
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,970
and all that kind of promotion.

233
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,900
And that's why that they're,

234
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,380
the major labels are suffering a bit.

235
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:38,831
And yeah,

236
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:39,550
the,

237
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,690
where the power comes in is we're no,

238
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,910
no longer are we just
getting our little points,

239
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:49,660
you know,

240
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,411
when they're taking,

241
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:50,950
you know,

242
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,310
we make $1 million and
the record company gets,

243
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:54,701
you know,

244
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:57,640
900 and whatever.

245
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,751
And you know,

246
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,440
they throw our crumbs enough crumbs
to where we don't like go away.

247
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:03,250
But you know,

248
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,650
but people don't realize that
for most folks they'd done,

249
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,550
they'd have no idea.

250
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,370
Like how bad the deals were at span.

251
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,740
Hailing sale was amazingly bad.

252
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:12,031
And,

253
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,140
and they even speak
about it on the Internet.

254
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:17,920
You can go on and they're sit together
and they were actually interviewing each

255
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:20,020
other about the old days.

256
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,231
You know,

257
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,850
people think we're the
bitching rock stars,

258
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:22,330
but we are,

259
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,620
we were literally broke there.

260
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,900
They said that their checks per week,

261
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:31,090
this is during the first album
where $88 and 83 cents or something.

262
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,361
Yeah.

263
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:33,440
And they were selling millions of albums.

264
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,721
Okay,

265
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,770
here's the funny part.

266
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,220
Um,

267
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,040
they got off this tour and,

268
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,370
and the record company
says you owe is $2 million.

269
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:42,761
And he goes,

270
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:43,121
okay,

271
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,140
let me get this straight.

272
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,210
So if we do 10 tours and
sell 20 million records,

273
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,150
we're going to owe you $20 million.

274
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,303
That's insane.

275
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,910
It's just from all the loans and that,

276
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:57,221
you know,

277
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:58,600
the first coming out of the gate.

278
00:07:58,601 --> 00:07:59,434
But um,

279
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,280
well it's also just a corrupt
system that has too much power.

280
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,121
It's corrupt.

281
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:09,010
And you know that being the artist when
you don't have your own representation

282
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:09,271
and,

283
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:10,390
and you know,

284
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:14,250
you just want to do anything to
break out of this club scene.

285
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:14,531
You know,

286
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:18,460
you want to be a big ban
on big tours and so you,

287
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,840
they take bad deals.

288
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:20,171
You know,

289
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:20,570
a lot of,

290
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,670
a lot of bands have done that.

291
00:08:21,671 --> 00:08:21,941
You know,

292
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:24,880
they've done successful
with their album sales,

293
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:27,310
but their business side
of is really horrid.

294
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,180
Yeah.

295
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,601
Yeah.

296
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:32,530
That's also the difference between
a business person and an artist.

297
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,890
Like a lot of artists are impulsive and
they're just not that good at things

298
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:36,401
like that.

299
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:37,540
They're not that good at business.

300
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,410
And I'm one of them,

301
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:39,600
you know,

302
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,580
our deal wasn't great either and uh,

303
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,460
but we've kind of made up for that.

304
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:46,350
We was in our whole career,

305
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,060
but at the beginning it wasn't that great,

306
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:48,460
but

307
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:48,641
well,

308
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:49,090
it sounded,

309
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,871
it always starts off.

310
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:50,471
Nobody ever says,

311
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:50,591
oh,

312
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:52,420
we've got an awesome deal
right out of that gate.

313
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:55,750
And we're very fortunate to have
an ethical record right now,

314
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,200
which is you talking about the
fucking scoundrels that signed you,

315
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:58,501
right?

316
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:58,771
I mean,

317
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,604
that's also,

318
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,200
you think about a music company.

319
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,730
How many people did they sign?

320
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:02,971
I mean they,

321
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:03,151
I mean,

322
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:05,790
they might sign 101 of them
might become great white.

323
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,500
You know,

324
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:06,850
there's,

325
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,290
there's a lot of failure involved on their
end to prognostication doesn't always

326
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,090
come down.

327
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,620
That's what they call their write offs.

328
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,310
You know,

329
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,061
the write up dance,

330
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:15,894
but yeah.

331
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,321
Yeah.

332
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:18,270
But for a band that successful,

333
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:18,990
the,

334
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,381
the,

335
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,490
the reality behind it.

336
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:22,830
Did you ever read that piece
that Courtney love wrote on the,

337
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:23,280
um,

338
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,330
the music business?

339
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,010
She wrote a pretty incredible piece about
explaining the expenses and how much

340
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:33,030
it actually costs and what an artist
actually gets paid and how much the studio

341
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:33,600
gets paid.

342
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:33,780
Right.

343
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,530
And how they go about saying
how much things are worth

344
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,991
then read the piece.

345
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:42,020
But I'm glad she wrote something
like that because it was school,

346
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,610
the audience and you know,

347
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,081
yeah,

348
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:44,490
it's pretty,

349
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,560
that's not their business.

350
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,180
Pretty incredible stuff getting,

351
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,571
yeah.

352
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:47,691
Well,

353
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:48,560
there's a little bit of that,

354
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:51,330
but it's also some of their business

355
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,450
people will understand that,

356
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,111
you know,

357
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:56,450
we work really hard and we're
not just walking around,

358
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:56,861
you know,

359
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:58,800
a Zillion zillionaires are we good

360
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,570
bummed out when the whole Napster
thing came along and people started

361
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:05,590
downloading MP three s and it just almost
immediately sort of took the wind out

362
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,270
of the sails of a records.

363
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,043
MMM.

364
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:09,870
You know,

365
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,360
I was bummed out even
before that a little bit.

366
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,300
But you know,

367
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,151
I know me,

368
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:20,830
like I were talking about earlier that
I'm a fan of music and I like to support

369
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:21,350
the artist.

370
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,660
I go out and buy their albums.

371
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:23,041
You know,

372
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:23,500
I,

373
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,820
I want the artwork,

374
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,440
I want to know who wrote the songs.

375
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:29,320
I wanted to know where
they recorded this album.

376
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:29,471
I,

377
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:30,230
you know,

378
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,020
I just think that's part of it.

379
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,700
And it's what makes the world go round
in music is to support the artists.

380
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:40,300
So I go out and buy a
Zz top CD and you know,

381
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,340
when somebody comes up and go,

382
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,791
hey man,

383
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:43,960
I just got you to a new album.

384
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:45,400
I copied it from my friend.

385
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:46,234
It's like,

386
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,261
well thanks.

387
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:47,561
You know,

388
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:51,130
at least he's going to maybe give me
some feedback and if he likes it or not,

389
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,070
or hopefully he'll go see alive,

390
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,680
you know,

391
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,820
go see a live or whatever.

392
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,690
But yeah.

393
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,523
Um,

394
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,783
I dunno man.

395
00:10:59,170 --> 00:10:59,780
Yeah,

396
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,613
it is what,

397
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,790
I'm not going to say that
that for it is what it is,

398
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,250
but it is what it is.

399
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,550
I mean,

400
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,420
we were changing.

401
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,980
The world is changing around us.

402
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:10,100
Technology is forcing us to
change and we have to adapt.

403
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,350
But the most important thing
is you're still creating,

404
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,520
you're still doing what you love.

405
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:14,354
You're still doing what he's doing.

406
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,440
And then the commerce aspect of it has
to morph and as to morph to accommodate

407
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:20,150
this new environment that we live in.

408
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,730
But the environment is so
beneficial in so many other ways.

409
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:23,420
It's just,

410
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,530
it just is what it is.

411
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:24,801
Yeah.

412
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:25,880
It has to change.

413
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,830
There's no way you're not going to have
the world change when something like the

414
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:31,670
Internet comes along.

415
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,140
So all these other way,

416
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,220
but the,

417
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,020
I think the benefits way outweigh
the negatives and am I right?

418
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,390
Yeah,

419
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,200
definitely.

420
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,700
And our fans are loyal to,

421
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,200
I mean we go over to,

422
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,440
you know,

423
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,110
Sweden or you know,

424
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:45,890
uh,

425
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,220
Switzerland or whatever and they're
all there in front of the stage,

426
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:49,581
you know,

427
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:50,414
so,

428
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,071
so we,

429
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:52,460
we are blessed in that way.

430
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,110
I mean,

431
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,441
you know,

432
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:55,210
no matter what happens in the industry,

433
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:56,810
our fans have always hung,

434
00:11:56,811 --> 00:11:57,100
you know,

435
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,850
so it's like,

436
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,683
you know,

437
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,670
well that's cause you guys appreciate it.

438
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:00,810
No,

439
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,230
but I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.

440
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:05,170
We are grateful for our fans
and I always tell them that.

441
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,640
And you know,

442
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,503
in the,

443
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,330
in the days when we were playing arenas,

444
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:11,620
every night is very difficult.

445
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:11,861
You know,

446
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,380
that the constructed meet and greets,

447
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:17,650
we can only meet a few and you
really can't go out and say,

448
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:17,861
hey,

449
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:18,101
you know,

450
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:21,670
invite 20,000 people backstage
j to put for the party.

451
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,773
You know.

452
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,540
But we've really taken advantage of,

453
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,550
of being able to hear their stories.

454
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:27,821
Man.

455
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:28,180
I mean,

456
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,600
I'm talking like stories
that I don't remember.

457
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:32,051
I mean,

458
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:32,770
you know,

459
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,130
people doing my laundry
and it gave me a ride here,

460
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,480
or you know,

461
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:39,250
they were in this certain place,

462
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,260
or this guy got married to this song,

463
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,370
or you know,

464
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,270
uh,

465
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,100
I got laid because you know,

466
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:46,030
that your song,

467
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:46,481
this one,

468
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:46,711
or,

469
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:47,544
you know what I mean?

470
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,910
It's just the stories are endless.

471
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:49,041
And,

472
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,990
and how you personally
effected these features?

473
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,843
Yeah.

474
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,310
If our music is involved with
people's life on like that,

475
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,810
because I have,

476
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,471
again,

477
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:01,960
I can relay it because
like I was saying earlier,

478
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:05,230
I literally have visuals
when I hear certain songs,

479
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:05,501
you know,

480
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,390
like I remember where I was,

481
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,740
how old I was,

482
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:09,880
what I was doing.

483
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,500
You,

484
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,111
you know,

485
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:14,980
almost like the smell that
was in the air practically,

486
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:15,814
you know?

487
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,930
And so when people come up and have
a similar story about music that,

488
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,570
that my band was involved in,

489
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:23,404
it's like,

490
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,020
you have to feel like that's a pretty,

491
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,800
uh,

492
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,760
tall compliment,

493
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,623
you know,

494
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,870
to,

495
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,221
you know,

496
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,450
just being involved with that.

497
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:41,720
Okay.
