1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,511
And crazy.

2
00:00:00,511 --> 00:00:01,344
You don't want to be here.

3
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,240
You want to be in the mountains in
Montana now you taught him in Colorado

4
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:06,591
anymore.

5
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:09,870
It's too many fucking momos
and got no fucking money.

6
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:13,320
Came into fake fucking money and
bought the hillbillies out the real

7
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,750
motherfuckers that you
needed it in case shit.

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,120
Gotta go like Woody Creek
to find those people.

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,530
You got to know Woody Creek.

10
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:20,770
Is that still fucking ham?

11
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,330
It's just once you're
fucking booze is up there,

12
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,170
you can really,

13
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,003
you got to go deep,

14
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,420
deep in the mountains of
Gunnison and shit like that.

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,290
You find those cracks.

16
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,330
Gunnison,

17
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:30,571
Brian,

18
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:31,710
you got your volume on.

19
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,670
We're echoing Gudnason
Gudnason where's that?

20
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,840
That's down south.

21
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,270
What do you think about all that
shit about the Denver airport?

22
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:42,480
Do you know anything about the conspiracy
behind the Denver airport is the

23
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,201
Denver airport.

24
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:43,651
First of all,

25
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:46,680
they moved way more dirt than
needed to and so there's this,

26
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:50,190
all this thought that there's some sort
of subterranean tunnel tunnel system and

27
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:51,660
it's all based on the end of the world.

28
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,430
Like shelters.

29
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,241
They fucked up.

30
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:55,780
Stapled to that point was a brilliant,

31
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,910
what it was like Burbank,

32
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,360
you could smuggle a fucking
dead fucking key coconut.

33
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,194
Nobody said nothing.

34
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,780
And all of a sudden they
came up with a bright idea.

35
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,920
Let's fucking make an airport
90 miles farther out by Kansas.

36
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,120
So when it snows,

37
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:10,560
we really get fucking buried.

38
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,000
We have no protection.

39
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,470
That's a bunch of cowboys,

40
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:13,681
Bro.

41
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:14,490
Making decisions.

42
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,570
And then trust me,

43
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:16,410
they're too stupid to,

44
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,040
even though the conspiracy
theory is they had an array,

45
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,970
but the people that built it may be,

46
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:23,190
but if the government was
really truly behind it,

47
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:24,810
like all these people think what it is,

48
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:26,730
is that they made an airport there.

49
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,350
But in constructing the airport,

50
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:33,030
they also built some sort of underground
safeguard oh three strongest stance.

51
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:34,350
So there's gotta be some Kinky Shit.

52
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,041
Well,

53
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:35,341
you know,

54
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:35,941
if it's close,

55
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:36,840
I mean that would be a move,

56
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:37,140
right?

57
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,600
No hills in the airport and
then build some shelters.

58
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:39,781
I mean,

59
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:41,730
that airport is bike fucking Kansas.

60
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:43,990
When you go on to the
Kansas during dick out,

61
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,911
that's what they call it.

62
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:45,600
The hip was,

63
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,231
it was easy,

64
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:46,411
man.

65
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:47,880
When I lived in Denver or in boulder,

66
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:48,090
rather,

67
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,080
it was easy to drive there.

68
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,130
How far was the drive?

69
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,090
Fucking hour.

70
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,481
Nothing.

71
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:52,291
Never any traffic.

72
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,370
It'd be 25 minutes.

73
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,211
Here's the deal though,

74
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:54,780
bro.

75
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,320
There's no traffic out that don't matter.

76
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:59,640
It used to be 25 minutes with
no traffic on fucking tones.

77
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:00,960
Crack the window a little bit.

78
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,180
They built this monster to spend money.

79
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,660
Yeah.

80
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,580
They built this bond,

81
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,260
this monster to to,

82
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,781
to just,

83
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:07,051
you know,

84
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:09,360
like when I went to fucking
Newark to see the fight with you,

85
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:09,961
Dave,

86
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:10,680
we did Newark.

87
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,180
They built a soccer stadium and soccer
stadium in Newark that spending money

88
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:16,014
left and right,

89
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,750
but they still can't put in
a left hand turning signal.

90
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,920
So if you've got to make a left 29
fucking miles and people got a male,

91
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:26,310
they're trying to keep up their reputation
as the car Jack Capitol of the world.

92
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,130
And if felt like some left turn signals,

93
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:30,870
you've got some outlet people can escape,

94
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,090
can escape the drama.

95
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:33,901
Fucking amazed.

96
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:34,950
That's the thing about that.

97
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:35,580
It's like,

98
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:35,850
you know,

99
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,660
they think that's a,

100
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,850
there's something really going
on inside that Denver airport.

101
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:40,140
There's all these documentaries,

102
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:40,740
um,

103
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,640
dedicated to it.

104
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,410
And one of the reasons for it is because,

105
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:44,070
um,

106
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,641
there's a,

107
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:48,450
these crazy murals that they're painted
up in the Denver airport and they're

108
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,980
really disturbing man.

109
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,330
Their apocalyptic,

110
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,370
like one guy's got a fucking gas mask
on with a giant sword and there's like

111
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:59,890
pictures of children and coffins
and there's fire in the background.

112
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,010
Have you

113
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,730
ever seen that shit?

114
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:00,941
Yeah,

115
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:01,511
but yeah,

116
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:03,210
we've actually talked about
it on this podcast before we,

117
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,880
yeah.

118
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,010
But do you think that
has anything to do with,

119
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,440
with that thinking you
putting the two together?

120
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,970
I don't think that it does,

121
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:10,631
definitely,

122
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:11,920
but it's interesting,

123
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,401
you know,

124
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:12,611
I mean,

125
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,020
I don't have opinion one way or another.

126
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:18,730
I've listened to the people talk about
how it's some great escape base and that

127
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,140
2012 there's going to be,

128
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:20,621
you know,

129
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:23,890
fucking asteroid's gonna
hit that they're tracking,

130
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:26,050
it's going to kill everybody except
the people that are in this underground

131
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:26,884
bunker.

132
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,341
I don't know,

133
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:27,730
man.

134
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,290
I watched a TV show on those dudes,

135
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,550
those dudes that have,

136
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:30,910
uh,

137
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,240
they've,

138
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,920
they've bought like fucking condos out
in these shelters out in like death

139
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,754
valley and Shit.

140
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,970
Have you seen those people have space
in death valley and so they have like a

141
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,670
condo inside this
underground bunker thing.

142
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,560
It's out in the middle of fucking nowhere.

143
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,670
You have to drive.

144
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,130
And he'd go out there
and they had these shows,

145
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,510
I forgot who was the host of the show,

146
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,100
but they,

147
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,080
they took you on a tour of these
fucking but might've been Jesse Ventura.

148
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,410
No,

149
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,090
it wasn't him because
they had a sense of humor.

150
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:55,990
But the,

151
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,400
whoever it was was like really?

152
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:57,950
And they,

153
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,870
they take it in his fucking tour of these
underground bunkers that they have set

154
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:04,420
up where they can survive
a fucking nuclear bomb.

155
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:04,961
I mean,

156
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,840
these guys are like half a
mile deep in the fucking earth.

157
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,130
So you survived the bump.

158
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:12,640
Now what shoe and eight fucking Momo
Vena assholes looking at each other.

159
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:13,070
Listen,

160
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,330
just live your fucking life.

161
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,960
These people at big into that shit
and just live your fucking life.

162
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,220
And we get hit by a bomb.

163
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:22,810
The best thing you could do is move on
to the fucking next life and pray to God.

164
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:24,590
It'll be fucking better doors.

165
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,453
Music.

166
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,100
What the fuck is wrong with me?

167
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,920
I'm going to live in a fucking
imagine being live in your life.

168
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:30,581
Consumer.

169
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:31,061
What happened?

170
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,090
One's a bomb drops after
[inaudible] 60 those people,

171
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:37,930
that shit wore off in the 60s they all
moved into buildings but underground

172
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:40,300
drops with little fucking sandwiches.

173
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,140
That's how Tang was
fucking and ventilating.

174
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,300
Then bent the Tang for.

175
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,740
So when we go in that fucking total
of doom and went after the Russians,

176
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:47,860
fuck everybody in the ass.

177
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,890
We come out and where we've got
vitamin C from the fucking tank,

178
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,460
not a tank was in basketball,

179
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,493
but guess what?

180
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,210
Our is aren't the Russians anymore.

181
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,280
It's a lot bigger than that and
whenever it's going to hit now,

182
00:04:57,281 --> 00:05:00,340
right now there's a thing going on in
Japan where we don't fucking know they

183
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,230
align until the people
just like everything else.

184
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,060
They're lying a 20 mile radius.

185
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,170
That shit's horrible.

186
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,670
That shit is horrible.

187
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:09,880
Radiation is fucking horrible and the
best is all these people are raising their

188
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,510
hands up.

189
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,950
We have radiation in key west.

190
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:13,450
Don't blame it on fucking Japan.

191
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,090
Don't blame it on Japan now.

192
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,450
That's not your pants for you guys.

193
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,650
Vet Radiation on your own.

194
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,320
You're greasing motherfuckers down
there off the coast of Florida.

195
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,010
You filthy cock suckers.

196
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,090
You going to blame on
the full fucking Japs.

197
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,090
They're walking around with
fucking masking as radiation.

198
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,100
West Florida that's primarily hooked up
horse riding guys off and creating heat

199
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,160
burning that they put in the
fucking beach during CSI Miami.

200
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:39,010
They see all these chicks Brazilian
jumping up and down with that ass.

201
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,380
That's what that fucking is.

202
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,570
Pussy Buck,

203
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,730
a nasty radiation,

204
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:45,580
but it's something extra dirty of
a point that you get from Miami.

205
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:48,220
You ever watched porn from Miami
because it's almost like they're like a

206
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:49,480
retarded people fucking,

207
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,380
you know what I mean?

208
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,500
And they're oiled up,

209
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,390
oil dropping and just something
about it like you can't relate.

210
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:57,200
It's hard to even jerk off
trouble with Joe Rogan.

211
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,700
None of mine.

212
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,970
The martians and lift going
up in fucking trouble.

213
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,080
This thing in Japan is a lot
worse than what they're saying.

214
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:03,740
You think so?

215
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,340
Fuck yeah.

216
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,173
What makes you say this?

217
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,850
I just know our society and
they don't want to scare us,

218
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,120
which was fucking Japanese started coming
out with six flock and eyes and shit.

219
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,290
You don't know which
one is looking at you.

220
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,110
Then they're going to say one
better so he could see better.

221
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:15,741
Maybe,

222
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:16,220
you know,

223
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,720
maybe that's 2012 they,

224
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:19,190
that'll be the next mutation.

225
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,200
Good Dab action to radiation.

226
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,093
This is not fun.

227
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,680
Any animals besides roaches that
are really good with radiation?

228
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,530
Roaches is supposed to be the best at it,

229
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:27,020
right?

230
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,853
Yeah,

231
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,581
slip the right thing.

232
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,050
But is that,

233
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:29,883
is that even,

234
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,020
is that even just like a wives' tale?

235
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:32,710
I don't know.

236
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,360
Someone should do us a favor and now
we know that the Japan is fuck sandbox

237
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,080
cockroaches over there
with a Webcam on it.

238
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,663
Let's see what's up.

239
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,770
If you love America,

240
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:42,320
I go over there

241
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,900
you that stupid fucking water,

242
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:46,840
all that soil and I don't know what
the fuck's going on and you know what?

243
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:48,340
Now besides that,

244
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,930
we're all spread out live view.

245
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,070
Where in this fucking place,

246
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,933
what the fuck

247
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:53,621
are you?

248
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,454
Fucking crazy.

249
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,100
These guys are just sitting there waiting.

250
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,441
It's like,

251
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:56,710
uh,

252
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,161
it's like,

253
00:06:57,161 --> 00:06:57,580
uh,

254
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,610
you're just waiting for us to wear
out before you fuck us in their home.

255
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,430
But what's that guy would've
been looking for for 11 years?

256
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,110
He's just sitting there going all,

257
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:05,930
we got them now.

258
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,090
This went out like motherfuckers
would just light a fire in Kansas,

259
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,260
CNN,

260
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,160
breaking news.

261
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:14,560
I get CNN breaking news sent to my phone.

262
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,750
Holla US intelligence source.

263
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,780
CIA is operating inside Libya to help
us increase military and political

264
00:07:23,171 --> 00:07:26,200
understanding what that means.

265
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:30,070
Somebody is about to get jet bitch whore.

266
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,170
Shit quote is that,

267
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:32,800
oh,

268
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,800
this CIA is there to increase the
military and political understanding.

269
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,011
No,

270
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:40,450
this is what we want you to do.

271
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:41,284
Do you understand?

272
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,621
Okay,

273
00:07:41,621 --> 00:07:42,790
here's the political understanding.

274
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,470
We got the bombs bitch.

275
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:44,771
Okay,

276
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:48,310
we got fucking robots that
we can operate from Nevada.

277
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:48,731
Okay?

278
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:51,790
And you don't even see them because they
blend in with the sky and they don't

279
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,240
make any noise because they're fucking
solar powered and they can can contain

280
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,860
hell fire missiles.

281
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,783
Hell fire.

282
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,930
That's what I decided to name him.

283
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,351
Not,

284
00:07:59,351 --> 00:07:59,681
you know,

285
00:07:59,681 --> 00:07:59,851
the,

286
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:00,071
the,

287
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:02,530
the beautiful flower missile or you know,

288
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,990
Lick my ass hole missile,

289
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:04,380
no.

290
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,720
Hell Fire Hellfire missiles and they're
shooting them from another fucking part

291
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:08,554
of the world.

292
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,360
Imagine a lag they have.

293
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,940
They must have to real like
plan a shot in advance.

294
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,490
Like it just like playing
quake online when you got lag.

295
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:18,820
If you have like a 56 k connection and
there's some asshole you're planning has

296
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,380
got a cable modem and you know,

297
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:24,040
he gets to move quicker than you because
his downtime is pink time between

298
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,930
connecting to the server
and back as much quicker.

299
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,913
So you're a fuck.

300
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,720
These guys must have like super lag.

301
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,060
1985 we went to see ran both to when
that motherfucker took an hour out,

302
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:36,030
when the explosive at the end
and when he shot at all of his,

303
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:36,840
lost our money.

304
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,010
Nobody liked the black people.

305
00:08:38,011 --> 00:08:39,830
Black people love our
rules and explosives it.

306
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,360
I seen that movie that has 78th street.

307
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:45,450
I never seen black
people crazy in my life.

308
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:47,910
When Rambo came out of the mud
on his eyes opened up and choked.

309
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:50,370
Her mother thought black
people went bananas.

310
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,270
They're like yelling.

311
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,260
We should've thought of that,

312
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,280
but what is it about black
dudes that love martial arts?

313
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,731
Love it.

314
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:59,070
They love anything special.

315
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,080
I got dude doing some crazy shit like,

316
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,530
oh,

317
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,360
that motherfucker got a gun in the shoe.

318
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:05,210
Check that shit out
because something about it.

319
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,950
Dude pulls his shoe off and
guns down the bad guy like,

320
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,761
oh shit.

321
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:08,941
No,

322
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,774
he didn't.

323
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:10,980
What does that,

324
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,813
what does it mean?

325
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,900
They're just very vocal.

326
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:13,734
They're excited.

327
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,950
Thing about this was,

328
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,570
that was 20 years ago.

329
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,960
The shit we got now as bombs
and stuff is off the charts.

330
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,960
We got a bond that comes at you as a car
that follows you to the gas station pro

331
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,490
or you're pumping gas.

332
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:30,660
It turns into Obama.

333
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:31,381
Guy Pops on,

334
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,030
taps you on the shoulder and says goodbye.

335
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,920
That's the shit we got.

336
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,630
We got shit that comes to your house.

337
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:37,500
Just looked like a cake.

338
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:39,840
Happy Birthday and when you're
going to block the candles,

339
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,070
it's just fucking blows up.

340
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,210
We got some shit now.

341
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,871
You know what?

342
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:43,910
I saw that it was really crazy.

343
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,090
They got this rover,

344
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:45,751
this a,

345
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:50,400
this a remote controlled drone rover
that's moving around that can jump in the

346
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:51,234
air.

347
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,870
It gets up to a fence and I think you
can go like eight or nine feet in the

348
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:59,760
fucking air and it moves up to the fence
and then it just goes and flies to the

349
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,090
end.

350
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,600
Landsdale the side and it looks like
basically it's like like some sort of a

351
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,980
flat box,

352
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,970
you know where all the electronics is
with like two tractor to rubber tractor

353
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:10,200
things on the side of it I guess.

354
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,330
And the fucking thing
flies through the air.

355
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,110
I mean,

356
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,943
what's,

357
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,420
what's next?

358
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,231
You know,

359
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:18,180
that's the other thing that
people are thinking about.

360
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,280
A lot of the shit that's
going down in Afghanistan.

361
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,670
A lot of the shit that's going down in
the Middle East period and said the CIA

362
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,560
has got all kinds of shit going on.

363
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:28,620
All kinds of little tiny
little drones and explosives.

364
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,670
It blowing up in convenient
spots of spark action.

365
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,101
You know,

366
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:33,701
that's what they'd do.

367
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:33,851
They,

368
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:35,830
that's what they do is bark war and get,

369
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,310
you know,

370
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,143
they've always done that.

371
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,380
But the bottom line of this,

372
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:38,680
what do you,

373
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,900
what do you think is really going on?

374
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,680
They figured out some Libyan doctor
figuring out a way how to grow 50 kilos of

375
00:10:44,681 --> 00:10:47,050
heroin in your bath tub
in the United States.

376
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:48,040
Find out and that Jack,

377
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,680
that motherfucker Kadafi,

378
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,170
he's got an army of motherfuckers around
this guy with missiles and explosives,

379
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:54,450
but the United States is Jacqueline.

380
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,750
This guy's got something to do with age.

381
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,810
It's got something to do with fucking
why we're over there in the fucking first

382
00:10:58,811 --> 00:10:59,380
place.

383
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,000
The whole nucleus of this thing.

384
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,520
People are dying in Detroit from heroin.

385
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,500
It was fucking war and we're still,

386
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:07,900
now we're going to take
over Libya boxes or money,

387
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:08,870
Bro.

388
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,100
Isn't it amazing how many people would
think you're crazy when you start talking

389
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:14,080
about the fact they're in
Afghanistan for heroin,

390
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:14,980
people going to,

391
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,900
what are you talking about?

392
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,370
They'll look at you like you just
fucking just ate a bowl of shit.

393
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:21,850
They'll looky,

394
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,110
looky.

395
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,330
Oh,

396
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:22,740
you're ready?

397
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,180
[inaudible] person who,

398
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:24,511
yeah,

399
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:26,370
we're at war for heroin.

400
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,590
Where do you think that money's going,

401
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:29,424
man?

402
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:30,710
What?

403
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,250
Do you know how much money
you were talking about?

404
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,270
They can ignore that.

405
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:34,104
You're fucking crazy.

406
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,740
We want to take over a country
so we get a better gyros.

407
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:40,700
That's what you tell him that we've
taken over a consciously because I don't

408
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,050
know what that fucking loot dog,

409
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,640
that's the bottom line.

410
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,961
Bottom line.

411
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:46,310
There's all sorts of lewd over there.

412
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,430
Yeah,

413
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,460
and this is all sorts of Luton.

414
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:48,061
Libya too.

415
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:48,481
I mean it's,

416
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:49,020
it's,

417
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:54,020
is it a fucking coincidence
that for whatever reason
we decide to attack instead

418
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:58,660
of going to Mexico and straighten out
that bullshit that's right next door.

419
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,680
But on Mexico's guns,

420
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:00,514
Burritos,

421
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,370
burritos and hookers
and donkeys and Tequila,

422
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,810
because there's not a
lot of shit to offer.

423
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,010
Mexicans got ready though.

424
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,430
Getting,

425
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:06,910
but listen,

426
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,830
that's some crazy
motherfuckers don't end well.

427
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,340
They gotta.

428
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,570
They gotta clean up their problem.

429
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,640
They've got a big problem and
it's because of the United States.

430
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:13,474
It's a big part of it.

431
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,040
They wanted to make everything legal.

432
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,760
They wanted to,

433
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,650
you know they did.

434
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,231
Do you know that?

435
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:17,511
They you,

436
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:19,150
here's a little known fact.

437
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,280
Mexico has decriminalized everything,

438
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,391
small amounts.

439
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:23,224
When you're not selling it,

440
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,011
everything's legal.

441
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:24,191
Now.

442
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,840
You could get acid in Mexico,

443
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,340
you can get mushrooms in Mexico.

444
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,880
They did decriminalize everything just
because they had to allocate resources to

445
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,290
fight in these fucking drug lords.

446
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,340
I mean that's a,

447
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,300
that's a gone country.

448
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,021
That country is gone.

449
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,340
The country doesn't have
a government anymore.

450
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:37,180
That's right next door,

451
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,930
right next door.

452
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,441
Right next door.

453
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:39,250
Right next door.

454
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,410
The fucking drug army is,

455
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:44,020
it's like going to war with
someone who lives in your country.

456
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,470
It's like if we were fighting al Qaeda,

457
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:49,420
but al Qaeda had billions of dollars
and it was way more armed and they were

458
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:50,254
living here.

459
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,123
That's what it's like.

460
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,530
That's what it's like being
a fucking comes in Mexico.

461
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,610
Here's the crazy thing.

462
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:55,900
Mexico is coming back to get,

463
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:56,830
what's this bitch,

464
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,730
California and Texas rock though.

465
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,030
You can't take Texas.

466
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,350
You can't take care of even the Mexicans
will the go around Texas and Jack

467
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,760
Wyoming though Jack Dallas,

468
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:07,241
Dallas,

469
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:07,450
uh,

470
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,530
tie our candidate shit.

471
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:09,310
They'll give them a beat.

472
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:09,941
Nah,

473
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:12,330
you can to the outskirts of Texas.

474
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:14,410
They'll come out of their hunting
blinds and kill you is all,

475
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,460
I don't have a chance here.

476
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,351
He lives there.

477
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:18,730
Ted Nugent lives in Waco now.

478
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:18,911
Yeah.

479
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:19,840
You can't fuck with text.

480
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,800
He does.

481
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,120
He's got a high fence.

482
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:24,190
I've always admired what
I think he's a retard,

483
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,310
but I think he does a lot of
things that I really agree with.

484
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:29,650
And one of the things that I agree
with is when he lived in Michigan,

485
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,030
he had this bad ass compound.

486
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:35,110
We let 2000 acres or something like that
and it was all fenced in and he had all

487
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:39,640
these animals living inside his compound
and he would just go and Jack Him and

488
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:40,930
that's where he got all this food from.

489
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,230
He got all his food from hunting
on his own property and I'm like,

490
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:44,801
God damn it.

491
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:45,700
That's fucking brilliant.

492
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,570
That's how I want to live.

493
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:47,620
I would love to live like that.

494
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:48,580
Just eat what you hunt.

495
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,510
Yeah.

496
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,910
That's one of the reasons why
I was into moving to Colorado.

497
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,960
One of the reasons why I was up there,

498
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:53,410
I was like,

499
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:53,591
look,

500
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:54,430
if the shit hits the fan,

501
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,570
you're living in the woods.

502
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:57,790
You know there's a lot of animals
out here in the spring water,

503
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,430
the compaction,

504
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,000
fucking shooting a pig.

505
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,840
It in a fucking cave.

506
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,580
What your kids have cave.

507
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,080
Oof.

508
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,930
Just given him all fucking civil way and
living in a tent with fucking eaters.

509
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,570
If this shit ever went down and got Kinky,

510
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:11,920
can you imagine that Kinky,

511
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:17,200
kinky shit gets kinky
dog and the fuck this.

512
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,120
So I'm excited about Oregon.

513
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:20,020
Oregon's one of those,

514
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:21,290
so we're going to have
a good fucking time.

515
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,920
Oregon's one of those states
has been under grid for years,

516
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:24,271
but no,

517
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:24,940
getting a little bud.

518
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,930
They kept it hush hush.

519
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,190
I used to get some good,

520
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:29,080
we'd love to get 15 fucking years ago.

521
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,950
It's bass,

522
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,783
Ashlyn,

523
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,900
Eugene Bend,

524
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,450
Oregon's a Hippie flubbing
foundation over there and,

525
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,250
but Portland's a pretty hippie place too,

526
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,710
isn't very hippy now he's up
to at girls have dirty feet.

527
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,760
They have dirty feet.

528
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,250
Make them put socks on,

529
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,640
fuck socks and say sign and
dump breathing my mouth.

530
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,710
Portland was the place that I went to
last year and we were at trying to find

531
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:53,690
the most person in a Costco
for like a half hour meeting.

532
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,310
The girl is with Amy cannot,

533
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,000
who'd you fuck?

534
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,181
Yeah.

535
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:57,260
And we couldn't find anyone.

536
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:58,940
So Costco though,

537
00:14:58,941 --> 00:14:59,241
dude,

538
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:01,910
go to a Costco in Burbank and even
with a bunch of cripples there too.

539
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,211
I know,

540
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:05,600
but that's a pack Dasko I
usually watch time one string.

541
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,310
You need to go to better places.

542
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,710
So it was a smaller amount.

543
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,280
Smaller amount of people
you'd want to fuck.

544
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,210
That's okay dude.

545
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,233
You're going to go,

546
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,333
I'll be okay.

547
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,190
Got to live somewhere with this.

548
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,400
If this place falls apart.

549
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,380
I went to this too many humans here.

550
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,720
Too many.

551
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,610
We keep on saying that,

552
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:22,820
but we're not doing anything about it.

553
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,231
I did.

554
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:25,100
I fucking moved,

555
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:25,580
man.

556
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,760
The only reason why I came back cause
Mrs. Reagan got pregnant and because the

557
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,750
dog had eaten by mountain,

558
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,860
if it wasn't for that,

559
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,250
went to the suburbs then or stuff.

560
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,173
That's my next move.

561
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,970
Almost not like I'm already
talking to real estate agents.

562
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,893
Oh

563
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,990
she'll let you talk [inaudible] Beck.

564
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,440
But the move to move is you go and he'd
get a summer place and you try it out

565
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:49,430
and lived there for a summer.

566
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,293
That's right.

567
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,650
You'd be super nice while you're there.

568
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:55,400
So it becomes on the [inaudible] just
every time we're there I'll just bring

569
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:59,720
home flowers and shit and then we come
back to la and then it's all Jujitsu and

570
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:01,340
loud music and too much pot smoke.

571
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,750
Yeah,

572
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,150
daddy's crazy in la.

573
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,590
Daddy just wants to fight and smoke
pot and he's walking around naked.

574
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,610
No,

575
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,421
in Colorado.

576
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:15,050
Daddy wants to go get ice cream
and daddy's bringing flowers home.

577
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:16,190
See you just train them.

578
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,330
Brown got blowing farts on her.

579
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,291
Here's the problem.

580
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:21,811
Joe Rogan,

581
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:22,400
Scott,

582
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,740
Joe Rogan's got a great
wife and Joe Rogan.

583
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:28,520
I went to his home last week and that
was one of the first times Mrs Rogan was

584
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,600
home and a couple of times,

585
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:31,490
and I'd been up there like four times.

586
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,020
This is Roldan likes to rock the house

587
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,250
and the quantum was up where you live now.

588
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,660
All you gotta do is go
down and who she'd get,

589
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:41,040
the party started where you
put it before motherfuckers.

590
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,680
That's a witness relocation play.

591
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,180
She had to drive 90 miles before she even
seen a daddy's girl who was another 20

592
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:47,391
miles.

593
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:49,040
She was from all the weapon boulder,

594
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,160
the first mall that she cares
about his cherry fucking creek.

595
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,001
You know what I'm saying?

596
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:54,590
So you had a two foils at Denver?

597
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,080
Yeah.

598
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,490
Was groups out away from the more

599
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,480
you got to keep a closer to the wall,

600
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,640
you had a 90 fucking miles dog.

601
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,120
I slipped on the almost blew up.

602
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,800
What am I loved the most living up there.

603
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:07,520
That was that.

604
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,140
There was a small amount of people,

605
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:09,650
man,

606
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,350
smaller boulders only got a
hundred thousand plus people.

607
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,400
Not that much man.

608
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,301
And people are friendly.

609
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,760
I like that there's a more relaxed vibe.

610
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:18,080
And I think that shit is healthy.

611
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,380
I think there's something exciting
about living in a big city,

612
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,670
especially if you're,

613
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,091
you know,

614
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:26,300
you're involved in the hustle and
bustle and you're really trying to make

615
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:27,770
something happen and you know,

616
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,370
it's like,

617
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:28,780
I dunno,

618
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,450
but Casey,

619
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,261
that New York are real.

620
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:31,094
It's a really good,

621
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,970
if you got the voice,

622
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:33,530
you probably get married
again after a week.

623
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:34,364
You dumb fuck.

624
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,480
Talking to a real rogue is
going to shut that far yet.

625
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,380
You've got to figure out a way to get
a fucking coffee hut to the mall of

626
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:43,480
America where the action is.

627
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:43,940
Any of that.

628
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,491
Don't worry about it.

629
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:45,590
Then you've got to move a little closer.

630
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,453
That was too much

631
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,060
and he just needed to move to Texas.

632
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,191
Texas is cool.

633
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:51,024
This is the answer.

634
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,991
I like Austin.

635
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:52,890
I'm a big fan of that.

636
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:53,191
Austin,

637
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:53,581
Texas.

638
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:54,121
I'll tell you that.

639
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:55,650
I'd lived there if I was going to live,

640
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:58,350
but more lane is not legal there.

641
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,480
The thing about Colorado is
it's just like California.

642
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,660
You could just go rockweed everywhere
and people will move to Austin.

643
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,130
No,

644
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,500
no,

645
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,070
not yet.

646
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,530
Not yet.

647
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,390
The shit hits the fan.

648
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:07,201
Anything can happen.

649
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:07,411
You know,

650
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:07,580
when,

651
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,140
when the shit hits the fan and everybody
gets scared and then you start making,

652
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:10,351
you know,

653
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:11,370
survival choices.

654
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,840
You can live in Kansas,

655
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,231
you know,

656
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:14,700
and you'd rather be healthy in Kansas,

657
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:15,300
you know?

658
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,571
But,

659
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:15,970
um,

660
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,260
uh,

661
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,420
the wheat stores in Colorado
are just like out here,

662
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:18,750
Bro.

663
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,920
It's just how they're everywhere.

664
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,890
There's one place in Denver where
there's fucking seven of them on a street

665
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:24,780
there.

666
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,090
Every way easier to get
a license though to same,

667
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,900
same deal.

668
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,733
I get headaches.

669
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,280
Okay.

670
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,610
Bang prescription.

671
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:31,231
So I didn't know.

672
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:31,531
It was like,

673
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:34,570
I don't want you to Adam 20 minutes
away from me when I was shooting it and

674
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,011
we'll be like,

675
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:35,844
yeah,

676
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:36,990
Nice.

677
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,823
Like a doc.

678
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,191
Oh yeah.

679
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:39,810
There's a place that I used
to go to in the mountains.

680
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:43,260
It was like a gift shop and they were
doing do it struggling and they were doing

681
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:44,580
terrible and you know,

682
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,060
the fucking,

683
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,640
they were about to lose their business
and then they started selling weed in the

684
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:49,200
back of the gift shop legal.

685
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:50,220
They've got a legal license.

686
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:50,941
Boom.

687
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:51,980
Now they're balling.

688
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,561
Now they're,

689
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:53,370
they're about to open.

690
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,220
Their one place they opened
up in boulder is supposedly,

691
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:57,300
I don't know if it's open yet,

692
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,030
but they were talking about it was
going to be 30,000 square feet.

693
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:01,290
It was going to be three floors.

694
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,400
I don't know if they went through with it.

695
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:05,010
I need to find out if they did because
that's just the most ridiculous shit I've

696
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:05,610
ever heard.

697
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,360
That's a Goddamn shopping and the
Walmart of weed now Walmart of weed,

698
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,190
but they had great spots there,

699
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:11,401
man.

700
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,181
They had great spots.

701
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:13,014
We can get weed.

702
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,860
I got some no problem.

703
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,070
We two days ago in Hollywood,

704
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,060
it's 31% THC level.

705
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,230
You'll leave.

706
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,570
This shit ain't even necessary,

707
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,440
but again,

708
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,320
it's Matt.

709
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,270
I've been smoking Matt since 2006 and
you got to figure that every year it gets

710
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:27,990
a little stroller.

711
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,400
It's dead straight week.

712
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,590
They pave his girl.

713
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,670
I forgot to bring up,

714
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,140
but it looks like one of the
Martians from Independence Day.

715
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,650
You can see the sativa and
indica grown around it.

716
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,543
It's like a hybrid.

717
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,310
What if I tell you I heard
my joint over that right now.

718
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,170
Are we give it to you now?

719
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:43,800
I went and got it.

720
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,311
No you didn't.

721
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:44,461
Yeah,

722
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:45,600
I didn't go get that shit.

723
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,120
What's it called?

724
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,080
Mac Number one.

725
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:49,914
Oh Gee.

726
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,740
Oh that shit is fucking strong.

727
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,053
I had to go to the gym.

728
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,260
Was fucked up though.

729
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,161
Sounds good.

730
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,310
Dog slide or are we going?

731
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,950
Is going to be front.

732
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,651
Last time we didn't have,

733
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:00,240
all the time I went to Eugene,

734
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,990
Oregon with Jody Ferdy and we had a
Saturday night then for a one night if a

735
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:07,320
Tribble but it was the same night that
there was a convention for like the

736
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,870
Oregon Association of retarded children.

737
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,920
I don't want to say it wrong,

738
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,060
but it was like the children that Special
Olympics and they had a lot of little

739
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:15,421
retire.

740
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:17,100
The kids run around so
when I got to check in,

741
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:18,170
I'm high as a motherfucking.

742
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,080
There's all these kids with
balloons and I'm just freaking,

743
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:22,770
cause Oregon got some beep week.

744
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:23,604
Know what I'm saying?

745
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,020
That's him at the gas station.

746
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,711
Brian,

747
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:26,610
he's going to love this shit.

748
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:27,510
So I got a lighter,

749
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,940
we check into the hotel
in Eugene and the Joe.

750
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,560
This is not 10 or 15 of them.

751
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,720
This is 600 children,

752
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,991
you know,

753
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:34,950
Special Olympics,

754
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,530
200 retarded ones and that parents,

755
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,220
well,

756
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,330
so I go to my room,

757
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:40,440
you know we small,

758
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:41,310
we do the show.

759
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,750
The show is in the hotel,

760
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:43,680
but on a different part,

761
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,820
they're having a little dance.

762
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,871
You had to see this.

763
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:46,830
They were all holding hands,

764
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,860
a little balloons

765
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,170
and the disco and it was very cute to see.

766
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,720
But if a lot with the story,

767
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,460
a lot of people don't
know is retarded guys.

768
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,610
Boys are the strongest motherfuckers in
the world and that most of the verdict

769
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,720
really y'all?

770
00:20:58,721 --> 00:20:59,730
I've heard that it,

771
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,221
boy,

772
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:01,090
they go fucking nuts.

773
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:01,870
Have you seen them?

774
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,950
If you show them your pussy.

775
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,810
So listen to me.

776
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:06,490
We're in the fucking
comedy club in Austin.

777
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:09,100
They switch it at 10 o'clock they
switched it and turn it into a disco

778
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,720
and Jody's got a couple of cocktails
in it and she started dancing.

779
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:14,890
She got the big until he's at the time,

780
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,120
and there's this little retarded boy who
breaks away from the fucking pile and

781
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:23,120
goes into the dance and he starts to
look at Jodi and you could see Joe Rogan

782
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,150
and he's losing his fucking mouth now.

783
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,001
And finally he goes,

784
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:27,610
don't want to dance with
starts dancing with,

785
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,160
right.

786
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,140
He started to answer it.

787
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:29,981
Then he starts crying.

788
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:30,300
They wouldn't.

789
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,020
Jodie thinks it's cute and
all of a sudden they come in,

790
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,341
they're like,

791
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:33,681
hey,

792
00:21:33,681 --> 00:21:35,050
he is this little David,

793
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,830
and they come to grab him and David
fucking snapped like one of those fucking

794
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,570
gorillas in the zoo right now.

795
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:44,640
They had three black doorman that we're
trying to tackle a little Timmy little.

796
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,940
Timmy was drawn them around like Brock
Lesnar thrown around fucking John Fitch.

797
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,580
Just pick the whole
offensive line of the giants.

798
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:56,040
Couldn't help his little retired down
three fucking black gorillas and he's

799
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:56,770
just,

800
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,950
and Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee.

801
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,461
I'm not,

802
00:21:59,461 --> 00:21:59,601
no,

803
00:21:59,601 --> 00:21:59,800
no,

804
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,200
no.

805
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,921
She knows tennies.

806
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:02,150
He went fucking ape shit.

807
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,051
He's pushing them.

808
00:22:03,051 --> 00:22:03,920
The counters came.

809
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,050
They had to throw him on the
fucking floor and put his hand.

810
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,560
Oh no

811
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:08,860
pennies.

812
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,440
He was fucking ape shit dog.

813
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,220
Wow.

814
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,300
Those little cards go fucking bananas
when you show him this little what cars

815
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:16,560
and it was just teddy.

816
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:18,320
Can you imagine if it was
the monkey who went to jail,

817
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,230
Bro,

818
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,270
he's visit University of Eugene.

819
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:22,890
These are big black football players.

820
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,200
They couldn't control
this little 12 year old.

821
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:25,981
He was banging them,

822
00:22:25,981 --> 00:22:30,981
throwing them around like 1212 or 13
just throwing these fucking black guys

823
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:32,310
around and said,

824
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,210
I'd never forget that.

825
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:34,680
That they had to put him on the floor,

826
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,730
handcuff him,

827
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:36,301
shoot him.

828
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:37,230
Tranquilize him.

829
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,430
This little fucking poor kids seem
teddies and he went fucking bananas.

830
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,840
Bananas.

831
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,660
That's crazy.

832
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,420
I wonder if they're just doing
what everybody wants to do,

833
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:47,970
but just doesn't have the ball.

834
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,300
They ha they don't have the walls.

835
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,650
That's a breakdown.

836
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,813
You know what I mean?

837
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,180
Wonder if that's what people
like instinctively want to do.

838
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,173
I think like,

839
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,171
yeah,

840
00:22:57,171 --> 00:22:58,570
it retards can't be like extra,

841
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:00,840
more horny right now.

842
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,320
Probably not extra horny.

843
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:03,340
It's that fan on them.

844
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,811
Sweat light.

845
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:05,710
Joe Rogan's house went,

846
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:06,431
not the electricity.

847
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:06,940
You know what I'm saying?

848
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,773
You're killing me here.

849
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,640
Ooh Bro.

850
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:11,260
This kid went fucking bananas.

851
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:12,340
He ripped that Sherry,

852
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,020
cause you can't even beat them up.

853
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,381
What do you,

854
00:23:14,381 --> 00:23:14,881
what do you do?

855
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:15,151
Do you,

856
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:16,500
you can't drop a bomb on it.

857
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,510
Funny thing was that they built like a
wall at first and they throw them out

858
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,081
first.

859
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:21,750
They asked me to leave and
he was like the building,

860
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,270
two black guys got shoulder to shoulder
and he was grappling their shoulders.

861
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,360
Mm hmm.

862
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,510
I mean it was fucking scary.

863
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:28,760
No,

864
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,230
don't know.

865
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,070
They look bad.

866
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:30,700
You know?

867
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,270
That's one of the weird things about
people that are retarded or down syndrome

868
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:34,880
or whatever.

869
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,130
They don't seem to know.

870
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,060
You know,

871
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,170
they just kind of are,

872
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,180
they just behaved.

873
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:39,550
They don't,

874
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,001
they're like,

875
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:40,381
good,

876
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:40,951
what am I into?

877
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:43,900
A book is mom and they're not like that.

878
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,560
They just themselves.

879
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:45,761
Right.

880
00:23:45,761 --> 00:23:45,980
You know what

881
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,550
I mean?

882
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,140
It's like that must be a strange,

883
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:49,940
strange existence where,

884
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:50,181
you know,

885
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:53,570
that's part of being dumb is that
you're too dumb to realize you're dumb.

886
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:53,871
You know?

887
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,190
And I'm not saying dumb,

888
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:56,750
like there's like they're lazy.

889
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:57,441
Like they have an issue,

890
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:59,990
there's a mental issues and the mental
imbalance or whatever the fuck it is.

891
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,900
But I mean,

892
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,280
they're,

893
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,090
they're impaired,

894
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,050
but there's so impaired,

895
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:04,070
they don't know they're impaired.

896
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,440
Like they've lost the ability
to see that they're impaired.

897
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,400
You know,

898
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,230
what a strange thing,

899
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,380
what if they all have it in her
voice that that's completely normal.

900
00:24:11,381 --> 00:24:11,740
Like,

901
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,820
but they can't take a to be like,

902
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,230
you know,

903
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,800
you know what I mean?

904
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,610
So the whole time there's this,

905
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:15,970
like,

906
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,200
I can't believe how much they
treat me so horrible and I wish I,

907
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:20,531
you know,

908
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:21,190
but they can't,

909
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,001
when they tried to say it,

910
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:23,160
it's like we're married for them.

911
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,280
Well,

912
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,113
there's probably,

913
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,800
there's probably a lot of that.

914
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,070
Yeah.

915
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,620
I think there's a bunch
of different types of,

916
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,220
you know,

917
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,060
being fucked up.

918
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,360
Right.

919
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,691
You know,

920
00:24:31,691 --> 00:24:32,800
for sure there's that too.

921
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,281
You know,

922
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:33,581
it's not,

923
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:34,660
it's not just simple as,

924
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:35,494
yeah.

925
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,490
There's some,

926
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,200
there's varying degrees.

927
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,651
Yeah.

928
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:40,480
There's varying degrees
along the way that are,

929
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:40,691
you know,

930
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:40,901
I mean,

931
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,700
it's fucking crazy thing,

932
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:43,091
man,

933
00:24:43,091 --> 00:24:43,241
to,

934
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:45,040
to have your mind impaired.

935
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,840
You know and look,

936
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,210
look,

937
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,060
our minds are impaired in comparison.

938
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,080
I was watching this fucking 12 year old
kid is autistic kid with 170 Iq doing

939
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,040
his take on the theory of relativity
and he's writing out equations on this

940
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,900
fucking window and I'm watching this kid.

941
00:24:58,901 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm like,

942
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,870
this kid might as well be a fucking alien.

943
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,441
All right,

944
00:25:02,441 --> 00:25:03,460
I don't know what he's doing.

945
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,330
I have no idea.

946
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,370
He's explained this
like this is all simple,

947
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:07,204
simple shit.

948
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,900
When this is so far
beyond my capacity to him,

949
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:11,800
to this artistic kid,

950
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,760
I am retarded.

951
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,451
Okay?

952
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:18,040
I am this guy who he has to humor because
I can't understand a fucking word,

953
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:18,790
a letter,

954
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,560
a singular part of his equation.

955
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,000
I don't know what's going on up there.

956
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,290
It's chaos to me.

957
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,820
But to him it's so clear.

958
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:25,541
It's a language.

959
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:25,781
It's like,

960
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:25,931
well,

961
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:29,170
quite simply you have to move this and
this becomes x equals y equals two.

962
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,210
We are the retards to that kid.

963
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,313
Hmm.

964
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:32,621
You know,

965
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:34,570
maybe like maybe like,

966
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:34,991
you know,

967
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,010
people with down syndrome,

968
00:25:36,011 --> 00:25:38,020
they feel bad when people
don't have down syndrome.

969
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,590
Maybe he's just like us and we feel bad
with people who have autism cause poor

970
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:42,490
kid's got autism,

971
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:42,701
man,

972
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:45,850
he can't engage in all the normal
emotional things that we do.

973
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,241
Meanwhile,

974
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:47,074
this mother fuckers,

975
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:47,411
you know,

976
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:51,940
count counting to a billion in his head
while he's talking to you about how a

977
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:53,800
television is conduct constructed.

978
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,341
You know,

979
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:55,690
maybe we're recharged to them.

980
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,231
Maybe,

981
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:56,441
you know,

982
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:57,280
they look at us and I go,

983
00:25:57,281 --> 00:25:58,001
this is poor fox.

984
00:25:58,001 --> 00:25:59,500
They can't even do math in their head.

985
00:25:59,501 --> 00:25:59,920
They don't,

986
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,100
they can't see through walls that
they can't read people's minds,

987
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,113
you know?

988
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,510
Well,

989
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,680
but some people would just,

990
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,150
I had a kid in the eighth grade,

991
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:09,280
his name is Michael Alig
rather Sicilian kit.

992
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,390
You get been fresh off the boat in the
fucking sixth grade by the eighth grade.

993
00:26:13,391 --> 00:26:15,670
This motherfucker spoke three languages.

994
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,590
The upper know that's a silly and ship.

995
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,940
He picked up Spanish and he picked up
English and I used to just sit and look at

996
00:26:24,941 --> 00:26:25,600
him off.

997
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,171
Do you know what I'm saying?

998
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:29,380
Like he was such a cool motherfucker
that I just wanted to hang with him.

999
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:29,771
He was so,

1000
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:30,551
and he was a married,

1001
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:31,620
we used to play when you,

1002
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,590
when we used to play hockey,

1003
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,850
we hit them in the Chins with the,

1004
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,300
with the hockey stick and he goes,

1005
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,520
oh yeah,

1006
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:35,660
yeah,

1007
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:35,790
yeah,

1008
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:35,940
yeah,

1009
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,070
yeah,

1010
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,903
yeah.

1011
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,080
So I would die.

1012
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,710
He was never progressed
to the bag when my dog,

1013
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:42,650
Michael Allen Bradley.

1014
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,100
But this kid

1015
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,090
knew nothing when we came off a
boat January in the sixth grade,

1016
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:49,950
but the eighth grade knew
three fucking language.

1017
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:51,270
He would talk to me in Spanish,

1018
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,300
talk to you in English
like nothing and get A's.

1019
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:54,631
You know,

1020
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:56,740
some people's work ethic too.

1021
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,080
Some people just,

1022
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,260
they have this insane work ethic and
people would get a chance to come to

1023
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:02,094
America.

1024
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,350
It's so much different
than being born in America.

1025
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,600
We don't have any fucking idea.

1026
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,321
You live,

1027
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:07,591
you know,

1028
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:09,930
you're living in fucking
Guatemala or some shit.

1029
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:10,111
You know,

1030
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:10,350
your,

1031
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,900
your opportunities are
fucking few and far between.

1032
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,291
You know,

1033
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,380
you live in some place
that's impoverished you for,

1034
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:16,800
you're kind of fucked man.

1035
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,360
But when you're in America,

1036
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:18,691
dude,

1037
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:19,650
Holy Shit.

1038
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,431
So these guys,

1039
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:20,671
and you know,

1040
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:21,750
their family gets them together.

1041
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:21,961
Look,

1042
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:22,830
we're going to move to America,

1043
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:25,860
went to have a better life and you
realize you're leaving everything behind.

1044
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,610
You're putting all your fucking ship
and cargo planes and you're all sitting

1045
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:29,881
together,

1046
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:30,481
crammed in,

1047
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:31,530
coach and you know,

1048
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:35,700
eating fruit out of your mom's purse
and just hoping that when you get there

1049
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:37,770
things are going to be better
and you don't know anybody there.

1050
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:38,790
And how scary is this?

1051
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,470
So when those motherfuckers get to school,

1052
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:42,210
they come out guns blazing.

1053
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:42,691
You know,

1054
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:44,580
they appreciate the fact that Holy Shit,

1055
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,260
I used to live in Italy.

1056
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,090
Now here I am in the land of the free,

1057
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:49,290
the home of the brave.

1058
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:49,861
You know,

1059
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:54,210
I'm in America and I'm in school and I'm
learning English and I'm just going to

1060
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:55,830
go fucking crazy over here.

1061
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,170
They're just so happy and she'll be open.

1062
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:01,530
That's the one half of it because
I didn't to leave Cuba corner.

1063
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,190
We moved to,

1064
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,620
I woke up on 89th street
in Riverside drive.

1065
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,360
I had all the fucking things
that a rich kid would have,

1066
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:11,100
rite aid and here I was walking around
this fucking city but I didn't know

1067
00:28:11,101 --> 00:28:15,600
English and all you want to do when your
heart is just fit in and you have no

1068
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:18,660
idea this is not trying to fit in when
you were in grammar school and you should

1069
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:19,401
get a tattoo,

1070
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:20,234
a long hair,

1071
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,180
all you want to know is for them not to
know that you came from somewhere else.

1072
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,580
I can't describe it to you.

1073
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:30,840
I can't even fucking start to tell you
like sometimes I have this anger at me

1074
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:34,080
and it's because I was so lucky.

1075
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,340
We were so lucky.

1076
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,370
I think if three of us could have been
born one of those black kids and fucking

1077
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,510
Haiti would flies on you.

1078
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,280
I need three of us and we have so many
fucking opportunities and sometimes I

1079
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:45,720
wake up in the morning
and this really hits me.

1080
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:49,650
Sometimes I go home and fucking lucky
am I that my mother came here and here I

1081
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:50,900
am sitting here smoking dope.

1082
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,930
I got to go mug somebody.

1083
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,011
You know what I'm saying?

1084
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:53,460
Like,

1085
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,001
think about,

1086
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:55,340
that's what an immigrant was like.

1087
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,980
I'm telling him for a long time I've
been writing this thing and that's how it

1088
00:28:58,981 --> 00:28:59,814
starts with,

1089
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,480
you know,

1090
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,650
I don't remember anything.

1091
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,240
I don't remember the plane ride from Cube.

1092
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,073
I remember nothing.

1093
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,090
All I remember is crossing the fucking
street on 89th and Broadway up to

1094
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,150
[inaudible] 66 and thinking to myself,

1095
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:12,571
finally,

1096
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:13,890
I'm going to be a fucking American.

1097
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,600
What does that mean?

1098
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,950
Looking at that flag,

1099
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,630
really believe in something dog.

1100
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,710
It's not just a piece of fucking
rag looking at that flag and going,

1101
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,970
what the fuck?

1102
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,340
Like looking at the wind
blowing that flag and going,

1103
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,690
what the fuck that flag is the
answer to all my fucking problem.

1104
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,100
That's the answer right there.

1105
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,630
But even at that age,

1106
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:35,070
I knew my mother was fucking crazy,

1107
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:35,940
so I do.

1108
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,410
I wasn't a full fledged American,

1109
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:38,610
but looking at that flag,

1110
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,460
when you look at that flag and you just
come here that they have a scene in the

1111
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:46,120
beginning of Scarface when they were on
the boat and they finally see land and

1112
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:48,460
they show the American
flag and the director,

1113
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:50,590
whoever the guy is
brilliant enough to show,

1114
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,180
he showed it from a different angle.

1115
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,350
What that flag it looks like.

1116
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:56,170
It's not just we overlooked
that flag every fucking day.

1117
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,000
We overlooked that flag.

1118
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,030
You don't know what it is to look at
that flag when you first come here and to

1119
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:02,530
know that that's your fucking,

1120
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,060
that's you're a magic carpet.

1121
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,920
It's the highest ideal in the world.

1122
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,180
It's the highest ideal.

1123
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:10,630
That's why it's so infuriating when
politicians are fucking corrupt.

1124
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,501
That's why it's so,

1125
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:11,711
you know.

1126
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:12,460
People say,

1127
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,470
why do you criticize what
America does overseas?

1128
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:15,370
Don't you love America?

1129
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:15,791
Yeah.

1130
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:16,481
If you love it,

1131
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,580
you want to tell the fucking
truth about what it's doing.

1132
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,030
You know?

1133
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,631
If you love it,

1134
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:20,650
you're supposed to stand up and go,

1135
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:21,910
what the fuck is going on?

1136
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:25,870
It's like you don't love it by letting
it get away with stupid shit because

1137
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:27,190
there's some corrupt content.

1138
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:28,540
The wheel that's not,

1139
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,520
it doesn't mean you don't
love the idea of America.

1140
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,590
I fucking love the idea
of America for sure.

1141
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:35,140
I'm always remember we only
see the one side of that flag.

1142
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,840
We never see both sides
together gentlemen,

1143
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,610
and that's a point we never,

1144
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:42,220
we only see that one side
of the flag right now.

1145
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:45,580
You've discussed at the CIA
is setting up things in Libya.

1146
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,600
What are they setting up?

1147
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,041
Let's start.

1148
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:47,400
No War,

1149
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,310
let's start in business.

1150
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,900
They're getting things going.

1151
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,750
That's the other side of that
flag that were never able to see.

1152
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,400
We always see once you put a mirror
on the other side of the flag,

1153
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,081
you know what I'm saying?

1154
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:57,910
That's the one side of
the flag that we have.

1155
00:30:57,911 --> 00:30:59,680
Since we accept this side of the flag,

1156
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,940
we got to accept that.

1157
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:05,170
So the only way that side this side is
possible where it's easy to drive around

1158
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,700
as if they're doing all this creepy shit.

1159
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,390
You got to break.

1160
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:11,140
Unless we bring the whole world together
in on everything and that's just not

1161
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:13,310
going to happen and we've
done creepy fucking shit.

1162
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,060
They're going to do
creepy shit to trust them.

1163
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:16,481
You know,

1164
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:16,750
we,

1165
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,280
you can't trust people to be cool.

1166
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,701
You know,

1167
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:19,121
the look,

1168
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:20,170
the natural instinct,

1169
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:23,290
if someone can get into a
position of power is to be Kadafi.

1170
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,700
That's the natural instinct.

1171
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,800
That natural instinct is to get botox.

1172
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,560
When you're 80 you have this
big stupid looking rubber face,

1173
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,620
wear goofy clothes and
just be running shit.

1174
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,210
Even though you're this old con,

1175
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:34,871
you know,

1176
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:37,270
living in some fucking castle
with billions of dollars.

1177
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:37,811
He doing that.

1178
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:38,170
Joe,

1179
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,390
can you tell me why is he doing it?

1180
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,740
Maybe we put that billions
of dollars for money.

1181
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,960
That other side of that flag is money.

1182
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:44,620
Joe Rogan,

1183
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,360
that's a lot of people
never had comprehend,

1184
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,810
but that's the reality of it.

1185
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,570
Standup is a beautiful thing to do.

1186
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:50,080
Yeah.

1187
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,140
Some guys are brilliant and
some guys aren't brilliant.

1188
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:52,690
A millionaires.

1189
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,010
The other fall between the crack,

1190
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,380
the other side of the standup,

1191
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,100
it's a business.

1192
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,530
Yeah.

1193
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,240
It really is a fucking business guys.

1194
00:31:58,241 --> 00:31:59,051
And it's like anything else.

1195
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,720
The other side of that
flag is a business guys,

1196
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,650
and the same way we want social
security one was 65 a country.

1197
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:05,861
I said,

1198
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:06,100
dude,

1199
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,670
sell a couple kilos every once in a
while to replenish those fucking phones.

1200
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,533
You know what I'm saying?

1201
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,430
And that's a side of the American public.

1202
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,264
Don't want to know.

1203
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,130
That's the side that included Kennedy.

1204
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,520
That's aside the Alex Jones talks
about whether it's true or not,

1205
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,120
that's a side we not supposed to see
what's supposed to be focused on the other

1206
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:25,450
side on what that machine
is supposed to mean to us.

1207
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,250
And for guys like you and I,

1208
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,510
I like looking behind the curtain,

1209
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:29,344
but I don't,

1210
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,350
I don't because I grew up in a,

1211
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:35,410
in a corrupt hometown and I seen
what politics is at a minute level.

1212
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,380
I can't even dream of what it is
and and national fucking level.

1213
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,020
When,

1214
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,530
uh,

1215
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,070
I'm taking political contributions but
I'm going to pass your fucking bills so

1216
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:44,360
you could pass that law.

1217
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:46,700
That will make people's hands grow back,

1218
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,950
but they're also going to give
him cancer when the eyeballs,

1219
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,023
that's part of it.

1220
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,893
It grows.

1221
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,190
When I grew up in it,

1222
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:54,260
when it was in the micro process,

1223
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,030
now it's in the national
level of corruption isn't a
macro process and it starts

1224
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:03,650
with little things and townships where
if it's a macro smaller than my micro

1225
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:03,991
macro,

1226
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:04,521
I'm a little high.

1227
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:05,354
I'm sorry guys,

1228
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,820
but you understand my pill.

1229
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,641
Exactly what you're saying.

1230
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:08,160
It's a,

1231
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,230
it's very interesting.

1232
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,131
Corruption.

1233
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:11,510
If not checked grows.

1234
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,770
It all just keeps getting bigger.

1235
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:13,550
It's not like they go,

1236
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:13,761
hey,

1237
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:14,780
we got to cut the shit.

1238
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,030
I know we've been making millions
of dollars on the sneak tip,

1239
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:19,490
but everybody's got to stop
right now and I'm not kidding.

1240
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,190
Why are you still making money?

1241
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,560
These wiki leak things are
pretty cool for the country.

1242
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,800
I think that's why these assholes
want to put that guy in jail.

1243
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:28,360
They want to say compromises Americans.

1244
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:28,691
No,

1245
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:29,261
it doesn't.

1246
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:29,501
He,

1247
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:31,870
he did exactly what the New
York Times was supposed to do.

1248
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:33,040
If they got that information.

1249
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,750
They should have done
that on Twitter though.

1250
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:37,090
Can you imagine if there was just like
this Twitter address that everyone

1251
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:38,900
followed that tweet later.

1252
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:39,731
By the way,

1253
00:33:39,731 --> 00:33:40,331
JFK,

1254
00:33:40,331 --> 00:33:44,380
here's pictures of JFK selling cocaine
to Wiki leaks has a Twitter and they were

1255
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,930
doing they really shit on the Twitter.

1256
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:47,811
They released a,

1257
00:33:47,811 --> 00:33:48,521
some uh,

1258
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:48,840
an artist,

1259
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,100
an article

1260
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,240
about how um,

1261
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:50,750
different,

1262
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:50,960
uh,

1263
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,220
parts of the American
economy are influenced by
genetically modified foods and

1264
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:57,230
how we're trying to force
them on other countries.

1265
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,210
And then where you're like
fucking with other countries,

1266
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:01,580
if they don't go into the
genetically modified food,

1267
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,250
if they don't start
growing like Monsanto corn,

1268
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:04,940
shit like that,

1269
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,151
you know,

1270
00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:05,390
those,

1271
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:05,631
that,

1272
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:05,870
that,

1273
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,381
that those,

1274
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:09,380
these giant companies are way too
embedded into the political system.

1275
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,260
They're not doing stuff for the greater
good of people there doing stuff for the

1276
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:15,710
profitability of giant corporations that
moved him into position in the first

1277
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:16,130
place.

1278
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,600
The whole thing has been corrupted.

1279
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,120
Like to sit down and pretend that that,

1280
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,470
that,

1281
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,261
that it's real.

1282
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:22,280
It's insulting.

1283
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,020
It's like,

1284
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,560
it's like a stupid argument.

1285
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,750
It's like people argue
about pro wrestling,

1286
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,171
you know,

1287
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:27,441
it's like,

1288
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,610
what are you arguing about?

1289
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:30,920
This is a fake nonsense process.

1290
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,620
If you can't notice that from Obama,

1291
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,790
Obama is going to pull
all the troop out of Ikea.

1292
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,081
Oh,

1293
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:36,914
he's not.

1294
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,311
Oh,

1295
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:41,540
Bama won the Nobel Peace Prize and then
he sent 30,000 more fucking troops to

1296
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:42,374
Afghanistan.

1297
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:42,681
I mean,

1298
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,514
come on man.

1299
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,670
Look at all the shit that he's done
to allow these cons to get away with

1300
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:48,710
stealing all that fucking
money in that bailout.

1301
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,570
I watched that inside job movie,

1302
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,141
Dude.

1303
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:53,030
That shit is disgusting.

1304
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,320
It's disgusting.

1305
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,370
How deep the corruption is.

1306
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:56,091
The financial,

1307
00:34:56,091 --> 00:34:56,231
uh,

1308
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:56,361
the,

1309
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,590
the whole financial sector.

1310
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,580
It's scary,

1311
00:34:58,581 --> 00:34:59,060
dude.

1312
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,350
They have the people that are regulators
eventually get jobs with the banks.

1313
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,510
Like how the fuck you're telling me you
work as a guy who's working for the SEC

1314
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,210
and you're looking into banks and
corruption and shit like that.

1315
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,260
And then when you quit,

1316
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:13,790
you get a job with the bank.

1317
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,010
How the fuck are you not in jail?

1318
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,650
How the fuck are you not in jail?

1319
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,060
You were the one responsible for looking
over these motherfuckers while they

1320
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:25,100
were doing all sorts of crazy shit,

1321
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,960
betting on things failing and betting
three times more than that a business is

1322
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,320
worth and specular lives and and and,

1323
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:32,961
and bedding.

1324
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:33,470
Again,

1325
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,410
fucking forcing clients to buy
shit they knew wasn't good.

1326
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,140
Like they did a lot of crazy
creepy shit and got away with it.

1327
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,630
I'm the only one who got
popped is that Bernie Madoff,

1328
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,870
those mother fuckers
should all be in jail.

1329
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,960
This should be amass
jailing and they're not.

1330
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,010
They're not jailing anybody then
it's bullshit then it's all bullshit.

1331
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,720
It's all bullshit that they're not you.

1332
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,310
You gotta like hold them the the most
accountable you can and it's barely at all

1333
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,300
people's dreams,

1334
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,680
people's dreams.

1335
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,780
When you steal people's dreams,

1336
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,460
that's the worst thing
in the fucking world.

1337
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,550
You're 63 years old also.

1338
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,700
Somebody calls you and says,

1339
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:13,500
you're not going to get you your money
at 66 or 67 all that money you put away.

1340
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,281
That happens.

1341
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:15,290
Those guys a lot too.

1342
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,160
It's happened to a lot of fucking people.

1343
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:17,840
People at six,

1344
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,200
I just watched something
about a month ago,

1345
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:23,850
people 71 getting part time
fucking jobs now the 69

1346
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,830
can movie showed.

1347
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,250
Um,

1348
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,570
I believe it was Iceland.

1349
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,400
How they went in and Jack the Icelandic
economy and like a couple of years these

1350
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:37,401
banks went in and just fucking did is
created baubles and started making crazy

1351
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:37,750
money,

1352
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,460
spending an access and then it
all failed and people are fucked.

1353
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,050
They had like the most stable,

1354
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:43,650
the most,

1355
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,180
a normalized economy.

1356
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,770
Like it was a beautiful economy.

1357
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,510
Everything was running smooth people.

1358
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:49,560
We're hard workers.

1359
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:50,640
People got shit done.

1360
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,010
They lived a life of relative prosperity.

1361
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,620
Now that fucked everybody lost everything.

1362
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,520
Everyone's fucked.

1363
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,110
Do you think that the states,

1364
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,230
I think it already has,

1365
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,191
every has,

1366
00:37:01,191 --> 00:37:02,010
what does this bailout?

1367
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,221
What did,

1368
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:02,750
what is this?

1369
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,200
How do you,

1370
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,450
how did these people get money when,

1371
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:06,530
when their banks failed,

1372
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:06,711
they,

1373
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:06,851
they,

1374
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:07,161
they will,

1375
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:07,411
they,

1376
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:09,320
they have bonuses in
their contract bonuses.

1377
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,460
How the fuck do you get a bonus when the
bank feels like the idea that you have

1378
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:15,440
to respect them and that they can't lose?

1379
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,570
That's just [inaudible].

1380
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,640
It's so cool.

1381
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:18,790
Ropy the size,

1382
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,910
the bonuses,

1383
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,710
millions and millions of dollars,

1384
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,240
and this is from banks.

1385
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,250
What we would check to pay them.

1386
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,010
We gave them money and
they're giving out money.

1387
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:28,881
Either way.

1388
00:37:28,881 --> 00:37:30,580
If your bank fucking failed,

1389
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,300
you can't get a bonus.

1390
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,290
You can't get a bonus.

1391
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,360
I'm certainly as big bank fucking failed.

1392
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,550
Do you take no pump
personal responsibility?

1393
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,990
Like who takes responsibility?

1394
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,650
Somebody and it you shouldn't it be
the guy that stands to make a bonus?

1395
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,790
If the bank does well,

1396
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,740
that should be the guy who
takes personal responsibility.

1397
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,360
So when the bank fucking fails,

1398
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,010
you don't get your bonus comp face.

1399
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:49,730
It's it.

1400
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,630
It's that simple.

1401
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:50,941
Why?

1402
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:54,140
Why the fuck he had the president say
that is the studies like we're going to,

1403
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:54,521
you know,

1404
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:56,450
low limited to half of million dollars,

1405
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,280
half a million fucking dollars
for a bonus when your bank fails,

1406
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:01,880
what do you want?

1407
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,140
These motherfuckers are so not living
in reality in most people's reality,

1408
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,230
these cons costs so many fucking people.

1409
00:38:09,231 --> 00:38:12,360
Their life savings and they have to
get their bonuses and the president was

1410
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:12,501
like,

1411
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:12,710
Whoa,

1412
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,730
we have to give them to them.

1413
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,530
What the fuck are you talking about?

1414
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:16,670
You have to give it to them.

1415
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:17,840
You can't just step in.

1416
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:18,920
They'll cut the shit.

1417
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,570
Are you fucking crazy?

1418
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:20,901
No.

1419
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:24,260
You can't get $30 million
after your fucking bank fails.

1420
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:24,591
No.

1421
00:38:24,591 --> 00:38:28,010
In the middle of a crazy down to
economy where billions of dollars from

1422
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:31,190
taxpayers while he'd been funneled
to fucking banks to keep them afloat.

1423
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,431
No,

1424
00:38:31,431 --> 00:38:32,860
you can't get a bonus fuck head.

1425
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,400
You're lucky you have a job.

1426
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:34,821
You're lucky.

1427
00:38:34,821 --> 00:38:36,220
Your head is attached to your fucking

1428
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,670
shoulder.

1429
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,320
Not Get a 90 fucking years.

1430
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:38,711
Yeah,

1431
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:40,930
you lucky you're not in
jail forever in Haiti.

1432
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,730
Have you followed what's going
on in the city of Bell Bell?

1433
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,521
Bell Bell.

1434
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:49,270
California is a city that the
fucking guys just jacked him.

1435
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,330
What happened like the fuck you got to
get up early in the water for this cause

1436
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,710
they talking about like Ktc la.

1437
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:58,420
It's a city here of bell off the six
Oh five or something and all the man,

1438
00:38:58,421 --> 00:38:58,871
everybody,

1439
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:00,790
it was as corrupt as can be.

1440
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,310
They have been jack in millions,

1441
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,710
so if it's at that city of Bell,

1442
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,370
if the corruption is that the cops
will have any ticket contests.

1443
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,180
Really?

1444
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,100
Oh this is everyday on the news.

1445
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:13,120
They come up with more shit.

1446
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:14,500
The guy just got reinvited.

1447
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,480
This is old school jerseys.

1448
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,830
Schilling school.

1449
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,030
Here's Bell Bell,

1450
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:19,751
California.

1451
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:20,860
It's I think like

1452
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,590
30 minutes from here,

1453
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,660
30 45 minutes.

1454
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,770
But they just been having this shit
and then lately it's a shitstorm.

1455
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,430
They all go,

1456
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,360
they will all steel it.

1457
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,790
All five guys were stealing big bulls.

1458
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:38,530
Understand how they feel like no one's
going to get caught fucking trail.

1459
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,080
Remember Goodfellas and Robert De Niro
how to start killing people because

1460
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:42,070
they're spending too much money.

1461
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,850
That's the same goddamn thing.

1462
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,380
Man.

1463
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,610
That was a great scene,

1464
00:39:45,611 --> 00:39:46,210
wasn't it?

1465
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,590
When you realized the guy came in,

1466
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:49,480
his wife had a fucking
beautiful fur coat on.

1467
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,620
It's like what the fuck are you doing?

1468
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:51,571
And then they did.

1469
00:39:51,571 --> 00:39:53,130
They know they have to
kill this guy and then the,

1470
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:55,330
it's photos of him and
his wife shot in the car.

1471
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:00,100
What a great God damn movie that was on
the other night and I walked in the part

1472
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:03,790
with them at the mother's house
and then borrowing the knife.

1473
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,480
But you got to think of that whole scene
that Barbara had a knife to stab this

1474
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:08,314
guy in the car.

1475
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,480
Me One while they're eating the guys
in the trunk of the fucking car and

1476
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:11,810
everything.

1477
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,730
Like it's the 4th of July there.

1478
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,470
Eat the eggs and bread and fucking telling
stories and remember the paint thing.

1479
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,030
Then one for me that is such a
sick fucking movie right there.

1480
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,030
Right moving.

1481
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,780
What do you want from me?

1482
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,130
There's not that many of those.

1483
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,740
There's very few of those
that ever get that good.

1484
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,020
You know,

1485
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,900
it was very few movies
that ever like hit that.

1486
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,310
That's like a perfect movie.

1487
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,290
Goodfellas is like a
perfect fucking movie.

1488
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,460
Everything about it,

1489
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,300
especially when you see it 20 years later
when she was screaming at Ray Liotta

1490
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:40,760
and he runs,

1491
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,570
he starts laughing and runs away
cause gacked out of his fucking mind.

1492
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,350
She's screaming at him and he's laughing
and when they were were packaging up

1493
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:49,840
the coke and his girlfriend
was getting pissed off,

1494
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,261
you know,

1495
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:50,490
she's,

1496
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,540
cause he's got to just fucking
making coke for him now.

1497
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,570
And he was banging her on the side
still with his wife and he's got her

1498
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,260
packaging coke form and then you know,

1499
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:57,481
he,

1500
00:40:57,481 --> 00:41:00,330
he leaves laughing and she fucking
throws the coke at the door.

1501
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,570
You remember that shit is the craziest
thing ever is the craziest thing ever

1502
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,490
when he gets to that scene.

1503
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,530
And I did coke for 30 years,

1504
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:12,460
when he gets to that scene and he snorts
and he pops his head up and his eyes

1505
00:41:12,461 --> 00:41:15,460
dilate right in front of the
camera that seen as well.

1506
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:16,580
I turn the movie off.

1507
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,321
Really?

1508
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:18,570
It bothers me to go.

1509
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,130
And you know what bothers me
because he steals it though.

1510
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,190
He taps into the coach when he's
standing there with his arms.

1511
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,790
Watch it again when she's weighing it
and he's standing there with his arms

1512
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:28,180
folded.

1513
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,570
Let me tell you,

1514
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,650
you see him with my honors float.

1515
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,990
That means your potential energy,

1516
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:33,040
you're ready to explode.

1517
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,850
You can't even take watching that.

1518
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:35,684
Fill that bucket.

1519
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,610
Then below what he sees,

1520
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:40,640
the fucking that helicopter
and you know it's behind you.

1521
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,380
That chitter chatter they have.

1522
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,610
That's paranoid talk.

1523
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:46,970
Why can't we go to your mother's house
when they dropped the guns off and you

1524
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,541
imagine Joe,

1525
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,640
what can we go to your mother's
house and drop off guns?

1526
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,440
They had this Cheddar chive when he
gets out of jail and he's famous for the

1527
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:58,490
coke and he comes home and he's trying
to tell her that he wanted for money.

1528
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,930
He wants to get high.

1529
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:00,920
I been there,

1530
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,010
Cara.

1531
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:02,560
Karen,

1532
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,231
what'd you do?

1533
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:04,190
It was what we saw.

1534
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:09,191
We had care and that whole chitter chatter
looking how high he just passes out

1535
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,050
and just pass up.

1536
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,650
Perfect.

1537
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,011
Yeah.

1538
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:15,170
They just pass out from
the [inaudible] side.

1539
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,311
That's all.

1540
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:17,144
We had.

1541
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,720
$60,000 no fucking thing
he had in the ceiling.

1542
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:20,900
What?

1543
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,100
The cops rating the founder.

1544
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,180
Great fucking movie,

1545
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,040
but it's amazing when he's looking up
at the helicopters and he's so fucking

1546
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,040
yes.

1547
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,910
When he uses the car and
he thought it was over it.

1548
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:31,940
He's getting rid of guns,

1549
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:32,211
right?

1550
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:32,491
Wasn't he?

1551
00:42:32,491 --> 00:42:33,050
Yeah.

1552
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:37,280
You have no idea what it is to get coked
up in this little room and look out

1553
00:42:37,281 --> 00:42:39,080
that window by the blonde.

1554
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,830
That's like,

1555
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,193
there'll be a,

1556
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,431
what do you call those things?

1557
00:42:43,431 --> 00:42:44,264
A fire hydrant,

1558
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,630
but in your mind it becomes a dog.

1559
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:50,920
Could you imagine if you've got
like Osama bin Ladin coked up.

1560
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,450
Could you imagine if you've got someone,

1561
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,550
someone like Gadhafi coked up right now,

1562
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,020
how paranoid he would be.

1563
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,950
I think just how it's done.

1564
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,780
Is it you think he does calorie?

1565
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:01,150
If of course you're a fucking terrorist,

1566
00:43:01,151 --> 00:43:03,210
you're probably fucking
fucking hookers looking.

1567
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,570
Coffee's not a terrorist.

1568
00:43:04,571 --> 00:43:05,110
He's a,

1569
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:05,711
he's a dictator.

1570
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:06,130
I mean,

1571
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,920
I mean there's some he's,

1572
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,650
but I mean,

1573
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,070
yeah,

1574
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:09,903
he's the same thing.

1575
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:10,601
It was a bad,

1576
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:11,434
bad person.

1577
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,130
Enemy,

1578
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:12,720
bad person.

1579
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,020
That was a guy called Carlos,

1580
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:17,540
something that was part of the middle
cartel in the 80s bad motherfucker.

1581
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:20,150
The one that was in charge
of bring it up all the blow.

1582
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:21,420
He got so crazy.

1583
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,240
I'm not in a dear call.

1584
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:23,871
Lowe's.

1585
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:24,261
Yeah.

1586
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:24,981
What's his last name?

1587
00:43:24,981 --> 00:43:26,500
He resonate dear cause Nicola.

1588
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:26,730
Yeah.

1589
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:26,960
Yeah.

1590
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,531
He was the one that,

1591
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:28,191
that the blow up,

1592
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:31,430
I might've made that up blow was the
guy in the island that he went to visit

1593
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,130
Johnny Depp,

1594
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,270
the guy with the blue eyes.

1595
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,780
We had the machine guns
and shit with this guy.

1596
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,681
His name is Carlo,

1597
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:40,130
laid their cold calls a day.

1598
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,570
Dad got his sentence reduced.

1599
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,210
He got like 900 years
knocked off his sentence.

1600
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:46,130
He still got four Pete hundred more to do.

1601
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,870
He's the one that went from
the government and said,

1602
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,080
dawn,

1603
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,770
I gave for adult envelopes
face to face bow and uh,

1604
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:52,280
Carlos,

1605
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:52,700
they dead.

1606
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,390
How they nailed him was he was actually
getting cameras like Ryan does,

1607
00:43:56,391 --> 00:43:57,380
sending them around the room.

1608
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:59,360
He'd get a plate below.

1609
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:03,500
He'd sit there and lick it with a towel
on and just do bumps and every once in a

1610
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:06,070
while he'd go like this or chicken
coming to suck his dick get smacked.

1611
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,240
He'd do more blow.

1612
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,630
Just tell poetry all day.

1613
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,380
And finally they got the mentally cartel
got their hands on this and they were

1614
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:15,621
like,

1615
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:16,454
this can't happen.

1616
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,780
Get Bullshit on the phone.

1617
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:18,614
Bush,

1618
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,650
we've got something for you.

1619
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:20,000
Right.

1620
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,200
I'll tell you exactly where he is.

1621
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:22,520
We're going to email to take it.

1622
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,980
Really fundamentally
cartel gave him up real.

1623
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:26,541
Exactly.

1624
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:26,751
Yeah,

1625
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,920
because they couldn't take that.

1626
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:31,740
This guy was folded and he's
making videos of himself naked,

1627
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,000
sweating with his eyes.

1628
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:35,960
This big blow for 24 hours pops.

1629
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,280
Fuck Charlie Sheen.

1630
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,230
This guy was naked doing bumps and,

1631
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,630
and you know saying him
talking about La Luna,

1632
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:43,591
you know,

1633
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:48,591
stars and the mountains and then he
would go online and check would come and

1634
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:50,430
suck his dick and he was like,

1635
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,323
shoot her,

1636
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,710
shoot her on tape.

1637
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,543
And they just keep,

1638
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,480
you see him pull the by rankles he should,

1639
00:44:55,481 --> 00:44:57,920
he'd be bleeding fucked and
then he'd do more blood.

1640
00:44:57,921 --> 00:44:59,040
And I wish I was lying to you.

1641
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,000
This guy was killing people
and tape doing blogs.

1642
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:02,834
Just sweat,

1643
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,260
not eating for days.

1644
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,150
Brilliant Shit.

1645
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:07,020
And then they stick.

1646
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:08,700
One of the million cartel
got this and they're like,

1647
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:09,534
we can't have this.

1648
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,790
They went and got him
and brought him back.

1649
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:14,980
They still have those pictures of him
on the plane next to a marine and he's

1650
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:15,811
just looking around like,

1651
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:17,010
what the fuck do I do?

1652
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:18,450
He looks back and you turned them in.

1653
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,900
Holy Shit.

1654
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,510
Did you see you saw cocaine cowboys,

1655
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:22,850
right?

1656
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:23,230
Yeah.

1657
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:23,470
No.

1658
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,041
That woman,

1659
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,540
what's her name is Zelda?

1660
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,320
Zelda.

1661
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,250
She's out.

1662
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,960
She's back in Columbia,

1663
00:45:28,961 --> 00:45:29,794
man.

1664
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,610
They got pictures of her in Columbia
at the airport hanging out free.

1665
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,691
And this,

1666
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:35,680
this is the movie,

1667
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:39,040
just detail after detail how
many people she had killed.

1668
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:39,690
Wow.

1669
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:40,523
That bitch,

1670
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,441
the Godmother,

1671
00:45:41,441 --> 00:45:42,730
I think they call their Griselda.

1672
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,590
She made so much money,

1673
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,680
hundreds and hundreds of millions
of dollars and Koch money,

1674
00:45:47,681 --> 00:45:48,280
man,

1675
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,750
she was killing people left and right.

1676
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:53,230
They got this guy who's her hit man who's
in jail and they interview him in jail

1677
00:45:53,231 --> 00:45:56,020
and he's just telling them all the
different times Griselda have made me kill

1678
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:56,411
this guy.

1679
00:45:56,411 --> 00:45:58,750
So I had to go do some business
and that killed this guy,

1680
00:45:58,751 --> 00:45:59,770
how to do some business.

1681
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:00,401
And I said,

1682
00:46:00,401 --> 00:46:03,400
I wouldn't do that because they wanted
me to do a drive by and there was a baby

1683
00:46:03,401 --> 00:46:04,234
in the car

1684
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:04,541
like,

1685
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:05,840
whoa.

1686
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,130
It was fucking Colombians.

1687
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:08,290
They used to shoot anything.

1688
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,920
There's a picture of you
go on Daily News archives.

1689
00:46:11,921 --> 00:46:16,090
1984 a Columbian family in
Brooklyn got slaughtered.

1690
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:16,940
Well,

1691
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,740
the room for the wake was 14
bodies and there was 12 kids.

1692
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,351
Oh my.

1693
00:46:21,351 --> 00:46:25,360
They sat the kids down who the 12 and
put bullets in and they're fucking

1694
00:46:25,361 --> 00:46:25,840
forehead.

1695
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,651
Oh my God.

1696
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:27,401
The pictures just,

1697
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:28,390
they don't show the bodies,

1698
00:46:28,391 --> 00:46:32,330
but they show the funeral parlor
and just the row of fucking body.

1699
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,870
It's just come on beans and over nothing.

1700
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:38,410
This isn't the 80s when they were shooting
you over $2 just to make that point,

1701
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:41,140
you know you always fucking
money was going to shoot you.

1702
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,790
That was the big thing about them,

1703
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:43,031
right?

1704
00:46:43,031 --> 00:46:45,700
The Colombians were always taught to
be the most like Colombian neckties.

1705
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:47,470
They'd go for fucking throw down,

1706
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,573
pull your tongue out.

1707
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:49,240
They wanted,

1708
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,710
they wanted an intimidation at the
maximum under the fucking savages,

1709
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,300
and that's right next door to us,

1710
00:46:55,301 --> 00:46:55,830
buddy.

1711
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:56,200
That's,

1712
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,870
that's just like what's going on in
Mexico that's happening right now.

1713
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,561
But in a bigger,

1714
00:46:59,561 --> 00:47:00,790
even bigger scale,

1715
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:01,241
you know,

1716
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:02,170
because the Colombians,

1717
00:47:02,171 --> 00:47:04,930
even though they had like they were
selling drugs and they were bringing drugs

1718
00:47:04,931 --> 00:47:07,720
and they weren't getting that much
resistance from their government.

1719
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,481
You know what I mean?

1720
00:47:08,481 --> 00:47:09,400
There's Kinda correct.

1721
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:10,440
It was part of their,

1722
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:10,791
actually,

1723
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:10,960
yeah,

1724
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,711
it was kind of corrupt.

1725
00:47:11,711 --> 00:47:13,780
But in Mexico it's not the same man.

1726
00:47:13,781 --> 00:47:14,201
Mexico,

1727
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:15,400
they get a lot of resistance,

1728
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,311
but it doesn't matter.

1729
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:17,144
Still was doing it.

1730
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:17,831
They're still doing it.

1731
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:21,370
So it's scarier because it's
more like it's more militaristic,

1732
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,204
you know,

1733
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,410
action in Spanish.

1734
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,850
[inaudible] below more or Blanca.

1735
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:29,770
That's the Bro.

1736
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,190
That's a silver fish.

1737
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,730
That's a finished from the rubber guard.

1738
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,670
The Lomo or blind log this call,

1739
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:38,110
either bullets or money.

1740
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,180
Which one do they just
show up and which ones?

1741
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:41,014
Bullets.

1742
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,940
A global plumber is bullets.

1743
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:43,240
Yeah.

1744
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,890
Blanca is a lot of times cash.

1745
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,360
So plot that they just
show up at your house,

1746
00:47:47,361 --> 00:47:48,580
but a gun down when an envelope,

1747
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,710
a little more block that
she would get a new rap song

1748
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,880
and your bitch,

1749
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:55,960
that's how they were corrupt.

1750
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,123
Colombo,

1751
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,380
poor fucking girl who was a member.

1752
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,670
That girl was trying
to be a sheriff and uh,

1753
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,670
some town in near Juarez,

1754
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,271
remember that shit?

1755
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:08,140
She was 20 years old.

1756
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:12,280
There's a big story because
this is college girl decides
she's going to fucking

1757
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:16,540
get a job as a sheriff and tried
to clean up the town within months.

1758
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,810
This poor girl is trying
to seek asylum in America.

1759
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,870
They're trying to kill her,

1760
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,130
although slice your fucking throat,

1761
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:21,980
you know,

1762
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,330
you're either in or you're out because
you know there's no coming back.

1763
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:25,841
There's no,

1764
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:26,200
no,

1765
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:26,830
no.

1766
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:27,970
That's a different society.

1767
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,090
This isn't the terrifying man.

1768
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:30,953
This isn't,

1769
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,610
it's terrifying shit.

1770
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:33,970
You know,

1771
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:34,803
it's terrifying.

1772
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,300
It's terrifying that we are
not doing anything about it.

1773
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:38,680
But yet we were fucking around in Libya,

1774
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:39,171
April one,

1775
00:48:39,171 --> 00:48:40,120
1984.

1776
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:41,740
December 12th of 1984,

1777
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:42,780
I was minding my business,

1778
00:48:42,781 --> 00:48:43,614
or 83,

1779
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,030
I was minding my business
is Snowmass village.

1780
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:47,010
I didn't know nothing about nothing.

1781
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,950
Let was just snorting coke and going to
school at [inaudible] and he just had an

1782
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:53,090
electrician's job and I heard this boom,

1783
00:48:53,091 --> 00:48:53,411
boom.

1784
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:54,280
But I didn't know what happened.

1785
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:55,810
I just went to bed the next day,

1786
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:58,310
they were telling me a story about this
drug dealer named Steven Gray Buck.

1787
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,230
He got in a fucking car with the
started up and they put a bomb under his

1788
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:02,800
