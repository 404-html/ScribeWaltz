1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,070
The Joe Rogan experience,
man,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,290
when I,
when I used to make it taste good,

3
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:06,570
but now I don't even make the gel shake
taste good anymore.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,500
Now I'm going to slam.
It just tastes terrible because I'd give

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,100
a giant chunks of ginger and garlic now
like I'll have like a,

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,420
like seriously?
Remember what pagers used to look like?

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,050
A chunk of ginger.
Just fucking camera shake.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,020
Put in one shake.
You slammed that Ninja turtles have

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,590
about half of that in a week.
Shake.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,520
Oh really?
No.

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,370
I slam it.
Slam it in four or five cloves of

12
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:35,310
garlic.
Smells so bad afterwards.

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,290
Smelling like garlic can take for sure.
Well,

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,310
good jokes man.
I smell

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,410
like garlic.
Just train you.

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,780
No,
just uh,

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,250
just ate some garlic loads.
Yeah.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,233
Become horrible.

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,580
Let me know.
Next time you're in the

20
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,790
tests and mood to make a video
to youtube hits off of that.

21
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,090
All you'd have to do.
It's just I would come on the desk and

22
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:12,660
just dip your finger and go like that.
That's all you would have to do.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,400
It's over
the you youtube would break.

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,420
I'm sure you've got the curdled kind
where you could just pick up.

25
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,430
No,
my login.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,730
Very normal,
fertile time.

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,850
This shit took a lot of water,
dude.

28
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,763
Oh,
that's true.

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,680
Healthy.
My loads of quite fluid taste like

30
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:39,450
garlic and this is back at the academy.
Male crew right here.

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,680
Imagine if dudes or chicks,
whereas women have a certain amount of

32
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:45,390
eggs and then that's it.
It's over.

33
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,060
Imagine if dudes were like that.
We have a certain amount of loads.

34
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,100
You're like checking.
You pulled your balls up the sun to see

35
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:57,150
like where your load line is.
A lot of people that have to do.

36
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,130
A lot of people would have blue balls,
that's for sure.

37
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,970
The next day.
Oh Wow.

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,460
Girls would be like,
come on,

39
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,310
give me some low.
You're not worth it.

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,193
You're not worth.
It.

41
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,790
Should become until like a gambling
rational thing.

42
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,300
Guys would go in and they'd go,
tantric where you squeeze it down to

43
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,490
orgasm.
If that was the tip of your Dick and

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,820
like a lighter,
and if that was a case that was the

45
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,590
case,
guys would have more power and getting

46
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:26,430
laid.
That's true.

47
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,870
On the girls side of it,
you know,

48
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:30,820
like it's easy for easier for a girl,
it'd be a whole lot easier for a guy if

49
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:33,720
you had so many innocent.
If we all fucking band together,

50
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,170
we can make
this.

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,700
It's to start this right now with the
podcast.

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,980
Podcast is powerful to have a Dick
Union.

53
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,460
Take back your loads.
Save him.

54
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,210
It's important.
Not valued right now in the equation,

55
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:56,220
but dammit,
they should be stopped wasting them.

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,210
It's a key ingredient and making people.
Oh Man.

57
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,780
Without the loads.
You got nothing.

58
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,590
That's the problem though is that would
be like starting a fighters' union.

59
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,640
Like that's not really going to happen,
you know,

60
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:10,960
but just dude's like fuck them.
That's what dudes would say when it

61
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:13,570
comes to the Deq Union.
If we all got together and said,

62
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:14,790
listen,
we're gonna,

63
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,620
we're gonna.
We need to make our dicks more valuable.

64
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:19,540
Okay.
We need to make it harder to get to.

65
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,140
Let's work something out here.
Boys.

66
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,980
The first ones are going to sacrifice
big time and the ones that are starting

67
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:26,260
this thing because now they're the only
ones not getting laid.

68
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,810
You just start this whole trend,
you know,

69
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,070
same as with the fighter union.
You only one not getting paid.

70
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,390
I think you're right though.
It is really tough.

71
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,290
It's hard.
It's easy to say,

72
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,700
oh,
the voters are lazy or whatever they

73
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:38,670
should do,
but honestly,

74
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,230
like you said,
they got real lives to live and I

75
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,130
haven't got time for all this stuff and
that is a really big part of why we want

76
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:45,970
to make it simple.

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,510
You know,
we're assuming that people want to spend

78
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,830
less time doing this stuff,
not more time and I think a lot of the

79
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,900
kind of,
um,

80
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,790
organizations and people that have tried
to get people mobilized,

81
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,010
you know,
civic organization and the kind of

82
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,251
thing,
you know,

83
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:05,680
it's,
it's worked to a certain extent with

84
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,390
some people,
but for the majority of people they just

85
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:09,310
don't want to do it.
They can't do it actually.

86
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,380
There literally too busy with things
that are higher priorities,

87
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:16,900
like their kids and their family and
their job or whatever it may be.

88
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,840
Hobbies doesn't matter.
It's stuff that they choose to do and

89
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:22,240
that's fine.
That's their life and we shouldn't kind

90
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:27,241
of require that you have to spend ages
figuring out this political stuff and

91
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:30,070
that's why we're trying to make it
really simple for people,

92
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,610
but based on quite a lot of compost and
that's what technology allows you to do.

93
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,440
You can take quite a lot of complex data
and information like we're doing with

94
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:42,160
the campaign finance records where it's
literally hundreds of millions of pieces

95
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:47,161
of information and we're boiling it down
into one piece of information which is a

96
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:50,650
score like where is this candidate on
the.

97
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:54,910
On the scale of liberal to conservative,
where do they sit and where are they on

98
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,830
each issue?
That's what we're trying to do to make

99
00:04:56,831 --> 00:05:00,760
it really simple.
Isn't it sort of analogous in a way to

100
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,730
what we were talking about about the
amount of people that you can keep in

101
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:06,760
your brain.
Dunbar's number is that if you lived in

102
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,430
a small tribe,
if safe,

103
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,800
we all live 50 of us together in some
small village somewhere.

104
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,480
We really wouldn't have votes about gay
marriage and we really wouldn't have

105
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:20,980
coats about could be a million different
things that would never be up for vote

106
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,120
and if someone really did start micro
managing everyone's lives,

107
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:25,290
you'd be.

108
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,170
You'd be like,
Hey,

109
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:27,640
you know,
Mike is an asshole.

110
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,650
We got to kick him out of his fucking
tribe.

111
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:32,190
This guy's trying to get people to wear
purple and you know,

112
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,790
where certain Nike's during different
moon cycles and make tribal rules and

113
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,880
rituals and make all these things
standard and you know,

114
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,580
for whatever reason he doesn't like men
sleeping with men.

115
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:44,210
Like he's got some weird thing.
You know,

116
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,350
he believes it's so true.
I just so agree with that.

117
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,760
One of my favorite things that I'm one
of these experiments that was in

118
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,030
Holland,
I think I've got that right in in,

119
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,090
in Europe and they did this brilliant
experiment with traffic where they are

120
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,460
in a town,
I think it was friesland or something

121
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:07,370
like that,
probably got that wrong where they

122
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:09,890
literally took away all the traffic
signals,

123
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,970
all of them,
everything,

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,010
right?
They took away traffic lights.

125
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,890
They even took you stop signs,
everything,

126
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,870
even the,
the markings on the road.

127
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,880
So they took away the white line in the
middle of the road,

128
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:24,881
everything all gone and their theory was
that without that kind of external rule

129
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,320
making and kind of stuff going on to
tell you what to do,

130
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,030
people would have to kind of relate to
each other as other people and just

131
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:38,360
figure it out amongst themselves.
So they would,

132
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,570
um,
you know,

133
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,970
have to look other people in the eye and
sort of work it out between them.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,040
And they found they had this brilliant
effect,

135
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,120
which was the,
um,

136
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,230
accidents felt a zero.
The traffic improve,

137
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:55,100
the traffic speed was lower,
but the traffic flow was much better.

138
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,400
It just worked all around.
All the kinds of things that you try and

139
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,360
do when all these people thinking about
traffic planning and whatever.

140
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,410
They achieved those aims by literally
taking everything away and just allowing

141
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:08,810
people to relate to each other as
humans.

142
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,800
And was.
I thought it was such a great little

143
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:16,610
story and I think that you could do that
in all sorts of areas.

144
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,970
If you just leave it to people to figure
out on a small scale where they can

145
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:22,430
relate to each other,
you just get a much better result.
