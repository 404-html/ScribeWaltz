1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,030
Yeah.
Jamie Tak,

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,200
tak,
who is fat Hashtag.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,010
Did you tweet it?
Yeah,

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,270
Das was,
we're live.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,450
We're live in front of three.
Tony knows pizzas a,

6
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,190
if you're in woodland hills,
California,

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,250
I highly recommend to Nino's get a smell
off of that bitch.

8
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,990
Get a smell off.
I smelled it when I came in.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,510
They're legit as fuck.
Um,

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,420
no affiliation,
no sponsorship to just good pizza.

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,720
All right folks,
this,

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,070
today's Day two,
if you didn't tune into day one,

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,210
Thompson Guerra and Bert Kreischer made
a bet.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,180
The bet is whoever can lose the most
weight,

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,100
uh,
over it was going to be over a three day

16
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,870
challenge.
It's been reduced to a two day

17
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,490
challenge.
Fucking God.

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,900
Yeah.
And uh,

19
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,990
Tom got down from to 67 to two 19,
which is fucking staggering.

20
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:49,350
So how about a nice round of applause
for Tom Yesterday.

21
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:50,310
And how about a round applause?

22
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,930
We're Berg to 21 pretty fucking close
and staggering as well.

23
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,970
Both of you guys.
Amazing job.

24
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:59,070
So today's Day two,
I know you're burnt out.

25
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:01,800
You're dehydrated.
So let's just cut the shit and get right

26
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:04,410
to the way we go.
Right to the fucking way I should weigh

27
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:08,220
in first cause I have a feeling that
don't be scared.

28
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,720
Okay folks,
Jesus.

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,620
Oh,
by the way,

30
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:13,370
we did the height tests,
uh,

31
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,360
because Ari Shaffir who was supposed to
pay if they got below two 27,

32
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,770
are we supposed to pay for their trip?
The loser has to shave their beard and

33
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:27,540
the loser has to pay for the winners
trip of their choice ix.

34
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,560
Unless they can get down to two 27 and
which are,

35
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,270
should fear agreed that he was going to
pay.

36
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,120
But now our is balking and he's saying
that they have to be there.

37
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,840
Their height has to be measured because
the body mass index would indicate that

38
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,090
they have to be a certain height or
they're obese.

39
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:46,380
It was really weird.
So we,

40
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,910
we tested the heights.
Okay.

41
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,530
Um,
uh,

42
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,820
tom is just under six feet tall.
If all you assholes that say I'm five

43
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,350
foot two,
we tested me too.

44
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:57,480
I'm five,
eight and a cunt hair.

45
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,050
Um,
and burt is taller than Tom,

46
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:03,750
so burts good.
You're about six one.

47
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,610
So the body mass index.
I think you dropped dude.

48
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:09,840
You look good.
Get on here.

49
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,370
Get on here.
All right,

50
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:15,720
so bear was at two 21 yesterday.
You look significantly thinner today.

51
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,670
Hurting.
He's hurting.

52
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,110
Let's see,
he's getting on the scale.

53
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,490
Two 2120 for burt for one pound.
One pound less.

54
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:31,640
One fucking pound.
I think Tommy's got it here.

55
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:32,840
Let's say here.
Fuck.

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,900
Say Goodbye to my beard.
Say Goodbye to Hollywood on me.

57
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,130
He's going to Paris for a soccer game.
Please have gained weight.

58
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,190
Okay,

59
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,190
you fucking do 16 tom gets it running
away.

60
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:53,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner in that Hashtag.

61
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,550
Who is fat contest?
The winner is Thompson girl down to 216

62
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,120
fucking pounds.
Outrageous,

63
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,410
outrageous coconut waters.
C Two oh coconut waters must be consumed

64
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:10,780
now,
get those electrolytes in your system,

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,090
boys.
Well done,

66
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,830
well done.
Amazing effort.

67
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,000
It's not easy to lose weight.
It's really not easy to lose it the way

68
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:20,410
you guys did it.
Two days in a row,

69
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,660
man.
Crazy shit.

70
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,480
That was the today was the hardest
workout I've ever had.

71
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:28,180
A rent eight miles last one fucking
pounds.

72
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,480
That's crazy.
I think my body was like in shock.

73
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,490
That's what happens.
That's what happens to fighters.

74
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,660
It,
it shuts down.

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,150
So have a seat,
guys pulled it off.

76
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,520
I've been thinking about that.
Drink this entire fucking day.

77
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,930
Beard,
you've got a beard trimmer over there

78
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:49,330
and charge it up.
Should probably a shave your beard after

79
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:53,140
you have some pizza.
I mean have a live a little,

80
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,540
I mean I have a hard time eating pizza
with his fat fucking face.

81
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,950
It's not going to look good.
How do you flow?

82
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,940
Wait man.
Got So fat.

83
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,190
Yeah.
You look pretty fucking skinny today

84
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:03,880
man.
You did.

85
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,880
You do look significantly skinner
Youtube skinnier today.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,190
I don't know man.
I think you a little distended

87
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,900
yesterday.
Would that pulled pork and your stomach

88
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,340
from the night before?
The night before the weigh ins.

89
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,170
Collard Greens,
pulled pork.

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,780
I wanted though.
Seriously?

91
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,530
What is that long strand DNA strand DNA.
That Mickey Mantle James,

92
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,900
you got that Mickey Mantle.
Geez.

93
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,520
I gotta be honest with you.
Derek jeter.

94
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,800
You showed a little mickey mantle today.
How did you get down to two 16?

95
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,050
What did you do different?
You want to,

96
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,550
it's so funny.
You lost three.

97
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,970
He said something in passing and that's
what I did.

98
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,980
What?
But I just didn't acknowledge it.

99
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,293
He goes,
uh,

100
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,400
she go to Burke Williams and just sweat
it out in the spa.

101
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,960
That's what I've been doing for two
days.

102
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,130
I put abilene all over my body.
That's good.

103
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,770
And then I just sat in the steam room
yesterday and today.

104
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,270
Good move.
Yup.

105
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,150
Run in fucking 10 miles.
So you didn't,

106
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,770
uh,
you didn't drink any water?

107
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:03,604
Nothing.
No.

108
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,660
I did hot bath last night.
I did a two and a half mile track last

109
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,380
night.

110
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,130
Then I did what I'm saying,
like that's what I built up a sweat

111
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:16,540
doing that.
Then I recovered no water then hot bath,

112
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,580
abilene everywhere.
No water at all.

113
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:21,610
Not even a little sick.
I took a sip before bed.

114
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,310
I said after the hot bath,
Jesus Christ.

115
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,610
But I've also had nothing but distilled
water for about six days.

116
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,110
What's the benefits of the distilled
water?

117
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,320
Because minerals,
it goes right through your body.

118
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,220
It's easier to sweat out it that your
body doesn't like to retain it.

119
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,250
Apparently a lot of fighters do that
before they still cut weight to laugh my

120
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:44,440
ass off at seeing burt walk into the
spot this morning.

121
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:45,920
I was,
I was waiting for it to,

122
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,100
he said it.
I was like,

123
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,470
I reserved spot time at Burke Williams
at in Sherman oaks both days.

124
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,030
I was like,
you know what is better for me to work

125
00:05:59,031 --> 00:05:59,450
it out?

126
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,470
Like I was like,
I'll be healthy.

127
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:03,830
I'll work it out and I'll sweat it out
and then like mile five I stopped

128
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:04,740
sweating.
Well,

129
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,950
was the thing about this whole working
it out stuff?

130
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,980
You're not losing any fat over the next
day.

131
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,280
You know,
like it's,

132
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:14,770
it's really just dehydration and you
might be,

133
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,650
might've been better off just sweating
it out then running and I hit my

134
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:19,980
baseline.
I mean,

135
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,550
I wasn't doing this week leading up to
it.

136
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:26,840
I just did right night before wanes.
So or morning before,

137
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,501
you know.
Yeah.

138
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:28,730
That's the way to do it.
What'd you get?

139
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,020
What'd you,
did you weigh yourself when you got

140
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,120
before when you got to Burke Williams?
No,

141
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:34,850
they didn't have a scale there.
Oh Fuck No.

142
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:37,610
But I weighed myself.
When I think about scale at a spa,

143
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,680
I dunno.
I would've definitely weighed myself

144
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,010
there and then I knew what I knew,
what I knew,

145
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:44,540
what I weighed when I woke up yesterday.

146
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,430
And then I knew what I weighed here and
I knew that what I had done to cut that

147
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:50,070
way.
Wow.

148
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,560
I just kind of repeat it.
There was no way.

149
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,430
Well,
I'll tell you right now,

150
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:53,090
there's,
I,

151
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,390
I feel,
I feel like I was bested all around

152
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:58,130
because there's no way I could've gotten
to two.

153
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,530
I would have had gotten two to 14 to
win.

154
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,180
Yeah,
I couldn't,

155
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,240
I couldn't have done that.
He would have to go below that because

156
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,700
you would add to lose by more than two
pounds.

157
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,770
You had to lose more than two pounds
because he beat you.

158
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:13,010
But two pounds yesterday.
So it would have to be like more than

159
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:13,330
that.
Well,

160
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,030
it's clear now cause you won both.
There's no mercy.

161
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,180
I feel embarrassed.
I feel like a chat.

162
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,460
I want to give a shout out to God
without him and nothing's,

163
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,630
none of this is possible.
And then,

164
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,050
uh,
uh,

165
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,720
Jake Smith.
Thank you.

166
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:27,920
Jake was jake,

167
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,790
he's a fighter who gave me all this
insight on ah,

168
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,320
oh cool.
Jake's

169
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,010
go fuck.
[inaudible]

170
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,670
shout out to its anybody.
Oh my God.

171
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:45,050
Can you do this?
Do you want your whole one Roni or do

172
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:47,210
you want Pepperoni and mushrooms?
All right,

173
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:48,680
get in there boys.
Get in there.

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,890
Jesus Christ.
Tomi think you'd hadn't eaten in two

175
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:55,450
days.
I'll see you guys hadn't eaten well.

176
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,840
Tommy
has been eating clean for a long ass

177
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:01,340
fucking time.
Not just two days.

178
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,520
Fucking get us some a,
yeah,

179
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:07,250
there you go.
You know Jamie on the paper towels.

180
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,800
This is some legit pizza to bundling.
Oh fuck.

181
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,130
Hmm.
Hmm hmm.

182
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,340
There's one of the rare times I think
it's okay to eat peach into the

183
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:24,341
microphone because
people need to appreciate the sacrifice

184
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:27,470
that you two went through as I eat pizza
there.

185
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,720
The,
the last few hours were really the

186
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:30,650
fucking worst.
Ma'Am.

187
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,700
Really?
Look,

188
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,500
I mean from waking up,
I got up at,

189
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,360
first of all,
I woke up with cramps at three 30 bad

190
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,610
leg behind the knee here on the outside
and then it will calf cramp.

191
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,090
That kept me up for like 40 minutes.
I considered like,

192
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,070
you know,
you start thinking about maybe I should

193
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,750
drink some water and dehydration clamp.
Yeah.

194
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,600
You think,
you know you could drag a whole one of

195
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,190
these and you still would've won by
three pounds.

196
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,610
Well I didn't even,
you probably good,

197
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:01,140
right?
Four of them and still one.

198
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,720
I was just like,
fuck.

199
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,910
And then you go.
And then I was just counting down the

200
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,050
hours.
So I spent the,

201
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,200
you know,
I get my son with Christina,

202
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:12,300
we spend time with them,
do a breakfast.

203
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,970
I'd look at,
it'd be like seven 30 and I was like,

204
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:19,290
Oh fuck eight 39 30 just counting it
down man.

205
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,940
And then in that,
in that spa,

206
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,310
sweating out,
doing like 10 minutes in,

207
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:26,490
five minutes out of 10 minutes in,
five minutes out every time.

208
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,370
And then I'm in there alone and the
attendant comes in with a big classical,

209
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,670
he,
I thought you might want a glass of

210
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,150
water,
and he handed me a cold glass of water.

211
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,840
Motherfucker,
you look like a psycho pouring it out.

212
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,030
Oh well I waited from leaving and I
threw it away.

213
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,990
Like angrily threw it away.
Just pissed that I can't drink it.

214
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,110
Yeah,
it was fucking livid.

215
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,030
And you really get to the place.
Like today on the treadmill,

216
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,070
I was literally chewing ice and spitting
it out into a shirt and I thought,

217
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,430
I know what those people feel like when
they dive deeper in the ocean.

218
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,620
They go,
there's fresh water 10 feet below.

219
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,420
You know?
There's people that lose their minds out

220
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:05,010
to see.
You ever heard of those?

221
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:09,030
People know what they think.
There's freshwater people have people

222
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:10,950
who are stranded at sea.
There's,

223
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,770
you always hear the guy that's like,
he's like jumps in and he's like,

224
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:16,260
guys,
there's freshwater 10 people lo and they

225
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:19,410
dive down below and drink seawater and
die or go crazy.

226
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,110
I know that feeling like I know I don't
know what to that extent,

227
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,600
but man I can,
I could empathize with it on that

228
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:24,900
treadmill.

229
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,640
The day I was like,
I was like,

230
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,900
I just want,
I just want to cheat.

231
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,730
I want water,
I want water so fucking bad.

232
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,250
Can you imagine the mind fuck of being
surrounded by water as far as the eye

233
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:39,450
can see and you're dying of thirst.
I remember,

234
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,820
remember I survived that,
that series.

235
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,480
Yeah man,
it was phenomenals if people haven't

236
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:47,670
seen it,
they did a series where people who are

237
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:52,671
in like extreme life threatening near
death situations and made it like

238
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:56,040
sometimes they were kidnapped,
assaulted,

239
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,590
sometimes they're an accident,
sometimes they're stranded at sea.

240
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,880
And there was one where this guy,
they were stranded off some somewhere in

241
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:07,560
the coast,
some Gulf of Mexico and boat overturns.

242
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,370
And it's just this guy and his buddy.
And he said like,

243
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,310
you know,
he's telling the story and as it

244
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,320
progresses he's seeing his friend kind
of slip away and the friend eventually

245
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,900
drinks ocean water and he's telling him
not to do it,

246
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,350
but he's so far gone.
And then it just accelerates the

247
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:31,200
friend's death and the friend died.
What happens when you drink ocean water?

248
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,360
You go crazy.
Your body craves more water.

249
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,223
It,
you've just,

250
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,440
I think call.
I think it makes you actually go crazy.

251
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,740
Whoa.
I've seen it.

252
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,920
Well,
I think growing up in Florida,

253
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,730
there's,
you always hear stories of the opposite

254
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:43,370
effect.
You,

255
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,000
you,
it doesn't hydrate you.

256
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,410
So I'm crazy that just anybody want more
pizza,

257
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,060
you know,
you do bitch,

258
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,530
get in there.
It's going to Tom,

259
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,710
you already won.
It's one day,

260
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:54,010
but I'm

261
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,843
fat.
You're not.

262
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,760
You lost a lot of weight bird.
He should.

263
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,320
Yeah.
Plus you're an inch taller.

264
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,490
Yeah,
yeah,

265
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,323
yeah,
yeah,

266
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,910
yeah.
You're stupid tall picks buddy.

267
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,570
Sure.
It really is phenomenal.

268
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,850
So how do we shame Ari if he decides to
Welch out on this bet he will.

269
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,020
He's going,
he's going to,

270
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,040
I think so,
mom.

271
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,790
I'm just going to stay right now that
I'm paying for it.

272
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,500
Whatever.
Um,

273
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,010
whatever the cost is for the trip.
Come on,

274
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,240
man.
I will take care of it.

275
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,680
Well,
you guys were on my podcast,

276
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,310
I feel like,
uh Oh.

277
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,840
And Ari,
he doesn't owe me anything.

278
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,370
Fuck it.
Who gave me some weed?

279
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,040
Dude called me yesterday after the
podcast and an Ra rage.

280
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,580
You're bringing in a ruler tomorrow.
Well we did.

281
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:43,960
We measured them.
We already did.

282
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,520
We filmed it.
We measured it,

283
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:48,250
will upload them later.
He's just under six feet.

284
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,720
You're still,
you're still blow overweight.

285
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,013
Yeah.
Yeah.

286
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,240
Ours crazy.
I gotta be honest with when we started

287
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:57,060
this,
I was concerned about height cause I was

288
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:59,340
like,
I dunno if we're like I don't know what

289
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:00,061
I am.
At the end of the day,

290
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:01,140
I don't know when we're going to measure
me.

291
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:02,790
I know that I'm six one when I go to the
doctor,

292
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,410
but like I don't know what,
you know,

293
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,200
you just get scared and then,
and then that difference and overweight

294
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:10,560
versus obese has like six pounds from
six one to six foot.

295
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,420
It's two 27 to two 20

296
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,940
hmm.
And I was nervous.

297
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,220
That's a big difference.
But either way our,

298
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,550
he's wrong either way.
Even at a just under six feet.

299
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,200
Tom Has a little bit over at five,
five,

300
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:27,220
11 and three quarters,
right?

301
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,720
Yeah.
So it was just under six feet.

302
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,950
Yeah,
just under six feet.

303
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,620
That's a,
I think your body,

304
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,260
I think you'd have to be like two 20 to
be considered over,

305
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:35,950
right,
isn't it?

306
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,140
No more than that,
but is the,

307
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:39,790
uh,
find out young Jamie?

308
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,730
The thing is if you put in five 11,
that's as leaning the other way.

309
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,690
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

310
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:48,070
It doesn't do it.
It's not fair.

311
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:48,904
Okay.
Here it goes.

312
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Does it do it
two 16 and that way you are right.

313
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,600
That's right.
Yeah.

314
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:02,230
You were to 16 so 29.3 is overweight.
Um,

315
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,650
but five 11 it'll say be so,

316
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,801
yeah,
I'm five.

317
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:08,970
Oh,
why?

318
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:11,130
Oh 11.
Oh five 11

319
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,931
obese.
Wow.

320
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:13,660
Well you're like on the cusp.
Yeah.

321
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,550
Wait,
if you were five 11,

322
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,920
you'd still be obese.
Yeah,

323
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,940
two 16 but it's all bullshit,
right?

324
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,774
Because I'm obese.

325
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,130
The,
my point is don't get,

326
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,190
or if you,
if he was being a stickler about this,

327
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,390
you'd have to find out what it is at
five 11.8 to be fair.

328
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,950
Can you type in five 11.8 now,
can you pause?

329
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,670
Can you point in?
Can you put in?

330
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,250
So what do you at what do you at six
feet or you're not obese,

331
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,920
six feet and that's crazy.
That one inch your be ob some one five

332
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:46,950
11 your normal at six 11 you'd be normal
Tom.

333
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,800
So there you go.
Whatever man.

334
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,150
But obviously that body mass index
doesn't count you.

335
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:57,100
You do have a lot of muscle and you do
do a lot of weight lifting and

336
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,780
insurance.
I watched a little bit of a podcast

337
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:00,720
yesterday.
Um,

338
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,390
that's where I'm going.
And Muscle.

339
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,810
Yeah,
I'm losing toenails running shit.

340
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,870
Well if you put muscle on,
the other thing is you lose fat,

341
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,070
your body starts burning it off.
Your body has more calorie requirements.

342
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:15,140
You have,
you have more body mass of more muscle

343
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:16,570
mass.
Um,

344
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,600
so if you actually put more muscle on,
you'll burn off more than you can eat

345
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:21,434
more.

346
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,110
I think I'm going to start doing
crossfit pretty aggressively.

347
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:27,530
I'm really looking for this,
a fresh face look to inspire me to work

348
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:28,200
out too.

349
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,870
Do you ever watch his face look with no
beard,

350
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:31,704
no beard.
Yeah.

351
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,113
Okay.
Here we go.

352
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,580
For the information you entered,
five feet,

353
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:36,780
11.5 inches.
Weight,

354
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:40,200
216 pounds.
Your body mass is 29.7 indicating you're

355
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:43,260
overweight.
So even with an extra one quarter of an

356
00:15:43,261 --> 00:15:46,940
inch against you,
so you're a quarter inch taller than

357
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,813
that.
You win.

358
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,220
So Ari's wrong again.
So Ari,

359
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,070
if you want to be a cheap fuck,
I'm paying for the trip.

360
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,040
You fucking Twat so no it,
they'll pay for it.

361
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,130
I'm gonna let him pay for it now.
He's not gonna.

362
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,770
Let's terrible.
Ari and I are different humans then.

363
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,390
Joe.
Exactly comes.

364
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,960
I can't,
why not too busy?

365
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,060
Come on.
I'm not going to fucking Paris

366
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,100
48 hours.
Yeah,

367
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,650
especially for soccer.
Fuck off.

368
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,020
I wouldn't go to Paris for a UFC fight.
I forget fucking soccer.

369
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,630
What do you get a croissant?
I get that at starbucks right here in

370
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:26,380
good old man.
Come on,

371
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,470
we'll go sit at a cafe and write like
Henry Rollins.

372
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,460
You mock those world traveler people
travel so much.

373
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,870
But I like traveling to,
he was just so dead inside about travel.

374
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,670
He's like,
it's like putting gas in your car.

375
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:42,504
To him.
It's like,

376
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,910
oh great.
Burma.

377
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:51,020
I had a month where I went to Italy
three times back and forth,

378
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:52,470
back and forth,
back and forth.

379
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,320
I was like,
fuck,

380
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,340
I used to,
you still doing tv,

381
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,870
you're still doing any TV shows like
that.

382
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,610
Are you done?

383
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,840
I'm not,
I've never done,

384
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,840
I've never done it.
I've,

385
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,320
I mean my relationship with is always
open.

386
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:04,670
I liked them,
I dig them,

387
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,530
they're cool to me.
They've always been cool to me and

388
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,540
always work for them.
If it's a project that we both

389
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,500
collaborate on and one and we're into,
what I'm done doing right now is,

390
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:14,030
um,
is the kind of stuff where they call it

391
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:15,530
and they're like,
we need you in Hawaii tomorrow.

392
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,620
Cause I was like,
cause that was really messed up my

393
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:22,160
touring and I couldn't really commit to
any dates cause they'd be like,

394
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,650
cause you didn't want to turn it down
and you'd be in New Zealand and they'd

395
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:24,921
be like,
Hey,

396
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:27,860
would you go to Fiji for the,
for this weekend to party with the chef?

397
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,993
And you'd be like,
yeah,

398
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,220
because I was into that.
And they're like,

399
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,670
but Hartford,
they're expecting Hartford.

400
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,900
Come on.
Jackie's got locked.

401
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:36,830
Press lined up in Hartford.
Hartford too,

402
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:38,510
by the way.
Oh Jesus Christ.

403
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,050
Here's some places that I just don't go.
Don't go to Hartford.

404
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,280
By the way,
that's the one thing I should have

405
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:44,900
listened to.
Thompson Uhura Thompson,

406
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,660
garth variables when Tom,
tom and I like it.

407
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,250
I said,
we're at the level in our career.

408
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:53,640
Probably Tom was a,
Tom had told me there's a bunch of

409
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:56,760
places use it should say to go fuck
themselves and he would name them and

410
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:57,331
I'd be like,
oh,

411
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,340
come on man,
that's not a bad place.

412
00:17:59,341 --> 00:17:59,821
And he'd be like,
no,

413
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:02,520
fuck that place.
They suck their GM socks,

414
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:04,430
their manager socks,
they're staff socks,

415
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,720
the co the crowd sock,
the press socks.

416
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:10,590
And I go and I was this company man,
like I remember talking to your wife

417
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,330
about it.
I was such a company man.

418
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,500
Yeah,
man,

419
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,334
I should've listened.

420
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,560
Yeah.
I'm not a big fan of going to

421
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,540
Connecticut.
I like people in Connecticut,

422
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,960
but I just feel like Connecticut has a
feeling and I'm so sorry if you listen

423
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:22,880
from Connecticut and my,
one of my best friends,

424
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:25,670
Tommy Junior lives in Connecticut.
I Love Connecticut people.

425
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,830
Yeah.
Pool player friend.

426
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,310
But the bottom line is Connecticut is
filled with despair.

427
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,930
It's not a real state.
It's a highway between New York and

428
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:36,950
Boston.
You know,

429
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:39,740
it's a highway.
You guys put houses on a highway.

430
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,810
This is what it is.
It's a highway.

431
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,550
And then along the highway it's a bunch
of fucking tax sheltering cunts that uh,

432
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:50,950
that live in Manhattan and then have
these palatial estates in Greenwich,

433
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,420
Kenneth Young,
Jamie digging in on that pizza can't

434
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:54,550
help themselves.
They'll get it.

435
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,380
It's so good.
We only cracked the top pizza too.

436
00:18:57,381 --> 00:19:00,470
We've got two more below that age.
And one of them is mushrooms.

437
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,580
Oh yeah,
baby.

438
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,460
What are you trying to stick to?
Oh,

439
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,110
start drinking then.
Well let's do that.

440
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,450
Yeah,
there's ice.

441
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,970
We got glasses.
Yeah,

442
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:14,330
we got the whole deal and I bring out
the Jack Daniels to young Jamie.

443
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:17,540
We got that.
That's that type of vodka.

444
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,670
What is it that you liked?
Tote.

445
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,180
What does it to dose Tito's

446
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,060
do you have?
Why are you,

447
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,410
what is it about you that is so
confident to tell people to go fuck

448
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:26,550
themselves?
Well,

449
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:29,400
I don't think I tell people to go fuck
themselves to me.

450
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,450
And you like,
you know me,

451
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,310
you know,
you know the conversation we've had a

452
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,310
million times.
What is it about you that makes you go

453
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,880
fuck them?
Like,

454
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,480
do you remember,
do you remember,

455
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:41,970
uh,
that one place in Ohio that you went to

456
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:42,840
and you're just like,
fuck him.

457
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,890
I'll never go there again.
Oh yeah,

458
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,510
yeah,
yeah.

459
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,850
I'm not that guy.
I'm so the guy that you can step all

460
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:49,910
over and then I go,
I go,

461
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,793
Oh,
you know what?

462
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,620
Why don't you think that is though about
me?

463
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,840
Yeah.
Because I've sat,

464
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,690
I've talked shit about people like that
and it always comes back to bite me in

465
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:59,370
the ass.
It always comes back.

466
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:01,260
Like I see them next time and they're
like,

467
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,820
hey man,
it's so good to see you.

468
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:03,810
And I'm like,
fuck,

469
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:04,883
wait.
So that's,

470
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,730
that's why,
that's why I stopped having firm views

471
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:09,570
about things,
about,

472
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,280
especially about clubs.
Cause I was like,

473
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:12,660
it was a bad weekend,
but maybe it was me,

474
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:13,231
Ma,
you know,

475
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:14,610
like I always take the blame on me.
I don't,

476
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:16,550
I don't ever go like,
like you're,

477
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,390
you've always been accurate at doing
that too.

478
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:20,310
Going fuck that club.
Fuck that guy.

479
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,660
Fuck him.
I'll never work with them.

480
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,721
Nimble.
So I,

481
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:25,140
I feel like,
you know,

482
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,700
if I,
if I give like,

483
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:28,770
uh,
if I feel like something sucks,

484
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,630
I feel like I have a pretty good take on
it.

485
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,080
So in the same way,
you know,

486
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,550
I'm not going to be theirs.
We know in comedy there's a lot of

487
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:37,830
irrational people and there's a lot of,
you know,

488
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,260
comedians that are,
that,

489
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,360
you know,
bullshit about everything,

490
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,730
you know,
including how the show went.

491
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:48,590
And so I feel I'm a realist and I have a
pretty good,

492
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,310
no,
you can't do trust my cell phone.

493
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:52,650
You always tell me like you,
you have bad sets.

494
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,390
Yeah.
Like what was that thing in Canada?

495
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:57,600
The thing that went down to Canada.
That's so good.

496
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,540
My winnepeg bombing.
And you played that video,

497
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,580
right?
Or the audio on your podcast?

498
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,470
Yes.
Line was the,

499
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,090
what did the owners say to you when you
got done?

500
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,711
Ah,
fuck,

501
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,060
I don't know.
I got off stage and he goes,

502
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:09,900
oh,
are you gonna sell shorts?

503
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,073
Yeah.

504
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,970
Fucking merge.
How's that Solera this show?

505
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:16,650
Yeah,
saving buddy.

506
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,460
They booed me off stage.
I think you or your take on it was

507
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,900
accurate though,
that it's,

508
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,230
you're a very reasonable person.
So if you like,

509
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,610
that's,
I would say that too,

510
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,360
that if I don't like you,
you're most likely a con deck.

511
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:33,210
Cause I'm really nice.
I'm really nice and I give people a

512
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:35,130
chance and I get along with almost
everybody.

513
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:36,630
Almost everybody.
Do we have any coke,

514
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:39,780
Jamie or diet coke rather?
Either way.

515
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,970
I'll take regular coke.
I mean,

516
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:42,911
yeah,
if you're,

517
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:43,960
if you're,
if I'm like,

518
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,290
fuck that guy.
There's no way he's pretty cool.

519
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,440
And the club,
like if I go fuck that club,

520
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,610
I'm telling you,
man,

521
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,850
I don't do that lightly.
That there's gotta be some real

522
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:56,980
agregious shit on their part to,
to earn that.

523
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:59,470
Maybe that's it.
Maybe that I'm a little bit of a

524
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,120
internal Dick.
No.

525
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:05,410
You know what it is your more of like
between the three of us.

526
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,090
Yeah,
you're definitely more of a people

527
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:10,440
pleaser and mean and,
and,

528
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,800
and that's just like a,
a thing about you and,

529
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:16,780
and it's why people like of the three of
us,

530
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,890
you know,
more people would say like what a fun

531
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,890
time it was hanging with you.
Yeah.

532
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,763
Retards.

533
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,730
Yeah.
Awesome.

534
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:39,130
I don't even know where that came.
So close to [inaudible] guys got a

535
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:47,250
purple bracelet on.
He's got a wristband damage.

536
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,180
Someone who leaves the house and ties up
Bandana on risks.

537
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,630
What are those ones that people put on
their dog?

538
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,030
Fucking me.
Burt.

539
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:03,260
Let me
flip flops on.

540
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,490
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

541
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,271
Yeah.
Well,

542
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:11,350
you know,
you're a real nice guy,

543
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,011
Bert.
You know,

544
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:13,900
and that's why,
I mean you and I've had some

545
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,990
conversations before where you've called
me up and told me that someone was a

546
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:18,820
dick to you or something that went
wrong.

547
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,550
And I get angry because I know what a
nice guy you are.

548
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,460
So when that happens,
I know that guy's a piece of shit.

549
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,840
You know,
we know the one that we were talking

550
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:27,220
about recently,
I was like,

551
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:28,960
well fuck that guy,
cut that guy off.

552
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,360
And I haven't talked to that guy since
that conversation too.

553
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,613
I'm like,
Hey,

554
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,780
this is just,
if you're a mean person for no reasons.

555
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,760
One thing,
if you fucked up something or you did

556
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:42,490
something bad,
but there's a lot of people in this,

557
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,040
in this business and in comedy in
particular that

558
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,640
you don't get,
you don't get the true wire from them.

559
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,160
You don't get the,
it's hard to figure out what exactly

560
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:54,140
went on.
They'll tell you something and then

561
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,440
you've got to throw it through a filter.
That's the worst,

562
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:58,550
right?
Like this guy,

563
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:01,280
this guy was a piece of shit and the
show was going great.

564
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:02,600
And then,
and then he talked to the guy like,

565
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:02,800
no,
no,

566
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,370
no.
He was bombing and he was drunk.

567
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,220
Yeah.
He Shit on the stage is nothing like

568
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,820
the,
the,

569
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,870
the fibbing that goes on in stand up.
I mean there's to get an accurate thing

570
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,330
that you have to know that you have to
trust the source.

571
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,980
Yes.
It's very,

572
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,740
that's why I always been like,
how this your show go.

573
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,970
Okay.
Yeah.

574
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,130
I'm never telling you when it killed.
I don't think I've told anyone I

575
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:24,530
murdered,
but you've told me it went great.

576
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,700
It went great.
You know,

577
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:28,670
there's nothing wrong with saying you
had a great show and actually it wasn't

578
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:29,410
great.
It was great.

579
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

580
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,430
But for me,
but my,

581
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,293
my,
my,

582
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,460
I usually say their officers gentleman.
Cheers.

583
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,990
Hey,
cheers brother.

584
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,670
Hang on one second.
The end of the day.

585
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,100
Yeah.
Thank you.

586
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,220
Thank you.
Thank you.

587
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:40,761
Listen,
you got,

588
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:43,370
you hadn't started fat shaming me.
I wouldn't be healthier today.

589
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,170
Tears and if I wasn't scared that it was
going to backfire horribly,

590
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,900
I wouldn't have done some work too.

591
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,180
That's true.
Sometimes talking shit makes you work

592
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:59,360
harder.
You really were forced into a position

593
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:00,440
where have buddy,
I love you bro.

594
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:01,274
I love you too,
Tommy.

595
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,830
I love both of you guys.
Love you Joe.

596
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,940
I love you too buddy.
All right.

597
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,140
Now I feel the same way though.
Anyone if I feel like if anyone is,

598
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,220
is it Dick Hubbard particularly special
cont because he is such a nice guy and I

599
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:18,650
know people are like,
wait,

600
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,390
didn't you just fat shame him like an
asshole.

601
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,290
But I love him and that was as well in
on it.

602
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,800
That's the best of thing.
Kind of what we talked about yesterday

603
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:29,360
where so many people who are like,
yeah,

604
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,171
fuck bird.
I'm like,

605
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:30,341
no,
no,

606
00:25:30,341 --> 00:25:30,670
no,
no.

607
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,240
You're missing the whole thing.
Everything is by the way,

608
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,840
silliness.
Some particularly mean comments that I

609
00:25:36,841 --> 00:25:40,970
came across don't over the last 24 hours
to run long shore man.

610
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,550
I'm sure I don't even read instagram
anymore.

611
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:44,670
Really?
Yeah,

612
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,720
because the comments are seems so much
more active than anywhere else.

613
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,530
Well if you go to Instagram,
you'll see so many people was blocked

614
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:53,690
accounts.
It's one thing that histogram does that

615
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:56,750
I think.
I really firmly believe that if you have

616
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:59,570
a blocked account,
you shouldn't be able to comment on

617
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:02,480
other people's accounts because all
these people have blocked accounts and

618
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:06,320
then they talk mad shit,
other people's accounts and it's just an

619
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:09,530
anonymity thing because you can't lash
back at them so they can to leave.

620
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:12,080
How many chickens there are just
pussies.

621
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,240
Someone told me to do that very early
on.

622
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,980
They're like,
hey baker account private.

623
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:18,860
That way people,
you'll get more people wanting to follow

624
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:20,180
you.
I was like,

625
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,100
ah,
that's a dummy's idea.

626
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,390
The a,
the whole thing.

627
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:24,740
What they're doing is there's,
look,

628
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:27,080
there's a lot of people that don't want
you looking at pictures of them,

629
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,800
which is fine,
but if those same people will go on

630
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:32,720
other people's accounts and start
shitting on them,

631
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,120
which is what you get a lot.

632
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,810
Yeah.
You get a lot of fake accounts where you

633
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:37,220
going?
They have no posts,

634
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,850
no pictures,
but they're commenting left and right

635
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:43,890
and all these other people and how many
like borderline and even obviously fat

636
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:48,060
guys comments about like,
they're like you're fat fuck.

637
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,180
And you go to like their profile.
Like you're sadder than shit man.

638
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,700
Oh and so is your mother that's in the
photo with you?

639
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,210
Like you're both fat Brennan Schaub was
talking about the other day that he had

640
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:59,880
some guy just post some really nasty
shit about him and he,

641
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,790
and he went to the guy's page and the
guy has a kid and the guy's like holding

642
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,770
his baby up and he's like,
hey dude,

643
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,140
like you're a dad.
Like yeah baby.

644
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,470
Like what are you doing?
Like what kind of example is shedding

645
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,870
what kind of vibes you putting out there
in the universe?

646
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,840
It might eventually bounce back down
onto your daughter.

647
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,790
I've always wondered what comics and I
mean like I could probably guess them

648
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,690
have set up troll accounts to fuck with
other comics.

649
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,220
Oh,
did you know that John Walsh has?

650
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,010
I said,
oh,

651
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,010
but that's Drennan waltzes whole thing.
It's a half,

652
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:33,640
it's fun.
But um,

653
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,320
there was a comic that got busted
recently commenting on his own stuff

654
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,100
about saying,
yeah,

655
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,770
saying how funny he was and you know,
and checkout as homer.

656
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,960
Yeah.
He fucked up on facebook and he forgot

657
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:50,730
he logged in under the his right account
instead of his troll account.

658
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,230
That's beautiful.
Jamie was talking about a of of espn guy

659
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:59,040
that got busted or Fox sports guy that
got busted that got busted doing it.

660
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,803
Bayless.
Yeah.

661
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,310
Oh,
guy's a dummy.

662
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,530
Anyway,
because I saw him,

663
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,350
he was commenting about fighting some
MMA thing.

664
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,570
I'm just like,
is it something about when guys comment

665
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:11,820
on MNA MMA and they don't know what
they're talking about.

666
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,120
It's like me commenting on hockey.
I can't even,

667
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:20,121
ice skate is a weird thing because it
specifically the UFC is that I feel like

668
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:27,321
I can say certifiably,
I was in the Zeit geist when it blew up.

669
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,060
I was,
I was there when it started blowing up.

670
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,110
And even more importantly,
I was doing your podcast when it started

671
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:35,040
blowing up.
Look at this.

672
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,750
Skip,
you are the man,

673
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,030
exclamation point,
exclamation point,

674
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:42,000
exclamation point.
I love the new show on fs.

675
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:44,130
One,
three exclamation points.

676
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,870
And then the first comment is w a t what
is,

677
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,230
it counts that people,
right?

678
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:52,650
What like that?
Yeah,

679
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,800
I love that.
What mean maybe I've seen that.

680
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,190
What mean with the,
no,

681
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,710
no.
The lady that looks like you don't,

682
00:28:59,711 --> 00:29:04,711
I'm talking about and it just says,
I think this is t or Wuut ut use.

683
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,900
I use you to,
that one is my,

684
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,170
this is my,
like one of my favorite Internet for

685
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:11,910
what?
Oh,

686
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:13,820
by the way,
I can't watch hunting shows anymore

687
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,580
because you cause glass,
glass glass on this ridge and I just

688
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:19,380
started laughing.
I'm alone in my house,

689
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:20,610
my wife.
What are you laughing at?

690
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:22,470
I'm like,
do you know what?

691
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,100
Do you know what his podcast is done?
This is very specific,

692
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,540
but do you ever have,
like

693
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,950
when you're made into a meme,
that girl is

694
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:39,450
just look up w h a t or Wu t and it,
it's like a woman,

695
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:42,160
I think.
A kind of vague.

696
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

697
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,120
Huh.
Wow.

698
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,380
That's my favorite one.
Oh my God.

699
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,420
Horrible ones who are doing Ronda Rousey
in 10 years.

700
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,190
Does,
have you seen the Ronda Rousey 10 years

701
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:58,870
ones?
Is that where she's getting hit?

702
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,140
No.
There's a bunch of like really obese,

703
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:04,090
trashy women and one of them was
screaming at,

704
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:07,630
so some kid to get her a lemonade
lemonade,

705
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,450
which is juicy.
The Ronda Rousey radiohead cover.

706
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,301
No,
here.

707
00:30:11,301 --> 00:30:12,340
Here she is right here.

708
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,030
Is that real?
No,

709
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,440
no.
That sounds fake,

710
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:20,921
right?
Yeah,

711
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:22,060
it's face.
Seems fake.

712
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,790
There's a picture of Ronda rousey
getting knocked out and then the radio

713
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,320
head cover and they look identical.
Can you pull it up to me?

714
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,000
Rough Times.
Rough Times in the house of browsing.

715
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,130
I've never been that down in my life.
I don't know how down that she feels by,

716
00:30:38,131 --> 00:30:40,230
I didn't down salad days,
man.

717
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,460
Well,
it's a thing when you're fighting is a

718
00:30:44,461 --> 00:30:47,130
different thing,
like losing a basketball game.

719
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,780
Oh Wow.
Wow.

720
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,660
But that seems like she's winning there.
That sort of laughing.

721
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,020
That's the radio head one.
That's her winning.

722
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,550
There's one of her getting knocked out
at the same,

723
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,440
there's one right there.
The head kick one.

724
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,460
Oh God,
what's really crazy is how just a year

725
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:07,020
and a couple of months ago,
she was on top of the world.

726
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,650
It's that kind of an adjustment that's
almost impossible for a regular person

727
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:14,370
to comprehend other than death or a loss
like that.

728
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:19,950
It was a very few events in your life or
your life will completely shift upside

729
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:21,840
down.
But even in death,

730
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,020
like if you,
if someone you close,

731
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,400
you're close to that you care about
dies,

732
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:30,030
other people are sympathetic and they
care about you and they don't treat you

733
00:31:30,031 --> 00:31:32,070
like you're a piece of shit because
someone died,

734
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,390
right?
So in a lot of ways,

735
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,450
fighting is its own completely unique
kind of,

736
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,600
excuse me,
kind of loss because it's,

737
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,980
it's the only time where people openly
mock you for your loss.

738
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,210
Never seen people though openly mock
someone as much as they seem like

739
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,410
they're mocking Rhonda

740
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,890
in their defense,
in the people that are mocking.

741
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:56,110
First of all,
she had,

742
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,140
she did a lot of things that invited
this,

743
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,360
like the,
uh,

744
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,920
if you ever watch the ultimate fighter
with her and Misha Tate,

745
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,821
like,
you know,

746
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:08,070
she was ridiculous and like sticking the
finger at me should take it.

747
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,690
And after the fight she wouldn't shake
me should tate's hand.

748
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:15,190
And there was like a lot of non sport
anti sportsmanship,

749
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,980
like she do that on the home fight.
Also not touch gloves.

750
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:18,940
Wasn't that hurt,
didn't it?

751
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,010
Yes,
at the center.

752
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,070
Yes.
Yes.

753
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,080
She touched gloves in this fight.
Oh,

754
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,700
she touched gloves at the beginning and
the,

755
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:27,400
but she didn't touch gloves before the
fight actually started.

756
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:30,160
She touched gloves at the stare down,
which I thought was like,

757
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,240
wow,
that's interesting.

758
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,850
And maybe her head's in a good place.
And then,

759
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,340
uh,
she didn't touch gloves afterwards.

760
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,080
But um,
do think that the world will turn on the

761
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,630
conor mcgregor when he loses for the,
they did.

762
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,310
The world turned on him when he did,
but,

763
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,630
but the world respected him in a massive
way because he jumped right back into

764
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:50,150
the fray and then he won.
And he also was fighting that way,

765
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,740
way different weight,
right.

766
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,720
He was,
he was fighting in a different way,

767
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,410
but everybody keeps chiming in on this,
including the UFC.

768
00:32:56,411 --> 00:32:57,290
Or they say that,
you know,

769
00:32:57,291 --> 00:33:02,291
nate's a one 70 bull shit.
Nate Diaz fought one 70 twice in the UFC

770
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,380
against dumb young Kim and against a Roy
McDonald and both times he was too small

771
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:12,560
and got ragdolled.
He's not a one 70 the reason why he's

772
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:17,561
not a one 70 is he's been fighting at
one 55 successfully his whole career and

773
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:19,520
it's fight before the conor mcgregor
fight,

774
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,060
he fought.

775
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,180
Michael Johnson had one 55 it looked
fantastic.

776
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:26,870
Nate is a 155 pound fighter.
That's what he,

777
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:30,800
that's those weight class connors.
Right now the champion won 55 but

778
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,090
they're different in size in that connor
can make one 45 nate eight can't make

779
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:38,580
one 45 so connor can dehydrate himself
down another 10 pounds.

780
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:40,580
Nate camp,
it's insane.

781
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,300
He probably can't anymore cause is put
on a little bit of bulk and now he's

782
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:47,360
fighting at one 55 I'm sure he feels
much more comfortable and healthy there.

783
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,460
He doesn't want to go down to one 45
again,

784
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,850
but nate is almost physically incapable.
I mean he would have to look like he's

785
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:53,690
on death's door.

786
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:59,060
Brutal by the way.
And I can't emphasize how horrible the

787
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:02,690
last couple of days have been and I mean
this is obviously a modified version,

788
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:05,000
like we're not pros but don't really
know

789
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,600
way better.
Both of you do then a lot of guys do

790
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:11,120
when they weigh in.
So whatever you drained out of your body

791
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:12,620
that was so hard is nothing.

792
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,503
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah,

793
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,520
that's what I'm saying.
I peed in the shower and it was like

794
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:16,470
motor oil.
Yeah.

795
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,280
Oh really?
It was dude,

796
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:20,980
it was orange.
It was orange and there was just like,

797
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,200
like it's like my dick spit chewing
tobacco.

798
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,690
It was,
I was like a meme right there,

799
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:30,400
this supporting this morning and I went,
I cannot wait to get fluid in my body

800
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,430
and my,
my dick go fantasize about it.

801
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:35,440
To your mind really starts playing
tricks on you.

802
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:40,030
It's the fucking crazy thing.
That cris cyborg weight loss thing

803
00:34:40,031 --> 00:34:41,860
again.
Yeah,

804
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:44,260
that was a horrible one.
And that one,

805
00:34:44,261 --> 00:34:47,250
um,
espn covered pretty extensively by the

806
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,130
way.
Outside the lines,

807
00:34:48,131 --> 00:34:52,570
back to the skip bayless nonsense about,
that's one of the things I think about.

808
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:57,130
Like one time I asked you like,
how do you fucking know so much about

809
00:34:57,131 --> 00:35:00,700
this mma stuff and you go see only thing
occupying that space.

810
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,370
In my head it's the only sport I follow.
Right.

811
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,710
That's I think the great flaw of being
the all sport comment or oh you guys

812
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:10,450
are,
is that they're trying to keep up with

813
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:13,900
experts,
experts in all the sports and they just

814
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:18,070
don't have the,
like he might have a great take on maybe

815
00:35:18,071 --> 00:35:21,970
in the NBA or something,
but then it starts to dilute somewhere.

816
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,750
You're not also going to be the best at
commenting on horse racing,

817
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,160
baseball,
football,

818
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:28,990
college football,
college basketball,

819
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,240
tennis,
got like people.

820
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,700
So then you're going to,
something's going to get lazy about the

821
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:35,080
way you comment on just

822
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,980
even something's going to get lazy.
There's no room.

823
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,750
Like here,
here's a perfect example.

824
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:44,700
I'm an expert in mma,
but in mma I defer to other people about

825
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:47,580
certain aspects of them.
Like if I want to talk about Jujitsu,

826
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,920
I talked to Eddie,
I talked to Eddie Bravo.

827
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,911
I say,
okay,

828
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:52,800
well like we had a conversation the
other day about a,

829
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:56,250
the Anderson Silva chell Sunday fight
and I incorrectly remembered it and

830
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:58,400
Eddie corrected me and we watched the
submission.

831
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,243
I'm like,
you're right,

832
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,630
you're right.
I remembered it wrong.

833
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,870
Yeah,
I mean I understand setups and I

834
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:08,670
understand technique and I'm a black
belt in Jujitsu under him and under John

835
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,090
Jacques Machado,
Geeky and Nogi and still my knowledge is

836
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:14,840
nothing compared to Eddie Bradley and
his,

837
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,100
his is like almost just like a gift to,
right.

838
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,023
No,
I mean he said,

839
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,520
well,
he's studied it his whole fucking life.

840
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,330
He's a wizard at it.
Eddie's a true jujitsu genius.

841
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,040
He's not just really good at techniques.
He's invented a bunch of setups and a

842
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:33,360
bunch of different pathways to
techniques that worldclass professionals

843
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:36,180
use and when he,
I mean when he watches it,

844
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,490
he definitely sees something.
They might see a hair or two past what I

845
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:45,270
see,
which is gigantic in fighting and so

846
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:48,000
then when it comes to Moitai,
I,

847
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,190
I know a lot about Moitai,
but I defer to like guys like mark tele

848
00:36:52,191 --> 00:36:54,180
grata or Duke roufus.
I'll,

849
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:57,870
I'll ask them and they'll give me a
certain take on things that maybe is

850
00:36:57,871 --> 00:37:00,300
different than than,
than my perspective.

851
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,930
This is like,
there's no way one person can understand

852
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,440
everything better than anybody else.
There's too much to know.

853
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,840
There's too much.
Even if you've got a guy who's an

854
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:13,140
overall like mighty mouse,
Demetrius Johnson,

855
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:15,150
who I think is the best fighter ever.
I mean,

856
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:17,340
I think if you look at his technique,
I think he's the best fighter ever.

857
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,530
There's guys that are better at Moy Thai
than him.

858
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,930
There's guys that are better Jiu Jitsu
than,

859
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,740
yeah,
he's just the best at putting it

860
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,310
together in his weight class and
dominating his,

861
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,630
his division.
But still there's gay,

862
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,970
there's,
it's too big of an ocean.

863
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,330
Well,
that's what I was saying that verbally,

864
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,380
very beginning of this conversation was,
I feel like both of us were probably

865
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:37,960
here in this podcast during this podcast
when,

866
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,850
when you have see signed the deal with
Fox,

867
00:37:39,851 --> 00:37:42,130
which was I think the big blow up where
it was like,

868
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,280
now all of a sudden Fox was going to
brand it with,

869
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:50,310
with sports talent hosts.
And it was not just you and Goldberg.

870
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,431
It was,
it was,

871
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:52,230
uh,
it was,

872
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,841
it was,
it was like,

873
00:37:52,841 --> 00:37:56,690
I remember hearing about big fucking Fox
events where they had it all there.

874
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,570
Jim Rome was going to comment on it or
no,

875
00:37:58,571 --> 00:37:59,530
I'm not,
I'm just saying.

876
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,300
Right.
And that's what kind of socks because I

877
00:38:01,301 --> 00:38:02,134
was like,
I was like,

878
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,330
I feel like,
you know,

879
00:38:04,331 --> 00:38:09,040
I feel like the mainstream media was so
against it for so long that finally when

880
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,500
it pushed through to watch the
mainstream media do this,

881
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:15,130
like almost like fucking arms wide open
like that.

882
00:38:15,131 --> 00:38:16,420
We've always been lucky.
Skip,

883
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,770
give us your insight about,
yeah,

884
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:18,850
it's,
it's just UFC.

885
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,840
It's gift.
Give us your insight.

886
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,510
It's such a complex,
it's not just putting a ball through a

887
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:22,850
hoop.

888
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:26,870
It's so lame when a Gig that is though,
cause the Gig that he has is this thing.

889
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,900
That's where it's like what's your hot
take on this?

890
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,080
And then those guys have to say
something almost that is somewhat

891
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:35,943
controversial

892
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,180
for a tribe.
Yeah.

893
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,260
It's very contrived.
It's like,

894
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,780
it's like,
you know what Joe,

895
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:45,520
I disagree.
Nate is a better one 70 I've seen it and

896
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:46,780
that,
that's just what I think.

897
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:51,160
And then that's like the take is that he
disagrees with you.

898
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,650
It seems like that's everyone.
Like,

899
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,150
I'm not like I'm not,
I'm obviously,

900
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,730
I'm not putting Amy Schumer on blast,
but I feel like these days,

901
00:38:57,731 --> 00:39:00,910
Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham,
I don't even know if they have anything

902
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:05,911
to say other than the most aggressive
thing that everyone will react to and

903
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:08,110
then that keeps them famous.
Interesting.

904
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:10,390
It's almost like blowing air under a
feather.

905
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:11,650
It's hot air.
It's like,

906
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,880
it's like,
uh,

907
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,710
kicking the guy out of her show for,
for buying tickets and liking trump,

908
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:18,670
you know,
and then you go,

909
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,900
well,
she didn't kick him out of the show.

910
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,630
She just told him to get off the stage.
No,

911
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,440
she told him I'll leave.
Oh,

912
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,950
she's going to be the guy on stage.
I didn't watch the whole thing.

913
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:27,641
I don't know.
Yeah,

914
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:28,510
she brought the guy on stage,
but it,

915
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:30,190
she said,
if you're not voting for Hillary,

916
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:31,024
lead my show.

917
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:38,330
I think she was saying if you,
bu people were booing her because she

918
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:39,820
was talking shit about trump,
but I'm not,

919
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm not trying to put amy on blast.
I'm just saying like Lena Dunham,

920
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,350
I wish I had been had had an abortion.
She said that she goes,

921
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,140
I wish I had had an abortion so I could
be with all the girls that I'd had

922
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:51,640
abortions.
I could be on your side,

923
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,650
whatever.
Well,

924
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,640
you know,
but she's overweight.

925
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,000
It's probably affecting our brain.
People say things when they're not

926
00:39:58,001 --> 00:39:59,590
healthy.
That's how it,

927
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:01,950
that's how I used to feel.
That's how I used to feel too,

928
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,380
but like it feels like that's,
that's a way to the business.

929
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,720
It's a,
it's like that's the world she's in and

930
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:12,740
whether or not it's conscious or not,
you're,

931
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:16,180
you're sort of playing to those people
and I understand what she's saying,

932
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:17,650
like if she's trying,
look,

933
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:21,010
if they're trying to take away the right
for a woman to have an abortion and

934
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:25,840
she's trying to align herself with those
people and she hasn't had an abortion,

935
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,250
that's a reasonable thing to say.

936
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,920
I'm not crazy.
I'm not disagreeing with what she's

937
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:30,570
saying.
I'm,

938
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,320
I'm,
I'm just pointing out that it seems to

939
00:40:32,321 --> 00:40:35,470
me that the way I was just coupling on
what he said,

940
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:39,880
the way to be in the media these days is
to say the most outrageous things to get

941
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:43,780
the most activity on social media so
that you're still in the public eye.

942
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,810
I think these guys are scrubs.
That's what I think it is.

943
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:50,950
I think that guy's a mental scrub and I
think this kind of way of talking about

944
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,680
sports,
I think it's antiquated and I think it's

945
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:55,800
going to go away.
And I think that people just,

946
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,900
they gravitate towards it because it's
like a,

947
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,360
you know,
it's just gossip news bullshit.

948
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:05,180
So awesome that he wrote to himself like
such a dummy way to go.

949
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,890
Animation Point,
exclamation point.

950
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,020
I should start doing that every day.
Good job,

951
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:11,710
Joe.

952
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,201
Joe,
wait,

953
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:13,900
here I should,
do you know what I should do?

954
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,220
I should do like,
like really subtle insults,

955
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,590
you know,
backhanded compliments.

956
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

957
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,990
It's just the,
I,

958
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,370
that's that same mentality though.
The mentality that makes you write a

959
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:30,380
tweet and like that to yourself.
It's the same mentality.

960
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,680
The backhanded compliment you got from
an exact,

961
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:34,070
we were talking.
Do you remember that?

962
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,641
Yeah.
Oh,

963
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:37,010
it was like,
we want guys that are like not like

964
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,550
really good looking and not super,
super funny but like kind of like middle

965
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:42,200
of the road.
Like we want to talk to you man.

966
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:45,020
We want to be a talent to be
threatening.

967
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,550
Then they offered no show.
We want,

968
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,600
we want you to be the guide that I feel
like me,

969
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:52,960
whatever regular guy I am at a regular
job,

970
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:56,360
I'm better than you stars.
We don't want stars.

971
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,270
We want guys that are accessible.
Not too good looking.

972
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:02,390
Yeah we don't,
we didn't want to host host.

973
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:04,640
We want a guy that it seems like
watching a TV go,

974
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,630
oh I could do that.
And they could like a guy that's not a

975
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:11,300
lot of talent,
a lot of talent all over the place.

976
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,090
Not that good looking overweight.
And I'm like okay,

977
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,890
is this a compliment?
And then like,

978
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:17,690
do you know what I mean?
Like glossy,

979
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,140
nothing shiny.
And I was like focus,

980
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,810
discipline,
easily replaceable.

981
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:27,000
She just takes off during contract
negotiations.

982
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:28,580
So we can just kick you out and then
they'll notice.

983
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,200
It's like,
remember when they are placed the

984
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:31,011
fucking husband?
I'll be,

985
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:32,500
which nobody gave a shit.
Yeah,

986
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,780
that's right.
And they both had the name Darren,

987
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:36,181
right?
No,

988
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:36,441
no,
no,

989
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:37,400
no.
They both had the name.

990
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,130
They're both,
their names were very similar in real

991
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:41,360
life or placed.

992
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:45,200
It was different with that dude got
cocky and they fucking out at him.

993
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,680
Remember when they did that on Roseanne?
There were placed at one of the kids are

994
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:49,514
placed,
the kid,

995
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,190
the older daughter got replaced.
They just got a new daughter and they

996
00:42:55,191 --> 00:42:58,910
made it like little subtle jokes about
her looking different really.

997
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,310
And then they switched her back again.
What were the two dads,

998
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:03,850
dads names and Roseanne Barr doesn't
give him a few blocks.

999
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,553
Okay,
here we go.

1000
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,221
Well,
Bay,

1001
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:12,170
which which debuted did the summer of
1964 was a rating smashed in the word

1002
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:14,210
go.
The very attractive Elizabeth Montgomery

1003
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:18,110
was a cast was cast in the lead.
Samantha the witch and a skiddish young

1004
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:22,340
actress named Dick York was cast as her
mild mannered but hapless husband

1005
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:23,810
Darren.
Okay.

1006
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:26,510
So where's the Dick?
Sergeant,

1007
00:43:26,511 --> 00:43:28,940
sergeant and the sergeant.
So they had the same name?

1008
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:29,460
Yeah.

1009
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,530
So what is the difference?
Dick,

1010
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,360
New York and Dick Sargent,
whether they look like,

1011
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,510
let's go be wished husband's Dick
Sargent,

1012
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,470
you know what a gay awesome steam room
name Dick Sergeant.

1013
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,790
Hey Dick Sargent.
There you go.

1014
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,250
Oh yeah,
the second guy was like a week or

1015
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,890
chinned version of the first guy.
Couldn't stand up for himself.

1016
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,640
When did we do this shave?
We'll do it afterwards.

1017
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,970
We'll do at the end of the show and take
photos.

1018
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,610
What about aunt Viv?
It wasn't that traumatizing to you.

1019
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,440
Who's on Viv?
Fresh Prince.

1020
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,690
I never watched that show.
There was two of them,

1021
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:04,610
man.
I'm talking about bewitched and not know

1022
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:07,820
aunt Viv by the way.
I had a surreal moment with will smith

1023
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,530
when I first moved out to la.
We were in his car and an uncle Phil was

1024
00:44:12,531 --> 00:44:15,110
in the car in front of them and we were
and whose uncle?

1025
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:18,170
Phil,
who was the dad and the younger guy that

1026
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:23,171
he lived with his uncle
and he's a fan and please we'll through

1027
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:27,340
his car in park and was like,
I'm gonna scare the shit out.

1028
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:31,500
Uncle Phil or he said his real name and
he got out and ran up and then la and

1029
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:34,950
then you watch this big man in this
fucking range over going like in the

1030
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:37,830
front seat and then they got out and
they hugged and they talked for like

1031
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:38,664
five minutes.

1032
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,090
Super cool celebrity.
That is so fucking weird.

1033
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,360
Very weird.
Apparently that guy travels everywhere

1034
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:50,940
he flies.
Will Smith brings like a giant box of

1035
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:54,090
books where there's a veracious reader
apparently.

1036
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,010
What do you,
what do you want to give the skeptical?

1037
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:56,670
Hippo.
Look,

1038
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,900
I know you don't believe it.
No.

1039
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,570
Why don't believe anything?
Why?

1040
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,260
Because I believe everyone fucking
concocted own fucking horseshit reality

1041
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:06,810
so that they sell it to the fans.
Never even been to Russia.

1042
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,950
Why do you,
why do you say no?

1043
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,640
No,
I mean like it feeling cynical because

1044
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:12,670
you lost today.
No,

1045
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:14,130
no,
that's not why I'm feeling cynical.

1046
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,000
Dehydration so bad.
Let's have more coconut water.

1047
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:19,260
Hey,
tell you that you wanted to win

1048
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,930
so badly.
Yeah.

1049
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:21,851
Yeah.
It really did.

1050
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:23,710
I really want it to be to beat you in
this.

1051
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,020
I mean,
like more so than,

1052
00:45:26,021 --> 00:45:27,490
than,
than uh,

1053
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,270
I think,
you know,

1054
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:31,120
it reminded me of,
I was never super competitive.

1055
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,220
Like,
you know,

1056
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,330
like I,
I played on sports teams my whole

1057
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,540
adolescence and through high school and
I would,

1058
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,310
you know,
play and compete and everything,

1059
00:45:39,311 --> 00:45:42,100
but I was more competitive with family,
you know,

1060
00:45:42,101 --> 00:45:43,290
and stupid shit,
right?

1061
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,020
Like there's a new video game,
me and my sisters are playing it.

1062
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:51,310
Then I was like fucking laser focused.
And this kind of reminded me of that,

1063
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,700
of being like,
I think it's because we're close that it

1064
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:56,650
reminded me of like a sibling thing
where like,

1065
00:45:56,651 --> 00:45:59,500
I gotta beat fucking Bert at this.
What's our next competition?

1066
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,780
Oh my God.
Burt wants a rematch.

1067
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,690
Yeah.
Does it hurt?

1068
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,910
It doesn't involve fucking water.
I'll tell you that right now.

1069
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,280
But you are the water champ.
He's a weird to not have water while

1070
00:46:09,281 --> 00:46:10,750
you're the water.
Cham man.

1071
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,140
Like my hydration.
There's no explanation.

1072
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,920
There's no explanation for my hydration

1073
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:20,810
explanation for my hydration.
And

1074
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,540
it's like cutting the water was like a
vacation.

1075
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:33,020
Are you Muhammad Ali?
Frustration with my hesitation on my

1076
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:38,860
hydration.
All that Shit,

1077
00:46:38,861 --> 00:46:39,650
man.
Yeah,

1078
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,890
I mean it really was all about a
vacation

1079
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,620
and I did.
I followed that.

1080
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:47,690
What I was told pretty much to a t j
Smith.

1081
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,650
What a Dick.
Where's jake fight?

1082
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,270
Let me look it up.
Yeah,

1083
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:52,830
look,
Jacob [inaudible]

1084
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,840
how important was it to you,
Bert?

1085
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,580
It seems like you were kind of like
throwing in the towel this morning when

1086
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:58,810
you came here.
You're in pain.

1087
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,550
Fucking,
well,

1088
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,390
you did it differently than him.
He did.

1089
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:04,110
He did the long haul.
You do.

1090
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,160
You did the longs tramp.
But did the sprint,

1091
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,540
the long strand.
I did.

1092
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:12,541
Long Strand DNA march.
Do you look back on like the last few

1093
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,120
months?
Fucking I could have tightened this

1094
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:17,410
bitch up.
There's a couple of mistakes.

1095
00:47:17,411 --> 00:47:18,430
I made.
Five and one.

1096
00:47:18,431 --> 00:47:20,500
Jake Smith,
no photo of him.

1097
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:25,330
Uh,
he fights and pri prime fighting eight.

1098
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:29,080
And uh,
so he's fighting it some smaller,

1099
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:30,160
but

1100
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,710
it looks like he's got a good record.
Holla,

1101
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,490
Holla Jake.
But there's a lot of guys out there that

1102
00:47:36,491 --> 00:47:37,540
are good at cutting weight,
man.

1103
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,690
I've seen some dudes eliminate
ridiculous amounts of their body weight.

1104
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,270
There's nobody better than this guy
named glace and t bow who got popped by

1105
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:49,330
Usada.
He got caught with a gang of shit.

1106
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,231
You system.
Yeah.

1107
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:53,680
I think at two or three different banned
substances to get a bunch of tweets

1108
00:47:53,681 --> 00:47:54,850
yesterday that we should,
uh,

1109
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,610
we should be helping,
uh,

1110
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,570
some big name guy to do it.
They're like,

1111
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,130
why don't you help fucking,
what's his name?

1112
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:02,320
Do it.
He must've not cut weight recently.

1113
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,670
Which guy?
Oh by the way,

1114
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:07,120
I can totally see that training for the
fight and not cutting weight and be

1115
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:08,050
like,
ah,

1116
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,750
my bad guys.
Well it does happen,

1117
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,340
but you lose a shitload of money.

1118
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,990
We got,
we got a bunch of them yesterday.

1119
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,180
I can't remember.
Isn't that great board last 30,

1120
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:19,660
perceive one this weekend he was 30% of
his purse cause he was more than three

1121
00:48:19,661 --> 00:48:22,720
pounds over.
So he has to give 30% of his purse to

1122
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:24,730
his opponent,
which is crazy.

1123
00:48:24,731 --> 00:48:25,450
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1124
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,261
When it,
which is crazy.

1125
00:48:26,261 --> 00:48:29,020
And he looked fantastic.
Ray Borg is a super talented guy,

1126
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,290
but that's a a,
that's a big amount of money to give to

1127
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:35,380
your opponent.
But three pounds at flyweight in

1128
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:36,760
particular,
it's a lot.

1129
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,450
We'll heat,
they're fighting at one 25 and Ray Wade

1130
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:43,600
one 28 point something.
There's a lot of missteps.

1131
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:46,690
I made 29 actually cause they gave him a
pound over.

1132
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,440
They give you a pound to fuck with
because it's not a championship fight.

1133
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,690
During a championship fight you have to
wait on the nugget.

1134
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,360
Like if it's one seven you have to wait
one seven you can't wait wants once.

1135
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,970
It's actually exactly,
exactly.

1136
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:03,070
But um,
in a non championship fight you get a

1137
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:07,360
pound play with how often does it,
cause I've been at a number of ways with

1138
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:11,290
you that um,
they have to just lose the underwear to

1139
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:13,240
make weight.
Cause that I've seen that happens.

1140
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:16,990
So that's wet underwear on can two or
something.

1141
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,630
It could weigh very little,
but that's enough.

1142
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,260
It's the tipping amount because a lot of
it is one of those balance scales and

1143
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,090
just it's just a hair,
an ounce,

1144
00:49:25,091 --> 00:49:27,550
whatever it is.
And then sometimes if they,

1145
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,260
if they're still over what you have been
an hour,

1146
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,710
you have it depends on the commission.
It depends on how you mean.

1147
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,580
It really depends.
It depends on where you're at.

1148
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,180
They do different weigh now.
They do early Wayans the Wayans take

1149
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:42,640
place early in the morning now.
The day of the fight.

1150
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah.
The day before the fight day to recoup

1151
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:48,580
after you have to die.

1152
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:53,560
They started doing that after Duk Koo,
Kim [inaudible] and duck,

1153
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:57,190
who kim had this crazy fight.
They changed a few things after that

1154
00:49:57,191 --> 00:49:59,230
fight.
One thing they changed is they stopped

1155
00:49:59,231 --> 00:50:03,460
doing 15 round fights and they brought
them down to 12 rounds and another thing

1156
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:05,470
is they started,
I think that's when they started doing

1157
00:50:05,471 --> 00:50:07,660
Wayne's the day before.
But I could be mistaken.

1158
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,400
Dehydration fucks with your brain.
Yeah.

1159
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:10,840
It fucks with your brain pretty
hardcore.

1160
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,650
Yeah.
It fucks with your ability to move.

1161
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,090
It fucks with the w literally the way
your nervous system,

1162
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:23,470
like your body works sort of.
I mean obviously I'm going to fuck this

1163
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:26,470
up,
but there was a electrical current

1164
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:27,980
through your body that relies

1165
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,180
on water to function at its best.
I felt stumbling today.

1166
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,830
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1167
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,640
Like I definitely felt stumbling on the
treadmill.

1168
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:37,550
I was off for sure.
Your body is not functioning correctly.

1169
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:39,350
You don't,
you boys need some marijuana in your

1170
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:40,490
system.
Oh my God.

1171
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,540
I don't know about that.
Definitely

1172
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:52,670
going through this drinking.
Not enough marijuana.

1173
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,330
You haven't even had pizza already.
Visions go and this'll be good.

1174
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,140
Well,
it's a good anti-inflammatory frogs.

1175
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,033
Oh,
okay.

1176
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,940
Plus it's legal.
Oh yeah.

1177
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:03,260
Very true.
It is legal.

1178
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,550
It's a nice,
yeah,

1179
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:09,080
that's writing sound.
Connor.

1180
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:10,160
Yo,
I go for the green.

1181
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:13,050
I'm Tin Cup.
What's Tin Cup?

1182
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:17,150
He went for the green,
like he just couldn't stop going for the

1183
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:20,270
green.
Today's the first day in a four days

1184
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:22,190
where I haven't felt like I have to shit
myself.

1185
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:27,240
Some super psyched about that.
I had a stomach bug for the last four,

1186
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,670
four or five since Thursday.

1187
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:30,710
I got it.
I noticed it on Thursday.

1188
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,070
Really?
Yeah.

1189
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,560
Yeah,
that Tommy,

1190
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,350
can you think of drag?
You're going to get another drag?

1191
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:39,290
I don't think so.
I sound James High for fucking eight

1192
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:41,870
hours after I had to drag.
That is a crazy,

1193
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,500
there's 24 hours in a day,
bro.

1194
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:44,810
What are you worried about?
What does that sound?

1195
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,940
Probably UFO reports here.
He'll pass it to me.

1196
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,800
Do you guys see the stealth bomber
yesterday?

1197
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,780
No.
Flying over the valley?

1198
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,270
Yeah,
it was [inaudible] 52 stealth bomber

1199
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,180
flying over the valley.
Really?

1200
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,360
And I'm probably losing bad at something
like trump's in office.

1201
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,640
I got into,
I got into,

1202
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:08,840
I got into a b 52 into the Turret
gunner.

1203
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,870
Is that right?
Be 11 I don't know which one it is.

1204
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,810
You know the one that had the little
ball underneath that you had thought of

1205
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,680
that and not,
I'm not sure I got into one of those one

1206
00:52:15,681 --> 00:52:16,250
time.

1207
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,720
Holy Shit.
You want to talk about panic?

1208
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,850
Yeah.
Do you ever fly in one of those?

1209
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:23,540
No.
I flew in an FAA 18 once with the blue

1210
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:25,340
angels.
I had a bit about it.

1211
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:27,890
I did in my act.
It's fucking amazing.

1212
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:28,911
So crate.
Yeah,

1213
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:31,220
we went seven and a half gs.
Oh by God.

1214
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,870
Seven and a half saying,
yeah,

1215
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:35,210
there was some actor before me did five
g's and I'm like,

1216
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:37,280
fuck that pussy.
I going to beat that guy.

1217
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,260
Let's ramp it up.
And so we went,

1218
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,060
we went pretty deep.
What did that feel like?

1219
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:42,860
Insane.
Like a,

1220
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:46,040
an elevator door is closing in on your
brain.

1221
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:49,250
Like you see the darkness coming in from
the left and the right.

1222
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:52,820
Like literally you can see it.
You could see your consciousness closing

1223
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:53,841
really?
Yeah.

1224
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:55,550
And you,
you do a thing called the hooking.

1225
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,010
We hold on to,
there's straps,

1226
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,700
like you're all strapped in and you hold
onto your straps or the pilot would hold

1227
00:53:01,701 --> 00:53:05,870
onto the handle and you go like this.
Oh yeah,

1228
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:06,560
yeah,
yeah.

1229
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:11,290
And you are literally forcing blood into
your brain to stay conscious and just

1230
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:12,980
the pilot through that too.
He has to,

1231
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:13,943
yeah.
Yeah.

1232
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,580
That's crazy that there's something that
the pilot could do that could pass them

1233
00:53:16,581 --> 00:53:16,990
out.
No.

1234
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,650
That's one of the things that I'd have
to go hook,

1235
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,160
hook,
Hook.

1236
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,430
If I did another one,
we were,

1237
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,680
we were fucking,
we were flying maybe,

1238
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:26,040
I dunno

1239
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,650
how,
how far off the ground but pretty low in

1240
00:53:28,651 --> 00:53:33,090
this canyon range.
That somewhere between San Diego and

1241
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:35,040
Arizona.
Is that what it is?

1242
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:37,830
San Diego in Nevada.
What's their Arizona right.

1243
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:39,710
Nevada's up.
Um,

1244
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,720
so it's this really crazy area where
it's all this blue angel test flight.

1245
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,050
It's like where they,
they practice is this air force base out

1246
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:53,530
there and it's where they do their test
Ron's and they drop things like if the

1247
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,250
tests like where they would like drop
bombs I guess.

1248
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:01,490
And you're flying through this like
small mountain range fucking nuts,

1249
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:04,530
man.
And while we're doing it my,

1250
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:09,150
I see the darkness on the left and the
right closing in and I'm trying to stay

1251
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,984
awake.
I'm going

1252
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,110
and I hear the guy in front of me doing
it.

1253
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,003
Oh,
is this a guy?

1254
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:15,570
No,
definitely not.

1255
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,990
Yeah.
What is this champion?

1256
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:21,690
A bunch of people just,
it's like hilarious g force training,

1257
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:24,240
but oh yeah.
This is Eliza.

1258
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,500
Eliza.
In 50 years.

1259
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:30,860
This is a g force hill training though.
This is not a actually being in a plane,

1260
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,900
being in the play.
She forced train.

1261
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,660
That's Bobby Kelly,
chief voice training.

1262
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:40,410
It's Ilan gold.
G4S training is cool.

1263
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,133
Cool.
Bobby.

1264
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:51,200
Yeah.
The thing about the g force training

1265
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:52,880
though is,
you know you're in a simulator,

1266
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,250
you know,
I mean it might be crazy and spinning,

1267
00:54:55,251 --> 00:55:00,080
but you're not flying like you're not,
you can't look down and a hundred yards

1268
00:55:00,081 --> 00:55:02,720
below use a mountain range.
It was nuts,

1269
00:55:02,721 --> 00:55:04,400
man.
This guy was a bad mother fucker.

1270
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:07,070
This pilot,
he took me through this wild ride

1271
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:09,470
through these canyons and I heard him
doing it too.

1272
00:55:09,471 --> 00:55:11,630
He's going to,
so I'm like,

1273
00:55:11,631 --> 00:55:14,630
he's experiencing it too.
Fuck man.

1274
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,610
Dude.
When when they hit turns,

1275
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,200
that's when it's nuts,
man.

1276
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:20,120
It's like,
there's like,

1277
00:55:20,121 --> 00:55:25,121
there's banking turns that they make
where there's so much panic just

1278
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,860
watching it.
The fact that they find spun around in a

1279
00:55:27,861 --> 00:55:29,660
circle,
they fly in tandem.

1280
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,420
How fucking he fucking fly in war.
Like,

1281
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:34,730
look how much you're moving still.
Yeah.

1282
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:38,260
So these guys fly in war like this and
they go,

1283
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,000
yeah,
he's hooking right now.

1284
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,850
That guy's doing that shit right now.
It's nuts bro.

1285
00:55:43,851 --> 00:55:47,720
I'm telling you it is like nothing I've
ever experienced physically and it just

1286
00:55:47,721 --> 00:55:52,721
makes you understand like the weird
demands that you've got these holes,

1287
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:57,410
your body has like a very narrow window
that it can operate in as far as like

1288
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,690
atmosphere,
as far as temperature,

1289
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:02,660
as far as pressure,
all those things are very narrow.

1290
00:56:02,661 --> 00:56:04,820
Like you're very,
we're very vulnerable.

1291
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,640
It's one of the reasons why fighting is
so interesting.

1292
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,310
Like you take apart like this Ronda
Rousey fight for example,

1293
00:56:10,311 --> 00:56:13,970
you take a person that's obviously very
physically strong,

1294
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:17,450
right?
Like of a female cage fighting champion

1295
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,570
and she,
you see her muscles and you see what she

1296
00:56:20,571 --> 00:56:22,100
can do,
throwing people around,

1297
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,440
but you realize even a person it looks
like that is super vulnerable.

1298
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,940
All you have to do is get hit.
Bang.

1299
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:29,530
Somebody hits you badly,
hit you again.

1300
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,940
All of a sudden you're in trouble.
Bang,

1301
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:33,760
they hit you again.
You can't respond and then you get

1302
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:34,900
knocked out.
Like,

1303
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:40,030
as tough as a person might think they
are is like in shape as a person might

1304
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:43,180
think they are.
If you get in one of those Goddamn jets

1305
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:47,710
and you fly at seven and a half g's,
you'd take one some crazy turns and your

1306
00:56:47,711 --> 00:56:51,880
body's literally like giving you got,
you're going to go unconscious from the

1307
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:54,220
pressure.
It's a makes you realize like,

1308
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:55,870
wow,
I'm so frail

1309
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,520
are so frail.
Dude.

1310
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,510
I was,
uh,

1311
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,870
I think I may have told someone about
this.

1312
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:02,860
I'm sure.
I don't know.

1313
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:06,550
My Body's starting to recoup back to old
burt right now with all this once more

1314
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:07,450
coconut water.
No,

1315
00:57:07,451 --> 00:57:07,811
no,
no.

1316
00:57:07,811 --> 00:57:11,650
I even vodka and that was perfect.
I feel really good right now guys.

1317
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:15,700
I'm skinny and big.
Uh,

1318
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,070
when I,
when I went hell of skiing in

1319
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:19,000
Switzerland,
we went up to,

1320
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:21,760
I think we went up to like 10,000 feet,
maybe 7,000 feet.

1321
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,230
And it was,
uh,

1322
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:24,640
in the mountains.
They took us up.

1323
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,470
Helis game drops us off of my dad was
like,

1324
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:28,120
you're going to,
you can get really hurt,

1325
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,790
but you're so confident.
Like you live in this bubble.

1326
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:35,260
Where nothing happens to you,
but up there I couldn't even navigate.

1327
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:39,010
Like I couldn't even traverse the
mountain a little bit to get within the

1328
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:41,890
line that we need to do to ski down.
Like I couldn't even walk through it.

1329
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,710
So was like four foot powder.
So you're literally like,

1330
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,500
like,
I mean it's up to your waist,

1331
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,720
like you're stepping and it's up to your
waist and you're like,

1332
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:50,940
Holy Shit.
Then I,

1333
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,290
I couldn't even get my board on.
Finally,

1334
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:56,200
they helped me get my board on.
We start snowboarding and they're

1335
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:58,070
telling us there's crevasses to the
right.

1336
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,440
It's like,
okay,

1337
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:02,830
stay within five feet from me to the
right to the left and then,

1338
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:03,301
uh,
I don't,

1339
00:58:03,301 --> 00:58:04,120
I'm not good with accent.

1340
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,400
Oh my God,
he's hilarious.

1341
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:10,750
He's like,
what countries is Switzerland?

1342
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,430
Pretty good.
It sounded pretty good.

1343
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:19,230
You got to stay around me by lab.
Did the bride to the Lens Cajun.

1344
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:24,910
I got to put this a beacon on you and
then when you got there begging

1345
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:25,810
on you,
you're all good.

1346
00:58:25,811 --> 00:58:26,860
Okay,
here we go.

1347
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,580
And so we start going and I,
for some reason I can't turn left.

1348
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,730
Like I can still work perfectly fine,
but I can't turn it off.

1349
00:58:33,731 --> 00:58:37,270
There's so much powder.
And I noticed that I'm just floating to

1350
00:58:37,271 --> 00:58:40,960
the right away from his little fucking
marks towards where there could be

1351
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:43,750
avalanches are crevasses.
And I'm like shit.

1352
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,680
And I'm thinking to myself,
this is like real vulnerability,

1353
00:58:47,681 --> 00:58:50,080
like going like I can't,
I can't go lie,

1354
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:53,290
I can't count for some reason it's too
much pattern for me to turn left.

1355
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:57,300
So finally I just fucking cut it and I
start cutting hardcore left.

1356
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:58,090
I go,
okay,

1357
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:01,240
time to go back right now I can't turn
right and I fucking,

1358
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:03,730
I'm facing face forward down the
mountain,

1359
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:06,870
cutting left.
And I see them in front of me am I,

1360
00:59:06,871 --> 00:59:09,880
I catch a nose and I fucking land face
first into the snow,

1361
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:12,100
four feet and I'm under the snow.

1362
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:14,770
I'm gone.
And so I go to push up and as I put my

1363
00:59:14,771 --> 00:59:16,150
arms forward,
they just disappeared.

1364
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:16,961
They just,
nothing,

1365
00:59:16,961 --> 00:59:19,930
they don't touch anything.
They just go into the snow and the no.

1366
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,580
And I'm like,
and I immediately realized my

1367
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:23,810
vulnerability.
I'm like,

1368
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,280
oh my God,
man,

1369
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,930
this is it.
I'm on it.

1370
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:29,060
I'm 10 down.
I'm guessing.

1371
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:30,620
I don't remember the exact type,
900,

1372
00:59:30,621 --> 00:59:35,621
9,000 feet up a mountain and I'm the
last one on this line.

1373
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,990
No one saw me fall.
When will they start looking for me?

1374
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:41,030
When,
what will happen to me within that time.

1375
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:44,240
Like,
and I start fucking panicking like

1376
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:47,900
hardest shit and I'm trying to move and
flip myself at least open to my back and

1377
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:49,050
I can't,
I can't get,

1378
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:52,910
I can't move at all.
And I hear my dad in my head go told you

1379
00:59:52,911 --> 00:59:53,744
you're going to fucking die.

1380
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,820
And I was just like,
I know.

1381
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,430
And I was like freaked out.
And then,

1382
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,830
and then this I was on,
I felt this hand on the backs we all had

1383
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:03,710
like these harnesses on with a beacon.
This hand pull my harness up and he's

1384
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:06,080
like,
you should see or sound guy.

1385
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:10,550
And my sound guy is upside down skis.
Literally.

1386
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:13,550
Like he's doing a handstand in the snow
gear everywhere.

1387
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:15,020
And when they pull him up,
he's like,

1388
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:16,730
fuck this mountain.
Let's get off this fucking mountain

1389
01:00:16,731 --> 01:00:18,350
right now.
It was fucking,

1390
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,191
but you think,
oh,

1391
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:20,540
I'm a great skier.
I could do this.

1392
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:21,910
And then you forget,
you forget

1393
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,720
you though.
You,

1394
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,660
you don't realize your vulnerability
every time you do an adventure thing.

1395
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,340
Yeah.
Anything that's like an adventurous and

1396
01:00:27,341 --> 01:00:28,870
they're like,
especially like when you,

1397
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,890
you realize how much,
like nonchalantly you put your life in

1398
01:00:32,891 --> 01:00:34,650
people's hands and that thing is when
it's,

1399
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:35,860
you know what I mean?
Like you go like,

1400
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,900
oh,
I'm going to pair a sale or something.

1401
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:38,711
And they're like,
oh,

1402
01:00:38,711 --> 01:00:41,140
this place does it.
And then you realize it's just some guy,

1403
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:44,950
you know who fucking hangs out at that
peer.

1404
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:46,960
He is managing,
you know,

1405
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,750
he's managing your life there.
If you get on like a fucking

1406
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:52,870
rollercoaster.
I even think about it in cars sometimes.

1407
01:00:52,871 --> 01:00:55,770
I know like a couple of comics that go,
uh,

1408
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:59,680
I won't let somebody drive me anywhere.
Like I know a couple of guys that are

1409
01:00:59,681 --> 01:01:01,150
like,
no one's allowed to drive me.

1410
01:01:01,151 --> 01:01:01,671
And I'm like,
why?

1411
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:04,230
And they're like,
I'm not letting just some fucking guy to

1412
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,590
drive me.
I won't take,

1413
01:01:05,591 --> 01:01:07,630
what if he's a horrible driver and they
just,

1414
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:11,140
they're like almost panicked about it.
But then sometimes you feel that

1415
01:01:11,141 --> 01:01:13,690
vulnerable.
Like you realize it when you have a fuck

1416
01:01:13,691 --> 01:01:16,060
off guide driving you,
you know,

1417
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,370
like he's like what's that?
And like talking to you and you're like,

1418
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,890
that's the worst when they're looking up
in the rear view at you,

1419
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:22,000
you're like,
please don't.

1420
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:23,580
And if you're going 80 please don't.

1421
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,120
That's Uber X,
right?

1422
01:01:25,121 --> 01:01:25,941
Yeah.
Uber X.

1423
01:01:25,941 --> 01:01:28,520
I got a new box to go to a podcast and
they were like,

1424
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:29,630
we'll send you an uber.
And I was like,

1425
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,460
oh,
I'm just so used to taking the black car

1426
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:33,320
cause that's what I take.
So I'm used to that.

1427
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,080
I don't mind having a black hard
driving,

1428
01:01:35,081 --> 01:01:37,070
cause I feel like the guy,
he's got a show for license on the side

1429
01:01:37,071 --> 01:01:38,500
somewhere,
but like the uber x,

1430
01:01:38,501 --> 01:01:42,110
it was just this fucking Chinese guy who
was like 60 years old in a fucking

1431
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:43,070
civic.
Perfect.

1432
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:43,821
And I was like,
oh,

1433
01:01:43,821 --> 01:01:45,710
this is great.
And he was horrible.

1434
01:01:45,711 --> 01:01:47,030
I was like,
I don't think he learned how to drive in

1435
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:48,350
his country,
let alone this one.

1436
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:51,620
And he is literally,
and I was like,

1437
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,570
how?
How recently had be,

1438
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:54,620
hey,
been in America.

1439
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,230
Uh,
he was not speaking very good English or

1440
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,600
like horrific English.
This is what he sounded like.

1441
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:01,780
Okay.
I'm going to take you up on it.

1442
01:02:01,781 --> 01:02:06,781
Four or five
swaying to the left swinging too there.

1443
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,930
It sounds like Yaakov.
Yaakov.

1444
01:02:11,931 --> 01:02:13,640
Yeah.
I did an interview with the alcove on my

1445
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:14,810
podcast.
Good Dude.

1446
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:16,310
He's a great dude.
He's a good dude.

1447
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:17,131
He's at the comedy store.
Okay.

1448
01:02:17,131 --> 01:02:17,230
All the

1449
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:18,340
time.
It's a very friendly,

1450
01:02:18,341 --> 01:02:19,980
he's like his own right?
Isn't that the thing

1451
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,810
he has sold in Branson,
Missouri,

1452
01:02:21,811 --> 01:02:23,100
right?
I think he got rid of it.

1453
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,130
Did he?
I,

1454
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,880
when I interviewed him,
it was probably a year ago by the way.

1455
01:02:26,881 --> 01:02:30,170
Brands and music is pretty fucking bad
ass and he was getting worse.

1456
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,430
It from Kansas City.
I have no clue.

1457
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,980
He's in,
he's a really nice guy and he's a smart

1458
01:02:34,981 --> 01:02:37,140
guy and he's a good joke writer.
Yeah,

1459
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,650
just the jokes are funny man.
He's just a guy that,

1460
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:41,251
uh,
you know,

1461
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:43,890
came up during a really strange time,
you know.

1462
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,760
All right.
Just texted me.

1463
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,870
What'd he say?
You said you were six.

1464
01:02:46,871 --> 01:02:48,330
One,
you're actually under six feet.

1465
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:50,580
He's mad.
He's mad.

1466
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,160
Yeah.
I wish we had a phone line to patch him

1467
01:02:53,161 --> 01:02:54,660
in.
Let's not do it.

1468
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,090
He'll get mad.
We did it yesterday and it was a

1469
01:02:57,091 --> 01:02:58,740
disaster.
He's angry

1470
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:03,690
a lot.
He's such an interesting friend to have

1471
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:05,850
on the spectrum of friends to have one
of those.

1472
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,880
Yeah.
It's just so I feel like,

1473
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,940
uh,
I'm going to step in as his friend and

1474
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:14,340
pay for this whole thing because you
guys did it on my podcast,

1475
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:17,040
so I want to,
why do you keep saying that?

1476
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,113
Yeah,
just let it go.

1477
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:19,680
All right,
so I'm going to take care of it.

1478
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,750
So Ari,
a,

1479
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:21,690
you're off the hook,
dude.

1480
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:23,440
Sorry.
Just,

1481
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,720
I don't want to seem upset.

1482
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,980
It just gives you a minute.
Well also like it was,

1483
01:03:29,981 --> 01:03:33,120
it might've been his idea,
but honestly I benefited from it more

1484
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:35,610
than anybody cause you guys did it on my
podcast.

1485
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,550
It's been good.
Podcasting and fine.

1486
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,820
It's your first time ever.
We've never done two in a row like this.

1487
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:43,980
Yeah,
I've never done something along these

1488
01:03:43,981 --> 01:03:46,380
lines.
Tom was like called me when he was like,

1489
01:03:46,381 --> 01:03:48,150
we're doing two in a row or you don't
have to carry this.

1490
01:03:48,151 --> 01:03:49,410
I'm not that funny.
And I was like,

1491
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:59,280
I like doing two permeable podcasts.
Let me ask you this before I forget.

1492
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:02,250
Well what,
what could you have done to get yourself

1493
01:04:02,251 --> 01:04:03,850
out of that snow?
Oh,

1494
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:05,920
nothing.
But a lot of people get trapped in the

1495
01:04:05,921 --> 01:04:08,660
snow like that.
Is there a thing you're supposed to do?

1496
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,310
He's supposed to move the snow away from
your face and you have air.

1497
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:14,070
I'm sure there is.
I'm sure you probably should start

1498
01:04:14,071 --> 01:04:16,890
packing snow down and around you.
I don't know.

1499
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:20,610
My camera man,
Kendall is a professional snowboarder

1500
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:24,780
and he um,
he had a very similar experience.

1501
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:27,740
We talked about it that night at a bar
and Switzerland and uh,

1502
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,970
he was telling me,
he was like one time he was flying

1503
01:04:29,971 --> 01:04:31,860
through the,
he was going through the tree lines.

1504
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:34,440
He went in for me to do an accent.
He was going through the tree lines and

1505
01:04:34,441 --> 01:04:37,980
he hit a tree and all the snow that was
in the tree buried him.

1506
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:41,010
Oh my God.
And he was here and he was upside down,

1507
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:42,660
upside down.
And he was in,

1508
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,270
I guess it's called like a tree wells,
people who ski no more,

1509
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:49,290
no more about this than I would,
but apparently what happens is no snow

1510
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:52,560
falls around the tree at all.
And then it's very,

1511
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,410
very light packed snow so you can get
buried in it.

1512
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:57,510
And he was like,
he said he,

1513
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,490
it was,
his back was fucked up but he was trying

1514
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:00,540
to get out and he couldn't get out and
he was like,

1515
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:01,710
Oh shit,
this is how you die.

1516
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,230
I've had,
I've had three friends dice a

1517
01:05:04,231 --> 01:05:06,450
snowboarding,
like three friends,

1518
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:08,190
three friends die,
snowboarding,

1519
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,350
hitting trees and shit.
One hit a tree,

1520
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,660
one skied off a mountain.

1521
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:14,050
Ooh.

1522
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,860
And I saw his wife recently and I was
like,

1523
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,420
and I haven't seen her since he died.
And I was like,

1524
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:21,550
just so you know,
I think about him a lot,

1525
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,620
you know,
cause I think,

1526
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,660
cause I went snowboarding.
When you go snowboarding in Switzerland,

1527
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:28,420
it's above the tree line.
So like where's your definitely cleared?

1528
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,710
Isn't it weird that you're allowed to do
some shit that kills people and nobody

1529
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:33,770
bats an eye?
Yeah.

1530
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:36,190
And everybody looks forward to it,
you know?

1531
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,180
But if you,
if we were going skydiving,

1532
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:41,000
you know,
and like there's,

1533
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,670
or there's a place,
I went skiing in Aspen and uh,

1534
01:05:43,671 --> 01:05:46,430
I went to this place and I was like,
how many people die here and here?

1535
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,970
This dude who lives there,
he goes at least one or two.

1536
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,130
Every year I get one or two every year I
go,

1537
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:53,470
what usually happens?
It goes trees.

1538
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,180
They hit trees,
they flopped.

1539
01:05:55,181 --> 01:05:57,130
They fall off mountains,
they break their necks.

1540
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,030
I go,
really?

1541
01:05:58,030 --> 01:05:58,720
He goes,
yeah,

1542
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,441
yeah,
one or two.

1543
01:05:59,441 --> 01:06:00,940
Every year I'm like,
Whoa,

1544
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:02,400
there's a freak.
Everybody out there.

1545
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:03,700
Like I guest skiing,
so fun.

1546
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:04,534
They just go,
fuck it.

1547
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,990
Yeah,
go think about scuba diving.

1548
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,700
They fly off,
gone.

1549
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:17,350
Hitting the tree is at least probably
really lights out really fast.

1550
01:06:17,351 --> 01:06:20,770
It was watching a video of a,
my friend Aubrey is a really good scare.

1551
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:22,730
He gets skee,
skee,

1552
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:24,070
look,
I can survive,

1553
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,170
but he get,
I've only been skiing for four years,

1554
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:28,400
but he could ski like he gets on his
keys.

1555
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:33,410
He's like any human being who's using
skis these days can really ski like

1556
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:36,070
everyone else.
Everyone my age just snowboarded.

1557
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,870
But if you,
if you're a grown man and you're on

1558
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:39,250
skis,
you know what the fuck you're doing.

1559
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,310
That's not totally true.
I learned skiing.

1560
01:06:42,311 --> 01:06:43,900
I never snowboarded.
Oh really?

1561
01:06:43,901 --> 01:06:45,160
Yeah.
I learned skiing for years ago.

1562
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:47,380
Like here's the Aubrey flying down this
hill.

1563
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,221
Like look,
see,

1564
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:50,650
like you could tell when you look at a
guy like that move,

1565
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:55,180
like who can actually ski and skiing now
that I'm skinny when I'm doing this.

1566
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:55,930
Yeah,
dude,

1567
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:57,490
for sure you'll be doing a lot of
things.

1568
01:06:57,491 --> 01:07:00,730
It's like taking a weight vest off,
but when I'm looking at him scam,

1569
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:04,060
like this is a motherfucker that skis so
smooth.

1570
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,250
Like,
that's a guy's been skiing like a long

1571
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:07,720
time and he really knows what he's
doing.

1572
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:10,690
My skis are always further apart.
I look all goofy.

1573
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:14,470
I'm not that like,
he's really good if you've talking

1574
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:17,170
fucking polls is good.
And he's really good friends with that

1575
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:20,200
Bodie Miller guy who was at world
champion cause interesting guy.

1576
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,030
Fuck yeah.
Yeahs mean to.

1577
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:24,880
I've a good buddy of mine who was on the
US Olympic ski team,

1578
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:26,890
my friend Steve Graham from time we were
kids,

1579
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:29,170
he was a,
he's my friend,

1580
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:30,250
he's an ophthalmologist.

1581
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:32,800
And when uh,
I was a kid,

1582
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:36,910
I was like 15 or 16 I met him whenever
he,

1583
01:07:36,911 --> 01:07:41,560
this guy had at at the time maybe 10
surgeries on his knees,

1584
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:46,090
10 like giant scars up and down his
knees where they used to have to open

1585
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:49,030
them up like the old days when they do
surgery,

1586
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:52,930
they would cut you open like a fish and
just stitch stuff together and hope it

1587
01:07:52,931 --> 01:07:55,390
hung on.
Fuck that.

1588
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,450
But like skiing,
like getting really good like that.

1589
01:07:58,451 --> 01:07:59,980
Like how old were you when you were
learned?

1590
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:05,170
45 shut up.
That's gotta be fucking have eaten shit

1591
01:08:05,171 --> 01:08:06,880
hard skiing before.
Well,

1592
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,080
when I was a kid,
man,

1593
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:12,550
I avoided anything that I thought could
possibly hurt my legs because I was

1594
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:14,890
doing so much taekwondo cause I was,
you know,

1595
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:17,330
so uh,
obsessed with martial arts.

1596
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:18,170
Yeah.
I was like,

1597
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,730
and it's so dangerous has it is I'm
like,

1598
01:08:19,731 --> 01:08:22,550
I'm not taking any extra dangerous.
Like I'm not going to break my leg

1599
01:08:22,551 --> 01:08:26,300
skiing or break my arm on a motorcycle
or get fucked up and that way,

1600
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:28,880
like when I'm already doing this.
So I avoided all that stuff.

1601
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:33,600
But Dad said that to me and we went to a
windy gap who's like a youth camp,

1602
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,430
uh,
with Christian youth camp.

1603
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:37,410
We yet to see Jesus by the end of the
week.

1604
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,880
I saw him,
I met him.

1605
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:39,900
What happened?
The shower.

1606
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:41,970
Whoa.
I had to tell my story to the camp.

1607
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,590
What happened?
They were like,

1608
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,290
you haven't seen Jesus got burt.
Where's Jesus?

1609
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,060
And I was like,
and I had just taken a shower that day

1610
01:08:48,061 --> 01:08:49,740
and I had like a cool moment.
They shower,

1611
01:08:49,741 --> 01:08:51,240
going like being,
feeling grateful for life.

1612
01:08:51,241 --> 01:08:55,050
I was 18 getting ready to go to Florida
state and there were like 18 in this.

1613
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:56,460
I thought you were 11.

1614
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:01,880
That's so funny.
Yeah,

1615
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:05,640
I was 18
I could smoke cigarettes but you

1616
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,530
couldn't smoke there.
And uh,

1617
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,540
and they brought me up in front of camp
and I was like,

1618
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:10,680
they're like,
have you seen Jesus?

1619
01:09:10,681 --> 01:09:13,200
And I was like,
I saw what was being real,

1620
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:16,800
which is I think the PR,
the Predominant Times that I'm funny as

1621
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:18,620
what I'm trying to be sincere.
And I said,

1622
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:20,400
I saw,
I saw him in the shower today and the

1623
01:09:20,401 --> 01:09:21,900
fucking place fell apart and they're
like,

1624
01:09:21,901 --> 01:09:23,400
just sit down.
I was like,

1625
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,070
I did have a cool moment in the shower
where I was grateful.

1626
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,390
Why can't you find why Jesus

1627
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:29,370
when you're naked?
Why does it Jesus has to come?

1628
01:09:29,371 --> 01:09:31,950
When you were in your tie with your
shoes tied,

1629
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,230
you should be able to be aroused and see
why not.

1630
01:09:34,231 --> 01:09:38,760
You should be like about to come and you
see Jesus and you clamp down to your

1631
01:09:38,761 --> 01:09:40,500
Dick.
Like you're trying to choke it to death.

1632
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:44,700
Stop the come from coming out.
So you don't want to be disrespectful,

1633
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:45,810
right?
And then you go,

1634
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:47,250
I love you Jesus.
And then he let it go.

1635
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,500
What if Jesus said it's okay son,
you can come.

1636
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:52,980
They'd be a big time believer when
people are angry.

1637
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,840
Listen to,
was talking about this right now.

1638
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:58,590
Angry cause you're not supposed to be
talking about Jesus and pleasure.

1639
01:09:58,860 --> 01:09:59,730
Yeah.
What if,

1640
01:09:59,731 --> 01:10:02,190
what if Jesus came to you in the middle
of a massage?

1641
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:05,670
You're lying on your stomach.
No sexual organs are involved.

1642
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:09,600
But when someone has like oil on your
end there on your back and they're

1643
01:10:09,601 --> 01:10:13,530
rubbing their elbow across the spine,
just loose and everything,

1644
01:10:13,531 --> 01:10:15,370
I'd be know that feels like,
ah,

1645
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:20,840
arguably there's times where that feels
as good as coming,

1646
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,830
right?
Arguably right?

1647
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:24,780
Like,
but why is that okay?

1648
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:29,220
Cause it's not sexual.
Like what weird rules do we have about

1649
01:10:29,221 --> 01:10:33,240
touching each other where you can lay
down on your stomach and some lady that

1650
01:10:33,241 --> 01:10:38,241
you don't know can rub her back on like
rubber elbow rather deep into your back.

1651
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:42,930
And it feels amazing.
They're rubbing your feet incredible.

1652
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:46,050
Someone rubs your feet.
Oh I feel so good.

1653
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:49,500
But as long as it's not that good,
like Dick good.

1654
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:50,520
Yeah.
Dot.

1655
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:54,120
As long as it's not balls.
Good balls and Dick and balls and Dick,

1656
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:55,120
hey,
hey,

1657
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:55,953
hey,
hey.

1658
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:58,110
Can you rub the ass?
The cheeks?

1659
01:10:58,111 --> 01:10:58,944
Yes.
Yeah.

1660
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,890
And a dangerous massage.
They rubbed your cheeks.

1661
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:03,570
Dangerous.
Oh,

1662
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,820
they're just getting into the gluteus
maximus here.

1663
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,620
Oh,
so I'm gonna say it's not my hip

1664
01:11:07,621 --> 01:11:09,800
flexors.
Don't touch my ass all it's right there.

1665
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:12,130
Don't touch her so close.
Like,

1666
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,020
like fucking danger

1667
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,720
zone three not allowed to talk.
You know,

1668
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,100
why can't they touch our dicks?
It doesn't,

1669
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:22,710
because we grew up like big babies.
We had fucking ridiculous puritans who

1670
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:26,290
got on rafts powered by the wind.
They floated over to some place they

1671
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:29,880
weren't even sure existed.
They set up a bunch of stupid rules and

1672
01:11:29,881 --> 01:11:33,450
the echoes of that stupid rules,
fuck with our dicks and assholes today.

1673
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:34,530
I think they,
you know,

1674
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:35,750
that was the whole,
the whole product,

1675
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:37,400
the whole thing about that.
Uh,

1676
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,220
there was a fucking doctor who was
giving women orgasms and that was his,

1677
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:42,310
his thing.
Yeah.

1678
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,670
Do you know what I'm talking about?
I do.

1679
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:45,211
Yeah.
Yeah.

1680
01:11:45,211 --> 01:11:48,060
There's been a couple stories like that
were doctors start fingering their

1681
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:52,770
patients to like to get them out of a
hysterectomy is like,

1682
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:58,130
well hysterical word,
hysterical comes like that's another

1683
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:02,910
one.
The word hysterical had something to do

1684
01:12:02,911 --> 01:12:06,380
with like hysterectomies didn't it?
Isn't that like the origins of it is

1685
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,080
that they used to,
some doctors used to actually manually

1686
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:12,120
manipulate women to orgasm.
Yeah.

1687
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:16,080
Back in the day there's an the day
before people get scared of vaginas.

1688
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,930
There's a doctor in beverly hills called
Doctor squirts.

1689
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:20,760
Whoa,
that's not a real doctor.

1690
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,680
Stop right now.
Don't use your credit card.

1691
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:33,030
Burn
fact that

1692
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:39,390
that fucking guy decided to go with Dr
Squirts.

1693
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:41,400
But that's what the women call him.
Oh my God.

1694
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:44,610
So my wife said to me,
her friend Sandy,

1695
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:47,520
or like they heard about doctor squirts
and they were talking to me.

1696
01:12:47,521 --> 01:12:48,960
They're like,
is that cheating if we went to doctor

1697
01:12:48,961 --> 01:12:51,060
Squirt,
cause he apparently gives you a massage

1698
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,850
and then gives you an orgasm.
It's like the best orgasm you've ever

1699
01:12:53,851 --> 01:12:56,610
had.
That is so crazy that women are,

1700
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:57,840
but it makes sense.

1701
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:01,570
It's
like if a woman was a check with a,

1702
01:13:01,571 --> 01:13:04,940
a good job and she's busy working and we
have to corporate ladder just now.

1703
01:13:04,941 --> 01:13:07,490
Tom Tate assholes.
But she wants to get finger banged.

1704
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,710
Yeah.
Why couldn't she just do that?

1705
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:10,450
Yeah.
That's uh,

1706
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:12,200
that's in that new movie.
Um,

1707
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:13,251
where is it?
Yeah,

1708
01:13:13,251 --> 01:13:14,600
the,
there's the fuck.

1709
01:13:14,601 --> 01:13:17,570
It's a,
it's like the legal thriller that's out.

1710
01:13:17,571 --> 01:13:19,220
And she's the,
uh,

1711
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:22,190
attorney and she has,
she hires guys to come on.

1712
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,390
Yeah,
she's like busy,

1713
01:13:23,391 --> 01:13:24,140
busy,
busy.

1714
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:25,820
What movies?
Um,

1715
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:27,530
fuck.
What's her name?

1716
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,140
The red head.
Uh,

1717
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,260
I have to look it up,
man.

1718
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:32,600
Miss Miss Sloane,
is that the name of a movie?

1719
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,160
Oh yeah,
I know you're talking about,

1720
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,590
I know it's not about,
it's about gun control.

1721
01:13:37,591 --> 01:13:40,050
She's alive.
She's a lobbyist or a lawyer

1722
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:43,580
for a lobbyist.
And I'm Jessica chastain.

1723
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:46,670
So she plays like this really,
you know,

1724
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,020
high power.
Um,

1725
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:49,100
she,
it's finger banged.

1726
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:51,260
She goes,
she hires dudes to fucker in hotel

1727
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:54,890
rooms.
What did she only has like and she hires

1728
01:13:54,891 --> 01:13:59,150
them for like an hour got in it because
she has all she has is like,

1729
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,980
you know,
was very little free time.

1730
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,180
But anyway,
Liam,

1731
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:05,210
Liam was talking about Dr Squirts.
So do you think it's cheating?

1732
01:14:05,211 --> 01:14:07,450
Would you let your wife go to doctor
squirts guys

1733
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:11,410
get paid to be able to bank checks like
that?

1734
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,160
Yeah,

1735
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,590
like that is in,
in society's eyes.

1736
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:19,450
It's probably a way less looked down
upon then a girl pays for sex.

1737
01:14:19,451 --> 01:14:21,520
Like that guy is actually a stud.
Isn't that odd?

1738
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:24,910
Is I like the guy,
if a guy gets paid to go and fuck a

1739
01:14:24,911 --> 01:14:26,890
girl,
you don't go out of that poor bastards

1740
01:14:26,891 --> 01:14:28,290
being exploited.
Right.

1741
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:28,950
You Go,
what?

1742
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:30,120
He's a stud.
Right.

1743
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:30,640
But if,
uh,

1744
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,070
if it was the reverse and it was a male
lawyer,

1745
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:34,510
right.
With red hair.

1746
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,910
Oh,
you didn't get sex.

1747
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:38,620
Right?
Cause it the beautiful lawyer with red

1748
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:39,820
hair.
Oddly enough,

1749
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:40,740
if it's a woman,
yeah,

1750
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,790
it's extra attractive.
And if it's,

1751
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,610
if it's a man,
it's open season on jokes.

1752
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,720
Right.
Ginger jokes.

1753
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,700
I don't get it.
I don't know what the fuck's going on

1754
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:51,100
with that red hair discrimination we
have in this country.

1755
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:52,240
It's prevalent here.
Yeah,

1756
01:14:52,241 --> 01:14:57,241
it's a pretty strong,
but if a guy was a male lawyer with red

1757
01:14:57,611 --> 01:14:59,560
hair,
decided to get a prostitute,

1758
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,900
we feel bad for the hooker.
Right.

1759
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:05,140
This poor girl,
she's just gone down a pat road,

1760
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:08,920
but meanwhile,
this dude with a leather belt around his

1761
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:09,990
dick,
you know that's,

1762
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,430
yeah.
Strolling into town.

1763
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,451
He's just like,
yeah,

1764
01:15:13,451 --> 01:15:15,580
he's like a swinging Dick.
He's just a Dick slinger.

1765
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:16,391
Yeah,
I know.

1766
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:17,560
Weird.
And getting paid.

1767
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,390
Paid.
How many of those are there?

1768
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,400
I remember that was like American
Gigolo.

1769
01:15:21,401 --> 01:15:23,190
Richard Gere.
Fuck Outta here.

1770
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:25,390
Yeah.
Magic Mike about Gigolos too.

1771
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,393
Yeah,
there were.

1772
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:28,320
There were strippers.
I don't know if they were fucking girls,

1773
01:15:28,321 --> 01:15:30,630
but I'm sure they were.
Then there was that Gigolos show.

1774
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:33,120
There was a Gigolo show.
Wait,

1775
01:15:33,121 --> 01:15:34,130
what was the guy?
Yeah.

1776
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:36,780
Yeah,
man was followed around.

1777
01:15:36,781 --> 01:15:37,860
Real ones.
Oh my God.

1778
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:39,870
It's amazing.
You've never seen Gigolos.

1779
01:15:39,871 --> 01:15:42,720
No.
I always learned about awesome things

1780
01:15:42,721 --> 01:15:45,060
from you.
That's all he fucking does.

1781
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:47,970
I thought about it last night.
I was like,

1782
01:15:47,971 --> 01:15:49,570
you know,
I'd never heard of Diane at word and

1783
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:51,600
before him,
they're the best ob.

1784
01:15:51,601 --> 01:15:55,080
He was talking about Diane word when I
Ella was born like you were talking

1785
01:15:55,081 --> 01:15:58,260
about it in 2006.
It talks about what Shit Diane word.

1786
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,090
You don't even have to send the member
then.

1787
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:00,881
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1788
01:16:00,881 --> 01:16:01,710
yeah,
yeah.

1789
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:03,330
Those guys are the shit.
I love that.

1790
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:05,580
And you were like,
what is this?

1791
01:16:05,581 --> 01:16:08,560
And then I watched it and then became
obsessed with Yolanda foster.

1792
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,100
Oh,
they're both amazing.

1793
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:15,530
Gigolos
nick hawks in bag on the other end.

1794
01:16:16,551 --> 01:16:18,340
The far right.
The guy in the far right to rapper.

1795
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:21,790
Who in bag know?
So Jay,

1796
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,790
you know their names.
Oh my God.

1797
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:25,830
Tommy buttons.
I mean there's brakes.

1798
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:29,310
He's like the,
the paternal whore a of group.

1799
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:31,740
And the students covered in tattoos.
Yeah.

1800
01:16:31,741 --> 01:16:34,380
He's like a really like sweats himself
hard.

1801
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,431
Does he?
Yeah.

1802
01:16:35,431 --> 01:16:38,340
The guy in the left is like,
he connects with them like energy,

1803
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:41,580
American Indian,
native American.

1804
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:43,230
He's um,
he's Hawaiian,

1805
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,520
half black,
half white.

1806
01:16:44,521 --> 01:16:46,110
The guy next to him.
Can he,

1807
01:16:46,111 --> 01:16:49,410
can he can give you like that brother
Dick that he would have the hog or the

1808
01:16:49,411 --> 01:16:50,790
group?
Like she would have the biggest,

1809
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:55,110
oh he's got a hammer on them for sure.
But who's the Silver Fox on the

1810
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:57,930
one?
Who's this?

1811
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:00,500
The Guy I like.
How old's brace is like,

1812
01:17:00,501 --> 01:17:01,334
like as I said,
he's the,

1813
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,540
he's kind of like,
that's actually their book or the guy to

1814
01:17:03,541 --> 01:17:07,260
his left.
He runs the hooker studio and then

1815
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:09,830
that's a new hoe on the right.
A southern Whoa.

1816
01:17:09,831 --> 01:17:10,040
He's

1817
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:13,160
like from Nashville or something.
So the older gentleman,

1818
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:14,210
is he Hawaiian as well?
Yeah,

1819
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:16,970
he's having to brace,
has been doing it the longest.

1820
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:18,020
Um,
he's,

1821
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:21,020
he's been like,
he's been at at like 25,

1822
01:17:21,021 --> 01:17:21,920
30 years.
He's just,

1823
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:26,900
he's just been fucking and then got paid
cause he was realizing rob lowe a little

1824
01:17:26,901 --> 01:17:30,660
bit,
what it looks like Rob Lowe and his ice

1825
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:32,600
in the eyes.
You definitely shouldn't work for one of

1826
01:17:32,601 --> 01:17:33,434
those police.

1827
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,920
Okay.
This is what he sounded like.

1828
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,160
This guy,
they just,

1829
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,233
they just go,
what?

1830
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,990
This guy's a good guy.
He's been on our podcast a couple of

1831
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,680
times.
Fucking shitting me.

1832
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,730
Are you shitting me
on your podcast?

1833
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:53,360
But you had this fucking gun in your
pocket anytime when I was trying to

1834
01:17:53,361 --> 01:17:55,550
promote the spreadsheet.
You guys in that but you had a brace on.

1835
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:58,310
We haven't bumped for brazed men who
years ago.

1836
01:17:58,490 --> 01:17:59,323
Oh,
okay.

1837
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,720
But we haven't had a guest and jeers
birth doesn't have to be about you

1838
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:05,090
buddy.
They are talking about this hooker.

1839
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,590
Yeah,
he's a good guy.

1840
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,030
I bet he is.
But it isn't it fast

1841
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:12,970
that like a person who does that,
he's is,

1842
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,940
he always goes out of his way.
It'd be like,

1843
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:18,150
look dude,
I'm not a fucking $2 meet me in the

1844
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:19,090
alleyway.
Whoa.

1845
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,430
And I'm like,
I know,

1846
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:23,220
but it's just fun to call a guy a.
So yeah,

1847
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:28,410
he's kind of accept the fact,
you know what I was thinking that we

1848
01:18:28,411 --> 01:18:30,900
were talking about earlier about this a
Rhonda Rousey thing.

1849
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,400
Why,
why people are so mean.

1850
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:37,530
And I think there's a certain,
there's always going to be like a

1851
01:18:37,531 --> 01:18:42,531
certain backlash from someone who tries
to be extraordinary because it makes us

1852
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,800
feel like weak and,
and,

1853
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:53,490
and lazy and comparison and like not as
ambitious.

1854
01:18:53,491 --> 01:18:56,820
Like if someone wants to be the best
right at anything,

1855
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:58,800
if someone's true claims,
they're the best.

1856
01:18:58,801 --> 01:19:02,040
Whether it's conor mcgregor or whether
it's Ronda Rousey like that,

1857
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:07,190
that felt rushed to make it to number
one scares a lot of us.

1858
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:10,320
Yeah.
Cause it makes you look at what your,

1859
01:19:10,321 --> 01:19:12,840
what extent you're willing to go to for
what you want to achieve.

1860
01:19:12,841 --> 01:19:16,860
And then it makes you go,
am I actually doing things like

1861
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:19,830
fulfilling my own potential?
That's what those moments do.

1862
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:24,180
And you won't be going to if it goes
wrong,

1863
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:27,210
like way more than you want to punish
anyone else for anything else.

1864
01:19:27,211 --> 01:19:28,140
I've gone,
it goes wrong.

1865
01:19:28,141 --> 01:19:30,620
So then let's,
let's put this in perspective cause I

1866
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,130
just,
by the way,

1867
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:34,380
I've dumped talking about friends of
mine,

1868
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:38,610
I'm not calling people out at all,
but like I saw Kevin Hart today on CNN

1869
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:42,300
and it wasn't about comedy.
He was talking about how his job is now

1870
01:19:42,301 --> 01:19:44,790
to inspire people to be better and I was
like,

1871
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:46,860
I was like,
that's odd that I would hear Kevin talk

1872
01:19:46,861 --> 01:19:50,610
like that because he is funny as shit
and that's what he's really good at is

1873
01:19:50,611 --> 01:19:51,600
being fucking hilarious.

1874
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:55,440
But apparently is like a fist fitness
guru and like he's like a,

1875
01:19:55,441 --> 01:19:57,300
he's on a different level now and I
went,

1876
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:59,400
wow,
is that the level where people start to

1877
01:19:59,401 --> 01:20:02,550
fucking like what they did with amy or
what the,

1878
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,710
you know like,
or what they did with Dane is like you

1879
01:20:04,711 --> 01:20:08,820
see a comic get bigger than that and
then all of a sudden like slip up once

1880
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,980
and we'll fucking eat your lunch.
For sure.

1881
01:20:10,981 --> 01:20:13,200
There's a lot of that and it,
you know,

1882
01:20:13,201 --> 01:20:17,270
it's like you want to celebrate the
people that take the risk to climb to

1883
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:19,910
the highest mountains,
but you want a mock them if they meet

1884
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,650
they fall,
but it's oftentimes not the same people

1885
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,650
that are mocking them like we're all
experiencing.

1886
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:30,300
Like,
obviously I have zero animosity towards

1887
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:35,250
Ronda Rousey and a hundred percent
admiration for what she stands for as a

1888
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:37,390
competitor,
like which she tried to do and what she

1889
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:40,020
accomplished and the coming back thing.

1890
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:43,020
So I don't experience it on the negative
side,

1891
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:46,920
but the on the,
the people that do though,

1892
01:20:46,921 --> 01:20:49,770
the people that feel like they have a
free shot to go at,

1893
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,080
there's,
there's enough of them that it makes a

1894
01:20:52,081 --> 01:20:54,480
difference.
So even if all the same people

1895
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:57,480
appreciate you,
whether you win or lose the perspective

1896
01:20:57,481 --> 01:21:01,920
shifts because so many more people that
maybe you wouldn't normally narrowly be

1897
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:06,190
in contact with who are negative are
mocking it and,

1898
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:07,081
and,
and you know,

1899
01:21:07,081 --> 01:21:10,880
and really like being like absolutely
vicious about their,

1900
01:21:10,881 --> 01:21:15,881
the criticism and the way like trying to
knock you down when you're already down.

1901
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:19,440
It's not just a matter of it being
accurate or funny,

1902
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,980
which you're going to always have that
you're going to always have people that,

1903
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:24,620
that crack jokes and make fun.
It's always gonna exist,

1904
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,280
but it's,
there's this,

1905
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:29,390
there's this viciousness of attacking
somebody when they're there,

1906
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:31,290
there's some venom and everything.

1907
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:36,290
And that's part of me wonders like I go
is that like cobb never been cool with

1908
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:39,480
self promotion as well as made me feel
comfortable.

1909
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:42,300
But I've seen people in our business
that are very cool with it.

1910
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:43,051
Well,
you know,

1911
01:21:43,051 --> 01:21:45,120
Kevin Hart is a master at it,
you know,

1912
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,400
but he,
he's,

1913
01:21:47,401 --> 01:21:49,230
he knows what he's doing and he's a
very,

1914
01:21:49,231 --> 01:21:51,630
very smart guy,
very smart guy.

1915
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,780
He's very smart on many levels.
But at the,

1916
01:21:54,781 --> 01:21:57,100
at the ID I wonder,
I think Kevin would,

1917
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:59,300
I dunno,
Kevin would not say he's,

1918
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:04,170
he's aspiring to be a mogul.
He's aspiring to surpass not just being

1919
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:06,660
an entertainer but,
but to being a culture,

1920
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:09,390
culture,
culture influencer.

1921
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,650
And he is,
he already was that hard to say Coleman.

1922
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,200
Sure.
Influencer.

1923
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,290
But he has me,
it really was about it.

1924
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:20,390
Cool about him.
And now he's on the cover of fast

1925
01:22:20,391 --> 01:22:21,860
company and yeah,
I saw that.

1926
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,170
I was reading the article and it's just,
um,

1927
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:29,530
it's incredible the amount of things
he's gonna buy a studio,

1928
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:31,880
like a big warehouse,
actually,

1929
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:35,630
uh,
not far from here and wants to produce,

1930
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,160
you know,
tv shows,

1931
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:40,070
movies like online content.
All within there,

1932
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:43,310
continue to do movies.
Obviously he has the standup,

1933
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:44,173
he has,
he's an,

1934
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,700
you know,
has endorsements from like an athlete.

1935
01:22:46,701 --> 01:22:49,730
What all these different skills shooting
APP.

1936
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:51,980
Um,
I think he like just wizard.

1937
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:52,520
Yeah.
It's like,

1938
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,220
it's all right

1939
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:53,851
everybody.
I mean,

1940
01:22:53,851 --> 01:22:55,920
if you want to be that guy,
you should follow his footsteps.

1941
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:57,780
And by the way,
he's that guy.

1942
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:00,100
That's the other thing about Kevin or at
least that I,

1943
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:02,100
I don't,
I only know him from when we were kid.

1944
01:23:02,101 --> 01:23:04,500
Like when we're young starting from that
time.

1945
01:23:04,501 --> 01:23:05,860
I don't know him.
I haven't talked to him and

1946
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:10,150
probably probably 10 years that did a b
e t show with him.

1947
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:10,830
Did you?
Yeah,

1948
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:13,270
he's the greatest guy in the world.
Here's The v Wade is fucking guy in the

1949
01:23:13,271 --> 01:23:14,750
world.
But he met him once.

1950
01:23:14,751 --> 01:23:16,720
He's very nice guy,
but he's a,

1951
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:18,460
he,
I have a funny story about him.

1952
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:20,530
I bought a pair of Jordan's one time at,
uh,

1953
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:23,020
at the mall.
I was going to play basketball and I'd

1954
01:23:23,021 --> 01:23:24,160
bought Jordan's.
I didn't like,

1955
01:23:24,161 --> 01:23:26,620
I didn't know you didn't play basketball
and Jordans and uh,

1956
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,040
they put them on.
No,

1957
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:31,690
no.
That's the big thing in that light life

1958
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:33,370
lesson here.
What are you talking about?

1959
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:35,530
It's this when you're,
when you're black,

1960
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:37,181
you black.
No,

1961
01:23:37,181 --> 01:23:38,260
no,
but this is the rule.

1962
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:40,870
You don't win.
The Jordans are not meant for white

1963
01:23:40,871 --> 01:23:41,704
guys.

1964
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:45,400
Tommy,
Tommy,

1965
01:23:45,401 --> 01:23:46,300
Tommy.
I'm drunk already.

1966
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,130
So,
uh,

1967
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:50,950
when you're,
when you're black,

1968
01:23:50,951 --> 01:23:52,150
you play basketball,
basketball,

1969
01:23:52,151 --> 01:23:53,650
shoes,
like shitty shoes.

1970
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:56,470
But when you're in Jordans are meant for
like going out.

1971
01:23:56,650 --> 01:23:58,540
Jordan's wear like nice shoes.
You don't wear them on the basketball

1972
01:23:58,541 --> 01:23:59,740
court.
That's the rule.

1973
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,230
I didn't know that.
I bought a pair of Jordan's thinking I'd

1974
01:24:02,231 --> 01:24:03,880
go play basketball.
They're the best basketball shoes.

1975
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,890
That's not the rule.
So when you buy Jordans,

1976
01:24:05,891 --> 01:24:09,120
they come into Jordan bag that'll just
come in like a footlocker bag to coming

1977
01:24:09,121 --> 01:24:12,880
to Jordan bag.
Kevin Hart was in a mall and he saw me

1978
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:16,540
and my buddy croix walking through the
mall and I had a Jordan bag and Kevin

1979
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:21,210
came up and he grabbed my Jordan bag
from behind my back and he was give to

1980
01:24:21,211 --> 01:24:23,630
have Jordans.
And I turned around and all I saw was a

1981
01:24:23,631 --> 01:24:24,464
skin color.

1982
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:28,080
I didn't see Kevin.
And I went and I screamed and Kevin's

1983
01:24:28,081 --> 01:24:29,980
saw the racism in my eyes.
I'm like,

1984
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:30,873
oh,
Bert.

1985
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,711
And I was like,
sorry,

1986
01:24:32,711 --> 01:24:34,180
Kevin,
I didn't know it was you.

1987
01:24:34,181 --> 01:24:36,070
I thought it was just some black kid.
He was like,

1988
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:39,550
birds,
but use that racism or you'd being

1989
01:24:39,551 --> 01:24:43,660
robbed by someone who could probably run
faster than you.

1990
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:46,990
Fuck how has that racism.
But anyway,

1991
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:49,960
uh,
but I wasn't trying to say gimme them.

1992
01:24:49,961 --> 01:24:52,180
Jordan Jordan's,
he grabbed the bag and shook it and now

1993
01:24:52,190 --> 01:24:53,290
I freaked.
Dude,

1994
01:24:53,291 --> 01:24:56,290
I jolted like a shark in the water too.
If that was a Chinese guy,

1995
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,490
he'd be shitting your pants.
Yeah.

1996
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,550
If somebody else,
if they had been role reversed,

1997
01:24:59,551 --> 01:25:01,810
if he had done that to somebody,
there's a good chance that you'd gotten

1998
01:25:01,811 --> 01:25:05,660
punched or gone viral on Youtube.
That's a whole lot though.

1999
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,480
Definitely punched somebody if they
don't expect it.

2000
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:10,960
Like you know how sometimes you just
catch someone and they're already on

2001
01:25:10,961 --> 01:25:12,280
seven and you're like,
hey dude,

2002
01:25:12,281 --> 01:25:16,290
how'd you get to 70
let's go out.

2003
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:20,170
Oh sorry man,
my fucking wife just fucking give me a

2004
01:25:20,171 --> 01:25:23,360
hug
it out.

2005
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:25,210
And we've all been like,
you know,

2006
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:29,020
have you ever been in a road rage
situation where someone cuts you off and

2007
01:25:29,021 --> 01:25:33,210
you just get so much more mad than you
normally would get to know what you

2008
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:35,500
like,
you fucking cunt and you're like it.

2009
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:38,020
Where did this come from?
Like I had to react.

2010
01:25:38,021 --> 01:25:40,270
Obviously this person's an idiot.
This is a bad move,

2011
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,810
but why?
What is it that gets you to seven so

2012
01:25:43,811 --> 01:25:45,820
quickly?
Do you get that lesson where you live

2013
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:47,830
versus Hollywood now?
You can get it everywhere.

2014
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:51,700
When I drive out where you live or where
I live or where Tommy lives,

2015
01:25:51,701 --> 01:25:54,370
like this area,
it's a little chiller,

2016
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,240
like it's not,
Hollywood is fucking too,

2017
01:25:56,670 --> 01:25:59,350
too much,
really aggressive just outside of

2018
01:25:59,351 --> 01:26:01,570
Hollywood,
Hollywood adjacent where they can't

2019
01:26:01,571 --> 01:26:03,830
quite live in Hollywood,
but they right to it and they worked

2020
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:04,010
there

2021
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,843
and they get,
ah,

2022
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:07,160
yeah.
Studio city ish now.

2023
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:10,070
Like Sherman Oaks Ish.
A lot of fucking crazy drivers out

2024
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:10,880
there.
Yeah.

2025
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,160
T gritters you've arrived somewhere at a
seven,

2026
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:14,210
like yourself,
you know,

2027
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:16,580
like checking into a hotel.
Yeah,

2028
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:17,421
yeah,
I've done that.

2029
01:26:17,421 --> 01:26:18,320
Where I've,
um,

2030
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,600
you know,
it's a bunch of shit led to me getting

2031
01:26:20,601 --> 01:26:24,770
there and then I have like an exchange
with somebody and then later I'll go

2032
01:26:24,771 --> 01:26:26,340
back and be like,
Hey,

2033
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:29,420
I just want to tell you earlier when I
got here I felt like I was,

2034
01:26:29,421 --> 01:26:32,060
I'm a little short with you.
And they're like,

2035
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:32,841
oh,
no problem.

2036
01:26:32,841 --> 01:26:34,850
You know,
they're always very much downplaying it,

2037
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:36,350
but I'll feel bad about it.
You know,

2038
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:37,570
I had a fight with a,
uh,

2039
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:40,610
with a,
with a car driver that drove me from the

2040
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:43,970
airport in front of my house.
Like not a fist fight,

2041
01:26:43,971 --> 01:26:46,490
but a verbal fucking,
because he was late.

2042
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:48,260
He was like 30 minutes late to pick me
up.

2043
01:26:48,261 --> 01:26:50,240
And then when he did show up,
he was at the wrong terminal.

2044
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:53,510
And then when he did get me,
he blamed it on me for not telling him

2045
01:26:53,511 --> 01:26:54,500
where I was landing.
And I was like,

2046
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:56,300
that's not my job.
And then he got,

2047
01:26:56,301 --> 01:26:57,590
when I dropped,
when he dropped me off,

2048
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:59,930
he got mad at me because I didn't speak
to him the whole ride home.

2049
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:03,980
I'd headsets in and I fucking told you,
wait a minute,

2050
01:27:03,981 --> 01:27:05,360
he actually said,
he

2051
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:08,830
said,
do you really want to get to know you?

2052
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,610
I said to him,
I got out and I go,

2053
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,280
I've got a balanced to the man that's
not the best service I've ever had.

2054
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:14,870
And he goes,
well,

2055
01:27:14,871 --> 01:27:16,700
it was a little disrespectful.
You're not speaking to me.

2056
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:17,983
And I was like,
what?

2057
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:19,610
I think cause you didn't talk to me the
whole Rod.

2058
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:20,750
That's,
that's disrespectful.

2059
01:27:20,751 --> 01:27:22,670
I went,
it's not my fucking job to entertain

2060
01:27:22,671 --> 01:27:23,420
you.
I go,

2061
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:25,670
your job is to drive.
Do you think are hard for you to have a

2062
01:27:25,671 --> 01:27:28,190
conversation?
But I realized I'm having this fight

2063
01:27:28,191 --> 01:27:30,440
with this guy in front of my house.
I don't know anything about him.

2064
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,930
And I was like,
and then I was like,

2065
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:34,011
and I have,
by the way,

2066
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:35,590
I was going to tip him in the middle of
like,

2067
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,310
he's yelling at you.
And I said,

2068
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:38,510
I had 20 bucks in my hand.
And he goes,

2069
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,411
I go,
just so you know,

2070
01:27:39,411 --> 01:27:41,120
that wasn't the best experience I've had
or whatever.

2071
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,940
And then I had the 20 bucks in my hand
and he was like sort of disrespectful

2072
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:45,680
and then we sort of going back and
forth.

2073
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,760
Then I was like,
fuck you,

2074
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,980
I'm not giving this to you.
And then in a weird way I went bird give

2075
01:27:48,981 --> 01:27:50,690
it to him or he's going to come back and
murder your family.

2076
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:51,711
And so I was like,
all right,

2077
01:27:51,711 --> 01:27:52,700
you know what?
Take it where even,

2078
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:55,580
and then I had to come back and go,
I apologize.

2079
01:27:56,110 --> 01:27:58,310
I sh I and I,
and this is the weird part about my

2080
01:27:58,311 --> 01:27:59,690
brain,
that is what I started this whole

2081
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:01,880
fucking talk about is,
is that I start going,

2082
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,510
hey burt,
how important in this fucking spectrum

2083
01:28:05,511 --> 01:28:09,320
of life is it that this guy is throat?
How often have you been 30 minutes late?

2084
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:12,230
Helps me to be 30 minutes late and then
maybe got an attitude because you were

2085
01:28:12,231 --> 01:28:13,041
defensive.
I don't know.

2086
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:14,870
Maybe this guy was as a cuckold.
I don't know.

2087
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:16,820
That's what I thought about today.
When you were late.

2088
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:22,060
I was at least two minutes late.
I ran here to no fucking avail.

2089
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:23,630
It was close.
I should,

2090
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,100
Uber driver dropped me off in front of
[inaudible]

2091
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:25,741
place.
You know what?

2092
01:28:25,741 --> 01:28:28,000
I'm mad at me.
I think the reality of people talking to

2093
01:28:28,001 --> 01:28:33,001
each other is we it comment exchanges
sometimes and things get started like

2094
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:36,790
right away,
like something goes wrong with him and

2095
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:39,520
he shows up late.
And so your interaction with him has

2096
01:28:39,521 --> 01:28:42,190
already unbalanced because you expect
him to be apologetic.

2097
01:28:42,191 --> 01:28:43,900
But how could he really apologize?
You know,

2098
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:45,310
you fucked up.
You did.

2099
01:28:45,311 --> 01:28:48,220
So now I know who you are.
You're that guy who doesn't take his job

2100
01:28:48,221 --> 01:28:51,340
at seriously and you're gonna drive me.
I'm just going to put my headphone sets

2101
01:28:51,341 --> 01:28:54,640
in and he's mad at you that you do that.
Like there's a lot of things going on

2102
01:28:54,641 --> 01:28:55,091
there,
man.

2103
01:28:55,091 --> 01:28:59,110
And maybe if he showed up on time,
the same guy and you would have had a

2104
01:28:59,111 --> 01:28:59,944
great old time.

2105
01:29:00,330 --> 01:29:02,280
Maybe there was a where he's driving

2106
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:04,570
and my headsets are in and they're
really good noise reduction headsets.

2107
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:06,960
Their molds to your ear.
Maybe he was driving.

2108
01:29:06,961 --> 01:29:07,830
He's like,
hey man,

2109
01:29:07,831 --> 01:29:11,880
I'm really sorry I'm going through a lot
of shit speech and I just like this,

2110
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:14,280
right?
I mean,

2111
01:29:14,281 --> 01:29:16,600
I dunno.
There's a lot of scenarios that could

2112
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,740
have happened for sure.
I always got things out of assumptions.

2113
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:22,720
You make assumptions always like,
eh,

2114
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:25,770
but he looked like this and then the way
that he looked,

2115
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,620
I know that guy's an asshole.
You don't know what he was like,

2116
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:30,030
are you ready for the difference of what
you look like,

2117
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:32,280
Tommy?
It looks different.

2118
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,430
I mean I'm being serious when I say that
from the weight loss.

2119
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:36,900
You look,
you look,

2120
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:40,410
there was a,
there's a assuming this to you like when

2121
01:29:40,411 --> 01:29:43,490
I watched your last special mostly
stories mostly.

2122
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:47,700
Is that the way you say supposed to hit
mostly stories like that Kansas City

2123
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:51,480
improv this weekend.
But like there is like a real fucking

2124
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:52,710
coolness to you.
Like a,

2125
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:57,610
like a Carmel Coolness to you.
But now you look like a fucking like,

2126
01:29:57,630 --> 01:29:59,370
like,
and so when you meet people,

2127
01:29:59,371 --> 01:30:01,620
do you see people perceiving you
differently?

2128
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:04,410
Mm,
not really not.

2129
01:30:04,411 --> 01:30:08,160
I mean there's,
so most people that you know would come

2130
01:30:08,161 --> 01:30:11,520
to my show are not those people.
Not that I'm talking about a starbucks.

2131
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:15,270
Holy Shit.
Look at the difference in between you

2132
01:30:15,271 --> 01:30:16,740
and then hold.
Look at me.

2133
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:17,370
Turn,
turn,

2134
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:19,140
turn straight on.
Shit Tom.

2135
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,820
Wow.
Crazy.

2136
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:29,250
Tom fucking neck is bigger.
Your head's bigger.

2137
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,250
This is bigger.
Your shoulder face is so much bigger,

2138
01:30:32,251 --> 01:30:34,950
so much bigger.
Everything is bigger fingers.

2139
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,290
Is your ring looser?
Yes.

2140
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:39,300
Do you feel like God's telling us we
should cheat?

2141
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:44,010
Take it off.
You look good.

2142
01:30:44,011 --> 01:30:47,080
Tom and burt run trains on pitches.
Um,

2143
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:48,930
yeah,
pull up police pull up.

2144
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,360
Uh,
burt's eventually.

2145
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:53,100
What's it called?
Sometimes I'm not,

2146
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:58,210
I'm only 15 pounds lighter
in that for the special,

2147
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,220
the Special Ed.
Shy.

2148
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,390
Let's wait for the special.
Do you got,

2149
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:04,671
oh no,
no,

2150
01:31:04,671 --> 01:31:05,131
no.
You want to,

2151
01:31:05,131 --> 01:31:06,660
you want to see a good one.
Here we go.

2152
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:09,420
Pull up Ari.
Shaffir lying dildos.

2153
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:12,540
You get that one right there.
That's not as good as flying dildos.

2154
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:14,300
Go to flying Delta as this is when I was
off balance.

2155
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:16,170
He's right.
He's right.

2156
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,710
Codeship fears flying dildos.
It's good.

2157
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,553
It's on youtube.

2158
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,510
Yes,
he is.

2159
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:23,460
It just,
it just posted it today.

2160
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,400
Go to a video and you'll see me.
Oh,

2161
01:31:26,401 --> 01:31:27,960
this is me.
Just obese.

2162
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:30,930
What about that picture right there?
The one with the pole.

2163
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,810
Very big.
Can't you be like,

2164
01:31:32,811 --> 01:31:34,940
can't you go full screen?
No it doesn't,

2165
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:37,160
but yeah,
will definitely like,

2166
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:38,550
oh my God.
Look Chinese.

2167
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:41,010
You look a lot fatter.
You look so happy.

2168
01:31:41,011 --> 01:31:42,840
And we baked there.
What a beautiful scenery.

2169
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,480
So fucked up.
Is that one?

2170
01:31:44,481 --> 01:31:46,480
It was Hong Kong suits are he got,
yeah.

2171
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:47,880
What's up?
Beautiful God damn suit.

2172
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,740
It's the waffles and the collar and
everything.

2173
01:31:49,741 --> 01:31:53,210
I got a couple of there too.
It's like a fun little experience to go

2174
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:55,420
in Hong Kong and Hong Kong.
Yeah.

2175
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,390
Wow.
That's the only thing that's changed is

2176
01:31:57,391 --> 01:32:02,090
this little fold right here.
Yeah.

2177
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:03,700
I wanted to get rid of that.

2178
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:05,480
They're like,
what?

2179
01:32:05,481 --> 01:32:06,314
Wait,
are you,

2180
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:08,630
uh,
probably two 51.

2181
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:09,591
Yeah,
dude,

2182
01:32:09,591 --> 01:32:10,730
you,
you look really different.

2183
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:11,451
Well,
you dude,

2184
01:32:11,451 --> 01:32:14,120
you still lost 30 fucking pounds.
I mean you're,

2185
01:32:14,121 --> 01:32:16,280
you're kind of down on yourself a little
bit in this thing.

2186
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:17,810
That's a giant accomplishment.
You know,

2187
01:32:17,811 --> 01:32:22,250
a few people have the willpower to lose
30 pounds like that in that quick of

2188
01:32:22,251 --> 01:32:24,440
amount of time.
And that was a Herculean effort.

2189
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,790
You guys,
I don't understand.

2190
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:30,440
I don't even even know if you understand
the impact that it has on people.

2191
01:32:30,650 --> 01:32:32,360
When someone does that and you see
people do it,

2192
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:34,130
there's so many people out there right
now.

2193
01:32:34,190 --> 01:32:37,100
They didn't think that they had the
ability inside them to do it.

2194
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,620
Yeah.
But they love you guys and they listen

2195
01:32:39,621 --> 01:32:41,920
to your podcast and they hang out with
you guys when you,

2196
01:32:41,921 --> 01:32:43,340
you know,
you do shows in their town.

2197
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:44,690
They do.
They come to the show.

2198
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:47,050
They know that you did it.
You just,

2199
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:49,430
you did it and you didn't.
There's nothing like,

2200
01:32:49,431 --> 01:32:50,960
I know you're a person.
You did it.

2201
01:32:50,990 --> 01:32:53,060
I'm 30 pounds overweight.
I want to lose the weight.

2202
01:32:53,061 --> 01:32:54,800
I know burt did it.
I can do it too.

2203
01:32:54,801 --> 01:32:56,080
Now.
That's real.

2204
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:59,310
Those are the coolest tweets.
We get a lot of really cool ones where

2205
01:32:59,311 --> 01:33:00,770
you go like,
Whoa,

2206
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,460
hey man.
I like when they're,

2207
01:33:02,461 --> 01:33:03,840
they do it and there's a joke attached
to,

2208
01:33:03,841 --> 01:33:05,080
but like they go,
hey man,

2209
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:06,750
this has been the coolest thing I've
ever seen.

2210
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:07,920
Come out.
Bell.

2211
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:10,440
Did you see his tweets come off?
That was like the,

2212
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:12,480
I didn't think this will be as fun as it
is.

2213
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:13,890
This is awesome.
I want to be a part of it.

2214
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,240
Yeah.
He wanted to lose some weight.

2215
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:18,690
I thought that was really cool.
Miles was such a fucking great,

2216
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,330
I've had them on before.
He's a super nice guy.

2217
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:22,490
Super Smart.
Yeah.

2218
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,020
We're talking about doing another one.
That would be great if you wanted to do

2219
01:33:25,021 --> 01:33:25,490
that.

2220
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:27,050
Who does he want to do it with?
I don't know.

2221
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:31,070
Got to find a buddy lawrence.
Pick someone you hate.

2222
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:35,090
That's what
it's gotta be.

2223
01:33:35,091 --> 01:33:37,730
Someone you love,
so it's good natured and it's fun and

2224
01:33:37,731 --> 01:33:39,020
it's encouraging.
You don't,

2225
01:33:39,021 --> 01:33:41,660
then people could do it too.
It could become like your own personal

2226
01:33:41,661 --> 01:33:46,010
roast battle.
You know there were shots fired back and

2227
01:33:46,011 --> 01:33:49,100
forth from between me and Tom.
That was what made it fun though,

2228
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:51,530
man.
We played yesterday.

2229
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:52,720
As a fan,
I would go,

2230
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:54,770
I would have been like,
I like these guys.

2231
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:57,620
This is what I'm fucking talking about.
Yeah.

2232
01:33:57,621 --> 01:33:59,990
Years called the Tommy.
Drink your vodka soda.

2233
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:02,390
Just drink.
Hold on.

2234
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:05,990
Ra responded on the end of his podcast.
He released today giving it play.

2235
01:34:05,991 --> 01:34:06,990
What?
He says,

2236
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:08,850
I know what he says.
I know what he said.

2237
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:10,820
Just play it.
I think it's better to play.

2238
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:11,880
Let's play.
Let's play.

2239
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:13,160
Talk Shit about them.
Know

2240
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:17,660
that son of a ball.
Tommy drink some fucking bucket for

2241
01:34:17,661 --> 01:34:22,661
inviting me over to your place
to my favorite people ever did that took

2242
01:34:26,271 --> 01:34:28,700
place and what I didn't.
First of all,

2243
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:32,270
there's no way in my mind I expected to
lose that bet.

2244
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:38,080
One of them to be below a piece was fee.
I can beyond incomprehensible for both

2245
01:34:39,051 --> 01:34:41,930
of them.
It was a sure thing for me.

2246
01:34:42,170 --> 01:34:45,260
It was a sure thing.
I mean it turns a back of bets like we

2247
01:34:45,261 --> 01:34:48,830
do on punch drunk.
This one sporting event,

2248
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:52,100
fucking golden.
I've got it in the bag.

2249
01:34:52,490 --> 01:34:56,420
Of course they're not both going to be
under obese and I guess they are.

2250
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,010
I my,
I hope.

2251
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:02,780
I'm hoping that that tomorrow they're
going to weigh in and they're going to

2252
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:05,870
be a little bigger and maybe,
maybe Saguaro only be six feet tall if

2253
01:35:05,871 --> 01:35:07,630
he's six feet tall.
He's right on the border right now.

2254
01:35:07,631 --> 01:35:10,340
It will be so not bs.
It's at six one thing that gets them

2255
01:35:10,341 --> 01:35:13,940
under six feet,
he gains about a point and a half on his

2256
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:14,690
BMI.
That's,

2257
01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:17,330
that's one of my only hopes that tape
measure.

2258
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:19,340
If he's five [inaudible] 11 then I'm
good.

2259
01:35:19,341 --> 01:35:21,290
But it doesn't seem like people are
believing that.

2260
01:35:21,291 --> 01:35:24,770
But Segura said he was five 11 and now
I've got these people fucking

2261
01:35:24,771 --> 01:35:27,050
threatening me.
Patricia media.

2262
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:30,230
I've got people threatening me and
telling me like,

2263
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:34,130
uh,
the call me Welcher we haven't even had

2264
01:35:34,131 --> 01:35:36,650
the to weigh ins yet.
We're supposed to have three ways,

2265
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:37,880
but fine for go.
The first one,

2266
01:35:37,881 --> 01:35:39,680
the first,
I'm assuming they did that one at home.

2267
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:42,210
I rogan second,
third,

2268
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:43,970
two days in a row.
They got a charm.

2269
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:45,180
I haven't been efficient.
La Show.

2270
01:35:45,181 --> 01:35:48,320
I got people threatening me.
I don't feel safe.

2271
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:50,990
They know what sitting,
they're 11 and then,

2272
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:54,320
and then these are my friends.
My friends are coming at me.

2273
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:55,933
I was like,
all right,

2274
01:35:56,980 --> 01:35:59,020
I'll off the off chance.
I lose what?

2275
01:35:59,120 --> 01:35:59,811
What?
Oh,

2276
01:35:59,811 --> 01:36:02,300
we all go to a dodger game.
That'd be fun.

2277
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:04,820
That'd be fun.
You lost some weight.

2278
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:05,901
Go.
No,

2279
01:36:05,901 --> 01:36:07,250
don't have,
don't have a dodger dog.

2280
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:12,110
Don't have the extra large one.
Each barbecue fucking seven times a

2281
01:36:12,111 --> 01:36:15,320
week.
How in the world does he lose 15 pounds

2282
01:36:16,490 --> 01:36:19,010
30 how does that happen?

2283
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:25,550
And then I got my friends set me up for
fucking,

2284
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:28,760
they want first class tickets.
So Europe,

2285
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:33,130
I don't know what to do.
I get fucking,

2286
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:37,640
I'm,
I'm a,

2287
01:36:37,670 --> 01:36:38,420
I'm a,
I'm a,

2288
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:40,040
I'm flustered.
I'm flustered for sure.

2289
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:40,910
I'm,
I'm afraid

2290
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:46,550
I can't be here with this.
I can't be here with them coming after

2291
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:50,480
me like this.
The heaven even weighed in the second

2292
01:36:50,481 --> 01:36:51,440
day,
but it's going to happen.

2293
01:36:51,441 --> 01:36:53,210
I know what's going to happen tomorrow.
She'll throw each,

2294
01:36:53,211 --> 01:36:57,690
lose a pound
unless it's,

2295
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,950
unless Tom's five 11 I mean that's a,
that's a chance.

2296
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:06,380
If Tom's five 11 I got a chance.
That'll mean he'd win the bet for most

2297
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:09,470
loss of weight,
but they wouldn't both be under obese.

2298
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:15,510
So fucking burt would have to
you guys,

2299
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:17,760
you,
you haven't dealt with this kind of like

2300
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:21,170
backlash until you've dealt with it.
You haven't dealt with it.

2301
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:26,030
That guy who killed the lion in Zimbabwe
or Zaire,

2302
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:29,090
one of those places,
Africa

2303
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:35,330
got on him for killing Chutney until you
find out,

2304
01:37:35,331 --> 01:37:37,760
oh,
there's 80 80 80 lions get killed every

2305
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:38,810
year.
They've got to keep the population down

2306
01:37:38,811 --> 01:37:41,030
and they start killing babies,
human babies.

2307
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:44,780
But nobody cares about that.
So this fucking dentist in Rhode Island

2308
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,840
has to face death threats all the time.
You don't know what it's like to get a

2309
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:51,830
fucking he rage against shoe and these
people are coming at me and my phone

2310
01:37:51,831 --> 01:37:53,690
calls my texts.
It's,

2311
01:37:53,691 --> 01:37:54,620
you know,
first of all,

2312
01:37:54,621 --> 01:37:57,750
I can't thread with a flip phone.
So every test comes in new.

2313
01:37:57,930 --> 01:37:59,100
They ask questions like,
what does that mean?

2314
01:37:59,101 --> 01:38:02,360
I have to delete my texts after awhile
because I have to make room for once.

2315
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,380
So you've got some,
Laura's saying,

2316
01:38:04,381 --> 01:38:06,360
open up your wallet.
Do you have any fucking won the bet yet?

2317
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:11,190
Football,
European football.

2318
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:12,870
I can't,
I can't do this.

2319
01:38:12,871 --> 01:38:13,890
I can't deal with it.
Listen to me.

2320
01:38:13,891 --> 01:38:18,891
I'm fucking flustered.
It's very possible that he's,

2321
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,580
that he's under height.
Barring that,

2322
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:26,370
I don't know.
I can't be here for this.

2323
01:38:26,371 --> 01:38:28,620
I can't,
I can't be here with them coming after

2324
01:38:28,621 --> 01:38:30,060
me.
I gotta get Outta here.

2325
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:34,110
Hilarious man.
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

2326
01:38:34,111 --> 01:38:37,680
And I got to get away from this until I
could figure out what to do.

2327
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:41,330
I got it.
That's what I gotta do.

2328
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:44,210
That's what I gotta I gotta get the fuck
away from this.

2329
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:48,853
Yeah.

2330
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:51,910
Yeah.
That's my answer.

2331
01:38:56,530 --> 01:38:58,750
Anybody wants to listen to the rest of
it or all of it?

2332
01:38:59,190 --> 01:39:00,430
Just fears.
Skeptic tanks.

2333
01:39:00,431 --> 01:39:03,010
One of my favorite podcasts,
I was doing it all the time.

2334
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:05,650
It's awesome.
I recommend the Henry Rollins one,

2335
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,430
which,
uh,

2336
01:39:06,430 --> 01:39:09,790
burt scoffed at the sky.
Hetero is different than I am.

2337
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:12,910
Extremely dismissive of them.
Fuck off.

2338
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,400
And it was insulting.
He's got a gang of them.

2339
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:17,650
Dave Smith is a great one.
No,

2340
01:39:17,651 --> 01:39:18,371
no.
The best one.

2341
01:39:18,371 --> 01:39:20,170
The best ones running of the bulls.
Oh,

2342
01:39:20,171 --> 01:39:22,910
that's a great one to getting great.
One's got a lot of great ones already.

2343
01:39:22,930 --> 01:39:25,990
Has a really,
really good podcasts going to run off.

2344
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:27,610
He's gonna run off the map right now for
awhile.

2345
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:28,540
He was just good.
Good,

2346
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:29,740
good.
He needs to,

2347
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:31,850
I mean,
if he thinks he needs to,

2348
01:39:31,851 --> 01:39:32,770
he needs to.
And what,

2349
01:39:32,771 --> 01:39:37,690
what I love about what Ari's doing is
he's living his life 100% on his terms.

2350
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:40,690
He's not doing it by anybody else's
standards and he does.

2351
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:45,490
He's doing the exact what I think the
best thing at comic can do if you makes

2352
01:39:45,491 --> 01:39:50,491
it like once you make it like relax and
just just have fun and be yourself and

2353
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:53,380
only do the things you want to do and
don't let him suck in and nonsense.

2354
01:39:53,381 --> 01:39:54,910
But you've been on both sides of that
fence.

2355
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:55,691
Yeah,
for sure.

2356
01:39:55,691 --> 01:39:59,290
The fear factor was like post,
I'm talking about post rarely.

2357
01:39:59,291 --> 01:40:00,310
Pre family.
Yeah,

2358
01:40:00,311 --> 01:40:01,660
that too.
Oh yeah,

2359
01:40:01,661 --> 01:40:03,850
that's a different thing.
I mean if he had a family it would be

2360
01:40:03,851 --> 01:40:07,480
totally different thing,
but he or even if even considered having

2361
01:40:07,481 --> 01:40:09,550
one or even a girlfriend,
it'd be a different thing.

2362
01:40:09,551 --> 01:40:14,551
But he's been tied down the past and
right now what Ari's enjoying is like

2363
01:40:15,341 --> 01:40:17,380
creating stand up,
doing standup,

2364
01:40:17,381 --> 01:40:22,381
doing his podcast and just enjoying life
and enhancing his perspective and taking

2365
01:40:22,631 --> 01:40:23,464
it all in.

2366
01:40:23,690 --> 01:40:26,340
And these trips that he goes on,
he's,

2367
01:40:26,410 --> 01:40:29,440
he's like orchestrating them.
He wants to see things he wants to,

2368
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:32,620
he wants to absorb experiences from
other parts of the world.

2369
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:35,650
And it's all enhancing his standup too,
that it's very,

2370
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:38,860
very accurate.
And I say this as I've said this from my

2371
01:40:38,861 --> 01:40:40,540
perspective,
um,

2372
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:44,180
as probably an expert in world travel,
I would tell you our,

2373
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:46,420
he does it better than anybody.
And I'm not even fucking around.

2374
01:40:46,421 --> 01:40:50,590
I've done it for seven years straight,
but Ari went to Switzerland and,

2375
01:40:50,650 --> 01:40:54,100
and had a different life experience than
I did and went now mine was

2376
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,810
under production,
but like,

2377
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:59,410
he really does it great.
I wanted to pitch a show so bad,

2378
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:01,450
uh,
that were,

2379
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:02,350
uh,
you know,

2380
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,390
Ari's disappearing right now.
I wanted to pitch a show.

2381
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:05,470
Go.
Can I find Ari?

2382
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:06,730
Like,
can I find them?

2383
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:07,960
Well,
you'll be able to find him.

2384
01:41:07,961 --> 01:41:10,600
It's social media.
Some time off the grid.

2385
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:14,230
He's going off the fucking green.
Does that mean now he's going to go

2386
01:41:14,231 --> 01:41:15,550
where there's,
you know,

2387
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:18,540
he's not bringing any laptop or anything
like that.

2388
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:21,100
And he was disappearing for real.
Other people have phones.

2389
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:22,270
It's true.
It's true.

2390
01:41:22,630 --> 01:41:23,231
They'll say,
oh,

2391
01:41:23,231 --> 01:41:27,430
Ari's in Sweden,
Micronesia or some shit.

2392
01:41:27,431 --> 01:41:29,650
He's trying to go off path.
Stuff's to get malaria.

2393
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:31,990
The pills.
I told him to take,

2394
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,310
dude,
do not take the pills.

2395
01:41:33,311 --> 01:41:35,050
Malaria pills.
Cause we've talked about.

2396
01:41:35,051 --> 01:41:37,540
I thought I'd fucking,
and then you get the injections though.

2397
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:40,090
I had a horrific experience on do
vaccinations,

2398
01:41:40,091 --> 01:41:42,060
vaccinations or just don't take them at
all.

2399
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:43,840
You're probably not gonna get malaria.
Why?

2400
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:47,930
I thought a lot of people get malaria.
No Africa they've talked to about to

2401
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:49,930
about this on your podcast.
I took malaria pills.

2402
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:52,180
I was puking.
I was younger.

2403
01:41:52,181 --> 01:41:55,360
That charts for awhile.
My friend Justin Wren got malaria three

2404
01:41:55,361 --> 01:41:56,920
times though.
Three times.

2405
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:59,890
Fuck.
Malarial the Dang gay fevers.

2406
01:41:59,891 --> 01:42:02,680
One you don't want to get well,
malaria has killed half the people that

2407
01:42:02,681 --> 01:42:04,430
have ever lived.
He got the topic.

2408
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:04,811
Yeah,
yeah,

2409
01:42:04,811 --> 01:42:06,340
yeah.
In the book or half the people that have

2410
01:42:06,341 --> 01:42:08,860
ever died,
half the people that have ever died have

2411
01:42:08,861 --> 01:42:09,990
died from malaria.
You have it.

2412
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,840
That's where before they had malaria.
But they don't take them though.

2413
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:19,930
Do you understand the posture?
Snus

2414
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:23,170
light that up one more time,
Tommy.

2415
01:42:23,171 --> 01:42:24,730
Let's get,
let's see how fucked up we can get.

2416
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:26,290
Come on.
And Tommy,

2417
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:30,200
come on.
Pretend you're big galleries texting,

2418
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:31,230
tenure,
big Tommy,

2419
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:36,010
just trooper happy that is rich friend
decided to step in and flip the bill.

2420
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:37,420
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.

2421
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:39,130
Hey Joe,
did you ever hear the ballot of Big

2422
01:42:39,131 --> 01:42:41,320
Tommy bonds?
That's pretty fun.

2423
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:43,810
The song I wrote,
I'm not gonna let you play it here,

2424
01:42:43,811 --> 01:42:48,370
but like I wrote a song about Tom and
that was the greatest part of this whole

2425
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:51,400
thing is I really had a song.
Oh yeah,

2426
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:53,620
the ballot and played and sang.
I wrote,

2427
01:42:53,621 --> 01:42:55,840
played and sang a song called the ballad
of big tummy buns.

2428
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:56,740
Oh,
how dare you.

2429
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:58,330
And I was,
but my,

2430
01:42:58,390 --> 01:43:01,570
the one cool thing about this,
and this is esoteric.

2431
01:43:01,650 --> 01:43:02,483
Well,
I might as well hear this.

2432
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:04,780
I don't think I've ever said anything.
It's esoteric,

2433
01:43:04,781 --> 01:43:07,280
but please continue.
You never said it way before you had to

2434
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:09,910
join.
I'd never said this is esoteric.

2435
01:43:09,911 --> 01:43:13,840
This is so fucking high.
I think I exactly know what esoteric

2436
01:43:13,841 --> 01:43:14,710
meats.
I don't either,

2437
01:43:14,711 --> 01:43:15,970
Joe,
but it sounds good in a sentence.

2438
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:18,310
Like,
what did it give me the exact definition

2439
01:43:18,311 --> 01:43:20,110
of esoteric.
Yeah.

2440
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:21,850
Pull that up.
Okay.

2441
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:24,190
What do you think esoteric mean?
It's a out there.

2442
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,390
Yeah,
right.

2443
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:28,440
Bizarre.
What would it,

2444
01:43:28,441 --> 01:43:30,400
what does it mean here?
Intended or likely to be understood by a

2445
01:43:30,401 --> 01:43:32,590
small number of people with specialized
knowledge?

2446
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:34,840
This is esoteric.
This is esoteric.

2447
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:39,970
So this one I'm about to say is that
Sotera intended or likely to be

2448
01:43:39,971 --> 01:43:43,840
understood by only a small number of
people with a specialized knowledge or

2449
01:43:43,841 --> 01:43:47,200
interest or an enlightened inner circle.
Joe Rogan.

2450
01:43:47,201 --> 01:43:50,230
This is esoteric when I'm about to say,
and you will get this more than anyone.

2451
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:51,853
That's a lot of pressure

2452
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:55,580
to hit that and then listen,
I think you'll get it.

2453
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:59,780
Do you know how sometimes when you work
for a corporation and your paycheck is

2454
01:43:59,781 --> 01:44:01,850
dependent on that corporations approval?
Not right now.

2455
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:03,530
I'm in the middle of an esoteric
statement.

2456
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:05,270
Yes.
Okay.

2457
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:07,880
And so,
and then you get out from under that

2458
01:44:07,881 --> 01:44:10,670
corporation and all of a sudden you are
the one that kind of,

2459
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:11,780
uh,
you get,

2460
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:14,090
you almost like feel your creativity
again.

2461
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:15,050
You like,
you go like,

2462
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:16,310
oh fuck,
I forgot.

2463
01:44:16,311 --> 01:44:19,880
I'm a really great standup.
I forgot that I'm passionate about

2464
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,260
making video.
Like,

2465
01:44:21,261 --> 01:44:22,094
you know,
you know,

2466
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:22,671
and you go,
oh,

2467
01:44:22,671 --> 01:44:23,910
I can be my own voice.
I have,

2468
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:26,720
it's my own ship now.
I forgot that when I started this

2469
01:44:26,721 --> 01:44:28,400
business,
uh,

2470
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:30,680
the goal wasn't to get under the
umbrella.

2471
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:33,860
The goal was to be out there in the
fucking ocean by myself in sailing my

2472
01:44:33,861 --> 01:44:36,320
own ship and saying,
go take a left.

2473
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,190
Fuck it.
Right.

2474
01:44:37,530 --> 01:44:41,000
Um,
this weight loss battle coincided with

2475
01:44:41,001 --> 01:44:44,960
my decision to stop being under contract
for travel channel.

2476
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:47,030
And I was,
I was really lost.

2477
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:48,920
I was really lost.
And I was like,

2478
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:51,980
I didn't know where I'd wear.
I didn't know if I should just take

2479
01:44:51,981 --> 01:44:54,420
another television deal and it,
or just do another deal with trial.

2480
01:44:54,490 --> 01:44:56,360
I didn't know what to do.
I really didn't know what to do.

2481
01:44:57,020 --> 01:44:57,411
And,
uh,

2482
01:44:57,411 --> 01:44:59,310
this weight loss battle happened around
that time and it,

2483
01:44:59,350 --> 01:45:02,780
and it,
and like bill burst says poetically.

2484
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:05,390
I started taking on water and I felt
fucking crazy about it.

2485
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:07,280
And then one morning I woke up and I
went,

2486
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:11,090
oh tom is having a lot of fun with this.
Like he's having fun him and push her

2487
01:45:11,091 --> 01:45:13,940
having a lot of fun and I was like,
I'm going to write a song and I wrote a

2488
01:45:13,941 --> 01:45:15,170
song and I wrote this stupid song.

2489
01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:16,610
I thought I looked,
I was like,

2490
01:45:16,670 --> 01:45:19,370
I was,
but it was like I felt very creative and

2491
01:45:19,371 --> 01:45:21,500
I didn't feel like there was any
parameters on me anymore and I was like,

2492
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:23,720
oh,
this is what my career is about.

2493
01:45:23,721 --> 01:45:27,410
My career is about doing everything I
like and everything I like and if you'd

2494
01:45:27,411 --> 01:45:29,000
like what I like,
come see me to stand up.

2495
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:31,370
But if you don't like what I liked,
like fuck it,

2496
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:33,080
this is what I like to do.
This is my,

2497
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:35,900
this is my walk,
this is my walk through the woods.

2498
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:38,330
And it was like,
and I know that,

2499
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:41,680
I don't think Tommy can attest to that
as much as you can because being under a

2500
01:45:41,681 --> 01:45:43,550
fear factor,
I don't think you ever were like under

2501
01:45:43,551 --> 01:45:45,290
anyone's control,
but there's definitely a,

2502
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:47,360
a corporate umbrella that you're under
where you're like,

2503
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:47,910
oh,
I can't show,

2504
01:45:47,910 --> 01:45:48,231
hey,
you know,

2505
01:45:48,231 --> 01:45:50,390
how long did I not smoke pot on camera
again?

2506
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:51,440
You know,
like long time.

2507
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:54,260
Yeah.
And so as soon as that fucking happened,

2508
01:45:54,261 --> 01:45:56,270
all that happened,
I wrote that song and it was like,

2509
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:57,740
it's one of those moments where you're
just like,

2510
01:45:57,980 --> 01:45:59,450
oh,
I get to do whatever the fuck I want to

2511
01:45:59,451 --> 01:46:02,030
do anymore.
Like I'm just a dude that likes for

2512
01:46:02,031 --> 01:46:03,740
comedy the same way our he is where he
goes,

2513
01:46:03,741 --> 01:46:05,120
I'm getting off the grid.
That freedom,

2514
01:46:05,630 --> 01:46:09,470
that freedom man being untethered.
Ari and I had a long podcast about being

2515
01:46:09,471 --> 01:46:11,780
untethered.
Being untethered is so cool.

2516
01:46:11,781 --> 01:46:13,820
As an artist,
you just get to do what you want to do.

2517
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:15,290
You know?
It's why we love.

2518
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,540
That's why we probably love guys like
Ron White,

2519
01:46:17,541 --> 01:46:18,860
Jim Jefferies,
these guys that are,

2520
01:46:18,861 --> 01:46:21,320
that are bill burr there just
untethered.

2521
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:22,213
No,
sorry.

2522
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:26,240
I get inspired by the way,
are he's living.

2523
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:27,620
I really do.
I really,

2524
01:46:27,621 --> 01:46:28,454
I,
it's,

2525
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:31,490
it gives me enthusiasm.
He's having fun.

2526
01:46:31,491 --> 01:46:33,710
These creatings doing stand up.
He's just,

2527
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:37,910
he's making rational choices regardless
of like how much money it'll cost him.

2528
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:39,830
And he's like,
this is what I want to do for my art.

2529
01:46:39,831 --> 01:46:41,060
This is what I want to do for my
standup.

2530
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:43,550
I'm taking time off.
I'm just going to go and experience life

2531
01:46:43,551 --> 01:46:44,384
in.
Right.

2532
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:45,201
And you know,
people are like,

2533
01:46:45,201 --> 01:46:46,220
what?
What are you doing?

2534
01:46:46,221 --> 01:46:47,210
Where are you going?
And he's like,

2535
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:49,620
what I'm doing just stop.
I know what I'm stop.

2536
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,720
He knows what he's doing and he's knows
what he's doing.

2537
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:54,720
It's like for me,
having known him since he was an open

2538
01:46:54,721 --> 01:46:56,040
miker yeah,
there's a lot.

2539
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:56,860
You've really seen it.

2540
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:59,470
You've known him.
You've known him in a way that I don't

2541
01:46:59,471 --> 01:47:00,540
know him.
Like he,

2542
01:47:00,550 --> 01:47:02,710
when we were talking about you one time
in front of his apartment,

2543
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:04,120
those are the best,
you know,

2544
01:47:04,121 --> 01:47:06,490
that we've had them too.
When you go to take someone home and you

2545
01:47:06,491 --> 01:47:08,410
drop him off front of their house,
but you sit and talk for 10 more

2546
01:47:08,411 --> 01:47:10,260
minutes,
you got one with bill burr that I,

2547
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:14,050
I wish I had great.
But Ari dropped me off and he was like,

2548
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:15,190
oh,
we're talking about,

2549
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,830
we were just talking about intimacy
levels.

2550
01:47:17,831 --> 01:47:19,660
Like,
this is gonna sound silly and I'm not

2551
01:47:19,661 --> 01:47:20,980
going to call Ari galper.
I'll say,

2552
01:47:21,010 --> 01:47:25,690
this is what we're talking about.
We were talking about like how much we

2553
01:47:25,691 --> 01:47:27,130
were talking about you and then,
uh,

2554
01:47:27,970 --> 01:47:29,170
and I said something like,
well,

2555
01:47:29,171 --> 01:47:30,280
I texted him yesterday,
I feel bad.

2556
01:47:30,281 --> 01:47:30,910
Texted him again.

2557
01:47:30,910 --> 01:47:31,630
And he goes,
oh,

2558
01:47:31,630 --> 01:47:33,010
I don't want to text them too much
either.

2559
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:33,851
And I said,
yeah,

2560
01:47:33,851 --> 01:47:35,560
but he's our friend.
We should be able to text them the way

2561
01:47:35,561 --> 01:47:36,520
we text each other.
And he goes,

2562
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:37,900
I know,
but I don't want to like,

2563
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:39,190
I don't want to bother him.
And I go,

2564
01:47:39,191 --> 01:47:41,170
yeah,
but he'd do it to us and went and we

2565
01:47:41,171 --> 01:47:41,501
were like,
yeah,

2566
01:47:41,501 --> 01:47:43,210
we're having this really kind of crazy
conversation.

2567
01:47:43,211 --> 01:47:45,570
And I realized Ari and I are like the,
the,

2568
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:45,861
the,
the,

2569
01:47:45,861 --> 01:47:47,800
those moments in life are like so
precious.

2570
01:47:47,801 --> 01:47:50,020
But the F I don't know where the fuck
this story was going.

2571
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:52,180
How come you guys are secured?
Text me.

2572
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:55,000
We're just going to text like bill.
I do at the same bill.

2573
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:57,130
The tax bill.
Yeah.

2574
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,440
I'm scared of follow up.
Like I text bill,

2575
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:02,500
I'll text him right now.
I'll text him right now and either he

2576
01:48:02,501 --> 01:48:04,830
replies and like a day and a day.

2577
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,353
No,
no,

2578
01:48:06,910 --> 01:48:09,550
there's got the,
this is going to sound Tommy back me up

2579
01:48:09,551 --> 01:48:10,780

Back up on I will.

2580
01:48:11,410 --> 01:48:12,280
But like,
but like,

2581
01:48:12,670 --> 01:48:14,200
like I text bill,
hey man,

2582
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:17,170
you know,
are we doing this thing on Monday?

2583
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:18,660
And then he doesn't get,
I don't get her piling up.

2584
01:48:18,661 --> 01:48:20,770
I'm not gonna fuck her mother room.
I did this because I know he's got a lot

2585
01:48:20,771 --> 01:48:22,520
of shit going on.
And I go and I,

2586
01:48:22,521 --> 01:48:24,040
and I,
I have shit going on too.

2587
01:48:24,041 --> 01:48:24,930
But trust me,
it like,

2588
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:28,630
and you guys know like if you are you or
are your joey or bill or any of you guys

2589
01:48:28,631 --> 01:48:30,190
texted me,
these are my first reply.

2590
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:31,110
Like yeah,
go.

2591
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:32,140
Oh Yup.
Right on it.

2592
01:48:32,170 --> 01:48:34,000
Like you can see my bubble come up in
the bottom

2593
01:48:34,330 --> 01:48:36,400
before you're done typing.
Yeah.

2594
01:48:36,401 --> 01:48:37,780
It's a weird requirement,
right?

2595
01:48:37,781 --> 01:48:40,990
Like there's times where in more so
lately than ever that I've been just

2596
01:48:40,991 --> 01:48:44,950
putting my phone and like I'll put it in
the other room and I just leave it alone

2597
01:48:44,951 --> 01:48:45,860
for hours.
Yeah.

2598
01:48:46,030 --> 01:48:49,030
I think that that's,
that's not a bad thing to do,

2599
01:48:49,031 --> 01:48:49,870
man.
You know,

2600
01:48:49,871 --> 01:48:53,350
like everybody checks their phone during
podcasts and everybody checks their

2601
01:48:53,351 --> 01:48:55,430
phone during the movies.
How much?

2602
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:56,673
Yeah.
Well,

2603
01:48:56,680 --> 01:49:00,040
I mean we should do,
we should do it at one.

2604
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:01,930
Oh,
you don't wanna turn that beard yet.

2605
01:49:02,050 --> 01:49:03,160
We're going to do it.
You want to do it now?

2606
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:04,330
You want to do it on the air,
I think.

2607
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:04,990
Yeah.
No,

2608
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:06,250
we're definitely doing it on the air.
Okay.

2609
01:49:06,251 --> 01:49:07,960
Do you want to trim his beard?
Definitely.

2610
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:08,410
Yeah.
Okay.

2611
01:49:08,410 --> 01:49:12,820
But you got to sit sidesaddle on me.
That's the only gonna to take about 10

2612
01:49:12,821 --> 01:49:14,500
15 minutes.
So we'll wait til the end.

2613
01:49:14,501 --> 01:49:15,334
We'll wrap it up.

2614
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:16,250
Wrap it up.
Yeah,

2615
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:17,350
keep people here.
Tell you,

2616
01:49:17,351 --> 01:49:19,810
I'm wrapping up my daughters.
Did you see the videos my daughters did

2617
01:49:19,811 --> 01:49:21,220
on instagram?
No.

2618
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:22,870
I go,
I said something.

2619
01:49:22,871 --> 01:49:23,704
I go,
uh,

2620
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:24,790
hey,
give me a kiss on the cheek.

2621
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:27,850
I wouldn't kiss me on the cheek.
She was just fucking mad dog me.

2622
01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:28,571
I'm like,
well,

2623
01:49:28,571 --> 01:49:30,080
I to give me a kiss on the cheek does
last cheek.

2624
01:49:30,110 --> 01:49:32,200
You might get a kiss of the beard.
And she goes,

2625
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:33,340
it gives it to me.
She goes,

2626
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:34,060
oh,
it's wet.

2627
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:36,250
And then Georgia comes in and then goes
kiss on the cheek.

2628
01:49:36,790 --> 01:49:38,350
And then I go,
do you guys think I'm going to win

2629
01:49:38,351 --> 01:49:38,951
today?
And they went,

2630
01:49:38,951 --> 01:49:41,710
nope.
So you serious?

2631
01:49:41,711 --> 01:49:42,580
And they said,
nope.

2632
01:49:43,210 --> 01:49:45,280
And I was like,
are you ready guys ready to see me

2633
01:49:45,281 --> 01:49:46,240
without a beard?
And they're like,

2634
01:49:46,241 --> 01:49:48,130
nope.
They saw

2635
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:49,660
it.
They pull out all wet at my wedding

2636
01:49:49,661 --> 01:49:51,490
album,
me and Leanne and started looking

2637
01:49:51,491 --> 01:49:52,800
through pictures and they're like,
oh,

2638
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:55,240
we've got to get used to it.
You've got to give us some time.

2639
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,920
Wow.
That's so weird.

2640
01:49:56,921 --> 01:50:00,520
You're,
you're defined by your facial hair in a

2641
01:50:00,521 --> 01:50:02,200
weird way of do you want to keep it?
No.

2642
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:03,600
You let them keep no,
no.

2643
01:50:03,601 --> 01:50:04,331
Let him keep it.
Yeah,

2644
01:50:04,331 --> 01:50:04,770
yeah,
yeah.

2645
01:50:04,770 --> 01:50:05,790
I really,
well,

2646
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,030
you got to let them off the hook.
Oh,

2647
01:50:07,031 --> 01:50:09,160
a hundred percent hold on.
I can't do that.

2648
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:11,400
I'm not a wheelchair.
It's not watching.

2649
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:13,320
If the guy lets you off the hook,
that would let you off doug,

2650
01:50:13,330 --> 01:50:14,380
if you want to keep it.
No,

2651
01:50:14,381 --> 01:50:15,080
I can't.
I,

2652
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:17,430
I can't never mind by the way.
By the way.

2653
01:50:17,450 --> 01:50:18,910
It was definitely,
this is in Russia.

2654
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:21,880
In Russia.
Where does it get this picture?

2655
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:23,920
Is this one,
this machine thread?

2656
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:25,150
This is,
this is in Russia.

2657
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:26,500
Look,
I'm wearing an ato shirt.

2658
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,480
Oh my God.
It's like the second picture that pops

2659
01:50:28,481 --> 01:50:30,040
up.
Are you fucking serious?

2660
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:32,860
You're pushing the stomach out.
It's so small then.

2661
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:34,180
Dude.
You're tiny.

2662
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:36,040
You look like you weigh about two 10 by
the way,

2663
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:37,000
Joe.
What am I rocking?

2664
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:40,720
Lower that lower that Jamie.
Lower that a fucking fanny pack power.

2665
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:43,690
All you motherfuckers that have seen me
do stand up and I said when I met Igor

2666
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:46,000
and his door,
I was wearing a purple kelty fanny pack.

2667
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:49,360
That's the fucking panty fanny pack.
And it's the small details that make a

2668
01:50:49,361 --> 01:50:51,220
story and that's a fucking bolts good in
my pocket.

2669
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,720
It's not cool.
It's a what?

2670
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:54,430
A Baltika.
That's their local beer in St

2671
01:50:54,450 --> 01:50:55,500
Petersburg.
Beard.

2672
01:50:55,510 --> 01:50:56,770
Your body.
Yeah,

2673
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:59,290
that's,
is that purple or is that like a bluish

2674
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:01,030
purple Kelsey fanny pack.

2675
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:02,590
That was the best.
If I could go back,

2676
01:51:02,650 --> 01:51:05,170
if I could find that fanny pack,
I'd wear it everyday of my life.

2677
01:51:05,171 --> 01:51:08,790
It was the best fanny pack of her head.
Cause the way they made it was that it,

2678
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,610
the top part was flat.
You know,

2679
01:51:10,611 --> 01:51:12,610
it's what went out like a solid three
inches.

2680
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,960
So you rest your beer on that?
No,

2681
01:51:13,961 --> 01:51:14,201
no,
no,

2682
01:51:14,201 --> 01:51:15,280
no.
So that when you opened it,

2683
01:51:15,281 --> 01:51:17,380
you were looking at like a portfolio of
your stuff.

2684
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:20,380
It wasn't slid in like another pocket.
Ooh,

2685
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:22,840
that was the great,
if anyone can find me that purple kelty

2686
01:51:22,841 --> 01:51:24,730
fanny pack.
See if,

2687
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:28,090
see if a young Jamie,
how do you get a minor?

2688
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:29,913
Hmm.

2689
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:31,641
Okay.
Yo,

2690
01:51:31,641 --> 01:51:35,420
you savage [inaudible] you can find all
the pictures of the Russian mafia.

2691
01:51:35,450 --> 01:51:37,610
What is this from?
Is this like an article about your last

2692
01:51:37,611 --> 01:51:40,130
show time special for a New York Post
from a long time.

2693
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:41,510
Oh,
so powerful.

2694
01:51:41,511 --> 01:51:43,280
That was when my book came out,
by the way,

2695
01:51:43,281 --> 01:51:45,350
by the way.
You want to hear what a dummy I am.

2696
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:50,120
I posed for that picture having no clue.
It was the fucking cover van wilder.

2697
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:52,100
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2698
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:53,560
I had no fucking clue.
Yeah.

2699
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:55,460
He was like,
and I was like,

2700
01:51:55,461 --> 01:51:58,310
so they asked you to dress like that and
you didn't know why they brought the

2701
01:51:58,311 --> 01:52:02,390
shit.
Did a photo shoot [inaudible] I had no

2702
01:52:02,391 --> 01:52:04,250
fucking clue.
That's weird.

2703
01:52:05,830 --> 01:52:06,663
Yeah.

2704
01:52:06,890 --> 01:52:09,000
Does he do the tongue party?
Did you ever see Van Wilder?

2705
01:52:09,890 --> 01:52:10,760
You ever see it?
No.

2706
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:12,080
Uh,
I don't remember.

2707
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,930
I really don't remember.
I may have you say hard to tell.

2708
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,910
What's that?
You look up whether or not I've seen it

2709
01:52:17,911 --> 01:52:19,250
and it's one of those movies like,
hmm.

2710
01:52:19,370 --> 01:52:22,790
I've never seen it.
I watched a Christmas vacation the other

2711
01:52:22,791 --> 01:52:24,400
day,
so dude,

2712
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,290
yeah.
That is a God damn funny movie still

2713
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:29,900
shitters full.
That's a good movie,

2714
01:52:29,901 --> 01:52:31,520
man.
It's a great fucking movie.

2715
01:52:31,550 --> 01:52:33,680
Yeah.
I mean it is a great movie,

2716
01:52:33,681 --> 01:52:34,910
but they may be saying it.
I'm like,

2717
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:38,210
it's like I really enjoyed it.
Would you like that one more time?

2718
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:39,470
Yeah,
yeah,

2719
01:52:39,470 --> 01:52:40,670
yeah.
Come on Tommy,

2720
01:52:40,850 --> 01:52:42,350
drink finish at [inaudible].
Tommy,

2721
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:43,760
Tommy,
come on.

2722
01:52:44,630 --> 01:52:46,190
Bird going,
dee.

2723
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:49,370
I love this feeling.
This could be an I.

2724
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:49,920
If,
if,

2725
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:50,960
if,
if I,

2726
01:52:51,410 --> 01:52:52,930
yeah,
I um,

2727
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:57,380
uh,
I've never seen been a wilder and I took

2728
01:52:57,381 --> 01:52:58,760
a meeting with their production company.

2729
01:52:58,790 --> 01:53:00,360
They brought me in to,
uh,

2730
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:03,170
to do a sitcom and they're like,
do you know they had my book in front of

2731
01:53:03,171 --> 01:53:04,004
me and they go,
do you know who I am?

2732
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:05,120
We are on when I was like,
no.

2733
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:08,060
And like we produce van wilder,
big fan of your work,

2734
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:09,410
wanting to do a sitcom.
And I was like,

2735
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:11,480
okay,
and then I'll give you ever seen it?

2736
01:53:11,481 --> 01:53:11,991
And they're like,
no,

2737
01:53:11,991 --> 01:53:13,160
and this is what they said.
They said,

2738
01:53:13,310 --> 01:53:14,840
well,
we should get Ryan Reynolds to come on

2739
01:53:14,841 --> 01:53:16,340
your podcasts and watch it live with
you.

2740
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:17,190
I was like,
Shit,

2741
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:18,830
because it's his production company.
He's black horse.

2742
01:53:18,831 --> 01:53:23,831
I think production companies on that,
that taste like barbecue.

2743
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:28,690
Is it why that last hit tasted like no.
Joe,

2744
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:29,533
Tommy,
he's yours now.

2745
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:30,393
Tommy's years.
Tommy,

2746
01:53:30,450 --> 01:53:32,100
it's yours.
Do you need me to hold you down until

2747
01:53:32,150 --> 01:53:33,790
you,
Tommy's good.

2748
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,350
I'm totally reasonable.
And his approach.

2749
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:39,320
Could we just cut off a fucking bender
bro?

2750
01:53:42,730 --> 01:53:45,470
You feel,
do you feel like you can release the

2751
01:53:45,471 --> 01:53:49,640
hounds now and dive back into the fold
with a vengeance simply with drugs and

2752
01:53:49,641 --> 01:53:51,770
alcohol for a little bit.
Yeah,

2753
01:53:51,771 --> 01:53:53,360
but like,
but not enough food.

2754
01:53:53,390 --> 01:53:53,841
I,
you know,

2755
01:53:53,841 --> 01:53:55,010
it's really crazy.
Is that,

2756
01:53:55,011 --> 01:53:57,410
um,
uh,

2757
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:58,340
I had,
uh,

2758
01:53:58,340 --> 01:53:59,450
I don't know.
I'm sure you felt it too,

2759
01:53:59,451 --> 01:54:02,060
cause I watched you eat it.
But like the second pizza pizza didn't

2760
01:54:02,061 --> 01:54:03,890
work well with me.
Like my body was,

2761
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:06,320
it was up in my throat and I was like,
Ooh.

2762
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:07,850
And I was like,
I was too,

2763
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:10,760
it's too much of everything at one time.
Did you feel the same way?

2764
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:11,630
Um,
I,

2765
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:13,100
yeah,
I don't feel good.

2766
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:15,560
I watched you.
I watched it cause you,

2767
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:17,960
cause you had to have the pizza.
Yeah.

2768
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:22,810
But the vodcast flowing.
I have a business meeting I'm going to

2769
01:54:22,811 --> 01:54:24,870
do great.
You're going,

2770
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:25,850
wait,
you're going to a meeting.

2771
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:27,860
I got a business meeting at four.
Oh,

2772
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:30,920
that's plenty of time.
My only be slightly buzzed.

2773
01:54:30,950 --> 01:54:33,890
I used to hear stories about chappelle
going into auditions.

2774
01:54:33,891 --> 01:54:36,650
Highest Fuck.
I wish I had that confidence.

2775
01:54:36,651 --> 01:54:37,401
You know,
part of me goes,

2776
01:54:37,401 --> 01:54:39,980
that's why he's so successful as he
didn't give a fuck.

2777
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:41,120
Yeah.
Oh for sure.

2778
01:54:41,450 --> 01:54:44,060
Yeah.
Well Dave is another example of a guy

2779
01:54:44,061 --> 01:54:47,000
just does things the way he wants to do
them and he knows,

2780
01:54:47,070 --> 01:54:49,670
he,
he realized after a while,

2781
01:54:49,671 --> 01:54:53,390
I guess when you're a guy like him or a
guy like Ari that it doesn't benefit you

2782
01:54:53,391 --> 01:54:55,970
to have people influence you and tell
you what to do.

2783
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,510
Just doesn't.
And all three of us are,

2784
01:54:58,530 --> 01:55:00,320
uh,
a great example of that.

2785
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:03,290
Like,
the best stuff I think that we've done

2786
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:05,600
is stuff that we've done online where
you just,

2787
01:55:05,630 --> 01:55:06,930
you're yourself.
Yeah.

2788
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,870
You know,
like your podcast with your wife,

2789
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:13,820
that that podcast is you guys being
super fucking silly together like you

2790
01:55:13,821 --> 01:55:16,580
always are.
And there's all this jeans,

2791
01:55:16,581 --> 01:55:21,080
mommy talk and it's fucking great.
And Dan would have never happened if

2792
01:55:21,081 --> 01:55:22,300
somebody,
you know,

2793
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:25,580
had the reigns to it.
If there was a bunch of people that were

2794
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:30,220
executive producers and comedy central
had like 10 people behind the scenes

2795
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:34,010
getting this Jean's comment,
what's high and tight?

2796
01:55:34,370 --> 01:55:37,290
What's high and tight and what do you
mean when you're glassing?

2797
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:41,390
When there's no reason for you to do it
other than it's funny to you.

2798
01:55:41,450 --> 01:55:42,500
That's it.
That's it.

2799
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:43,980
That's the only I tried to tell

2800
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,450
people I get,
I'm sure you get asked a lot.

2801
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:46,313
I get like

2802
01:55:46,970 --> 01:55:50,290
tons of emails.
Don't you get them from people go,

2803
01:55:50,410 --> 01:55:52,730
how should,
what should I do to start?

2804
01:55:53,210 --> 01:55:54,620
Oh yeah.
That's hilarious.

2805
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:57,710
Did you ever do that?
[inaudible] told me one time.

2806
01:55:58,130 --> 01:56:00,320
Did you ever remember you're developing
a sitcom?

2807
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:02,630
Yeah.
Did that ever happen or did it go away?

2808
01:56:03,050 --> 01:56:03,900
It went away.
Oh,

2809
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:06,500
can you please tell everyone what the
premise was?

2810
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:12,890
Uh,
I'm walking through Walmart and like

2811
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:16,690
fucking Richmond,
Virginia and Tom Calls me,

2812
01:56:16,730 --> 01:56:17,720
we're talking about sit,
calm,

2813
01:56:17,721 --> 01:56:18,554
talk,
and he goes,

2814
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,660
yeah,
I'm developing like real serious.

2815
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:23,780
Really?
What's your character?

2816
01:56:23,781 --> 01:56:24,614
And he goes,
me,

2817
01:56:24,770 --> 01:56:27,890
I'm a doctor.
You're a doctor.

2818
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:28,903
He goes,
yeah,

2819
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:30,300
fuck it.
Lots of it.

2820
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:31,910
I go,
you don't look like a doctor goes,

2821
01:56:32,090 --> 01:56:32,923
yeah,
I know.

2822
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:42,220
But there was a twist to it
after they graduated last in medicine.

2823
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:50,350
So he's like essentially a dumb doctor
Tom going scalpel.

2824
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:56,780
Not how it went.
I,

2825
01:56:56,830 --> 01:57:01,010
the idea of being a doctor was the best
prep is I've ever heard of a sitcom

2826
01:57:01,011 --> 01:57:02,850
ever.
My fucking last doctor.

2827
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:07,820
I could be a straight comedy,
but the look on your face,

2828
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:13,700
you don't know what's going on over.
I don't think I've ever,

2829
01:57:17,181 --> 01:57:21,710
how long did I laugh on the phone?
Really long and really hard to where I

2830
01:57:21,711 --> 01:57:23,150
was like,
I didn't know what I'd done.

2831
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:26,353
Yeah.

2832
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:28,490
Oh,
you've probably made me laugh harder

2833
01:57:28,491 --> 01:57:32,300
than anyone person that I know.
Really.

2834
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:36,710
100% I do feel like everything has to be
a contest.

2835
01:57:37,190 --> 01:57:38,090
Well,
I feel,

2836
01:57:38,091 --> 01:57:40,490
yeah,
I feel like number one,

2837
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:43,820
you know,
when we do even the burt stuff,

2838
01:57:44,350 --> 01:57:47,450
we do it to make you laugh.
I feel like there's a part of me that

2839
01:57:47,451 --> 01:57:50,360
wants to make you laugh all the time.
Seriously.

2840
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:53,420
There's parts,
I wish I could share them on this

2841
01:57:53,421 --> 01:57:56,120
podcast,
but there's times times the,

2842
01:57:56,121 --> 01:57:58,820
my favorite parts of Tom is when he is
like,

2843
01:57:59,330 --> 01:58:02,360
he's like this,
this the side liner that says the thing

2844
01:58:02,361 --> 01:58:04,350
like,
or is affected by something like a,

2845
01:58:04,390 --> 01:58:06,110
the only one I can think of it as a
very,

2846
01:58:06,111 --> 01:58:11,000
a very applicable as
we and Tom did,

2847
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:12,860
uh,
did when I shaved his tits,

2848
01:58:12,861 --> 01:58:15,860
we were in Honolulu doing Pearl Harbor.
And uh,

2849
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:18,830
the two things,
the two things they said to us that were

2850
01:58:18,831 --> 01:58:19,720
recollect,
we're like,

2851
01:58:19,810 --> 01:58:22,820
we remember don't make fun of the
Hawaiian people and if it's brown and it

2852
01:58:22,821 --> 01:58:23,654
moves,
kill it.

2853
01:58:23,970 --> 01:58:25,130
Yeah.
That was what they said.

2854
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:27,290
These are the,
if it's Brown and moves,

2855
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:30,260
kill it and don't make fun of the wine
people.

2856
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:32,540
So Tom goes up,
his first joke was,

2857
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:34,850
hey man,
I life here is slow.

2858
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:37,070
That's what they told me.
I didn't know they were talking about

2859
01:58:37,071 --> 01:58:39,200
the Hawaiians metabolisms.
Holy Shit.

2860
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:42,040
Fucking huge laugh.
But immediately it's

2861
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,900
off the like,
it's not,

2862
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:45,580
you're not allowed to say that gets
done.

2863
01:58:45,581 --> 01:58:49,570
A set kills comes back to me.
Russell Peters goes on stage and you can

2864
01:58:49,571 --> 01:58:53,530
hear the murmur in the crop and Tom does
dislike snidely wit lash,

2865
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:56,970
like giggling and he goes,
he's pretty,

2866
01:58:57,480 --> 01:59:02,480
he's thinking about killing and Russell
Peters does it set mediocre?

2867
01:59:02,531 --> 01:59:04,690
I would say at best and rustled murders
but,

2868
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:07,360
but it's because he's Brown.
And at that time they're saying it,

2869
01:59:07,361 --> 01:59:09,580
but Brad has been brown and they moved
kill it.

2870
01:59:10,030 --> 01:59:11,740
It's true.
It's true.

2871
01:59:11,741 --> 01:59:14,020
And then we had the number,
the,

2872
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:19,270
the show organizer was like,
you guys fucked this up bad.

2873
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:21,160
You remember?
Oh yes.

2874
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:23,410
And then he was like,
he was like,

2875
01:59:23,411 --> 01:59:28,411
I told you not to fucking make fun of
the local people.

2876
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:31,720
I told you not to.
I tell you to pg 13.

2877
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:32,853
You know what that means.

2878
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:35,210
I was not pg 13.
Uh,

2879
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:36,970
I told you,
he's like,

2880
01:59:36,971 --> 01:59:39,820
there's children and there's wives of
admirals here.

2881
01:59:40,250 --> 01:59:42,430
It the rundown of like how we had
fucked,

2882
01:59:42,490 --> 01:59:44,560
don't know everything.
Yeah.

2883
01:59:44,730 --> 01:59:46,450
Oh my God.
Russell Peters is the coolest fucking

2884
01:59:46,451 --> 01:59:48,250
guy to his testament.
He like,

2885
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:49,270
he was like,
whatever,

2886
01:59:49,650 --> 01:59:53,500
and just let people get to fuck.
Russell have a fuck in his gas tank.

2887
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:55,840
That's also completely empty.
He really,

2888
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:59,290
he does whatever he wants for sure.
Yeah,

2889
01:59:59,291 --> 02:00:01,590
he's awesome.
He's the best I would be.

2890
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:05,410
I would be like,
I need to have some Fox in my gas tank.

2891
02:00:05,411 --> 02:00:08,170
Do you remember,
you don't think you've been connected to

2892
02:00:08,171 --> 02:00:11,690
this idea that you need to for so long?
If I didn't have fucks with my gas,

2893
02:00:11,730 --> 02:00:14,500
I got
Gibson,

2894
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:20,500
Mel Gibson and his fucking Melbourne
house to a fucking fucking pop round

2895
02:00:20,501 --> 02:00:24,370
plate.
Do you remember the girl that was on the

2896
02:00:24,430 --> 02:00:29,320
tour of Pearl Harbor that wasn't like
with us necessarily?

2897
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:31,030
You're talking about?
Yeah,

2898
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:33,420
and so we were talking about Debra Lee.
Yeah.

2899
02:00:38,670 --> 02:00:42,460
Russell Peters was dating the dumbest
human being I've ever met.

2900
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:47,470
Mike Russell,
I'll call him right now.

2901
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:50,590
He knows.
Definitely not.

2902
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:52,680
He knows it that he,
no,

2903
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:54,850
he knows that.
And we've talked to me and Russel talked

2904
02:00:54,851 --> 02:00:55,920
about this,
all my podcasts,

2905
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:58,180
so it's fine.
Trust me.

2906
02:00:58,210 --> 02:01:00,490
Okay.
First thing before we even go on the

2907
02:01:00,491 --> 02:01:01,271
tour,
I,

2908
02:01:01,271 --> 02:01:03,760
she had a russell in front of,
it's just me,

2909
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:07,960
Tommy and push leann and me and Russell
and kimberly,

2910
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:12,100
kimberly and I say,
and then Russell's brother Clayton,

2911
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:14,780
who might be my favorite human being in
the world comes down.

2912
02:01:14,781 --> 02:01:16,300
So I'm,
I love his brother comes in and sits

2913
02:01:16,301 --> 02:01:17,470
down and I go,
oh,

2914
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:19,830
hey,
have you guys ever seen that Indian porn

2915
02:01:19,831 --> 02:01:20,530
star?
I don't know.

2916
02:01:20,530 --> 02:01:21,490
What's her name,
what's her name?

2917
02:01:21,550 --> 02:01:23,590
And all of a sudden everyone's faces
shot.

2918
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:25,830
And she's like,
are you talking about Syria?

2919
02:01:26,230 --> 02:01:27,250
They,
it was a shot.

2920
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:29,050
And then you're like,
she's so fucking hot.

2921
02:01:29,080 --> 02:01:32,140
She's the whole fucking hall kept
talking about how great this one,

2922
02:01:32,141 --> 02:01:34,300
I've never been attracted to anyone.
And this is the one that switched my

2923
02:01:34,301 --> 02:01:36,790
button.
And Russell and Clayton are going like

2924
02:01:36,791 --> 02:01:39,740
this.
Like they're laughing so hard.

2925
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:43,070
And then she goes,
he dated her and Sierra Leone is her

2926
02:01:43,071 --> 02:01:44,500
name that you're right.
Yeah.

2927
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:47,660
And then,
then the next day we went on the cruise,

2928
02:01:47,661 --> 02:01:48,470
the Pearl Harbor.
Go ahead.

2929
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:53,470
Tom were on this cruise and it's a very
kind of somber and serious and then he

2930
02:01:54,651 --> 02:01:58,640
goes in right now he's giving us the
tourist and Admiral Rear Admiral and

2931
02:01:58,641 --> 02:02:00,470
he's like,
we're on the approach here of where I

2932
02:02:00,471 --> 02:02:01,850
guess it's the Arizona,
isn't that right?

2933
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:03,500
That's underneath.
Yeah.

2934
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:05,960
And um,
and he goes,

2935
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:10,010
the Arizona is up here on the right and
then Denver Legos.

2936
02:02:10,290 --> 02:02:11,210
Are we going to go under

2937
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:16,290
and um,
we're in an open boat.

2938
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:17,550
Like on the

2939
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:18,860
tour.
It's a boat.

2940
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:20,480
Yeah.
It's just about like where are,

2941
02:02:20,481 --> 02:02:22,880
you can see the sky and stuff.
He thought it might turn into a

2942
02:02:22,881 --> 02:02:23,800
submarine.
Yes.

2943
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:27,250
That,
that just like an open air marine.

2944
02:02:27,330 --> 02:02:29,330
Like we were just going to get under
right now.

2945
02:02:29,470 --> 02:02:31,580
Right.
I'm going to press the button.

2946
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:35,030
And then by the way,
the best group of people to witness that

2947
02:02:35,031 --> 02:02:38,060
statement with his Russell Peters is has
his arm around her and he,

2948
02:02:38,061 --> 02:02:43,061
you watch his eyes go like leave it off.
And then comedy push are sitting right

2949
02:02:43,881 --> 02:02:45,860
next to her and pushes,
like stomping her feet going,

2950
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:47,060
Ooh,
she's serious.

2951
02:02:47,330 --> 02:02:52,190
And then Tom's going,
imagine someone thinking that technology

2952
02:02:52,191 --> 02:02:54,800
has reached a point where you could,
uh,

2953
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:57,350
be in a boat and all of sudden they
press a button on the roof,

2954
02:02:57,351 --> 02:02:59,310
comes over this boat and you dive
underwater.

2955
02:03:00,150 --> 02:03:01,040
Look out the window.

2956
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:05,180
Now the window that far off that you
think you're on a submarine because

2957
02:03:05,181 --> 02:03:06,500
they're all boats or submarines,
right?

2958
02:03:06,501 --> 02:03:07,490
Yeah,
they all go.

2959
02:03:07,850 --> 02:03:10,010
Why wouldn't you just go under the water
if you could?

2960
02:03:10,060 --> 02:03:15,060
By the way,
it was her first boat ever to get in the

2961
02:03:15,201 --> 02:03:17,220
fucking submarine.
How about,

2962
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:18,770
can you been to one?
No.

2963
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,480
Oh,
dude and Disneyland.

2964
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:24,330
Hanoch there's such close quarters.
Fucking oh man.

2965
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:25,640
Tell it.
Talk to me,

2966
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:26,930
Dude.
First of all,

2967
02:03:26,931 --> 02:03:27,860
Susie,
close the door.

2968
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:29,720
What did you do?
Where was it went down?

2969
02:03:29,780 --> 02:03:31,520
Uh,
109?

2970
02:03:31,550 --> 02:03:32,361
No.
Oh,

2971
02:03:32,361 --> 02:03:34,370
not too far,
but must have been a hundred feet.

2972
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:37,970
Hawaii went down.
What was it for?

2973
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:41,460
I was just floating in submarine for TV.
You're getting the submarine.

2974
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:42,633
The submarine.
Was it?

2975
02:03:42,710 --> 02:03:44,060
Uh,
I don't know man.

2976
02:03:44,070 --> 02:03:45,470
I'm,
I'm not good at details.

2977
02:03:45,471 --> 02:03:47,110
So it was like a submarine.
Yeah.

2978
02:03:47,140 --> 02:03:48,710
You get more submarines.
No,

2979
02:03:48,711 --> 02:03:50,860
I'm sure it was touristy.
Like Oh really?

2980
02:03:50,930 --> 02:03:51,291
Yeah.
Yeah.

2981
02:03:51,291 --> 02:03:54,350
But once you get in,
it was in a boat that turned into it or

2982
02:03:54,351 --> 02:03:56,600
was it just a submarine?
Wow.

2983
02:03:56,660 --> 02:03:58,880
Holy Shit.
But getting in there is very

2984
02:03:58,881 --> 02:04:00,070
claustrophobic.
Same high.

2985
02:04:00,071 --> 02:04:02,570
I'd imagine being into a like an f 14 or
something.

2986
02:04:02,571 --> 02:04:04,130
It'd be claustrophobic.
Same Shit.

2987
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:06,560
And uh,
you started going down and then you

2988
02:04:06,561 --> 02:04:08,450
realize like,
oh fuck,

2989
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:12,200
if something goes wrong,
everyone dies immediately.

2990
02:04:12,700 --> 02:04:13,040
Okay.

2991
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:14,600
There's no,
there's no like,

2992
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:17,060
there's no like exits.
There's no,

2993
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:18,800
they don't give you a speech at the
beginning and they just go,

2994
02:04:18,801 --> 02:04:20,420
everyone sit down.
Let's hope we do this.

2995
02:04:20,900 --> 02:04:22,940
You know,
it would be the craziest community in

2996
02:04:22,941 --> 02:04:26,480
the world.
What if you could build an underwater

2997
02:04:26,690 --> 02:04:29,360
under ocean city?
They got one.

2998
02:04:29,361 --> 02:04:30,260
I think like,
uh,

2999
02:04:30,290 --> 02:04:35,290
like a submarine city where you
literally build it into like you take a

3000
02:04:35,811 --> 02:04:38,120
train through the ocean.
Yeah.

3001
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:41,610
To the center of the ocean where you
have a city where you know you can't

3002
02:04:41,611 --> 02:04:45,870
survive if anything goes wrong and you
all live in this little thing where you

3003
02:04:45,871 --> 02:04:48,390
have to keep that train path though.
But because that's where the food and

3004
02:04:48,391 --> 02:04:51,150
air comes from.
That's the only way other than that here

3005
02:04:51,151 --> 02:04:54,900
in the denial,
supercharged life would be nice people

3006
02:04:54,970 --> 02:04:59,970
and be be freaking out.
It's true as a genius fucking idea

3007
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:05,130
sitting in the ocean thinking about the
fact that at any moment this could fuck

3008
02:05:05,131 --> 02:05:10,131
ups with this constant checks on all of
the tolerances of all the joints of the

3009
02:05:10,341 --> 02:05:14,580
ball for glass.
I love the Shin and you're just sitting

3010
02:05:14,581 --> 02:05:16,740
there just being nice to each other,
having Martinis,

3011
02:05:16,741 --> 02:05:17,250
Hey,
hi,

3012
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:18,690
I'm going to go to sleep.
You think you could sleep?

3013
02:05:18,691 --> 02:05:21,230
I don't know.
What about you every day he's like that.

3014
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:22,980
No,
and there's always enough air.

3015
02:05:23,010 --> 02:05:25,680
There's always enough fair and there's
always enough food as long as you keep

3016
02:05:25,681 --> 02:05:27,930
that train open.
But if anybody's unhappy,

3017
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:31,170
they just put a suicide vest on and go
running in the middle of that fucking

3018
02:05:31,171 --> 02:05:31,680
train.
Oh,

3019
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:33,670
that would happen.
How quickly the people,

3020
02:05:35,790 --> 02:05:36,720
how long would it last?

3021
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:37,231
No,
no,

3022
02:05:37,231 --> 02:05:39,210
no,
no dues was close off the blockage.

3023
02:05:39,211 --> 02:05:42,570
Big guys like fucking do.
We're just close off the boxes and go.

3024
02:05:42,630 --> 02:05:44,250
All right,
there's a tariff being paid.

3025
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:45,600
That's how it works.
Yeah.

3026
02:05:46,220 --> 02:05:47,690
Yeah Dude,
I did.

3027
02:05:47,691 --> 02:05:49,410
Is it,
but would that work today?

3028
02:05:49,650 --> 02:05:52,710
Would that word today?
Cause it used to work but it used to

3029
02:05:52,711 --> 02:05:56,010
work without communication.
I think the kind of communication that

3030
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:58,590
everybody has today with a smart phone,
you know,

3031
02:05:58,980 --> 02:06:00,630
I don't know if it would work the same
way.

3032
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:04,890
I don't think you'd be able to do that
the way you can a hundred years ago or

3033
02:06:04,891 --> 02:06:08,550
200 years ago.
You would have to have like a super

3034
02:06:08,551 --> 02:06:11,580
supportive community.
There's yelling and everybody would have

3035
02:06:11,581 --> 02:06:13,500
to be like treated equally.
Otherwise,

3036
02:06:13,501 --> 02:06:16,980
if there's any disparity whatsoever.
Also wanted to have to do is pluck and

3037
02:06:16,981 --> 02:06:20,350
point a gun at the wall and it would,
it wouldn't last.

3038
02:06:21,590 --> 02:06:22,520
Yes,
I'm

3039
02:06:24,910 --> 02:06:25,830
you.
I mean,

3040
02:06:25,831 --> 02:06:30,831
you wouldn't be,
I saw that.

3041
02:06:33,721 --> 02:06:36,150
I saw it in my,
in my imagination.

3042
02:06:36,151 --> 02:06:38,280
Some guys,
when you can see a joke over and over

3043
02:06:38,281 --> 02:06:39,001
your head,
you go,

3044
02:06:39,001 --> 02:06:42,180
oh,
I saw a guy with a wife beater on and a

3045
02:06:42,181 --> 02:06:44,570
fucking Clint Eastwood Magnum put it on
a wall.

3046
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:46,470
The joke I saw my head,

3047
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:49,180
it could never get out,
is we were on Catalina one night.

3048
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,490
We're moved my sisters and we're all
smoking pot.

3049
02:06:51,910 --> 02:06:53,800
And they said,
and there's buffalo that roam around

3050
02:06:53,801 --> 02:06:56,500
there.
And so I said,

3051
02:06:56,501 --> 02:06:59,800
why is there a buffalo here?
And then my buddy Chris Gillen goes,

3052
02:06:59,860 --> 02:07:00,580
oh,
uh,

3053
02:07:00,580 --> 02:07:02,380
back in the 30s,
the 20s,

3054
02:07:02,740 --> 02:07:05,800
the owner of the cubs owned them own
this island.

3055
02:07:05,801 --> 02:07:07,330
So he used to have spring training out
here.

3056
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:12,600
So he brought the buffalo out and my
sister goes for a scrimmage and I saw

3057
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:16,870
the owner coming out in a seer sucker
shoots seeing buffalo on one side and

3058
02:07:16,871 --> 02:07:17,860
the cubs working out.
He goes,

3059
02:07:17,861 --> 02:07:17,960
yeah,

3060
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:21,640
I met the fucking deem like,
and I could not stop laughing at that

3061
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:24,070
image of him going out like with a cigar
like,

3062
02:07:27,970 --> 02:07:30,530
but like when you can visualize it and
to the best,

3063
02:07:31,690 --> 02:07:32,740
oh,
hilarious.

3064
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:33,880
Tommy,
let's kill this vodka.

3065
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:35,170
Come on,
let's kill this vodka.

3066
02:07:35,230 --> 02:07:36,063
You're going,

3067
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:37,810
oh,
I'm going hard for Tommy.

3068
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:39,160
Congratulations Buddy.
Thanks.

3069
02:07:39,190 --> 02:07:40,023
Listen,
listen.

3070
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:43,020
I gotta be honest with you.
I,

3071
02:07:44,050 --> 02:07:47,290
I feel personally,
I can't enter a bet.

3072
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:49,310
No,
I didn't go home.

3073
02:07:49,330 --> 02:07:52,510
I didn't go soft today.
Now I went hard today I went really hard

3074
02:07:52,511 --> 02:07:54,580
on the treadmill and go hard and not to
shave your beard.

3075
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:55,593
Yeah.
Really?

3076
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:56,561
I mean it's here.
It's like,

3077
02:07:56,561 --> 02:07:57,341
I was like,
I was like,

3078
02:07:57,341 --> 02:07:58,720
that's the moment.
That's the moment.

3079
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:02,260
I Dunno.
I can't leave here without a beard.

3080
02:08:02,261 --> 02:08:03,670
I feel very guilty.
I feel like,

3081
02:08:03,671 --> 02:08:07,240
I feel like everyone that tuned in,
everyone that watched goes like,

3082
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:09,460
goes like a man doesn't really matter to
me.

3083
02:08:09,461 --> 02:08:12,250
But then part of me goes,
I don't know.

3084
02:08:12,310 --> 02:08:13,980
I'll leave it up to you guys.
Oh,

3085
02:08:13,990 --> 02:08:15,340
you're switching that now?
No,

3086
02:08:16,220 --> 02:08:16,630
no,
no.

3087
02:08:16,630 --> 02:08:19,960
I'm putting in your hands.
I don't you mean that you're not own it.

3088
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:21,820
You're not saying no.
You can share my beard.

3089
02:08:21,821 --> 02:08:22,601
I don't give a fuck.
No,

3090
02:08:22,601 --> 02:08:25,390
but you just said I'm putting it in your
hands now and that and then like I feel

3091
02:08:25,391 --> 02:08:26,160
guilty.
I,

3092
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:26,970
my,
my boss,

3093
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:28,600
my,
my book is,

3094
02:08:28,810 --> 02:08:32,410
I got to shave this beard in your book.
But I'm saying cause I would've said I

3095
02:08:32,430 --> 02:08:34,030
would've definitely shape yours.
Okay.

3096
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:35,680
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't have let you out.

3097
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:36,791
Okay.
Tommy,

3098
02:08:36,791 --> 02:08:38,350
how do you feel about this?
No,

3099
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:40,060
it's just interesting that he just had
a,

3100
02:08:40,140 --> 02:08:44,200
it feels like a change of the way he
feels about it all together because

3101
02:08:44,201 --> 02:08:45,940
about an hour ago,
what did I say?

3102
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:47,373
Oh,
you don't even remember

3103
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:55,390
how fucked up our,
we thank you for saying,

3104
02:08:57,260 --> 02:08:59,050
I mean I'm loading.
I'm Tommy,

3105
02:08:59,051 --> 02:09:01,270
let's kill this drink.
Let's just get a big sip.

3106
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:04,570
Come home.
You're the only one that's fucked up.

3107
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:06,250
Tommy is not,
oh yeah,

3108
02:09:06,251 --> 02:09:07,084
I forgot.

3109
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:10,900
Come on man.
We're on a wait a minute.

3110
02:09:10,950 --> 02:09:11,451
But you,
you,

3111
02:09:11,451 --> 02:09:13,180
you know about the extreme change that
just happened,

3112
02:09:13,181 --> 02:09:14,140
right?
I don't know.

3113
02:09:14,350 --> 02:09:16,750
Well,
there's a little bit of hedging,

3114
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:20,710
hedging going on.
I told you a while ago that you would

3115
02:09:20,711 --> 02:09:21,820
let me keep my beard.
I said,

3116
02:09:21,821 --> 02:09:22,660
if you want and you go,
oh,

3117
02:09:22,661 --> 02:09:24,700
absolutely not.
I think I'm definitely losing it.

3118
02:09:24,730 --> 02:09:26,860
But then now you brought it up as if to
say,

3119
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:28,690
I won't decide.
You decide.

3120
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:29,120
No,
no,

3121
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:32,170
no doubts about that.
What if we give you one of them crazy Fu

3122
02:09:32,170 --> 02:09:35,500
Manchu type motherfuckers all the way
down to the jowls.

3123
02:09:35,501 --> 02:09:36,810
We'll still get rid of the beard.
Well,

3124
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:39,180
let's give you some crazy.
I thought it was Hitler.

3125
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,640
We talked about that.
No,

3126
02:09:41,650 --> 02:09:42,430
no,
no.

3127
02:09:42,430 --> 02:09:45,140
Let's get
loose dash.

3128
02:09:46,450 --> 02:09:48,250
Let's give him some Wyatt earp type
shit.

3129
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:51,280
What about like a Puerto Rican beard?
I'm real thin.

3130
02:09:52,210 --> 02:09:55,270
Real thin.
That would almost be worse than shaving

3131
02:09:55,271 --> 02:09:57,100
it all off.
Far Worse.

3132
02:09:57,550 --> 02:10:00,340
Viewing that on the way she gave you a
prince.

3133
02:10:04,050 --> 02:10:07,360
I bet this kid,
this kid Carter,

3134
02:10:08,890 --> 02:10:11,260
we have read a season ramps tickets with
Carter Carter,

3135
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:13,540
Carter,
Carter,

3136
02:10:13,541 --> 02:10:15,070
Carter,
Carter grooves.

3137
02:10:15,220 --> 02:10:18,070
I should say.
It's 510 he's kid I was talking about

3138
02:10:18,071 --> 02:10:19,600
hangovers with the other day.
Okay.

3139
02:10:19,810 --> 02:10:24,190
So he bet me some stupid fucking bet.
And it was like if he,

3140
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:25,300
if,
if he won,

3141
02:10:25,380 --> 02:10:28,330
I had to give him 200 bucks,
but if I want I get to cut his hair.

3142
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:30,760
And so he was like,
oh,

3143
02:10:30,761 --> 02:10:32,770
I'll take it done.
Cause he thought he was gonna was about,

3144
02:10:32,771 --> 02:10:35,090
I think it's the Rams Seattle game and I
won.

3145
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:36,740
And so I got to cut his hair and I was
like,

3146
02:10:36,741 --> 02:10:38,900
I'm fucking your hair up and this is
part of Man Shit.

3147
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:41,030
He's 10 years old.
So I immediately,

3148
02:10:41,031 --> 02:10:43,870
I cut it to like fucking dumb and dumber
bangs,

3149
02:10:43,980 --> 02:10:46,970
right?
Everyone starts laughing and his dad

3150
02:10:46,971 --> 02:10:48,750
starts going,
you look like simple Jack.

3151
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:53,660
But then in a weird way he changes,
like he goes,

3152
02:10:53,661 --> 02:10:56,990
he starts getting embarrassed and then
the mom start coming in.

3153
02:10:57,080 --> 02:10:59,350
This is all boys out right now.
And then the mom said,

3154
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:00,021
hey,
don't worry.

3155
02:11:00,021 --> 02:11:00,831
It looks good.
It looks good.

3156
02:11:00,831 --> 02:11:02,240
And I go,
that's not the fucking bet.

3157
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:03,710
The bet isn't it?
It looks good.

3158
02:11:03,860 --> 02:11:05,630
The bed is,
it looks horrible.

3159
02:11:05,631 --> 02:11:07,610
That's why I didn't cut his hair.
I'm not going to cut his hair to give

3160
02:11:07,611 --> 02:11:11,090
them a free haircut,
but then as the part of the human part

3161
02:11:11,091 --> 02:11:12,830
of me goes,
I'm not going to fuck up a kid.

3162
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:16,670
I don't want to fucking burn him at 10 I
want to do the Puerto Rican beard.

3163
02:11:18,310 --> 02:11:19,190
I'm going to fuck you.
Shave it off

3164
02:11:23,990 --> 02:11:28,990
breads.
Tiles is here.

3165
02:11:50,690 --> 02:11:52,190
Beards.
Is that what that says?

3166
02:11:52,340 --> 02:11:56,030
Here's Macomeda beard when I do comedy
or this year.

3167
02:11:56,031 --> 02:11:57,740
Beard.
Shit's funny.

3168
02:11:58,380 --> 02:11:59,510
Oh,
fucking poor guy.

3169
02:11:59,690 --> 02:12:04,190
Oh,
the prince is beautiful and that's what

3170
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:06,980
people just listening have no idea why
we were laughing.

3171
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:09,560
This is fucking,
if you google,

3172
02:12:09,561 --> 02:12:11,210
what is the,
give me the black and white one.

3173
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:12,530
Jamie.
That profile one.

3174
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:14,240
It's from the cover of what happened.

3175
02:12:14,950 --> 02:12:19,950
W A T.
Ah,

3176
02:12:24,750 --> 02:12:29,100
it's bad.
Super sculpted and it's got like this

3177
02:12:29,101 --> 02:12:31,620
like almost like a race track curve to
it.

3178
02:12:31,621 --> 02:12:34,820
It's really weird.
It's the weirdest foot run the show.

3179
02:12:34,830 --> 02:12:38,100
But can we do like Puerto Rican Guy
Beard?

3180
02:12:38,670 --> 02:12:41,880
It's just a line Puerto Rican guy.
Beard.

3181
02:12:42,110 --> 02:12:42,943
Yeah.

3182
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:49,790
He must hurt it said Puerto Rican facial
hair.

3183
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:58,260
You're getting that.
This is my new favorite thing.

3184
02:12:59,100 --> 02:13:03,960
Google black being black
talkies.

3185
02:13:05,110 --> 02:13:08,080
It's a tiger.
He has a tiger print,

3186
02:13:09,190 --> 02:13:11,950
print beer.
It's very thin.

3187
02:13:12,040 --> 02:13:13,270
Oh my God.
It's golden.

3188
02:13:13,271 --> 02:13:15,150
Blacks is amazing.
Yeah.

3189
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:20,880
This dude has his hair bleached blonde
and died in the shape of leopards.

3190
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:22,740
Get on his beard.

3191
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:31,020
That was the closest I came to blacking
out.

3192
02:13:33,450 --> 02:13:36,210
I was laughing so hard I couldn't
breathe.

3193
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:40,680
Is that the guy bring backstreet boys
that like might've been the hardest.

3194
02:13:40,681 --> 02:13:43,790
That's pretty close,
but I want to give you that moment.

3195
02:13:44,230 --> 02:13:46,260
Even the hardest physically have ever
laid.

3196
02:13:46,370 --> 02:13:47,000
Yeah,
yeah,

3197
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:50,950
yeah.
MTV Tattoo on his neck.

3198
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:53,560
That is bonus.
Who is that?

3199
02:13:53,800 --> 02:13:54,633
He was in the backseat.

3200
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:57,080
That guy.
That guy riff raff was really good on

3201
02:13:57,081 --> 02:13:58,430
hot wings.
Did you see that Jamie?

3202
02:13:59,030 --> 02:14:01,760
He was a hotlink is a show where they
eat wings.

3203
02:14:02,170 --> 02:14:04,420
Played on that.
Did it right on it.

3204
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:06,270
Joey Diaz is coming up on it.
Thank you.

3205
02:14:06,730 --> 02:14:07,900
Do you want to do it?
Yeah,

3206
02:14:07,910 --> 02:14:08,570
I would do it.
Yeah.

3207
02:14:08,570 --> 02:14:08,960
The,
okay.

3208
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:10,940
I'll just talk to sean.
Sean Evans is the guy that does it,

3209
02:14:10,970 --> 02:14:14,840
so you just go on to get fucked up by
hot wings like an interview.

3210
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:16,010
Yeah,
they ask you some questions

3211
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:19,580
progressively more interesting question.
It's one of the questions to ask me.

3212
02:14:19,790 --> 02:14:23,000
The hottest wing was,
have you ever talked shit about comics?

3213
02:14:23,570 --> 02:14:25,310
And I was so fucking out of it.
I was like,

3214
02:14:26,300 --> 02:14:28,640
yeah,
I talked shit about Tj Miller and Pete

3215
02:14:28,640 --> 02:14:32,000
Holmes
and they were like,

3216
02:14:32,001 --> 02:14:32,691
really?
And I was like,

3217
02:14:32,691 --> 02:14:34,150
yeah,
I think I shit on crystal Leah,

3218
02:14:34,160 --> 02:14:36,300
but I didn't mean to.
And he's just like,

3219
02:14:36,770 --> 02:14:38,240
he's sweating,
you're sweating.

3220
02:14:38,241 --> 02:14:38,901
And they're like,
really?

3221
02:14:38,901 --> 02:14:39,620
And I was like,
yeah,

3222
02:14:39,620 --> 02:14:42,530
next question ma'am.
Your body goes into like,

3223
02:14:42,650 --> 02:14:45,260
it's a really great show.
Jodie is coming up.

3224
02:14:45,261 --> 02:14:50,261
So how much worse is dehydrating then?
Eating the hot wings for me are a little

3225
02:14:51,081 --> 02:14:52,370
bit euphoric.
I get it.

3226
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:53,930
I get into a place where I,
I,

3227
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:57,950
my brain shuts down and you start
becoming primal about it and I fucking

3228
02:14:57,951 --> 02:14:59,780
love it.
You started posting,

3229
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:02,120
what do you mean really?
You're the reason I put book

3230
02:15:02,540 --> 02:15:05,120
Jalapenos with every meal and Jalapenos
is one thing though.

3231
02:15:05,121 --> 02:15:07,400
But I consider Jalapenos to be fairly
mild.

3232
02:15:07,820 --> 02:15:08,900
Dude.
Honestly,

3233
02:15:08,901 --> 02:15:10,670
like there's,
there's some stuff that I,

3234
02:15:10,930 --> 02:15:13,970
these to be a place in Burbank,
not in Burbank and Cno called Chili my

3235
02:15:13,971 --> 02:15:15,110
soul.
Did you ever go there?

3236
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:16,550
No,
no baby.

3237
02:15:16,551 --> 02:15:18,620
I did.
Ari and I've talked about it.

3238
02:15:18,621 --> 02:15:20,000
We,
it's one of those things we over,

3239
02:15:20,001 --> 02:15:23,120
it's always made plans to go there but
we didn't go and then by the time we

3240
02:15:23,121 --> 02:15:27,320
wanted to go,
the guy had died and it was a specialty

3241
02:15:27,321 --> 02:15:32,321
Chili shop where they only sold Chili
and they sold extreme temperature.

3242
02:15:33,290 --> 02:15:38,210
Chile like insanity Chile where you
would have like a very mild Chili,

3243
02:15:38,211 --> 02:15:40,700
which is really enjoyable,
a little spicy.

3244
02:15:40,701 --> 02:15:45,020
And there was a whole taste grid from
like one to 10 and I had tried like a

3245
02:15:45,021 --> 02:15:49,910
seven and it was insane how hot it was.
And they would give you these little

3246
02:15:49,911 --> 02:15:51,700
scoops like uh,
like uh,

3247
02:15:51,890 --> 02:15:55,970
you know like if you would get like a
personal size little paper Cup and you

3248
02:15:55,971 --> 02:15:58,400
pump the fucking ketchup in it at the
Burger shop,

3249
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:02,540
you know those little paper Cup things,
they give you one of those with the

3250
02:16:02,541 --> 02:16:06,950
Chili and a tiny baby spoon and you put
it in your mouth and the fucking

3251
02:16:06,951 --> 02:16:11,150
temperature from like a nine would make
you immediately start hiccuping.

3252
02:16:11,810 --> 02:16:15,290
Snot flying out of your nose.
I mean flying.

3253
02:16:15,460 --> 02:16:18,100
But imagine if Bri yet,
imagine people talking to you during

3254
02:16:18,101 --> 02:16:21,370
that and you having to answer questions.
That's why the show is brilliant is

3255
02:16:21,371 --> 02:16:23,650
cause it that you are the most
vulnerable and you're like,

3256
02:16:23,830 --> 02:16:24,880
I dunno.
Fuck man,

3257
02:16:24,881 --> 02:16:26,920
whatever.
It's so good.

3258
02:16:26,921 --> 02:16:28,240
Why don't you do it?
Fuck that.

3259
02:16:28,300 --> 02:16:29,560
Come on.
No Man.

3260
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:31,420
Great on Joe.
I,

3261
02:16:31,570 --> 02:16:34,130
I'd rather know you don't want,
sure.

3262
02:16:34,150 --> 02:16:36,400
You don't want to go to Paris with this.
Definitely don't want to go to Paris

3263
02:16:36,401 --> 02:16:40,290
with you definitely know what if we
change the location of Paris where you

3264
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:41,230
want to go?
That's what I'm saying.

3265
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:43,300
Toronto and we'll get a cabin for a
weekend.

3266
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:45,460
Go hunting something weird.
No,

3267
02:16:45,461 --> 02:16:46,001
no.
Go hunting.

3268
02:16:46,001 --> 02:16:48,190
I've always wanted to kill someone for
real.

3269
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:48,851
Yeah,
Dude.

3270
02:16:48,851 --> 02:16:50,350
I've talked to Bailey for the,
I want to know the,

3271
02:16:50,950 --> 02:16:52,330
uh,
crime more than the time traveler's

3272
02:16:52,331 --> 02:16:54,210
wife.
But yeah,

3273
02:16:54,580 --> 02:16:58,090
I think I would like when you talk,
I heard the podcast where you talked

3274
02:16:58,091 --> 02:17:00,010
about this kill.
No,

3275
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:02,440
probably more like that one.
That was the first one.

3276
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:02,790
No,
no,

3277
02:17:02,790 --> 02:17:03,131
no,
no.

3278
02:17:03,131 --> 02:17:05,350
It's the one that didn't have the scruff
off his hair.

3279
02:17:05,410 --> 02:17:06,820
Oh,
but that one died like that.

3280
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:07,631
Yeah.
But no,

3281
02:17:07,631 --> 02:17:08,740
but no,
it's not that,

3282
02:17:08,741 --> 02:17:10,570
but it was that he didn't have the
scruff of his hair yet.

3283
02:17:10,870 --> 02:17:13,690
Really upset.
Scuff off his hair.

3284
02:17:13,810 --> 02:17:16,060
They grow new antlers every year.
I know,

3285
02:17:16,061 --> 02:17:18,970
but regardless,
I heard that as a Newbie,

3286
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:22,720
I heard you guys talk about it like it
was like a baby and my baby and I got

3287
02:17:22,721 --> 02:17:23,560
really emotional.
I was like,

3288
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:24,130
oh.
I was like,

3289
02:17:24,130 --> 02:17:26,380
oh no.
That's a big ass dear.

3290
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:27,970
Yeah.
I didn't know they grew them new every

3291
02:17:27,970 --> 02:17:29,550
year.
I actually brought that up a lot.

3292
02:17:29,590 --> 02:17:32,050
Most giant of giant deer.
They,

3293
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:35,470
their antlers fall off every year.
Even if it's like a nine year old deer.

3294
02:17:35,471 --> 02:17:39,010
What's like an impossibly old deer?
Every year their antlers fall off and

3295
02:17:39,011 --> 02:17:41,560
those antlers are actually bone,
which is really crazy.

3296
02:17:41,740 --> 02:17:43,990
I dude,
I didn't know until it really recently

3297
02:17:44,010 --> 02:17:46,420
decided to all these facts to random
people.

3298
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:51,760
They grow new bone every year and then
it falls off and they grow that stuff in

3299
02:17:52,181 --> 02:17:56,110
their head just so that they can fight
to the death over pussy.

3300
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:59,800
That's real.
That's really why they grow it.

3301
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:01,990
They,
they kill each other all the time.

3302
02:18:01,991 --> 02:18:05,170
We stumbled across a,
an elk that had been killed.

3303
02:18:05,830 --> 02:18:09,220
My Friend Cam stumble across one this
year and another friend of Mine,

3304
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:11,890
a stumble across one last year in
California.

3305
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:14,830
They had been killed by another one.
They just stab each other in the body

3306
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:17,680
and like puncture each other's lungs and
Shaman.

3307
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:19,750
They go to war.
I'm a fuck now.

3308
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:21,490
That's what then that's exactly what
happened.

3309
02:18:21,491 --> 02:18:25,330
That's why they grow those things.
Tom is one of the biggest ones always

3310
02:18:25,331 --> 02:18:28,960
dominate because they can stab you from
a further distance.

3311
02:18:29,110 --> 02:18:32,820
Like it's a benefit of having these
gigantic summary Norman,

3312
02:18:32,821 --> 02:18:34,510
so what's the benefit?
What's the benefit of,

3313
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:36,690
of like when people go,
I've got a 10 point dear.

3314
02:18:36,691 --> 02:18:38,170
Does that mean,
is that late in the season?

3315
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:39,131
No,
no,

3316
02:18:39,131 --> 02:18:39,520
no,
no.

3317
02:18:39,520 --> 02:18:41,380
It means it's an old,
mature,

3318
02:18:41,381 --> 02:18:44,260
smart,
dominant male that's probably been

3319
02:18:44,261 --> 02:18:47,650
dominating the area.
If you get a big deer with a lot of

3320
02:18:47,651 --> 02:18:49,660
Antler,
those are the ones that have the bigger

3321
02:18:49,661 --> 02:18:53,470
deers and those are the ones that are
most dominant in terms of like spreading

3322
02:18:53,471 --> 02:18:54,161
their genes.
Yeah.

3323
02:18:54,161 --> 02:18:55,150
Let's go hunting.
Tom,

3324
02:18:56,110 --> 02:18:57,850
let's go on.
A lot of times the,

3325
02:18:57,851 --> 02:19:01,240
the,
the idea behind the conservation angle

3326
02:19:01,241 --> 02:19:05,320
is that if you hunt an animal like that,
you're hunting an animal that's already

3327
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:07,830
long spread its genetics,
so it's,

3328
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:10,030
there's no danger of losing its
genetics.

3329
02:19:10,270 --> 02:19:14,560
Its genetics have been spread and it's
actually better for the biodiversity of

3330
02:19:14,561 --> 02:19:16,810
the environment.
If you let the younger bucks start

3331
02:19:16,811 --> 02:19:20,020
breeding now as well.
That's super highly debated though

3332
02:19:20,550 --> 02:19:23,050
because a,
some key conservationists feel like

3333
02:19:23,070 --> 02:19:25,120
you're,
you're better off leaving them in there

3334
02:19:25,121 --> 02:19:26,710
as long as they survive.
It's,

3335
02:19:26,711 --> 02:19:28,180
it's,
it's a very controversial,

3336
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:31,260
hunters tend to think that the idea is
that if the,

3337
02:19:31,261 --> 02:19:31,940
you,
uh,

3338
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:32,773
can,
uh,

3339
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:36,080
get them out of the food chain,
the younger bucks,

3340
02:19:36,081 --> 02:19:38,210
we'll have a chance to rise up,
become dominant.

3341
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:40,580
I don't want to do it.
I don't want to go,

3342
02:19:40,890 --> 02:19:41,870
what is it?
Tense?

3343
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:43,790
I just don't want to,
I don't want to do something you enjoy.

3344
02:19:43,791 --> 02:19:48,470
I want to do something that
Cameron Hanes ultra marathon now that

3345
02:19:48,471 --> 02:19:52,430
don't want to do that furthest in.
Cameron Hanes is ultra marathon.

3346
02:19:52,610 --> 02:19:54,080
That's what you want to try and meet you
and Ari.

3347
02:19:54,590 --> 02:19:56,540
Oh my God.
He's got knee surgery.

3348
02:19:56,541 --> 02:19:57,920
He's not going to do that.
He's not stupid.

3349
02:19:58,070 --> 02:19:58,930
Okay,
let's do it.

3350
02:19:58,960 --> 02:19:59,750
Let's,
let's,

3351
02:19:59,750 --> 02:20:01,960
what's our next contest?
We have to another kind of art,

3352
02:20:03,150 --> 02:20:07,520
but art is integrity on this contest
because he's definitely a marathon is

3353
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:08,900
what makes it the funniest.
Yeah.

3354
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:10,850
If it was real spinning out,
I would agree with you.

3355
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:15,650
It's obviously for comedic effect.
I know Ari very well

3356
02:20:17,490 --> 02:20:20,540
and honestly,
in terms of like the fairness of the

3357
02:20:20,541 --> 02:20:23,120
competition,
I benefited from this thing more than

3358
02:20:23,121 --> 02:20:24,620
anybody.
I didn't have to lose any weight.

3359
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:26,570
I had two awesome podcasts with you
guys.

3360
02:20:27,020 --> 02:20:28,370
By all rights.
I should pay for it.

3361
02:20:28,610 --> 02:20:30,620
This has been a fun.
So let's figure out what to do.

3362
02:20:31,010 --> 02:20:32,600
What do you guys want to do?
You still want to go to Paris?

3363
02:20:32,870 --> 02:20:35,120
I could do whatever.
I could do something else.

3364
02:20:35,210 --> 02:20:37,340
Whatever you want to do.
Let's figure out what you want to do.

3365
02:20:37,930 --> 02:20:39,560
What you want to do and let's do it.
Okay?

3366
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,200
Nobody,
we need to get on this right now and put

3367
02:20:42,201 --> 02:20:43,870
it in stone right now.
Yeah.

3368
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:45,710
Why does it have to be bad?
Like wine?

3369
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:48,320
I've had a lot of girls say they want to
go home with me and then went to go

3370
02:20:48,321 --> 02:20:48,920
stand by the door.

3371
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:50,300
They're not there anymore.
Okay.

3372
02:20:50,920 --> 02:20:51,753
We gotta do this.
Me,

3373
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:52,321
you,
me,

3374
02:20:52,321 --> 02:20:52,621
you,
Joe.

3375
02:20:52,621 --> 02:20:54,620
And is not going to make you take them
on a trip.

3376
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:56,960
Who Do rd.
I mean,

3377
02:20:57,450 --> 02:20:58,280
where are you?
I mean,

3378
02:20:58,280 --> 02:21:00,440
I'm saying anybody like,
you know what I'm saying?

3379
02:21:00,441 --> 02:21:01,520
Like what?
Why do you,

3380
02:21:01,521 --> 02:21:03,100
why do you think,
do you have to lock it down?

3381
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:04,160
I want to find something.
I want to,

3382
02:21:04,161 --> 02:21:06,860
I want to continue this bet continued.
Oh,

3383
02:21:06,930 --> 02:21:08,960
you want to take it to another point?
If you're doing next level.

3384
02:21:08,990 --> 02:21:10,130
Oh,
I see.

3385
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:10,850
Oh,
I see.

3386
02:21:10,850 --> 02:21:11,990
It's not going to be,
no,

3387
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:13,220
not even a day off,
bro.

3388
02:21:13,540 --> 02:21:14,373
Right back.
What do you mean?

3389
02:21:14,690 --> 02:21:16,010
Because you know what man,
it gives you,

3390
02:21:16,011 --> 02:21:18,050
it gives you focus and you're right.
It does,

3391
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:20,690
it does.
It gives you focus and I enjoy it gives

3392
02:21:20,691 --> 02:21:22,970
you something to look forward to.
Like taking the girls to London.

3393
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:25,040
Like I was really bummed out about
Christmas.

3394
02:21:25,070 --> 02:21:28,590
And then Christmas Eve I went how by
assault trip just to night.

3395
02:21:28,630 --> 02:21:31,310
Like we're too comfortable with a lack
of competition and aren't we?

3396
02:21:31,540 --> 02:21:33,710
Yeah.
Like you guys get sharpened by this

3397
02:21:33,711 --> 02:21:34,950
experience.
I think so.

3398
02:21:35,090 --> 02:21:38,470
I'm a better Bert.
Bert Better Bert.

3399
02:21:39,070 --> 02:21:42,620
Got The name of my tour
tours.

3400
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:45,230
I never named a fucking tour.
Talk to old.

3401
02:21:45,240 --> 02:21:46,640
No teeth,
no fucking access.

3402
02:21:50,370 --> 02:21:51,070
Ah,
by

3403
02:21:51,070 --> 02:21:51,890
the way,
by the way,

3404
02:21:51,890 --> 02:21:55,180
you goes.
Last night I did a,

3405
02:21:55,300 --> 02:21:58,340
Joey was a Nosha oh.
For the podcast.

3406
02:21:58,341 --> 02:22:01,310
So I was hoping he would kind of put
some weight on you until he was,

3407
02:22:02,030 --> 02:22:04,520
I saw him,
I saw him,

3408
02:22:05,950 --> 02:22:08,770
I saw him on his podcast and he was so
high that,

3409
02:22:08,771 --> 02:22:10,240
you know,
we very seldomly when,

3410
02:22:10,241 --> 02:22:11,290
you know,
when Joey's high,

3411
02:22:11,291 --> 02:22:15,630
when he starts doing stuff like this
and he'd just swallow.

3412
02:22:15,631 --> 02:22:20,631
He goes,
he just caught a rat in his hand at

3413
02:22:22,031 --> 02:22:22,841
eight o'clock.
I was like,

3414
02:22:22,841 --> 02:22:23,790
he's not making it.
Yeah.

3415
02:22:25,010 --> 02:22:26,160
O and P it was,

3416
02:22:26,230 --> 02:22:26,911
uh,
it was,

3417
02:22:26,911 --> 02:22:29,160
it was a great podcast.
Joey's Parkinson's was great last night,

3418
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:31,560
but I watched it live and I was like,
he's not coming over.

3419
02:22:31,561 --> 02:22:32,221
So I was like,
Leon,

3420
02:22:32,221 --> 02:22:34,020
let's do a box.
He did.

3421
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:36,750
So he did a podcast with Leanne last
night and,

3422
02:22:36,751 --> 02:22:38,760
uh,
halfway through she goes,

3423
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,350
I had to edit it out.
She goes,

3424
02:22:41,310 --> 02:22:42,420
oh,
is this,

3425
02:22:42,421 --> 02:22:43,710
is this good?
And I was like,

3426
02:22:43,860 --> 02:22:46,110
I don't know podcasts with guys and
girls,

3427
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:48,750
like a comedian and his wife has aren't
never funny.

3428
02:22:48,900 --> 02:22:49,930
And then she goes,
what about Tom?

3429
02:22:49,931 --> 02:22:50,764
I push,
I go,

3430
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:51,850
it's fucking different.

3431
02:22:51,850 --> 02:22:53,570
And they shoot it,
edit it out,

3432
02:22:53,571 --> 02:22:54,640
and she goes,
oh,

3433
02:22:54,641 --> 02:22:55,720
it's fucking different.
Huh?

3434
02:22:55,810 --> 02:22:57,130
I'm like,
wow,

3435
02:22:57,640 --> 02:23:00,870
but she's pushes a comic.
It's different power from birth.

3436
02:23:01,010 --> 02:23:06,010
You're thrown his wife under the bus.
That's what it sounds like.

3437
02:23:06,611 --> 02:23:08,740
You're totally in and the boss.
Oh,

3438
02:23:08,741 --> 02:23:13,400
it's fantastic.
Isn't that right guys?

3439
02:23:13,420 --> 02:23:16,480
You are amazing.
You probably won't have time for a one,

3440
02:23:16,481 --> 02:23:17,260
two,
three,

3441
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:19,090
three waters.
Oh my God.

3442
02:23:19,091 --> 02:23:22,660
Two of those three bottles of water to
have those gigantic two oh,

3443
02:23:22,661 --> 02:23:25,430
coconut cans.
I've had half this handle and I've had,

3444
02:23:26,020 --> 02:23:27,090
I've had a drinking.
Wow.

3445
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:29,360
Two of these.
I shouldn't even care man.

3446
02:23:29,390 --> 02:23:31,100
I tell you what,
it really would kind of made me

3447
02:23:31,101 --> 02:23:33,080
appreciate water.
I know.

3448
02:23:33,140 --> 02:23:34,770
I really appreciate water.
Like meaning like,

3449
02:23:35,360 --> 02:23:37,490
like I was like,
you know you said that water damn shit.

3450
02:23:37,491 --> 02:23:38,540
And I was like,
I never got it.

3451
02:23:38,541 --> 02:23:39,290
Really.
I was like,

3452
02:23:39,290 --> 02:23:39,801
I was like,
oh yeah,

3453
02:23:39,801 --> 02:23:41,210
water tip.
Like I was like,

3454
02:23:41,211 --> 02:23:42,770
I didn't,
I didn't find him to get a competition

3455
02:23:42,771 --> 02:23:43,920
for us.
No,

3456
02:23:44,390 --> 02:23:49,390
but now
let's do the volunteer jam and that's

3457
02:23:49,881 --> 02:23:52,310
not fair.
Giant leg up

3458
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:55,960
for what I love you.
Okay,

3459
02:23:58,230 --> 02:24:01,070
let's take a big step.
What topic?

3460
02:24:04,330 --> 02:24:06,100
He goes out of his debit card.
About time.

3461
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:14,160
This could be a co a show that's a
contest between youtube every month.

3462
02:24:14,891 --> 02:24:17,020
Could be the greatest show the world has
ever known.

3463
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:21,730
I would pick a pitch up beat.
Did you should someone has to develop it

3464
02:24:21,731 --> 02:24:23,620
for online.
That's what it should be.

3465
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:25,970
Yeah,
it should be online because that's what

3466
02:24:25,980 --> 02:24:27,260
we could do it.
Yeah,

3467
02:24:27,290 --> 02:24:30,280
forget all this nonsense.
Trying to explain it to people that give

3468
02:24:30,281 --> 02:24:33,550
you money and put cameras on it.
You don't have to do that anymore.

3469
02:24:33,551 --> 02:24:35,830
And not,
not that you've ever had bad

3470
02:24:35,831 --> 02:24:38,950
relationships with any of those people,
but you won't be able to smoke pot.

3471
02:24:38,980 --> 02:24:41,200
You won't be able to be honest.
You won't be able to talk.

3472
02:24:41,201 --> 02:24:43,870
You won't be able to swear.
You do it online.

3473
02:24:43,871 --> 02:24:47,140
You could just be you.
That's why podcasts are so fucking good.

3474
02:24:47,290 --> 02:24:50,020
But it is why podcasts are so good and
that's why people really know who you

3475
02:24:50,021 --> 02:24:51,370
are.
You know what I mean?

3476
02:24:51,430 --> 02:24:54,210
People know you from the travel channel
and they love you from standup,

3477
02:24:54,220 --> 02:24:57,330
but until you see you do you,
you,

3478
02:24:57,480 --> 02:24:58,313
you,
you,

3479
02:24:58,480 --> 02:25:01,090
you have the shots.
The thing was joint in.

3480
02:25:01,420 --> 02:25:04,300
We're all having fun.
You use to kind of dial back a little

3481
02:25:04,301 --> 02:25:05,134
bit.

3482
02:25:08,590 --> 02:25:12,250
This is that like,
and this was the defining turning me

3483
02:25:12,310 --> 02:25:15,550
where I'm at today was like all my
friends that you,

3484
02:25:15,630 --> 02:25:17,740
I'll just say I'll,
I would say specifically you,

3485
02:25:17,741 --> 02:25:21,440
Bill Burr and Tommy were all like a
drop.

3486
02:25:21,450 --> 02:25:24,160
So it was great.
But like you better stand

3487
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:26,410
up in your bedroom and you're better at
like being you.

3488
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:28,120
And it was like one of those things
where you go,

3489
02:25:28,150 --> 02:25:29,710
oh yeah,
maybe I am a better,

3490
02:25:29,711 --> 02:25:32,980
like maybe it,
that's the cool thing about the internet

3491
02:25:32,981 --> 02:25:34,660
is that I don't want to be like,
hi guys,

3492
02:25:34,661 --> 02:25:35,950
welcome.
I'm Bert Kreischer.

3493
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:37,870
Like I don't mind doing that for money.
But like,

3494
02:25:37,900 --> 02:25:41,170
well I'll tell you from someone who did
it for five years.

3495
02:25:41,171 --> 02:25:44,590
And so I did it alongside while you were
doing it too.

3496
02:25:44,591 --> 02:25:48,100
I know it's a really great job and your
jobs better than mine in terms of like

3497
02:25:48,101 --> 02:25:51,580
the fun event,
like the places you got to go rather

3498
02:25:51,581 --> 02:25:52,840
than a fear factor,
which is,

3499
02:25:52,841 --> 02:25:54,280
you know,
most of it was local.

3500
02:25:54,281 --> 02:25:56,130
Occasionally we traveled,
it's gotta be fun.

3501
02:25:56,140 --> 02:25:57,280
It was fun.
Crazy show.

3502
02:25:57,660 --> 02:25:58,600
No,
no doubt about it.

3503
02:25:58,601 --> 02:26:02,050
It was definitely a fun game,
but the difference between that and

3504
02:26:02,051 --> 02:26:04,930
standup is giant and if you don't,
if you don't give stand up,

3505
02:26:04,931 --> 02:26:07,750
the fucking respect it deserves,
it becomes dog shit.

3506
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:09,690
It just does.
It's,

3507
02:26:09,980 --> 02:26:14,290
it's just too hard to not,
it's too hard to not happen.

3508
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

3509
02:26:16,211 --> 02:26:18,220
You got to do it all the time to it all
the time.

3510
02:26:18,430 --> 02:26:21,190
You got to do it all the time and if
you're doing a gang of other shit on top

3511
02:26:21,191 --> 02:26:23,800
of it where it's where you can't do
standup for months at a time,

3512
02:26:23,801 --> 02:26:26,410
like you were doing your like to do it.
You're too funny though.

3513
02:26:26,411 --> 02:26:27,244
Right?
Rolling.

3514
02:26:27,340 --> 02:26:31,780
18 weeks straight on the road.
That's where it comes from.

3515
02:26:31,810 --> 02:26:33,850
We haven't named the tour technically
because I don't,

3516
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:36,100
I've never named a tour,
but how about that?

3517
02:26:36,130 --> 02:26:39,280
I have never named a tour.
I've never named tour Bert Kreischer.

3518
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:41,720
I have never named it to our perfect,
that's a great,

3519
02:26:41,770 --> 02:26:44,740
you can do one every year.
I've never named a tour to.

3520
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:48,100
I've never named a tour.
Three I really like about Alberto.

3521
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:52,450
The first one I ever saw that someone
named one was a jen Kirkman and she

3522
02:26:52,451 --> 02:26:53,680
named a tour and I was like,
oh,

3523
02:26:53,681 --> 02:26:55,900
fucking Badass.
I saw that and I was like,

3524
02:26:55,901 --> 02:26:58,420
the first one you ever saw it stay
offline.

3525
02:26:58,450 --> 02:27:00,690
Did you have a head injury?
The I ended up paying the text.

3526
02:27:04,060 --> 02:27:06,310
We've never seen it before.
I've never seen a person.

3527
02:27:06,311 --> 02:27:09,430
I take that back to punish your tour.
Punisher tour.

3528
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:13,390
What was the punisher door?
Kazia punished her tour was the first

3529
02:27:13,391 --> 02:27:16,360
one I heard that everyone like was
talking about the punisher.

3530
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:20,500
Punisher.
Well Griffin named his tours back in the

3531
02:27:20,501 --> 02:27:22,270
fucking 90 [inaudible].
What's up with Eddie Griffin?

3532
02:27:22,570 --> 02:27:23,920
I don't know.
I think he's doing that.

3533
02:27:23,921 --> 02:27:26,140
A tour with a,
who is it?

3534
02:27:26,310 --> 02:27:28,240
Like George Lopez,
George Lopez.

3535
02:27:28,241 --> 02:27:29,620
Eddie Griffith.
Cedric.

3536
02:27:29,621 --> 02:27:34,420
And who else is one other person?
Tell you something man.

3537
02:27:34,421 --> 02:27:37,010
I tell everybody there's been a few
sets.

3538
02:27:37,140 --> 02:27:42,140
Does it fit a few sets that I've seen
where you know there's people that catch

3539
02:27:42,581 --> 02:27:47,290
genius in a bottle man,
they just catch genius and it might be

3540
02:27:47,291 --> 02:27:49,270
only for a short amount of time in their
life.

3541
02:27:49,271 --> 02:27:51,190
It might be for a moment.
And I'm Oh Eddie,

3542
02:27:51,370 --> 02:27:54,640
Charlie Murphy's on it to dl Hughley
cedric the entertainer.

3543
02:27:54,830 --> 02:27:57,470
The JB smoove.
No Man,

3544
02:27:57,490 --> 02:27:59,830
this Charlie,
Charlie Murphy's on the pitch.

3545
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:03,910
So it's called the comedy get down,
but they catch,

3546
02:28:04,060 --> 02:28:06,430
they catch lightening in a bottle that
they nail it.

3547
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:09,010
And for Eddie Griffin there was a,
um,

3548
02:28:09,580 --> 02:28:12,550
what was that hbo suppose it Def Comedy
Jam.

3549
02:28:12,580 --> 02:28:15,010
Yes.
It was a def comedy jam special that

3550
02:28:15,011 --> 02:28:18,310
Eddie Griffin did and I,
I'm pretty sure he was wearing shorts.

3551
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:20,140
You're right,
he was,

3552
02:28:20,340 --> 02:28:21,110
he,
I know I,

3553
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:26,110
which one you're talking about?
He came out and he was so ex below sieve

3554
02:28:27,230 --> 02:28:29,960
with the way he just,
every punchline,

3555
02:28:29,961 --> 02:28:33,390
he was involved in a semi shirtless too,
wasn't it?

3556
02:28:33,410 --> 02:28:37,520
Like there was something going on.
Something was picking up a picture of

3557
02:28:37,521 --> 02:28:39,000
Jamie.
He was so,

3558
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:41,630
it was like the way he was moving there
was so much energy.

3559
02:28:41,660 --> 02:28:42,710
This is not it.
No,

3560
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:44,510
no.
It was another one that we said it's a

3561
02:28:44,510 --> 02:28:45,130
half hour special.

3562
02:28:45,130 --> 02:28:46,190
Yeah.
Is that what it was?

3563
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:48,110
That might've been,
I think you're right.

3564
02:28:48,111 --> 02:28:49,610
I think you're right.
It was an hbo.

3565
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:51,710
I think he did this and then he did
that.

3566
02:28:51,860 --> 02:28:53,120
Yeah.
Well anyway,

3567
02:28:53,150 --> 02:28:56,330
when he did that special,
whatever that special was,

3568
02:28:56,950 --> 02:28:59,900
when I watched parts of it,
I don't even know if I had,

3569
02:29:00,140 --> 02:29:04,220
I think I'd started doing stand up.
I was just like an open at time,

3570
02:29:04,221 --> 02:29:07,970
just Kinda just getting going.
And I remember thinking,

3571
02:29:07,971 --> 02:29:10,970
Holy Shit.
Like that guy just tapped into that

3572
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:15,530
weird rare spot where you could never
imagine yourself doing it.

3573
02:29:15,710 --> 02:29:17,000
I don't,
I don't know if that's it either,

3574
02:29:17,001 --> 02:29:19,370
man.
Is that what it says it is?

3575
02:29:22,190 --> 02:29:23,720
It might be it.
The colors look off,

3576
02:29:23,721 --> 02:29:25,540
but maybe it's just my memory.
He did food.

3577
02:29:25,541 --> 02:29:26,820
Who Child too?
I'm going off.

3578
02:29:26,850 --> 02:29:28,130
That was before this or no,
no,

3579
02:29:28,131 --> 02:29:29,900
no.
I'm pretty sure that was a later one.

3580
02:29:29,930 --> 02:29:31,340
But he's,
someone always had seen live.

3581
02:29:31,430 --> 02:29:32,870
Oh,
he's making Katt Williams.

3582
02:29:33,110 --> 02:29:33,831
Eddie.
So crazy.

3583
02:29:33,831 --> 02:29:37,100
He's a real nice guy though.
But I'm just saying like,

3584
02:29:37,340 --> 02:29:38,900
I wish I had,
I had been at the store when they were

3585
02:29:38,901 --> 02:29:40,580
at the store.
Bomag Eddie Griffin.

3586
02:29:41,180 --> 02:29:44,570
I've always got along with that guy.
He's a super nice guy about cat.

3587
02:29:44,990 --> 02:29:46,670
I don't know him.
I don't know.

3588
02:29:46,910 --> 02:29:49,730
I'm a big fan though because that's a
big fan of what he does.

3589
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:53,300
Can you do curiosity?
Do you not reach out to them to be on

3590
02:29:53,301 --> 02:29:54,620
your podcast?
No.

3591
02:29:54,621 --> 02:29:58,280
If I run into them,
I would love to love to see Kat Williams

3592
02:29:58,281 --> 02:29:59,480
and Eddie Griffin on your podcast.

3593
02:29:59,780 --> 02:30:02,480
But you know what man,
I would too if they were around like

3594
02:30:02,481 --> 02:30:03,740
it's,
it's a matter of like,

3595
02:30:03,830 --> 02:30:05,550
I don't want to bug anybody,
you know?

3596
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:08,180
Especially nobody that I like cat.
I don't even know.

3597
02:30:08,181 --> 02:30:10,130
And Eddie,
I've known forever,

3598
02:30:10,220 --> 02:30:11,840
like if he's around,
he ever wants to do it.

3599
02:30:11,841 --> 02:30:13,240
If I see him at the store or something
like that.

3600
02:30:13,290 --> 02:30:14,660
What about,
what about Chappelle?

3601
02:30:15,460 --> 02:30:17,690
I would love to do with Dave and we've
talked about it,

3602
02:30:17,691 --> 02:30:19,700
but we just never did it.
And it's one of those things were

3603
02:30:19,701 --> 02:30:21,560
awesome.
Dave is another guy,

3604
02:30:21,561 --> 02:30:24,040
like you don't want to,
you don't tell them time,

3605
02:30:24,050 --> 02:30:24,883
time,
damage.

3606
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:26,180
I texted him,
we talk,

3607
02:30:26,750 --> 02:30:29,330
but he's a,
he's a super unusual guy,

3608
02:30:29,331 --> 02:30:31,670
man.
He's just doing his own thing and if he

3609
02:30:31,671 --> 02:30:33,650
wanted to do it,
he would ask me and then he'd come and

3610
02:30:33,651 --> 02:30:34,910
do it and we never got,
hey joe,

3611
02:30:34,911 --> 02:30:35,680
let's do it.

3612
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:36,501
I'll be like,
fuck it.

3613
02:30:36,501 --> 02:30:38,090
Come on.
He's the only person.

3614
02:30:38,390 --> 02:30:40,790
He's,
he's the only person in the world that I

3615
02:30:40,791 --> 02:30:44,900
consider it the great white shark.
Meaning when he walks in a room as a

3616
02:30:44,901 --> 02:30:46,390
comic,
there's a weird energy where you're

3617
02:30:46,391 --> 02:30:48,040
like,
I should have stayed sprawl.

3618
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:48,781
Like,
yeah,

3619
02:30:48,781 --> 02:30:50,180
but that's for me,
me and Tom,

3620
02:30:50,210 --> 02:30:53,120
probably same age,
but like he walked into the room when I

3621
02:30:53,121 --> 02:30:55,940
was getting paid date in one night,
just walked into the room,

3622
02:30:56,330 --> 02:30:57,290
you don't what?
You can get your check.

3623
02:30:57,291 --> 02:30:59,750
It's like closed.
And he walked into the room and I just

3624
02:30:59,890 --> 02:31:00,890
added my car was like,
oh.

3625
02:31:00,891 --> 02:31:02,300
I was like,
oh my God.

3626
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:05,570
And I'm do not get uncomfortable around
famous people.

3627
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:09,890
But I was fucking shaking and I was like
doing like shit.

3628
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:12,950
You're embarrassed about where your
posted up a little bit outside the realm

3629
02:31:12,951 --> 02:31:14,540
of him going like where's everyone going
on it?

3630
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:15,693
Yeah.

3631
02:31:17,550 --> 02:31:19,140
But like,
did you know what was the headliner?

3632
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:21,070
I'm just burt.
I was was like,

3633
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:24,420
but he's one of those uh,
guys talk.

3634
02:31:24,690 --> 02:31:25,570
I never spoke to him.
Yeah.

3635
02:31:25,950 --> 02:31:27,260
And he lives around there.
Right.

3636
02:31:27,261 --> 02:31:30,420
And dates silver.
Rhea is that it's workout club where he

3637
02:31:30,421 --> 02:31:33,370
goes to fuck around anymore.
But they said he used to stop it.

3638
02:31:33,630 --> 02:31:36,300
Stop it all the time to do it anymore.
I don't think so.

3639
02:31:36,570 --> 02:31:39,480
He had to good to all the like
Cincinnati area places too.

3640
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:40,620
You know what he does,
man?

3641
02:31:40,650 --> 02:31:44,250
He'll just fly into a city with no plan.
Yeah.

3642
02:31:44,550 --> 02:31:47,280
Like in like when I was in Denver,
I go,

3643
02:31:47,281 --> 02:31:48,450
why are you here man?
He goes,

3644
02:31:48,451 --> 02:31:50,280
I just decided to fly in.
He's like,

3645
02:31:50,281 --> 02:31:51,600
they were going to,
uh,

3646
02:31:51,630 --> 02:31:54,840
the Canelo Alvarez fight.
Who's Canelo?

3647
02:31:54,841 --> 02:31:58,020
Alvarez fighting was the light skinned?
What?

3648
02:31:58,140 --> 02:31:59,640
Mexican dude?
Who Do you fight recently?

3649
02:32:01,980 --> 02:32:04,110
It's out of the fight was,
it was some fight in Vegas.

3650
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:08,350
Hey Dave,
I'll be at the Wilbur Theater January

3651
02:32:08,350 --> 02:32:11,580
21st,
2010 I'll fucking party with you and I'd

3652
02:32:11,660 --> 02:32:14,880
love to party with Chappelle.
My point was he just showed up out of

3653
02:32:14,881 --> 02:32:16,050
nowhere.
He just flew into Denver.

3654
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:19,590
I saw that picture that got like fucking
something like 249,000 likes.

3655
02:32:19,770 --> 02:32:21,300
What was the,
uh,

3656
02:32:21,301 --> 02:32:23,900
the video was hilarious.
What's right?

3657
02:32:24,710 --> 02:32:26,390
What's that?
Can Emir Khan fight?

3658
02:32:26,420 --> 02:32:28,430
Is that what it is?
Oh hmm.

3659
02:32:29,360 --> 02:32:30,720
Could be.
Okay.

3660
02:32:30,721 --> 02:32:33,710
So does he roll solo?
Liam Smith?

3661
02:32:34,070 --> 02:32:36,080
Who the fuck knows what fight it was
then?

3662
02:32:36,081 --> 02:32:37,310
Maybe I'm,
maybe I'm wrong.

3663
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:39,610
Maybe it's the manny Pacquiao fight
pack.

3664
02:32:39,880 --> 02:32:41,350
Y'All fight recently.
Yeah,

3665
02:32:41,720 --> 02:32:42,553
he did.
Right?

3666
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:45,560
He's gone to see him fight a few times.
What fight was,

3667
02:32:45,561 --> 02:32:46,670
it was,
it wasn't that long ago.

3668
02:32:46,671 --> 02:32:49,220
It was when I was in Denver.
When he goes to watch fights,

3669
02:32:49,730 --> 02:32:51,890
just flies in watching some boxing
matches.

3670
02:32:52,520 --> 02:32:55,280
He loves boxing.
Dave Chappelle loves boxing.

3671
02:32:56,180 --> 02:32:57,500
Really?
I got a buddy of his,

3672
02:32:57,501 --> 02:33:01,490
it's like a a boxer and does like boxing
training and shit.

3673
02:33:01,950 --> 02:33:03,450
Yeah,
Jesse Vargas.

3674
02:33:03,451 --> 02:33:05,210
Then November 5th weekend.
I think that was it.

3675
02:33:05,300 --> 02:33:06,140
Oh,
maybe that was it.

3676
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:07,993
Yeah,
it was probably yet.

3677
02:33:09,020 --> 02:33:10,040
But uh,
he just,

3678
02:33:10,100 --> 02:33:12,320
again,
he's like a version of Ra does whatever

3679
02:33:12,321 --> 02:33:14,510
the fuck he wants.
Definitely flies into places.

3680
02:33:14,570 --> 02:33:15,800
Yeah.
Comes and hangs out.

3681
02:33:16,730 --> 02:33:17,940
That's Rad.
I know he's done the,

3682
02:33:18,230 --> 02:33:23,230
that club that's like his favorite place
and that Denver and they said that,

3683
02:33:23,841 --> 02:33:26,300
um,
he's just been like land had been like,

3684
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:27,620
hey,
is anyone booked tonight?

3685
02:33:27,800 --> 02:33:32,800
I do the show and then we'll just add
nights if he feels like saying that's so

3686
02:33:33,981 --> 02:33:37,010
crazy.
It's so awesome though.

3687
02:33:37,100 --> 02:33:38,520
Yeah.
What's the most important,

3688
02:33:38,521 --> 02:33:40,260
I'll say it from the other side of you
too.

3689
02:33:40,330 --> 02:33:43,290
Chapelle is that,
I can't imagine what it's like for him

3690
02:33:43,291 --> 02:33:46,530
to go there,
like in and be like,

3691
02:33:46,550 --> 02:33:47,880
how are ticket sales?

3692
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:49,021
Like,
you know what I mean?

3693
02:33:49,021 --> 02:33:50,670
Like there's no such thing.
Yeah,

3694
02:33:50,870 --> 02:33:52,920
that's what I'm saying.
That at a club,

3695
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:54,660
what do you think he says that?
No,

3696
02:33:54,860 --> 02:33:55,890
not really.
I'll never,

3697
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:59,310
never really,
I mean not in 10 plus years for sure.

3698
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:00,860
Have you,
when was the last time you were like how

3699
02:34:00,861 --> 02:34:03,480
are ticket sales for like a club for
anything?

3700
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:08,250
I know I have counts sent to me when
things are sold out or not sold out,

3701
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:12,750
so I can decide whether or not I should
tweet it again or put it up on instagram

3702
02:34:12,751 --> 02:34:14,430
or something.
Yeah.

3703
02:34:14,460 --> 02:34:16,890
I just look at like,
I wonder what it's like to be Chappelle

3704
02:34:16,891 --> 02:34:17,980
and go,
I'll

3705
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:20,260
do this.
And then four minutes,

3706
02:34:20,890 --> 02:34:22,570
everyone that city would want to come
and see me.

3707
02:34:22,600 --> 02:34:27,600
Daniel tosh put up a tweet and in a
tweet he sold out like a whole tour in

3708
02:34:28,391 --> 02:34:29,081
the date.
Yeah.

3709
02:34:29,081 --> 02:34:32,320
Within like less than an hour.
The whole tour was sold out.

3710
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:34,233
Unreal,
man.

3711
02:34:34,540 --> 02:34:35,890
You did a show with them,
right?

3712
02:34:35,970 --> 02:34:37,240
Yeah.
It was so fun.

3713
02:34:37,310 --> 02:34:38,170
I've,
I've worked with them.

3714
02:34:38,171 --> 02:34:41,050
It's a fucking best.
He's a dude stole water in it.

3715
02:34:41,350 --> 02:34:43,150
Yeah.
He's crushing and it doesn't give a

3716
02:34:43,151 --> 02:34:44,470
fuck.
It doesn't another guy.

3717
02:34:45,570 --> 02:34:47,300
That's exactly why I'm doing interviews.
Yeah.

3718
02:34:47,380 --> 02:34:48,580
Doesn't want to do anything stupid.
He's like,

3719
02:34:48,610 --> 02:34:51,250
I don't care.
Tell one from the guy who gives a fuck a

3720
02:34:51,251 --> 02:34:52,340
hundred percent I'm like,
Oh,

3721
02:34:52,341 --> 02:34:54,190
do everything you need to do out with
them.

3722
02:34:54,191 --> 02:34:56,530
Soak it in.
He dangled Taj is a smart dude.

3723
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:57,190
Yeah.
But he's,

3724
02:34:57,190 --> 02:35:01,080
he's untethered to also like how,
so he's,

3725
02:35:01,450 --> 02:35:03,010
I mean,
it's very easy to go.

3726
02:35:03,010 --> 02:35:05,080
I'm not doing any press.
When you have the number one show on

3727
02:35:05,081 --> 02:35:07,390
comedy central for what,
10 years to,

3728
02:35:07,440 --> 02:35:11,580
he's saying it's very easily tethered,
meaning not controlled that you,

3729
02:35:11,620 --> 02:35:15,490
if it was like whatever,
top three or something,

3730
02:35:15,990 --> 02:35:18,160
you know,
like not the leading thing,

3731
02:35:18,190 --> 02:35:20,800
you'd still see him being very much
cause he,

3732
02:35:20,810 --> 02:35:21,400
oh,
he's still,

3733
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:22,233
yeah.
I,

3734
02:35:22,540 --> 02:35:25,390
I remember we did a show together in
Miami and there's a heckler in the front

3735
02:35:25,391 --> 02:35:27,610
row and like,
I was featuring form and I came off,

3736
02:35:27,640 --> 02:35:29,770
this is the two weeks after Georgia was
born,

3737
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:32,800
almost 1213 years ago.
And I said,

3738
02:35:32,801 --> 02:35:34,030
uh,
and he goes,

3739
02:35:34,031 --> 02:35:35,680
that's one way to do it.
He's like,

3740
02:35:35,830 --> 02:35:36,690
oh,
go,

3741
02:35:36,750 --> 02:35:37,870
what would you have done?
And he goes,

3742
02:35:37,871 --> 02:35:39,310
I would have kicked him out.
You'll see.

3743
02:35:39,400 --> 02:35:40,420
He goes,
go watch.

3744
02:35:40,570 --> 02:35:42,460
And I ran around to the back of the club
in Miami,

3745
02:35:42,461 --> 02:35:43,570
the old Miami Improv.

3746
02:35:44,140 --> 02:35:47,580
And Daniel Tosh literally folded his
fucking arms.

3747
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:49,600
He goes,
I will not start the show until he's La.

3748
02:35:49,630 --> 02:35:51,520
He's kicked out.
He didn't know,

3749
02:35:51,530 --> 02:35:54,120
knew him.
No one knew any of his jokes folded.

3750
02:35:54,121 --> 02:35:56,230
His arms goes,
I will not start the show until he gets

3751
02:35:56,231 --> 02:35:58,000
kicked out.
And I was like,

3752
02:35:58,240 --> 02:35:59,073
in my head,
I was like,

3753
02:35:59,140 --> 02:36:00,960
I was like,
can't you can't believe you're going to

3754
02:36:00,970 --> 02:36:03,400
fucking throw this show for one dude in
my head.

3755
02:36:03,730 --> 02:36:04,720
And by the way,
you know,

3756
02:36:04,721 --> 02:36:05,780
you knew me at the time.
Yeah.

3757
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:08,560
And everyone starts booing and he's
like,

3758
02:36:08,561 --> 02:36:09,550
no.
He goes,

3759
02:36:09,551 --> 02:36:10,420
no,
kick them out.

3760
02:36:10,450 --> 02:36:12,160
Kick them out right now.
Arms folded.

3761
02:36:12,190 --> 02:36:15,340
Kick 'em out right now.
What does the people booing at Daniel

3762
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:17,730
Tosh at the whole idea,
because I'd worked through it like I

3763
02:36:17,740 --> 02:36:20,520
had,
I'd worked through it and that's why was

3764
02:36:20,590 --> 02:36:22,380
the original heckle?
Like what happened?

3765
02:36:22,420 --> 02:36:24,910
It was a dick.
He was a redneck with a mullet branding

3766
02:36:24,911 --> 02:36:29,320
with a mullet.
You want to say it was Patrick swayze in

3767
02:36:29,321 --> 02:36:30,850
my head,
the guy was shirtless.

3768
02:36:30,851 --> 02:36:33,980
I'm sure it wasn't,
but I remember him being short story

3769
02:36:36,430 --> 02:36:40,270
every show you like,
this piece of shit was shirtless.

3770
02:36:41,970 --> 02:36:44,170
And he was like,
he literally,

3771
02:36:44,171 --> 02:36:45,340
the guy was like,
okay,

3772
02:36:45,341 --> 02:36:47,360
here's how it goes.
No.

3773
02:36:47,450 --> 02:36:48,160
So,
uh,

3774
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:52,990
so I'm in the back and I'm watching this
and then toss gets into it with the guy

3775
02:36:53,020 --> 02:36:54,490
and the guy starts calling fuck you and
talk.

3776
02:36:54,500 --> 02:36:54,851
She goes,
no,

3777
02:36:54,851 --> 02:36:56,170
fuck you.
You're not over.

3778
02:36:56,260 --> 02:36:57,130
Goodnight.
Have a good night.

3779
02:36:57,160 --> 02:36:58,960
You know,
in a very touch way I'm not doing it

3780
02:36:58,961 --> 02:36:59,920
right,
but I have a good night,

3781
02:37:00,010 --> 02:37:02,290
have a good night.
And then the guy goes,

3782
02:37:02,620 --> 02:37:05,680
I hope you die.
And then Tosh as the guys getting walked

3783
02:37:05,681 --> 02:37:06,401
out the door,
it goes,

3784
02:37:06,401 --> 02:37:07,660
I hope you get aids.

3785
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:12,840
This is 1990 90 2004 and everyone groans
and then toss it,

3786
02:37:13,831 --> 02:37:16,990
looks at the audience in a moment goes
the good kind of aids,

3787
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,220
like Magic Johnson a.
It's where he started opening movie

3788
02:37:19,221 --> 02:37:21,080
theaters.
The place goes fucking nuts.

3789
02:37:21,081 --> 02:37:24,180
And his first joke,
and this is old joke for toss,

3790
02:37:24,230 --> 02:37:27,950
so I'll say it,
his first joke is now it's by Vr or very

3791
02:37:27,951 --> 02:37:29,360
urban club.
He goes,

3792
02:37:30,020 --> 02:37:32,090
Koby Bryant,
so good at basketball.

3793
02:37:32,091 --> 02:37:35,060
He should be allowed to rape women.
And the place goes fucking.

3794
02:37:35,061 --> 02:37:37,730
But he goes,
if I was his,

3795
02:37:37,731 --> 02:37:40,820
this is his attorney,
I would simply put in a highlight reel

3796
02:37:40,821 --> 02:37:41,660
and go,
ladies and gentlemen,

3797
02:37:41,661 --> 02:37:43,610
the jury,
it's one white check a year.

3798
02:37:44,460 --> 02:37:47,720
And,
and I fucking sat in the back of the

3799
02:37:47,721 --> 02:37:48,260
room.
I was like,

3800
02:37:48,260 --> 02:37:51,200
this is my new favorite comic.
I walked into the agreement and waited

3801
02:37:51,201 --> 02:37:52,790
for him to come out and I was like,
dude,

3802
02:37:52,791 --> 02:37:53,750
you're fucking amazing.

3803
02:37:53,890 --> 02:37:54,860
It's a funny dude,
man.

3804
02:37:54,890 --> 02:37:57,230
He's a good guy too.
And he's a very good guy.

3805
02:37:57,260 --> 02:37:58,880
Like he talked to him,
he's right there.

3806
02:37:59,480 --> 02:38:02,390
He really is.
There's no weird fake shit going on

3807
02:38:04,510 --> 02:38:06,660
weeks ago and melrose.
And he said,

3808
02:38:07,130 --> 02:38:09,650
how's the weight thing going?
Should I go tweet,

3809
02:38:09,740 --> 02:38:11,050
tweet parties,
fat please people?

3810
02:38:11,060 --> 02:38:13,790
And he goes,
he goes and just walk.

3811
02:38:13,930 --> 02:38:14,751
Yeah,
yeah,

3812
02:38:14,751 --> 02:38:15,890
for sure.
Absolutely.

3813
02:38:16,340 --> 02:38:19,850
I saw him in Hollywood and he arrived at
the store.

3814
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:23,090
Him and Judd apatow bumped me and he,
and I was like,

3815
02:38:23,091 --> 02:38:24,290
it was,
my father didn't bug first side of the

3816
02:38:24,291 --> 02:38:29,291
store ever as a paid regular and I was
44 44 years old and I'm in touch.

3817
02:38:30,540 --> 02:38:31,050
She's like,
hi,

3818
02:38:31,050 --> 02:38:32,270
I'm sorry about this.
And you know,

3819
02:38:32,300 --> 02:38:34,450
very cool.
And then I say,

3820
02:38:34,670 --> 02:38:35,630
how's everything you use?
Good.

3821
02:38:35,870 --> 02:38:36,681
How's everything with you?
I said,

3822
02:38:36,681 --> 02:38:37,350
good.
And he goes,

3823
02:38:37,350 --> 02:38:38,071
I go,
how's Malibu?

3824
02:38:38,071 --> 02:38:38,930
He goes,
perfect.

3825
02:38:39,470 --> 02:38:40,940
Yoga,
meditation,

3826
02:38:41,060 --> 02:38:42,530
paddleboarding.
How the kids.

3827
02:38:43,560 --> 02:38:44,393
Okay.

3828
02:38:48,410 --> 02:38:50,320
Vacation.
Fucking love that guy.

3829
02:38:50,350 --> 02:38:51,550
Yeah,
it's good dude.

3830
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:54,700
Yeah.
To get it Puerto Rican beard.

3831
02:38:55,090 --> 02:38:56,770
Yeah.
I mean we can do a five hour podcasts

3832
02:38:56,771 --> 02:38:58,060
and just keep drinking.
I'm don't mind.

3833
02:38:58,570 --> 02:39:00,580
It's up to you dude.
But what's about,

3834
02:39:00,581 --> 02:39:02,350
uh,
two 15.

3835
02:39:02,500 --> 02:39:04,420
What time did we start this pitch?
1130.

3836
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:05,830
Yeah.
We get a dirty,

3837
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:09,160
you really bring a barber's minutes.
I got a little tweezer thing or a little

3838
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:13,000
over right there.
You ready to do this shit,

3839
02:39:13,001 --> 02:39:14,320
Tommy?
Hold on Tommy.

3840
02:39:14,500 --> 02:39:17,440
Tommy's just decided this is happening
and the whole show are you going to go

3841
02:39:17,441 --> 02:39:19,930
with,
is a bunch of attachments to that jammy

3842
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:25,080
depending on how close and if you want a
sculptor or contour or anything along

3843
02:39:25,421 --> 02:39:27,280
those lines,
but are you going to try to do the

3844
02:39:27,281 --> 02:39:29,140
prints?
You think Tommy?

3845
02:39:29,590 --> 02:39:31,180
Um,
here's what I want to do.

3846
02:39:31,210 --> 02:39:33,710
I want to,
I want to bring all this out.

3847
02:39:34,770 --> 02:39:36,310
Bring that bottom out.
Okay.

3848
02:39:36,311 --> 02:39:36,851
Right,
right.

3849
02:39:36,851 --> 02:39:39,380
I'm putting a nice line.
Okay.

3850
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,600
You're going to sculpt it?
Yeah.

3851
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:42,250
Yeah.
This is going to be a pro job.

3852
02:39:42,400 --> 02:39:43,270
Okay.
Um,

3853
02:39:43,660 --> 02:39:45,910
what about the stash?
That's what I was saying.

3854
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:46,900
I want to bring,

3855
02:39:54,090 --> 02:39:55,660
oh my God.
I might have to be this,

3856
02:39:56,260 --> 02:39:58,240
but if you do that,
he's just going to shave that off.

3857
02:40:06,220 --> 02:40:09,760
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

3858
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,260
Fucking pictures.
Pictures,

3859
02:40:15,030 --> 02:40:16,410
pictures.
A dude's beards.

3860
02:40:16,411 --> 02:40:18,960
It's so ridiculous.
It's a better,

3861
02:40:20,040 --> 02:40:22,240
there's nothing better than the Jaguar
guy though.

3862
02:40:22,241 --> 02:40:26,420
Or the Leopard guy was unbelievable.
Pretty guys off the charts.

3863
02:40:26,640 --> 02:40:29,870
I gotta put this on my phone too,
because I don't want to show my daughter

3864
02:40:29,871 --> 02:40:30,704
and hold it.
Hold on.

3865
02:40:30,900 --> 02:40:31,261
No,
no,

3866
02:40:31,261 --> 02:40:31,561
no,
no,

3867
02:40:31,561 --> 02:40:32,071
no.
Hold on.

3868
02:40:32,071 --> 02:40:32,904
I'll jamie

3869
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:35,460
wide angle so I can move over there.
Oh yeah,

3870
02:40:35,730 --> 02:40:36,660
yeah.
Okay.

3871
02:40:38,250 --> 02:40:42,510
I'm gonna move over here.
You guys with a beard?

3872
02:40:42,790 --> 02:40:46,640
Is My on it?
Total gut health and uh,

3873
02:40:47,900 --> 02:40:48,870
uh,
Shit.

3874
02:40:49,900 --> 02:40:51,330
You're ready?
Oh,

3875
02:40:51,331 --> 02:40:52,050
really?
Can I put it?

3876
02:40:52,050 --> 02:40:53,590
I should put it in like a,
a ramp.

3877
02:40:53,610 --> 02:40:55,200
Want me to hold it?
No,

3878
02:40:55,201 --> 02:40:58,270
I'll give it laugh.
Uh,

3879
02:40:58,740 --> 02:40:59,880
yeah,
but I want you to be a part of it.

3880
02:40:59,881 --> 02:41:01,440
I don't want you to know I'm right here
though.

3881
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:03,120
I know,
but I don't want you to have to focus on

3882
02:41:03,121 --> 02:41:05,190
me on you're holding it and give me that
fucking thing.

3883
02:41:05,191 --> 02:41:07,770
Shut up.
I'm right here.

3884
02:41:08,070 --> 02:41:10,140
I'm just going to rest it right here.
Drive.

3885
02:41:10,230 --> 02:41:11,970
Am I getting heroin on me right now?
Tom,

3886
02:41:12,570 --> 02:41:13,800
you're going to get a little bit of hair
on you.

3887
02:41:13,870 --> 02:41:14,521
Hold on.
Let's,

3888
02:41:14,521 --> 02:41:15,810
let's tighten this up.
Oh,

3889
02:41:15,811 --> 02:41:17,970
you got your passwords hun?
Oh,

3890
02:41:19,510 --> 02:41:23,640
it's a four four eight seven 77 right.
Good luck finding my phone.

3891
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:27,630
Wow.
How long it became a challenge.

3892
02:41:27,990 --> 02:41:29,670
Just like the weight loss challenge,

3893
02:41:30,080 --> 02:41:32,820
so fine.
And shows the Internet.

3894
02:41:32,850 --> 02:41:34,600
I bunch of sizzle is Dex.
Okay.

3895
02:41:34,740 --> 02:41:35,790
Hold on,
hold on to every one.

3896
02:41:35,791 --> 02:41:38,400
Okay.
Don't fuck with my hair.

3897
02:41:38,430 --> 02:41:40,110
Like my actually hair.
Hold on.

3898
02:41:40,300 --> 02:41:41,510
Hold on.
No,

3899
02:41:41,540 --> 02:41:41,820
no,
no.

3900
02:41:41,820 --> 02:41:46,130
Give me more true to a landscape in
which the landscape landscape.

3901
02:41:46,150 --> 02:41:49,140
Put it this way and now I'm going to
have to do the fucking anything on this.

3902
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:50,570
Okay.
Hit Stop Record.

3903
02:41:51,440 --> 02:41:52,760
I hit record.
Okay,

3904
02:41:52,761 --> 02:41:53,930
we're recording right now.
Okay.

3905
02:41:53,931 --> 02:41:55,190
Hold on.
I'm putting this here.

3906
02:41:55,191 --> 02:41:56,440
I'm going to take a,
uh,

3907
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:59,630
Bert Kreischer please explain to the
people it's about to happen and why

3908
02:42:03,140 --> 02:42:05,690
my beard is getting shaved because I
challenged Tommy bonds on a beer

3909
02:42:05,691 --> 02:42:10,430
challenge on who lost the most weight
and he lost a collective like six pounds

3910
02:42:10,431 --> 02:42:12,890
more than me.
I failed.

3911
02:42:13,640 --> 02:42:16,490
Go ahead.
But you did succeed in losing a ton of

3912
02:42:16,491 --> 02:42:17,151
weight.
I lost.

3913
02:42:17,151 --> 02:42:19,580
I lost 35 pounds.
I think so I,

3914
02:42:19,730 --> 02:42:22,010
I,
I'm happy that at least I'm not as fat

3915
02:42:22,011 --> 02:42:22,910
as I am.
Just start.

3916
02:42:23,240 --> 02:42:25,340
What if you look better before we do
this?

3917
02:42:25,610 --> 02:42:28,310
I will not want to feel better.
What if you decide like,

3918
02:42:28,311 --> 02:42:30,770
I liked the new birth?
Maybe the new Bert,

3919
02:42:31,310 --> 02:42:35,300
I a new bird doesn't,
doesn't sabotage.

3920
02:42:35,390 --> 02:42:37,810
Thanks.
Maybe they knew Berk with this new film,

3921
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:39,770
Rdo uncomfortable with this.
Can we go?

3922
02:42:43,610 --> 02:42:48,610
So Tommy buns insisted in shaving a
beautiful pattern of worked so hard in

3923
02:42:49,931 --> 02:42:51,620
that area.
You worked on.

3924
02:42:51,650 --> 02:42:54,710
What did you do?
I just grew it out and I sculpted it.

3925
02:42:57,140 --> 02:43:00,730
All sculpted area vulnerability.
How's it scope?

3926
02:43:01,360 --> 02:43:03,620
What I do is I,
I went to a black barbershop and I told

3927
02:43:03,621 --> 02:43:06,380
them that the people might cut my beard.
He taught them.

3928
02:43:06,470 --> 02:43:07,350
I ask them,
ask them,

3929
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:20,000
what do you love?
Where's the microphone on these things?

3930
02:43:20,710 --> 02:43:23,130
I might've had my fucking finger over
the microphone.

3931
02:43:23,131 --> 02:43:25,220
And your cell phone is okay.
I hope.

3932
02:43:25,221 --> 02:43:26,210
I don't know.
I don't,

3933
02:43:26,270 --> 02:43:29,540
I don't,
I feel from the podcast and it seems

3934
02:43:29,541 --> 02:43:30,960
like going really hard.
No,

3935
02:43:30,980 --> 02:43:31,813
no,
look good.

3936
02:43:32,330 --> 02:43:34,850
So you're sculpting.
You're not entirely shaving it off.

3937
02:43:34,851 --> 02:43:37,930
Tommy,
talking to the microphone please.

3938
02:43:37,960 --> 02:43:42,570
I mean so far Tommy,
why we decided to go high?

3939
02:43:42,650 --> 02:43:45,490
That's one of the art as I am a jawline.
Tommy,

3940
02:43:45,491 --> 02:43:48,370
why did you decide to sculpt it and not
completely shaved it off?

3941
02:43:48,730 --> 02:43:53,730
This is a guy where like I see so much
potential and I just want it.

3942
02:43:55,210 --> 02:43:57,380
I want it to maximize like,
oh,

3943
02:43:57,381 --> 02:44:02,120
where are you going to work?
Your phone is exploding with text

3944
02:44:02,121 --> 02:44:04,100
messages.
While I'm holding this up,

3945
02:44:04,430 --> 02:44:07,680
I could barely look at it because the
screen keeps filled it up with maslow.

3946
02:44:09,870 --> 02:44:14,870
He's giving you a Hitler Son.
Oh my God,

3947
02:44:16,831 --> 02:44:20,010
this is so stupid.
What's wrong with us?

3948
02:44:21,210 --> 02:44:22,350
We're all adults.

3949
02:44:24,690 --> 02:44:29,690
What the fuck is wrong with us?
Oh my God.

3950
02:44:34,980 --> 02:44:36,490
Very.
Can I please see it?

3951
02:44:39,550 --> 02:44:41,740
Oh my God.
So you're doing the prince.

3952
02:44:47,690 --> 02:44:49,370
Oh my God,
I can't breathe.

3953
02:44:51,280 --> 02:44:53,870
Oh.
Oh,

3954
02:44:57,380 --> 02:44:58,213
Ooh.

3955
02:45:14,990 --> 02:45:16,820
Is this the first time you saved another
man?

3956
02:45:16,910 --> 02:45:18,750
Oh yeah.
Oh,

3957
02:45:19,100 --> 02:45:24,100
but I've thought about it a lot.
I still feel the same right now.

3958
02:45:39,440 --> 02:45:42,230
I'm going home on home.
What are you doing?

3959
02:45:42,590 --> 02:45:44,570
Someone's hair.
My mom gave me.

3960
02:45:44,571 --> 02:45:47,080
What about,
what are we doing when we do it?

3961
02:45:47,180 --> 02:45:48,620
You can't drink right down,
son.

3962
02:45:48,750 --> 02:45:50,780
You're in labor.
Oh,

3963
02:45:51,010 --> 02:45:53,560
you've given birth to the new bird.
Oh.

3964
02:45:55,440 --> 02:45:56,720
Oh,
I'm a rash.

3965
02:45:56,840 --> 02:45:58,310
Oh,
this is hilarious.

3966
02:45:58,710 --> 02:46:00,890
Hm.
Tommy,

3967
02:46:01,400 --> 02:46:02,640
you an artist,
uh,

3968
02:46:03,010 --> 02:46:04,130
you know,
used to do Tommy.

3969
02:46:04,710 --> 02:46:09,710
He shouldn't once a year.
[inaudible] sculpt a fan's beard.

3970
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:13,430
You're a god damn artists,
dude.

3971
02:46:13,750 --> 02:46:15,740
Good job.
It looks amazing.

3972
02:46:15,820 --> 02:46:17,780
Really.
He shouldn't be the new thing that

3973
02:46:17,781 --> 02:46:21,260
people do.
Go back to like sculpting beards.

3974
02:46:22,970 --> 02:46:27,970
That could be a show.
That could be a show.

3975
02:46:30,380 --> 02:46:33,620
That's all the fluid I have on my body.
This can be a show you do on the travel

3976
02:46:33,621 --> 02:46:38,621
channel where a y'all get fucked up and
get someone and you shave their beard.

3977
02:46:41,090 --> 02:46:43,460
He's going to be very right there.
Oh Shit.

3978
02:46:45,260 --> 02:46:50,260
Don't go too hard on high
vulnerability.

3979
02:46:54,140 --> 02:46:56,220
Oh,
you look really good at.

3980
02:46:56,221 --> 02:46:57,310
They're really,
yeah.

3981
02:46:57,970 --> 02:46:59,310
Yeah.
You're gonna like this.

3982
02:47:03,430 --> 02:47:05,980
This might be the greatest,
greatest.

3983
02:47:06,020 --> 02:47:06,853
Tom,

3984
02:47:06,970 --> 02:47:08,820
are we good?
We're pretty quick.

3985
02:47:08,890 --> 02:47:09,581
Yeah.
All right.

3986
02:47:09,581 --> 02:47:13,660
So for people just listening,
what Tom has done is sculpt birds,

3987
02:47:13,661 --> 02:47:17,570
beard,
and what could best be described as a

3988
02:47:17,580 --> 02:47:22,470
fencer from the 16 hundreds in France.
A fence her.

3989
02:47:22,890 --> 02:47:26,360
Yeah.
You look like either that or uh,

3990
02:47:28,130 --> 02:47:30,650
or someone who would lie about being
Puerto Rican.

3991
02:47:31,910 --> 02:47:36,750
Cause they're really from like
somewhere that no one's ever heard of.

3992
02:47:36,780 --> 02:47:39,720
And they're tired of people saying,
where the fuck is that?

3993
02:47:39,721 --> 02:47:40,554
And they go,
it's,

3994
02:47:40,830 --> 02:47:41,880
yeah,
I'm just Puerto Rican.

3995
02:47:43,510 --> 02:47:47,520
He looks very Spanish Mike.
But New York City fly,

3996
02:47:47,850 --> 02:47:50,010
you might stick with it yet.
You might.

3997
02:47:50,220 --> 02:47:51,053
Oh,
Brill.

3998
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:55,240
He's a Goddamn Maurice.
Imagine if it turns out the Tommy Buns

3999
02:47:55,241 --> 02:47:58,150
is the premiere beard artists in North
America.

4000
02:47:59,870 --> 02:48:02,960
I mean,
we're watching this then.

4001
02:48:02,961 --> 02:48:06,640
What's the way and really how many
people are watching this or thousands.

4002
02:48:07,220 --> 02:48:11,840
That's so ridiculous.
I feel like you might really be happy

4003
02:48:11,841 --> 02:48:13,010
with it.
You didn't really go from there.

4004
02:48:13,710 --> 02:48:14,543
Okay.

4005
02:48:16,040 --> 02:48:18,290
Are you going to keep this or are you
going to turn?

4006
02:48:18,291 --> 02:48:19,420
Turn me please.
Huh?

4007
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,110
That's actually not bad and I'm not
bullshitting.

4008
02:48:22,670 --> 02:48:24,710
I'm not bullshitting at all.
I don't want to be surprised.

4009
02:48:24,711 --> 02:48:25,930
Let me see.
That's not bull.

4010
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:27,840
I'm not bullshitting.
You look good dude.

4011
02:48:29,210 --> 02:48:30,230
Here's the thing,
man.

4012
02:48:30,460 --> 02:48:31,293
Look at you.
Sorry.

4013
02:48:31,530 --> 02:48:34,120
Go on.
I look like I work at blue.

4014
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:36,460
The apes.
I look at it.

4015
02:48:36,490 --> 02:48:39,180
Fuck no,
no,

4016
02:48:39,530 --> 02:48:40,530
this is not.
Look,

4017
02:48:42,630 --> 02:48:45,800
he doesn't look good.
Look at all the hair on me.

4018
02:48:46,430 --> 02:48:49,240
You get an earring on each year.
A big hoop like a pirate,

4019
02:48:49,250 --> 02:48:51,580
but I look like,
I feel like you rent.

4020
02:48:52,060 --> 02:48:57,060
You Rent Jet Skis for sure.
Through like what are you good idea

4021
02:49:02,110 --> 02:49:05,330
to fucking Shane who hearings?
Barry.

4022
02:49:05,750 --> 02:49:08,190
Take your phone buddy.
Oh my God.

4023
02:49:08,320 --> 02:49:11,070
It looks pretty good.
Yeah.

4024
02:49:11,130 --> 02:49:12,480
Oh,
Holy Shit.

4025
02:49:13,080 --> 02:49:14,820
Can you see yourself performing like
that?

4026
02:49:15,690 --> 02:49:16,950
Fuck Ya.
Yeah,

4027
02:49:16,951 --> 02:49:18,990
of course you have to for a while,
right?

4028
02:49:20,250 --> 02:49:21,720
No dummy.
Shave it off tonight?

4029
02:49:21,750 --> 02:49:22,411
No,
no,

4030
02:49:22,411 --> 02:49:24,210
no.
You should definitely go on stage for

4031
02:49:24,211 --> 02:49:26,340
the audience.
The people that are going to appreciate,

4032
02:49:26,820 --> 02:49:29,520
they want to see you knowing exactly
what happened.

4033
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:32,600
He's going to fix it.
It's not done.

4034
02:49:32,800 --> 02:49:33,740
You know?
That's what weird.

4035
02:49:33,741 --> 02:49:37,880
We never really determined when he's
done so tom can like step back,

4036
02:49:38,180 --> 02:49:40,940
look at it and decide to do some
changes.

4037
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:44,390
Oh my God.
He found the rash.

4038
02:49:45,470 --> 02:49:46,303
Yeah,
man.

4039
02:49:46,400 --> 02:49:48,350
Sometimes we have rashes.
Ladies and gentlemen,

4040
02:49:48,830 --> 02:49:51,560
it's not your fault.
I know you feel like you did something

4041
02:49:51,561 --> 02:49:53,750
naughty that the Lord punished you with
a rash,

4042
02:49:54,050 --> 02:49:55,400
but that's just superstitious.

4043
02:49:56,050 --> 02:50:00,070
She was in fact a really bacterial
infections on the surface of your

4044
02:50:00,080 --> 02:50:02,000
scandals,
so we're definitely better now.

4045
02:50:02,630 --> 02:50:05,070
I recommend defense soap.
Let me see.

4046
02:50:06,380 --> 02:50:09,080
I said just a mustache.
Fuck all that squirrely little bottom

4047
02:50:09,081 --> 02:50:10,250
here.
If you want to make them keep it for

4048
02:50:10,260 --> 02:50:11,031
awhile.
Yeah,

4049
02:50:11,031 --> 02:50:12,260
we'll keep it for a while.
I'm a grown man.

4050
02:50:12,261 --> 02:50:13,010
I'll go.
Let me shave.

4051
02:50:13,010 --> 02:50:13,940
None of them.
Mustache.

4052
02:50:14,210 --> 02:50:16,580
How about this?
We get rid of all this crazy shit.

4053
02:50:16,640 --> 02:50:18,730
Now I know what it looks like.
Give you a goddamn police.

4054
02:50:18,731 --> 02:50:19,730
Things.
Mustache man,

4055
02:50:20,480 --> 02:50:22,160
you actually look like I looked like a
monkey for real.

4056
02:50:22,220 --> 02:50:25,520
Let me see you.
You looked like you look like a top

4057
02:50:25,521 --> 02:50:27,200
notch bowler from Wisconsin.

4058
02:50:29,460 --> 02:50:34,460
You're a dude is on like world series of
bowling and everybody fears you like the

4059
02:50:34,491 --> 02:50:36,770
Bill Murray character.
Can you imagine making out with me in

4060
02:50:36,771 --> 02:50:38,490
the dark and you're like,
what is that on the top?

4061
02:50:38,560 --> 02:50:39,920
Oh,
it would be covered in the beard.

4062
02:50:40,170 --> 02:50:44,900
What was that movie?
Fucking great kingpin was that movie

4063
02:50:44,901 --> 02:50:46,220
good?
Starts flirting with a girl and he goes,

4064
02:50:46,221 --> 02:50:48,880
not you.
Yeah.

4065
02:50:49,290 --> 02:50:51,020
Oh Man.
Remember when,

4066
02:50:51,021 --> 02:50:53,300
uh,
we had to have sex with his landlord and

4067
02:50:53,301 --> 02:50:57,050
order to pay for the rent.
Nothing like that to loosen up at shit,

4068
02:50:58,010 --> 02:50:58,970
throw it up.
Benches,

4069
02:50:58,990 --> 02:51:00,470
toilet.
You remember that?

4070
02:51:00,471 --> 02:51:01,304
He,
uh,

4071
02:51:01,490 --> 02:51:05,390
he has the planned like robbery with the
guy and then,

4072
02:51:05,510 --> 02:51:09,220
uh,
sorry in my face in it.

4073
02:51:11,930 --> 02:51:12,590
Then he,
uh,

4074
02:51:12,590 --> 02:51:17,210
he throws hot coffee in that guy's face
because he has to act like that.

4075
02:51:17,211 --> 02:51:18,450
It wasn't a scam,
you know,

4076
02:51:18,451 --> 02:51:19,850
like,
like the landlord comes and he's like,

4077
02:51:19,851 --> 02:51:20,960
what?
You're here.

4078
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:24,680
And he just takes the hot coffee and
splashed in the guy fucking screens for

4079
02:51:24,681 --> 02:51:27,650
his life to Jesus Christ.
This feels so weird.

4080
02:51:27,950 --> 02:51:29,390
This looks good.
I can only imagine.

4081
02:51:30,410 --> 02:51:33,320
It feels weird so I didn't know.
My face will be this close to my bones.

4082
02:51:34,280 --> 02:51:35,400
Well,
do do you guys view,

4083
02:51:35,450 --> 02:51:38,060
just don't do it like this,
like this craziness,

4084
02:51:38,360 --> 02:51:41,780
but just keep going healthy style.
You know what I mean?

4085
02:51:41,781 --> 02:51:44,750
We've got to figure out a way to get you
guys to not,

4086
02:51:46,220 --> 02:51:47,570
I mean,
let's be honest,

4087
02:51:48,350 --> 02:51:50,660
if you're not,
there's no way to do it.

4088
02:51:51,320 --> 02:51:52,071
If you,
if you,

4089
02:51:52,071 --> 02:51:54,680
if you,
if there is a target weight,

4090
02:51:54,710 --> 02:51:56,570
you're going to dehydrate yourself,
right?

4091
02:51:56,600 --> 02:51:57,433
Yeah,
of course.

4092
02:51:57,470 --> 02:51:59,750
You're going to,
you never know what very seldom does

4093
02:51:59,751 --> 02:52:01,460
someone go.
I'll get below that.

4094
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:05,270
You Post that picture of me to talk to
me right out.

4095
02:52:05,340 --> 02:52:08,380
We're going to get totally used to it,
but I do suggest you keep the mustache.

4096
02:52:08,860 --> 02:52:10,960
I think it's a wonderful [inaudible] to
your face.

4097
02:52:11,410 --> 02:52:15,790
It helps you party man image and again
you'll clear curling champion from

4098
02:52:15,791 --> 02:52:16,660
Saskatchewan.

4099
02:52:19,790 --> 02:52:24,340
You look like a duck hunting guide.
Ailes had told me that a person should

4100
02:52:24,341 --> 02:52:28,600
do head shots while
you lived at a guy who teaches people

4101
02:52:28,601 --> 02:52:33,601
how to fly fish
because it knows the difference between

4102
02:52:35,120 --> 02:52:37,000
a Mallard duck.
Exactly.

4103
02:52:37,001 --> 02:52:38,930
Less a diver duck.
Oh,

4104
02:52:38,940 --> 02:52:42,940
it was a totally different kind of meat.
You look like you definitely live in

4105
02:52:42,941 --> 02:52:47,941
your hometown
and you got to pennzoil tattoos,

4106
02:52:51,490 --> 02:52:53,620
bought a mustache.
How's it look good?

4107
02:52:53,650 --> 02:52:54,820
He looks really good.
Really?

4108
02:52:54,821 --> 02:52:56,260
Yeah.
You should see it closer.

4109
02:52:57,100 --> 02:53:00,010
Let me see your instagram.
I do think there's something to be said

4110
02:53:00,011 --> 02:53:03,610
for bringing back mustache.
There's a few people who do it and it's

4111
02:53:03,611 --> 02:53:05,320
a strong look.
No,

4112
02:53:05,321 --> 02:53:07,180
it looks good.
It looks like they look yourself up

4113
02:53:07,181 --> 02:53:08,014
there.
Oh,

4114
02:53:08,270 --> 02:53:09,280
oh,
oh.

4115
02:53:09,281 --> 02:53:11,740
I need to get my teeth cleaned.
Jesus.

4116
02:53:11,770 --> 02:53:14,450
This just looks sad.
Oh,

4117
02:53:14,860 --> 02:53:16,240
it looks like it.
Yes.

4118
02:53:16,900 --> 02:53:19,000
It looks like a guy who lost a fuck ton
of weight.

4119
02:53:20,160 --> 02:53:20,770
[inaudible]

4120
02:53:20,770 --> 02:53:22,820
to win a competition and I got a
mustache.

4121
02:53:22,840 --> 02:53:25,960
You rock this look and you go back up to
two 56,

4122
02:53:28,390 --> 02:53:30,330
that would be,
that would be an interesting,

4123
02:53:30,750 --> 02:53:33,850
so let me ask you guys this because
we're probably nearing the end of this

4124
02:53:33,851 --> 02:53:34,770
experience.
Yeah.

4125
02:53:34,970 --> 02:53:37,240
Um,
how are you guys going to go forth like

4126
02:53:37,270 --> 02:53:39,700
this?
Most of this was healthy for you,

4127
02:53:39,701 --> 02:53:42,190
Tom.
I think the majority of it was healthy

4128
02:53:42,191 --> 02:53:43,700
except for the last couple of days.
Yeah.

4129
02:53:44,230 --> 02:53:47,710
The actual trying to make the weight.
And Burt at the very least like you

4130
02:53:47,711 --> 02:53:49,680
curbed some of your insanity,
you know,

4131
02:53:49,840 --> 02:53:52,630
he curved it to the point where you lost
a tremendous amount of weight.

4132
02:53:52,790 --> 02:53:55,510
You know what I mean?
You got to feel lighter and better.

4133
02:53:55,660 --> 02:53:56,860
Right.
So how do you,

4134
02:53:57,220 --> 02:53:59,350
how do you move forward now?
Do you,

4135
02:53:59,351 --> 02:54:02,140
uh,
go back to life as usual or do you start

4136
02:54:02,141 --> 02:54:03,100
another contest?

4137
02:54:03,580 --> 02:54:05,740
Uh,
we can start another contest.

4138
02:54:05,741 --> 02:54:07,830
I'm totally comfortable with that.
It seems like burt wants to start none

4139
02:54:07,840 --> 02:54:09,340
of the content.
I want to start another contest.

4140
02:54:09,670 --> 02:54:11,890
I want already to be involved too.
Cause I like Orange Ball Chin,

4141
02:54:11,950 --> 02:54:12,401
Don,
Don,

4142
02:54:12,401 --> 02:54:13,234
Don,
Don.

4143
02:54:13,400 --> 02:54:17,470
So we got to get him in like ours.
We should do this online.

4144
02:54:18,950 --> 02:54:20,470
But the challenge doesn't have to be
weighed at the time.

4145
02:54:20,471 --> 02:54:21,304
It can be something.
No,

4146
02:54:21,470 --> 02:54:23,110
it be,
what could it be?

4147
02:54:23,300 --> 02:54:26,080
Um,
can be anything,

4148
02:54:26,081 --> 02:54:27,880
man.
That's the crazy thing about the

4149
02:54:27,881 --> 02:54:29,170
internet.
We can do whatever the fuck we want.

4150
02:54:29,620 --> 02:54:31,060
Whatever we come up with,
we could just do,

4151
02:54:31,330 --> 02:54:32,051
yeah,
no shit.

4152
02:54:32,051 --> 02:54:33,340
Right.
You guys can compete and stuff.

4153
02:54:33,341 --> 02:54:34,840
That doesn't even suck.
Right?

4154
02:54:34,870 --> 02:54:36,400
Like it doesn't have to be something
that sucks.

4155
02:54:36,401 --> 02:54:39,130
Like trying to drain your body and
personal go around the world the

4156
02:54:39,131 --> 02:54:42,010
fastest.
That sounds like a bird thing.

4157
02:54:42,010 --> 02:54:42,390
No,
no.

4158
02:54:42,390 --> 02:54:44,260
I'm just trying to think.
I'm just trying to ballpark your guns

4159
02:54:45,240 --> 02:54:49,120
but a bunch of data.
But the idea is like a competition show,

4160
02:54:49,150 --> 02:54:51,730
which mean to you guys would be amazing.
Yeah.

4161
02:54:52,120 --> 02:54:54,520
Cause it would be in the best spirits
too.

4162
02:54:54,790 --> 02:54:57,640
Like here's the thing about competition.
Like this right.

4163
02:54:58,240 --> 02:55:00,310
There was,
there was never any animosity.

4164
02:55:00,311 --> 02:55:02,140
So after it's over,
we're all laughing.

4165
02:55:02,170 --> 02:55:04,250
Yeah.
Whereas like if you have a fight for

4166
02:55:04,251 --> 02:55:05,890
instance,
and uh,

4167
02:55:05,960 --> 02:55:07,850
two people don't like each other in
particular.

4168
02:55:07,890 --> 02:55:10,370
Yeah.
There's always animosity before and

4169
02:55:10,371 --> 02:55:12,080
after.
People are pissed.

4170
02:55:12,770 --> 02:55:13,950
Oh,
it's always chaos.

4171
02:55:13,970 --> 02:55:16,150
She get our wives involved.
Dude,

4172
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:18,680
you're trying to,
you're trying to get this personal sun.

4173
02:55:18,770 --> 02:55:19,580
No,
our wives.

4174
02:55:19,580 --> 02:55:22,220
That's cause that's what the untapped,
we're both happy this is over.

4175
02:55:23,980 --> 02:55:25,610
No,
I think I I liked this.

4176
02:55:25,630 --> 02:55:28,280
I,
I'm telling you I'm not adverse to doing

4177
02:55:28,281 --> 02:55:31,370
another competition at all and I think
it should be something crazy.

4178
02:55:31,400 --> 02:55:32,840
Well here we are in January,
right?

4179
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:34,850
Okay.
This is the beginning first couple of

4180
02:55:34,851 --> 02:55:39,851
days of January,
2017 why don't we knock it around for a

4181
02:55:40,670 --> 02:55:45,670
few months and we'll figure out how to
finance some other competition.

4182
02:55:46,400 --> 02:55:48,260
This is like,
yeah,

4183
02:55:48,480 --> 02:55:51,590
so instead of a,
well let's just figure out like what

4184
02:55:51,591 --> 02:55:54,950
would be a fun thing to do and a
difficult thing to do.

4185
02:55:55,200 --> 02:55:57,080
Like write two things,
two parts.

4186
02:55:57,110 --> 02:55:58,330
A key fact.
Yeah.

4187
02:55:58,410 --> 02:56:02,150
Like will it be a fun thing to do but
also a difficult thing to do?

4188
02:56:02,360 --> 02:56:04,430
Will you guys could do it as a
competition.

4189
02:56:04,610 --> 02:56:07,490
It would be a big deal for you to the
point where winning it would be

4190
02:56:07,491 --> 02:56:09,890
valuable.
You'd want to like really work hard

4191
02:56:09,891 --> 02:56:11,600
towards it.
It'd be worth your dedication.

4192
02:56:11,890 --> 02:56:13,970
Did we can even bring like sponsors
involved?

4193
02:56:13,971 --> 02:56:17,720
I guarantee you it'd be like,
it takes like five minutes to figure out

4194
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:21,440
what sponsors would be interested in
whatever kind of competition we figured

4195
02:56:21,441 --> 02:56:24,620
out
we could do something really fun.

4196
02:56:24,740 --> 02:56:26,480
We could do something really fun.
Yeah.

4197
02:56:26,840 --> 02:56:30,200
Like what would you guys want to do?
Like what seems like a fun competition?

4198
02:56:30,201 --> 02:56:33,050
Like want to go to the adventure?
What do you want to do there?

4199
02:56:33,350 --> 02:56:34,340
I don't know.
I just want to go there.

4200
02:56:34,460 --> 02:56:35,293
Oh really?
Yeah,

4201
02:56:35,900 --> 02:56:40,900
I think Racing Raisa that's fun.
Let's see what the core first person to

4202
02:56:41,331 --> 02:56:43,100
get across the United States.
The first,

4203
02:56:44,270 --> 02:56:45,140
was that a sentence?

4204
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:50,930
Um,
yeah,

4205
02:56:50,931 --> 02:56:53,400
you could definitely do that.
Um,

4206
02:56:53,930 --> 02:56:55,880
what you do like a cannonball run type
thing.

4207
02:56:56,450 --> 02:56:59,990
I wouldn't say that one of you or you do
a lot of crossfit and you do a lot of

4208
02:56:59,991 --> 02:57:03,200
exercise one.
Neither one of you has like any immense

4209
02:57:03,201 --> 02:57:05,900
physical advantages.
Like if you started in a physical

4210
02:57:05,901 --> 02:57:07,820
competition right now,
right?

4211
02:57:08,060 --> 02:57:09,640
Like if you guys wanted to do some
great,

4212
02:57:09,641 --> 02:57:11,240
we don't,
you know those crazy marine things they

4213
02:57:11,241 --> 02:57:13,910
do with,
they climb over fucking poles who let's

4214
02:57:13,911 --> 02:57:16,340
go to seal training.
Listen to me,

4215
02:57:16,341 --> 02:57:18,470
don't do that.
Just listen to me.

4216
02:57:18,471 --> 02:57:19,350
That's worse than,
no,

4217
02:57:19,760 --> 02:57:23,750
I'm talking about some crazy like one of
those obstacle courses we have to like

4218
02:57:23,751 --> 02:57:27,590
swing from the monkey bars and climb on
the pole and all that jazz and climb up

4219
02:57:27,591 --> 02:57:32,330
the net though the rope net race each
other doing something like that and make

4220
02:57:32,331 --> 02:57:33,620
a big deal out of that.

4221
02:57:33,650 --> 02:57:35,760
That would be fun.
You guys didn't have to getting sick

4222
02:57:35,840 --> 02:57:39,930
shape.
Fireman Training Department Training

4223
02:57:39,930 --> 02:57:40,910
Ninja,
American Ninja.

4224
02:57:41,060 --> 02:57:44,210
Matt Iseman is on that,
but the problem is like,

4225
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:47,080
do you really think you could even
complete that?

4226
02:57:47,081 --> 02:57:49,820
I could get halfway through it,
man.

4227
02:57:49,821 --> 02:57:51,920
I'm telling you I'm not that cocky
mental gene.

4228
02:57:51,940 --> 02:57:54,080
It for sure.
I moved my body pretty good and I

4229
02:57:54,081 --> 02:57:56,540
watched that on TV and I go out.
I think I'd probably fall off one of

4230
02:57:56,541 --> 02:57:57,640
those things called Matt.
Matt Iseman.

4231
02:57:57,710 --> 02:58:02,070
Right now he can get us on the course
and you were telling me what they'll get

4232
02:58:02,071 --> 02:58:04,260
halfway through and fall down.
I can definitely,

4233
02:58:04,280 --> 02:58:06,780
that is alphabet starts.
I can definitely get halfway through.

4234
02:58:06,900 --> 02:58:08,640
Well,
what do you think you'd be able to do?

4235
02:58:08,840 --> 02:58:09,870
Well,
I've already done the training.

4236
02:58:09,930 --> 02:58:10,291
No,
no,

4237
02:58:10,291 --> 02:58:11,250
I'm saying him.
Sorry.

4238
02:58:11,580 --> 02:58:13,140
Oh,
definitely more than half,

4239
02:58:13,141 --> 02:58:16,620
but I think we could also find,
I can get past on lily pads.

4240
02:58:16,740 --> 02:58:20,220
I think the whole thing.
Why don't we find it a course that is

4241
02:58:20,370 --> 02:58:22,070
like what you're saying,
difficult wipe out,

4242
02:58:23,130 --> 02:58:24,210
wipe out.
They don't do anymore.

4243
02:58:24,270 --> 02:58:26,190
Unfortunately.
That would be an easy one to set up

4244
02:58:26,191 --> 02:58:28,170
because Mac units was one of the
executive.

4245
02:58:28,171 --> 02:58:29,590
Bruce is a fear factor.
Oh.

4246
02:58:29,710 --> 02:58:30,421
Oh really?
Yeah.

4247
02:58:30,421 --> 02:58:32,310
That was his show.
Yeah.

4248
02:58:32,311 --> 02:58:35,820
The people who created wipe out and made
wipe out in America.

4249
02:58:36,060 --> 02:58:37,800
They were,
most of them were friends of mine,

4250
02:58:38,310 --> 02:58:41,580
but I could like a triathlon mom,
like something triathlon would be a

4251
02:58:41,581 --> 02:58:42,420
motherfucker.
Dude,

4252
02:58:42,421 --> 02:58:44,060
if you really wanted to do that,
that's your man.

4253
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:46,040
Serious commitment,
man.

4254
02:58:46,190 --> 02:58:48,090
Man.
Might come in and sponsor us,

4255
02:58:48,330 --> 02:58:51,510
then we start to go to the death to the
next level.

4256
02:58:52,290 --> 02:58:54,300
Now that you have him over the ropes,
wants to go,

4257
02:58:55,350 --> 02:58:57,690
he wants to drown you in the ocean.
He wants,

4258
02:58:57,900 --> 02:59:00,540
he wants the possibility that he'll be
swimming away and he looks back and a

4259
02:59:00,541 --> 02:59:03,330
shark takes you could have the iron man.

4260
02:59:04,980 --> 02:59:05,551
Yeah.
What's the,

4261
02:59:05,551 --> 02:59:06,390
uh,
what is the,

4262
02:59:06,391 --> 02:59:09,480
it's like a short race.
It's a fucking marathon.

4263
02:59:09,481 --> 02:59:12,960
You've got to run a hundred miles a
marathon and you get to ride a hundred

4264
02:59:12,960 --> 02:59:15,000
miles on a bike and you get to swim a
couple miles.

4265
02:59:15,001 --> 02:59:17,820
Right.
I know the guy at Spartan race,

4266
02:59:17,980 --> 02:59:20,370
the guys,
what exactly are the parameters?

4267
02:59:20,371 --> 02:59:21,600
Like what clothes?
Anything.

4268
02:59:21,660 --> 02:59:23,850
What is this Jayman battle frog thing
they show on espn.

4269
02:59:23,851 --> 02:59:26,820
Sometimes it's like teams really racist,
but they could probably do it.

4270
02:59:27,030 --> 02:59:28,710
Oh,
we can do battle frog.

4271
02:59:29,220 --> 02:59:30,930
I'll look at this.
You'd have to run up this thing.

4272
02:59:32,350 --> 02:59:34,550
It's like a navy seal obstacle course.
Basically.

4273
02:59:34,570 --> 02:59:37,110
It's like saying what's really
fascinating about you guys is that you

4274
02:59:37,111 --> 02:59:42,111
both love each other and you're both
interesting combination of impulse and

4275
02:59:42,301 --> 02:59:45,780
discipline.
Re ridiculous,

4276
02:59:45,870 --> 02:59:50,580
fanatical,
like scramble sprint to catch up versus

4277
02:59:50,581 --> 02:59:55,230
slow steady marathon pace and it's
really funny man.

4278
02:59:55,590 --> 02:59:57,480
And laughing hard the whole way.

4279
02:59:57,810 --> 02:59:59,850
The tip of the spear.
Who made those graphics?

4280
02:59:59,851 --> 03:00:02,850
You don't make the tip of the spear and
make it a neon green.

4281
03:00:02,851 --> 03:00:04,410
You fuck.
That's not scary.

4282
03:00:04,980 --> 03:00:08,670
Tip of the spear out there.
Jabbing at the enemy with a cartoon

4283
03:00:08,671 --> 03:00:10,560
colors.
Is that going to be our thing?

4284
03:00:10,561 --> 03:00:12,090
Then we're going to find a course.
No.

4285
03:00:12,091 --> 03:00:15,780
What we should do is turn this TV show
into like ultimate fighter competition

4286
03:00:15,781 --> 03:00:19,280
thing where we beat both have teams of
losers like us.

4287
03:00:19,680 --> 03:00:20,520
Let's do that.
Yeah,

4288
03:00:20,521 --> 03:00:23,280
let's bounce around a bunch of ideas and
not commit to any of them.

4289
03:00:23,281 --> 03:00:26,820
Let's try to figure out like what would
be the best idea to have a fun

4290
03:00:26,821 --> 03:00:30,750
competition between you guys that would
benefit you because you guys both

4291
03:00:30,751 --> 03:00:34,200
benefited in a huge way harder.
You both look amazing.

4292
03:00:34,410 --> 03:00:37,020
Like dude,
I showed your video to my wife of you.

4293
03:00:37,021 --> 03:00:39,450
I'm joking around about the work was
already done,

4294
03:00:39,451 --> 03:00:41,130
that your work was already done and she
was like,

4295
03:00:41,131 --> 03:00:43,140
Holy Shit.
They just went,

4296
03:00:43,141 --> 03:00:44,540
Holy Shit.
Like they look you,

4297
03:00:44,541 --> 03:00:46,250
your skin looks healthy.
Yeah,

4298
03:00:46,400 --> 03:00:48,420
your face looks thinner.
I was like,

4299
03:00:48,450 --> 03:00:52,260
then you look vibrant.
You look like your body had more energy

4300
03:00:52,261 --> 03:00:53,520
to it.
Thanks man.

4301
03:00:53,580 --> 03:00:55,080
I definitely do.
I mean it's,

4302
03:00:55,081 --> 03:00:57,300
you know,
it's a lot of weight to he then you

4303
03:00:57,301 --> 03:00:58,111
always think about like,
man,

4304
03:00:58,111 --> 03:00:59,650
I was walking around with that every
day.

4305
03:00:59,790 --> 03:00:59,980
It's

4306
03:00:59,980 --> 03:01:02,800
too crazy and we talked about it
yesterday and sometimes people think

4307
03:01:02,801 --> 03:01:04,390
we're insensitive when we talk about
this,

4308
03:01:04,391 --> 03:01:07,090
like the subject of fat shaming,
whether or not fat shaming is a good

4309
03:01:07,091 --> 03:01:07,361
thing.
Look,

4310
03:01:07,361 --> 03:01:09,340
it's never a good thing to be mean to
people,

4311
03:01:09,460 --> 03:01:13,150
but it might not be the worst thing in
the world to feel uncomfortable about

4312
03:01:13,151 --> 03:01:17,020
the current state you're in.
If you know that states unhealthy and

4313
03:01:17,021 --> 03:01:19,300
attaching all these like magic words to
it,

4314
03:01:19,301 --> 03:01:21,820
like fat shaming,
you decide and it's certain actions can

4315
03:01:21,821 --> 03:01:25,360
never take place so you certain
acknowledgements of someone's issue with

4316
03:01:25,361 --> 03:01:27,940
their wade can never be discussed
because it hurts people's feelings.

4317
03:01:28,300 --> 03:01:30,940
It doesn't necessarily always do that
person a service.

4318
03:01:31,090 --> 03:01:33,280
Like we'd all be better off if we were
healthy.

4319
03:01:33,550 --> 03:01:35,980
It feels great to eat fucking Krispy
Kreme doughnuts,

4320
03:01:36,280 --> 03:01:37,240
but you know,
it feels better.

4321
03:01:37,910 --> 03:01:41,530
It's he krispy Kreme donuts after he
lost 40 pounds and you know that

4322
03:01:41,531 --> 03:01:43,720
tomorrow you're going to get back on the
fucking treadmill.

4323
03:01:43,750 --> 03:01:44,291
Yeah.
You know,

4324
03:01:44,291 --> 03:01:45,670
and you're going to start eating healthy
again.

4325
03:01:45,671 --> 03:01:48,760
Give yourself a reward days,
but don't let it control your goddamn

4326
03:01:48,880 --> 03:01:52,840
life and don't wrap it up and wrap that
criticism of protect yourself from that

4327
03:01:52,841 --> 03:01:57,841
criticism and a blanket of these fucking
stupid rules like don't ever talk about

4328
03:01:58,361 --> 03:02:00,520
someone being fat or don't ever discuss
it or don't.

4329
03:02:00,670 --> 03:02:03,220
Don't make them feel uncomfortable about
you're supposed to be on feel

4330
03:02:03,221 --> 03:02:05,530
uncomfortable.
It's something that you can change,

4331
03:02:05,710 --> 03:02:09,520
but if you don't,
it's going to kill you and if you do,

4332
03:02:09,521 --> 03:02:12,370
it's going to make you feel way better.
That's encouragement.

4333
03:02:12,400 --> 03:02:14,980
It's all,
it's the only way to encourage people

4334
03:02:14,981 --> 03:02:17,050
about certain things that are
uncomfortable is to make them

4335
03:02:17,051 --> 03:02:19,630
uncomfortable.
It's just no way around it.

4336
03:02:19,750 --> 03:02:22,930
It's no way someone's going to find out
they're overweight and not have it feel

4337
03:02:22,931 --> 03:02:23,230
bad.

4338
03:02:23,230 --> 03:02:26,470
I think the uncomfortable feeling is
probably like the biggest catalyst.

4339
03:02:26,500 --> 03:02:28,480
Like that's what makes you do stuff.
I think so too,

4340
03:02:28,481 --> 03:02:29,030
man.
I know.

4341
03:02:29,030 --> 03:02:32,110
You know it's an uncomfortable thing.
It's like someone being blue,

4342
03:02:32,140 --> 03:02:36,400
brutally honest with you about something
that you don't like about yourself and

4343
03:02:36,401 --> 03:02:37,760
then you act on it.
Yeah,

4344
03:02:37,790 --> 03:02:38,520
dude,

4345
03:02:38,520 --> 03:02:39,353
I,
I,

4346
03:02:39,860 --> 03:02:44,860
I just think that we,
we definitely could use more nice people

4347
03:02:44,871 --> 03:02:46,790
in the world.
We could definitely use each other being

4348
03:02:47,030 --> 03:02:50,690
kinder and the world for sure,
but when you,

4349
03:02:50,691 --> 03:02:52,520
when you're dealing with certain
situations,

4350
03:02:52,521 --> 03:02:56,090
like at the very least,
you have to be stern with people over

4351
03:02:56,091 --> 03:02:58,370
certain issues.
Like if someone was a drug problem,

4352
03:02:58,580 --> 03:03:00,320
someone has a weight problem.
Yeah.

4353
03:03:00,321 --> 03:03:01,200
I'm not looking at you,
Bert.

4354
03:03:02,090 --> 03:03:03,350
You're fine.
You're doing great.

4355
03:03:03,351 --> 03:03:05,330
The cure a partier.
There's a difference between someone

4356
03:03:05,331 --> 03:03:07,790
who's got a problem,
who's life goes to shit and a guy like

4357
03:03:07,791 --> 03:03:10,700
you worked constantly and also just lost
30 pounds.

4358
03:03:10,701 --> 03:03:12,890
As a matter of fact,
you might be like the perfect drawing

4359
03:03:12,891 --> 03:03:16,670
line in the sand.
Like here's the productive guy that's

4360
03:03:16,671 --> 03:03:18,890
enthusiastic about as partnering,
partying,

4361
03:03:18,891 --> 03:03:23,060
but he's also a great family man.
A great fucking podcasts are a great

4362
03:03:23,061 --> 03:03:24,570
fucking comedian.
You're,

4363
03:03:24,600 --> 03:03:26,660
you're having fun,
you're being very productive.

4364
03:03:26,840 --> 03:03:29,350
You're doing various TV shows and on top
of that you're partying.

4365
03:03:29,460 --> 03:03:30,310
Yeah,
I can.

4366
03:03:30,350 --> 03:03:32,960
This is the line that you get.
Like when is it bad for you?

4367
03:03:32,961 --> 03:03:34,730
When is it destructive to you?
Well,

4368
03:03:34,731 --> 03:03:37,320
when it's good for your life and you're
having a good time as well,

4369
03:03:37,321 --> 03:03:38,690
like you've managed to correctly,

4370
03:03:39,930 --> 03:03:41,410
I think the,
uh,

4371
03:03:42,610 --> 03:03:44,910
so far can I go?
So I was,

4372
03:03:44,920 --> 03:03:47,890
I hadn't been that you're the highest
functioning party guy.

4373
03:03:48,140 --> 03:03:48,970
Yeah.
Hair all over me.

4374
03:03:48,970 --> 03:03:49,990
That's what it is.
For sure.

4375
03:03:50,080 --> 03:03:51,700
I am the highest functioning party guy
probably,

4376
03:03:51,730 --> 03:03:54,970
but I think also just lost 30 fucking
pounds.

4377
03:03:54,971 --> 03:03:56,580
Like an animal dude.
Yeah.

4378
03:03:56,990 --> 03:03:58,130
There's still in hard

4379
03:03:58,130 --> 03:04:01,040
man.
You ran 24 fucking miles in a day or 22

4380
03:04:01,041 --> 03:04:02,180
miles in a day.
Yeah.

4381
03:04:02,210 --> 03:04:03,830
That's hardcore.
Yeah.

4382
03:04:04,360 --> 03:04:05,780
That is hardcore,
man.

4383
03:04:05,781 --> 03:04:07,250
That's not something,
someone who's like,

4384
03:04:07,251 --> 03:04:08,780
oh fuck you tommy bb.
No,

4385
03:04:08,790 --> 03:04:10,670
I'm going to feel depressed.
Like eat.

4386
03:04:10,671 --> 03:04:13,220
Both of you guys are savages.
You buys both Doug,

4387
03:04:13,221 --> 03:04:15,890
you're fucking heels into the ground and
actually did it.

4388
03:04:16,010 --> 03:04:18,260
Yeah.
What you did is super hard to do.

4389
03:04:18,710 --> 03:04:21,110
You lost almost 50 fucking pounds,
dude.

4390
03:04:21,440 --> 03:04:22,550
Yeah.
It's a lot,

4391
03:04:22,551 --> 03:04:23,840
Tommy.
It's insane.

4392
03:04:23,890 --> 03:04:27,070
I know you will lost like a good solid
kettlebell.

4393
03:04:27,240 --> 03:04:29,060
A good one of those big asks and 15

4394
03:04:29,460 --> 03:04:30,440
kettlebell.
Honestly,

4395
03:04:30,520 --> 03:04:32,460
we want to see that picture of mostly
stories again,

4396
03:04:32,490 --> 03:04:34,500
because that doesn't look like the same
human being.

4397
03:04:34,590 --> 03:04:35,400
Dude,
if you,

4398
03:04:35,400 --> 03:04:39,360
if your whole world is going to be a
different thing,

4399
03:04:39,390 --> 03:04:41,430
you're going to be going through life
lighter.

4400
03:04:41,550 --> 03:04:45,030
You'll have better ability to move
through life.

4401
03:04:45,060 --> 03:04:46,920
Like literally like if you,
if I,

4402
03:04:46,921 --> 03:04:48,240
if someone told me,
hey man,

4403
03:04:49,120 --> 03:04:51,720
from how on your jaw?
Oh,

4404
03:04:51,721 --> 03:04:53,380
it's crazy.
Yeah.

4405
03:04:54,120 --> 03:04:55,170
If someone told me,
hey man,

4406
03:04:55,560 --> 03:04:58,650
I'm from here on out,
you're going to be healthy.

4407
03:04:58,680 --> 03:05:00,090
Everything's gonna be great.
You know,

4408
03:05:00,190 --> 03:05:01,710
you're not gonna have to worry about
diseases,

4409
03:05:01,711 --> 03:05:05,370
but you're going to have to wear a 50
pound vest everywhere you go.

4410
03:05:06,870 --> 03:05:07,770
I'd be like,
Shit.

4411
03:05:07,880 --> 03:05:10,020
And then I'd start thinking about the
pressure that's going to put in my lower

4412
03:05:10,021 --> 03:05:13,920
back and on my knees and on my ankles.
And it's exactly what you see from

4413
03:05:13,921 --> 03:05:16,020
overweight people.
It's exactly the issue.

4414
03:05:16,350 --> 03:05:18,330
Yeah.
If you've got to live life with all that

4415
03:05:18,331 --> 03:05:21,270
extra shit,
it requires too much resources,

4416
03:05:21,780 --> 03:05:24,330
but you guys did one of the hardest
things that a person can do.

4417
03:05:24,570 --> 03:05:29,570
You stopped your pattern in its tracks
and you fucking turn the battleship.

4418
03:05:31,260 --> 03:05:35,910
You used your will and your discipline.
You turn the battleship in a competition

4419
03:05:35,911 --> 03:05:39,590
between friends and you both got
healthier because of it maybe

4420
03:05:39,600 --> 03:05:43,530
temporarily unhealthy and the last
couple of days does the dehydration,

4421
03:05:43,830 --> 03:05:45,640
but other than that,
the weight loss.

4422
03:05:45,641 --> 03:05:49,050
How much diet changed since we started
like consuming me?

4423
03:05:49,310 --> 03:05:50,250
It'd be two 27

4424
03:05:51,440 --> 03:05:55,490
but on that much,
100% no Cli mine because I don't want to

4425
03:05:55,491 --> 03:05:57,200
lose the bet to Hari.
No,

4426
03:05:57,201 --> 03:05:57,441
no,
no.

4427
03:05:57,441 --> 03:05:59,110
You're going to wait that it's over man.
You already wait.

4428
03:05:59,111 --> 03:06:03,380
Didn't we already removed Ari from the
equation anywhere you have a drink in

4429
03:06:03,381 --> 03:06:05,150
your hand though?
I've got an idea for it.

4430
03:06:05,870 --> 03:06:09,200
Oh,
Jamie's got an idea how much that's the

4431
03:06:09,201 --> 03:06:10,220
way it is.
Two 27

4432
03:06:12,160 --> 03:06:13,940
you.
How dare you?

4433
03:06:14,030 --> 03:06:19,010
I definitely have put on
and it's water weight man.

4434
03:06:19,140 --> 03:06:21,470
Yeah.
It's bizarre when you wouldn't see what

4435
03:06:21,471 --> 03:06:23,360
you are.
Water weight is,

4436
03:06:23,420 --> 03:06:24,530
I mean,
each one of these things,

4437
03:06:24,531 --> 03:06:25,580
as we said,
is a pound.

4438
03:06:25,581 --> 03:06:26,570
Right?
That's not that bad.

4439
03:06:26,920 --> 03:06:27,753
How much?
About

4440
03:06:29,500 --> 03:06:34,250
nine pounds
in water weight.

4441
03:06:34,290 --> 03:06:36,680
That's insane.
Now here's the thing.

4442
03:06:36,681 --> 03:06:38,600
How bad do you feel?
Have a seat for a second.

4443
03:06:38,780 --> 03:06:39,860
Like,
do you feel bad?

4444
03:06:39,861 --> 03:06:40,370
Like,
you know,

4445
03:06:40,370 --> 03:06:40,971
I feel great,
right?

4446
03:06:40,971 --> 03:06:43,730
You got to go on a foot race right now.
Do you think you'd be okay dude,

4447
03:06:43,731 --> 03:06:45,000
I'm a monster right now.
Okay.

4448
03:06:45,020 --> 03:06:48,200
Really?
I'm being dead serious.

4449
03:06:48,710 --> 03:06:51,890
The Best I've ever felt physically in my
entire life,

4450
03:06:52,100 --> 03:06:54,530
but be,
but even though you just lost all this

4451
03:06:54,531 --> 03:06:56,170
weight,
dehydrated

4452
03:06:56,250 --> 03:06:57,083
yourself,
they didn't.

4453
03:06:57,260 --> 03:06:58,590
I'm,
what I'm asking is like how much have

4454
03:06:58,591 --> 03:07:02,040
you recovered from the way you felt when
you came in to weigh in because he felt

4455
03:07:02,041 --> 03:07:02,640
like shit.
Right?

4456
03:07:02,640 --> 03:07:06,150
I feel so much better since we weighed
in 100% but do you feel like you could

4457
03:07:06,151 --> 03:07:08,000
go run?
Not right now.

4458
03:07:08,010 --> 03:07:09,930
I've loaded with pizza and vodka.
Okay.

4459
03:07:09,931 --> 03:07:12,750
But if you weren't like,
if you it like you feel like physically

4460
03:07:12,751 --> 03:07:16,200
you feel beside just hydrated that I
think,

4461
03:07:16,201 --> 03:07:18,360
I think a lot of times what you're
talking about fat shaming is that people

4462
03:07:18,361 --> 03:07:21,000
don't understand what it feels like to
be on the other side of that.

4463
03:07:21,030 --> 03:07:22,660
You get more vodka?
No,

4464
03:07:23,860 --> 03:07:25,880
it's a,
it's water yesterday.

4465
03:07:27,210 --> 03:07:27,690
Okay,
great.

4466
03:07:27,690 --> 03:07:29,910
Is that I bought a whole case of it.
Couldn't find it in the stores.

4467
03:07:30,840 --> 03:07:33,690
I think you can get it online.
Where'd you get it online?

4468
03:07:33,780 --> 03:07:36,450
I did on Amazon.
It's Stevia flavored soda,

4469
03:07:36,451 --> 03:07:38,710
but it's good.
Zero sugar in it just in Stevia is like

4470
03:07:38,711 --> 03:07:42,930
a natural plant based sweetener so that
doesn't fuck with your blood sugar

4471
03:07:42,931 --> 03:07:43,550
levels.
Yeah,

4472
03:07:43,550 --> 03:07:45,540
it tastes good.
I still don't have to pee.

4473
03:07:46,200 --> 03:07:49,160
That's an amazing,
that's it for bottled water too.

4474
03:07:49,170 --> 03:07:50,850
It's amazing.
You guys are awesome.

4475
03:07:50,851 --> 03:07:53,730
Well you are the water champ though.
I'm going to take a picture of that

4476
03:07:53,731 --> 03:07:56,640
before we leave because it is quite
preposterous because you've had a drink

4477
03:07:56,641 --> 03:07:57,474
too.
Yeah.

4478
03:07:57,660 --> 03:08:00,570
So Tommy's consent to these biggest
commissions,

4479
03:08:00,600 --> 03:08:02,610
just kill it like a grownup.
No,

4480
03:08:02,611 --> 03:08:04,800
that's a sip.
Like are those 16 ounce cans?

4481
03:08:04,860 --> 03:08:07,980
How many ounces are in those cans of c
two o coconut water?

4482
03:08:08,730 --> 03:08:13,200
These are 17.5 Jesus Christ,
he killed two of those and then for 16

4483
03:08:13,201 --> 03:08:14,670
ounce waters.
Yeah,

4484
03:08:14,671 --> 03:08:16,500
I'm on number five by the way,
if you're one of those people that's

4485
03:08:16,501 --> 03:08:16,921
like,
oh,

4486
03:08:16,921 --> 03:08:19,950
coconut water tastes like toilet water.
No,

4487
03:08:20,010 --> 03:08:21,510
it tastes like jazz and it's delicious.

4488
03:08:23,730 --> 03:08:25,920
Hey is a coconut.
You're allowed to just steal that and

4489
03:08:25,921 --> 03:08:28,380
put that in an ad.
If you want to get the right coconut

4490
03:08:28,381 --> 03:08:29,910
water,
you got to get it from Thai,

4491
03:08:30,310 --> 03:08:31,730
Thai coconuts.
The best one.

4492
03:08:31,740 --> 03:08:33,030
That's a very sweet.
Yeah.

4493
03:08:33,190 --> 03:08:36,900
If you ever had the Tiki ones that are
Mocha that have caffeine in them,

4494
03:08:37,380 --> 03:08:38,970
those are really good too.
Like yeah,

4495
03:08:38,971 --> 03:08:41,280
those are good too,
but those have a lot of sugar in them,

4496
03:08:41,670 --> 03:08:42,660
unfortunately.
I mean,

4497
03:08:42,661 --> 03:08:45,000
they're really Yummy,
but they do have a lot of sugar in them.

4498
03:08:45,120 --> 03:08:47,940
You know what really is the bass like
there's a company that has it or it's

4499
03:08:47,941 --> 03:08:49,740
fresh coconut water.
Is that the one that,

4500
03:08:50,440 --> 03:08:52,020
yeah,
it's a harmless harvest

4501
03:08:55,890 --> 03:08:57,760
coconut water and you drink it.
It's just like it.

4502
03:08:57,800 --> 03:09:00,210
Your whole body's just going to make a
coffee flavored one.

4503
03:09:00,211 --> 03:09:02,130
They have a copy of flavor that's a
different one.

4504
03:09:02,190 --> 03:09:03,330
That's different one.
But yeah,

4505
03:09:03,430 --> 03:09:05,700
and the coconut waters.
Unbelievable.

4506
03:09:05,730 --> 03:09:08,280
People get mad if you start talking
about coconut water or Kale.

4507
03:09:08,840 --> 03:09:11,550
You're the person that introduced me to
coconut water yesterday.

4508
03:09:12,700 --> 03:09:14,790
It looks good and I'm actually already
used to it.

4509
03:09:14,820 --> 03:09:16,550
I'm used to it already too.
It's all bullshit,

4510
03:09:16,560 --> 03:09:17,393
man.
All right guys.

4511
03:09:17,460 --> 03:09:18,650
Listen man.
When I was scared,

4512
03:09:18,651 --> 03:09:19,680
shaved my head,
I was,

4513
03:09:19,830 --> 03:09:22,650
before I shaved my head,
I was thinking about it for like a

4514
03:09:22,650 --> 03:09:22,861
couple of days.
I was like,

4515
03:09:22,861 --> 03:09:25,170
should I do this?
Should I shaved my fucking head?

4516
03:09:25,430 --> 03:09:28,860
Cause it was just getting more and more
Janky looking up there.

4517
03:09:29,140 --> 03:09:31,170
It was just giving out.
I was,

4518
03:09:31,260 --> 03:09:35,010
I was you in five years and I was like,
it's almost over.

4519
03:09:35,040 --> 03:09:38,790
I just got to give in.
And then when I finally fucking changed

4520
03:09:38,791 --> 03:09:39,450
it,
I was like,

4521
03:09:39,450 --> 03:09:40,650
God damn it.
What was I,

4522
03:09:40,920 --> 03:09:42,360
why did I shave it a long time ago?

4523
03:09:42,360 --> 03:09:44,910
This is way better.
It's way easier.

4524
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:46,530
He had just looked different,
right?

4525
03:09:46,840 --> 03:09:47,760
Like,
and people are,

4526
03:09:47,761 --> 03:09:50,250
everyone's,
we're all afraid of looking different

4527
03:09:50,251 --> 03:09:51,890
for some weird reason.
Yeah.

4528
03:09:52,210 --> 03:09:53,470
Down there.
Yeah,

4529
03:09:53,980 --> 03:09:54,910
it's different.
It's better,

4530
03:09:55,240 --> 03:09:56,260
you know.
But I do,

4531
03:09:56,261 --> 03:09:57,940
look,
I feel like I work at deadwood,

4532
03:09:57,941 --> 03:10:00,490
but on the south side this will be
great.

4533
03:10:00,670 --> 03:10:03,010
Here's one that actually the big things
about how this,

4534
03:10:03,011 --> 03:10:06,160
it turned out because you've lost so
much weight.

4535
03:10:06,760 --> 03:10:11,760
The impact is not like if you had been
full two 50 [inaudible] oh my goodness.

4536
03:10:12,430 --> 03:10:14,590
It would look worse.
But you lost 30 some pounds,

4537
03:10:14,680 --> 03:10:16,240
so it actually,
you know,

4538
03:10:16,300 --> 03:10:19,060
did she keep it?
I think that mustache looks good.

4539
03:10:19,120 --> 03:10:23,980
I think the mustache at the very least
should stay at chin hair.

4540
03:10:24,280 --> 03:10:26,080
But kind of what I'm,
I really want to it.

4541
03:10:26,170 --> 03:10:29,680
I really want to use a razor raised on
like 12 years.

4542
03:10:30,810 --> 03:10:33,460
They've been going go get a real shave.
Ooh.

4543
03:10:33,480 --> 03:10:34,920
Yeah.
Go to a barber and you know,

4544
03:10:35,110 --> 03:10:37,030
sit in the chair.
And you already said one time black

4545
03:10:37,031 --> 03:10:38,470
barber.
I went to a black barber,

4546
03:10:38,471 --> 03:10:40,690
but he's just trimmed my beard.
Well go there again and you'll trim your

4547
03:10:40,691 --> 03:10:42,650
beard.
Get up real shave.

4548
03:10:42,870 --> 03:10:46,270
Yeah.
Do you guys feel better after this is

4549
03:10:46,271 --> 03:10:48,970
all over or do you feel physically
drained today?

4550
03:10:48,971 --> 03:10:50,170
I'm really tired,
man.

4551
03:10:50,800 --> 03:10:52,680
But we also stood dehydration.
Right.

4552
03:10:52,681 --> 03:10:56,890
But that was row that I like that.
What the drugs and alcohol.

4553
03:10:56,960 --> 03:10:58,270
Oh yeah,
that's your favorite part.

4554
03:10:58,271 --> 03:11:00,620
But I mean like up until then,
um,

4555
03:11:00,670 --> 03:11:02,620
you rehydrate it a little bit before you
start boozing.

4556
03:11:02,621 --> 03:11:04,300
Right?
Didn't you correct a lot.

4557
03:11:04,330 --> 03:11:05,590
But,
uh,

4558
03:11:06,850 --> 03:11:09,400
I feel fantastic right now.
I feel really good cause I feel like

4559
03:11:09,401 --> 03:11:12,160
I've earned a lot of stuff.
Like today I had two pieces of pizza.

4560
03:11:12,490 --> 03:11:14,020
This is the way my brain's working right
now,

4561
03:11:14,021 --> 03:11:16,570
but I already know that I've burned,
um,

4562
03:11:16,810 --> 03:11:19,570
all my fitbit or just a,
no,

4563
03:11:19,571 --> 03:11:24,571
it's not.
I've burned a 3,200 calories already.

4564
03:11:25,120 --> 03:11:25,781
Damn.
Dude,

4565
03:11:25,781 --> 03:11:26,614
this morning.
Wow,

4566
03:11:26,740 --> 03:11:28,030
that's amazing.
So,

4567
03:11:28,630 --> 03:11:29,520
um,
my,

4568
03:11:29,620 --> 03:11:30,940
I,
I'm excited for like,

4569
03:11:30,941 --> 03:11:31,631
uh,
to make,

4570
03:11:31,631 --> 03:11:32,730
I get these,
the,

4571
03:11:32,750 --> 03:11:36,400
these styrofoam cups he started to,
and I'm deciding to make a big ice water

4572
03:11:36,430 --> 03:11:39,040
and sit.
Why don't you guys have a Jujitsu match?

4573
03:11:40,450 --> 03:11:44,470
Why don't you guys train for three
months and have a Jujitsu match?

4574
03:11:46,940 --> 03:11:48,960
When did that.
Oh Man,

4575
03:11:49,800 --> 03:11:51,360
I'll do that.
That's what I'm talking about.

4576
03:11:51,620 --> 03:11:53,340
But we need coaches though.
Oh,

4577
03:11:53,940 --> 03:11:55,020
we can get you those.

4578
03:11:55,900 --> 03:11:56,380
Okay.

4579
03:11:56,380 --> 03:11:57,370
Okay,
that's good.

4580
03:11:57,460 --> 03:11:57,870
Wait,
but,

4581
03:11:57,870 --> 03:12:01,330
but I like hundred and 50 grand on the
line.

4582
03:12:03,740 --> 03:12:08,740
We might be able to get that.
We might be able to get that.

4583
03:12:11,430 --> 03:12:12,820
Okay.
Is there a second place?

4584
03:12:13,900 --> 03:12:17,990
A second place?
What are some of the second place kid?

4585
03:12:18,610 --> 03:12:21,610
You start play scared.
It was the loser was the loser.

4586
03:12:21,611 --> 03:12:23,890
Get nothing does a winner.
When I get something to lose,

4587
03:12:23,891 --> 03:12:25,360
he gets dog shit.
They get nothing.

4588
03:12:25,361 --> 03:12:26,210
Zero.
I Dunno.

4589
03:12:26,470 --> 03:12:29,290
It seems usually how it works.
It seems exploitative.

4590
03:12:29,530 --> 03:12:30,311
Oh really?
Yeah.

4591
03:12:30,311 --> 03:12:33,580
I think the winter should get more.
The should get less,

4592
03:12:33,581 --> 03:12:36,190
but the losers,
the losers should be compensated just

4593
03:12:36,191 --> 03:12:37,360
for competing.
Yeah.

4594
03:12:37,570 --> 03:12:39,790
I got you.
What if a,

4595
03:12:39,791 --> 03:12:42,640
the loser gets the loser gets to go on
the trip and this,

4596
03:12:43,030 --> 03:12:43,870
well,
this is the case.

4597
03:12:43,871 --> 03:12:46,570
Like it's not like you guys are betting
150,000 hours.

4598
03:12:47,030 --> 03:12:49,330
This is that Ari is the,
the,

4599
03:12:49,331 --> 03:12:52,340
the WHO's the,
what's it my friend and I must protect

4600
03:12:52,341 --> 03:12:56,000
him from his tendencies.
So I will assume the fiduciary aspects

4601
03:12:56,001 --> 03:12:58,670
of this negotiation from here on out.
Thank you.

4602
03:12:59,710 --> 03:13:01,070
Uh,
it's the,

4603
03:13:01,071 --> 03:13:01,940
what's,
what was John,

4604
03:13:01,941 --> 03:13:05,450
what was John Travolta in the,
in that movie get shorty?

4605
03:13:05,690 --> 03:13:07,730
He was the vig parties.
The vig.

4606
03:13:08,140 --> 03:13:08,973
Okay.

4607
03:13:09,330 --> 03:13:12,000
John Travolta was in g get shorty.
He was a,

4608
03:13:13,320 --> 03:13:15,330
he was a bookie.
I don't remember that movie at all.

4609
03:13:15,360 --> 03:13:17,180
Why?
I remember that niche shows and movie

4610
03:13:17,760 --> 03:13:19,620
came out and was up to me.
He's like,

4611
03:13:19,621 --> 03:13:22,380
I want to be a Hollywood producer.
And he wrote a script.

4612
03:13:22,440 --> 03:13:22,981
God,
Dad,

4613
03:13:22,981 --> 03:13:25,770
why am I having such a hard time
remembering that movie where he has or

4614
03:13:25,771 --> 03:13:26,820
he has the script?
He's like,

4615
03:13:26,850 --> 03:13:28,360
he's like,
I'm the producer of this.

4616
03:13:28,380 --> 03:13:31,410
A few of those movies that you fucking
loved when they came out like a bronx

4617
03:13:31,411 --> 03:13:32,360
tale.
Yeah.

4618
03:13:32,400 --> 03:13:33,900
Fantastic.
And then you watch it on TV.

4619
03:13:33,901 --> 03:13:37,050
Like why is this completely gone from my
memory dude?

4620
03:13:37,470 --> 03:13:41,670
And this House Hackman is so fucking
funny in this movie.

4621
03:13:41,830 --> 03:13:44,370
I got to see that movie.
Or He's so 90,

4622
03:13:44,371 --> 03:13:45,660
what was it?
95.

4623
03:13:45,980 --> 03:13:47,910
Wow.
You remember that Gene Hackman scene

4624
03:13:47,940 --> 03:13:48,491
with the,
uh,

4625
03:13:48,491 --> 03:13:50,310
the guy that died?
Um,

4626
03:13:50,340 --> 03:13:55,340
who cop the former cop plays that he
plays that Miami gangster in this movie

4627
03:13:56,910 --> 03:13:59,370
and he flies out to get his money from
him.

4628
03:13:59,400 --> 03:14:02,790
From Gene Hackman.
Look at how good the man,

4629
03:14:02,830 --> 03:14:04,780
I don't remember this fucking movie at
all.

4630
03:14:04,781 --> 03:14:06,870
It is a high possibility that I'd never
saw.

4631
03:14:06,900 --> 03:14:07,900
Oh No.
I saw this movie.

4632
03:14:08,470 --> 03:14:10,630
I remember that violence is equal to
various,

4633
03:14:10,840 --> 03:14:15,490
that's the Guy Dennis for isn't it fast?
He's so fucking funny in that.

4634
03:14:15,550 --> 03:14:17,950
Oh,
he's funny and everything that he died

4635
03:14:17,951 --> 03:14:20,260
recently.
Delroy Lindo is my favorite black and

4636
03:14:20,310 --> 03:14:22,330
yellow fever.
Jamesy that they'd beat him up.

4637
03:14:23,230 --> 03:14:24,250
Oh Jesus Christ.

4638
03:14:25,880 --> 03:14:27,250
I should watch that again.
Yes,

4639
03:14:27,251 --> 03:14:29,360
that's great.
We should do a fight companion.

4640
03:14:29,390 --> 03:14:31,730
We watch it.
We should watch.

4641
03:14:32,360 --> 03:14:33,021
Yeah,
let's watch.

4642
03:14:33,021 --> 03:14:34,550
Get shorty into beer,
man.

4643
03:14:34,560 --> 03:14:37,160
He'd have a couple of drinks.
Get Baked and watch.

4644
03:14:37,161 --> 03:14:40,010
Get Shorty and talk shit.
We'll tell people to sync it up.

4645
03:14:40,310 --> 03:14:41,210
Let's do one.
Hey,

4646
03:14:41,211 --> 03:14:44,660
let's fucking do that for real.
I haven't seen this movie and forever.

4647
03:14:44,690 --> 03:14:47,420
Let's do it.
I barely remember anything in this

4648
03:14:47,421 --> 03:14:49,550
movie.
Like I might've seen this movie when it

4649
03:14:49,551 --> 03:14:51,830
came out and completely forgot about it.
Since then.

4650
03:14:52,130 --> 03:14:54,920
I've never seen it since.
So it'll be a total surprise if Jamie

4651
03:14:54,921 --> 03:14:57,150
kills these previous calibrator.
Yes.

4652
03:14:57,290 --> 03:15:00,320
Let's do one with Ryan Reynolds for a
van wilder.

4653
03:15:00,890 --> 03:15:02,150
Do you want to do that?
Yeah,

4654
03:15:02,200 --> 03:15:04,070
I is that going to be weird because you
haven't seen it.

4655
03:15:04,490 --> 03:15:05,450
Have you seen it?
No,

4656
03:15:05,451 --> 03:15:08,060
I've never seen it.
You never saw the movie that was based

4657
03:15:08,061 --> 03:15:11,270
on a story about your life in college?

4658
03:15:11,570 --> 03:15:15,050
That seems crazy to me too,
if we're going to be honest about it.

4659
03:15:15,170 --> 03:15:15,831
Yeah.
You know,

4660
03:15:15,831 --> 03:15:18,410
I never could.
I never had the validation that I had

4661
03:15:18,411 --> 03:15:22,280
now in my life where his company,
he says that that's what it was based

4662
03:15:22,281 --> 03:15:24,590
on.
So I'd take it say it on radio and so I

4663
03:15:24,591 --> 03:15:26,900
didn't want to ever watch it,
so I felt like I was lying.

4664
03:15:27,050 --> 03:15:28,610
Did they pay,
you know number?

4665
03:15:29,910 --> 03:15:31,640
That could be fun.
Awkward moment.

4666
03:15:32,060 --> 03:15:33,560
No,
but I think Ryan Reynolds is into it.

4667
03:15:33,970 --> 03:15:37,970
I mean it's company says he's into it.
I think he'd be into it,

4668
03:15:38,690 --> 03:15:43,220
into watching it live with us.
We all get baked and have a few drinks.

4669
03:15:43,730 --> 03:15:45,080
I don't remember.
I don't know Ryan.

4670
03:15:45,081 --> 03:15:46,280
I'm not sure.
I don't know him either.

4671
03:15:46,430 --> 03:15:47,940
I don't know why he'd invite them.
You don't even know him.

4672
03:15:47,941 --> 03:15:50,340
I like the assumption that he'd be like
into it.

4673
03:15:50,550 --> 03:15:53,160
Well they said they do loves gets baked
on the Internet.

4674
03:15:53,190 --> 03:15:56,910
They said he's a regular guest.
They said he'd do it on my podcast and I

4675
03:15:56,911 --> 03:15:57,744
was like,
I do it.

4676
03:15:57,780 --> 03:16:01,470
Definitely do that.
Who in who like took your story and

4677
03:16:01,471 --> 03:16:03,380
brought over there and profited from it?
Oh,

4678
03:16:03,540 --> 03:16:06,570
some writer and there's,
there was never an issue because it

4679
03:16:06,571 --> 03:16:10,320
wasn't really you as based on you or
stories about you that they added a

4680
03:16:10,321 --> 03:16:11,220
bunch of 'em.

4681
03:16:11,310 --> 03:16:14,610
The option was made by a company,
by an agency,

4682
03:16:14,760 --> 03:16:19,590
a literary agency and they uh,
took it and they sold it with me and the

4683
03:16:21,540 --> 03:16:25,980
writer of the article attached.
So the are the movie had to be about a

4684
03:16:26,220 --> 03:16:28,800
journalist writing an article about a
party animal.

4685
03:16:29,140 --> 03:16:32,430
That was the caveat.
So then I got,

4686
03:16:32,560 --> 03:16:36,990
I discovered by will smith and that deal
fell apart and the oliver stone deal

4687
03:16:36,991 --> 03:16:39,360
fall apart.
And then one of the producers are one of

4688
03:16:39,361 --> 03:16:43,890
the writers who had submitted scripts or
send a script in and it was moving

4689
03:16:43,891 --> 03:16:46,200
forward and they thought that was gonna
be the one when it fell apart,

4690
03:16:46,201 --> 03:16:49,020
he just took it and sold it.
The Van Monitor or to national lampoon

4691
03:16:49,350 --> 03:16:52,080
and they made a van mater.
Wow.

4692
03:16:52,140 --> 03:16:55,380
Yeah.
So I didn't really have any attachment

4693
03:16:55,381 --> 03:16:57,780
to any of it.
I never got paid for any of it and I

4694
03:16:57,781 --> 03:16:59,790
didn't make any of it.
But at the same time,

4695
03:17:00,630 --> 03:17:05,230
like my best friend in college,
his name's in the movie and so like,

4696
03:17:05,470 --> 03:17:07,370
like so weird.
Yeah.

4697
03:17:07,710 --> 03:17:10,440
But I don't,
I have no bitterness towards it.

4698
03:17:10,441 --> 03:17:11,670
I don't care.
I don't give a fuck.

4699
03:17:11,910 --> 03:17:12,620
Well,
that's good.

4700
03:17:12,620 --> 03:17:14,790
So it's a little sidebar to your,
to your life.

4701
03:17:14,940 --> 03:17:16,590
We put,
don't stop putting on shit.

4702
03:17:16,591 --> 03:17:17,490
I gotta get going.
No.

4703
03:17:17,491 --> 03:17:19,050
Why?
Where we've got a podcast today.

4704
03:17:19,310 --> 03:17:20,120
Yeah.
What?

4705
03:17:20,120 --> 03:17:21,740
You did one yesterday?
I'm not doing one.

4706
03:17:23,420 --> 03:17:24,740
What do you have to go?
Where are you going?

4707
03:17:24,800 --> 03:17:25,820
Uh,
I'm just ready to go.

4708
03:17:27,110 --> 03:17:29,120
Why do you do that?
I would never do that.

4709
03:17:29,150 --> 03:17:31,180
Why?
PODCASTS is ain't no result.

4710
03:17:31,220 --> 03:17:32,053
Yeah,
man.

4711
03:17:32,080 --> 03:17:32,531
What,
what,

4712
03:17:32,531 --> 03:17:33,890
what,
what time are we at right now?

4713
03:17:34,020 --> 03:17:34,730
It's,
um,

4714
03:17:34,730 --> 03:17:37,100
we're about three hours in.
How many minutes?

4715
03:17:37,101 --> 03:17:38,950
10.
Three 17 three.

4716
03:17:38,970 --> 03:17:41,240
Well,
we gotta do another 12 minutes at least

4717
03:17:41,260 --> 03:17:44,030
to ramp it up to the,
at the top of the hour.

4718
03:17:44,480 --> 03:17:46,270
Top of the top of the hour.
Okay.

4719
03:17:46,670 --> 03:17:48,890
Well how do you get like that?
That's just how I am.

4720
03:17:49,080 --> 03:17:50,660
Wow.
You guys are funny.

4721
03:17:50,661 --> 03:17:53,180
This is like impulsive versus
discipline.

4722
03:17:53,390 --> 03:17:55,970
This is slow,
steady marathon versus sprint.

4723
03:17:55,990 --> 03:17:58,800
I love your drunk.
Yeah.

4724
03:18:00,650 --> 03:18:04,070
Not both are virtuous.
Does virtue in both?

4725
03:18:04,090 --> 03:18:06,470
Yeah.
Both of our strategies will pay

4726
03:18:06,800 --> 03:18:08,840
dividends.
They both will bear fruit.

4727
03:18:09,380 --> 03:18:11,600
We should do a tour together when I get
famous,

4728
03:18:12,010 --> 03:18:13,570
because you guys just show,
uh,

4729
03:18:14,210 --> 03:18:17,330
you guys are so opposite ends of this
spectrum.

4730
03:18:18,800 --> 03:18:20,540
When do you get famous?
You guys should do a tour together.

4731
03:18:22,490 --> 03:18:23,850
No,
you don't think your family,

4732
03:18:23,870 --> 03:18:25,070
you don't think people would know who
you are.

4733
03:18:25,250 --> 03:18:27,420
You just told me about the rams game
where some guy yelled out the

4734
03:18:27,421 --> 03:18:30,020
[inaudible] pull.
People didn't stop doing it.

4735
03:18:30,260 --> 03:18:32,440
I my,
I wore my name on the back of my chair.

4736
03:18:33,210 --> 03:18:34,043
Right.

4737
03:18:34,220 --> 03:18:35,300
Uh,
no.

4738
03:18:35,390 --> 03:18:39,530
I know you're a good level of fame dude.
Fuck fame.

4739
03:18:39,560 --> 03:18:40,610
I like,
I like,

4740
03:18:40,611 --> 03:18:43,040
uh,
I'm being dead serious when I say this.

4741
03:18:43,041 --> 03:18:46,130
I love the way people that don't know
that I'm friends with Tom.

4742
03:18:46,131 --> 03:18:47,510
I love the way they talking about stand
up.

4743
03:18:47,860 --> 03:18:48,040
Like

4744
03:18:48,040 --> 03:18:49,450
when we were there,
like there's,

4745
03:18:49,451 --> 03:18:51,100
I'll say something about you.
And they'll go,

4746
03:18:51,430 --> 03:18:52,330
oh,
you don't have top scorer.

4747
03:18:52,390 --> 03:18:54,400
Oh my God.
Like his standup's fuck.

4748
03:18:54,401 --> 03:18:55,234
I just,
my favorite,

4749
03:18:55,420 --> 03:18:57,340
it's my favorite special ever.
Most of the stories,

4750
03:18:57,460 --> 03:18:58,990
my favorite special ever.
I love that.

4751
03:18:58,991 --> 03:19:00,300
That's what I like.
Yeah.

4752
03:19:00,340 --> 03:19:04,570
It's always nice when you can tap into a
bunch of people that kind of feel about

4753
03:19:04,571 --> 03:19:05,770
somebody the way you feel about them.
Yep.

4754
03:19:05,860 --> 03:19:10,090
Bill Berman has been my favorite person
because we all can agree he's maybe our

4755
03:19:10,091 --> 03:19:12,310
favorite guy doing stand up right now.
But Man,

4756
03:19:12,330 --> 03:19:13,660
uh,
I love him.

4757
03:19:15,110 --> 03:19:18,820
Tommy just gave the end,
met some med sand he's mate.

4758
03:19:20,280 --> 03:19:23,020
Yeah,
he's definitely in this like rare group

4759
03:19:23,021 --> 03:19:26,050
of people that I seek out to watch to
stand up.

4760
03:19:26,070 --> 03:19:30,280
This is tremendous man and I think
there's also like,

4761
03:19:30,281 --> 03:19:32,860
it's a really good thing like just like
you guys were talking about the

4762
03:19:32,861 --> 03:19:36,160
competition of a,
the weight loss and the fun inspiring

4763
03:19:36,161 --> 03:19:36,700
you.

4764
03:19:36,700 --> 03:19:40,090
There's at least some sort of a
unconscious competition when you're

4765
03:19:40,091 --> 03:19:42,100
surrounded by people that are really
funny.

4766
03:19:42,370 --> 03:19:44,410
Yeah,
and like where we're at store.

4767
03:19:44,500 --> 03:19:45,131
Yeah,
man.

4768
03:19:45,131 --> 03:19:49,390
Right where we're at right now,
today in la in 2017 is a really rare

4769
03:19:49,391 --> 03:19:52,570
time where this is like we're surrounded
by killers,

4770
03:19:52,660 --> 03:19:53,760
you know,
and guys,

4771
03:19:53,860 --> 03:19:56,020
people don't even know like Owen Smith,
you ever see Owen Smith,

4772
03:19:56,021 --> 03:19:57,910
the comedy store?
It's been a while.

4773
03:19:57,940 --> 03:20:00,960
Fucking hilarious.
Santinello you've seen sandy.

4774
03:20:00,970 --> 03:20:04,060
We talked about him yesterday.
I want to hear Marius.

4775
03:20:04,360 --> 03:20:09,360
There's a gang of these kids and men and
women and know a bunch of people coming

4776
03:20:09,641 --> 03:20:11,080
up.
There's a bunch of people coming up that

4777
03:20:11,081 --> 03:20:13,060
are really fucking funny.
Yeah,

4778
03:20:13,360 --> 03:20:15,010
it's a,
it's an awesome time,

4779
03:20:15,011 --> 03:20:17,170
man.
I worked with a bunch of dudes that are

4780
03:20:17,171 --> 03:20:19,430
super funny that come with me now.
Uh,

4781
03:20:19,630 --> 03:20:21,610
Josh Potter.
Have you done with him yet?

4782
03:20:21,740 --> 03:20:23,940
But he stinks.
I just like,

4783
03:20:23,941 --> 03:20:27,100
I know for what it's like to be Josh
Potter right now and hear your name

4784
03:20:27,101 --> 03:20:29,170
brought up on a podcast and go and then
go,

4785
03:20:29,290 --> 03:20:30,310
oh,
what would they shit on me?

4786
03:20:30,340 --> 03:20:31,890
No,
I won't charge.

4787
03:20:31,891 --> 03:20:34,750
You haven't seen him in forever.
He's with me in a West Palm.

4788
03:20:34,751 --> 03:20:36,860
Can you take a trial with you?
I love that guy.

4789
03:20:36,980 --> 03:20:40,540
Take full charge a bunch.
Full Chatham House is a good man.

4790
03:20:40,810 --> 03:20:41,920
You've had Jeff Haden,
right?

4791
03:20:41,980 --> 03:20:43,210
Nope.
You've never had a one?

4792
03:20:43,240 --> 03:20:44,810
Nope.
Never had a job aid on.

4793
03:20:45,230 --> 03:20:46,000
Nope.
Yup.

4794
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:46,833
Yeah.
Great.

4795
03:20:46,860 --> 03:20:48,840
There's a lot of good ones.
Um,

4796
03:20:48,910 --> 03:20:52,120
I took drawn Horton with me to a,
the comedy works in Denver.

4797
03:20:52,150 --> 03:20:53,650
How was that?
Fucking great.

4798
03:20:53,680 --> 03:20:54,910
He's a funny dude,
man.

4799
03:20:55,070 --> 03:20:56,860
And it was also funny dude,
Josh Martin.

4800
03:20:56,890 --> 03:20:59,650
Josh is fucking hilarious.
Hilarious dude.

4801
03:20:59,651 --> 03:21:01,240
He says my funny shit.
I was like,

4802
03:21:01,241 --> 03:21:02,440
Hey,
you should do the road more.

4803
03:21:02,440 --> 03:21:05,740
And he's like,
why can't get off Thursdays or Sundays?

4804
03:21:06,190 --> 03:21:06,701
And I was like,
well,

4805
03:21:06,701 --> 03:21:08,730
that's the row.
Like I was like,

4806
03:21:08,740 --> 03:21:09,940
we were just bullshitting.
I was like,

4807
03:21:09,970 --> 03:21:11,980
well,
that's the part of the time I beat you.

4808
03:21:12,790 --> 03:21:14,290
The nights,
I don't want to do it either.

4809
03:21:14,500 --> 03:21:16,510
Right.
Carlos Valencia,

4810
03:21:16,540 --> 03:21:17,680
you know him.
Yeah.

4811
03:21:17,740 --> 03:21:19,150
Super Funny.
Super Fun.

4812
03:21:19,720 --> 03:21:22,870
Like the,
the 2017 roster,

4813
03:21:22,871 --> 03:21:25,570
like the people that are coming up right
now that people are just starting to get

4814
03:21:25,571 --> 03:21:26,404
to know him.
Yeah.

4815
03:21:26,590 --> 03:21:30,490
They're the most educated in all of like
the young group of comics that are

4816
03:21:30,491 --> 03:21:33,040
coming up because all of them,
you know,

4817
03:21:33,041 --> 03:21:36,580
all these young men and women that are
getting into stand up now,

4818
03:21:36,581 --> 03:21:39,580
they've,
they've experienced the whole internet

4819
03:21:39,581 --> 03:21:42,430
boom during their adolescence.
You know,

4820
03:21:42,460 --> 03:21:45,130
like the big grew up with it,
but the comedy fans,

4821
03:21:45,260 --> 03:21:46,220
comedy fans

4822
03:21:46,220 --> 03:21:49,220
and the Internet boom is allowed them to
have access to everything.

4823
03:21:49,640 --> 03:21:50,660
I was,
when we were kids,

4824
03:21:50,810 --> 03:21:52,950
we'd have to go find a bill cosby album.
Yeah.

4825
03:21:53,140 --> 03:21:55,190
You know,
we used to have to find a kinison

4826
03:21:55,191 --> 03:21:59,450
cassette or a dice cassette.
We had to go find a Richard Pryor CD,

4827
03:21:59,480 --> 03:22:00,340
you know?
Yeah.

4828
03:22:00,830 --> 03:22:02,570
It was hard.
You had to go seek it out.

4829
03:22:02,571 --> 03:22:06,380
Like now it's instantly the moment you
get it in your head that I would like to

4830
03:22:06,381 --> 03:22:09,260
see some comedy.
Almost everyone has some kind of a

4831
03:22:09,261 --> 03:22:14,261
computer today to remember when you said
that when I used to open for Bert and

4832
03:22:15,261 --> 03:22:16,960
like really early on,
uh,

4833
03:22:17,540 --> 03:22:21,740
see how it hard he would kill like he
kills so much harder than most people

4834
03:22:21,741 --> 03:22:26,741
can understand and I would try to mimic
some version of what he was doing,

4835
03:22:28,280 --> 03:22:31,370
you know what I mean?
Cause like hit such this energy energy

4836
03:22:31,371 --> 03:22:32,450
and his the way he is.

4837
03:22:32,460 --> 03:22:35,030
So I'll go up there and I do my act but
I'd be like,

4838
03:22:35,310 --> 03:22:37,250
Ugh,
like,

4839
03:22:38,540 --> 03:22:41,450
like he does.
And like I had a friend who was like,

4840
03:22:41,840 --> 03:22:44,390
hey man,
you look real crazy up there right now.

4841
03:22:44,690 --> 03:22:48,390
He told me afterwards it's good.
Trying to be like best the best.

4842
03:22:49,160 --> 03:22:53,120
Maybe my favorite time in my friendship
with he is when uh,

4843
03:22:53,930 --> 03:22:58,930
when you bombed in Sacramento.
I've never enjoyed like,

4844
03:22:59,001 --> 03:23:01,580
you know,
like it's a real bad bomb too.

4845
03:23:01,670 --> 03:23:05,210
It was like what started it?
Not a rape joke,

4846
03:23:07,640 --> 03:23:12,640
but
it was good,

4847
03:23:12,770 --> 03:23:15,350
at least tasteful,
well it was,

4848
03:23:15,650 --> 03:23:18,600
I wasn't like endorsing it.
I was making it.

4849
03:23:18,740 --> 03:23:20,100
It was,
it was,

4850
03:23:20,101 --> 03:23:22,560
uh,
it was,

4851
03:23:22,730 --> 03:23:27,730
you remember Hurricane Katrina
happened and there were stories that,

4852
03:23:28,490 --> 03:23:33,490
that I think that and this,
all the chaos people were getting raped

4853
03:23:34,880 --> 03:23:38,300
and I opened with something like
something like,

4854
03:23:38,301 --> 03:23:40,730
you know,
there's nothing like a floating corpse

4855
03:23:40,731 --> 03:23:42,540
to get me in the mood to fuck somebody.

4856
03:23:43,180 --> 03:23:45,560
Right.
Then I would elaborate on the story and

4857
03:23:45,800 --> 03:23:50,800
have joked that it would started there
and it was the early show Friday and I

4858
03:23:52,071 --> 03:23:54,950
mean that now I did that and I get a
laugh and I'm telling you it's a full

4859
03:23:54,951 --> 03:23:59,951
house.
I got no laughs for the next 22 and a

4860
03:24:00,291 --> 03:24:03,380
half minutes and I know it was 22 and a
half minutes because I was supposed to

4861
03:24:03,381 --> 03:24:05,480
do 25 by the way.
Tom had his hair,

4862
03:24:05,510 --> 03:24:07,700
his hair was long at the time it was
like a comb over.

4863
03:24:08,090 --> 03:24:10,220
And what would happen is slowly as he
worked,

4864
03:24:10,221 --> 03:24:12,380
it would flatten onto his hat on his
head,

4865
03:24:12,440 --> 03:24:14,090
on his face,
and just be wet.

4866
03:24:14,540 --> 03:24:15,860
And I'm sweating a lot,
man.

4867
03:24:15,980 --> 03:24:18,050
And then when I got upstaged the lady
goes,

4868
03:24:18,290 --> 03:24:20,840
I thought you were supposed to be funny.
And I was like,

4869
03:24:20,880 --> 03:24:22,120
ah,
you know,

4870
03:24:22,130 --> 03:24:24,200
cause you're just like so vulnerable.

4871
03:24:24,200 --> 03:24:25,011
You're like,
where's The lady?

4872
03:24:25,011 --> 03:24:27,680
The booker and you've managed it.
And uh,

4873
03:24:27,830 --> 03:24:29,330
did you do any other sets there that
week?

4874
03:24:29,390 --> 03:24:31,880
Oh wait,
there's a 10 o'clock show,

4875
03:24:32,390 --> 03:24:35,960
10 o'clock show.
I opened the same way and I bombed just

4876
03:24:35,961 --> 03:24:39,770
as hard back to back 25 minute sets just
as hard.

4877
03:24:40,890 --> 03:24:44,130
And then I remember the host goes,
I've never seen a feature bomb like

4878
03:24:44,131 --> 03:24:44,964
that.
Like he was,

4879
03:24:45,210 --> 03:24:46,860
he was,
and he was the MC.

4880
03:24:47,340 --> 03:24:50,640
And then I really was like,
you know,

4881
03:24:50,641 --> 03:24:53,040
like having to lie to myself at the
hotel.

4882
03:24:53,041 --> 03:24:54,270
I was like,
I don't what the fuck I'm doing.

4883
03:24:54,271 --> 03:24:54,991
But I was like,
no,

4884
03:24:54,991 --> 03:24:55,651
it's definitely,
you know,

4885
03:24:55,651 --> 03:24:56,790
what you're doing.
And it unlike,

4886
03:24:56,791 --> 03:24:59,460
it was,
it was a shaky thing.

4887
03:24:59,461 --> 03:25:01,890
And then the next day burt goes,
uh,

4888
03:25:01,950 --> 03:25:03,000
hey,
can I tell you just one thing?

4889
03:25:03,540 --> 03:25:04,440
And I go,
yeah,

4890
03:25:04,441 --> 03:25:05,274
what?
He goes,

4891
03:25:05,310 --> 03:25:07,380
just open on a different joke.

4892
03:25:07,800 --> 03:25:10,520
Just open a different joke.
Do exactly everything else just opened

4893
03:25:10,521 --> 03:25:12,750
on different joke and I go,
okay,

4894
03:25:13,530 --> 03:25:15,210
I go out there,
I do what he said.

4895
03:25:15,211 --> 03:25:18,930
I have to that point,
probably the best that I've ever had.

4896
03:25:19,560 --> 03:25:23,760
And then I go to the manager who's
behind the curtain and the kitchen and I

4897
03:25:23,761 --> 03:25:24,990
go,
well,

4898
03:25:25,020 --> 03:25:26,850
and she goes,
well what did you do your set?

4899
03:25:27,240 --> 03:25:29,520
And I go,
you definitely just heard what happened.

4900
03:25:29,820 --> 03:25:31,620
There was like,
there's 300 people out there.

4901
03:25:31,950 --> 03:25:34,260
And she was like,
did it go well or was it just like last

4902
03:25:34,260 --> 03:25:38,280
night I was like fuck.
And then I went back and the same thing,

4903
03:25:38,281 --> 03:25:41,100
I did the same thing,
the second show just open differently

4904
03:25:41,101 --> 03:25:41,940
and I was like,
ah,

4905
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:43,770
thanks burt.
It was the best advice I ever got.

4906
03:25:43,900 --> 03:25:45,190
Wow.
So through that,

4907
03:25:45,220 --> 03:25:46,810
it's hard if people don't know who you
are.

4908
03:25:46,811 --> 03:25:50,290
If you jump out there and alienating him
with a fucked up joke and then they tell

4909
03:25:50,291 --> 03:25:50,891
me later,
they're like,

4910
03:25:50,891 --> 03:25:52,630
well,
you know that first group there was like

4911
03:25:52,631 --> 03:25:55,960
a 90 Mormons that just wanted to share
baseball.

4912
03:25:56,050 --> 03:25:57,120
Mormon.
Yeah.

4913
03:25:57,820 --> 03:25:59,890
What in the fuck is that?
That's what they used to do.

4914
03:25:59,891 --> 03:26:02,590
They just sell,
sell out the place for church.

4915
03:26:02,591 --> 03:26:04,490
And then you didn't know you were
performing for.

4916
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:08,650
It'd be fine if they get drank.
I like Mormons,

4917
03:26:09,010 --> 03:26:12,400
but I mean at a comedy show those like
crazy.

4918
03:26:12,460 --> 03:26:13,840
I know they do.
Yeah.

4919
03:26:14,140 --> 03:26:16,250
I know that the party with a bunch in
Tibet,

4920
03:26:16,320 --> 03:26:17,740
you have,
they're allowed to,

4921
03:26:18,610 --> 03:26:20,680
pills aren't in their doctrine.
No pills.

4922
03:26:20,800 --> 03:26:23,500
They can do pills do.
You can do monster energy drinks too,

4923
03:26:23,501 --> 03:26:28,501
but they can't drink coffee and load up
on those fucking gigantic know those

4924
03:26:29,650 --> 03:26:32,950
fucking huge cans of red bull that you
look at them and go,

4925
03:26:32,960 --> 03:26:34,900
no,
don't think that

4926
03:26:36,690 --> 03:26:39,370
they have all sorts of polls.
Even Monster Energy.

4927
03:26:39,490 --> 03:26:40,510
Never.
Never there.

4928
03:26:40,520 --> 03:26:41,760
Awesome.
If you want to stay away,

4929
03:26:41,770 --> 03:26:45,850
what do you like on coke?
I'm like,

4930
03:26:45,940 --> 03:26:48,060
I try to blow,
you know like,

4931
03:26:48,340 --> 03:26:51,400
cause I know you partied really much
harder than I've ever partied,

4932
03:26:51,700 --> 03:26:54,280
but you'd see so even Keel when you get
high,

4933
03:26:54,281 --> 03:26:55,960
I go to,
you're not even fucked up fucking

4934
03:26:55,961 --> 03:26:58,660
minute.
You really think that Tommy has partied

4935
03:26:58,661 --> 03:27:00,850
much harder than you've ever partied.
I know that.

4936
03:27:00,930 --> 03:27:01,763
I know.
He knows that.

4937
03:27:02,140 --> 03:27:03,420
Do you think that's true?
100%.

4938
03:27:03,460 --> 03:27:07,480
Making reference to one occasion.
I've never overdosed.

4939
03:27:10,830 --> 03:27:11,663
Yeah,
that's true.

4940
03:27:12,840 --> 03:27:15,960
So he's overdosed.
Overdose on.

4941
03:27:16,200 --> 03:27:17,150
I took a

4942
03:27:17,620 --> 03:27:20,410
wait.
I drank too much ghb and then I,

4943
03:27:20,460 --> 03:27:24,070
I took some ecstasy and then I had like
12,

4944
03:27:24,071 --> 03:27:25,360
13 screwdrivers.

4945
03:27:25,830 --> 03:27:27,450
Oh my God.
Oh Shit.

4946
03:27:27,930 --> 03:27:30,150
I was a freshman in college.
Oh my God.

4947
03:27:30,210 --> 03:27:32,730
I had my shit and control.
That's amazing.

4948
03:27:33,710 --> 03:27:35,340
I haven't been,
um,

4949
03:27:35,820 --> 03:27:37,350
I,
she won't come to the hospital.

4950
03:27:37,770 --> 03:27:40,860
Yeah.
Strapped down tubes down my throat.

4951
03:27:40,910 --> 03:27:42,480
Wow.
Pumping

4952
03:27:42,500 --> 03:27:44,020
was top of the hour.
I'm gonna wrap this up.

4953
03:27:44,310 --> 03:27:46,420
So it was a no,
it was really bad,

4954
03:27:46,421 --> 03:27:47,251
man.
He was really bad.

4955
03:27:47,251 --> 03:27:48,280
Wow.
Yeah.

4956
03:27:48,490 --> 03:27:49,720
You told this before though,
right?

4957
03:27:49,721 --> 03:27:52,540
I told him her show there's a,
it's a Tom Segura overdoses.

4958
03:27:52,570 --> 03:27:53,920
I didn't hear that story.
Yeah,

4959
03:27:53,921 --> 03:27:54,754
it's,
um,

4960
03:27:55,070 --> 03:27:57,700
two w w what happened when they said,
what did you take?

4961
03:27:57,701 --> 03:27:59,260
What did you write down?
They gave me,

4962
03:27:59,530 --> 03:28:00,660
so I'm strapped down.
They,

4963
03:28:00,820 --> 03:28:02,190
what they do when you,
oh,

4964
03:28:02,200 --> 03:28:04,600
D and the catch you at,
at that stage,

4965
03:28:04,660 --> 03:28:08,200
because I passed out is uh,
this starts to swell.

4966
03:28:08,320 --> 03:28:12,190
So they thought about giving me a
tracheotomy and they put tubes down

4967
03:28:12,191 --> 03:28:14,620
there.
They are strapped down so that you don't

4968
03:28:14,621 --> 03:28:18,040
pull the tubes out when you come to.
So when I did like your,

4969
03:28:18,041 --> 03:28:21,340
your hands are really restricted and
then they,

4970
03:28:21,341 --> 03:28:22,990
um,
they're trying to get figured out what's

4971
03:28:22,991 --> 03:28:26,200
going on that see if you can help them
know what's in your system.

4972
03:28:26,590 --> 03:28:29,540
So they gave me,
I'm lefthanded for,

4973
03:28:29,600 --> 03:28:33,520
for writing and they gave him the pen in
my right hand and strapped.

4974
03:28:34,150 --> 03:28:36,160
So they write like,
or they ask me,

4975
03:28:36,161 --> 03:28:38,140
um,
what did you take?

4976
03:28:39,070 --> 03:28:43,240
And I wrote a heroin and they were all
like,

4977
03:28:43,241 --> 03:28:45,610
are you serious?
Just kidding.

4978
03:28:54,630 --> 03:28:56,560
Oh yeah.
And then I had to like write out what

4979
03:28:56,561 --> 03:28:57,281
it,
and then they found,

4980
03:28:57,281 --> 03:28:57,541
you know,
they,

4981
03:28:57,541 --> 03:29:00,190
they give you that.
Why didn't you write out I'm lefthanded

4982
03:29:02,090 --> 03:29:07,090
it seems like
they found out the toxicology report.

4983
03:29:09,650 --> 03:29:11,210
They go,
you have everything in your system.

4984
03:29:11,300 --> 03:29:12,230
Oh my God.
It was like,

4985
03:29:12,231 --> 03:29:13,910
you have,
you have,

4986
03:29:13,911 --> 03:29:15,740
you know,
our bitch with you of uppers.

4987
03:29:15,741 --> 03:29:16,730
You have downers.
You have,

4988
03:29:16,750 --> 03:29:20,090
uh,
you have opiates because the GSP was

4989
03:29:20,091 --> 03:29:22,370
spiked with stuff on my heel.
Light took with spike was style.

4990
03:29:22,380 --> 03:29:23,213
He's like,
that's the thing.

4991
03:29:23,320 --> 03:29:26,780
He goes and you have so much in you,
like it would have killed a lot of

4992
03:29:26,781 --> 03:29:28,850
people.
Like that's amazing that you're alive.

4993
03:29:28,851 --> 03:29:30,110
And I go,
why am I alive?

4994
03:29:30,111 --> 03:29:31,220
And he goes,
honestly,

4995
03:29:31,221 --> 03:29:33,050
cause you're pretty big boy.
Basically.

4996
03:29:33,051 --> 03:29:34,430
He was like,
you're fat and that's what saved your

4997
03:29:34,431 --> 03:29:38,300
life.
That your 250 pounds at the time.

4998
03:29:38,570 --> 03:29:39,410
Wow.
Yeah.

4999
03:29:39,440 --> 03:29:42,350
Did that change the way you partied?
Oh my God.

5000
03:29:42,351 --> 03:29:42,981
Dude.
Yeah,

5001
03:29:42,981 --> 03:29:43,814
of course.

5002
03:29:44,210 --> 03:29:49,040
Yeah.
Even keeled now.

5003
03:29:49,041 --> 03:29:50,810
Like even still like when we went into
New York

5004
03:29:51,240 --> 03:29:53,550
two glasses of wine,
I just am not,

5005
03:29:53,640 --> 03:29:54,780
uh,
it's not from that.

5006
03:29:54,810 --> 03:29:55,790
I just,
um,

5007
03:29:56,050 --> 03:29:58,710
mean I'm not just a,
I'm just not a big or you love jumping

5008
03:29:58,711 --> 03:29:59,700
up and down.
Yeah.

5009
03:29:59,970 --> 03:30:01,740
You love the sprint.
I do.

5010
03:30:01,900 --> 03:30:02,830
He do.
You love the,

5011
03:30:02,831 --> 03:30:03,661
we're doing it.
We're,

5012
03:30:03,661 --> 03:30:06,100
if I could do it best is when,

5013
03:30:07,390 --> 03:30:08,950
when I,
there's too many times where I've been

5014
03:30:08,951 --> 03:30:11,140
at his place and he's like,
just taking it easy.

5015
03:30:11,470 --> 03:30:14,680
And if I go like all you have to do,
it's like you just,

5016
03:30:15,300 --> 03:30:17,890
you plant the seed and you go,
hey,

5017
03:30:17,891 --> 03:30:20,640
you want to have a beer?
Here's what we drink.

5018
03:30:20,890 --> 03:30:24,460
What did you get so excited?
She the level of excite your house.

5019
03:30:24,461 --> 03:30:25,840
You've done it before.
I've done it before,

5020
03:30:25,970 --> 03:30:27,280
but your kid's birthday party,
you were like,

5021
03:30:27,570 --> 03:30:29,020
fuck that beer.
And I was like,

5022
03:30:30,670 --> 03:30:32,900
yeah,
every time he,

5023
03:30:32,901 --> 03:30:35,420
you never go like not right now.
No.

5024
03:30:35,440 --> 03:30:37,480
That's not who I am.
That's not who I am.

5025
03:30:37,481 --> 03:30:40,100
Somebody suggests you're on board.
That's one of the most

5026
03:30:40,380 --> 03:30:41,030
fun things.
You're,

5027
03:30:41,030 --> 03:30:42,230
you're all about it.
Yeah.

5028
03:30:42,440 --> 03:30:44,390
I like it.
I like the rush of it.

5029
03:30:44,870 --> 03:30:48,610
Like imagine when I have you in a
fucking triangle and I'm about,

5030
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:52,340
is this going to happen?
Can I get a Eddie Bravo?

5031
03:30:53,210 --> 03:30:54,110
Well,
what the fuck?

5032
03:30:54,260 --> 03:30:56,300
He knows Eddie Bravo to.
Okay,

5033
03:30:56,360 --> 03:30:57,290
Eddie,
pick your teams.

5034
03:30:57,291 --> 03:30:58,220
You get,
Jack says,

5035
03:30:58,760 --> 03:31:00,710
how does that work?
She had eddie yet.

5036
03:31:00,711 --> 03:31:03,320
What a better team.
You just do it at Ebi or something like

5037
03:31:03,321 --> 03:31:04,041
that.
Yeah,

5038
03:31:04,041 --> 03:31:06,770
we definitely want Dvi.
Looking for my fucking teammate.

5039
03:31:07,100 --> 03:31:10,310
We can definitely do to the Ebi.
Maybe it's not fair.

5040
03:31:10,311 --> 03:31:13,310
Since Eddie knows both of you.
Maybe it's not fair that either one of

5041
03:31:13,311 --> 03:31:15,200
you gets trained by Ed.
I'll take shawn,

5042
03:31:15,220 --> 03:31:16,360
shawn,
Shawn Shock.

5043
03:31:17,100 --> 03:31:18,320
I'll take it.
That's fine.

5044
03:31:19,280 --> 03:31:21,440
I'll take John Shock.
I'll just take some Brazilian.

5045
03:31:21,441 --> 03:31:22,550
Yeah.
Anyone who wants to,

5046
03:31:22,551 --> 03:31:24,210
anyone due to bone.
Yeah.

5047
03:31:24,470 --> 03:31:26,720
One of those dudes from the Gigolo show.
Absolutely.

5048
03:31:26,810 --> 03:31:27,760
And he's like,
I'm Brazilian.

5049
03:31:27,770 --> 03:31:28,690
And be like,
I trust you.

5050
03:31:29,090 --> 03:31:30,540
Let's do this.
Hey,

5051
03:31:30,590 --> 03:31:33,740
I teach you triangle.
But at first I'd be right back.

5052
03:31:33,741 --> 03:31:35,030
I got to slim the Dick.

5053
03:31:37,030 --> 03:31:37,863
Okay.

5054
03:31:38,140 --> 03:31:41,110
This has been a great fucking podcast.
What would you do if you did do a

5055
03:31:41,111 --> 03:31:42,550
Jujitsu match?
What'd you do?

5056
03:31:42,551 --> 03:31:45,010
Like how long you think it would be like
a five minute match?

5057
03:31:45,340 --> 03:31:47,020
10 12 no,
buddy.

5058
03:31:47,080 --> 03:31:47,911
I don't know.
I've never done,

5059
03:31:47,911 --> 03:31:50,890
I've never seen once a long time.
I think we do,

5060
03:31:51,340 --> 03:31:54,220
man.
I mean it would have to be one round and

5061
03:31:54,221 --> 03:31:55,840
see who can,
yeah.

5062
03:31:56,230 --> 03:31:59,830
Yeah.
If you guys really want to do it,

5063
03:32:00,100 --> 03:32:02,830
what bounce around it.
I don't think there's no need to,

5064
03:32:02,831 --> 03:32:03,790
uh,
there's no,

5065
03:32:03,850 --> 03:32:07,480
there's not a need to come up with a,
a definite contest right now.

5066
03:32:07,690 --> 03:32:10,690
You guys are eyeballing each other cause
I'm thinking about cross country skiing

5067
03:32:10,691 --> 03:32:13,180
where they had the rifles to,
we can do that.

5068
03:32:13,540 --> 03:32:14,710
Okay,
I'll look that up.

5069
03:32:14,780 --> 03:32:16,660
My biathlon she had to buy I thought
line shit.

5070
03:32:16,661 --> 03:32:17,494
Like are we going with that?

5071
03:32:17,560 --> 03:32:19,360
Something called the total archery
challenge,

5072
03:32:19,420 --> 03:32:21,460
which like you run around the woods and
hit targets.

5073
03:32:21,710 --> 03:32:24,400
Oh,
I mean I'll kill that.

5074
03:32:24,740 --> 03:32:25,481
Listen,
just,

5075
03:32:25,481 --> 03:32:27,340
we could,
you guys could do a bunch of shit.

5076
03:32:27,870 --> 03:32:29,590
It really should be a show though.
Yeah.

5077
03:32:29,680 --> 03:32:32,440
We should definitely do it.
If you keep it along the path that it's

5078
03:32:32,441 --> 03:32:36,580
been on for this sort of competition,
this is like a super beneficial

5079
03:32:36,581 --> 03:32:38,650
competition for both of you guys.
Yeah.

5080
03:32:39,310 --> 03:32:43,060
He lost and insane amount of weight.
You really did it.

5081
03:32:43,300 --> 03:32:45,370
Seriously.
That's the one that really like freaked

5082
03:32:45,371 --> 03:32:45,630
out.
My,

5083
03:32:45,630 --> 03:32:48,400
my,
my sisters have never watched this

5084
03:32:48,401 --> 03:32:50,040
podcast.
They've heard it before that ever

5085
03:32:50,080 --> 03:32:52,300
watched it.
They watched it with my wife and my

5086
03:32:52,301 --> 03:32:55,330
daughters yesterday and I came home.
They were like,

5087
03:32:55,780 --> 03:32:57,850
Tommy's lost a lot of weight.
I was like,

5088
03:32:57,980 --> 03:33:00,220
Hey,
your dad has two and they're like,

5089
03:33:00,221 --> 03:33:01,830
I know what Tommy has lost a lot of
weight,

5090
03:33:01,840 --> 03:33:03,640
but they see your daily,
they see me daily,

5091
03:33:03,641 --> 03:33:05,260
but they were like,
Tommy is also a lot of weight.

5092
03:33:05,470 --> 03:33:07,480
That is a problem though.
When people are around you all the time,

5093
03:33:07,481 --> 03:33:10,660
they get used to a certain look and even
if it shifts radically over the course

5094
03:33:10,661 --> 03:33:12,460
of six months,
you don't notice it.

5095
03:33:12,490 --> 03:33:16,060
This one's going to take a while for the
family with the failed the mustache.

5096
03:33:17,810 --> 03:33:19,690
I'm going to trim it up a tad bit before
I go home,

5097
03:33:19,840 --> 03:33:24,070
but yes,
I think the bottom part is a little tad

5098
03:33:24,071 --> 03:33:27,820
bit uneven and it looks good.
Agree to disagree.

5099
03:33:27,850 --> 03:33:30,850
If you want to trim it up,
that's all fine and dandy to trim it up

5100
03:33:30,851 --> 03:33:32,470
a tad bit.
I think the most I should stay and I'm

5101
03:33:32,471 --> 03:33:34,570
very happy you made that decision.
Yeah,

5102
03:33:34,571 --> 03:33:37,000
that's good.
I think the mustache freak the fuck out.

5103
03:33:37,050 --> 03:33:38,700
They're going to laugh.
They're going to be fine.

5104
03:33:38,701 --> 03:33:41,130
We're happy to see you.
They're going to be like this eating

5105
03:33:41,131 --> 03:33:42,090
dinner when we just odd.

5106
03:33:42,150 --> 03:33:43,810
I have a business meeting.
Yeah.

5107
03:33:43,950 --> 03:33:45,180
We're going to be laid for that for
sure.

5108
03:33:45,181 --> 03:33:45,661
Nope.
Nope,

5109
03:33:45,661 --> 03:33:46,261
nope.
I'm good.

5110
03:33:46,261 --> 03:33:50,150
I'm good cushion.
That cushion is very important.

5111
03:33:50,151 --> 03:33:51,420
But Jamie,
do we have to leave?

5112
03:33:51,660 --> 03:33:53,370
Cause Tom's moving around like he has to
leave,

5113
03:33:53,371 --> 03:33:55,650
but I don't think he has to know.
I don't have to leave.

5114
03:33:55,860 --> 03:33:57,030
I don't have to leave either.
Tommy,

5115
03:33:57,570 --> 03:33:59,850
this is one of the things you get off a
waffle state.

5116
03:34:00,780 --> 03:34:03,630
No one's your waffle date.
I don't have the time.

5117
03:34:03,990 --> 03:34:05,970
There's no time.
No time decision.

5118
03:34:06,270 --> 03:34:07,560
We're going to go.
It's a good move.

5119
03:34:07,640 --> 03:34:11,010
Yeah.
Waffles are like pure enjoyment.

5120
03:34:11,240 --> 03:34:15,360
There's no illusion of nutrition,
especially when the crispy on the

5121
03:34:15,361 --> 03:34:17,760
outside and you could just tell us all
into something.

5122
03:34:18,550 --> 03:34:20,620
I just,
I go fucking whole hog.

5123
03:34:20,621 --> 03:34:23,220
Really butter.
I just kill that thing with butter to

5124
03:34:23,260 --> 03:34:24,800
chapter.
The souffle I talked about.

5125
03:34:25,240 --> 03:34:26,970
Same thing.
You're just making a decision to

5126
03:34:26,971 --> 03:34:27,641
indulge.
Yeah.

5127
03:34:27,641 --> 03:34:29,370
Just hardy.
Go deep.

5128
03:34:29,760 --> 03:34:31,980
Ever had a caviar.
Yeah.

5129
03:34:33,090 --> 03:34:34,480
Uh,
uh,

5130
03:34:34,860 --> 03:34:39,120
Rod Stewart Daughter's party.
My first weekend I'll name drop out and

5131
03:34:39,121 --> 03:34:42,600
I had caviar so much I couldn't,
I couldn't take it away.

5132
03:34:42,650 --> 03:34:44,490
I don't number five,
they took it away.

5133
03:34:45,330 --> 03:34:47,790
They took the caviar away from you if
you're eating too much.

5134
03:34:47,791 --> 03:34:49,560
Eating so much.
Cause I'd never had it before.

5135
03:34:50,190 --> 03:34:53,880
They actually moved to the whole plate
of all the seafood and pulled it out of

5136
03:34:53,881 --> 03:34:55,500
the table.
Oh my God.

5137
03:34:55,620 --> 03:34:57,000
Nicole [inaudible],
Nicole Richie.

5138
03:34:57,001 --> 03:34:58,260
What's her name?
How drunk were you?

5139
03:34:58,261 --> 03:34:59,580
Kimberly Stewart.
Sober.

5140
03:34:59,660 --> 03:35:01,100
Still sober.
I just never had caviar.

5141
03:35:01,230 --> 03:35:04,620
So you were going at it so hard.
They decided this guy's going to eat it

5142
03:35:04,621 --> 03:35:08,160
all and it's selfish.
Gluttonous rampage of caviar

5143
03:35:08,161 --> 03:35:09,840
consumption.
My Buddy Eddie was like,

5144
03:35:09,841 --> 03:35:11,160
if you're at caviar before,
and I was like,

5145
03:35:11,161 --> 03:35:11,791
no.
And he's like,

5146
03:35:11,791 --> 03:35:12,624
dude,
you should try it.

5147
03:35:13,000 --> 03:35:14,700
So I tried it with like a cracker.

5148
03:35:17,010 --> 03:35:17,731
I was like,
dude,

5149
03:35:17,731 --> 03:35:19,890
you should try it.
So I'm in hall.

5150
03:35:20,770 --> 03:35:23,160
I was dipping into it like a guacamole.
I was

5151
03:35:25,230 --> 03:35:28,050
murdering it and they came out and
remove the whole plate.

5152
03:35:28,080 --> 03:35:30,990
It was like a like literally as you're
scooping or three people,

5153
03:35:31,000 --> 03:35:33,120
three foot plate.
They were moved it back to the kitchen

5154
03:35:33,121 --> 03:35:34,560
and I was like,
where did that go?

5155
03:35:35,560 --> 03:35:38,340
Isn't that funny?
Like they'll put food out,

5156
03:35:38,341 --> 03:35:42,570
but only if you eat a certain amount of,
they see one person's enjoying it too

5157
03:35:42,571 --> 03:35:44,430
much.
They will move in.

5158
03:35:44,460 --> 03:35:46,110
We passed me another piece of Pepperoni
please.

5159
03:35:46,290 --> 03:35:46,861
Yeah.
This whole,

5160
03:35:46,861 --> 03:35:48,420
this one's,
this one's done.

5161
03:35:48,510 --> 03:35:49,343
Oh,
for real.

5162
03:35:50,970 --> 03:35:53,280
What was this event that you were out?
This is the one with mushrooms.

5163
03:35:53,281 --> 03:35:55,740
Do you want to know more chatham quote
that I party?

5164
03:35:56,040 --> 03:35:57,320
What was the,
um,

5165
03:35:58,050 --> 03:36:00,390
I party.
What was the event that you were at?

5166
03:36:01,390 --> 03:36:02,640
A,
uh,

5167
03:36:02,690 --> 03:36:04,350
I might,
I was at ICM at the time.

5168
03:36:04,950 --> 03:36:06,680
Dad was at ICM.
Malaria.

5169
03:36:06,690 --> 03:36:09,060
So they were trying to preserve the
food.

5170
03:36:09,090 --> 03:36:11,000
They tried to get me fatter.
We enter new competence.

5171
03:36:11,001 --> 03:36:12,510
I'm terrible sliced.
You son,

5172
03:36:12,990 --> 03:36:15,090
he gave you two slices and made a
sandwich

5173
03:36:16,710 --> 03:36:17,543
pizza though,
right?

5174
03:36:19,850 --> 03:36:22,800
Mm hmm dude.
Take that to the meeting.

5175
03:36:22,890 --> 03:36:24,990
Take the double pizza into the meeting.
Yeah.

5176
03:36:25,020 --> 03:36:26,460
No,
just take the thought of the double

5177
03:36:26,461 --> 03:36:28,110
pizza.
The fact that you,

5178
03:36:28,111 --> 03:36:30,660
uh,
you came in silver in the weight loss

5179
03:36:30,661 --> 03:36:32,670
challenge.
I was gold and silver.

5180
03:36:32,900 --> 03:36:34,090
It's not bad.
It's not bad.

5181
03:36:35,470 --> 03:36:36,580
Yeah.
No big deal,

5182
03:36:36,581 --> 03:36:40,510
man.
Powerful political contest between you

5183
03:36:40,511 --> 03:36:42,820
two guys,
like every few months.

5184
03:36:43,030 --> 03:36:46,780
I think that's the sort of still fun.
It's still fun.

5185
03:36:47,070 --> 03:36:49,780
Yeah.
Figure out a perfectly ideas surf

5186
03:36:49,781 --> 03:36:52,240
competition.
Like I can't stop at all.

5187
03:36:52,330 --> 03:36:54,880
I used to surf when I was kid,
but now I feel like I can,

5188
03:36:54,881 --> 03:36:56,510
cause I skidded yesterday.
I've told it.

5189
03:36:56,590 --> 03:36:59,260
Best case scenario,
someone stands for three seconds and

5190
03:36:59,261 --> 03:37:02,650
then gets a concussion.
Best case scenario.

5191
03:37:04,630 --> 03:37:06,720
Fuck it.
Surfing man.

5192
03:37:08,200 --> 03:37:12,460
Surfing is incredible.
But I dunno if you guys really want to

5193
03:37:12,461 --> 03:37:14,860
get into that competition.
How do you even judge that?

5194
03:37:15,460 --> 03:37:18,040
How do you judge it?
Amount of time that you're standing up?

5195
03:37:18,041 --> 03:37:20,110
How do you judge it coach later?
No,

5196
03:37:20,470 --> 03:37:21,281
Kelly Slater.
Judge.

5197
03:37:21,281 --> 03:37:24,250
It wouldn't get them on the couch.
He would probably judge it.

5198
03:37:24,740 --> 03:37:26,420
Or are you shopping?
That'd be fun.

5199
03:37:26,630 --> 03:37:28,000
Yeah.
We've talked about it a few times.

5200
03:37:28,210 --> 03:37:29,043
What's up dog?
He,

5201
03:37:29,230 --> 03:37:30,030
he,
he uh,

5202
03:37:30,030 --> 03:37:32,380
texted me some ridiculous videos.
Sebastian inlet

5203
03:37:34,060 --> 03:37:35,290
things.
No,

5204
03:37:35,291 --> 03:37:37,810
I mean he would the,
I never even saw him,

5205
03:37:37,811 --> 03:37:40,510
but it was apparently a bunch of good
surfers would do the Sebastian inlet,

5206
03:37:40,511 --> 03:37:42,910
which is not far mauser whole.
Yeah,

5207
03:37:43,130 --> 03:37:43,670
no,
that's true.

5208
03:37:43,670 --> 03:37:45,100
But especially with like,
yeah,

5209
03:37:45,101 --> 03:37:50,101
that's a totally different type of human
to get on a board and ride it on top of

5210
03:37:50,261 --> 03:37:52,780
the ocean.
It looks so fucking cool when you see

5211
03:37:52,781 --> 03:37:55,270
the high,
the high level guys do it and they have

5212
03:37:55,271 --> 03:37:59,080
the Gopros on.
Have you seen his new Surf Pool?

5213
03:37:59,560 --> 03:38:00,840
No,
I too.

5214
03:38:00,850 --> 03:38:04,330
I put her on my facebook the other day.
It's called a Oh shit.

5215
03:38:04,331 --> 03:38:05,860
We put it up on here one time.
Did you?

5216
03:38:05,890 --> 03:38:08,500
Is it the one with the perfect glassy
lake?

5217
03:38:08,501 --> 03:38:09,880
It's like the perfect way.
Oh,

5218
03:38:10,030 --> 03:38:11,890
it's so beautiful.
Can you play it real quick?

5219
03:38:11,920 --> 03:38:13,360
It's the most beautiful thing you've
ever seen.

5220
03:38:13,900 --> 03:38:16,260
That strong word telling you.
Well,

5221
03:38:16,261 --> 03:38:18,960
I dunno,
they just go into the detail right here.

5222
03:38:19,020 --> 03:38:23,860
The water champ has down five bottles of
water and to coconut water.

5223
03:38:23,861 --> 03:38:25,960
How deep am I on this?
This is insane.

5224
03:38:26,320 --> 03:38:28,150
Can I actually get another one?
Yeah.

5225
03:38:28,170 --> 03:38:29,003
Yeah.
Really?

5226
03:38:29,500 --> 03:38:31,480
Oh,
you have a child and I haven't peed.

5227
03:38:31,900 --> 03:38:35,860
This is amazing.
The water champions just breaking into

5228
03:38:35,861 --> 03:38:38,800
his bottle of water.
Look at this.

5229
03:38:38,801 --> 03:38:42,110
Tell me this doesn't reek gorgeous to
you.

5230
03:38:42,550 --> 03:38:44,080
Yeah,
just hold on.

5231
03:38:44,081 --> 03:38:46,810
Hold on.
It's an amazing fucking ability that

5232
03:38:46,811 --> 03:38:49,240
these people have riding these girls
like this.

5233
03:38:49,510 --> 03:38:51,420
Let's look at this.
This is incredible art,

5234
03:38:52,940 --> 03:38:54,620
Tommy.
I'm having Deja Vu right now.

5235
03:38:55,690 --> 03:38:57,090
Yeah,
the rail,

5236
03:38:57,091 --> 03:38:57,431
right?
Well,

5237
03:38:57,431 --> 03:38:59,470
he built that pool.
That's his pool.

5238
03:38:59,500 --> 03:39:00,730
That's a pool.
It's not the ocean.

5239
03:39:00,760 --> 03:39:01,480
Oh,
really?

5240
03:39:01,480 --> 03:39:03,130
Yeah.
That's what's amazing about this.

5241
03:39:03,280 --> 03:39:05,530
Oh my God.
So you could learn how to surf on this.

5242
03:39:05,560 --> 03:39:06,670
Yes.
Oh my God.

5243
03:39:06,671 --> 03:39:07,750
No sharks.
Look at her.

5244
03:39:08,050 --> 03:39:10,300
That's a pro surfer going.
Thank you God.

5245
03:39:11,050 --> 03:39:12,700
How do you know what she's saying?
What did I knew of her?

5246
03:39:12,701 --> 03:39:15,130
She's just laying down Lakey Peterson.
I've interviewed her.

5247
03:39:15,670 --> 03:39:16,503
You have?
Yeah,

5248
03:39:16,900 --> 03:39:19,360
I know.
All these people power from her crush or

5249
03:39:22,280 --> 03:39:24,430
pool.
100% it's a pool.

5250
03:39:24,580 --> 03:39:25,720
Oh my God.
Where is it?

5251
03:39:25,810 --> 03:39:27,580
It's I,
they won't tell you because they're

5252
03:39:27,581 --> 03:39:28,790
trying to sell it.
The,

5253
03:39:28,960 --> 03:39:29,793
the,
the,

5254
03:39:30,070 --> 03:39:31,810
you can see the hints of the posts in
the corner,

5255
03:39:31,811 --> 03:39:32,740
man.
Oh,

5256
03:39:32,741 --> 03:39:34,010
that is that what that is in the back?

5257
03:39:34,400 --> 03:39:35,450
Yeah.
And there's sides on it.

5258
03:39:35,451 --> 03:39:37,700
You can see the sides.
That's crazy.

5259
03:39:37,701 --> 03:39:39,660
That's pool.
That pool is this stuff,

5260
03:39:39,661 --> 03:39:40,431
man.
It's massive.

5261
03:39:40,431 --> 03:39:42,890
I want to say,
where do you do like a manmade lake?

5262
03:39:42,891 --> 03:39:43,820
It's not really,
I wouldn't call it,

5263
03:39:43,821 --> 03:39:47,090
where is it?
I think somewhere in Malaysia and stuff

5264
03:39:47,160 --> 03:39:49,790
like the big,
like a wave generator pull like a

5265
03:39:49,791 --> 03:39:51,650
waterpark.
They just have the biggest,

5266
03:39:51,740 --> 03:39:53,450
best version of that.
Wow.

5267
03:39:53,840 --> 03:39:55,250
This is crazy.
And this is,

5268
03:39:55,251 --> 03:39:56,990
you said Malaysia?
I don't know.

5269
03:39:57,110 --> 03:39:59,140
They don't tell you.
I think they also are going to make

5270
03:39:59,210 --> 03:40:00,290
slices.
They can sell them wherever.

5271
03:40:01,060 --> 03:40:05,570
They could pick a ticket somewhere.
Ah.

5272
03:40:06,310 --> 03:40:08,450
All right boys.
Um,

5273
03:40:08,540 --> 03:40:10,040
should we wrap this up?
Hey for real.

5274
03:40:10,041 --> 03:40:12,320
Thank you for hosting it though.
My pleasure,

5275
03:40:12,321 --> 03:40:13,490
man.
My pleasure.

5276
03:40:14,270 --> 03:40:17,650
I'm honored for real and the oil shrunk
from my mouse will hold on.

5277
03:40:17,660 --> 03:40:18,260
I'm sorry.
Yeah,

5278
03:40:18,260 --> 03:40:20,300
I mean it really was fun.
I'm glad that you,

5279
03:40:20,380 --> 03:40:23,350
when you were like,
I'm gonna do the MC the way it was.

5280
03:40:23,440 --> 03:40:24,640
It was really a fun time,
man.

5281
03:40:24,910 --> 03:40:28,060
Oh Man.
For me it's even more awesome.

5282
03:40:28,120 --> 03:40:29,560
You know,
I love both of you guys.

5283
03:40:29,561 --> 03:40:32,350
You're both hilarious and to have you
come in and do this in here,

5284
03:40:32,770 --> 03:40:35,500
it's fun.
And I really mean what I said that what

5285
03:40:35,501 --> 03:40:38,050
you guys did,
whenever someone does something like

5286
03:40:38,051 --> 03:40:41,890
that where they just decide to make
contest and the the results,

5287
03:40:41,891 --> 03:40:44,230
that contest is,
you could radically improve your life

5288
03:40:44,470 --> 03:40:46,750
over a short period of time.
Radically improve your health.

5289
03:40:47,260 --> 03:40:49,150
I mean,
I can't imagine what it would be like to

5290
03:40:49,151 --> 03:40:52,690
walk around with 57 less pounds.
I mean,

5291
03:40:52,960 --> 03:40:54,200
it's incredible.
What,

5292
03:40:54,410 --> 03:40:55,900
how much did you lose total?
Was it,

5293
03:40:55,930 --> 03:41:00,930
I guess 51 51 51 pounds removed from
your body is an incredible

5294
03:41:02,831 --> 03:41:05,350
accomplishment.
I like 11 pounds of water at this point.

5295
03:41:05,440 --> 03:41:06,430
Yeah,
but it doesn't matter.

5296
03:41:06,431 --> 03:41:09,640
It's still incredible.
Even if it's only 40 like actual solid

5297
03:41:10,720 --> 03:41:11,770
fat weight.
Yeah,

5298
03:41:12,040 --> 03:41:13,760
it's amazing.
He's amazing from man.

5299
03:41:13,960 --> 03:41:15,700
You do look different.
Thanks Ben.

5300
03:41:15,730 --> 03:41:17,930
And you show a little bit different too
different,

5301
03:41:18,490 --> 03:41:19,840
man,
everybody can do this.

5302
03:41:19,841 --> 03:41:22,030
You know?
And there's a lot of reasons why people

5303
03:41:22,031 --> 03:41:25,570
make excuses.
You'll feel you'll feel so much better.

5304
03:41:25,900 --> 03:41:26,850
You really will.
Yeah.

5305
03:41:26,860 --> 03:41:29,770
Instead of coming up with reasons why
you can't do it.

5306
03:41:29,800 --> 03:41:33,190
Try to figure out a way that you can,
and it might not be today and it might

5307
03:41:33,191 --> 03:41:36,040
not be tomorrow,
but there's gotta be a way to improve

5308
03:41:36,041 --> 03:41:39,070
things and to always concentrate on the
reasons why he can't.

5309
03:41:39,400 --> 03:41:42,370
You've got to keep winding up and
patterns and sometimes like a little

5310
03:41:42,371 --> 03:41:46,720
competition like you guys did in fun and
fairness and friendship.

5311
03:41:46,780 --> 03:41:48,520
It,
it's a good thing because it shows

5312
03:41:48,521 --> 03:41:50,710
people that everybody want out of that.
You know,

5313
03:41:50,740 --> 03:41:54,820
