1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,570
Trey,

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,720
my daddy Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:04,500
Well,

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,640
at all tribes,

5
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:06,480
the nature of tribes,

6
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:09,300
you tell something that makes your
tribe look like the good guys.

7
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,720
Right?

8
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:09,991
Right.

9
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:11,250
So each tribe has,

10
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:11,581
that's,

11
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:13,020
that's the conservative story.

12
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:17,310
And then the liberal story is like
we're fighting racism and sexism.

13
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,360
Did you see the Golden Globes?

14
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,591
Uh,

15
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:19,560
I did see the Golden,

16
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,580
did you see the Meryl Streep's?

17
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:22,280
We did see the Meryl Streep's speech.

18
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,250
God bless her.

19
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,480
God bless marrow.

20
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:25,860
What'd she was talking about?

21
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:27,630
Mixed martial arts people got so mad.

22
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,011
And I was like,

23
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:32,790
of course she doesn't watch cage fighter
when she's talking out of her ass for

24
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,121
sure.

25
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:33,500
But she,

26
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,300
you know to say that some
people aren't artists,

27
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:37,440
martial artists aren't artists.

28
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,680
Well that's completely
open to interpretation.

29
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,040
Like what do you think is beautiful?

30
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,090
You think that fucking stupid movie
when you played that Rockstar,

31
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,860
what was that one that
nobody went to see him?

32
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,170
Ricky get your gun or
whatever the fuck that is.

33
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,520
Listen that wasn't art.

34
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,960
An art and Anderson Silva Front kick
to the face is a thousand times more

35
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:55,860
beautiful than that piece.

36
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,420
Shit movie put out lady.

37
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,430
I know.

38
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,870
I'm sure she's a very nice person.

39
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:02,400
She probably thinks that she's,

40
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,530
she's standing up for what's right.

41
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,970
Get ready for Ricky.

42
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,680
Ricky Flash.

43
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,850
Get the fuck out of here.

44
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,430
Three people saw that movie
and they're all related to her.

45
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,740
Nobody saw that movie.

46
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,770
Did you see that movie
even heard of what the,

47
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,440
it was like,

48
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,280
what are they doing?

49
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,350
She's an 80 year old lady.

50
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:19,340
She's going to be a rockstar.

51
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,610
Ricky's coming back and,

52
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,220
but it's also like such
weird casting for her too.

53
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:26,490
Cause like she does like these
emotionally difficult like Sophie's choice

54
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:26,941
movies.

55
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:29,640
And then she's like trying to
do like a poppy rock star movie.

56
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,020
Well she was interested in it.

57
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:31,261
You know,

58
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:33,240
she's an amazing actress.

59
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,790
She's an amazing artist in her realm.

60
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,350
And I just think it's the,

61
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:37,920
you could,

62
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,920
you could sort of say that without
disparaging what other people enjoy and

63
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:46,920
including disparaging what a lot
of women in joy and foreigners.

64
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,250
One of the things you were saying is that
Hollywood is crawling with foreigners.

65
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,240
If you take them out,

66
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:54,540
all you have left is MMA
and football and MMA.

67
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,010
Mixed martial arts is not the arts.

68
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,420
But you wouldn't,

69
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,020
that's not true because like 80% of
the fighters in the UFC or from other

70
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:01,854
countries,

71
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,050
they're from Ireland.

72
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:04,260
Like Conor Mcgregor,

73
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:05,550
they're from Brazil,

74
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:06,450
like Amanda Nunez.

75
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:07,840
I mean this is the good,

76
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:11,100
incredibly diverse lineup of
people from all over the world.

77
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,350
So for her to say that as like so silly,

78
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:13,961
but I,

79
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:17,310
I can understand saying that you don't
think it's an art by your interpretation.

80
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,810
I understand that.

81
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,240
But the larger point is
that humans are silly.

82
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,230
Humans in general are silly
and we're not individually.

83
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,064
That's smart.

84
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,690
I think performance arts,

85
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,280
like as far as dance,

86
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,530
I mean their dance is clearly an art,

87
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:31,741
right?

88
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:33,240
If you watch Mikhail Baryshnikov,

89
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:34,290
that's clearly art.

90
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,520
And I think in many ways
competition in performance,

91
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,980
like gymnastics is also an art.

92
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,210
We don't think of it as an art.

93
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:43,200
We think of it as a sport.

94
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,030
But when you look at the ability
to execute these spectacular moves,

95
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:48,360
yeah,

96
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,880
maybe that doing it to a concerto,

97
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,680
but it's still art.

98
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,050
You know,

99
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,430
like you,

100
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,170
you see some amazing gymnast fly
through the air and nail a landing.

101
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,010
It's beautiful.

102
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,801
It's glorious.

103
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:01,720
Well that's art in competition,

104
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,120
but it's not one on one competition.

105
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:08,980
Now art in one on one competition is
Edson Barboza wheel kicking Terry Edem.

106
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,170
I know it doesn't look
like art to some people,

107
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,340
but to me it does well and it's a
technically extremely difficult move.

108
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,220
It's a lot of time to
practice and get good at.

109
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,360
So it's just the fact that when he
does his beautiful pair of flat,

110
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,950
it just lands in someone's face.

111
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,191
Well,

112
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:28,630
someone has to suffer and because someone
has to suffer and perhaps sometimes

113
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:31,210
both people have to suffer in the in,

114
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:31,961
in terms of,

115
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,794
uh,

116
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,880
a very brutal fight.

117
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,210
Right.

118
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,751
But if you look at,

119
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:38,680
like Amanda Nunez is knock out of Ronda
Rousey's if you're an Amanda Nunez Fan,

120
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:40,300
that is a beautiful work of art.

121
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:40,630
Yeah.

122
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,720
Cause she didn't get any
promotion for that fight.

123
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,710
She was looked at like cannon fodder
to go in there and fight rousy.

124
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:50,680
A lot of people were predicting a first
round victory and she went out there and

125
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:52,300
fucked her up in 48 seconds.

126
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,820
Art Tool to some people,

127
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,560
it might not be to her,

128
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:57,394
but

129
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,910
[inaudible].
