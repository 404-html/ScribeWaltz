1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,560
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,090
It looks like you'd
just have a huge marble.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,010
I've never understood the pipe white
market I've probably had in my life,

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,100
maybe 10 paperweights.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,650
I don't think of that dead.

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,640
I've never had a bit where I'm like,

7
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:16,410
my paper has been so out of control.

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,490
I just,

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,091
I just shut.

10
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:18,924
We knows.

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,711
You know what I mean?

12
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:20,850
Like I'm a window shutter.

13
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:24,930
I see that as an easier fix than
just paper blowing everywhere or,

14
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,060
and plus there's so many outside,

15
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:27,930
like in your yard,

16
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:30,190
if you really needed
something to weight it down.

17
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,110
A book is one.

18
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,690
Anything's one.

19
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,860
Like these people who,

20
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,310
who've made us think that it's an
actual invention that we're like,

21
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,870
we'll build an actual glass object
with a spindly thing in the middle.

22
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,720
Yeah,

23
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,980
and then everybody else was like,

24
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,731
Oh shit,

25
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:48,620
we got to get involved with that market.

26
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:49,340
Right.

27
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,971
God Damn,

28
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:51,340
we've got to jump on that globe.

29
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:51,830
Wonder,

30
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,530
I wonder if it's patented or patent.

31
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,960
It could be patented,

32
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,820
painted.

33
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,920
Is that how you would say thing?

34
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,550
That's how I would say it,

35
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:03,110
but I still think that's
the wrong way to say it.

36
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:03,944
In my accent.

37
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,330
But you just take it with
me speaking like a Todd.

38
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:09,260
I don't think it was,

39
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,720
I don't think it was anything
to do with being Australian.

40
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,980
It's so bizarre how similar
Australians are two Americans,

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,510
even though like,

42
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:17,810
you know,

43
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,490
you guys have a different accent,

44
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,761
you know,

45
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:20,780
the accents a little,

46
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,760
a little odd for us,

47
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,140
you know,

48
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,150
I think we're seeing more similar to
the British person you are as well.

49
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,071
But I mean it's,

50
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:28,590
it's amazing how you go there.

51
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,370
What I'm going to,

52
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,160
by the way,

53
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,590
uh,

54
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:30,951
the way,

55
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:31,191
I mean,

56
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,440
and it's like you just could fit right in.

57
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,780
The accent melts after a day,

58
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,310
and that's just what people sound like.

59
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,900
And it seems like you're in America.

60
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:39,481
Well,

61
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:42,810
I don't notice the American
accent now on anybody at all.

62
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,410
It's only when I have to do an audition
and they make me do the American accent

63
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:48,030
that I get a bit shitty
with the whole thing.

64
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,541
Oh,

65
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,250
do they do that?

66
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,030
They would make you change your voice.

67
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,401
Yeah.

68
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:53,000
And like I fucked that one audition.

69
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,210
I got a couple of callbacks
and then I said the word,

70
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,044
uh,

71
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,741
I said,

72
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:56,981
I said,

73
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:58,450
I went to the zoo and I saw a zebra.

74
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,990
I still said Zebra in,

75
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,210
and he just said that I still
set it in an American accent,

76
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,670
but with British phrasing
and they freak the fuck out.

77
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:08,140
I need to hear more of
this American voice.

78
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:09,010
That was a creepy voice,

79
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,240
dude.

80
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,521
Why?

81
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:10,630
Why is that so creepy?

82
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,090
What else?

83
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,923
What are we going to do,

84
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,091
dude,

85
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:17,260
that is creepy as fuck you
talking with an American voice.

86
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,790
That is crazy.

87
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,501
Like I said,

88
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:20,334
it w I'm sort of,

89
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,660
I wouldn't say synonymous with Vice.

90
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:24,180
I can't a lot on stage and
people always want me to say,

91
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:28,510
can't like when they have photos
and it talking about in my accent,

92
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:29,180
if I say can't,

93
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,550
it's,

94
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,660
it sounds great,

95
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,450
but even when I state can't,

96
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,480
as an American,

97
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,050
I've go,

98
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,883
Ooh,

99
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,810
well that's a bit harsh dude.

100
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,520
You sound like a totally different human
when you look at that fucking cut over

101
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:41,910
there.

102
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,340
Come on.

103
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,680
What was,

104
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,850
you never think that's Jim Jefferies?

105
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:45,511
There's no way.

106
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,201
I would think that's,

107
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:46,350
yeah,

108
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:46,591
I know,

109
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:47,910
but that's the thing is called me up.

110
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:49,470
That would freak me the fuck out.

111
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,041
I'm tell you right now,

112
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,450
don't do that just
because of the sound guy.

113
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:54,241
Is that the no,

114
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,074
it doesn't sound,

115
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,280
it sounds,

116
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,540
just want to speak to you very quickly.

117
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,100
We have a few problems here right now.

118
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,600
It sounds vaguely fucked up.

119
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:04,780
Like [inaudible] it doesn't sound right.

120
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,940
It sounds really good though.

121
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,970
It's so close to like a real person.

122
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,650
Not like there's something
affected about doing an accent.

123
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:14,920
Joe,

124
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,753
I want to hear you in and,

125
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,520
and do it.

126
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,580
He kind of make a deal like a fighter.

127
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,340
I'm still actually,

128
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,840
it wasn't bad but I like
putting on a second.

129
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,460
I would say we don't say shit.

130
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:28,980
We don't,

131
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,420
we don't.

132
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,490
I do more English like,

133
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,830
well mine's 50 50 cause I
lived in England for 10 years,

134
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:34,480
but we don't say the word.

135
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,800
We don't say the word shrimp.

136
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,460
No,

137
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,150
this is like Americans go prawns,

138
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:38,411
shrimp.

139
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:39,550
We call them prawns.

140
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,443
Right.

141
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,850
Paul Hogan does that fucking
commercial where he goes,

142
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:43,181
all right,

143
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,220
we'll throw another shrimp on
the Barbie for you like that.

144
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:46,030
Right.

145
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,090
And now that's like synonymous with
Australians strains when that's not even a

146
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:49,331
word.

147
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,130
We say I appeal,

148
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,820
yell that out at American gigs,

149
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,470
but when I'm on stage,

150
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:54,640
go do the shrimp thing.

151
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:54,881
I'm like,

152
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,714
what the fuck off?

153
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,980
Isn't it weird how many like crazy
personalities have come out of Australia?

154
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,450
Like the crocodile hunter?

155
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,270
All Hogan Crocodile Dundee?

156
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:04,600
Yeah.

157
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,170
Oh yeah.

158
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:05,891
He was out.

159
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:06,700
Diana.

160
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,533
Yeah,

161
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,180
crocodile and I go to l.

162
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,361
Dot.

163
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:11,194
He was here.

164
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,510
He lives around here somewhere.

165
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,680
Does it kangaroo Jack.

166
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,370
They only did a couple of those crocodile
dundees though and then there were

167
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:18,671
done.

168
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,070
I would have thought that could have
been like some Indiana Jones type shit.

169
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:21,560
I know they do.

170
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,393
The third,

171
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,620
the third ones are Pauling.

172
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,880
The third one's always
strive to Davey Day.

173
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:28,714
Yeah.

174
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,170
And it's,

175
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,130
and it's like case was,

176
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:31,720
the whole idea was a crocodile.

177
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:36,040
Dundee went from Australia in the
outback of Australia to New York and it's

178
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,251
like,

179
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,330
what the fuck's he going to do?

180
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:39,610
This is such a different place
so you can survive out there,

181
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,570
but he can't survive here.

182
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,100
So that happened for the first two films.

183
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,180
Then for the third film,

184
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:46,840
you think let's send him to another
country like Britain or somewhere else.

185
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,830
That's different.

186
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,540
It's Crocodile Dundee.

187
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,673
Nla.

188
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,790
Now the thing is,

189
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,970
he's been living since the last
crocodile benefit Dundee film.

190
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:57,310
He's been living in New
York for over a decade.

191
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,670
And then he gets to La and he
doesn't know what's going on.

192
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,070
Why it gets too alarming for him.

193
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:05,530
Like what are all these
people wearing sunglasses for?

194
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:06,460
This is weird,

195
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,140
cheesy.

196
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,860
These women's breasts are too big.

197
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,580
Like it's,

198
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,870
it's not a great film.

199
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,630
And in the end he becomes
an animal trainer,

200
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,470
uh,

201
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,490
for the movies.

202
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,870
Any foils,

203
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:17,704
a robbery.

204
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,380
An animal.

205
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,650
Actually now I look back at it.

206
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,710
It's a great film.

207
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,450
I,

208
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,220
you ready to record recording?

209
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,601
Oh,

210
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:56,434
it is already.

211
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,520
What the fuck's on?
